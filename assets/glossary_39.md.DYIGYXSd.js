The impetus to the process was the Baptism of Poland (), the personal baptism of Mieszko I, the first ruler of the future Polish state, and much of his court. The ceremony took place on the Holy Saturday of 14 April 966, although the exact location is still disputed by historians, with the cities of Poznań and Gniezno being the most likely sites. Mieszko's wife, Dobrawa of Bohemia, is often credited as a major influence on Mieszko's decision to accept Christianity. While the spread of Christianity in Poland took centuries to finish, the process was ultimately successful, as within several decades Poland joined the rank of established European states recognised by the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. According to historians, the baptism of Poland marks the beginning of Polish statehood. Nevertheless, the Christianization was a long and arduous process, as most of the Polish population remained pagan until the pagan reaction during the 1030s. Background Dobrawa, Mieszko's wife who played a major role in Poland's conversion to Christianity. Before the adoption of Christianity in modern-day Poland, there were a number of different pagan tribes. Svetovid was among the most widespread pagan gods worshiped in Poland. Christianity arrived around the late 9th century, most likely around the time when the Vistulan tribe encountered the Christian rite in dealings with their neighbors, the Great Moravia (Bohemian) state. The Moravian cultural influence played a significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion. In the opinion of Davies, the Christianization of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican. =Baptism= Mieszko I, the first Christian ruler of Poland. Depicted by Jan Matejko as holding a crucifix in an allusion to the Baptism of Poland. The \\"Baptism of Poland\\" refers to the ceremony when the first ruler of the Polish state, Mieszko I and much of his court, converted to the Christian religion. Mieszko's wife Dobrawa of Bohemia, a zealous Christian, played a significant role in promoting Christianity in Poland, and might have had a significant influence on converting Mieszko himself. The exact place of Mieszko's baptism is disputed; Most historians argue that Gniezno or Poznań are the most likely sites. However, other historians have suggested alternative locations, such as Ostrów Lednicki, or even in German Regensburg. The date of Mieszko's baptism was 14 April 966, Holy Saturday. The ceremony was preceded by a week of oral catechism and several days of fasting. The actual ceremony involved pouring water over the segregated groups of men and women, although it is possible that their heads were immersed instead, and anointed with the chrism. =Christianization of Poland= The baptismal mission which began in the two major cities of Gniezno and Poznań with the baptism of Mieszko and his court spread throughout the country. During the 10th and 11th centuries various ecclesiastical organs were established in Poland. This included the building of churches and the appointment of clergy. The first Bishop of Poland, Jordan, was appointed by Pope John XIII in 968. Mieszko's son Bolesław I Chrobry supported Christianization missions to neighboring lands, notably the mission of future Saint Adalbert of Prague to Old Prussians, and established the Archbishopric of Gniezno in the year 1000. Although at first the Christian religion was \\"unpopular and alien\\", Mieszko's baptism was highly influential but needed to be enforced by the state, and ran into some popular opposition, including an uprising in the 1030s (particularly intense in the years of 1035–1037). Nonetheless, by that time Poland had won recognition as a proper European state, from both the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. Out of various provinces of today's Poland, Christianity's spread was slowest in Pomerania, where it gained a significant following only around the 12th century. Initially, the clergy came from the Western Christian European countries; native Polish clergy took three or four generations to emerge, and were supported by the monasteries and friars that grew increasingly common in the 12th century. By the 13th century Roman Catholicism had become the dominant religion throughout Poland. In adopting Christianity as the state religion, Mieszko sought to achieve several personal goals. He saw Poland's baptism as a way of strengthening his hold on power, as well as using it as a unifying force for the Polish people. It replaced several smaller cults with a single, central one, clearly associated with the royal court. It would also improve the position and respectability of the Polish state on the international, European scene. The Church also helped to strengthen the monarch's authority and brought to Poland much experience with regard to state administration. Thus, the Church organisation supported the state, and in return, bishops received important government titles (in the later era, they were members of the Senate of Poland). Millennial celebrations of 1966 Contemporary mural in Gniezno commemorating the baptism of Poland. Ceremonial cavalry during the parade in 1966. The preparations for the millennial celebrations begun with the Great Novena of 1957, which marked a nine years period of fast and prayer. In 1966, the People's Republic of Poland witnessed large festivities on the 1,000-year anniversary of those events, with the Church celebrating the 1,000 years of Christianity in Poland, while the Communist government celebrated the secular 1,000 years of the Polish State, culminated in twice denying Pope Paul VI permission to visit Poland that year. The desire of the Communist party to separate religion from the state made the festivities a culture clash between the state and the Church. While the Church was focusing on the religious, ecclesiastical aspects of the baptism, with slogans (in Latin) like Sacrum Poloniae Millenium (Poland's Sacred Millennium), the Communist Party was framing the celebrations as a secular, political anniversary of the creation of the Polish state, with slogans (in Polish) like Tysiąclecie Państwa Polskiego (A Thousand Years of the Polish State). As Norman Davies noted, both the Church and the Party had \\"rival, and mutually exclusive, interpretations of [Poland's baptism] significance.\\" On 30 July 1966, the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing issued 128,475,000 commemorative stamps honoring the millennium anniversary of the adoption of Christianity in Poland.U.S. #1313 Polish Millennium MNH An anniversary parade was held in front of the Palace of Culture and Science on Parade Square on 22 July to coincide with the annual National Day of the Rebirth of Poland celebrations (set on the anniversary of the signing of the PKWN Manifesto). It was attended by Władysław Gomułka, the then First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, as well as members of the PUWP and the Polish Council of State. The parade inspector was Marshal of Poland Marian Spychalski while it was commanded by the commander of the Warsaw Military District Major General Czesław Waryszak (1919-1979). Troops of the Polish People's Army were on parade, featuring units such as the Representative Honor Guard of the LWP, the Band of the LWP (led by Colonel Lisztok), as well as cadets of military academies and other ceremonial units dressed in Polish historical military uniforms dating back to the Piast dynasty. The parade is today regarded as the largest military parade in the history of Poland.https://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/historia/1668606,1,jak- wygladala-najwieksza-parada-wojskowa-w-historii-polski.read See also * Catholic Church in Poland * Lech, Czech, and Rus * Christianization of Bohemia * Christianization of Kievan Rus' * Dagome Iudex * History of Poland (966–1385) * List of archbishops of Gniezno and primates of Poland * Northern Crusades Notes External link * Category:History of Christianity in Poland Category:Baptism Category:10th-century Christianity Category:966 Category:10th century in Poland Category:Christianization of Europe ","title":"Christianization of Poland"},{"id":"2606604","text":"Uttanasana Uttanasana (; ) or Standing Forward Bend, with variants such as Padahastasana where the toes are grasped, is a standing forward bending asana in modern yoga as exercise.

The pose is a modern one, first seen in the 20th century. A pose with the name Uttānāsana is illustrated in the 19th century Sritattvanidhi but it is quite different from the modern pose (lying on the back, with elbows touching the knees and the hands behind the neck). The modern pose is described in Krishnamacharya's 1934 Yoga Makaranda, and in the works of his pupils, B. K. S. Iyengar's 1966 Light on Yoga and Pattabhi Jois's Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. Theos Bernard however illustrates the related pose \\"Padhahasthasana\\" (sic) in his 1944 report of his experience of hatha yoga on the border of India and Tibet, suggesting the existence of a separate tradition. Description The pose is entered from the standing position of Tadasana, bending forward at the hips until the palms can be placed on the floor, ultimately behind the heels. Variations Padahastasana Variations include: * Ardha Uttanasana is a halfway stage, the trunk horizontal and the palms resting on the calves. * Niralamba Uttanasana has the hands touching the waistband rather than reaching down. * Padahastasana has the hands under the toes and feet, palms up.

He played a major role in the popularization of the new game and was widely regarded as \\"the man who made contract bridge\\". He was a great showman who became rich, was highly extravagant, and lost and gained fortunes several times over. Life Culbertson was born in Poiana Vărbilău in Romania to an American mining engineer, Almon Culbertson, and his Russian wife, Xenya Rogoznaya. He attended the École des sciences économiques et politiques at the Sorbonne in Paris, and the University of Geneva. His facility for languages was extraordinary: he spoke Russian, English, French, German, Czech and Spanish fluently, with a reading knowledge of five others, and a knowledge of Latin and classical Greek. In spite of his education, his erudition was largely self-acquired: he was a born autodidact. After the Russian Revolution (1917), Culbertson lived for four years in Paris and other European cities by exploiting his skill as a card player. In 1921 he moved to the United States, earning his living from winnings at auction bridge and poker. In 1923 he married Mrs. Josephine Murphy Dillon, a successful teacher of auction bridge and a leading woman player, in Manhattan.White, James Terry, The National Encyclopedia of American biography, vol. 46, , p. 106. They were successful as both players and teachers, and later as publishers. Josephine Culbertson retained the surname after their divorce in 1938; indeed, a revised edition of Culbertson's Contract Bridge in Ten Minutes was published under her name in 1951.Search results for 'culbertson, josephine' (numbers 41–50 of 73). WorldCat. Retrieved 2014-12-30. Gradually the new game of contract bridge began to replace auction bridge, and Culbertson saw his opportunity to overtake the leaders of auction bridge. Culbertson planned a far-reaching and successful campaign to promote himself as the leader of the new game. As player, organizer, bidding theorist, magazine editor, and team leader, he was a key figure in the growth of contract bridge in its great boom years of the 1930s.Francis et al (1994), p. 602.Clay (1985), Preface, p. viii. Culbertson was a brilliant publicist; he played several famous challenge matches and won them all. Two were played in the U.S., against s led by Sidney Lenz in 1931–32 (the so-called \\"Bridge Battle of the Century\\") and by P. Hal Sims in 1935, the latter between the married couples Culbertson and Sims. Four matches were played in England, against Walter Buller's team in 1930, against \\"Pops\\" Beasley's team in 1930 and 1933, and against Col. George Walshe's team in 1934. These matches were typically accompanied by noteworthy publicity in newspapers, on radio and on cinema newsreels, and the hands became the subject of intense discussion on bidding methods.Clay (1985). Later, a match did not materialize against the leading American team of the mid-1930s, the \\"Four Aces\\". Culbertson was finally beaten in Budapest, June 1937, in the final match of the first world championship teams tournament, by the 6-man Austria team led by Dr. Paul Stern. It was his last appearance in a tournament or match.Clay (1985), Introduction, p. 3. Culbertson founded and edited The Bridge World magazine, which is still published today, and wrote many newspaper articles and books on bridge. He owned the first firm of playing card manufacturers to develop plastic cards, Kem Cards, and developed and owned a chain of bridge schools with teachers qualified in the Culbertson bidding system. He continued to play high-stakes rubber bridge for many years, but gave up tournament and match competition in 1938 to write and to work for world peace. Total Peace (1943) and Must We Fight Russia? (1947) were his most important books. Challenge matches These matches received great publicity, being extensively covered in the newspapers, often making the front pages. By winning them, Culbertson suggested to the bridge-playing public that the Culbertson System of bidding was superior to the systems of his rivals, and thereby boosted the sales of his books. But according to his team-mate Theodore Lightner: \\"Ely's real advantage was that his team was much stronger than anything others could possibly muster, We could have played different systems and won just as easily.\\"Mollo, Victor (1967), The Bridge Immortals, Faber and Faber, p. 149. Also published 1968 by Hart Publishing Company, New York; p. 201. =Culbertson–Lenz match= This pairs match took place during December 1931 and January 1932 at two New York City hotels, and was called the \\"Bridge Battle of the Century\\". Sidney Lenz was the leader of a group of players opposed to Culbertson's domination of the game, and who called their bidding system the Official System. Culbertson challenged Lenz to a match, wagering $5,000 against his opponent's $1,000, with the money to go to charity regardless of the outcome. The winning Austrian team at the 1937 World Championships: from left, Karl Schneider, Hans Jellinek, Edouard Frischauer, Paul Stern (Capt.), Josephine Culbertson (US), Walter Herbert, Helen Sobel (US), and Karl von Blöhdorn The match was played as rubber bridge, with 150 rubbers being played. Culbertson played 88 of these with his wife, Josephine, partnering one of Theodore Lightner, Waldemar von Zedtwitz, Howard Schenken and Michael T. Gottlieb in the remainder. Lenz played with Oswald Jacoby for the first 103 rubbers, but Jacoby then resigned following a heated difference of opinion over a defensive play. According to the match referee, Lt. Alfred Gruenther (later 4-star General and Supreme Allied Commander Europe 1953-56), Jacoby said following that deal, \\"I made a play that only twelve players in the country would understand, and unfortunately Mr Lenz did not seem, at that particular moment, to be among that twelve.\\" Cmdr. Winfield Liggett, Jr., was Lenz's partner for the rest of the match, which Culbertson won by 8,980 points.Francis et al (1994), pp. 91–92. Terence Reese said \\"The Official System (Lenz) ... was discredited ... That the Culbertsons did not win more easily (for their constructive bidding was much better than that of their opponents) was due to the fact that Jacoby was a player of quite different class from any of the others.\\"Reese, Terence (1963), \\"The bridge battle of the century\\". British Bridge World, August 1963, pp. 38–43. The rest of the match was described in subsequent issues. Jacoby's psychic bids and his competitive bidding generally kept the Lenz team in the match; but Lenz himself could not tolerate Jacoby's style. =Anglo-American matches= Lt. Col. Walter Buller promoted a bidding system that he called \\"British Bridge\\", which used direct methods and avoided approach forcing bids as had been incorporated in the Culbertson System. His challenge was accepted by Culbertson, and a teams of four match took place in London in 1930. The Culbertson team won by 4,845 total points over 200 deals. Culbertson partnered his wife, Josephine, and his other pair comprised Lightner and von Zedtwitz. Later in the match Culbertson played with Lightner, and his wife played with von Zedwitz: this was the more successful line-up. The other three members of Buller's team were Alice Evers, Cedric Kehoe and Nelson Wood-Hill.Francis et al (1994), pp. 584, 816. Immediately after the Buller match, the Culbertson team played another match, against Crockford's Club. The Crockford's team was 'Pops' Beasley (Captain), Sir Guy Domville, George Morris and Captain Hogg; the match over 200 boards was won by Culbertson by 4,905 points (total points scoring).Clay (1985), p. 106. Match for the Schwab Cup, 1933. At table, from left: E. Culbertson, Lady Doris Rhodes, referee Col. GGJ Walshe, J. Culbertson, Pops Beasley. Behind, far left: Hubert Phillips. The matches in 1933 and 1934 both took place for the Schwab Cup, a trophy presented for Anglo-American matches by Charles Schwab, an American industrialist and patron of bridge, who was president of the Whist Club of New York. In 1933, Michael Gottlieb replaced von Zedtwitz in the Culbertson team. The British team consisted of Lt. Col. 'Pops' Beasley and Sir Guy Domville, Percy Tabbush and George Morris, Graham Mathieson and Lady Doris Rhodes (pairs were sometimes aligned differently). The Culbertson team won by 10,900 total points over 300 hands, a decisive but not overwhelming victory. The following year, again in London, the Schwab trophy pitted the Culbertson team for the first time against a team with \\"two very experienced partnerships\\" [Reese] captained by Col. George Walshe. The American team consisted of the Culbertsons, Teddy Lightner and Albert Morehead. The British team was Richard Lederer and Willie Rose; Harry Ingram and Stanley Hughes,Reese, Terence (1974). Obituary of Henry St. John Ingram 1888–1974; reprinted in Hasenson, Peter British Bridge Almanack (2004) 77, London, p. 196. with captain Walshe and A. Frost as reserves. Culbertson's team won by 3,650 points over 300 deals. At one time the British team had built up a lead of over 5,000 points, and the Americans led by only 970 points with one session, of 30 deals, remaining. The Lederer–Rose pair tired but refused to take a rest; the last set was a disaster.Francis et al (1994), pp. 733, 816.Reese, Terence (1977), Bridge at the Top, Faber and Faber, , pp. 19–22. Ingram referred to the element of fatigue when he remarked that at least three of the English players had done a day's work before the evening sessions, while the Americans did not get up until lunchtime.Ingram, H. St. John (1962–63). \\"The brave old days\\". The British Bridge World, December 1962–March 1963. This may be the only account of the match of any length; no book of the match was published. All the same, Walshe's team had shown that the great Culbertson team was vulnerable. They were eventually beaten by Dr. Paul Stern's Austrian team, the best European team of the 1930s. Anglo-American matches after World War II, of which there were a number,Francis et al (1994). did not involve Culbertson. Bridge accomplishments =Honors= In 1964 The Bridge World honored Harold S. Vanderbilt, Culbertson, and Charles Goren as the first three members of a bridge hall of fame.

Biography  Guy Sorman has written twenty books that promote the ideals of creativity and modern capitalism. His views are close to classical liberalism. His ideas about renewable energy and environmentalism, as expressed in his book Progress and its Enemies, are particularly controversial. He is assertive in regard to human rights in China and in regard to democracy in many places including Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Chile, Poland, and Argentina. Sorman was a founder of a French NGO, Action against Hunger (ACF), in 1979 and was its President until 1990, when he became its Honorary President. He is the global advisor of the South Korean President. Sorman has held many government positions in France. Guy Sorman is also a publisher: his company, Éditions Sorman, publishes 14 weekly newsletters in France and the magazine France Amérique in the United States. Sorman is the author of thirty books on contemporary affairs. He is a regular columnist for Le Figaro in France, the Wall Street Journal and City Journal (as a contributing editor) in the United States, ABC in the Kingdom of Spain, Dong-a Ilbo in South Korea, Fakt in Poland, La Nación in Argentina, and other foreign publications. Sorman taught economics at the Paris Institute of Political Studies from 1970 to 2000 and at foreign Universities. In 1985, he was a visiting scholar at Stanford, Hoover Institution. He has also held several public offices, including advisor to the Prime Minister of France (1995-1997), Member of the National Commission for Human Rights, deputy mayor of Boulogne (since 1995), near Paris, and recently as Chairman of \\"Greater Paris West\\" Economic and Social Council. He attended the New York Carnegie Council on April 9, 2008, where he talked about China and how it is socially developing as a nation, presenting his new book The Empire of Lies (Newly translated into English). He said, \\"There are not 2 million Tibetans in China. There are 1 billion Tibetans in China.\\" The idea was to show that Chinese people also suffer the same oppression as Tibetans in his view. Like the Dalai Lama, he also did not want China to be boycotted during the Olympics. Sorman's book on economy as a science, Economics doesn't lie, A Defense of the Free Market in a time of Crisis, was published July 2009, by Encounter New York. Also in one of his lectures, \\"Should we fear China?\\" in January 2011, at Asan Institute for Policy Studies, he mentioned China as a \\"country to be concerned about because its unpredictability will continue as long as it maintains its economic policies and the Communist Party’s role in the government.\\" He further stated that Chinese economy needs innovation and needs to make its exchange currency, Renminbi convertible. Guy Sorman has also written many articles regarding globalization and Asia's growing economy. In his \\"What is the West?\\",(2008) he claimed the term \\"westernization\\" is vague, and it is hard to draw a line between the west and the east. In his \\"What Asian Century?\\" (2010) he stated that in Asia, there are still too many weaknesses, such as absence of coordinating institutions, no innovations, and declining Asian countries, for the 21st century to become the Asian Century, as many scholars predict. Instead, he believes we have entered the \\"Global Century\\" where interdependence on one another increases and where there is no such thing as \\"national economy\\" or \\"national problem.\\" Guy Sorman is Jewish. He became a US citizen in 2015, now holding French dual citizenship. In 2018, he was awarded the Legion d'Honneur (Officier) the highest French distinction, for his Franco-American activities.

It is located in Kwai Fong, near Kwai Fong MTR station. It was built by the Regional Council and opened in November 1999 to provide a medium-size venue for performances. It has an 899-seat auditorium, a black box theatre, and various smaller function rooms. History A working group appointed by the Recreation and Culture Select Committee of the former Regional Council presented a report, on 13 May 1989, that observed \\"a dearth of purpose-built, well-located, medium-sized civic centres\\" in the council's service area. As a result, the council began studying building such a venue within Kwai Tsing District. On 31 May 1990 the council approved, in principle, the provision of a new civic centre in Kwai Tsing District. In the planning stages it was called the Kwai Tsing Civic Centre. Construction began in 1994. The theatre was planned and designed by the Architectural Services Department, a department of the Hong Kong Government. It was engineered by Ove Arup & Partners and built by China International Water & Electric Corporation. The theatre was officially opened by Lau Wong-fat, chairman of the Provisional Regional Council, on 18 November 1999. It cost HK$468 million. Since 2000, the theatre has been managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD). In early 2008, the exhibition gallery was converted into the LCSD's first black box theatre. The renovation was completed in response to local arts groups concerned by the shortage of smaller performance venues in Hong Kong.

In blue, the orbit generated starting from 1/2. In mathematics, an interval exchange transformation. is a kind of dynamical system that generalises circle rotation. The phase space consists of the unit interval, and the transformation acts by cutting the interval into several subintervals, and then permuting these subintervals. Formal definition Let n > 0 and let \\\\pi be a permutation on 1, \\\\dots, n. Consider a vector \\\\lambda = (\\\\lambda_1, \\\\dots, \\\\lambda_n) of positive real numbers (the widths of the subintervals), satisfying :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\lambda_i = 1. Define a map T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda}:[0,1]\\\\rightarrow [0,1], called the interval exchange transformation associated with the pair (\\\\pi,\\\\lambda) as follows. For 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n let :a_i = \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq j < i} \\\\lambda_j \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad a'_i = \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq j < \\\\pi(i)} \\\\lambda_{\\\\pi^{-1}(j)}. Then for x \\\\in [0,1], define : T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda}(x) = x - a_i + a'_i if x lies in the subinterval [a_i,a_i+\\\\lambda_i). Thus T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda} acts on each subinterval of the form [a_i,a_i+\\\\lambda_i) by a translation, and it rearranges these subintervals so that the subinterval at position i is moved to position \\\\pi(i). Properties Any interval exchange transformation T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda} is a bijection of [0,1] to itself preserves the Lebesgue measure. It is continuous except at a finite number of points. The inverse of the interval exchange transformation T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda} is again an interval exchange transformation. In fact, it is the transformation T_{\\\\pi^{-1}, \\\\lambda'} where \\\\lambda'_i = \\\\lambda_{\\\\pi^{-1}(i)} for all 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n. If n=2 and \\\\pi = (12) (in cycle notation), and if we join up the ends of the interval to make a circle, then T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda} is just a circle rotation. The Weyl equidistribution theorem then asserts that if the length \\\\lambda_1 is irrational, then T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda} is uniquely ergodic. Roughly speaking, this means that the orbits of points of [0,1] are uniformly evenly distributed. On the other hand, if \\\\lambda_1 is rational then each point of the interval is periodic, and the period is the denominator of \\\\lambda_1 (written in lowest terms). If n>2, and provided \\\\pi satisfies certain non-degeneracy conditions (namely there is no integer 0 < k < n such that \\\\pi(\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,k\\\\\\\\}) = \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,k\\\\\\\\}), a deep theorem which was a conjecture of M.Keane and due independently to William A. Veech. and to Howard Masur . asserts that for almost all choices of \\\\lambda in the unit simplex \\\\\\\\{(t_1, \\\\dots, t_n) : \\\\sum t_i = 1\\\\\\\\} the interval exchange transformation T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda} is again uniquely ergodic. However, for n \\\\geq 4 there also exist choices of (\\\\pi,\\\\lambda) so that T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda} is ergodic but not uniquely ergodic. Even in these cases, the number of ergodic invariant measures of T_{\\\\pi,\\\\lambda} is finite, and is at most n. Odometers Dyadic odometer T Dyadic odometer iterated twice; that is T^2. Dyadic odometer thrice iterated; that is T^3. Dyadic odometer iterated four times; that is T^4. The dyadic odometer can be understood as an interval exchange transformation of a countable number of intervals. The dyadic odometer is most easily written as the transformation :T\\\\left(1,\\\\dots,1,0,b_{k+1},b_{k+2},\\\\dots\\\\right) = \\\\left(0,\\\\dots,0,1,b_{k+1},b_{k+2},\\\\dots \\\\right) defined on the Cantor space \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^\\\\mathbb{N}. The standard mapping from Cantor space into the unit interval is given by :(b_0,b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots)\\\\mapsto x=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty b_n2^{-n-1} This mapping is a measure-preserving homomorphism from the Cantor set to the unit interval, in that it maps the standard Bernoulli measure on the Cantor set to the Lebesgue measure on the unit interval. A visualization of the odometer and its first three iterates appear on the right.

Counterpart funds were used by the UNRRA, and the Marshall Plan in the rebuilding of Western Europe after the Second World War,Greg Behrman, The Marshall Plan, Aurum Press Ltd., 2008, pp. 178,179,232. and today remain a common technique for delivering development assistance. One method of setting up a counterpart fund is to, first, arrange for businesses in the aid-recipient country that want to import goods pay for imports in local currency. The aid-recipient government can then use foreign assistance (still perhaps in $US) to pay for the goods. This makes importing easier because it is usually easier to make payments in $US than in local currencies. Import funds supplied by donor countries are also often tied to imports from the donor countries. Trade agreements are often arranged so that imports can only come from the nation that provides assistance. This approach benefits the donor's export industry. Another method for establishing counterpart funds is for goods (such as food aid) to be donated to an aid- recipient nation. The recipient government can then sell the goods and use the proceeds (received in local currency) to set up a counterpart fund. In these ways, the recipient government can establish counterpart funds in local currency. These payments are amalgamated into a fund that is used to further fund development spending. Further spending can take the form of investments in infrastructure or industry, paying down the debt or deficit, or stabilizing the currency. The investment of these funds can take the form of loans rather than grants, creating a permanent pool of investment capital. For instance, Germany's Marshall Plan counterpart funds were used to set up such an investment fund, and it is still in operation today. Example Suppose, in 1949, a German construction company had wished to purchase an American crane for reconstruction efforts in Germany. In a counterpart fund arrangement, company would have bought the crane from the West German government in Deutschmarks. The Deutschmarks would then have been deposited into the central bank. The Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), the body mediating counterpart funds, would have paid the American crane exporter in $US authorized under the European Recovery Program (ERP). Meanwhile, the Deutschmarks would have been used to finance an ECA-approved recovery project. There were several benefits to this transaction. First, instead of a direct transfer of an asset or converting currency for imports, this system incentivized participation in the economy (in this case, Germany) using local currency. For the German construction company, the entire transaction occurred in West Germany and was arranged by the fledgling government. Furthermore, because the payment was in local currency, there was no negative effect on the West German balance of payments, which was a major concern of the ERP. Lastly, instead of resorting to inflationary policies as had often been done in post- war recoveries, the central bank had an inflow of currency to lend for projects.

It is a day/boarding school for children aged 0–18. The school incorporates Nursery, Pre-Prep, Junior and Senior schools. The current Head Teacher of the Senior School (11–18) is Dr Lorraine Earps. Mrs Tracey Khodabandehloo is Headmistress of the Junior School (0–11) History First known as the Wesleyan Collegiate Institute, Queen's College was established by the Wesleyan Methodist Church in 1843. Originally located in the Norman Castle in the town centre, the school opened with 34 pupils on 12 July 1843. Under the Headship of Thomas Sibley the school outgrew the old school classrooms and so a new building was commissioned in 1845 in the Trull area. Due to the increasing popularity of the school, they were forced to vacate the castle premises in 1847 and move into the new building before it was finished. The current school building is a symmetrical Tudor Gothic building built by Giles and Gane in 1845 and has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. The original school site consisted of the main school building and upper playing fields. Since then the buildings have expanded, with the bridge and Library (now known as the Old Music Room) being added to the school in the 1920s. This addition was built in commemoration, along with the obelisk on the front lawn, for those who served in the First World War.  Current Day  Since the school moved to its current location, there has been a significant expansion of the site to meet demand. With the addition of the lower playing fields, the Junior school building and the dormitories the school now sits in approximately of grounds. Facilities at the school include a sports centre with gym and heated pool, dedicated Chemistry, Physics and Biology block, DT workshop, Food nutrition classroom, IT Suites, Library and Learning Resource Centre, art studios, Drama Studio and, theatre seating 550. Since the 1970s the school has been co-educational with both female and male boarding houses being present on the school grounds. The college's motto isnon scholae sed vitae discimus (\\"We educate not just for school but for life’\\") In 2016 the school appointed their first female Head Teacher, Dr Lorraine Earps, who has driven a major refurbishment project including the upgrading of the old school room (then known as the Performing Arts Centre, now known as the Wyvern Hall) into a leading space for lectures, dance and music recitals as well as formal dinners and conferences.  Methodist Church  The school is part of the Methodist trust and this plays a significant role in the charitable and social actions of the school. This is overseen by the resident school chaplain who is responsible for the social development and responsibilities of the school and its pupils. Sports The school has sports teams in cricket, rugby union, hockey, swimming, athletics, netball and tennis. The school also provides other popular disciplines such as rock climbing, kayaking, mountain biking, canoe polo, fencing, Duke of Edinburgh Award, mountaineering, badminton and horse riding. Arts Queen's College teaches performing arts, including drama and music, and dance. The Quartz festival, running from the first Wednesday of October each year for ten days, attracts over 6,000 visitors annually.

Lippert libraries, but both companies soon entered television distribution. It also served syndication for Monogram Pictures and Producers Releasing Corporation. In 1951, Hyman sold the company to David Baird's Lansing Foundation, then to the startup company Motion Pictures for Television (MPTV), where Hyman served as a consultant. Hyman also became a partner in Mouline Productions, the producers of Moby Dick, while financing and producing other films and TV projects. =Associated Artists Productions= In July 1954, Hyman launched another TV distribution company which used the Associated Artists name, Associated Artists Productions, Inc., with the purchase of the syndication rights to the Universal Sherlock Holmes films from MPTV. His son Ken served as vice- president. Associated Artists Productions also acquired distribution right to Johnny Jupiter, Candid Camera, 13 Artcinema Associates feature films, 37 Western films and 3 serials. In March 1956, Hyman's company was acquired by an investment firm headed by Lou Chesler named PRM, Inc. PRM closed the purchase of the entire pre-1950 library owned by Warner Bros. Pictures in February 1956 for $21 million with a.a.p. and its theatrical subsidiary Dominant Pictures handling distribution sales. In December 1956, PRM changed its name to Associated Artists Productions Corp. a.a.p. also purchased the Popeye cartoons from Paramount Pictures, which had been produced by Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios, in June 1956. This purchase and the Warner Bros. cartoon package combined gave a.a.p. a library of over 568 theatrical cartoon shorts, which would be staples of children's television for many years. In January 1957, a.a.p announced plans to purchase the short subject library of Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer for $4,500,000. 900 shorts would be included in the package such as the Tom and Jerry cartoons and Pete Smith comedies, among others. Although the deal was nearly finalized, it fell through, reportedly due to the price of the sale. MGM would then distribute the shorts themselves through their own in-house television subsidiary Metro TV. National Telefilm Associates announced plans to buy control of AAP Corp. in November 1957. By December 1957, control of a.a.p. was the subject of litigation which was passed on to the New York Supreme Court between the parties of a.a.p., National Telefilm Associates, and Harris minority shareholder group. =United Artists Associated= The company was acquired by United Artists (UA) in 1958, with UA borrowing the full amount $27 million from Manufacturers's Trust when a.a.p. shareholders needed cash quickly. The a.a.p. purchase did come with the uncollected accounts' receivable amount around the purchase price. The resulting division was named United Artists Associated, Inc. (u.a.a.). u.a.a. made a deal to distribute Beany and Cecil internationally. With the twin syndicated packages of Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies and Popeye, u.a.a. took a look at a number of shorts in the a.a.p./pre-1950 WB library that appealed to children and packaged them in a third group known as The Big Mac Show, which has a cartoon wrap around. Distribution rights The material a.a.p. bought from Warner Bros. Pictures included all of its features produced and distributed by Warner Bros. prior to 1950 (Warner Bros. retained the rights to two 1949 films it only distributed), and also included was the film Chain Lightning (produced in 1949 and released in 1950). Also included were the live-action short subjects released prior to September 1, 1948. The cartoon library included every color Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies short released prior to August 1, 1948, and all of the Merrie Melodies produced by Harman- Ising Productions from 1931 to 1933, except Lady, Play Your Mandolin! (1931). The remaining black-and-white Merrie Melodies made from 1933 to 1934 and the black-and-white Looney Tunes were not included in the library. Former Warner cartoon director Bob Clampett was hired to catalog the Warner cartoon library. Film archive In 1969, the United Artists Corporation presented to the Library of Congress the earliest surviving preprint material from the pre-1950 film library of Warner Bros. (including First National library). The collection contains 200 silent features (1918–29), 800 sound features (1926–50), 1,800 sound shorts (1926–48), and 337 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts (1931–48). While consisting largely of Warner Bros. releases, the collection includes nearly two hundred sound features released by Monogram Pictures Corporation between 1936 and 1946 and 231 Popeye cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios released between 1933 and 1957. Most motion pictures exist in the original black-and-white/Technicolor camera negatives. The Library is converting the nitrate film to safety stock and has obtained reference prints for seventy of the better known Warner Bros. features, such as Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935), High Sierra (1941), I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), The Jazz Singer (1927), and Little Caesar (1930). There are no United Artists films (such as James Bond and The Pink Panther franchise; these are owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) in the United Artists Collection. The early synchronized sound Vitaphone shorts are lacking accompanying sound discs. This is a large collection of nitrate negatives and masters, which are still undergoing transfer to acetate stock. Most of the safety film copies exist only in the preservation master stage, limiting accessibility for viewing and duplication. Some years ago, LC obtained 16mm prints (though many are television prints, flat in picture quality and occasionally edited) for pre-1950 Warner Bros. features (among the most popular of all American films). Additional prints have been added to the collection, ranging from \\"reject fine grain master positives\\" (copies made for preservation but deemed inadequate) suitable for reference use, to high- quality 35mm prints reserved for theatrical projection. United Artists also donated 16mm prints of most of the Warner Bros. and Monogram films to the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research, such as My Four Years in Germany (1918),My Four Years in Germany (1918) Conductor 1492 (1924), Midnight Lovers (1926) and Joe Palooka in Triple Cross (1951). Titles and holdings are listed in the various M/B/RS catalogs. There are a number of published reference books on Warner Bros. films.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress by The American Film Institute, c. 1978. Copyrights are still in effect for most of the films in this collection; a donor restriction also applies. United Artists has passed through various hands, but current ownership of this material resides with Turner Entertainment Co. Ownership of properties Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased United Artists (along with the a.a.p. library) from Transamerica Corporation in 1981 and became MGM/UA Entertainment Co. The rights to Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 film Rope, originally distributed by Warner Bros. (with MGM) and later copyrighted by UATV, reverted to the director in 1968. Distribution rights were later acquired by Universal Pictures in 1983. Turner Broadcasting System (via Turner Entertainment Co.) took over the library in 1986 after Ted Turner's short-lived ownership of MGM/UA. When Turner sold back the MGM/UA production unit, he kept the MGM library, including select portions of the a.a.p. library (limited to the Warner Bros. films and the Popeye cartoons), for his own company. The 1936–1946 Monogram films were not included with the purchase, and thus some of these films remain with MGM. The Warner Bros. film libraries were reunited when Time Warner (now WarnerMedia), the studio's parent company since the 1990 merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications (formerly Kinney National Company), bought Turner in 1996. Turner remains the copyright owner in name only to the former Associated Artists Productions properties, while WarnerMedia handles their distribution. UA originally leased video rights to their library (including the a.a.p. library) to Magnetic Video, the first home video company. Magnetic Video was sold to 20th Century Fox in 1982, becoming 20th Century-Fox Video. In 1982, Fox and CBS formed CBS/Fox Video, which continued to distribute the UA/a.a.p. library under license from MGM/UA Home Video until the rights reverted to MGM/UA. After Turner's purchase of the MGM/UA library, MGM/UA Home Video continued to distribute the films on video under license until 1999. MGM/UA paid Time Warner US$225 million to end their contract of distributing the Associated Artists Productions library early. The rights to distribute were then transferred to Warner Home Video in 2000. Laboratory in Brooklyn to Consolidated Labs in N.J. thus avoiding the New York sales tax on the purchase. Subsequently the negatives were split up between several labs in the NY area including DuArt, Mercury, Deluxe and CFI. Each lab made new acetate 16mm internegatives and re-recorded sound tracks. Some of the color films were in Technicolor and, as was Technicolor's policy, they held the 3 color negatives and mage prints. TV stations used 16mm prints for their telecasting and each lab made the prints for the titles they held. These same prints would be the ones used on pre-1999 VHS and laserdisc releases of former a.a.p.-owned films. The a.a.p. versions of these films were also later used for cable television broadcasts (even as recently as March 2011, a.a.p. prints of WB cartoons have been seen on TV). Early releases of WB films released between 1918–1931 bore an a.a.p. copyright renewal notice, since these renewals came before the UA purchase, however those copyrights have since been reassigned to Turner. In 1995, Turner began removing the a.a.p. logos from many of the films (although this process started before that by both UA and local television stations). With the a.a.p. logos being removed, Turner also began creating \\"dubbed versions\\" that same year, which are available in American and European formats and most had altered ending cards and color borders in the opening titles for the print given, which they kept, for the Warner Bros. cartoons. These \\"dubbed\\" prints attempted to make the material look better with whatever prints they had access to, though some ended up looking worse. One hundred twenty-three of the Warner Bros. cartoons purchased by a.a.p. were restored from their original negatives for inclusion in Warner Home Video's series of six Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD box sets. Several more WB cartoons formerly owned by a.a.p. have been restored for other Looney Tunes DVD releases since 2010. The black and white Popeye cartoons (and the three Color Specials) were also restored from their original negatives for a series of three Popeye the Sailor DVD sets. Subsidiaries * a.a.p. Records, Inc. was a music arm of a.a.p., which distributed the Official Popeye TV Album. * United Telefilms Limited was the Canadian division of a.a.p., which existed around the same time. Live action films used a variation of the main a.a.p. logo, but the initials \\"UTL\\" would be spelled out, and a notice at the bottom said \\"Distributed in Canada by United Telefilms Limited\\".  United Telefilm Records was a music label of United Telefilms. * UT Records was a subsidiary of United Telefilm Records. * Tel Records was another subsidiary of United Telefilm Records. * Warwick Records was also a subsidiary of United Telefilm Records. * Dominant Pictures Corporation was a subsidiary of a.a.p., which distributed the features that the company purchased to theaters. It re-released a number of films from the pre-1950 WB library, as well as a number of British films which a.a.p. bought the rights to. Dominant also sold and/or leased 16mm prints of WB library titles to non-theatrical rental libraries. The subsidiary was later folded into UA's main theatrical distribution arm after the company was sold to UA. Some pre-1931 WB library is considered lost.

Labour Day weekend, roughly 12 or 13 weeks into the CFL season, is known for its matchups that do not change from year to year, unlike other \\"rivalry\\" weeks of the CFL schedule. Labour Day weekend is also one of typically two weeks (the Thanksgiving Day Classic being the other) in the CFL schedule that the league plays on a Monday. Mark's is the presenting sponsor of the event as of 2014. The current weekend matchups involve the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visiting the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the Sunday and on Labour Day itself, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at home against the Toronto Argonauts, while the Edmonton Eskimos visit the Calgary Stampeders. The Montreal Alouettes would normally play against the Ottawa Redblacks on the Thursday or Friday, but after both teams were given a bye week in 2019, the rivalry would be further diminished in 2020 with a scheduled Ottawa vs BC Lions matchup on the weekend. The BC Lions have no geographic rival and would typically have a bye on Labour Day. History The Labour Day Classic began in 1949 and pre-dates the founding of the CFL by nine years. The matchups have remained mostly the same throughout history, except during Montreal and Ottawa's periods of hiatus or due to scheduling conflicts. During the early 1980s, the Montreal Concordes played the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the remaining three teams (Toronto, Ottawa and BC) rotated each year. Ottawa and BC faced each other during the late 1980s and early 1990s while the league had no team in Montreal. Because Ottawa had no active team from 1997–2001 and 2006–2013, the Alouettes usually played the Lions during those seasons, creating a \\"coast-to-coast\\" rivalry. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the entire 2020 CFL season was cancelled and therefore no Labour Day weekend games were played for the first time in CFL history. = Hamilton = Due to scheduling conflicts, the Tiger-Cats temporarily revived its rivalry with the current incarnation of the Alouettes in the Labour Day game for the 2011 season; the change in opponents led Hamilton to dub the game the Labour Day Classique in reference to Montreal's francophone community.Gameday: The Labour Day Classique.From a purely football angle, this Labour Day Classique should be a good one. Hamilton Spectator. Retrieved September 5, 2011. While in 2011, this automatically resulted in Toronto and BC facing each other. In 2013, the Tiger-Cats' did not host a game on Labour Day for only the second time in franchise history (the first being 1995). It was also the first time that they did not host a game on that weekend. Because Ivor Wynne Stadium was demolished to make way for the new Tim Hortons Field, the team played out of Alumni Stadium in Guelph. The University of Guelph Gryphons (along with most Ontario University Athletics teams) were playing that same day, so the Tiger- Cats could not host the game. To make up for it, the Toronto at Hamilton matchup was played in the Thanksgiving Day Classic. For the 2016 contest, to avoid any further conflicts with OUA games, the CFL moved the Toronto/Hamilton matchup to prime time Labour Day evening.Bucholtz, Andrew. Five takeaways from the CFL's 2016 schedule. 55 Yard Line (Yahoo! Sports). Retrieved February 18, 2016. That year, the OUA's McMaster Marauders football team moved its Labour Day matchup with the Toronto Varsity Blues football squad to Tim Hortons Field, creating a doubleheader with a series of concerts in-between games. This was moved back to a 1pm start in 2019.  Related events  Although not directly associated with the Labour Day Classic, the week after Labour Day often has a repeat match-up of the Bombers vs Roughriders (see Banjo Bowl), Stampeders vs Eskimos (see Battle of Alberta), and Tiger-Cats vs Argonauts (a rivalry which began in 1873), with home field advantage now to the team that did not have it during the Labour Day weekend. As the league has been increasing in popularity in recent years, print ads for the Labour Day Classic try to evoke the tradition of watching Canadian football on the last weekend of summer. Slogans include \\"Long Live the Rivalries\\" and \\"Watch the Team You Love Play the Team You Love to Hate\\". Some of the teams wear special third jerseys or throwback uniforms if they play at home.

A trophy has been awarded to the winner of the series since 1979. The Toronto—Hamilton contest is officially known as Football Day in Hamilton and has its own presenting sponsor, WeatherTech Canada.

His work is noted for its self-examination and spiritual imagery. His memoir, A Clip of Steel (1969), portrays the effects of a childhood under a repressive clergyman father. Early Life Blackburn was born in Hensingham, Cumberland, England. He had mixed ancestry. His father, Eliel, was the product of an affair his missionary grandfather had with a Mauritian woman. The mother, who was supposedly beautiful but unstable, disappeared once she returned to Mauritius and the young Eliel was given to the care of an Uncle, where he was brought up to be a passionate Anglican. When Thomas Blackburn was a young boy, Eliel forced him to wear a painful chastity contraption on his groin, to prevent him from being tempted by masturbation. He also had to put up with his father, haunted by feelings of racial inferiority, repeatedly scrubbing his face with peroxide in order to lighten his complexion. The poet Alan Morrison, discussing this experience, noted that 'Blackburn' is 'a cruelly apt surname for someone whose father used to literally try to burn the black off his skin'. He studied law at Selwyn College, Cambridge – which he did not enjoy – at the insistence of his father. He made himself unpopular with some of the students after socialising and partying with two visiting black musicians he had invited into halls. Numerous incidents of misbehaviour, culminating in the discovery of a contraceptive in his room, saw him expelled from college during his third year. This was followed by a short spell as an articled clerk at a law firm; then Brookfield Hall, a treatment centre for alcoholics and drug-addicts, where he was expelled for drunkenly attempting to seduce the wife of one of the medical staff; and finally several months of shock therapy at the hands of a Harley Street doctor. He completed a course in psychology at Birkbeck, University of London, before going on to study English at Durham University (Hatfield College) – the same institution his father had studied theology. On graduating from Durham in June 1940, he moved down to London and became involved with the Soho literary scene. Here he was called up to the Merchant Navy but left after suffering jaundice and instead worked as a lecturer with the National Fire Service, which proved to be his first steps into the world of teaching. Career From 1945 Blackburn worked in a succession of schools across London and at King's School, Rochester. In 1954 he became English Master at Marylebone Grammar School. He held a Gregory Fellowship in poetry at the University of Leeds between 1956 and 1958. He had been nominated for the position by his predecessor, John Heath-Stubbs, and agreed to take the role once he had been approached by the Leeds academic Bonamy Dobrée. These were apparently two of the busier years of his life, with Blackburn throwing himself into university and student activities: he edited an undergraduate poetry journal, Poetry and Audience; held regular poetry sessions at his home in Headingley, sometimes with the participation of his friends and fellow poets Michael Hamburger and George Barker; and helped produce the Leeds University Verse anthology. During his time in Leeds he also developed a close friendship with the literary critic G. Wilson Knight. However, this period was also marred by the breakdown of his marriage with the painter, Rosalie de Meric. At the end of his fellowship he returned to being a teacher in Marylebone. Blackburn taught at the College of St. Mark and St. John in Chelsea, London, as well as other educational institutions. He eventually became head of the English department at St. Mark and St. John. In 1973, when the college decided to move to Plymouth, he decided he would rather stay in London and soon found a job at Whitelands College (now part of the University of Roehampton), retiring in early 1976. In 1969 Blackburn published A Clip of Steel, a memoir of his childhood and early adulthood – republished in 2014 by Valancourt Books. This book was followed two years later by The Feast of the Wolf, a novel inspired by the vampire myth, which is again back in print. Blackburn also published a collection of critical essays and a monograph on Robert Browning. Personal life He was married three times; with his second wife Rosalie he had a daughter, Julia Blackburn, born in 1948. During the marriage he was regularly violent and, on the birth of Julia, became a frequently absent parent returning home drunk after many infidelities which he did not keep secret. Rosalie was described in Julia’s memoir as sexually prolific, though it is suggested this occurred before and then after the end of the marriage to Blackburn, often boasting of her many partners. Blackburn was also an alcoholic and suffered several mental breakdowns during his life. He died from a cerebral haemorrhage at his cottage in Snowdonia as he was getting into bed, immediately after finishing a letter to his brother John.

Commonwealth realms The term was coined in English law to signify the immediate transfer (Law French demise, \\"sending down [the line of succession]\\", from Latin demiss-[gender ending], the perfect participle of demittere, having the same meaning), of sovereignty and royal prerogatives to a successor of the monarch without interregnum. The word \\"demise\\" is sometimes mistakenly interpreted as referring to the death of the Sovereign rather than to the transfer of the Crown. This erroneous meaning is undermined by the principle in constitutional law of the continuity of the monarchy, as expressed in the ancient Medieval maxim \\"the Crown never dies\\" expressed by Sir William Blackstone.Halsbury's Laws of England Crown and Royal family Volume 12 (2) Upon the Crown's demise, in the United Kingdom, a meeting of the Accession Council is held in London in order to give directions for the proclamation of the late monarch's successor. This meeting is to arrange for the formalities; neither the identity nor the accession to the throne of the next monarch depends on it. The proclamation takes place at St James's Palace, Charing Cross, within the City Boundary at Temple Bar, and the Royal Exchange. In Canada the Privy Council for Canada meets in Ottawa to perform the same functions, as does Australia's Federal Executive Council in Canberra, the Executive Council of New Zealand in Wellington and equivalent bodies in the remaining Realms as their shared Monarch holds each of the Crown separately from the others in a personal union. Historically, the demise of the Crown resulted in the immediate dissolution of Parliament. This practice was ended by the Reform Act 1867. The Succession to the Crown Act 1707 provides that in the event of the demise of the Crown, Parliament, if adjourned or prorogued, must meet as soon as possible and if sitting must immediately proceed to act without any summons in the usual form. In Canada, upon the demise of the Crown, the Manual of Official Procedure of the Government of Canada states the prime minister is responsible for convening the Parliament, tabling a resolution of loyalty and condolence from the Parliament to the next monarch of Canada, and arranging for the motion to be seconded by the leader of the Official Opposition. The prime minister will then move to adjourn Parliament. In the UK, under the Representation of the People Act 1985, if the demise of the Crown occurs during a general election, the vote is postponed by fourteen days. At the first meeting of Parliament under a new monarch there is no speech from the Throne. All Members of Parliament and members of the House of Lords take an oath of allegiance to the new Sovereign. The House votes an Address to the Crown in response to the official notification of the previous monarch's demise, expressing condolences upon the death of the previous monarch and pledging loyalty to his or her successor. All civil service and Crown offices also, traditionally, became vacant upon the demise of the Crown. As all staff were employees of the monarch, their employment would end upon the death of the monarch thus all civil servants would have to be rehired and swear out oaths to the new King or Queen. The Demise of the Crown Act 1901 in the UK, and similar legislation in other Commonwealth realms, now makes this process unnecessary – they are all employees of the Crown, rather than any particular Sovereign. The demise of the Crown also brought all legal proceedings to an end, until this rule was abolished by the Demise of the Crown Act 1702. The coronation of the new monarch usually occurs within eighteen months, but is not necessary to secure the succession. East Asia Similar terms are also used in East Asian civilizations, mostly due to Chinese cultural influence: =China= In ancient China, (jiàbēng, \\"mounting the collapse\\") or (yànjià) were used to refer to the passing of the Emperor of China, the Empress, or the Empress Dowager. (bīntiān) was also used as a euphemism, to show that the Emperor has become a guest in Heaven. The Book of Rites mentioned that different words were also used in feudal times when referring to the deaths of people, by their respective social classes: (hōng) was used for feudal vassals and higher officials, (zú) for the king's adviser, (bùlù) for officials, and (sǐ) for commoners. Epochtimes.com 「天子死曰『崩』，諸侯曰『薨』，大夫曰『卒』，士曰『不祿』，庶人曰『死』。」 =Japan= In Japan, \\"崩御\\" (hōgyo, \\"the Emperor has collapsed\\") is used as a respectful term to refer to the passing of the Japanese Emperor or any monarch. It also had an additional meaning, \\"to be hidden\\": as the Emperor of Japan was considered as a descendant of the solar goddess Amaterasu, his passing was also interpreted as \\"the sun has been hidden behind the clouds\\". Other terms similar to those used in the Book of Rites are also used in Japan, in the event of a royal's passing. \\"薨御\\" (kōgyo) is used for the passing of the Empress of Japan, \\"薨去\\" (kōkyo) is used for the passing of the Crown Prince or a third-rank member of the Imperial Household, and \\"卒去\\" (sokkyo, shukkyo) is used for fourth-rank or fifth-rank members of the Imperial Household. Southeast Asia In Brunei, \\"ليندوڠ\\" (lindung) is used in the Malay language to refer the passing of the Sultan of Brunei or the Raja Isteri. For other members of the royal family, \\"مڠکت\\" (mangkat) is used instead. In Malaysia, \\"مڠکت\\" (mangkat) is used in the Malay language to refer the passing of the Malay Rulers and other members of the nine Malay royal families. In Thailand, \\"สวรรคต\\" (sà-wǎn-kót) is used in the Thai language to refer a high-ranking royal person like the King of Thailand and the Crown Prince of Thailand. The term was derived from the Sanskrit language term \\"svargagata\\" (स्वर्गगत), which means \\"has gone to Heaven\\". See also * The king is dead, long live the king!

The rest of the organization was also headed by major business figures such as Arthur A. Kimball (who was a key contributor to the ECA's founding) as well as David K.E. Bruce (who worked at the Office of Strategic Services in Europe during World War II). The ECA had an office in the capital of each of the 16 countries participating in the Marshall Plan. In theory the ECA served as joint administrator of the Marshall Plan development projects in each European country.

It is a part of the municipality of Ano Syros, which lies primarily on the island of Syros. This and other small islands of the Aegean Sea served as places of exile for important persons in the early Roman empire. The extremity of its desolation was proverbial among Roman authors, such as Tacitus and Juvenal. It was a place of exile for leftist political dissidents in Greece from 1948 until 1974. At least 22,000 people were exiled or imprisoned on the island during that time.Red Rocks of the Aegean: Greece’s Prison Islands , New Histories March 15, 2012 It is an island of great ecological importance as it hosts the largest population of monk seal in the Mediterranean.  Mythology and early history  The pseudo-Aristotelian work On Marvellous Things Heard (25) recounts the tale that on Gyaros the mice eat iron. In the Aeneid of Virgil, Gyaros and Mykonos are said to be the two islands to which the god Apollo tied the holy island of Delos to stop its wandering over the Aegean Sea. : Amid the sea a land is worshiped, a land most sacred : to the mother of the Nereids and to Aegean Neptune, : which, the dutiful bow-bearing god bound from Myconos : and from steep Gyaros, as it wandered the shores and coasts, : and he made it immobile and to have contempt for the winds. : sacra mari colitur medio gratissima tellus : Nereidum matri et Neptuno Aegaeo, : quam pius arquitenens oras et litora circum : errantem Mycono e celsa Gyaroque reuinxit, : immotamque coli dedit et contemnere uentos. : Aeneid 3.73-77 In his recounting of the myth of the war between Minos and Aegeus, the king of Athens, the poet Ovid speaks of Gyaros as one island that refused to join the campaign of the Cretan king. : But Oliaros and Didyme and Tenos and Andros : and Gyaros and Peparethos (bountiful in gleaming olives) : did not assist the Knossian fleet; … : At non Oliaros Didymeque et Tenos et Andros : et Gyaros nitidaeque ferax Peparethos olivae : Cnosiacas iuvere rates; … : Metamorphoses 7.469-71 In 29 BC, the historian and geographer Strabo had an extended stay on the island, on his way to Corinth. In the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder wrote in his Natural History that the island, which had a city, was in circumference and lay from Andros.Gyara cum oppido, circuitu XV, abest ab Andro LXII, ab ea Syrnos LXXX (NH 4.69). These are Roman miles, but his geography is still considerably in error. He also records that the inhabitants of Gyaros were once put to flight by (a plague of) mice.ex Gyara Cycladum insula incolas a muribus fugatos (NH 8.104). The visitors of the island can see many small pieces of pottery on the ground mostly in the river bed of the northernmost and bigger mini valley where was the prisoners camp and its headquarters. No archaeological excavations have been conducted up to the year 2007. It is significant to note that there are remains of narrow terraces along the slopes of the eastern part of the island, proving that some rudimentary agriculture was driven in the past. Probably as back as the Prehistoric times used as refuge in times of raids by invading forces as well as the Roman times and later. The island is also mentioned by the Roman orator Cicero, and other notable Latin authors, indicating a broad awareness of Gyaros among the educated elite of the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD.Letters to Atticus 5.12.1  Exile island during the early Roman Empire  The island () also served as a place of exile during the early Roman Empire. Writing in the early 2nd century AD, the Roman historian Tacitus records that, when Silanus, the proconsul of the province of Asia, was accused of extortion and treason, and it had been proposed in the Roman Senate that he be exiled to Gyaros, the Roman Emperor Tiberius allowed him to be sent to the nearby island of Kythnos instead, since Gyaros was \\"harsh and devoid of human culture\\" (Annales 3.68-69).… addidit insulam Gyarum immitem et sine cultu hominum esse: In the Annales, Tiberius is portrayed as extraordinarily cruel and vengeful, making his hesitance to exile a criminal to Gyaros particularly pointed. When confronted with another recommendation to exile a defendant to Gyaros, Tiberius once more declined, noting that the island was deficient in water, and that those granted their lives ought to be granted the means to live (4.30). The defendant was allowed to go into exile on Amorgos instead.id quoque aspernatus est, egenam aquae utramque insulam referens dandosque vitae usus cui vita concederetur. Serenus, a son prosecuting his own father without justification, was accused of attempted parricide, and the Senate recommended the old punishment of being thrown unto the Tiber river sewn in a bag with a snake, a dog, a rooster, and a monkey. Tiberius vetoed that proposal, and the Senate next proposed exile to Gyaros as a suitably terrible punishment. The Roman poet Juvenal, a near-contemporary of Tacitus, mentions this island twice in his Satires: first as a place of exile for particularly vile criminals (1.73), and second as a symbol of claustrophobic imprisonment (10.170). In the second reference, Juvenal compares the restlessness of Alexander the Great to that of a man imprisoned: : One globe was not enough for the youth from Pella, : He seethed within the narrow confines of the world, : as if he were hemmed in by the cliffs of Gyara or by tiny Seriphos. : unus Pellaeo iuueni non sufficit orbis, : aestuat infelix angusto limite mundi : ut Gyarae clausus scopulis paruaque Seripho; : (1.168-70) Under emperor Nero, the philosopher Musonius Rufus was found guilty for his participation in the Pisonian conspiracy and was banished to Gyara.Tacitus, Annals, xv. 71; Cassius Dio, lxii. 27; Philostratus, Vit. Apoll., vii. 16  Exile island during the 20th century  There is a red brick prison building which during the years 1948 to 1953 held approximately 10,000 men in custody due to their participation in the Greek Resistance organization Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo (EAM). Many of them were also involved in the Greek civil war (1945–1949). Jehovah's Witnesses were also sentenced to exile there as Christian conscientious objectors. The prison was used again during the years 1957 to 1964 and during the Greek junta. The structures are decaying due to weathering, and no maintenance is conducted. In four separate places north of the prison building, there are also the ruins of the camps where the men lived in tents, both summer and winter. Once a year, the men and women who are alive and in good health (most of them were born between the 1910s and 1930s) who were formerly imprisoned on the island for their political views pay tribute by visiting the island and holding a ceremony in the cemetery of the men who left their last breath on this island. The Greek government used the island as a target range for the Hellenic Navy until the year 2000. Currently the island is off-limits to the general public and approaching or fishing in close proximity is forbidden by the coast guard.

They are a standard topic in mathematical logic textbooks such as and . Definition and example For the remainder of this article, assume that \\\\varphi_i is an admissible numbering of the computable functions and Wi the corresponding numbering of the recursively enumerable sets. A set A of natural numbers is called productive if there exists a total recursive (computable) function f so that for all i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, if W_i \\\\subseteq A then f(i) \\\\in A \\\\setminus W_i. The function f is called the productive function for A. A set A of natural numbers is called creative if A is recursively enumerable and its complement \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\setminus A is productive. Not every productive set has a recursively enumerable complement, however, as illustrated below. The archetypal creative set is K = \\\\\\\\{ i \\\\mid i \\\\in W_i \\\\\\\\}, the set representing the halting problem. Its complement \\\\bar{K} = \\\\\\\\{ i \\\\mid i ot \\\\in W_i \\\\\\\\} is productive with productive function f(i) = i (the identity function). To see this, we apply the definition of productivity function and show separately that i \\\\in \\\\bar{K} and i ot \\\\in W_i: * i \\\\in \\\\bar{K}: suppose i \\\\in K, then i \\\\in W_i, now given that W_i \\\\subseteq \\\\bar{K} we have i \\\\in \\\\bar{K}, this leads to a contradiction. So i \\\\in \\\\bar{K}. * i ot \\\\in W_i: in fact if i \\\\in W_i, then it would be true that i \\\\in K, but we have demonstrated the contrary in the previous point. So i ot \\\\in W_i.  Properties  No productive set A can be recursively enumerable, because whenever A contains every number in an r.e. set Wi it contains other numbers, and moreover there is an effective procedure to produce an example of such a number from the index i. Similarly, no creative set can be decidable, because this would imply that its complement, a productive set, is recursively enumerable. Any productive set has a productive function that is injective and total. The following theorems, due to Myhill (1955), show that in a sense all creative sets are like K and all productive sets are like \\\\bar{K}.; . Theorem. Let P be a set of natural numbers. The following are equivalent: *P is productive. *\\\\bar{K} is 1-reducible to P. *\\\\bar{K} is m-reducible to P. Theorem. Let C be a set of natural numbers. The following are equivalent: *C is creative. *C is 1-complete *C is recursively isomorphic to K, that is, there is a total computable bijection f on the natural numbers such that f(C) = K.  Applications in mathematical logic  The set of all provable sentences in an effective axiomatic system is always a recursively enumerable set. If the system is suitably complex, like first-order arithmetic, then the set T of Gödel numbers of true sentences in the system will be a productive set, which means that whenever W is a recursively enumerable set of true sentences, there is at least one true sentence that is not in W. This can be used to give a rigorous proof of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, because no recursively enumerable set is productive. The complement of the set T will not be recursively enumerable, and thus T is an example of a productive set whose complement is not creative.  History  The seminal paper of defined the concept he called a Creative set. Reiterating, the set K referenced above and defined as the domain of the function d(x)=x(x)+1 that takes the diagonal of all enumerated 1-place computable partial functions and adds 1 to them is an example of a creative set., pp. 79, 80, 120. Post gave a version of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem using his creative sets, where originally Gödel had in some sense constructed a sentence that could be freely translated as saying \\"I am unprovable in this axiomatic theory.\\" However, Gödel's proof did not work from the concept of true sentences, and rather used the concept of a consistent theory, which led to the Second incompleteness theorem. After Post completed his version of incompleteness he then added the following: \\"The conclusion is unescapable that even for such a fixed, well defined body of mathematical propositions, mathematical thinking is, and must remain, essentially creative.\\" The usual creative set K defined using the diagonal function d(x) has its own historical development. Alan Turing in a 1936 article on the Turing machine showed the existence of a universal computer that computes the \\\\Phi function. The function \\\\Phi is defined such that \\\\Phi(w,x) = (the result of applying the instructions coded by w to the input x ), and is universal in the sense that any calculable partial function f is given by f(x)= \\\\Phi(e,x) for all x where e codes the instructions for f. Using the above notation \\\\Phi(e,x)= e(x) , and the diagonal function arises quite naturally as d(x) = x(x)+1. Ultimately, these ideas are connected to Church's thesis that says the mathematical notion of computable partial functions is the correct formalization of an effectively calculable partial function, which can neither be proved or disproved. Church used Lambda calculus, Turing an idealized computer, and later Emil Post in his approach, all of which are equivalent. formulated an analogous concept, polynomial creativity, in computational complexity theory, and used it to provide potential counterexamples to the Berman–Hartmanis conjecture on isomorphism of NP-complete sets.

The name translates as \\"windstorm\\". She was sunk by the German submarine on 8 October 1943. There were 179 dead and 44 survivors. Description The M-class destroyers were repeats of the preceding L class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . The ships' complement was 190 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 169 The M class mounted six 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XI guns in twin-gun mounts, two superfiring in front of the bridge and one aft of the superstructure. The aft torpedo tubes were replaced by a single QF 4-inch Mk V anti-aircraft gun. Their light anti-aircraft suite was composed of one quadruple mount for 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" guns, two single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and two quadruple and two twin mounts for 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III anti- aircraft machinegun. Later in the war, single Oerlikons replaced the .50-calibre machineguns and, still later, twin Oerlikon mounts replaced four of the singles. The M-class ships completed with only one above-water quadruple mount for torpedoes, but the aft mount was later replaced and the 4-inch AA gun removed. The ships were equipped with two depth charge throwers, two racks and 42 depth charges. Construction and career She was built by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Govan, Scotland.

The group performed wearing classical musician's attire, white tie and tailcoat (not tuxedo).  History/biography  The band was formed by three Juilliard students Michael Kamen, Marty Fulterman (now known as Mark Snow) and Dorian Rudnytsky, plus two rock musicians Brian Corrigan and Clif Nivison. Rudnytsky said that while they were students at Juilliard, Kamen and Fulterman played in a rock band named \\"Emil & The Detectives\\" while he played in a rock band named Invicta with Corrigan and Nivison, all of whom hailed from Toms River, New Jersey. A mutual friend and record producer suggested that all five drop their current bands and form a new combo. After the new group's first gig at a Juilliard Halloween dance in 1967, they were signed by Atlantic Records where Ahmet Ertegün was quoted by one of the members as having said in jest, \\"You play all the right notes on all the wrong instruments.\\" Their recording debut was the 1968 eponymous album The New York Rock & Roll Ensemble, which broke the norm by using classical music instruments in rock songs and rock instruments in classical pieces. This fusion, daring at the time, impressed Leonard Bernstein who invited the group to appear at one of his Young People's Concerts with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, where they performed their signature song \\"Brandenburg\\", based on the first movement of Bach's Fifth Brandenburg Concerto. This track showed the group at their best, starting off as a straight rendition featuring two oboes, guitar and cello, then transitioning into a rock tune, while continuing to use Bach's musical foundation. Because Brandenburg was the song that showed the widest range of their musicianship, the group typically performed that song at television appearances on The Tonight Show, The Steve Allen Show and other TV shows of that era. Brandenburg appeared on the group's second album Faithful Friends, which had improved production since their first and contained many of the songs that were part of their live act. Their third album, Reflections, was recorded prior to Faithful Friends. It was a collaboration with Greek composer Manos Hatzidakis on a film score that was never produced. The group decided to release this already recorded music as their last Atlantic album. Because Reflections was such a departure from their \\"classical/rock\\" roots, it apparently sold poorly when released and at least one member of the group believed that it hurt their popularity by confusing their fan base. This album became the group's best selling album after it was re-released in Europe. In 2005 the Greek band Raining Pleasure released its own interpretation of this album. Rhythm guitarist Brian Corrigan departed after the third album, and the only movie appearance by the group in Zachariah which featured an extended version of Kamen's song \\"Gravedigger\\". The band then shortened its name to New York Rock Ensemble and switched to Columbia Records. Released in 1971, Roll Over was their most overtly rock style album and their biggest seller yet. The band's tour to support this album expanded on their usual college events, by playing with symphony orchestras across the country including the Boston Pops and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. During these gigs the group would play a solo set and then join with the orchestra to perform an orchestral version of Kamen's rock song \\"Anaconda,\\" and his \\"Winter Child\\", based on the Aria from Bach's Goldberg Variations. Kamen's orchestral composition and rock-orchestral fusion set the stage for his later work as a movie composer as well as a composer, conductor and performer with Metallica, Eric Clapton and Pink Floyd. Kamen also toured with David Bowie supporting the Diamond Dogs album. Their last album was Freedomburger in 1972. Soon after the tour supporting this album, the band dispersed. Kamen, joined by Rudnytsky and other musicians, gave it one last try when he released New York Rock in 1973. \\"Winter Child\\" appears on that album. Band membership at this time was Kamen and Rudnytsky, joined by David Sanborn on saxophone, Larry Packer (formerly of Cat Mother and the All Night News Boys) on guitar and violin, Dennis Whitted (later of Paul Butterfield and Bonnie Raitt) on drums and Hank DeVito (later of Emmylou Harris' \\"Hot Band\\") on pedal steel.See band particulars and promotional photo ; biography of Larry Packer at www.-hair-of-the-dog.com; 1971 date would appear to be in error. Michael Kamen later achieved fame for his many film scores and his \\"fusion\\" work. He died in 2003. Marty Fulterman adopted the name Mark Snow and gained renown for his scores and themes for TV shows, particularly The X Files.

The Act was created in response to the 1973 National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control report, America Burning. The report's authors estimated fires caused 12,000 deaths and 300,000 serious injuries annually in the United States, combined with annual property losses of $11.4 billion. Among its 90 recommendations, the report proposed that a federal agency be established to help combat the growing problem of fatal fires happening throughout the country. On April 11, 1975, President Gerald Ford announced his nomination of Ohio State Fire Marshal David A. Lucht to the new position of Deputy Administrator of the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration. On July 24, 1975, President Gerald Ford nominated Howard D.

The cutting edge of a glass knife is formed from a fracture line, and is extremely sharp. Glass knives were used in antiquity due to their natural sharpness and the ease with which they could be manufactured. In modern electron microscopy, glass knives are used to make the ultrathin sections needed for imaging. History An obsidian knife made before 5800 BCE Beginning in the Stone Age, glass knives (and other tools, such as arrowheads) were produced through a process known as knapping or lithic reduction. Although such bladed tools were often made of stone, naturally occurring glasses such as obsidian, natural volcanic glass, were also commonly used. From the 1920s through the 1940s, Dur-X glass fruit and cake knives were sold for use in kitchens under a 1938 US Patent.US Application Design 112059 S Before the wide availability of inexpensive stainless steel cutlery they were used for cutting citrus fruit, tomatoes, and other acidic foods, the flavor of which would be tainted by steel knives and which would stain ordinary steel knives. They were molded in tempered glass with ground edges.DUR-X GLASS FRUIT AND CAKE KNIFEBesteck – Knife Fork And Spoon Modern use Modern glass knives were once the blade of choice for the ultra-thin sectioning required in transmission electron microscopy because they can be manufactured by hand and are sharper than softer metal blades because the crystalline structure of metals makes it impossible to obtain a continuous sharp edge.Instruction for LKB 7800 The advent of diamond knives, which keep their edge much longer and are more suitable for cutting hard materials, quickly relegated glass knives to a second-rate status. However, some labs still use glass knives because they are significantly less expensive than diamond knives. A common practice is to use a glass knife to cut the block which contains the sample to near the location of the specimen to be examined. Then the glass knife is replaced by a diamond blade for the actual ultrathin sectioning. This extends the life of the diamond blade which is used only when its superior performance is critical. Obsidian, a naturally occurring volcanic glass, can also be used to make sharp glass knives; obsidian surgical scalpels are available commercially. All these blades are brittle and very easily broken if not used with care. Manufacture Glass knives can be produced by hand using pliers with two raised bumps on one jaw and a single bump between the two bumps on the opposing jaw, but special machines called \\"knife-makers\\" are used in most electron microscopy laboratories to ensure repeatable results. The glass used typically starts out as strips of plate glass, which is cut into squares. The glass square is then scored across the diagonal with a steel or tungsten carbide glass-cutting wheel to determine where the square will break, and pressure is then applied gradually across the opposite diagonal until the square breaks. This technique provides two usable knife edges, one on each of the two resulting triangles. The better the break is aligned with the diagonal, the better the cutting edge. In popular culture * Glass knives are the weapon of choice of the antagonist Dmitri \\"Raven\\" Ravinoff in the novel Snow Crash because they are undetectable by security systems and are said in the book to be molecule-thin at the edges, sharp enough to penetrate bulletproof vests. * Glass knives are the weapon of choice for most Mistborn in Brandon Sanderson's fantasy novel series of the same name (Mistborn), due to the lack of metal that other Allomancers would be able to Push or Pull on. * Glass weapons are usable by either the protagonist or enemies in The Elder Scrolls series of video games. The weapons are depicted as having a green, semi-transparent color and are generally end-game equipment, having higher statistics than most weapons.

The techniques vary in their precise tenets but generally share principles of \\"a kinder and gentler cowboy\\" to develop a rapport with horses, using methods said to be derived from observation of the natural behavior of free-roaming horses and rejecting abusive training methods. Natural horsemanship practitioners often describe their principles with evangelical zeal, describing the approach as being a radical departure from \\"traditional\\" techniques, which are often portrayed as being based in the use of unnecessary force. Users and practitioners tend to relate benefits both in relation to the quasi-scientific narrative of the ethology of horse behavior, viewing the horse as \\"other\\", but also to the idea of an anthropomorphic partnership. High-profile practitioners of natural horsemanship such as Monty Roberts and Pat Parelli market their methods and equipment extensively through books, television appearances, live shows and other media. The natural horsemanship movement is controversial in the mainstream equestrian community, with criticism leveled at practitioners on a number of levels, while natural horsemanship advocates in turn are highly critical of more traditional methods. Natural horsemanship promoters face criticism that their techniques are not \\"new\\" and are classical concepts that are simply renamed or repackaged in order to be able to sell products and merchandise. History The idea of working in sympathy with a horse in order to obtain cooperation is not new, with documented instances as far back as the two part treatise On Horsemanship by Xenophon (c. 430 – 354 BCE), which amongst other points, emphasized operant conditioning and emphasized reassurance over punishment. Later classical dressage practitioners such as Antoine de Pluvinel (1555–1620 CE) and François Robichon de La Guérinière (1688–1751) also emphasized gentle techniques. However, gentle training methods have always had to compete with harsher methods, which often appear to obtain faster, but less predictable results. In particular, the cowboy tradition of the American west, where the economics of needing to break large numbers of semi-feral horses in a short period of time led to the development of a number of harsh training methods that the natural horsemanship movement specifically has set out to replace. The modern natural horsemanship movement, though not originally described as such, developed primarily in the United States Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain states, where the \\"buckaroo\\" or vaquero-style cowboy tradition was the strongest. Brothers Tom and Bill Dorrance were early modern practitioners, who had background in the Great Basin buckaroo tradition. They had a particularly strong influence on Ray Hunt, who in turn became a significant influence upon Buck Brannaman. Many practitioners claim influence from the Dorrance brothers and Hunt, some having trained directly with these individuals. Other practitioners, such as Pat Parelli, came from the rodeo world. In Europe a number of variations are practiced that developed independently of the American model, influenced by Spanish or Hungarian horsemanship traditions as well as the teachings of Classical dressage. Some include work rooted in the use of human body language to communicate effectively to the horse.Hempfling, Klaus Ferdinand. Dancing With Horses The growth in the modern acceptance of the techniques (and the growth in marketing of them) has been increasing since the 1970s, with initial slow growth accelerating through the 1980s and 1990s. Nomenclature The term \\"horse whispering\\" dates to nineteenth century Europe when an Irish horseman, Daniel \\"Horse-Whisperer\\" Sullivan (d. 1810), made a name for himself in England by rehabilitating horses that had become vicious and intractable due to abuse or accidental trauma.Tachyhippodamia, Willis J. Powell, p. iv John Solomon Rarey, a nineteenth century American trainer, was summoned to Windsor Castle in 1852 by Queen Victoria to demonstrate his Rarey technique on her wildest horses.New York Daily Tribune, January 7, 1861, p. 3. Some natural horsemanship practitioners do not use the term \\"horse whisperer\\" to describe themselves, and some horse trainers dislike the \\"horse whispering\\" moniker to the extent that they openly ask that the term not be applied to them. \\"Natural horsemanship\\" is a more recent term, originating in the western United States, and not coming into popular use until around 1985. Its origin is widely attributed within the movement to Pat Parelli, who wrote a book using the phrase in the title.Miller, p. 36 The term became linked to \\"horse whispering\\" in the 1990s, when the popularity of Nicholas Evans' book The Horse Whisperer, and the later Robert Redford film of the same name, promoted popular awareness of natural horsemanship. However, some trainers linked to the movement, such as Mark Rashid and Tom Moates, have stated their discomfort with the term \\"natural horsemanship.\\" The movement has led many people in the horse industry to question \\"traditional\\" practices and to look at learning theory and equitation science to better understand horse behavior. Within the Natural Horsemanship movement, the phrases \\"traditional\\" or \\"traditional methods\\" generally refer to brutal methods of horse-breaking that trained horses by dominating the horse and breaking its spirit. Some of these techniques are attributable to simple human failings such as ignorance or machismo. Others were derived from certain types of military training that insisted upon complete submission and learned helplessness from the horse, with misbehavior attributed to deliberate acts by the horse instead of a reaction to pain or fear of the handler. Still others were attributed to equipment and methods used on rodeo horses in the speed events such as calf roping and barrel racing. However, practitioners of classic, time-honored, humane training methods take issue with the characterization of \\"traditional\\" methods of training as \\"inhumane\\", noting that gentle techniques have always existed. Some natural horsemanship advocates acknowledge that there are \\"traditional\\" techniques that can be used in a humane manner, even suggesting that multiple styles can be used together in a complementary fashion.  Common theories  Techniques and precise theories vary between practitioners of natural horsemanship, but the central theme is that they advocate training and handling techniques which they claim are kind and gentle. Part of the premise of natural horsemanship is that teaching through pain and fear does not result in the type of relationship that benefits both horse and handler. Like almost all horse training, the principal teaching aid is the use of operant conditioning to reinforce desired behaviours. The most common conditioning method is the use of pressure and release, with physical pressure being applied until the horse complies, or tries to comply, at which point the pressure is released as a negative reinforcement to the action. Punishment by physical force is rarely used in natural horsemanship, and many practitioners caution against the misuse of aids such as whips. Many techniques focus on the extensive use of ground handling to build rapport and mutual understanding with the horse. Methods include the use of leading and suppling exercises, and training the horse on the longe line or loose in a round pen. Most natural horsemanship practitioners advocate use of a type of rope halter that has a thinner noseband and heavy heel knot reminiscent of a bosal style hackamore for groundwork, and, for some, riding. Usually use of a lead rope is promoted, which doubles as a lead line and a short longe line. Some, though not all, practitioners work horses bridleless, or consider bridleless work to represent the culmination of their training. Once a horse is under saddle, most practitioners advocate use of either a loose-ring or a full cheek style snaffle bit, and rope reins that include slobber straps and a lead rope section on the left side characteristic of a hackamore's mecate, sometimes called a \\"McCarty outfit.\\" All practitioners emphasize that communication should be possible through light or minimal rein contact with the horse's mouth, encouraging primary use of weight and leg aids. Natural horsemanship and riding disciplines that emphasize steady, light contact are not incompatible, however. One practitioner has suggested that use of a patented design of bitless bridle can create more effective control of the horse, and solve other problems related to bitting. However, the benefits of a bitless bridle have been questioned in light of recent studies showing that the cross- under design puts significant pressure on the poll and under the chin, while soft tissues such as the tongue are actually better suited to handling pressure from a rider's hands than hard tissues like the nose bone and the palate, though bitless designs may still be suitable for horses with mouth injuries. Efficacy A 2009 small-scale study of the efficacy of natural horsemanship techniques compared to \\"traditional\\" exercises indicated that natural horsemanship exercises could be more efficient at improving the human–horse relationship and reduce stress on the horse during training without compromising technical performance. A 2012 study, however, questioned some types of round pen training on the grounds that pressure-release methods do not enhance horse-human interaction (as remote-controlled cars were used to elicit similar responses) but actually control the horse through fear and for that reason may be less humane than originally thought.  Criticism  The natural horsemanship movement has been criticized from a number of angles. The first criticism is that claims of natural horsemanship being something new and different are wholly unfounded, that similar methods have been around for a very long time. Some practitioners, particularly in classical dressage and other English riding disciplines, consider much of the movement to simply be the application of humane methods of classical horsemanship that have been practiced for centuries. However, many natural horsemanship practitioners acknowledge that they did not invent natural horsemanship and credit earlier work in humane horse-handling techniques. Another common concern is that the movement has been promoted with too much hype and marketing. In particular, there are concerns that stories of near-miraculous results can mislead beginners to believe that they can accomplish miracles with their horses with little effort, education, or experience in horse training. A related concern is that practitioners rename common pieces of horse equipment and then sell their branded versions for premium prices. Some trainers view the use of particular brands or styles of common equipment as having more to do with personal preference than anything else. Others view certain tools as unneeded or prone to misuse. Practitioners counter that the equipment that they sell, such as rigid sticks and yachting-braid rope, have distinct characteristics that lend themselves to natural horsemanship training. In particular, the characterization of \\"traditional\\" methods of training as \\"inhumane\\" does not accurately describe classic, time-honored, humane training methods. Though some critics acknowledge that some historical techniques were not always gentle, they point out that gentle techniques have always existed as well. Others express concern that natural horsemanship fails as a complete method of horse training. Other trainers point out that the very act of catching and training horses is not \\"natural\\" at all, that everything people do with horses is not actually \\"natural\\" to the horse. Other authors such as Lawrence Scanlan suggest that \\"Domestication [of the horse] was a natural consequence... for those.. who were more curious, less territorial, less aggressive, more dependent [and] better able to deflect human aggression through submission\\". Overuse of negative reinforcement in any training method to increase rates of desired behaviors can produce anxiety and stress in the horse until the aversive stimulus or \\"pressure\\" is released.Sidman, M. (2001) Coercion and its fallout Boston: Authors Cooperative Failure of the horse to emit the desired behavior, or failure of the trainer to relieve the pressure after a correct performance, will only prolong this stress.

A figure on the right, an O'Cahan, can be seen holding a shoe over the chief's head as part of the \\"single shoe\\" ritual Tullyhogue Fort, also spelt TullaghogeDiscover Northern Ireland: Tullaghoge Fort or TullahogeCookstown District Council minutes (8 April 2008) The Development of the Irish Language: Part 5, Culture Northern Ireland (from Middle Irish Tulach Óc meaning \\"hill of youth\\" or \\"mound of the young warriors\\"), is large mound on the outskirts of Tullyhogue village near Cookstown, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It has a depressed centre and is surrounded by trees. It is an ancient ceremonial site where the Chiefs of the Clan O'Neill of Tyrone were inaugurated. It is a State Care Historic Monument sited in the townland of Ballymully Glebe, in the Cookstown District Council area, at grid reference: H8250 7430. The inauguration site is a Scheduled Historic Monument at grid ref: H8251 7428. History The date of the construction of Tullyhogue fort is not known; however, it is believed to have held great significance from early times, possessing a form of ritual importance long before the O'Neills became associated with the site. Tullyhogue ráth was originally associated with the Uí Tuirtri of Airgialla who were displaced by branches of the Cenél nEógain. The first to enter the area in the tenth-century were the Cenél mBinnig who are described in their genealogies in the twelfth-century manuscript Rawlinson B 502 as of 'Tilcha Oc'. Over time they moved north into Glenconkeyne and Loughinsholin and were replaced by the Cenél Feargusa who included the O'Hagans, supporters of the O'Neill dynasty interest. Before 1056 they took possession of the site as 'reachtaire' (steward or controller of the royal household) which they continued to occupy down to the 17th century.Connolly, S. J., Oxford Companion to Irish History, page 584-5. Oxford University Press, 2007.At this time the Cenél nEógain had been largely bereft of effective leadership candidates and the branches in the Tulach Óc district made the unusual political decision to import an alien dynasty; Conchobar and his brother Cennétig, grandsons of Donnchadh mac Briain, bitter rivals to the main branch of the royal Munster O'Brien dynasty. They became successive 'Kings of Telach Óc' for a short period before 1084 with the support of the Meic Lochlainn who were happy to deprive potential internal rivals of a secure base of operation.Hogan, James, 'The Ua Briain kingship of Telach Oc' in John Ryan (ed), Feilsgribhinn Eoin Mhic Neill, pages 406-44, At the Sign of the Three Candle, 1940. The Ua Briain branch was unable to establish itself permanently but the disruption allowed Domnall Ua Lochlainn, son-in-law to Cennétig, to become King of Ailech in 1083 and the threat of Ó Néill rivals disappeared for a number of generations. The O'Hagans continued to dwell at the site and became its hereditary guardians, with their burial place at Donaghrisk situated at the bottom of the hill. In the later medieval period it became the inauguration site of the O'Neill dynasty, where the title An Ó Néill ('The O'Neill') was bestowed upon each new lord. The inauguration was carried out by the heads of the O'Cahan and O'Hagan. O'Cahan, the O'Neill's principal sub-chief, would throw a golden sandal over the new lord's head to signify good fortune. O'Hagan, being the hereditary guardian of Tullyhogue, would place the shoe on the O'Neill's foot and present him with a rod of office. The 2nd Earl of Tyrone's inauguration in 1595 was the last such event for an O'Neill to take place at Tullyhogue. The last inauguration that is claimed to have taken place at Tullyhogue was that of Sir Phelim O'Neill in 1641; however, it was later rejected. =Leac na Rí= The inauguration stone was a large boulder known as the Leac na Rí, which meant 'the flagstone of the kings'. It stood outside Tullyhogue fort where, by the 16th century, it had become incorporated into a ceremonial stone chair where three large slabs had been placed around it. In 1602 during the Nine Years War, Lord Mountjoy, in charge of the English forces at war with Lord Tyrone, smashed the inauguration stone to symbolically end the O'Neill's sovereignty. The Leac na Rí is stated as being the Ulster counterpart to the Stone of Destiny, which is now kept at Edinburgh Castle and is used as part of the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey during the Coronation of the British monarch. The Leac na Rí is also stated as reputedly having been blessed by St. Patrick. Features The initial impression of Tullyhogue fort is that it resembled an early Christian bivallate rath which was an enclosed homestead surrounded by two banks and ditches. Tullyhogue matches this description in that it has an enclosure 105 ft in diameter that is encircled by two banks. Entry to it was by a causeway in the inner bank. What makes it clear that it was not an enclosed homestead is that the two ditches were built wide apart with a flat area in between, with no outer defensive ditch. The layout of the fort itself shows that it was not built or designed as a defensive structure, but as an area of ceremonial importance. Today Cookstown District Council have initiated a tourism plan for visitors and Tullyhogue Fort has become part of its marketing agenda due to its history. During the summer it is a popular tourist destination. In 1998, Don Carlos O'Neill, a Spanish descendant of Hugh O'Neill, started an annual event that takes place in August each year whereby he and his family commemorate the inauguration ceremony of the O'Neills on the spot where his predecessors were crowned. In February 2007 Cookstown District Council confirmed that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) had agreed to sell the land required to develop Tullyhogue Fort to Council for £90,000.

She lived with her mother in the Armenian SSR until age 10, when she went to live with her father in Warsaw, Poland. In 1967, her mother married an American and moved to Buffalo, New York. Hoffman joined them in the United States in 1968.Joanna Hoffman Interview at Makers Conference 2016 accessed 2-7-2015 Hoffman quickly became fluent in English and excelled in school. She has a background in anthropology, physics, and linguistics, a Bachelor of Science in Humanities and Science from MIT, and pursued a doctorate (which she did not complete) in archaeology at the University of Chicago at the Oriental Institute. In 1979, she was scheduled to travel to Iran for an archaeology dig. She stopped in Poland to visit her grandmother and received word from Iran that she would have to return to the United States because of the Iranian Revolution. Career Hoffman was on a leave of absence from the University of Chicago when she was encouraged by her friends to attend a lecture at Xerox PARC in California. While there, she had \\"a heated discussion after the lecture\\" with Jef Raskin. The discussion focused on \\"what computers should look like and how they should improve people's lives.\\" Raskin was so impressed with Hoffman that he asked her to interview for a position at Apple. She began on the Macintosh project in October 1980 as part of Raskin's initial team of Burrell Smith, Bud Tribble, and Brian Howard. At the time she began, the Mac was \\"still a research project\\" Her position \\"constituted the entire Macintosh marketing team for the first year and a half of the project.\\" She also wrote the \\"first draft of the Macintosh User Interface Guidelines.\\" Hoffman would eventually run the International Marketing Team which brought the Mac to Europe and Asia. She later followed Steve Jobs to NeXT, as one of its original members. Hoffman had a reputation at both Apple and NeXT as one of the few who could successfully engage with Jobs. In both 1981 and 1982, she won a satirical award at Apple given to \\"the person who did the best job of standing up to Jobs”. (Jobs was aware of the award and liked it.) During the early 1990s, Hoffman was vice president of Marketing at General Magic, retiring in 1995 to spend more time with her family. On occasion she has given public lectures discussing her early life at Apple and working with Steve Jobs. In 2020 she was hired by the Spanish artificial intelligence company Sherpa as a consultant and the right-hand of its founder and CEO Xabi Uribe Etxebarria. Personal life Hoffman is married to Alain Rossmann, a native of France, who also worked on the Mac team at Apple, with whom she has two sons. Her children attended the International School of the Peninsula in Palo Alto, where she served on the school board.Hoffman Conversation accessed 1-27-2016 Portrayal in media Abigail McConnell portrayed Hoffman in the 2013 film Jobs.

The club has been in existence since 1905 and has changed in both structure and purpose, mostly due to severe damage caused by several fires. History The Phoenix Theater first opened in 1905 as the Hill Opera House, a small town opera house. In the early 1920s, it was nearly destroyed by a fire forcing the theater to be shut down. By 1925, it had been restored and opened as a movie theater. The building was purchased by California Movie Theater around 1935 and renamed California Theater. On August 5, 1957, another fire took the roof of the building. The building was restored and renamed the Showcase Theater by the Tocchini family and soon after the first live concert was put on at the theater by Petaluma native Jeff Dorenfeld. The Tocchinis employed a boy named Tom Gaffey, who managed to be rehired by Ken Frankel after Frankel bought the theater in 1982. Gaffey was then named theater manager and he renamed the theater after the mythological phoenix because the building seemed to ‘rise from the ashes’. The Theater gained unwanted attention after a late-night performance by the band Popsicle Love Sponge performed a questionable act with the body of what was believed to be a dead chicken. The late night shows ended, but the movies continued for a short time. In 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake caused moderate damage to the theaters interior resulting in a long-awaited renovations. In the late 1990s, its landlord announced plans to sell the Phoenix Theater for demolition and reconstruction as an office building, despite public opposition. The sale was in escrow when four employees from Cerent Corporation, who were all musicians and two of whom were former Phoenix Theater frequenters, intervened and took over the escrow. With other leading local citizens, they established the non-profit Petaluma Phoenix Center, Inc., to not only own The Phoenix Theater, but preserve and expand the services the Phoenix provides to its community. Many famous rock bands and performers have played The Phoenix Theatre on their way to stardom including The Ramones, Green Day, Arcade Fire, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Primus, Sublime, and Pennywise. Bradley Nowell, original lead singer of Sublime, played his last show with Sublime at The Phoenix Theatre on May 24, 1996. The next morning he was found dead of a heroin overdose in his room at a San Francisco hotel. Neutral Milk Hotel played their last concert here in 2015.

Like many similar magazines, it contained sections of news, game reviews, previews, tips, help guides, columnists, reader's letters, and occasionally cover-mounted game demos. When the magazine was relaunched, it was directly competing with Computer and Video Games but with only a fifth of the 100,000 monthly sales. It battled on for two years but, adding only 6,000 sales, it was eventually closed in 1987. Although lost in the crowd of titles on the market in the mid-80s, Gamer did achieve the distinction of having an issue banned by W H Smith and other UK newsagents. The cover promoted a game called \\"Blood And Guts\\" but was considered to be too gory and was replaced by a plainer rush cover.

Heta formed on December 25, 2003; it reached a maximum intensity of 260 km/h (160 mph) and an estimated pressure of 915 hPa (27.02 inHg) before dissipating on January 11, 2004. It was the first tropical cyclone to form in the area of responsibility of the regional specialised meteorological centre (RSMC) at Nadi, Fiji, during the 2003–04 South Pacific cyclone season. The damage Heta caused on Tonga, Niue, and American Samoa was estimated at $150 million (2004 USD), with most of the damage occurring in American Samoa; the cyclone was also responsible for one death. Heta precipitated a massive relief and clean-up operation that lasted throughout 2004. Meteorological history During December 25, 2003 the Fiji Meteorological Service reported that Tropical Disturbance 03F had developed underneath the subtropical ridge of high pressure about halfway between Fiji and Rotuma. At this time, the disturbance was poorly organised with atmospheric convection surrounding the system displaced by about a degree to the north and east of its low-level circulation centre. Over the next few days, the system gradually developed further and was classified as a tropical depression by the FMS during December 28, as it slowly moved eastwards to the north of Fiji. During the next day, as the depression passed about to the northeast of Futuna, the system started to move north-eastwards towards Tokelau. The depression migrated first northward and then eastward until January 2, 2004, when it reached tropical storm strength and was named Heta. At this point, low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures caused Heta to intensify rapidly.Unisys (2006)Unisys Best Track Data URL Accessed: August 17, 2006Padget, Gary Cyclone Heta Report Australian Severe Weather.

The center of Heta passed west of Samoa as the storm reached Category 2 status. Heta reached a peak intensity of 260 km/h (160 mph) at midnight UTC on January 5, and maintained it for 24 hours as it continued its south-southeastward track. Heta passed close to the island of Niue at 03:00 UTC January 6 as it began slowly weakening. By January 7, Cyclone Heta had exited the Nadi RMSC's area of responsibility and entered that of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center at Wellington, New Zealand. The storm slowly weakened as it encountered the cooler waters of the far South Pacific. Heta became extratropical 845 km (525 mi) south of the island of Rarotonga later on the 7th. These remnants of Heta slowed even further and moved westward, where they finally dissipated on January 11 east of Norfolk Island. Effects =Tokelau= During January 1, the FMS issued a tropical cyclone alert for Tokelau before upgrading it later that day to a gale warning, as Heta was expected to cause gale-force winds over the islands within 24–36 hours. The warning was kept in force over the next 48 hours before it was cancelled during January 3, after Heta had moved away from Tokelau. =Wallis and Futuna= =Samoan Islands= In Samoa and American Samoa, although hurricane warnings were in effect, there were no reports of evacuations or storm shelters being opened before the storm.AFAP (2004) AP Warning #6 APCEDI URL Accessed: August 18, 2006 =Tonga= =Niue= In Niue, anticipating that the storm would bring catastrophic damage, 1300 residents sought shelter in their homes while others evacuated coastal areas to higher ground.

The church structure was built around the 9th century by the Aksumite king Dil Na'odTaddesse Tamrat, Church and State in Ethiopia (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 36.. In the 13th century the church was converted into a monastery in large part due to the work of Saint Iyasus Mo'a & later Emperor Yekuno Amlak.Taddesse Tamrat, pp. 66-7. History The monastery is responsible for producing five people, known as \\"Lights\\" (or important sources of knowledge and Christian salvation) of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. One of these Lights was Saint Tekle Haymanot, who was educated in this monastery, and helped to convert Shewa and other southern provinces by ministering and building churches. Istifanos Monastery was looted by Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi in 1531, who, upon coming upon the lake ordered the Arabs in his ranks to construct boats to reach the island. The first boats constructed, which were made out of wood beams bounded by cords, proved unsatisfactory; one of the Imam's followers suggested tying air sacs made of cow's skins to each raft, and this allowed the Imam's forces to sail across the lake to the monastery. Seeing that they were now defenseless, the monks of the monastery surrendered their valuables to prevent the destruction of their home.Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, Futuh al-Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia, translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), pp. 266-273; The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles, ed.

The earliest trilobites in the fossil record are arguably Olenellina, although the earliest Redlichiina and Eodiscina follow quickly.http://www.trilobites.info/firsttrilos.htm The suborder died out when the Lower passed into the Middle Cambrian, at the end of the stage called Toyonian. A feature uniting the Olenellina is the lack of rupture lines (or sutures) in the headshield, which in other trilobites assist the periodic moulting (or ecdysis), associated with arthropod growth. Some derived trilobites have lost facial sutures again (some Eodiscina, all Agnostina, and a few Phacopina), but all of these are blind, while all Olenellina have eyes.  Taxonomy  The suborder contains four superfamilies: Olenelloidea (with 3 families and 5 stemgroup genera), Judomioidea (with 1 family and 3 stemgroup genera), Nevadioidea, and Fallotaspidoidea (with 3 families and 3 stemgroup genera). Lieberman, 2002, considered that the Fallotaspidoidea are a paraphyletic group because it gave rise to the Redlichiina; he did not propose to restrict the Olenellina to the Olenelloidea, Judomioidea and Nevadioidea. Neither did he propose to assign this group of superfamilies to a newly formed order Olenellida, and consequently expand the Redlichiina to include the Fallotaspidoidea. This would imply that the Redlichiina would include taxa with and without dorsal sutures.  Distribution  The Olenellina appear suddenly at the start of the Cambrian Series 2 (between Stage 2 Tommotian and Stage 3 Atdabanian) approximately million years ago, and disappear at the end of this Series (between Stage 4 Toyonian and Stage 5 Amgan), to million years ago. The Olenellina probably first occurred on the paleocontinent Siberia and spread into the part of Gondwana that is now the Atlas Mountains, Baltica, Avalonia and Laurentia. In western Laurentia the first representatives to appear are Fallotaspididae, followed by Archaeaspididae, Nevadioidea and Holmiidae, and finally Biceratopsidae and Olenellidae. The Olenellina are not known from South China, Australia and most of Latin America and Africa, where the first trilobites were Redlichiina, that had already developed dorsal sutures.  Description  As with most early trilobites, the Olenellina have an almost flat exoskeleton, that is only thinly calcified, and have crescent- shaped eye ridges. The suborder differs from all other trilobites by the lack of dorsal sutures in the head shield (or cephalon). There is a ventral mouth plate (or conterminant hypostome) with a very wide rostral plate extending between genal angles, with a perrostral suture (no connective sutures). The thorax may be composed of a prothorax that generally has 14 or 15 segments, and an opisthothorax that has between 0 and up to 34 segments. In segment 3, the areas right and left of the axis (or pleural lobes) are often enlarged, sometimes carrying large trailing pleural spines. Segment 14 or 15 is often bearing a large spine at midline that points backwards. The pygidium is mostly very small with few segments, that are often difficult to discern. Unlike in other trilobite groups, the early larval stage called protaspid is not known, and it is generally accepted that this is because the protaspid was not calcified.

He first worked as a mathematics teacher, and philosopher, but switched to psychology when he was 33. He spent most of his career at the University of Washington, where he became full professor and then emeritus professor in psychology. Guthrie is best known for his theory that all learning was based on a stimulus–response association. This was variously described as one trial theory, non- reinforcement, and contiguity learning. The theory was: :\\"A combination of stimuli which has accompanied a movement will on its recurrence tend to be followed by that movement\\".Guthrie E.R. 1935. The psychology of learning. New York: Harper & Row, p26. One word that his coworkers and students used to describe Guthrie and his theories was \\"simple\\",Sheffield F.D. 1959. Edwin Ray Guthrie: 1886-1959. American Journal of Psychology, 642-650. and perhaps he did prefer to use simple terms to illustrate complex ideas. However, \\"It is undoubtedly true that many reviews of Guthrie in the literature have mistaken incompleteness for simplicity\\".Mueller C.G. Jr & Schonfeld W.N. 1954. Edwin R. Guthrie. In W.E. Estes et al, Modern learning theory. New York: Appleton- Century-Crofts, 345379. His simple nature carried into his teachings where he took great pride in working with and teaching students.  Early life and education  Guthrie was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, to a father who owned a store selling pianos and bicycles, and a mother who was a school teacher. He remarked that his theories got an early start when he and a friend read Darwin's Origin of Species and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals while they were both in eighth grade. Guthrie graduated at the age of 17 after writing a rather inflammatory senior thesis that argued \\"that both science and religion, being dependent on words, and words being symbols dependent for their meanings on the experience of their users and auditors, would have no chance at expressing Absolute Truth\\".Guthrie, Edwin, Association by contiguity. In Sigmund Koch (ed), 1959. Psychology: a study of a science, 158-198. Guthrie received the title of lay reader in his local Episcopal Church while pursuing a philosophy degree from the University of Nebraska. This university he credited with helping him pursue his varied interests because \\"the university had none of the present apparatus of required courses and set curricula. . . . This freedom made possible the inclusion of courses in both Latin and Greek which had been begun in high school; mathematics through calculus\\" =Psychology interest= While Guthrie was going to graduate school he was the only student in a seminary taught by Wilhelm Wundt’s protégé H. K. Wolfe, where they debated the philosophy of science. Guthrie later characterized the classes that he took for his degree as philosophy courses that \\"took much interest in issues that would now be recognized as psychological\\". His focus upon a theoretical approach to psychology as opposed to an experimental research approach can be found in his account of his single experimental psychology course which he described as \\"a research course under Bolton devoted a winter to observations with an aesthesiometer on the limen of twoness, and served to quench [my] interest in psychophysics, which was the chief preoccupation of psychological laboratories in those times\\". His professional psychology career did not start in full until he met Stevenson Smith, who founded the psychology department at the University of Washington in 1917. Guthrie and Smith helped write Chapters in General Psychology in 1921. This book and work with Smith, focused Guthrie's continuing psychological works towards how exactly learning works and what affects a person's capability of learning. He and his wife, Helen MacDonald, traveled to France where they met Pierre Janet. Janet's writing had a great impact on Guthrie's thinking, so profound in fact that Guthrie and his wife translated Janet's Principles of Psychology together. Guthrie added to Janet's writings an objective theory of learning.Edwin Ray Guthrie, Encyclopedia of Psychology 2001 One trial theory Guthrie's theories went against those of Watson’s classical conditioning and Skinner’s operant conditioning due mainly to Guthrie’s insistence that their \\"desire for results of immediate practical applications\\" led to their theories being wrong.Guthrie, E. R. (1946). Psychological Facts and Psychological Theory., \\"Psychological Bulletin\\" Vol. 43, 1-20 Guthrie's learning theory is called one-trial learning and he developed it with Smith at the University of Washington.Smith, S. & Guthrie, E. Exhibitionism, University of Washington, 1920, 205-211 Guthrie and Smith's theory states that all learning is done within a single exposure to a situation. Guthrie admitted that his own theory required the assumption that people react to a given situation the same way so long as it was still effective. Guthrie's more ambiguous theories and assumptions were put into more understandable terms after his death. These notes focused upon the following three principles, the principle of association, the principle of postremity, and the principle of response probability.Voeks, V. W. Formalization and clarification of a learning of theory, Journal of Psychology 1950, Vol. 30, 341-362 * The principle of association says that any stimulus that accompanies a behavior or immediately precedes it by less than half a second becomes a cue for that specific behavior. * The principle of postremity theorizes that a stimulus when followed by more than two responses only becomes associated with the response closest to the stimulus. * The principle of response probability states that the chance of a particular response occurring at a specified time relates to the size of the stimulus for that response present at the specified time. The more cues for a stimulus the higher the chance of a desired response. =Punishment= Guthrie also had theories as to how punishment worked that were at odds with the likes of Thorndike and other learning theorists of his own time. Guthrie thought that punishment was only as effective as the amount of change in behavior the punishment caused.Guthrie, E. R. Reward and Punishment, Psychological Review 1934, Vol. 41, 450-460 Guthrie's theory required that presentation of punishment happen while the stimulus is still around. He did warn that if the punishment did not stop the undesirable response or if it was not presented in the presence of the stimulus that the punishment could actually strengthen the undesired response. =Breaking habits= Guthrie believed that dozens of tiny movements make up what most see as a single behavior; much like waving good- bye actually involves dozens of muscle movements. Guthrie viewed habits as a response connecting with a large number of stimuli, which causes the habit to happen more often to a wide variety of things. He postulated that there were three different ways to break a habit, the threshold method, the fatigue method, and the incompatible response method. * The threshold method involves introducing stimuli that are associated with the habit response at such a weak level that it doesn't actually elicit the response. The strength of the stimuli is increased slowly until the stimuli can be presented at full strength without eliciting the habit response. Guthrie compared this method to \\"horse whispering.\\" * The fatigue method is quite simple, you keep presenting the stimulus until the person with the habit no longer replies with their habitual response. Guthrie considered this method similar to \\"breaking the horse.\\" * The incompatible response method pairs the stimuli that causes the habitual behavior with another stimulus that triggers a response that is opposite or incompatible with the habit that you want to get rid of. Historical relevance According to his students, Guthrie's writings and theories were intentionally vague and \\"ambiguous\\" much to his insistence on his work not being biased in a similar fashion and due to this resulted in most of his theories not being tested while Guthrie was alive.Cech, C. G. Chapter 5 - The Nature of Reinforcement & Its effects on Acquisition: Guthrie’s Contiguity Theory 1998 Thankfully, his peers and students turned his theories into more precise ideas that allowed experiments to test them. His theories on learning were wrong but his ideas about behaviorism helped make the case that Psychology as a whole had important applications to real life issues. His real effect on the course of Psychology however, came from those he left behind. His student Voeks was the one who formalized Guthrie's theories into a more testable form and his colleague William Kaye Estes took Guthrie's ideas and created a statistical theory of learning that he is now famous for.  Guthrie on education  Edwin Ray Guthrie was interested in the application of psychology and his learning theories in education. In the preface of his book Educational Psychology (1950), he states, \\" … the ultimate test of a theory of learning is its influence on the all-round growth of young people when applied in the classroom.\\" He hypothesized that pairing a stimulus and response could result in learning after only one trial. Guthrie believed that learning takes place through association and conditioning, and one pairing is often enough to establish a connection, rather than repeated stimulus-response pairings. These association and connectionist theories are the bases of Guthrie's contiguity theory of learning. The law of contiguity refers to associating, or learning, two stimuli or events that occur simultaneously. When the stimulus and response occur together, they are learned due to the connection of their contiguity. Guthrie acknowledged the use of reinforcement and rewards, but he did not deem them necessary for learning. He believed that organisms played a large part in their learning when developing habits and skills due to \\"movement-produced stimuli.\\" Therefore, he asserts that the students do not learn from what the teacher does, but from what they do themselves. In other words, students do not learn something merely by hearing or reading it; rather, the information must elicit an \\"active response\\" in the learner. He believed that the ideal school environment is one that permits \\"freedom of responsible action.\\" He advocated for an environment that does not repress individual differences but rather appreciates them and allows the students as much self-direction as possible. Guthrie described that an effective teacher would be one that would modify and revise the content of their lessons because students are dynamic in their learning and are \\"constantly organizing and reorganizing experiences.\\" According to Visible Learning for Teachers (2012), which evaluates effective teaching strategies, Hattie makes a significant point to advocate for flexible, adaptable instruction that is modified by the students’ prior knowledge, experiences, and individual differences as well as their rates of learning. The applications of Guthrie's theories have carried on to present education practices. In Educational Psychology (1950), he asserted that effective study skills included a clear goal, mastery of fundamentals, knowledge of learning phenomena, concentration, and practice. There is evidence that goal setting is indeed effective in learning and retaining material. Similarly, Guthrie advocated for making clear objectives for student learning by connecting the target response to the educational stimulus. Although he believed in one-trial learning, Guthrie valued practice in the classroom. The purpose of practice is to ensure that students continue to \\"relearn\\" the material because of the uniqueness of each learning experience. He asserted that distributed, or spaced, practice is the most effective and efficient method for learning and retaining content. Distributed practice has indeed been shown to be highly effective in improving student learning and is recommended for use in classrooms today. * Guthrie, E. R. (1938).

Born in Moyahua, Zacatecas in 1890. His parents were José Camilo Estrada Haro and Micaela Reynoso Espitia. His older brother was Roque Estrada Reynoso. As a student at the School of Engineering of the capital, he was one of the students antirreeleccionistas resistance that led to the President of the Republic, General Porfirio Díaz, a statement in which he called for the resignation of his office. On the occasion of the danger to which he explained the previous event, had to leave the city and marched and joined the revolution under General Rafael Tapia in 1910. The triumph of the revolutionary movement in timber, resumed his studies at the Engineering School and he was taught classes in artillery by General Felipe Angeles. During the Decena trágica, he defended the legitimate government of Francisco I. Madero. In the year 1913, chose to leave the south of Zacatecas, in the same year, operated in conjunction with the forces of General Lucio Blanco, who then belonged, under the Army Corps Northwest commanded of General Álvaro Obregón. He was the governor of Zacatecas and Sinaloa in 1922. Among the positions he played outstanding highlights: Chief of Military Operations Campaign Yaqui, Governor and Military Commander of the State of Zacatecas; Chief of the Military Operations of the states of Michoacán, Colima, Jalisco, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes and Guanajuato, Assistant Secretary and Secretary of War and Navy, from December 14, 1920 to March 4, 1922. He was the Chief of Military Operations in Michoacán and Colima in 1923. Delahuertista rebellion In 1923, Amaro's chief of staff José Álvarez learned of the plot between generals Enrique Estrada, Guadalupe Sánchez, and Fortunato Maycotte to overthrow President Álvaro Obregón. Álvarez immediately returned to Nuevo León and informed Amaro of the plot, who promptly related the information to Obregón. The conspirators drafted Adolfo de la Huerta, then-Minister of Finance, to run for president against Plutarco Elías Calles, Obregón's chosen successor. Facing a rebellion with armies in the North, South, and East, Obregón relied on loyal generals such as Amaro to block rebel access to resources and the northern border and to put down the insurrection. Amaro, aided by General Lázaro Cárdenas, battled Estrada's forces, defeating them in the decisive battle of Ocotlán. Three days after the battle, Amaro's troops occupied Guadalajara, where Estrada's operation had been based. The rebellion crushed, the 1924 Mexican election was carried out peacefully. He was arrested in 1926 by the FBI under the leadership of by Special Agent Edwin Atherton while heading a large convoy of armored vehicles and armed men east of San Diego, California, and jailed in the United States for 21 months. Atherton had been alerted by an informant and a Mexican official in \\"lower California.\\" He supported the Escobar rebellion in 1929, and captured the future president of Mexico, Manuel Ávila Camacho, but allowed him to go free. General Estrada Reynoso died on November 3, 1942, when the post of General Manager of Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México.

The acronym QAPF stands for \\"Quartz, Alkali feldspar, Plagioclase, Feldspathoid (Foid)\\". These are the mineral groups used for classification in QAPF diagram. Q, A, P and F percentages are normalized (recalculated so that their sum is 100%). Origin QAPF diagrams were created by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS): Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks See for example the diagram as it appears in fostered by Albert Streckeisen (whence their alternative name: Streckeisen diagrams). Geologists worldwide accept the diagrams as a classification of igneous, especially plutonic rocks. Usage QAPF diagrams are mostly used to classify plutonic rocks (phaneritic rocks), but are also used to classify volcanic rocks if modal mineralogical compositions have been determined. QAPF diagrams are not used to classify pyroclastic rocks or volcanic rocks if modal mineralogical composition is not determined, instead the TAS classification (Total-Alkali-Silica) is used. TAS is also used if volcanic rock contains volcanic glass (such as obsidian). QAPF diagrams are also not used if mafic minerals make up more than 90% of the rock composition (for example: peridotites and pyroxenites). An exact name can be given only if the mineralogical composition is known, which cannot be determined in the field.  Reading QAPF diagram  The QAPF diagram utilizes four minerals, or mineral groups, to classify igneous rocks. These minerals are quartz (Q), Alkali feldspars (A), plagioclase feldspars (P), and feldspathoids (F). F and Q cannot form in plutonic rocks simultaneously due to the difference in their respective silica contents. Other minerals may occur in samples, but they are not utilized by this classification method. The QAPF diagram is composed of two ternary plots (QAP and FAP) joined along one side. To use this classification method, the concentration (the mode) of these minerals must be determined and normalized to 100%. For example: a plutonic rock that contains no alkali feldspar and no feldspathoids, but contains many pyroxenes (unlabeled in QAPF diagram), plagioclase-feldspar, and few quartz grains is probably gabbro (located at the right edge of the diagram, near P). This diagram makes no distinction between rock types of the same chemical composition in QAPF, but different chemical compositions with respect to other minerals (such as gabbro, diorite, and anorthosite). Note that this diagram is not used for all plutonic rocks. Ultramafic rocks are the most important plutonic rocks that have separate classification diagrams. References * *Streckeisen, A. L., 1978.

Cervone. A graph of a real function of a real variable is the set of ordered pairs (x,y) such that y = f(x). This is the ordinary two-dimensional Cartesian graph studied in school algebra. Every complex number has both a real part and an imaginary part, so one complex variable is two-dimensional and a pair of complex variables is four- dimensional. A tetraview is an attempt to give a picture of a four-dimensional object using a two-dimensional representation—either on a piece of paper or on a computer screen, showing a still picture consisting of five views, one in the center and one at each corner. This is roughly analogous to a picture of a three-dimensional object by giving a front view, a side view, and a view from above. A picture of a three-dimensional object is a projection of that object from three dimensions into two dimensions. A tetraview is set of five projections, first from four dimensions into three dimensions, and then from three dimensions into two dimensions. A complex function w = f(z), where z = a + bi and w = c + di are complex numbers, has a graph in four-space (four dimensional space) R4 consisting of all points (a, b, c, d) such that c + di = f(a + bi). To construct a tetraview, we begin with the four points (1,0,0,0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 0, 1), which are vertices of a spherical tetrahedron on the unit three-sphere S3 in R4.

It is the longest member of the weasel family, Mustelidae, a globally successful group of predators, reaching up to . Atypical of mustelids, the giant otter is a social species, with family groups typically supporting three to eight members. The groups are centered on a dominant breeding pair and are extremely cohesive and cooperative. Although generally peaceful, the species is territorial, and aggression has been observed between groups. The giant otter is diurnal, being active exclusively during daylight hours. It is the noisiest otter species, and distinct vocalizations have been documented that indicate alarm, aggression, and reassurance. The giant otter ranges across north-central South America; it lives mostly in and along the Amazon River and in the Pantanal. Its distribution has been greatly reduced and is now discontinuous. Decades of poaching for its velvety pelt, peaking in the 1950s and 1960s, considerably diminished population numbers. The species was listed as endangered in 1999 and wild population estimates are typically below 5,000. The Guianas are one of the last real strongholds for the species, which also enjoys modest numbers — and significant protection — in the Peruvian Amazonian basin. It is one of the most endangered mammal species in the neotropics. Habitat degradation and loss is the greatest current threat. The giant otter is also rare in captivity; in 2003, only 60 animals were being held. The giant otter shows a variety of adaptations suitable to an amphibious lifestyle, including exceptionally dense fur, a wing-like tail, and webbed feet. The species prefers freshwater rivers and streams, which are usually seasonally flooded, and may also take to freshwater lakes and springs. It constructs extensive campsites close to feeding areas, clearing large amounts of vegetation. The giant otter subsists almost exclusively on a diet of fish, particularly characins and catfish, but may also eat crabs, turtles, snakes and small caiman. It has no serious natural predators other than humans, although it must compete with other species, including the neotropical otter and caiman species, for food resources.  Naming  The giant otter has a handful of other names. In Brazil it is known as ariranha, from the Tupí word ari'raña, meaning water jaguar (). In Spanish, river wolf () and water dog () are used occasionally (though the latter also refers to several different animals) and may have been more common in the reports of explorers in the 19th and early 20th centuries.See e.g., All three names are in use in South America, with a number of regional variations. \\"Giant otter\\" translates literally as nutria gigante and lontra gigante in Spanish and Portuguese, respectively. Among the Achuar people, they are known as wankanim, and among the Sanumá as hadami. The genus name, Pteronura, is derived from the Ancient Greek words pteron/πτερόν (feather or wing) and oura/οὐρά (tail), a reference to its distinctive, wing- like tail.  Taxonomy and evolution  Giant otter head from the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi research institute The otters form the subfamily Lutrinae within the mustelids and the giant otter is the only member of the genus Pteronura. Two subspecies are currently recognized by the canonical Mammal Species of the World, P. b. brasiliensis and P. b. paraguensis. Incorrect descriptions of the species have led to multiple synonyms (the latter subspecies is often P. b. paranensis in the literature). P. b. brasiliensis is distributed across the north of the giant otter range, including the Orinoco, Amazon, and Guianas river systems; to the south, P. b. paraguensis has been suggested in Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina, although it may be extinct in the last three of these four. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) considers the species' presence in Argentina and Uruguay uncertain. In the former, investigation has shown thinly distributed population remnants. P. b. paraguensis is supposedly smaller and more gregarious, with different dentition and skull morphology. Carter and Rosas, however, rejected the subspecific division in 1997, noting the classification had only been validated once, in 1968, and the P. b. paraguensis type specimen was very similar to P. b. brasiliensis. Biologist Nicole Duplaix calls the division of \\"doubtful value\\". An extinct genus, Satherium, is believed to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World otter genus Lontra: the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the marine otter. (The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs. Giant otter fossil remains have been recovered from a cave in the Brazilian Mato Grosso. Phylogenetic analysis by Koepfli and Wayne in 1998 found the giant otter has the highest divergence sequences within the otter subfamily, forming a distinct clade that split away 10 to 14 million years ago. They noted that the species may be the basal divergence among the otters or fall outside of them altogether, having split even before other mustelids, such as the ermine, polecat, and mink. Later gene sequencing research on the mustelids, from 2005, places the divergence of the giant otter somewhat later, between five and 11 million years ago; the corresponding phylogenetic tree locates the Lontra divergence first among otter genera, and Pteronura second, although divergence ranges overlap.

Short-snouted as usual in mustelids, it has a pronounced sagittal crest, allowing for a very powerful bite in this species The giant otter is clearly distinguished from other otters by morphological and behavioural characteristics. It has the greatest body length of any species in the mustelid family, although the sea otter may be heavier. Males are between in length from head to tail and females between . The animal's well-muscled tail can add a further to the total body length.Boitani, Luigi, Simon & Schuster's Guide to Mammals. Simon & Schuster/Touchstone Books (1984), Early reports of skins and living animals suggested exceptionally large males of up to ; intensive hunting likely reduced the occurrence of such massive specimens. Weights are between for males and for females. The giant otter has the shortest fur of all otter species; it is typically chocolate brown, but may be reddish or fawn, and appears nearly black when wet. The fur is extremely dense, so much so that water cannot penetrate to the skin. Guard hairs trap water and keep the inner fur dry; the guard hairs are approximately 8 millimetres (one-third of an inch) in length, about twice as long as the fur of the inner coat. Its velvety feel makes the animal highly sought after by fur traders and has contributed to its decline. Unique markings of white or cream fur color the throat and under the chin, allow individuals to be identified from birth. Giant otters use these marks to recognize one another, and upon meeting other otters, they engage in a behavior known as \\"periscoping\\", displaying their throats and upper chests to each other. Giant otter muzzles are short and sloping and give the head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is completely covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater. At the time of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been directly studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, it is able to recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent. The species possesses 2n = 38 chromosomes.  Biology and behaviour  The giant otter is large, gregarious, and diurnal. Early travelers' reports describe noisy groups surrounding explorers' boats, but little scientific information was available on the species until Duplaix's groundbreaking work in the late 1970s. Concern over this endangered species has since generated a body of research. = Vocalisations = The giant otter is an especially noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter may be the most vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates. Each family of otters was shown to have its own unique audio signature. = Social structure = The giant otter is a highly social animal and lives in extended family groups. Group sizes are anywhere from two to 20 members, but likely average between four and eight. (Larger figures may reflect two or three family groups temporarily feeding together.) The groups are strongly cohesive: the otters sleep, play, travel, and feed together. Giant otters leave a pool together at the Philadelphia Zoo. The species is extremely social, a rarity among mustelids and family groups are cohesive. Group members share roles, structured around the dominant breeding pair. The species is territorial, with groups marking their ranges with latrines, gland secretions, and vocalizations. At least one case of a change in alpha relationship has been reported, with a new male taking over the role; the mechanics of the transition were not determined. Duplaix suggests a division between \\"residents\\", who are established within groups and territories, and nomadic and solitary \\"transients\\"; the categories do not seem rigid, and both may be a normal part of the giant otter life cycle. One tentative theory for the development of sociality in mustelids is that locally abundant, but unpredictably dispersed, and prey causes groups to form. Aggression within the species (\\"intraspecific\\" conflict) has been documented. Defence against intruding animals appears to be cooperative: while adult males typically lead in aggressive encounters, cases of alpha females guarding groups have been reported. One fight was directly observed in the Brazilian Pantanal in which three animals violently engaged a single individual near a range boundary. In another instance in Brazil, a carcass was found with clear indications of violent assault by other otters, including bites to the snout and genitals, an attack pattern similar to that exhibited by captive animals. While not rare among large predators in general, intraspecific aggression is uncommon among otter species; Ribas and Mourão suggest a correlation to the animal's sociability, which is also rare among other otters. A capacity for aggressive behavior should not be overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted. Within groups, the animals are extremely peaceful and cooperative. Group hierarchies are not rigid and the animals easily share roles. = Reproduction and life cycle = A giant otter den dug on a lakeshore at Cantão State Park — the newly dug white sand is a sign of recent activity at this den. Giant otters build dens, which are holes dug into riverbanks, usually with multiple entrances and multiple chambers inside. They give birth within these dens during the dry season. In Cantão State Park, otters dig their reproductive dens on the shores of oxbow lakes starting around July, when waters are already quite low. They give birth between August and September, and the young pups emerge for the first time in October and November, which are the months of lowest water and fish concentrations in the dwindling lakes and channels are at their peak. This makes it easier for the adults to catch enough fish for the growing young, and for the pups to learn how to catch fish. The entire group, including nonreproductive adults, which are usually older siblings to that year's pups, collaborates to catch enough fish for the young. Details of giant otter reproduction and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided much of the information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days. Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation. At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water. Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, with an average of two. Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive. Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild. Captive giant otters have contributed greatly to scientific knowledge of the species by providing readily available subjects for research on the species' reproduction and life cycle. Mothers give birth to furred and blind cubs in an underground den near the river shore and fishing sites. Males actively participate in rearing cubs and family cohesion is strong; older, juvenile siblings also participate in rearing, although in the weeks immediately after birth, they may temporarily leave the group. Pups open their eyes in their fourth week, begin walking in their fifth, and are able to swim confidently between 12 and 14 weeks old. They are weaned by nine months and begin hunting successfully soon after. The animal reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age and both male and female pups leave the group permanently after two to three years. They then search for new territory to begin a family of their own. The giant otter is very sensitive to human activity when rearing its young. No institution, for example, has successfully raised giant otter cubs unless parents were provided sufficient privacy measures; the stress caused by human visual and acoustic interference can lead to neglect, abuse and infanticide, as well as decreased lactation. In the wild, it has been suggested, although not systematically confirmed, that tourists cause similar stresses: disrupted lactation and denning, reduced hunting, and habitat abandonment are all risks. This sensitivity is matched by a strong protectiveness towards the young. All group members may aggressively charge intruders, including boats with humans in them. The longest documented giant otter lifespan in the wild is eight years. In captivity, this may increase to 17, with an unconfirmed record of 19. The animal is susceptible to a variety of diseases, including canine parvovirus. Parasites, such as the larvae of flies and a variety of intestinal worms, also afflict the giant otter. Other causes of death include accidents, gastroenteritis, infanticide, and epileptic seizures. = Hunting and diet = A captive giant otter, when feeding, grasps prey in its forepaws and begins eating immediately, at the head. The giant otter is an apex predator, and its population status reflects the overall health of riverine ecosystems. It feeds mainly on fish, including cichlids, characins (such as piranha), and catfish. One full-year study of giant otter scats in Amazonian Brazil found fish present in all fecal samples. Fish from the order Perciformes, particularly cichlids, were seen in 97% of scats, and Characiformes, such as characins, in 86%. Fish remains were of medium-sized species that seem to prefer relatively shallow water, to the advantage of the probably visually oriented giant otter. Prey species found were also sedentary, generally swimming only short distances, which may aid the giant otter in predation. Hunting in shallow water has also been found to be more rewarding, with water depth less than having the highest success rate. The giant otter seems to be opportunistic, taking whatever species are most locally abundant. If fish are unavailable, it will also take crabs, snakes, and even small caimans and anacondas. The species can hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on sharp eyesight to locate prey. In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, a result of group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter, such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman. The giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water. Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head. Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.  Ecology  = Habitat = The species is amphibious, although primarily terrestrial. It occurs in freshwater rivers and streams, which generally flood seasonally. Other water habitats include freshwater springs and permanent freshwater lakes. Four specific vegetation types occur on one important creek in Suriname: riverbank high forest, floodable mixed marsh and high swamp forest, floodable low marsh forest, and grass islands and floating meadows within open areas of the creek itself. Duplaix identified two critical factors in habitat selection: food abundance, which appears to positively correlate to shallow water, and low sloping banks with good cover and easy access to preferred water types. The giant otter seems to choose clear, black waters with rocky or sandy bottoms over silty, saline, and white waters. A group of four giant otters emerging from the water to patrol a campsite on the riverbank at Cantão State Park Giant otters use areas beside rivers for building dens, campsites, and latrines. They clear significant amounts of vegetation while building their campsites. One report suggests maximum areas long and wide, well-marked by scent glands, urine, and feces to signal territory. Carter and Rosas found average areas a third this size. Giant otters adopt communal latrines beside campsites, and dig dens with a handful of entrances, typically under root systems or fallen trees. One report found between three and eight campsites, clustered around feeding areas. In seasonally flooded areas, the giant otter may abandon campsites during the wet season, dispersing to flooded forests in search of prey. Giant otters may adopt preferred locations perennially, often on high ground. These can become quite extensive, including \\"backdoor\\" exits into forests and swamps, away from the water. Otters do not visit or mark every site daily, but usually patrol all of them, often by a pair of otters in the morning. Research generally takes place in the dry season and an understanding of the species' overall habitat use remains partial. An analysis of dry season range size for three otter groups in Ecuador found areas between . Utreras presumed habitat requirements and availability would differ dramatically in the rainy season: estimating range sizes of 1.98 to as much as 19.55 square kilometres (0.76 to 7.55 sq miles) for the groups. Other researchers suggest approximately and note a strong inverse correlation between sociality and home range size; the highly social giant otter has smaller home range sizes than would be expected for a species of its mass. See figure three for home range size estimate. Population densities varied with a high of reported in Suriname and with a low of found in Guyana. = Predation and competition = Characins such as piranha species are prey for the giant otter, but these aggressive fish may also pose a danger. Duplaix speculated that piranhas may attack giant otters. Adult giant otters living in family groups have no known serious natural predators, however there are some accounts of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but this is based on historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals. Even if without direct predation, the giant otter must still compete with other predators for food resources. Duplaix documented interaction with the neotropical otter.Lontra longicaudis. In it was listed as the Guiana Otter under the older binomial Lutra enudris. While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, there appeared to be no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical otter is far more shy, less noisy, and less social; at about a third the weight of the giant otter, it is more vulnerable to predation, hence, a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage. The neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal giant otter. Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction. Other species that prey upon similar food resources include the caimans and large fish that are themselves piscivores. Gymnotids, such as the electric eel, and the large silurid catfish are among aquatic competitors. Two river dolphins, the tucuxi and boto, might potentially compete with the giant otter, but different spatial use and dietary preferences suggest minimal overlap. Furthermore, Defler observed associations between giant otters and the Amazon river dolphins, and suggested that dolphins may benefit by fish fleeing from the otters. The spectacled caiman is another potential competitor, but Duplaix found no conflict with the species in Suriname.  Conservation status  The IUCN listed the giant otter as \\"endangered\\" in 1999; it had been considered \\"vulnerable\\" under all previous listings from 1982 when sufficient data had first become available. It is regulated internationally under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES): all trade in specimens and parts is illegal. = Threats = The animal faces a variety of critical threats. Poaching has long been a problem. Statistics show between 1959 and 1969 Amazonian Brazil alone accounted for 1,000 to 3,000 pelts annually. The species was so thoroughly decimated, the number dropped to just 12 in 1971. The implementation of CITES in 1973 finally brought about significant hunting reductions, although demand did not disappear entirely: in the 1980s, pelt prices were as high as US$250 on the European market. The threat has been exacerbated by the otters' relative fearlessness and tendency to approach human beings. They are extremely easy to hunt, being active through the day and highly inquisitive. The animal's relatively late sexual maturity and complex social life makes hunting especially disastrous. More recently, habitat destruction and degradation have become the principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% is expected in giant otter numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging in parts of the giant otter range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant otter. Other threats to the giant otter include conflict with fishermen, who often view the species as a nuisance (see below). Ecotourism also presents challenges: while it raises money and awareness for the animals, by its nature it also increases human effect on the species, both through associated development and direct disturbances in the field. A number of restrictions on land use and human intrusion are required to properly maintain wild populations. Schenck et al., who undertook extensive fieldwork in Peru in the 1990s, suggest specific \\"no-go\\" zones where the species is most frequently observed, offset by observation towers and platforms to allow viewing. Limits on the number of tourists at any one time, fishing prohibitions, and a minimum safe distance of are proposed to offer further protection. = Distribution and population = Giant otter from Venezuela. The giant otter has lost as much as 80% of its South American range. While still present in a number of north-central countries, giant otter populations are under considerable stress. The IUCN lists Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela as current range countries. Given local extinctions, the species' range has become discontinuous. Total population numbers are difficult to estimate. An IUCN study in 2006 suggested 1,000 to 5,000 otters remain. Populations in Bolivia were once widespread but the country became a \\"black spot\\" on distribution maps after poaching between the 1940s and 1970s; a relatively healthy, but still small, population of 350 was estimated in the country in 2002. The species has likely been extirpated from southern Brazil, but in the west of the country, decreased hunting pressure in the critical Pantanal has led to very successful recolonization; an estimate suggests 1,000 or more animals in the region. The Guianas are the last real stronghold of the giant otter. Suriname retains extensive forest cover and many protected areas; it is pictured above. Guyana is immediately to the west and French Guiana is immediately to the east. In 2006, most of this species lived in the Brazilian Amazon and its bordering areas. A significant population lives in the wetlands of the central Araguaia River, and in particular within Cantão State Park, which, with its 843 oxbow lakes and extensive flooded forests and marshlands, is one of the best habitat patches for this species in Brazil. Suriname still has significant forest cover and an extensive system of protected areas, much of which protects the giant otter. Duplaix returned to the country in 2000 and found the giant otter still present on the Kaburi Creek, a \\"jewel\\" of biodiversity, although increased human presence and land use suggests, sooner or later, the species may not be able to find suitable habitat for campsites. In a report for World Wildlife Fund in 2002, Duplaix was emphatic about the importance of Suriname and the other Guianas: Other countries have taken a lead in designating protected areas in South America. In 2004, Peru created one of the largest conservation areas in the world, Alto Purús National Park, with an area similar in size to Belgium. The park harbors many endangered plants and animals, including the giant otter, and holds the world record for mammal diversity. Bolivia designated wetlands larger than the size of Switzerland as a freshwater protected area in 2001; these are also home to the giant otter.  Interactions with indigenous peoples  Throughout its range, the giant otter interacts with indigenous groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native attitudes toward the animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told of the importance of the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal. Velasco, Diana Marcela (2005). \\"Estudio preliminar sobre el estado de conservación de la nutria gigante (Pteronura brasiliensis) en la zona de influencia de Inírida (Bajo río Inírida) Guainía, Colombia\\" (PDF). Giant Otter Research. Retrieved on 2008-01-27. In Suriname, the giant otter is not a traditional prey species for human hunters, which affords some protection. (One researcher has suggested the giant otter is hunted only in desperation due to its horrible taste.) The animal sometimes drowns in nets set across rivers and machete attacks by fishermen have been noted, according to Duplaix, but \\"tolerance is the rule\\" in Suriname. One difference in behavior was seen in the country in 2002: the normally inquisitive giant otters showed \\"active avoidance behavior with visible panic\\" when boats appeared. Logging, hunting, and pup seizure may have led groups to be far more wary of human activity. Local people sometimes take pups for the exotic pet trade or as pets for themselves, but the animal rapidly grows to become unmanageable. Duplaix relates the story of an Arawak Indian who took two pups from their parents. While revealing of the affection held for the animals, the seizure was a profound blow to the breeding pair, which went on to lose their territory to competitors. The species has also appeared in the folklore of the region. It plays an important role in the mythology of the Achuar people, where giant otters are seen as a form of the tsunki, or water spirits: they are a sort of \\"water people\\" who feed on fish. They appear in a fish poisoning legend where they assist a man who has wasted his sexual energy, creating the anacondas of the world from his distressed and extended genitals. The Bororó people have a legend on the origin of tobacco smoking: those who used the leaf improperly by swallowing it were punished by being transformed into giant otters; the Bororo also associate the giant otter with fish and with fire. A Ticuna legend has it that the giant otter exchanged places with the jaguar: the story says jaguar formerly lived in the water and the giant otter came to the land only to eat. The indigenous Kichwa peoples from Amazonian Peru believed in a world of water where Yaku runa reigned as mother of the water and was charged with caring for fish and animals. Giant otters served as Yaku runa's canoes. A Maxacali creation story suggests that the practice of otter fishing may have been prevalent in the past.

A right-handed pitcher,https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/c/chancde01.shtml Dean Chance Page at Baseball- Reference.com he played in 11 Major League Baseball seasons for the Los Angeles Angels, Minnesota Twins, Cleveland Indians, New York Mets and Detroit Tigers. With a touch of wildness and the habit of never looking at home plate once he received the sign from his catcher, Chance would turn his back fully towards the hitter in mid-windup before spinning and unleashing a good fastball, sinker or sidearm curveball. In 1964, Chance became at the time the youngest pitcher to win the Cy Young Award when, as a member of the Los Angeles Angels, he led the American League in wins (20), innings pitched (278) and earned run average (1.65—as of 2015, a franchise record) and was third in the A.L. in strikeouts. He pitched 11 shutouts (also a franchise record as of 2015) that season, winning five of those by a 1–0 score. At the time, only one Cy Young Award was given in all of MLB; since 1967, separate awards have been given in the AL and the National League.https://www.baseball- reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml List of Cy Young Award winners at Baseball- Reference.com Chance's Cy Young Award was the third in a string of five consecutive Cy Young Awards won by a pitcher from a Los Angeles-based team. The others were won by Dodger pitchers: Don Drysdale in 1962 and Sandy Koufax in 1963, 1965, and 1966. Baseball career Chance attended West Salem's Northwestern High School (Ohio) and starred on the baseball team and basketball teams (leading the team to a 1958 state title), but baseball is where Chance would shine. During his high school years, he set several state records which still stand including a 52–1 career record, 20 wins in a season, 32 straight wins, eight no-hitters in a season (in both his junior and senior years), and 17 no-hitters total. He also led the Huskies to the Class A state semifinals in 1958 and a championship in 1959 (and pitching every inning of every postseason tournament game). Following high school, Chance signed with the Baltimore Orioles (for a $30,000 bonus and $12 Greyhound bus ticket) prior to the start of the 1959 season as an amateur free agent. After signing, he was assigned to the Bluefield Orioles in the class-D Appalachian League where he went 10–3 with a 2.94 ERA. In 1960, he went 12–9 for Fox Cities Foxes in class-B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. On December 14, 1960, Chance was drafted by the Washington Senators as the 48th pick in the 1960 AL expansion draft. Immediately following the draft, Chance was traded by the Senators to the Los Angeles Angels for outfielder Joe Hicks. He pitched most of 1961 for the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers, going 9–12, before making his major league debut on September 11, 1961, at the age of 20. Chance finished the season 0–2 with a 6.87 ERA in five games, but was in the majors to stay. Chance had an outstanding rookie campaign in 1962, winning 14 games with an ERA of 2.96 and finishing tied for third in AL Rookie of the Year voting with Bernie Allen and Dick Radatz (behind fellow Angel Buck Rodgers and winner Tom Tresh). The 1962 campaign was notable for the Angels as Chance and fellow phenom Bo Belinsky teamed on both the mound and in the Hollywood social circles, much to the enjoyment of the Los Angeles beat writers and the consternation of manager Bill Rigney and the rest of the Angels' front office. Although he lost 18 games in 1963, he finished with a 3.19 ERA in 248 innings. The pair were inseparable and often roomed together, some saying so that the Angels' would only have to mind one bad room – at least when they were in their room after curfew (which was not often). After his 1964 season in which he won the Cy Young Award and was elected to his first All-Star Game, Chance went 15–10 in 1965 and 12–17 in 1966, despite a respectable ERA of 3.08. After the 1966 season, the Angels, a weak hitting team desperate for power and looking to shed one of their problem children, shipped Chance and infielder Jackie Hernández to the Minnesota Twins on December 2 in a trade that netted them outfielder Jimmie Hall, slugging first baseman Don Mincher, and relief pitcher Pete Cimino.Angels trade Dean Chance for three Minnesota Twins Chance responded by winning 20 games for the Twins in 1967, leading the AL in games started (39), complete games (18) and innings pitched (283). On August 6 of that year, he pitched a rain-shortened, five-inning perfect game against the Red Sox at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota.http://retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1967/B08060MIN1967.htm Box Score and Play by Play from Retrosheet He also pitched a 2–1 no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians on August 25 with the Indians scoring their sole run in the first inning on two walks, an error, and a wild pitch.http://retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1967/B08252CLE1967.htm Box Score and Play by Play from Retrosheet Chance later said that umpire Ed Runge's wide strike zone had a lot to do with him keeping the Indians off the basepaths. The Twins nearly won the 1967 pennant, but Chance was outdueled in the season's final game, at Fenway Park, by Boston's Jim Lonborg, chasing Chance in with 5 runs in the sixth despite getting only one ball out of the infield, and the Red Sox emerged as surprise league champions — with Lonborg winning the 1967 AL Cy Young trophy in the process.https://www.baseball- reference.com/teams/MIN/1967-schedule-scores.shtml 1967 Minnesota Twins Game Log from Baseball-Reference.com The trade helped both teams and Chance as the Angels rose to fifth place with an 84–77 record in 1967, the Twins were in it until the season's final game, and Chance was voted to his second all-star team and won the Sporting News AL Comeback Player of the Year award. The 1968 campaign saw Chance put up a lackluster 16–16 record (echoing the Twins' 79–83 finish), but saw him notch career lows in hits and walks per 9 innings (6.9 and 1.9 respectively), and career highs in innings (292), strikeouts (234), and strikeouts per 9 innings (7.9). Due to his strong numbers, Chance had more than a decent chance at again winning 20 games, but the Twins offense let him down in 1968, scoring two runs or fewer in 17 of his 22 starts (games in which Chance himself posted an ERA of 2.55). In the games in which the Twins scored at least three runs, Chance posted a 13–4 record. Despite his strong season, owner Calvin Griffith, well known for being \\"thrifty\\", tried to cut Chance's salary by $9,000. Chance held out prior to the 1969 season and was successful in having his salary cut by \\"only\\" $5,000. However, 1968 was his last big year before his career rapidly declined. From 1969–1971, he won only 18 games. In 1969, he was plagued by a back injury caused by rushing to get into shape following his holdout and only pitched 88 innings. On December 10, 1969, the Twins shipped Chance, third baseman (and future New York Yankees star) Graig Nettles, infielder Ted Uhlaender, and pitcher Bob Miller to the Cleveland Indians for relief pitcher Stan Williams and future Boston Red Sox star Luis Tiant. The trade was a disaster for the Twins as Nettles immediately blossomed and hit 26 home runs for the 1970 Indians and Tiant, the key to the trade, was released after only one injury-plagued season. Chance split the 1970 season between the Indians, for whom he pitched a 9–8 record with a 4.28, and the New York Mets (after being purchased from the Indians on September 18). Chance was traded again on March 30, 1971, this time to the Detroit Tigers along with reliever Bill Denehy for minor league pitcher Jerry Robertson. Used largely out of the bullpen, Chance finished his career with a 4–6 record in 31 games. His career record over 11 seasons (1961–71) and 406 games pitched was 128 wins, 115 losses and an ERA of 2.92. He was a notoriously weak batsman in the days prior to the designated hitter, garnering only 44 hits in 662 at bats, for a batting average . He struck out 420 times in those 662 at-bats. Baseball author Bill James named Chance, along with Ron Herbel as the worst hitting pitchers of the 1960s. Retirement Chance retired to a 300-acre ranch from his boyhood farm During the 1970s and 1980s Chance acted as a midway barker and operated games of skill at carnivals and fairs and was one of the most successful operators, eventually employing 250 people and running 40 games at the Ohio State Fair alone, on a circuit that includes Columbus, Ohio, Raleigh, North Carolina, Augusta, Georgia, Syracuse, New York, Hollywood, Florida, and Corpus Christi, Texas before tiring of the constant travels and con men who frequented this business. Chance founded the International Boxing Association during the 1990s, managed many fighters, and was its long-time president. As part of the Angels' 50th anniversary, Chance threw out the first pitch before the June 4, 2011 game versus the New York Yankees. Chance had one child, son Brett, who graduated from Ohio State University in 1985 and worked as an executive for the Ohio State Fair, the Ohio Expo Center, and Instagram. In August 2015 Chance was inducted into the Angels Hall of Fame. Chance died at his home in Wooster on October 11, 2015 at the age of 74.https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-dean-chance-angels-cy- young-winner-dies-20151011-story.html See also * List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball no-hitters References External links * Category:1941 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American League All-Stars Category:American League ERA champions Category:American League wins champions Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:Bluefield Orioles players Category:California Angels players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Cy Young Award winners Category:Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Fox Cities Foxes players Category:Los Angeles Angels players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Minnesota Twins players Category:New York Mets players Category:People from Wooster, Ohio ","title":"Dean Chance"},{"id":"2607078","text":"Landolt C optotypes in various sizes and orientations Golovin-Sivtsev Table The Landolt C, also known as a Landolt ring, Landolt broken ring, or Japanese vision test, is an optotype: a standardized symbol used for testing vision. It was developed by the Swiss-born ophthalmologist Edmund Landolt. The Landolt C consists of a ring that has a gap, thus looking similar to the letter C. The gap can be at various positions (usually left, right, bottom, top and the 45° positions in between) and the task of the tested person is to decide on which side the gap is. The size of the C and its gap are reduced until the subject makes a specified rate of errors. The minimum perceivable angle of the gap is taken as measure of the visual acuity. It is generally practised in the laboratory.\\"eye, human.\\"Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008.

Although accepted as a 'gold standard', this optotype has its own inherent problems, possibly due to higher brain function where the gap will appear closed near the limit of resolution, especially when the gap is at the 6 o'clock position.

Located at 14 Agege Motor Road, Idi-Oro, Mushin, Lagos, Nigeria, it had a free health clinic, and recording facility. Fela declared it independent from the state ruled by the military junta after he returned from the United States in 1970. The compound burned to the ground on February 18, 1977 after an assault by a thousand armed soldiers. \\"Kalakuta\\" was a mockery of a prison cell named \\"Calcutta\\" that Fela inhabited.Fela: The Life and Times of an African Musical Icon By Michael E. Veal, p. 143 Before the attack on Fela's home, he made a record called Zombie, about the Nigerian military regime. In the song, soldiers are called zombies for obeying orders blindly. One of the lines of the song, in West African Pidgin English, says, \\"Zombie no go walk unless you tell am to walk\\", i.e., a zombie won't walk unless commanded. Fela was frustrated with the Nigerian army's rank and file that allowed corruption and intimidation of their communities by the corrupt and rich top brass, while blindly following orders to intimidate Nigerians. The song was popular in Nigeria, upsetting then-Head of State General Olusegun Obasanjo. The military was unhappy with Fela's constant criticism and said it was unseemly to have a republic within a republic. Nigerian tabloids carried lurid but unverified tales of girls lured to the compound and corrupted by Fela's band members. During the attack at the Kalakuta Republic by the Nigerian Armed Forces, Fela's mother Francis Abigail Olufunmilayo Thomas was thrown from a window of the second floor. She died after being in a coma for about eight weeks. Fela failed in his initial plan to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Kalakuta Republic sacking by marrying 27 of his back-up singers in a mass wedding ceremony at the office of his lawyer, Tunji Braithwaite. Two days later, on February 20, 1978, he secretly married the 27 women popularly known as \\"Queens\\" at the defunct Parisona Hotel along Ikorodu Road in Lagos. Fela said he would not have marital relationship with all of the women as the tabloids suggested, but had married them as they could not find employment after the recording studio had been burnt down. According to Fela, in African tradition, when a woman was in danger of being left destitute, it was the duty of a man in her community to marry her as a means of offering protection.

The Venus of Urbino (also known as Reclining Venus) is an oil painting by the Italian painter Titian, which seems to have been begun in 1532 or 1534, and was perhaps completed in 1534, but not sold until 1538. It depicts a nude young woman, traditionally identified with the goddess Venus, reclining on a couch or bed in the sumptuous surroundings of a Renaissance palace. It is now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. The figure's pose is based on the Dresden Venus, traditionally attributed to Giorgione but which Titian at least completed the landscape. In this depiction, Titian has domesticated Venus by moving her to an indoor setting, engaging her with the viewer, and making her sensuality explicit; some even believe the figure is engaging in masturbation.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000f1t2 Interpretations of the painting fall into two groups; both agree that the painting has a powerful erotic charge, but beyond that it is seen either as a portrait of a courtesan, perhaps Zaffetta, or as a painting celebrating the marriage of its first owner (who according to some may not have commissioned it). This disagreement forms part of a wider debate on the meaning of the mainly Venetian tradition of the reclining female nude, which Titian had created, or helped to create, some 25 years before with the Dresden Venus of around 1510–11. For Charles Hope, \\"It has yet to be shown that the most famous example of this genre, Titian's Venus of Urbino, is anything other than a representation of a beautiful nude woman on a bed, devoid of classical or even allegorical content.\\"Hope, 56 Even the indefatigable finder of allegories drawing on Renaissance Neoplatonism, Edgar Wind, had to admit that in this case \\"an undisguised hedonism had at last dispelled the Platonic metaphors\\".Wind, 141 A recent theory by Józef Grabski suggests that the painting represents an allegory of marital love between famous Italian poet Vittoria Colonna and her deceased husband, Fernando d'Ávalos. Grabski supports his theory through analyzing various visual clues and symbols, the most prominent being the classic column in front of the trees in the window in the right half, a small detail on the painting that imitates the Colonna Family coat of arms. Description The Venus stares straight at the viewer, unconcerned with her nudity. In her right hand she holds a posy of roses whilst she holds her other hand over her genitals. In the near background is a dog, often a symbol of fidelity. In a different space in the background two maids are shown rummaging through a cassone chest, where clothes were kept. The detailed depiction of the interior setting is unusual, perhaps unique, in Titian.Goffen (1997a), 83-84 Titian contracted for the 21 year old Ippolito de' Medici, reluctantly made a cardinal (though not a priest), by his uncle, Pope Clement VII. He was trying to pursue a military career, and was a papal diplomat. On 20 October 1532 he spent the night in Venice with Angela del Moro, or Angela Zaffetta, a leading courtesan in Venice and sometimes a dining companion of Titian and Aretino, the latter a friend of the cardinal. Titian painted Ippolito's portrait, and it seems likely that he was asked to add a nude portrait of Angela Zaffetta, or that Titian decided to paint one in the hope he would like it.Hale, 337-341Johan Zoffany, The Tribuna of the Uffizi, 1770s On 20 December 1534 Titian wrote to Ippolito's chamberlain in Rome saying that he had been working on a painting of a woman for the cardinal. Ippolito died in August 1535, and apparently never saw the painting, which was still in Titian's studio when Guidobaldo II della Rovere, the 24-year-old son of the Duke of Urbino came in January 1538 to sit for a portrait. As letters from him and his mother show, he was extremely keen to buy it, and did so some months later; he refers to it simply as \\"the nude woman\\", and was worried Titian would sell it to someone else.Hale, 341-345 Later that year he inherited the Duchy of Urbino on the death of his father, hence the painting acquired the name by which it is usually known, although it seems it was mostly kept in Pesaro from early on. Alternatively, the painting may have been commissioned by Guidobaldo, possibly to celebrate his marriage in 1534 to the 10 year-old Giulia Varano, which made him Duke of Camerino, or its consummation, which was probably a few years later.Goffen (1997a), 81 Some critics have seen references to marriage in details such as the maids at the cassone, where the corredo or trousseau of clothes generally given to the bride by her husband's family were stored. Rona Goffen sees Venus's hand \\"caressing\\" her genitals as such a reference, as it was believed at the time that a female \\"emission\\" or orgasm was necessary for conception to take place, and female masturbation was therefore allowed only in cases where the male had ejaculated and withdrawn. The production of heirs was of great concern in elite marriages. Even the little dog on the bed has been brought into the argument; an identical dog is shown in Titian's portrait of the duke's mother Eleonora Gonzaga, the reasoning being that the dog identifies the house as a della Rovere home, and that it remains quiet indicates that the viewer is the husband of the woman.Goffen (1997b), 151-152; Sheila Hale finds talk of the dog \\"absurd\\", 762, note 5 Édouard Manet's Olympia, 1863 =Later history= In 1624, as the Papacy moved to fully annex the duchy to the Papal States, the della Rovere court moved to Pesaro, where the painting hung in the Villa Imperiale. It joined the Medici family collections in 1633 when the last della Rovere, Vittoria della Rovere, married Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. It was moved to the Uffizi in 1736, and has remained there ever since, apart from visits to exhibitions which in the 21st century have included Madrid, Brussels, Tokyo, Venice and Urbino.\\"Titian masterpiece temporarily returns to Urbino\\" by Mary Gray, The Florentine, 2 August 2016 It has long been famous, as is shown by its prominent placing at the front of the gallery group portrait by Johan Zoffany of the Tribuna of the Uffizi of the 1770s. In his 1880 travelogue A Tramp Abroad, Mark Twain called the Venus of Urbino \\"the foulest, the vilest, the obscenest picture the world possesses\\". He proposed that \\"it was painted for a bagnio [brothel], and it was probably refused because it was a trifle too strong\\", adding humorously that \\"in truth, it is a trifle too strong for any place but a public art gallery\\". Twain does this to juxtapose the artistic license (for nudity, for example) allowed in painting, as opposed to the restrictions and Victorian morality imposed on literature in the \\"last eighty or ninety years\\". In the same passage, Twain also mocks the fig leaves placed in the 19th century on nude statues in Rome, which had \\"stood in innocent nakedness for ages.\\" The Venus of Urbino was one of the inspirations for Édouard Manet's 1863 Olympia, in which the figure of Venus is replaced with the model Victorine Meurent.Honour, H. and Fleming, J. (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 709. Goffen (1997a), 71  Sculptures  Lorenzo Bartolini developed the same theme in sculpture with his Venus (about 1830), based on the painting that his friend J.A.D. Ingres copied for him from the Titian version. The original sculpture is located at the Musée Fabre in Montpellier; a copy is at the Lady Lever Art Gallery near Liverpool.

It is located in central Massachusetts, northeast of Worcester. It is part of the water supply system for metropolitan Boston maintained by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). It has an aggregate capacity of and an area of almost 7 square miles (18.2 km²). Water from the Wachusett flows to the covered Norumbega Storage Facility via the Cosgrove Tunnel and the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel. The reservoir has a maximum depth of 120 feet (36.5 m) and a mean depth of 48 feet (14.6 m). The reservoir serves as both an intermediate storage reservoir for water from the Quabbin Reservoir, and a water source itself, fed by its own watershed. The reservoir is fed by the Quinapoxet, and Stillwater rivers, along with the Quabbin Aqueduct, which carries water from the Quabbin Reservoir. It is part of the Nashua River Watershed and is the headwaters of the Nashua River. Because it is an intermediate storage reservoir, its water levels are kept relatively constant while the Quabbin Reservoir fluctuates based on precipitation and demand. At times when the Wachusett Reservoir becomes high due to its own watershed producing a large amount of runoff such as during snow melting, the flow from the Quabbin is shut off and water from the Ware River flows backwards down the Quabbin Aqueduct into the Quabbin Reservoir for storage.  History  In 1897, the Nashua River above the town of Clinton was impounded by the Wachusett Dam; 4,380 acres (17.5 km²) were flooded in the towns of Boylston, West Boylston, Clinton, and Sterling. Work was completed in 1905 and the reservoir first filled in May 1908. Its water was originally delivered to the Sudbury Reservoir via the Wachusett Aqueduct, with the Cosgrove Tunnel (completed in 1965) providing redundancy. Interconnections at the Sudbury Reservoir eventually delivered the water to the Weston Reservoir via the Weston Aqueduct; these downstream facilities were relegated to backup roles in the late 20th and early 21st century by the construction of the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel and covered storage facilities. West Boylston's prominent landmark—The Old Stone Church—was left remaining as a reminder of those that lost their homes and jobs to the building of the reservoir. It is one of the most photographed sites in the area. When it was built, the Wachusett Reservoir was the largest public water supply reservoir in the world and the largest body of water in Massachusetts. It has since been surpassed by the Quabbin Reservoir (see that article for a history of reservoir building in Massachusetts).  Recreation and fishing  Because the reservoir is the water supply for Boston, not all areas around it are open to the public. Regulations designed to ensure pure water include the prohibiting of boats, ice fishing, wading, swimming, overnight camping, alcoholic beverages, littering, animals, bikes, and motor vehicles from the reservoir and abutting property. These regulations are controversial to recreation and fishing proponents, who argue the rules are not needed to protect water quality. A network of fire roads provides easy access for hikers and cross-country skiers. In 1999, the reservoir contained 12 native and 12 introduced species of fish. The limited access, combined with abundant, high-quality habitat, produced state records for brown trout, land-locked salmon, smallmouth bass, and white perch. Approximately 80% of the 37 mile (59.5 km) shoreline is usually open to angling from April 1 through November 30, depending on ice conditions.

Third-party clients such as Pidgin and Trillian can also communicate using the protocol. MSNP was first used in a publicly available product with the first release of MSN Messenger in 1999.  Technical details  Any major change made to the protocol, such as a new command or syntax changes, results in a version-number incremented by one in the format of MSNP#. During October 2003, Microsoft started blocking access to Messenger service using versions below MSNP8. Starting on September 11, 2007, Microsoft forces most current users of MSN Messenger to upgrade to Windows Live Messenger 8.1 due to security considerations. Version history =MSNP1= MSNP1 has never been public. It is believed it was used during the early stages of design and development with MSN Messenger 1 =MSNP2= A pre-release version was made available to developers in 1999 in an Internet Draft. However, the production version differed from the published version in a few subtle ways. =MSNP3= Both MSNP2 and MSNP3 were supported by MSN Messenger 2.0 =MSNP4 and MSNP5= MSNP3, 4, and 5 were supported by the Messenger servers by July 2000 and used by MSN Messenger 3.0 and 4.0. =MSNP6 and MSNP7= MSNP6 was used by later versions of MSN Messenger 4.x. In 2002 MSN Messenger 5.0 used MSNP7. =MSNP8= MSNP8 introduced a different authentication method, now sending authorization to Microsoft Passport's secure servers and returning a challenge string. It is the minimum version of the protocol accepted by .NET Messenger Service after Microsoft blocked earlier versions for security reasons. As such, old and obsolete clients are unable to sign in, forcing users to upgrade clients. Version 5.0 of MSN Messenger is the only one that uses this MSNP version. Windows Messenger uses MSNP8 as its standard version, including 4.7 up to the latest 5.1. This protocol supports Windows Messenger-to-Windows Messenger webcam and voice capabilities. =MSNP9= MSNP9 was introduced with MSN Messenger 6, adding support for \\"D type\\" (data) messages, which are used for transferring display pictures and custom emoticons between clients, frame- by-frame web cam (rather than a traditional stream like Windows Media Player's WMV format) and an improved voice system, as well as improved NAT traversal for file transfers. =MSNP10= Employed in MSN Messenger 6.1, after Microsoft started blocking earlier versions in October 2003. However, it was not a big overhaul, the only obvious change was integration with Hotmail address books. =MSNP11= Employed by MSN Messenger 7.0 =MSNP12= Employed by MSN Messenger 7.5. =MSNP13= Employed by Windows Live Messenger 8.0, MSNP13 features a lot of changes. Most notably, contact list synchronization has been removed and clients must instead send a SOAP request to a contacts server, also known as \\"Client goes to ABCH\\" (where ABCH stands for Address Book Clearing House, the address book service behind all MSN and Windows Live services). The client must then send the contacts data to the server for it to send presence information. =MSNP14= MSNP14 adds Yahoo! Messenger interoperability. =MSNP15= MSNP15 is the protocol version introduced with Windows Live Messenger 8.1 on 2006-09-08. It is based on MSNP14 but uses a different authentication mechanism called RPS (Relying Party Suite). Where TWN \\"Tweener\\" authentication is used on protocol versions 14 and below, SSO (Single Sign-On; RPS) authentication will be used on protocol versions 15 and above. In addition to a new authentication mechanism, Microsoft is also planning on making more of the properties of the user roaming. That is, the user's display picture, and in the future personal status messages, will be the same wherever the user signs in. Furthermore, support for user locations has been added to the Personal Status Message, although this feature was later removed from the Windows Live Messenger 8.1 client. =MSNP16= MSNP16 is used in a pre-release version of Windows Live Messenger 9.0, leaked in December 2007. It features \\"Multiple Points of Presence\\" (MPOP), the ability to sign in at 2 places at the same time with having chats replicated at all places. The UUX data have been extended to contain Endpoint Data (also MPOP), as well as Signature Sound MSN Object Data. =MSNP17= MSNP17 is identified by Windows Live Messenger servers on messenger.hotmail.com, but unused by any official client released by Microsoft. =MSNP18= MSNP18 is used in Windows Live Messenger 2009 (14.0). Its main new addition is the Groups feature, much like persistent grouped conversations. UUX Data have been extended to include Scene image MSN Object data. =MSNP19= Employed by Windows Live Messenger 2011 (Wave 4) =MSNP21= Employed by Windows Live Messenger 2012 =MSNP24= Employed by Skype since early 2014.

A remastered version of All That Remains, entitled All That Remains: Reloaded, was released on March 25, 2008. It is a two-disc set that features the album and a DVD called Live in the UK.  Writing and recording  Prior to writing and recording the album, the band knew that they had their work cut out for them recording an all-original album for the first time. The band decided to record no filler material feeling every song had to be good. Rich Ward wrote all of the music and melodies while Jericho wrote the lyrics with Ed Aborn, a friend of the bands. The band recorded the album at Treesound Studios in Atlanta, and they used the same soundboard that was used on the album Synchronicity by the Police and Rush's Moving Pictures. Elton John was also in the complex at the time recording his Peachtree Road album and Alter Bridge were recording their album One Day Remains. Jericho went downstairs to Alter Bridge's studio and asked Mark Tremonti to do a guest solo on the track \\"The Way I Am\\", and Myles Kennedy laid down backing vocals. The bands producer was friends with Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman who agreed to lay down a solo for \\"Born of Anger\\". Zakk Wylde also played a solo for the song \\"Wanderlust\\". Due to conflicts between Fozzy and their record company Megaforce/Palm, the band decided to record their third effort on their own label, Ash Records.  Release and reception  The album was released January 19, 2005, and proved to be Fozzy's breakthrough album as it reached considerable commercial and critical success, mainly due to the success of their controversial lead single \\"Enemy\\". The record went on to sell little over 100,000 copies but was praised by many rock magazines. The album´s lead single \\"Enemy\\" and \\"Nameless Faceless\\" achieved moderated success with \\"Enemy\\" receiving airplay on over 80 stations across the US. \\"Enemy\\" was featured as the theme song for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE's) No Way Out pay-per-view in 2005 and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA's) Bound for Glory pay-per-view in 2006. \\"Nameless Faceless\\" reaching number 4 on the charts at XM Radio. Tour Due to the success of the album, the band embarked on a tour between February 2005 to February 2006, where they went to England, Canada, Germany, Australia and America. The band also got to play three times at the Astoria, one of the most prestigious venues in London where such popular acts like Metallica and The Beatles had once played. The band sold out the venue on all three nights. The band also took part of the 2005 Download Festival at Donington Park where they performed in front of 20,000 people and were met with positive reviews with Kerrang! magazine calling them \\"the surprise hit of the day\\".

In 1976, having been student of , she graduated from the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography aka VGIK and started working as a TV screenwriter. In 1993 she immigrated from the post Soviet Russia to America, with her son Lev Sviridov (who later won a Rhodes Scholarship while a student at the City College of New York). She wrote scenarios for about 20 films and wrote over 500 essays. Prior to leaving Russia, she wrote the scenario and co- directed (with Andrey Yerastov) the Russian language film \\"Varlam Shalamov. Several of My Lives\\" (\\"Варлам Шаламов. Несколько моих жизней\\" ) (1991)An article about Sviridova, Radio Liberty about Varlam Shalamov, an author of a collection of short stories about his experience in Gulag labor camps. In 1986 she wrote the screenplay for a short animated film called \\"One Doll's Story\\" \\"История одной куклы\\" directed by Boris Ablymin about the Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp.

She also produced Twelve one-hour shows for Russian television called \\"Top Secret\\". They dealt with such topics as Boris Pasternak's personal letters and manuscripts that were held by the KGB for thirty years, the Central Committee's secret files on the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, and former KGB agents who were serving as President Yeltsin's advisers or were lodged in other high positions. Twelve documentaries were on the top of the rating charts when they were shown during the period between March 1992 and April 1993. For several years she worked for Survivors of the SHOAH Visual History Foundation, Founder and Chair: Steven Spielberg. She left in protest when it departed from the initially set goal: to record testimonies of all of the remaining survivors of the Holocaust (the work was stopped after collecting about 55,000 interviews, with 25,000 letters with apologies sent to people left unrecorded ). She and other journalists claimed that while in the United States, they were not free to write truly independently.How independent is Russian-language media in the United States?

It is also known as the Dolomite High Route 1. It passes through some of the finest scenery in the Dolomites. The path runs south from Pragser Wildsee, near Toblach, to Belluno. Prags can be accessed by bus, and Belluno has both train and bus services. This is the classic high route in the Dolomites, and also the easiest. It gets slightly more difficult as it goes south, but the only section which might present difficulties is the descent from Schiara, and this can be bypassed. About 10–15 days are required to complete the full route. A typical day on the route might involve about seven hours walking, with ascents and descents of about 800 metres. It can be attempted during the period July to September, when the route should be largely free of snow. The route is signposted by dark blue triangles with an inset number one.

Walking the path  Camping is forbidden along the route, but there is ample accommodation available in mountain refuges and in valley hotels. There are refuges all along the route. During August advance booking is essential. The Alta Via 1 passes by several Via Ferrata, but none are incorporated in the route, and no special climbing equipment is required. The highest point on the route is Monte Lagazuoi at 2,750 metres. There is a large refuge on Monte Lagazuoi which has a restaurant and accommodation for 69 people. The route from Monte Lagazuoi descends to Falzarego Pass and then continues south. There is a cable car from the Refugio Lagazuoi to the Falzarego Pass, but a better way to descend would be through the Via Ferrata Lagazuoi Tunnels. This is a World War I tunnel which runs down through the mountain. It is also possible to descend via the Kaiserjaeger Trail and the Martini Ledge. This route passes a number of relics of the fighting that took place here during World War I. The area around Monte Lagazuoi and 5 Torri is a World War I open-air museum. There are a number of other high-level routes in the Dolomites, including the Alta Via 2, which runs from Brixen to Feltre.

LeRoy Lad Panek, After Sherlock Holmes: The Evolution of British and American Detective Stories, 1891–1914.McFarland, 2014. (pp. 66-7). He was educated at St Albans School, Merchant Taylors' School, and Caius College, Cambridge. A clubman, journalist and dandy (Lord Northcliffe admired his 'fancy vests'), he frequented both Fleet Street and The Savage Club. Pemberton was the editor of boys' magazine Chums in 1892–1893 during its heyday. Between 1896 and 1906 he also edited Cassell's Magazine (see ), in which capacity he published the early works of R. Austin Freeman and William Le Queux. His most famous work The Iron Pirate was a best-seller during the early 1890s and it launched his prolific writing career (see below). It was the story of a great gas-driven iron-clad, which could outpace the navies of the world and terrorised the Atlantic Ocean. Other notable works included Captain Black (1911). Pemberton's 1894 collection Jewel Mysteries: From a Dealer's Note Book was a series of Mystery stories revolving around stolen jewels. Pemberton also wrote historical fiction. Pemberton's I Crown Thee King is set in Sherwood Forest during the time of Mary I. Jonathan Nield, A Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales. London, E. Mathews & Marrot, 1929 (p.151). His novels Beatrice of Venice (1904) and Paulina (1922) centre on Napoleon's military campaigns in Italy.Daniel D. McGarry, Sarah Harriman White, Historical Fiction Guide: Annotated Chronological, Geographical, and Topical List of Five Thousand Selected Historical Novels. Scarecrow Press, 1963 (p.221) During January 1908, Pemberton had a story entitled Wheels of Anarchy published by Cassell & Company (London). This story was based upon notes that were written by his friend Bertram Fletcher Robinson shortly before he died in January 1907. It is an adventure tale about anarchists and assassins that is set across Europe. The novel's hero and narrator, Bruce Driscoll, a recent Cambridge graduate, appears to be modelled upon Fletcher Robinson. Wheels of Anarchy by Max Pemberton was republished in December 2010. Pemberton was member of a criminology literary society known as 'Our Society' along with eleven other notable members including Bertram Fletcher Robinson and Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1920, Pemberton founded the London School of Journalism, wrote a biography about Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe and was knighted. He was married to Alice Tussaud, granddaughter of Madame Marie Tussaud and daughter of Joseph Tussaud. Pemberton also wrote a biography of Sir Henry Royce published in 1934 shortly after Royce's death.

The population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 13,482. History Crown House, Millfields Road Historically part of Staffordshire, Ettingshall was mentioned as an ancient manor in the Domesday Book of 1086. The surrounding areas of Priestfield, Parkfield, Lanesfield and Millfields are believed to have been property of the manor. From the 18th century onwards, Ettingshall became heavily industrialised as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Until April 1979, an area of wasteland on the southside of Millfields Road was the location of the Bilston Steelworks and old Bilston quarries. Ettingshall Road was the location for Cables and Instruments, Dixon's Wallcoverings and Tools and Machines. Spring Road is the location of Tarmac Limited and John Thompson Limited. Ettingshall was the location for the manufacture of the 240 ton boiler drum with a length of 122 feet in 1965. This was the heaviest load carried by British Rail. It was transported to Eggborough in Yorkshire. Geography It is situated 1¼ miles to the south- east of the city centre and centred on the A4039 and A4126 roads. It is situated on the western edge of the former Borough of Bilston and began as an expansion of the Sedgley village of Ettingshall in the Victorian era, becoming part of the new Coseley Urban District Council in 1897. As the northern parts of the original Ettingshall extended across the border into Bilston, many new houses and factories were built and this area became known as \\"Ettingshall New Village\\", the Ettingshall that still exists in the present day. In 1966, the bulk of the old Ettingshall village was absorbed into the borough of Wolverhampton, along with parts of Brierley village, while most of the rest of Coseley - along Brierley Hill and the bulk of neighbouring Sedgley- was incorporated into an expanded Dudley borough. A few references to the original village in Sedgley still exist, with the Ettingshall Park Estate below the eastern slopes of Sedgley Beacon, while two roads in Coseley, Upper Ettingshall Road and Ettingshall Road still remain, their names reflecting the upper and lower parts of the extensive village. Ettingshall ward stretches between the city centre and Bilston, bordering the East Park, Bilston North, Bilston East, Spring Vale, Blakenhall and St Peter's wards. As well as Ettingshall, it covers the inner city area of All Saints. It forms part of the Wolverhampton South East constituency. Transport The West Midlands Metro tramway has two stops in the area: The Royal (named after the now-closed Royal Wolverhampton Hospital) and Priestfield. The nearest railway station is Wolverhampton, although the area was served by Ettingshall Road on the Stour Valley Line until the station closed in 1964. The area is well served by buses with connections to Sedgley, Wolverhampton, Willenhall and Bilston.

Howard Harris attended Fordham University School of Law for two years which, according to his family, he hated. The summer before his third and final year he got a job writing humorous anecdotes about celebrities for a trade publication. After that experience he dropped out of law school and started writing comedy for radio for Joe Penner and Fred Allen, among others, according to one account from his family. Before the Second World War, Harris moved to Hollywood where he was considered one of the hottest comedy writers around, according to his wife Marion Harris Linden. In 1943 he was a screenwriter for Higher and Higher starring Frank Sinatra (see ). In 1947 he was a co-writer for Alfred E. Green's Copacabana. Also in 1947 Harris wrote the story for a comedy called Linda Be Good, according to the Internet Movie Database (). IMDb also reports that Harris was a writer for The Noose Hangs High (), which starred Abbott and Costello. Harris migrated to television and back to New York where he became a comedy writer in 1952 for The Jackie Gleason Show in which he helped to write a segment which featured Gleason as a loud-mouthed, Brooklyn bus driver known as Ralph Kramden. That segment later became the seed for the comedy series, The Honeymooners. While in New York City in 1953, Harris appeared as a guest on What's My Line?, hosted by John Charles Daly and produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman. The celebrity panel failed to identify Harris as \\"Jackie Gleason's Gag Writer.\\" That episode is available for viewing at The Museum of Television & Radio () in New York City. Harris returned to Hollywood where he wrote a pilot episode for a half-hour show called Bozo the Clown, starring William Bendix (that episode also can be viewed at The Museum of Television & Radio ). In the early 1950s, Harris joined Groucho Marx again as a writer for the archetypal comedy game show, You Bet Your Life, produced by John Guedel. Harris, who joined the show in its second or third year, continued to write gags for Groucho for more than five years. Later in the mid-1960s Harris wrote for Gilligan's Island and Petticoat Junction. During his later years Harris continued to write gags but had trouble selling his work as younger comedy writers got television work, leaving older writers like Harris behind. On October 8, 1939, Harris married his first wife, Jeanne Nan Gidding, in New York. Their two children were Stephen Gidding Harris and Amy Lynn Harris. Amy Lynn Harris died in Savusavu, Fiji on September 28, 2018. After Jeanne died in 1970, Harris married the then Marion Linden in 1972. They lived in Los Angeles until Harris' death on March 22, 1986, age 74. Harris had three sisters. They were Radie Harris, a longtime gossip columnist for The Hollywood Reporter (). Radie died on February 22, 2001, at age 96. Lillian Harris Planer, a radio and screenwriter in the 1940s, died in 1990 at the age of 86 .

The pungency of those plants is due to mustard oils produced from glucosinolates when the plant material is chewed, cut, or otherwise damaged. These natural chemicals most likely contribute to plant defence against pests and diseases, and impart a characteristic bitter flavor property of cruciferous vegetables. Plants with glucosinolates Glucosinolates occur as secondary metabolites of almost all plants of the order Brassicales. Ordered in the Brassicales are for example the economically important family Brassicaceae as well as Capparaceae and Caricaceae. Outside of the Brassicales, the genera Drypetes and Putranjiva in the family Putranjivaceae, and the Nasturtium Tropaeolum majus, are the only other known occurrence of glucosinolates. Glucosinolates occur in various edible plants such as cabbage (white cabbage, Chinese cabbage, broccoli), Brussels sprouts, watercress, horseradish, capers, and radishes where the breakdown products often contribute a significant part of the distinctive taste. The glucosinolates are also found in seeds of these plants. Chemistry Glucosinolates constitute a natural class of organic compounds that contain sulfur and nitrogen and are derived from glucose and an amino acid. They are water-soluble anions and belong to the glucosides. Every glucosinolate contains a central carbon atom, which is bound via a sulfur atom to the thioglucose group and via a nitrogen atom to a sulfate group (making a sulfated aldoxime). In addition, the central carbon is bound to a side group; different glucosinolates have different side groups, and it is variation in the side group that is responsible for the variation in the biological activities of these plant compounds. The essence of glucosinolate chemistry is their ability to convert into an isothiocyanate (a \\"mustard oil\\") upon hydrolysis of the thioglucoside bond by the enzyme myrosinase. The semisystematic naming of glucosinolates consists of the chemical name of the aforementioned side group followed by \\"(-)glucosinolate\\". The spelling of a glucosinolate name as one word or two (e.g. allylglucosinolate versus allyl glucosinolate) has the same meaning, and both spellings are in use. But isothiocyanates must be spelled as two words. The following are some glucosinolates and their isothiocyanate products: * Allylglucosinolate (sinigrin) is the precursor of allyl isothiocyanate * Benzylglucosinolate (Glucotropaeolin) is the precursor of benzyl isothiocyanate * Phenethylglucosinolate (Gluconasturtiin) is the precursor of phenethyl isothiocyanate * (R)-4-(methylsulfinyl)butylglucosinolate (Glucoraphanin) is the precursor of (R)-4-(methylsulfinyl)butyl isothiocyanate (sulforaphane) * (R)-2-hydroxybut-3-enylglucosinolate (progoitrin) is probably the precursor of (S)-2-hydroxybut-3-enyl isothiocyanate, which is expected to be unstable and immediately cyclize to form (S)-5-vinyloxazolidine-2-thione (goitrin) Biochemistry =Natural diversity from a few amino acids= About 132 different glucosinolates are known to occur naturally in plants. They are synthesized from certain amino acids: So-called aliphatic glucosinolates derived from mainly methionine, but also alanine, leucine, isoleucine, or valine. (Most glucosinolates are actually derived from chain- elongated homologues of these amino acids, e.g. glucoraphanin is derived from dihomomethionine, which is methionine chain-elongated twice). Aromatic glucosinolates include indolic glucosinolates, such as glucobrassicin, derived from tryptophan and others from phenylalanine, its chain-elongated homologue homophenylalanine, and sinalbin derived from tyrosine. =Enzymatic activation= The plants contain the enzyme myrosinase, which, in the presence of water, cleaves off the glucose group from a glucosinolate. The remaining molecule then quickly converts to an isothiocyanate, a nitrile, or a thiocyanate; these are the active substances that serve as defense for the plant. Glucosinolates are also called mustard oil glycosides. The standard product of the reaction is the isothiocyanate (mustard oil); the other two products mainly occur in the presence of specialised plant proteins that alter the outcome of the reaction. A mustard oil glycoside 1 is converted to an isothiocyanate 3 (mustard oil). Glucose 2 is liberated as well, only the β-form is shown.– R = allyl, benzyl, 2-phenylethyl etc. In the chemical reaction illustrated above, the red curved arrows in the left side of figure are simplified compared to reality, as the role of the enzyme myrosinase is not shown. However, the mechanism shown is fundamentally in accordance with the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. In contrast, the reaction illustrated by red curved arrows at the right side of the figure, depicting the rearrangement of atoms resulting in the isothiocyanate, is expected to be non-enzymatic. This type of rearrangement can be named a Lossen-rearrangement, or a Lossen-like rearrangement, since this name was first used for the analogous reaction leading to an organic isocyanate (R-N=C=O). To prevent damage to the plant itself, the myrosinase and glucosinolates are stored in separate compartments of the cell or in different cells in the tissue, and come together only or mainly under conditions of physical injury. Biological effects =Humans and other mammals= Toxicity The use of glucosinolate-containing crops as primary food source for animals can have negative effects if the concentration of glucosinolate is higher than what is acceptable for the animal in question, because some glucosinolates have been shown to have toxic effects (mainly as goitrogens and anti-thyroid agents) in both humans and animals at high doses. However, tolerance level to glucosinolates varies even within the same genus (e.g. Acomys cahirinus and Acomys russatus). Taste and eating behavior The glucosinolate sinigrin, among others, was shown to be responsible for the bitterness of cooked cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. Glucosinolates may alter animal eating behavior.Samuni-Blank, M; Izhaki, I; Dearing, MD; Gerchman, Y; Trabelcy, B; Lotan, A; Karasov, WH; Arad, Z (2012). Intraspecific directed deterrence by the mustard oil bomb in a desert plant. Current Biology. 22:1-3. Research Glucosinolates are studied for their potential to affect plant breeding, plant physiology, plant genetics, and food applications. , preliminary research was underway to assess possible protective effects of glucosinolates against cancer and dementia. =Insects= Glucosinolates and their products have a negative effect on many insects, resulting from a combination of deterrence and toxicity. In an attempt to apply this principle in an agronomic context, some glucosinolate- derived products can serve as antifeedants, i.e., natural pesticides. In contrast, the diamondback moth, a pest of cruciferous plants, may recognize the presence of glucosinolates, allowing it to identify the proper host plant. Indeed, a characteristic, specialised insect fauna is found on glucosinolate- containing plants, including butterflies, such as large white, small white, and orange tip, but also certain aphids, moths, such as the southern armyworm, sawflies, and flea beetles. For instance, the large white butterfly deposits its eggs on these glucosinolate-containing plants, and the larvae survive even with high levels of glucosinolates and eat plant material containing glucosinolates. The whites and orange tips all possess the so-called nitrile specifier protein, which diverts glucosinolate hydrolysis toward nitriles rather than reactive isothiocyanates. In contrast, the diamondback moth possesses a completely different protein, glucosinolate sulfatase, which desulfates glucosinolates, thereby making them unfit for degradation to toxic products by myrosinase. Other kinds of insects (specialised sawflies and aphids) sequester glucosinolates. In specialised aphids, but not in sawflies, a distinct animal myrosinase is found in muscle tissue, leading to degradation of sequestered glucosinolates upon aphid tissue destruction. This diverse panel of biochemical solutions to the same plant chemical plays a key role in the evolution of plant-insect relationships.

It was rush-released by Island Records to commemorate the band, who had broken up in April 1971. Possibly because of the publicity caused by their breakup (which had also earned them a successful parting single \\"My Brother Jake\\" that same month) the album was a hit, reaching #4 in the UK album charts. It fared less well in the United States however, reaching only #89. Recording The album (including the extra tracks) was recorded from gigs played in the UK at both The Lacarno, Sunderland (January 1970) and Croydon's Fairfield Halls (September 1970), both places where Free had strong followings. Engineer Andy Johns could only use two tracks from the Sunderland gig (\\"The Hunter\\" and \\"All Right Now\\"), but used crowd noise from it frequently to create seamless links between tracks. With increased re-mastering technology available it has been possible to make others ready for the CD reissue, along with some alternate takes of tracks recorded at the second of the two Croydon sessions that were recorded. Many of the tracks on the album are from their debut Tons of Sobs (1968), as that album's rock-oriented ethos and uncomplicated production values made its material ideal for performing live. Track listing * All tracks written by Andy Fraser & Paul Rodgers unless otherwise stated: =Original tracks= #\\"All Right Now\\" – 6:24 #\\"I'm a Mover\\" – 3:46 #\\"Be My Friend\\" – 5:56 #\\"Fire and Water\\" – 3:56 #\\"Ride on Pony\\" – 4:30 (\\"Ride on a Pony\\" on the back of the CD reissue, but \\"Ride on Pony\\" on the cover of both the original LP and the CD) #\\"Mr. Big\\" (Andy Fraser, Simon Kirke, Paul Kossoff, Paul Rodgers) – 6:13 #\\"The Hunter\\" (Booker T. Jones, C. Wells, Al Jackson, Jr., Donald Dunn, Steve Cropper) – 5:29 #\\"Get Where I Belong\\" – 4:19 With the exception of one song, all performances are versions of album tracks. It begins with \\"All Right Now\\", which lasts for over six minutes. Rodgers's voice noticeably falters for a second during this song and Kossoff’s guitar is experiencing difficulties, showing how the album has not been altered in any way to remove such glitches as many modern live albums are. These are followed by loud, guitar-driven versions of \\"Be My Friend\\", \\"Fire and Water\\", \\"Ride on a Pony\\" and \\"Mr. Big\\". The live part then closes with one of the band's most popular tracks, \\"The Hunter\\" which receives a greater reaction from the crowd than any other song, including \\"All Right Now\\". Only the initial arrival of the band on stage at the very beginning causes a louder cheer. The album then closes with \\"Get Where I Belong\\", the last of four studio tracks recorded by the band before they split (the other three songs surfaced in some form on Highway (1970) and information on them is contained in that album's article). It is a slow, mellow, acoustic song much like a large part of Highway was, and sounds completely unlike any of the live songs on this album. =Extra tracks= The CD reissue contains many tracks not featured on the original 1971 LP release. These include \\"Woman\\" and a more rock-based version of \\"Trouble on Double Time\\" both of which are from Free (1969), nothing of which was featured on the main album itself. There are also live versions of \\"Walk in My Shadow\\" (considerably slower than the version on Tons of Sobs) and \\"Moonshine\\", which lasts for over nine minutes. The extra tracks also contain alternate live takes of \\"All Right Now\\" and \\"Mr. Big\\". The album closes with an alternative studio version of \\"Get Where I Belong\\", which is notable for Rodgers forgetting a line and having to hum a later one in order to regain his correct place.

Established as a joint venture between the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and the Swedish state-owned SJ, Linx operated the routes from Oslo, Norway, to Stockholm, Sweden, and from Oslo via Gothenburg, Sweden, to Copenhagen, Denmark. Services were provided up to ten times per day. However, slow speeds caused by curvy infrastructure in Norway, combined with competition from low-cost airlines, caused the company to lose money, and eventually grounded operations. The services were taken over by NSB and SJ. The main rolling stock were eleven X2 electric multiple units, although it used SJ Rc-hauled trains on the Gothenburg–Oslo service. The company was based in Gothenburg. History Linx X2 train at Malmö Central Station Linx was established following an informal agreement between the ministers of transport in Norway, Sweden and Denmark to establish high-speed rail connection between the countries' capitals. Linx was the train operating part of the agreement, while the governments would have to invest in better rail infrastructure to allow higher speeds. The company was introduced by NSB and SJ on 12 May 2000. The stated plans were to start with the service from Gothenburg to Copenhagen in January 2001, from Oslo to Gothenburg in June, and from Oslo to Stockholm in January 2002. The company would have its head office in Gothenburg and would lease rolling stock from SJ. NSB's chief executive officer, Osmund Ueland, became the company's first chair. The company had a share capital of 10 million Swedish krona (SEK) and was owned in equal shares by NSB and SJ. The company's first train ran on 7 January, from Gothenburg to Copenhagen. Service from Oslo to Gothenburg started on 17 June. Because Linx was only to operate profitable routes, it was decided that the company not take over the night train service from Oslo to Copenhagen. NSB stated that they wanted all inter-Scandinavian passenger transport to be operated by the new company, and therefore decided to terminate the night train as of September 2. Although the night trains were filled during the summer and parts of the winter, there was a low ridership during the rest of the year. However, it was a lack of engineers that forced NSB to terminate the night train service as of 20 June. There were protests against the ending of the service, particularly in Norway. Marketing Director Øyvind Rørslett of Linx stated that \\"we are concentrating on the day trains. We want to develop a holistic concept, where new modern trains are a major part. Night trains do not fit into this concept\\". X2 trains were never introduced on the section from Gothenburg to Oslo. Linx stated that investments for NOK 2 billion were needed on the Østfold Line to reach a travel time from Oslo to Gothenburg of 3 hours and 30 minutes, rather than the more than 4 hours at the time. In contrast, the Norway/Vänern Line on the Swedish side of the border meets the necessary standards. The first service from Oslo to Stockholm ran on 16 June 2002. Initially there were only three daily services, but later that year, two more daily services were introduced. At the same time, travel time was reduced by 20 minutes, as the trains stopped at only three intermediate stations. Linx operated with different prices on the same route, depending on if the ticket was bought in Norway or Sweden. The company stated that this was in part because of a strong Norwegian krone, in part because Norwegians were willing to pay more, and in part because the sales system in Sweden was more automated. Linx X2 unit at Stockholm Central Station In July 2003, Linx reduced the number of daily services from Gothenburg to Copenhagen from ten to four. The company stated that this was because of insufficient ridership. Linx had offered tickets with a lower price than Scandinavian Airlines, who operated the airline service between Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Stockholm- Arlanda Airport. Ryanair also provided an airline service, but with fewer departures and with the same center-to-center transport time because it flew from the secondary Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. From 1 September 2003, Norwegian Air Shuttle started services from Gardermoen to Arlanda, and became a more direct competitor to Linx. From 27 October, Nordic Airlink (later FlyNordic) also started a flight between the same airports. With shorter travel time from center to center and comparable fares, Norwegian and Nordic started taking market shares away from Linx. Starting on December 15, NSB took over three of the daily services from Oslo to Gothenburg, by extending three of the InterCity services along the Østfold Line onwards from Halden Station to Gothenburg. On 24 January 2004, a Linx train derailed at Vestby Station on the Østfold Line. None of the 50 passengers were hurt in the incident. On 11 June 2004, NSB and SJ stated that they would discontinue Linx, and would operate the last train on 31 December 2004. The company had never made a profit, and the new low-cost airlines had reduced ridership by up to 40%. The only part of the service which was profitable was the service from Stockholm to Karlstad, which SJ intended to continue. NSB stated that if a new Oslo–Stockholm service was to be introduced, it would require state grants. In September, SJ's CEO Jan Forsberg stated that the problems lay with the infrastructure in Norway. While the speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in Sweden and to Copenhagen, the slow lines in Norway made services to Norway unprofitable. Linx had by then transported 1.3 million passengers, and Forsberg stated that had the company transported 1.7 million people, it would have been profitable. The closing was criticized by two engineers, who stated that the company actually made a profit, but ended up paying 24% of their revenue in ticket commission to SJ and NSB. In 2003, the company had a revenue of SEK 426.8 million, of which SEK 411 million was from ticket sales. The company had a deficit of SEK 33.8 million, of which NSB covered SEK 8.1 million and SJ SEK 25.6 million. However, NSB took a commission of SEK 10.8 million and SJ SEK 58.5 million. This gave a profit, before provisions, of SEK 35.5 million. In comparison, Narvesen took a commission of 2.7% for tickets sold by NSB. The closing of the Oslo–Stockholm service was the first time there was not a train service between the capitals since 1871, when the line opened. In addition, the service cut occurred at the same time as the centennial of the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. On 4 November, SJ and NSB stated that they would continue the service, but only on weekends. They stated that an increased service would either require financial grants from the states, or introduction of duty-free sales on board. Service Interior of a Linx X2 train Travel time from Oslo to Stockholm was 4 hours and 30 minutes, with stops at Oslo Central Station, Lillestrøm Station, Kongsvinger Station, Karlstad Central Station, and Stockholm Central Station. When the service was launched, a ticket from Oslo to Stockholm cost NOK 563, or NOK 326 if bought at least seven days before departure. Two people under the age of 16 could travel for free when accompanying an adult. Later, minimum prices of NOK 280 were launched, while maximum price for business class was NOK 1300. Tickets were slightly cheaper to purchase in Sweden than in Norway. About 185,000 passengers took the train from Oslo to Stockholm each year. Travel time from Gothenburg to Copenhagen was 3 hours and 30 minutes. The X2 trains had a speed of up to on the West Coast Line from Gothenburg Central Station to Malmö Central Station, and then ran along the Öresund Line via Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup Station to Copenhagen Central Station. A ticket from Gothenburg to Copenhagen cost NOK 1119 in business class, NOK 803 in second class, and with reduced prices down to NOK 342 if bought in advance or for weekend travel. Travel time from Oslo to Gothenburg was slightly more than four hours. Prices varied from NOK 633 for a business class ticket, NOK 355 for a second class ticket to NOK 187 for pre-booked tickets. X2 trains were never introduced on the section from Oslo to Gothenburg. Instead, conventional Swedish trains from the 1960s hauled by Rc locomotives were used. Passengers traveling from Oslo to Copenhagen had to change train in Gothenburg. Rolling stock On the sections Oslo–Stockholm and Gothenburg–Copenhagen, Linx operated X2 electric multiple units owned by SJ. Forty-three units were delivered to SJ by Kalmar Verkstad between 1990 and 1997. The trains are standard gauge, have a power output of and a maximum speed of . Each train consists of a locomotive, a number of middle cars and an end car. The trains use power supply in Sweden and Norway, and 25 kV 50 Hz AC in Denmark. Linx had two classes: business and second. On business class, a warm meal and drink was included, while in second class, a restaurant car was provided. Seats had a power outlet for laptops, and free wireless Internet.

The ACCC has fifteen parishes and missions; with two bishops and 22 clergy. Affiliation The Anglican Catholic Church of Canada is one of the churches that trace their origins to the Congress of St. Louis, the assembly that inaugurated the Continuing Anglican Movement and produced the Affirmation of St. Louis. The new church adopted the name, \\"Anglican Catholic Church.\\" Its Canadian diocese shortly thereafter asked for and received a release from that body in order to become a self-governing Canadian church offering a traditional alternative to the more liberal Anglican Church of Canada. The Anglican Catholic Church of Canada is a founding member of the Traditional Anglican Communion (TAC), established in 1990. The ACCC is the third-largest of the Anglican churches in Canada, after the ACC and the Anglican Church in North America. Traditional worship and morality The founding members of the Anglican Catholic Church of Canada were dissatisfied with decisions made by the Anglican Church of Canada (ACC) to confer priestly ordination upon women and to make liturgical reforms that would evolve into the Book of Alternative Services. The ACCC continues to maintain an all-male clergy and recently has criticised what it considers to be the parent church's increasing acceptance of homosexuality. The church uses the 1962 Book of Common Prayer exclusively and rejects the possibility of remarriage after divorce. Structure The ACCC has parishes and missions throughout Canada. Most ACCC congregations are small, but the church continues to experience growth, particularly in the larger centres. The first bishop of the ACCC was Bishop Carmino de Catanzaro, who served until his death. The successive bishops, in order, were Bishop Alfred Woolcock, Bishop Robert Mercer, and Bishop Peter Wilkinson. In March 2013, the Very Reverend Shane Janzen was consecrated fifth diocesan and metropolitan bishop in Victoria, British Columbia. On November 1, 2014, the ACCC created two dioceses, one for the Western Canada (Diocese of Canada West) and one for the East (Diocese of Canada East), each with its own Bishop Ordinary. Proposed ordinariate within the Roman Catholic Church Until 2012, the TAC discussed a form of union with the Roman Catholic Church and stated that it had no doctrinal differences with Rome sufficient to prevent the success of this proposal.Rome and the TAC In October 2009, the ACCC welcomed an initiative from Pope Benedict XVI to create personal ordinariates for Anglicans.Anglicans welcome Pope's overture On March 12, 2010, the ACCC formally requested the erection of an ordinariate in Canada.The petition to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Subsequent to the petition, seven of thirty-five parish groups (one fifth) removed themselves from the ACCC. To provide a means for some clergy and laity to join the Roman Catholic Church, in November 2011 the ACCC divided into two non-geographical dioceses: the original Diocese of Canada (for parishes and individuals not entering the ordinariate) and the Pro-Diocese of Our Lady of Walsingham (for parishes and individuals entering the ordinariate). On April 15, 2012, Bishop Peter Wilkinson and Bishop Carl Reid resigned their episcopal office and orders, and were received into the Roman Catholic Church as laymen. Bishop Craig Botterill became apostolic administrator until the election of the new diocesan bishop, the Right Reverend Shane Janzen, in November 2012. The remaining Diocese of Canada explicitly stated that it \\"will remain an Anglican church\\" and not enter the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter.

He did his postdoctoral studies abroad, at the Children's Memorial Hospital of Chicago, United States. In 1988, he accepted an appointment as an associate professor of pediatrics at the same school. He wrote seven books and hundreds of specialized papers, articles and columns in the general press. Among his works are a series of books on the plights of physical abuse, rape, accidents and abandonment of children, published between 1986 and 1995. Political career Dr. Santos became a public figure in the 1980s, when he founded and directed the Regional Center for Care of Maltreatment in Infancy (CRAMI - Centro Regional para a Atenção aos Maus Tratos na Infância), a highly praised philanthropic effort in Campinas county. On the basis of his work, he was appointed Municipal Secretary of Health of Hortolândia, a city near Campinas (1993–1996) and Municipal Secretary of Health of Americana (in 1997). He was elected a federal congressman by São Paulo in 1999, and re-elected in 2003. His first attempt at winning a mayoral election was in 2001, but he lost to majority candidates Carlos Sampaio and Antonio Costa. In his second run, he was elected with 258,456 votes, 52.63% of all valid votes in Campinas, the second largest electoral college in the state. He is the first Afro-Brazilian to be elected mayor of that city. In 2011, Dr. Santos was impeached from his position as mayor of Campinas, after an administrative process installed by the City Council, after accusations of fraud and corruption. His wife was arrested by the federal police and handcuffed in the morning when proceedings began. Works * Cirurgia ambulatorial em pediatria. São Paulo: Panamed, 1986. 116 p. * Crianças espancadas.

Literally, montuno means 'comes from the mountain', and so son montuno may refer to the older type of son played in the mountainous rural areas of Oriente. Another possibility is that the word montuno comes from the word montura, the Spanish word for \\"saddle\\", because the rhythm in son music is like riding a horse. Or it may mean the final section of a song-based composition; in this sense it is simply part of a piece of music. Here it is usually a faster, brasher, semi-improvised instrumental section, sometimes with a repetitive vocal refrain.

It is situated SSE of the city centre, on the city's border with the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. The population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 12,243. Geography As well as Dudley, Spring Vale borders the Blakenhall, Ettingshall and Bilston East wards, and forms part of the Wolverhampton South East constituency. It contains the suburbs of Ettingshall Park, Woodcross (which is actually part of the Bilston township) and Lanesfield. History The area has seen some regeneration in recent years, as a result of the close of the Bilston Steel Works in 1979 by British Steel Corporation. The works were a major employer for the area and the location where the first Bessemer blast furnace was installed, which allowed the invention of Tarmac using burnt coal residue. The closure of works resulted in the loss of 2,000 and the surrounding communities all witnessed a rise in unemployment and significant damage to their local economies. Places of interest In 1994, Blue Lamp and Tarmac Industries developed the land building Springvale Retail Park, providing new employment to local people. In 1995, Blue Lamp Business Parks Ltd. commissioned a landmark sculpture called 'Roll Down', designed and created by sculptor Robert Erskine FRBS. 'Roll Down' stands on the exact location of where the number 1 Bessemer Blast Furnace, known as Elizabeth to the steel workers, was sited. At a height of and wide, 'Roll Down' is made of wrought stainless steel. It was nominated for the Anderson Sculpture Prize. The sculpture was unveiled on 19 October 1994 by Labour MP Dennis Turner, who had worked as a steelman at the Elizabeth blast furnace. Past steel workers were invited to the ceremony and reception. 250 children from the Springvale Primary school adjacent to the sculpture, buried memory capsules beneath the sculpture. This was after a tour organised by Robert Erskine to the works in Derby where he was creating 'Roll Down', and involved the children in the project. The capsules contain poignant stories of the children's families experiencing unemployment, but also messages of thought for the future. Many children provided precious artifacts and objects from their relatives, which in time will be revealed and preserved for future generations. 'Roll Down' is designed to last a minimum of 500 years. Also located in the ward is Spring Vale Library on Bevan Avenue.

This species, usually called NaHMDS (sodium hexamethyldisilazide), is a strong base used for deprotonation reactions or base-catalyzed reactions. Its advantages are that it is commercially available as a solid and it is soluble not only in ethers, such as THF or diethyl ether, but also in aromatic solvents, like benzene and toluene by virtue of the lipophilic TMS groups.Watson, B. T.; Lebel, H. \\"Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. NaHMDS is quickly destroyed by water to form sodium hydroxide and bis(trimethylsilyl)amine. Structure Although the N-Na bond is polar covalent as a solid, when dissolved in nonpolar solvents this compound is trimeric, consisting of a central Na3N3 ring. Applications in synthesis NaHMDS is used as a base in organic synthesis. Typical reactions: *To deprotonate ketones and esters to generate enolate derivatives. *Generate carbenes by dehydrohalogenation of halocarbons. These carbene reagents add to alkenes to give substituted cyclopropanes and cyclopropenes. *To deprotonation of phosphonium salts, generating Wittig reagents. NaHMDS is also used as a base to deprotonate other compounds containing weakly acidic O-H, S-H, and N-H bonds. These include cyanohydrins and thiols.

Bacon, \\"Budget woes may force Army to close bases\\", The Town Talk, May 16, 2013, p. 1 Fort Polk began as a base for the Louisiana Maneuvers in the 1940s. It served the 1st Armored Division in the 1950s, and became a basic training post during Vietnam War years of the 1960s and '70s. It hosted the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) in the 1970s-1980s, and the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in the 1990s and the 1st Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, and the 162nd Infantry Brigade in the 2000s.

Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Programhttp://www.polkhistory.org/ Polk History.org History = 1940s = = World War II = Aerial View of Camp Polk during the 1940s Construction of Camp Polk began in 1941. Thousands of wooden barracks sprang up quickly to support an Army preparing to do battle on the North African, European and Pacific fronts. Soldiers at Polk participated in the Louisiana Maneuvers, which were designed to test U.S. troops preparing for World War II. Until 1939, the Army had mostly been an infantry force with supporting artillery, engineer, and cavalry units. Few units had been motorized or mechanized. As U.S. involvement in World War II became more likely, the Army recognized the need to modernize the service. But it also needed large-scale maneuvers to test a fast-growing, inexperienced force. That is where Fort Polk and the Louisiana Maneuvers came in. The Maneuvers involved half a million soldiers in 19 Army Divisions, and took place over in August and September 1941. The troops were divided equal armies of two notional countries: Kotmk (Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Kentucky) and Almat (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee). These countries were fighting over navigation rights for the Mississippi River. The Maneuvers gave Army leadership the chance to test a new doctrine that stressed the need for both mass and mobility. Sixteen armored divisions sprang up during World War II after the lessons learned during the Louisiana Maneuvers were considered. These divisions specialized in moving huge combined-arms mechanized units long distances in combat. On the defensive front, U.S. doctrine was based on two needs: the ability to defeat Blitzkrieg tactics; and how to deal with large numbers of German tanks attacking relatively narrow areas. As such, the Maneuvers also tested the concept of the tank destroyer. In this concept, highly mobile guns were held in reserve until friendly forces were attacked by enemy tanks. Then, the tank destroyers would be rapidly deploy to the flanks of the penetration. Tank destroyers employed aggressive, high-speed hit-and- run tactics. The conclusion drawn was that tank destroyer battalions should be raised. Immediately after the war, the battalions were disbanded and the anti- tank role was taken over by the Infantry, Engineer and Armor branches.A Soldier' Place in History.

The first prisoners of war (POWs), who began arriving in Louisiana in July 1943, were from the Afrika Korps, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's troops who fought in North Africa. They were housed in a large fenced-in compound in the area now encompassing Honor Field, Fort Polk's parade ground. Finding themselves captured, transported across the ocean, and imprisoned in the middle of summer was made to hurt their spirits. In his book Up Front, author Bill Mauldin noted that it was more practical to ship prisoners to camps in the U.S. on otherwise empty troop ships returning from the ETO, housing and feeding them in the U.S. where escape was far less likely, rather than further burdening outbound cargo ships with provisions for prisoners in camps based in Europe. He added that American GIs resented the fact that German POWs were allowed to breathe the air in the U.S. while GIs were on the battlegrounds of a devastated Europe through the duration of the war, but they understood the logic of keeping the POWs in the U.S. rather than in Europe. The POWs picked cotton, cut rice, and cut lumber. They also helped sandbag the raging Red River in the summer of 1944. Prisoners were not forced to work, and some refused. Those who worked earned scrip for their labor, with which they could buy such necessities as toothpaste or snacks at their own Post Exchange. From the end of World War II until the early 1960s, the post was closed and reopened numerous times. During much of this time, it was open only in the summers to support reserve component training. Soldiers were stationed there temporarily during the Korean War and the Berlin Crisis. = 1950s =  Korea  45th Division 37th Division In August 1950, the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard became the first unit to train at Fort Polk in preparation for the Korean War. During the Korean War the 45th Infantry Division suffered 4,004 casualties; 834 killed in action and 3,170 wounded in action Varhola, Michael J. (2000). Fire and Ice: The Korean War, 1950–1953.

ISBN ASIN B000OJKX1S Most of the units who rotated through Camp Polk during 1952-54 were trained for combat by the 37th Infantry Division of the Ohio Army National Guard. Although the 37th Division itself was not sent to Korea as a unit, nearly every soldier was sent as an individual replacement. = Operation Sagebrush = In 1955, the U.S. military conducted another large training exercise that covered a substantial portion of Louisiana. Named Operation Sagebrush, the focus of this exercise was to evaluate the effectiveness of military operations in a nuclear environment. The exercise lasted for 15 days with 85,000 troops participating. A provisional army, meant to represent U.S. forces, was built around the 1st Armored Division and an opposing force was built around the 82nd Airborne Division. U.S. Air Force bombers and fighter planes also participated in this exercise with powerful aircraft operating in the sky, stirring great interest among the citizens of the region. Also participating as part of the provisional army was the 15th Infantry Regiment (actually designated as 15th Infantry Combat Command) of the 3rd Infantry Division from Fort Benning.  1st Armored Division  Upon completion of Operation Sagebrush, Camp Polk was declared a permanent installation and the 1st Armored Division was reassigned from Fort Hood to the newly renamed Fort Polk to continue to test mobility and combat strategies for the nuclear age. The 1st Armored Division, with its modern M-48 Patton Tanks and new helicopters, remained at Fort Polk until June 1959, before returning to Fort Hood. = 1960s - 1970s = = Vietnam = In 1962, Fort Polk began converting to an advanced infantry training (AIT) center. A small portion of Fort Polk is filled with dense, jungle-like vegetation, so this, along with Louisiana's heat, humidity and precipitation (similar to Southeast Asia) helped commanders acclimatize new infantry soldiers in preparation for combat in Vietnam. This training area became known as Tigerland. For the next 12 years, more soldiers were shipped to Vietnam from Fort Polk than from any other American training base. For many, Fort Polk was the only stateside Army post they saw before assignment overseas. Many soldiers reported to basic training at Fort Polk and stayed on post for infantry training at Tigerland before being assigned to infantry line companies in Vietnam. In October 1974, Fort Polk became the new home of the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), and basic training and AIT started being phased out. Fort Polk changed from a Continental Army Command (CONARC) post in July 1975 and became a Forces Command (FORSCOM) member. In the spring of 1976, the Infantry Training Center at Fort Polk closed its doors and ceased operations. The final chapter of the Vietnam War ended for Fort Polk. The Combat Engineer Battalion of the 588th lived on North Fort Polk, Louisiana. =1970s - 1980s= 5th Division With the end of the Vietnam War, Fort Polk experienced a transition from an installation focused on basic and advanced individual training to that of the home of the reactivated 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized). Activated in September 1975, the division called Fort Polk home until it was inactivated in November 1992. The date of this inactivation, November 24, 1992, was exactly 75 years from the date of the original activation of the division on November 24, 1917. The division was organized with two active duty brigades and a brigade from the Louisiana National Guard. From 1972 until 1987, Fort Polk hosted the 1st Battalion, 40th Armor Regiment. During that time 1/40th Armor participated in training exercises with the Louisiana Army National Guard and 5th Infantry Division units. It was part of the Rapid Deployment Force for the operations in Grenada, but was not deployed, instead it was reassigned to the hills nol (German Defense Plan). In 1983, the 1/40 Armor took part in the Reforger 1984 exercises in Bavaria and two deployments to the National Training Center in 1984 and 1985. The 1/40 Armor was deactivated at Fort Polk in 1987. It was reactivated as the 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry at Fort Richardson in Alaska in 2005. While at Fort Polk, the 5th Infantry Division participated in the NATO Reforger 78 and 84 Exercise in Europe and the 1989 Invasion of Panama, known as Operation Just Cause. From June 1987 to August the 95th Division (Tng) conducted basic training exercises of approximately 600 recruits. During the stay of the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Polk experienced a major building program that included new barracks, motor pools, 1000 family housing units, chapels, and dental clinics. The Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital, named after Stanhope Bayne-Jones, a modern Post Exchange, commissary, warehouses, classrooms, athletic complexes and improved gunnery ranges. Effective 21 March 1976, the 1st Battalion 61st Infantry was reactivated and once again assigned to the 5th Division at Fort Polk. = 1990s =  JRTC moves to Polk  In 1993, the Joint Readiness Training Center moved from Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, to Fort Polk, and once again, the post was called on to prepare soldiers for conflict. Each year, JRTC typically conducts several rotations for units about to deploy. During the 1990s, Fort Polk-based soldiers deployed to Haiti, Southwest Asia, Suriname, Panama, Bosnia, and other locations. Weather support for the exercise is completed by the units participating in the exercise in conjunction with the 26th Operational Weather Squadron. 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment 2nd ACR The 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment arrived at Fort Polk in 1993 as the armored cavalry regiment of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Elements of the regiment deployed to Haiti in 1995 in support of Operation Uphold Democracy and to Bosnia in 1996 in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. The 2nd ACR deployed to Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan and Djibouti in 2002 to in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, and then deployed in Iraq in 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (now known as Operation New Dawn). The Army announced on 14 May 2004, that the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment would be transformed into an Infantry- based Stryker Brigade and move to Fort Lewis, Washington. The transfer of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Polk to Fort Lewis was completed in 2006. The 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment were later moved to Vilseck, Germany. Current Units = Operations Group = 82nd Airborne Division participate in an exercise in a simulated Iraqi village at the Joint Readiness Training Center. The Joint Readiness Training Center is focused on improving unit readiness by providing highly realistic, stressful, joint and combined arms training across the full spectrum of conflict. The JRTC is one of the Army's three \\"Dirt\\" Combat Training Centers resourced to train infantry brigade task forces and their subordinate elements in the Joint Contemporary Operational Environment. With great emphasis on realism, the JRTC Operations Group provides rotational units with the opportunity to conduct joint operations which emphasize contingency force missions. The JRTC training scenario is based on each participating organization's mission essential tasks list and many of exercises are mission rehearsals for actual operations the organization is scheduled to conduct. JRTC scenarios allow complete integration of Air Force and other military services as well as host-nation and civilian role players. The exercise scenarios replicate many of the unique situations and challenges a unit may face to include host national officials and citizens, insurgents and terrorists, news media coverage and non- governmental organizations.Fort Polk, Home of Heros.

As part of the Army's transformation initiative, this organization was designed to create a highly mobile, lethal, and flexible combat unit to support the rapid buildup of combat power wherever needed across the globe. The structure of the brigade is modular and provides for organic infantry, cavalry, field artillery, maintenance, logistic and support capabilities. While stilled flagged as 4th Brigade, it deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from 2006 to 2007 then again for Operation Iraqi Freedom from December 2007 to January 2009. The brigade deployed to Afghanistan in fall 2010 and returned to the U.S. in fall 2011.

At the onset of hostilities during World War I, the unit sailed aboard the \\"S.S. Mataika,\\" departing the United States on 22 August 1918, and arriving in France 3 September 1918. Evacuation Hospital #15 earned a battle streamer for its participation in the Meuse-Argonne Forest offensive from 26 September 1918 through 11 November 1918. The hospital, having served honorably and proud during World War I, returned to the United States aboard the \\"S.S. America\\" and was demobilized at Camp Lewis, Washington on 28 June 1919. Evacuation Hospital #15 was reconstituted as the 15th Evacuation Hospital in 1936, after having been organized as an inactive unit of the Regular Army on 1 October 1933. 115th Combat Support Hospital is a deployable medical unit that provides medical specialities to the battlefield. Medical specialties provided by the 115th Combat Support Hospital include: general surgery, orthopaedics, podiatry, and physical therapy. Additional support for clinical operations is provided through a pharmacy, X-ray services, clinical laboratories, anaesthesia, and operative services. The 115th Combat Support Hospital is also staffed to provide medical command management and administrative support through an organic medical headquarters. During peacetime operations the 115th Field Hospital trains at the JRTC and Fort Polk. As a deployable medical systems hospital with the most modern equipment available, the unit is capable of being deployed in an area of operations during a contingency, war or national emergency. =U.S. Army Garrison= 75px U.S. Army Garrison provides installation support for all tenant units as well as JRTC rotational units. =Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital= 75px The Fort Polk medical facility compromises the Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital, the Wellness and Readiness Center, the Department of Behavioural Health and the United States Army Air Ambulance Detachment.

A bacteriologist and preventive medicine specialist, he achieved worldwide acclaim as the individual responsible for the control of typhus in Europe at the conclusion of World War II. National Guard The Louisiana Army National Guard maintains a maintenance facility on Fort Polk which services its major units such as the 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team and 225th Engineer Brigade. Current =Land expansion= In 2008 Fort Polk began a land expansion plan. The plan calls for the acquisition of 100,000 acres for large JRTC maneuvers and live fire operations. This will be the largest land expansion since World War II, located south and southeast of Peason Ridge, and the first parcel was purchased in 2012.

Wildlife management 105,545 acres within the post has been designated Fort Polk Wildlife Management Area. An estimated 700 to 750 horses roam training lands on and around Fort Polk. The fate of the horses has been the subject of debate since the Army proposed removing them about a year ago. Army officials say the animals represent a safety hazard, while advocates have argued they should be left alone.

On 22 August 2005, Sun announced that it was opening up Project DReaM, which had started as an internal research project, as part of their Open Media Commons initiative. It was released under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL). Due to inactivity on the project, it was closed and archived in August 2008. DReaM is an acronym that stands for \\"DRM everywhere/available\\". Project DReaM included of a Java Stream Assembly API to support digital video management and distribution, a hardware- and operating system-independent interoperable DRM standard called DRM-OPERA, and the Sun Streaming Server to stream video and audio over IP. The key characteristics of Project DReaM were as follows:dream: * Network identity focus: Project DReaM approaches DRM (and CAS) from a network identity management-focused perspective, rather than a device-centric approach. * Interoperability: Project DReaM uses an open approach and fully specifies everything necessary to build heterogeneous, interoperable, vendor neutral implementations. * No reliance on security through obscurity: Project DReaM's architecture does not follow the traditional model of security through obscurity which must maintain a closed source code base in order to operate securely. * Royalty-free design model: Project DReaM is designed to be royalty free, allowing developers to avoid encumbered technology that carries onerous licensing costs. Project DReaM technology required the software code to be signed and run on trusted computing hardware, on which unauthorized or unsigned code cannot be run. This approach was criticized by journalist Cory Doctorow, who characterized Project DReaM as crippleware. Project DReaM was favorably mentioned by Mike Linksvayer in a 2008 article discussing its support for fair use and Creative Commons- licensed content.

Facial rejuvenation can be achieved through either surgical and/or non- surgical options. Procedures can vary in invasiveness and depth of treatment. Surgical procedures can restore facial symmetry through targeted procedures and facial restructuring and skin alterations. Non-surgical procedures can target specific depths of facial structures and treat localized facial concerns such as wrinkles, skin laxity, hyperpigmentation and scars. Surgical (invasive) facial rejuvenation procedures can include a brow lift (forehead lift), eye lift (blepharoplasty), facelift (rhytidectomy), chin lift and neck lift. Non-surgical (non-invasive) facial rejuvenation treatments can include chemical peels, neuromodulator (such as botox), dermal fillers, laser resurfacing, photorejuvenation, radiofrequency and Ultrasound. Visual appraisal of facial youthfulness Human visual perception is notable for its sensitivity and accuracy in estimating our perceived age by instant pattern recognition of facial features. Often, human faces with no measurable difference in facial geometry and appearance are perceived as having different ages. This mechanism is not yet entirely understood, but there may be a relation to the subtle changes in facial bone structure related below. Golden ratio Facial symmetry has a direct relationship to perceived beauty. A guiding approach to facial rejuvenation and balancing facial symmetry is through an application of the golden ratio. Artists and architects have been using this ratio to create works that are pleasing to the eye for centuries. Aesthetic medicine and facial rejuvenation techniques has adopted this mathematical approach to facial restoration and enhancement. Influence of changes in bone structure More recent research has pointed out the influence of changes in the facial skeleton with age on the appearance of aging, especially in the mid-face area and the lower part of the orbits around the nose. Quantitative study with CAT scans of the faces of men and women in several age brackets has revealed that there is an appreciable amount of bone tissue loss in these regions with age, leading to changes in angles, lengths and volumes, and also decreasing the distance between the eyes. It has been hypothesized that skin sagging and wrinkles may occur not only because of loss of soft tissue and fat, but also because bone retraction creates an excess of skin which is no longer flexible. Many of the facial manifestations of aging reflect the combined effects of gravity, progressive bone resorption, decreased tissue elasticity, and redistribution of subcutaneous fullness. Future facial rejuvenation techniques may take into account these findings and restore bone lost by aging processes. Trends in facial rejuvenation According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, more than 133,000 facelifts and nearly 216,000 eyelid surgeries were performed in the USA in 2013, a six per cent increase from 2012. Facial rejuvenation procedures experienced the most growth, as 2013 marked the highest number of botulinum toxin type A injections to date, with 6.3 million injections. A significant upward trend on the number of facial rejuvenation procedures is predicted, and could be due to the following factors: #Men have also started to perform these procedures at increasing numbers; #Emphasis on image of youthfulness by the mass media and fashion; #Increasing numbers of senior people enjoying good health and financial affluence at older ages; #Decreasing costs of surgery and other cosmetic procedures, making them affordable to all However, while surgical procedures are still preferred to achieve a more dramatic improvement, the current trend is towards less invasive procedures, such as injectables (Botox, fillers) and laser skin treatments. While these treatments achieve temporary results, they tend to be preferred because of their reduced cost and less intensive recovery period. Procedures Facial rejuvenation procedures can include (but are not limited to): * Botox injections * Chemical peels * Collagen injection * Cosmetic acupuncture * Dermal filler injections * Electrotherapy * Facial toning * Fraxel * Microcurrent transdermal electroporation * Microdermabrasion * Photorejuvenation * Laser resurfacing * Nd:YAG laser * Permanent makeup * Platelet-rich fibrin matrix method See also * Aesthetic medicine * Cosmetic surgery * Cosmetics * Plastic surgery * Rejuvenation (aging) * Modiolus (face) References Further reading  Beauty Shortcutips.(Jan 15 2017).: Facial steaming also increases circulation and blood flow, which can help keep your skin soft and prevent aging.

Horwich Works was a railway works built in 1886 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) in Horwich, near Bolton, in North West England when the company moved from its original works at Miles Platting, Manchester. Buildings Wren, one of eight small locomotives used on the 18\\" gauge system in Horwich Works Horwich Works was built on of land bought in April 1884 for £36,000. Rivington House, the first of several workshops was long by wide and opened in February 1887. The long brick built workshops had full-height arched windows and were separated by tram and rail tracks. Work to construct the three bay, long by wide, erecting shop began in March 1885. Inside were 20 overhead cranes. An gauge railway, with approximately of track was built to carry materials around the works complex, modelled on a similar system at Crewe Works. Two small 0-4-0 tank locomotives were bought from Beyer, Peacock & Company in 1887 to haul stores trains around the site, and six more were acquired at intervals to 1901. The first of these was bought from Beyer Peacock, but the remainder were built at Horwich. From 1930 they were gradually withdrawn from service, the last, Wren, (a Beyer Peacock engine) was withdrawn in 1961 and was originally renovated and placed on display in the Erecting Shop. It is now preserved at the National Railway Museum. History = Early production = L&YR; 1008, the first locomotive built at Horwich (1889) John Ramsbottom was hired from semi-retirement by the L&YR; to advise on a new site for locomotive construction and repairs. Ramsbottom identified a greenfield site near Bolton as the most suitable, and oversaw construction of the works. The first locomotive built by the LYR at Horwich was a 2-4-2 tank engine designed by John Aspinall. This locomotive was L&YR; 1008 and is now preserved at the National Railway Museum. By 1899 a further 677 locomotives had been built, and another 220 under Henry Hoy. Between 1891 and 1900, 230 0-6-0 tender engines designed by Barton Wright were rebuilt as 0-6-0ST saddle tanks, LYR Class F16. In 1899, the Aspinall-designed 'Atlantic' 4-4-2 express passenger locomotive was introduced and forty had been completed by 1902. Horwich works produced its 1,000th engine in 1907, a four-cylinder compound 0-8-0. =LMS ownership= In 1923 when the railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), its Chief Mechanical Engineer was George Hughes. In 1926 he was responsible for the design of a 2-6-0 mixed traffic locomotive of unusual appearance, which became known as the \\"Horwich Crab.\\" The class proved extremely successful, and 245 locomotives were built, 70 at Horwich, including the first 30 examples. The \\"Crabs\\" continued in service with British Railways' London Midland and Scottish regions until the last two survivors were withdrawn in early 1967. Three of the four post-grouping railways had Chief Mechanical Engineers who had served at least part of their apprenticeship or early career at Horwich. These were George Hughes and Henry Fowler of the LMS, Richard Maunsell of the Southern, and Nigel Gresley of the London and North Eastern Railway. Aviator Alliott Verdon-Roe also went on from Horwich to found the Manchester-based Avro aeroplane company. During World War II, the works built nearly 500 Cruiser, Centaur and Matilda tanks. = Nationalisation and closure = After nationalisation in 1948, locomotive construction at Horwich continued at a high level for ten years. During 1948 twenty LMS Ivatt Class 4 tender engines were completed, twenty-seven followed in 1949, with twenty-four in 1951, followed by a single locomotive in early 1952. Between 1945 and 1950, 120 LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 tender engines were built at Horwich by the LMS (53 locos) and British Railways (67 locos). The last BR Standard design steam engine to be built was outshopped in 1957. BR continued to overhaul steam engines for several more years. The last steam locomotive (Stanier LMS 8F 2-8-0 48756) was despatched after overhaul on 4 May 1964. In October 1969 it became part of British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL). Horwich continued in use as a works for other rolling stock up until it closed in December 1983. The foundry and the spring shop continued in use after this date, although the work force was reduced from 1,400 to 300. In an effort to publicise the redevelopment of the site into small industrial units on 20 June 1985 locomotive 47491 was named Horwich Enterprise by Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport David Mitchell at Horwich Works. The site was sold by BREL to the Parkfield Group in 1988 and the rail connection to the works was removed in 1989. The site is now an industrial estate, appropriately named \\"Horwich Loco Industrial Estate\\", with most of the buildings still in use. Horwich railway station in the town centre, primarily used by employees at the works, was opened in 1887. It closed in 1965 with the last passenger train departing on 27 September 1965, hauled by 2-6-4T number 42626.Horwich Station - History . Retrieved 8 June 2010. Redevelopment The locomotive works site was designated a conservation area by Bolton Council in 2006. The site was proposed for mixed-use development in 2010 to include of land for employment and up to 1,600 houses within a timescale extending from 2013 to 2026. The proposal was adopted as council strategy in 2011, and supplementary planning guidance was released in 2012 designating part of the site for preservation. An initial planning application was approved by Bolton Council in 2016.The Bolton News, http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/bolton/15430265.REVEALED__Plans_for_the_first_112_homes_at_Horwich_Loco_Works_development/ Work began in 2018. Asbestos used to insulate steam engines and railway carriages linked to mesothelioma has been a legacy affecting former workers and their families with Asbestos dust also being carried in clothing. The redevelopment of the site required it to be cleared of contaminants before building commenced. Part of the site is planned for demolition for the creation of a link road in 2019, linking the Middlebrook Retail Park, M61 and Horwich Parkway railway station.

On October 7, 1971, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is currently a restaurant called Sichuan Garden. There was debate about using the property as a restaurant but ultimately the plans were approved as being sufficiently respectful of the historical nature of the site. The historic 1790 House was across the Middlesex Canal. History The original Baldwin House was built in 1661 by Henry Baldwin, one of Woburn's first settlers, making this building the oldest home in Woburn. In 1803 his great-grandson, noted engineer Col. Loammi Baldwin, greatly enlarged the house to its current form. (This younger Baldwin, known as the Father of American Civil Engineering, created the Middlesex Canal, and lent his name to the Baldwin apple, discovered nearby.) At that time its grounds were in extent. On the south, between the house and the canal, was formerly a beautiful garden, with walks and trees, superior to anything in the region. All traces have long since disappeared under suburban sprawl. All told, six generations of Baldwins lived in the house, as documented in John Farmer's Genealogical Register of the First Settlers of New England: Henry Baldwin from 1661 to 1697; Henry Baldwin, son of the above; then James Baldwin; Loammi Baldwin, son of James, to 1807; he put on a third story. Benjamin F. Baldwin, 1807 to 1822; Loammi, Mary, and Clarissa Baldwin, from 1822 to 1836. George R. Baldwin from 1836 to November, 1887 (or to death, October 11, 1888.) After leaving the family's ownership it became a boarding house, within which resided Baldwin family members until the 1930s, and a restaurant. The house is nearly cubical in form, three stories tall, with false ashlar front facade and clapboarding elsewhere, full-height pilasters at the corners, and a balustrade above the eaves. The entry door is ornamented with a classic pediment and lights, and further graced by an elegant Palladian window above. In West Baldwin, Maine one can see a copy of the Baldwin house built by Loammi Baldwin for Josiah Pierce also referred to as \\"Baldwin house\\". In 1971 the house was moved to its current site to make way for expansion of a supermarket shopping area, immediately adjacent to the Middlesex Canal, from its original location just west of Main Street at the Route 128 rotary (now commercial sprawl). Remnants of the canal can still be seen near the original home site and adjacent to the Showcase Cinemas parking lot.

A jumble sale, bring and buy sale (U.K, Australia) or rummage sale (U.S and Canada) is an event at which second hand goods are sold, usually by an institution such as a local Boys' Brigade Company, Scout group, or church, as a fundraising or charitable effort. A rummage sale by a church is called a church sale or white elephant sale, frequently as part of a church bazaar. United Kingdom Organisers will usually ask local people to donate goods, which are set out on tables in the same manner as at car boot sales, and sold to members of the general public, who may have to pay a fee to enter the sale. Typically in the UK the entry fee is a few pence or pounds. Jumble sales may be becoming less popular in the UK, as car boot sales and the World Wide Web enable people to sell their unwanted goods rather than donate them to charity. United States Rummage sales in the United States and Canada as a rule do not charge any entrance fee, but sometimes charge a fee, or reserve for paid members or donors access to \\"preview sales\\" before the general public is admitted. Sometimes the sponsoring organization excludes donations of certain items, such as furniture or exercise equipment, or have a sale restricted to a single type of goods, such as book sales or sports-equipment sales. Some larger churches or charities have permanent thrift stores where donated goods are offered either daily, weekly, or monthly, etc. The Salvation Army and Goodwill Industries are known for their daily-operated thrift stores, frequently located in donated space in major retail locations. Other thrift stores are either for-profit, or operated by corporations which are a charity in name only, as only a small fraction of profits are used charitably. In Canada and the U.S., the term \\"flea market\\" refers to many commercial venues where informal sales are conducted, of both second-hand and new goods by different private sellers. Frequently the sellers pay a fee to participate. Churches and other groups also sponsor flea-markets where the organization collects seller fees, and may also sell food and have its own \\"white elephant\\" or \\"rummage\\" tables or booths.

While less commonly used for research than mice, rats have served as an important animal model for research in psychology and biomedical science. Origins Rat-baiting In 18th century Europe, wild brown rats ran rampant and this infestation fueled the industry of rat-catching. Rat-catchers would not only make money by trapping the rodents, but also by selling them for food or, more commonly, for rat-baiting. Rat-baiting was a popular sport, which involved filling a pit with rats and timing how long it took for a terrier to kill them all. Over time, breeding the rats for these contests may have produced variations in color, notably the albino and hooded varieties. The first time one of these albino mutants was brought into a laboratory for a study was in 1828 for an experiment on fasting. Over the next 30 years, rats were used for several more experiments and eventually the laboratory rat became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific reasons. Two hooded rats In Japan, there was a widespread practice of keeping rats as a domesticated pet during the Edo period and in the 18th century guidebooks on keeping domestic rats were published by Youso Tamanokakehashi (1775) and Chingan Sodategusa (1787). Genetic analysis of 117 albino rat strains collected from all parts of the world carried out by a team led by Takashi Kuramoto at Kyoto University in 2012 showed that the albino rats descended from hooded rats and all the albino rats descended from a single ancestor. As there is evidence that the hooded rat was known as the \\"Japanese rat\\" in the early 20th century, Kuramoto concluded that one or more Japanese hooded rats might have been brought to Europe or the Americas and an albino rat that emerged as a product of the breeding of these hooded rats was the common ancestor of all the albino laboratory rats in use today. Use in research A lab rat dissection The rat found early use in laboratory research in five areas: W. S. Small suggested that the rate of learning could be measured by rats in a maze; a suggestion employed by John B. Watson for his Ph.D. dissertation in 1903.John B. Watson (1903) \\"Psychical development of the white rat\\", Ph.D. University of Chicago The first rat colony in America used for nutrition research was started in January 1908 by Elmer McCollum and then, nutritive requirements of rats were used by Thomas Burr Osborne and Lafayette Mendel to determine the details of protein nutrition. The reproductive function of rats was studied at the Institute for Experimental Biology at the University of California, Berkeley by Herbert McLean Evans and Joseph A. Long. The genetics of rats was studied by William Ernest Castle at the Bussey Institute of Harvard University until it closed in 1994. Rats have long been used in cancer research; for instance at the Crocker Institute for Cancer Research. A rat undergoing a Morris water navigation test The historical importance of this species to scientific research is reflected by the amount of literature on it: roughly 50% more than that on laboratory mice. Laboratory rats are frequently subject to dissection or microdialysis to study internal effects on organs and the brain, such as for cancer or pharmacological research. Laboratory rats not sacrificed may be euthanized or, in some cases, become pets. REM sleep using the flowerpot technique Domestic rats differ from wild rats in many ways: they are calmer and significantly less likely to bite, they can tolerate greater crowding, they breed earlier and produce more offspring, and their brains, livers, kidneys, adrenal glands, and hearts are smaller. Scientists have bred many strains or \\"lines\\" of rats specifically for experimentation. Most are derived from the albino Wistar rat, which is still widely used. Other common strains are the Sprague Dawley, Fischer 344, Holtzman albino strains, Long–Evans, and Lister black hooded rats. Inbred strains are also available, but are not as commonly used as inbred mice. Much of the genome of Rattus norvegicus has been sequenced. In October 2003, researchers succeeded in cloning two laboratory rats by nuclear transfer. This was the first in a series of developments that have begun to make rats tractable as genetic research subjects, although they still lag behind mice, which lend themselves better to the embryonic stem cell techniques typically used for genetic manipulation. Many investigators who wish to trace observations on behavior and physiology to underlying genes regard aspects of these in rats as more relevant to humans and easier to observe than in mice, giving impetus to the development of genetic research techniques applicable to rat. A rat traversing complex terrain under the influence of electrode inputs to its brain A 1972 study compared neoplasms in Sprague Dawley rats from six different commercial suppliers and found highly significant differences in the incidences of endocrine and mammary tumors. There were even significant variations in the incidences of adrenal medulla tumors among rats from the same source raised in different laboratories. All but one of the testicular tumors occurred in the rats from a single supplier. The researchers found that the incidence of tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats from different commercial sources varied as much from each other as from the other strains of rats. The authors of the study \\"stressed the need for extreme caution in evaluation of carcinogenicity studies conducted at different laboratories and/or on rats from different sources.\\"Comparison of Neoplasms in Six Sources of Rats During food rationing due to World War II, British biologists ate laboratory rat, creamed. Stocks and strains A strain, in reference to rodents, is a group in which all members are, as nearly as possible, genetically identical. In rats, this is accomplished through inbreeding. By having this kind of population, it is possible to conduct experiments on the roles of genes, or conduct experiments that exclude variations in genetics as a factor. By contrast, populations are used when identical genotypes are unnecessary or a population with genetic variation is required, and these rats are usually referred to as stocks rather than strains. =Wistar rat= A Wistar rat The Wistar rat is an outbred albino rat. This breed was developed at the Wistar Institute in 1906 for use in biological and medical research, and is notably the first rat developed to serve as a model organism at a time when laboratories primarily used the house mouse (Mus musculus). More than half of all laboratory rat strains are descended from the original colony established by physiologist Henry Donaldson, scientific administrator Milton J. Greenman, and genetic researcher/embryologist Helen Dean King.Clause, B. T. (1998). \\"The Wistar Institute Archives: Rats (Not Mice) and History\\", Mendel Newsletter February, 1998. The Wistar rat is currently one of the most popular rats used for laboratory research. It is characterized by its wide head, long ears, and a tail length that is always less than its body length. The Sprague Dawley rat and Long–Evans rat were developed from Wistar rats. Wistar rats are more active than others like Sprague Dawley rats. The spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Lewis rat are other well-known stocks developed from Wistar rats. = Long–Evans rat = The Long–Evans rat is an outbred rat developed by Drs. Long and Evans in 1915 by crossing several Wistar females with a wild gray male. Long-Evans rats are white with a black hood, or occasionally white with a brown hood. They are utilized as a multipurpose model organism, frequently in behavioral and obesity research. =Sprague Dawley rat= A Sprague Dawley rat The Sprague Dawley rat is an outbred multipurpose breed of albino rat used extensively in medical and nutritional research. Its main advantage is its calmness and ease of handling. This breed of rat was first produced by the Sprague-Dawley farms (later to become the Sprague-Dawley Animal Company) in Madison, Wisconsin in 1925. The name was originally hyphenated, although the brand styling today (Sprague Dawley, the trademark used by Envigo) is not. The average litter size of the Sprague Dawley rat is 11.0. These rats typically have a longer tail in proportion to their body length than Wistar rats. They were involved in the Séralini affair, where the herbicide RoundUp was claimed to increase the occurrence of tumor in these rats. However, since these rats are known to grow tumors at a high (and very variable) rate, the study was considered flawed in design and its findings unsubstantiated. =Biobreeding rat= The biobreeding rat (a.k.a. the biobreeding diabetes-prone rat or BBDP rat) is an inbred strain that spontaneously develops autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Like NOD mice, biobreeding rats are used as an animal model for Type 1 diabetes. The strain re-capitulates many of the features of human type 1 diabetes and has contributed greatly to the research of T1DM pathogenesis. =Brattleboro rat= The Brattleboro rat is a strain that was developed by Henry A. Schroeder and technician Tim Vinton in West Brattleboro, Vermont, beginning in 1961, for Dartmouth Medical School. It has a naturally occurring genetic mutation that makes specimens unable to produce the hormone vasopressin, which helps control kidney function. The rats were being raised for laboratory use by Dr. Henry Schroeder and technician Tim Vinton, who noticed that the litter of 17 drank and urinated excessively. =Hairless rat= Hairless laboratory rats provide researchers with valuable data regarding compromised immune systems and genetic kidney diseases. It is estimated that there are over 25 genes that cause recessive hairlessness in laboratory rats. The more common ones are denoted as rnu (Rowett nude), fz (fuzzy), and shn (shorn). A Rowett nude rat * Rowett nude rats, first identified in 1953 in Scotland, have no thymus. The lack of this organ severely compromises their immune system, with infections of the respiratory tract and eyes increasing the most dramatically. * Fuzzy rats were identified in 1976 in a Pennsylvania lab. The leading cause of death among fz/fz rats is ultimately a progressive kidney failure that begins around the age of 1 year. * Shorn rats were bred from Sprague Dawley rats in Connecticut in 1998. They also suffer from severe kidney problems. =Lewis rat= The Lewis rat was developed by Margaret Lewis from Wistar stock in the early 1950s. Characteristics include albino coloring, docile behavior, and low fertility. The Lewis rat suffers from several spontaneous pathologies: first, they can suffer from high incidences of neoplasms, with the rat's lifespan mainly determined by this. The most common are adenomas of the pituitary and adenomas/adenocarcinomas of the adrenal cortex in both sexes, mammary gland tumors and endometrial carcinomas in females, and C-cell adenomas/adenocarcinomas of the thyroid gland and tumors of the haemopoietic system in males. Second, Lewis rats are prone to develop a spontaneous transplantable lymphatic leukaemia. Lastly, when in advanced age, they sometimes develop spontaneous glomerular sclerosis. Current research applications include transplantation research, induced arthritis and inflammation, experimental allergic encephalitis, and STZ-induced diabetes. =Royal College of Surgeons rat= A Royal College of Surgeons rat undergoing visual acuity testing The Royal College of Surgeons rat (or RCS rat) is the first known animal with inherited retinal degeneration. Although the genetic defect was not known for many years, it was identified in the year 2000 as a mutation in the gene MERTK. This mutation results in defective retinal pigment epithelium phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. =Shaking rat Kawasaki= The shaking rat Kawasaki (SRK) is an autosomal recessive mutant rat that has a short deletion in the RELN (Reelin) gene. This results in the lowered expression of Reelin protein, essential for proper cortex lamination and cerebellum development. Its phenotype is similar to the widely researched reeler mouse. Shaking rat Kawasaki was first described in 1988. This and the Lewis rat are well-known stocks developed from Wistar rats. =Zucker rat= A Zucker rat, bred for obesity The Zucker rat was bred to be a genetic model for research on obesity and hypertension. They are named after Lois M. Zucker and Theodore F. Zucker, pioneer researchers in the study of the genetics of obesity. There are two types of Zucker rat: a lean Zucker rat, denoted as the dominant trait (Fa/Fa) or (Fa/fa); and the characteristically obese (or fatty) Zucker rat, which is actually a recessive trait (fa/fa) of the leptin receptor, capable of weighing up to —more than twice the average weight. Obese Zucker rats have high levels of lipids and cholesterol in their bloodstream, are resistant to insulin without being hyperglycemic, and gain weight from an increase in both the size and number of fat cells. Obesity in Zucker rats is primarily linked to their hyperphagic nature and excessive hunger; however, food intake does not fully explain the hyperlipidemia or overall body composition. =Knockout rats= A knockout rat (also spelled knock out or knock-out) is a genetically engineered rat with a single gene turned off through a targeted mutation. Knockout rats can mimic human diseases, and are important tools for studying gene function and for drug discovery and development. The production of knockout rats became technically feasible in 2008, through work financed by $120 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) via the Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium, and work accomplished by the members of the Knock Out Rat Consortium (KORC). Knockout rat disease models for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, and diabetes, using zinc-finger nuclease technology, are being commercialized by SAGE Labs.

None of them have had the operational details formally disclosed, and as a result, little information is known on these. Operations = Operation Clydesdale= Operation Clydesdale has had no publicity within the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), and must therefore be considered as classified as the better known Operation Kratos. This deals with a prospective raid against a suicide bomber, and also authorises officers to shoot-to-kill if they think it is necessary to reduce the threat to themselves and the general public. =Operation Rainbow= Operation Rainbow was started on 23 May 1995, as a response to the 1993 Bishopsgate bomb that wreaked havoc throughout the city of London. Operation Rainbow is the only currently running overt Anti Terrorist policy of the MPS, and is the longest running police operation ever. The operation co-ordinates responses to, and provides information about the threat of Terrorism to the city. It has been described as a ‘London success’ that has contributed enormously to the protection of Londoners from terrorist attacks. The main focus that Operation Rainbow is based upon is the viewing of CCTV. The unit constantly maintains a database of recording CCTV areas throughout London, which is available to all officers for use not only in the prevention of terrorism but other investigations, such as anti social behaviour and robberies. Operation Rainbow is by far the most mentioned policy but the details are still sketchy as contradicting sources confuse the matter. According to some, \\"This is a team of officers who are constantly updating our contingency plans in relation to vulnerable sites in the Borough\\". The Rainbow title is also that of a unit, and indeed is known, in another quote, \\"Staff in the operation Rainbow unit conducted briefings, talks and seminars delivering their message to 1,655 officers and support staff\\". So, it can be correctly assumed that the Rainbow name applies to the unit and the operation controlled by the unit. \\"Operation Rainbow continues to organise and develop the overt aspects of the MPS counter terrorism strategy. This includes routine patrolling, informed awareness…\\" =Operation Lightning= Operation Lightning is a national intelligence gathering operation run by SO15 (Counter terrorism Command) designed to record and analyse suspicious sightings or activity at or near to any prominent buildings or structures. This would include the public transport system throughout the United Kingdom, and would include the cooperation of the British Transport Police, as in relation to the transport network. It would also probably include the cooperation of SO18 (aviation and airport policing) and SCD10 – Surveillance (covert policing). =Operation Trammel= Operation Trammel is an operation run by SO13 designed to identify criminals linked with terrorist organisations by the use of 'key indicators'. This would include credit card related fraud and forged documents used to fund terrorism. This policy would not have such a high-profile role, as the results would not be as evident to the press, it would merely be treated as another 'terrorism related arrest' =Operation Camion= Operation Camion is designed to identify and deal with individuals who support international terrorist groups linked to the Al-Qaeda network, who are engaged in the theft of vehicles containing hazardous material (material with nuclear, biological or chemical dangers or high explosive capabilities) and theft of marked emergency services vehicles or identifiable military vehicles that would not normally attract suspicion. There have been expressions of incredulity by the public that fully operating emergency vehicles (specifically NHS West Midlands Ambulances and Surrey Police cars) have been found for sale on Internet auction sites such as eBay.

On his father's side, he was the great-grandson of Nathan of Breslov (known as Reb Noson), the closest disciple of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, who promulgated the movement after Nachman's death. On his mother's side, he was the grandson of Rabbi Nachman Goldstein, known as the Tcheriner Rav, who was one of Reb Noson's leading disciples. Because of these family relationships, Sternhartz was privy to all the traditions and stories about Reb Noson. These formed the basis for his volume of oral traditions related to Likutey Moharan, entitled Tovot Zichronot, published by his disciple Rabbi Gedaliah Aharon Koenig. Rabbi Sternhartz also authored a complete commentary on Likutey Moharan that was lost in Jerusalem during Israel's 1948 War of Independence. Child prodigy Sternhartz was orphaned of his parents as a young boy and was raised by his grandfather. Like the Tcheriner Rav, the young Abraham was a child prodigy who applied himself to his Torah studies with great diligence. He completed the study of all 2,711 pages of the Talmud by the age of 16, a feat normally reserved for older scholars. He also dedicated himself to the study of Rebbe Nachman's teachings. Every day after morning prayers, he would seclude himself in the attic to study Rebbe Nachman's magnum opus, Likutey Moharan, and not come downstairs until he had memorized that day's lesson. Later in life, people would say that his every action was based on some statement in Rebbe Nachman's teachings. After his marriage, Sternhartz began working as a sofer (scribe) in the town of Tcherin, Ukraine. At the age of 19 he was appointed rabbi of Kremenchug in eastern Ukraine. At the age of 22 he was named prayer leader for the annual Rosh Hashana kibbutz (prayer gathering) in Uman, an honor accorded by the Breslover Hasidim to scholars of great piety. Aliyah to the Holy Land Sternhartz emigrated to Palestine in 1936 and was recognized as the outstanding Breslover elder of his generation who possessed all the wealth of Breslov traditions. He settled in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, and established a Rosh Hashanah kibbutz in the northern part of the Land of Israel at the burial site of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in 1940, since the grave of Rebbe Nachman in Uman was off-limits to foreigners. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Sternhartz and many other Breslover Hasidim were evicted from the Old City by the invading Jordanian army, and were resettled in the neighborhood of Katamon. During this war many of Sternhartz's precious manuscripts were lost, including his complete commentary on Likutey Moharan, along with unpublished manuscripts of the Tcheriner Rav. Breslover elder Until his death at the age of 93, Sternhartz continued to teach and inspire his students, many of whom became Breslover leaders in coming decades. These students included: Rabbis Gedaliah Aharon Koenig, Moshe Burstein, Nachman Burstein, Michel Dorfman (who married Sternhartz's granddaughter), Shmuel Horowitz, Moshe Kremer, Tzvi Aryeh Lippel, Zvi Aryeh Rosenfeld, Shmuel Shapira, and Yaakov Meir Shechter.

The Wolverhampton ward population taken at the 2011 census was 12,497. Situated off Hickman Avenue, near Monmore Green stadium, the park has good transport links to the city centre. Its name is also used for the East Park ward, which covers the Monmore Green and Deansfield areas. Work began on the original design \\"Utile Dolci\\" by Thomas Mawson on 18 hectares of land donated by the Duke of Sutherland, Sir Alfred Hickman, and Mr Arther Sparrow in 1892, with the park opening for business on 21 September 1896. The original design included a boating lake; however this was beset with problems as old coal mines that were previously there began to drain the water from the lake. Despite great efforts to save the lake, it was grassed over in 1922 and is now part of a children's playground and all weather sports pitch. This has since been turned into a car park in 2013. The park includes The Lysaght Memorial Clock Tower, however this has been out of order for over 30 years although rumors continue to circulate that funding will become available to refurbish this in the near future (Work started in 2013), and a small band stand originally funded by the proceeds of a floral fete. Although presently (2012) repairable according to The Scottish Ironwork Database (https://web.archive.org/web/20120512104228/http://www.scottishironwork.org/catdetail.asp?ironid=25956) the bandstand is currently considered to be \\"at risk\\" having suffered years of neglect and vandalism. Current facilities include football pitches, tennis courts, children's playgrounds, cycle speedway, fitness and exercise equipment alongside gardens, walkways and flower beds. Once a year, the Wolvestock4life festival takes place. It has been hosted by East park for over ten years and annually brings in over 4,000 people. The festival, now in its 14th year, is the largest free-to-enter festival in the United Kingdom. It has no longer free since 2013. A Lottery grant of £981,000 was granted in December 2011 to stabilize the aforementioned coal mines and refurbish the park's facilities, including the clock tower.

His real surname was Ball, and he was born at Burwell, Cambridgeshire. Fitzball was educated in Newmarket, was apprenticed to a Norwich printer in 1809. He produced some dramatic pieces at the local theatre, and eventually the marked success of his Innkeeper of Abbeville, or The Ostler and the Robber (1820), together with the friendly acceptance of one of his pieces at the Surrey Theatre by Thomas John Dibdin, induced him to settle in London. During the next twenty-five years, he produced a great number of plays, most of which were successful. He had a special talent for nautical drama. His Floating Beacon (Surrey Theatre, 19 April 1824) ran for 140 nights, and his Pilot (Adelphi, 1825) for 200 nights. He also produced a seminal play on The Flying Dutchman and wrote the libretto for Edward Loder's Raymond and Agnes. His greatest triumph in melodrama was perhaps Jonathan Bradford, or Murder at the Roadside Inn (Surrey Theatre, 12 June 1833). He was at one time stock dramatist and reader of plays at Covent Garden, and afterwards at Drury Lane. He had a considerable reputation as a songwriter and as a librettist in opera. He wrote the librettos for William Vincent Wallace's operas Maritana and Lurline. The last years of his life were spent in retirement at Chatham, where he died at the age of 81.

Thomas Jones. The Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral is the senior cleric of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, elected by the chapter of the cathedral. The office was created in 1219 or 1220, by one of several charters granted to the cathedral by Archbishop Henry de Loundres between 1218 and 1220. For centuries, the Dean of St. Patrick's was the only dean in Dublin and documents of those years often refer to him as the \\"Dean of Dublin\\" – but from around 1539 there was also the office of \\"Dean of Christ Church Cathedral\\", which had been a priory, headed by a prior and canons. Election The right to elect the Dean of St. Patrick's is vested exclusively in the chapter of the cathedral (though before 1870 there could be an exception where a vacancy occurred due to promotion of the dean to the office of a bishop) and has been defended against monarchs and even the Pope. Jonathan Swift, perhaps the most famous dean, was appointed against the strong opposition of Queen Anne, who disliked him. The Archbishop of Dublin has one of the 28 seats (the dean plus 3 other dignities and 24 canons), used only at the time of election, but no other special authority. Holders of the office of dean The following have served as deans (where they are known to have previously held office at the cathedral, this is noted): =Pre-Reformation= * 1219-c.1238 – William FitzGuido, first dean, appointed by Archbishop Henry de Loundres * c.1238-c.1250 – Richard Gardiner * c.1250–1275 – Richard de St. Martin, a sitting prebendary * 1275–1284 – John de Sandford, Franciscan, Prebendary of Howth; later Archbishop of Dublin (his brother Fulk Basset had earlier held that office) * 1284–1311 – Thomas de Chaddesworth or Chadsworth, Chancellor * 1311-c.1338 - William de Rodyard, Treasurer; later, first Chancellor of the first University of Dublin and Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas * 1348–1353 – Adam de Kingston * 1353–1374 – William de Bromley, Prebendary of Lusk; also Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, Treasurer of Ireland and Keeper of the Great Seal * 1374–1382 – John Colton (also Lord Chancellor of Ireland, 1379–1382 and afterwards Archbishop of Armagh in 1382) * 1382–1391 – Henry Bowett, papal chaplain; became Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1401 and was Archbishop of York from 1407-1423 * 1396–1401 – Thomas de Everdon, a sitting prebendary; Master of the Rolls in Ireland.

The allowability of disclaimers is subject to particular conditions, which may vary widely from one jurisdiction to another. Origins Possibly the earliest mention of patent disclaimers was in the British \\"Letters Patent and Trademark Amendment Act 1835\\", in the sense of a right to renounce one's patent monopoly or a part thereof. That right was subject to safeguards to make sure that the disclaimer was a true renunciation, rather than an extension of the monopoly. In 1865, in a case before the House of Lords, Ralston v. Smith (XI H.L.C. 223), the applicability of these safeguards were illustrated. Namely, an amendment by the patentee extended beyond the content of the patent application as filed, therefore extended the patent monopoly, and was not allowed by the House of Lords. Statutory disclaimer In United States patent law, a statutory disclaimer is a statement in writing, recorded in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, disclaiming a complete claim of a patent or disclaiming a term, or terminal part of a term, of a patent granted or to be granted. If a claim in a patent is invalid, requires that the invalid claim be disclaimed before costs may be recovered. A disclaimer disclaiming a terminal part of a term is called a terminal disclaimer and is often used to overcome a rejection for obviousness-type double patenting; however, a terminal disclaimer is ineffective against a rejection for same-invention double patenting under .MPEP § 804.02 Avoiding a Double Patenting Rejection A statutory disclaimer may be filed as a paper document or through the Electronic Filing System as a document saved as PDF.

Harris was a 1989 All-American and finished fifth and third in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1988 and 1989, respectively. He was also the ECAC Player of the Year in 1988 and 1989. Harris was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009. He is now an assistant wide receivers coach for North Hills High School in Pittsburgh. Early life Harris played football at Brashear High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (he would later be called the Brashear Bullet by West Virginia announcer Jack Fleming). As a senior, Harris threw a game-winning, 79-yard touchdown pass on the last play of the game against Indiana High School. Harris was named Pittsburgh's high school football player of the year after his junior and senior seasons by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and was a Sporting News Top 100 prospect following his final season. College career =Freshman (1987)= Major was interested in attending the University of Pittsburgh, but the coach, Mike Gottfried, was only interested with him at defensive back. Harris took another offer at West Virginia, where coach Don Nehlen was trying to rebuild the quarterback position. Nehlen set up a football camp for two-hand touch football and stated, \\"The kids couldn't touch him.\\" Nehlen signed Florida prep quarterback Browning Nagle along with Harris and redshirted them for the season. Harris and Nagle battled it out in spring practice and Harris eventually won the job, so Nagle transferred to University of Louisville. Harris struggled at first, but when the fifth game came around at East Carolina University, Harris stood out and ended West Virginia's season with a bid to the Sun Bowl against Oklahoma State University. West Virginia lost, but Harris rushed for over 100 yards.WVU :: Athletics That season, Harris threw for 1,200 yards and 10 touchdowns on only 77 completions. Harris also rushed for 615 yards and 6 touchdowns. =Sophomore (1988)= The following season, he directed West Virginia to the school's first-ever undefeated, untied regular season and a matchup against No. 1 ranked Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship. In getting the Mountaineers to the Fiesta Bowl, Harris baffled opponents all season with his daring, unpredictable, wide-open style. Against Boston College, Harris recorded a career-high 297 passing yards. Harris' dazzling play was never more evident than in West Virginia's 51–30 dismantling of long-time nemesis Penn State. Harris outgained the entire Penn State team, 301 to 292, and produced the school's most exciting run ever in the first quarter of that game.WVU Varsity Club That run and several more like it helped him finish fifth in the Heisman Trophy race that year and earn ECAC player of the year honors.WVU Varsity Club His season passing totals were 1,915 yards and 14 touchdowns, while he rushed for 610 yards and 6 touchdowns. He had the highest passing- efficiency rating of any college quarterback during the season, and totaled 2,348 total yards of offense and averaging 8.4 yards per touch. As the Mountaineers traveled to their first ever National Championship game, the Irish were favored. But on the third play of the game, Major Harris was hit and separated his shoulder. Harris stayed in the game, but didn't throw the ball often, scrambling instead. West Virginia never threatened Notre Dame's lead, and the Fighting Irish won, 34–21. \\"The Play\\" Against Penn State in 1988, as the play clock wound down, Harris forgot the play he had called in the huddle. As soon as the ball was snapped, the entire West Virginia team went in one direction and Harris went the other. He faked out the entire Penn State team leaving no fewer than seven tacklers grabbing air on the way to a thrilling touchdown—and one of the more memorable plays in WVU history. The Mountaineers won the game, 51–30. Harris' coach, Don Nehlen, said of the run, \\"I had called 37 and he ran 36. Everybody else on our offense went one way, and Major went the other. He literally ran through the Penn State defense for a touchdown of about 30 yards. After he scored, Major came to the sideline and apologized. He said, \\"My fault, Coach.\\" People still ask me about that play all of the time...If there was a contest for most exciting player, Major would win it hands down.\\" =Junior (1989)= As a junior in 1989, Harris was equally spectacular despite not having as strong a supporting cast. Harris still led WVU to a 8-2-1 season. Against Rutgers during the season, Harris had a career-high 163 rushing yards. He finished third in the 1989 Heisman Trophy balloting on the season, earned first team Kodak All-America honors and was a second team AP and Football News All American. Like 1988, Harris was again voted ECAC player of the year. That year, Harris led the Mountaineers to a Gator Bowl game, but they lost to Clemson, 27–7. Harris threw for 2,058 yards and 17 touchdowns on the season, along with 936 and 6 touchdowns rushing. Harris set school records that season for most total offense and quarterback rushing yards. Both records, however, have since been broken. =Legacy= Harris established a WVU record with 7,334 total yards (ranks #5 as of 2015), and became the first of just a handful of quarterbacks in Division I history to pass for more than 5,000 yards and rush for more than 2,000 yards in a career. His 2,161 rushing yards rank 10th (as of 2015) on the school's all-time rushing list. Harris' longest pass of his career was 70 yards and his longest run was 75 yards. Harris was selected for the 2009 College Football Hall of Fame induction class. Professional career =NFL and CFL= After the completion of his junior year, Harris decided to leave school early and was drafted in the 12th round by the Los Angeles Raiders in the 1990 NFL Draft. However, Harris instead chose to sign with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in May 1990. He spent the 1990 season backing up quarterbacks Doug Flutie and Joe Paopao. In limited duty, Harris completed 18 of 42 passes for 300 yards, with three touchdowns and three interceptions. He also rushed for 145 yards and three scores. =Arena Football League= Harris then spent three years in the Arena Football League (1991–1992, 1994) where his 429 rushing yards in his first season of 1991 stood as the single-season league record until Michael Bishop ran for 459 yards in 2005. In 1991, Harris also passed for 940 yards, with nine touchdowns and nine interceptions. The next season, he passed for 837 yards, 12 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Harris finished his third season in Arena Football with 382 yards passing and eight touchdowns in 1994.

Johnson, and the son of Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr. He was a struggling farmer and cattle speculator who lived in the Texas Hill Country. Early life Samuel Johnson was born in Buda, Texas, the fifth child of Eliza Bunton and Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr., and showed intelligence at an early age. When he was ten years old, his family moved from Buda to the Pedernales. On his family's Pedernales farm, he developed a strong sense of competition. In his teens he developed a desire to be \\"more than a farmer\\" and began attending a local school. However, at that time even so- called public schools required tuition, and his family struggled to afford the payments. When the barber of Johnson City retired, Sam bought his chair and tools with a loan and began practicing on his friends to gain skill at cutting hair. Once he learned, he was able to pay his school's tuition fees by selling haircuts in the evenings. He had to quit going to high school because of health problems, and his parents sent him to live on his uncle Lucius Bunton's ranch in Presidio County, Texas for several months. When he returned home, Johnson had ambitions to become a teacher; however, the Texas hill country at that time had no state-accredited high schools and no colleges. He learned that he could get a state-issued teaching certificate without finishing high school by passing a state examination. In 1896, with the thirteen textbooks he needed to study for the exam, he moved to his retired grandfather's nearby home to study in quiet. Johnson passed the exam and, for the next three years, taught in one-room school houses throughout the hill country. He wanted to move on and become a lawyer, but financially he had to return home and work alongside his father on their family farm. Once his father became too old to work, Johnson began renting the farm from him and working it by himself. After a few years of plentiful rain and no flash floods, he had gained enough income to hire a number of farm hands and begin trading in cotton futures contracts in Fredericksburg, Texas. Considered a very friendly person, he became a popular figure in the area surrounding Johnson City. Personal life A Johnson Family gathering in 1912.

Lyndon B. Johnson (ca. 4 years old) is standing in front of the automobile. He married Rebekah Baines (1881–1958), daughter of Joseph Wilson Baines and his wife, on August 20, 1907. Their first child, Lyndon B. Johnson, was born on August 27, 1908. They had four more children: Rebekah (1910–1978), Josefa (1912–1961), Sam Houston Johnson (1914–1978), and Lucia (1916–1997). According to Lady Bird Johnson, Johnson's wife, he planned to join the Christadelphian Church, where his father and mother and sister were members, toward the end of his life. Political career Sam Johnson served five terms in the Texas House of Representatives as a Populist Democrat. During his time in the state legislature, he fought against conservative Democrats who served business interests. While at the time, the lobbyists employed widespread bribery with the elected Texas officials. Representative Sam Johnson refused bribes and favors from lobbyists. His son, Lyndon Johnson used his father's record as a Populist to aid his own political career. In 1896 and 1898, Republican Robert B. Hawley was elected by a plurality as Congressman, when the white vote was split between the Democrats and Populist Party. To reduce competition by Republicans and Populists, the state legislature in 1901 passed a poll tax, which had the desired effect of disfranchising most blacks, and many Latino and poor white voters.\\"Nixon v. Condon. Disfranchisement of the Negro in Texas\\", The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 41, No. 8, June 1932, p. 1212, accessed March 21, 2008 Texas effectively became a one-party state, like the other states of the former Confederacy in this period, and blacks were blocked from the political process until civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s.Michael Perman.Struggle for Mastery: Disenfranchisement in the South, 1888–1908. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001, Introduction From 1867 to 1874 the Reconstruction era Republicans in the Texas State Legislature had raised taxes to provide for the first universal free education, and to start establishing welfare institutions such as hospitals, to serve the people. To restrict the power of the legislature, the Democratic- dominated legislature amended the Constitution of the State of Texas in a measure passed by remaining white voters. The amendment scheduled the legislature to meet only every other year as well as setting legislators' pay at five dollars a day—which would be reduced to two dollars a day if the legislature ran longer than 60 days. =First term (1905–1907)= Sam Ealy Johnson Jr. as a Member of the Texas House of Representatives in 1905 Samuel Johnson's political career began in 1904, when his brother-in-law, Judge Clarence W. Martin, a former State Representative, encouraged him to run for the Democratic nomination to the state house from the 89th District. Given the Democrats' dominance by this time, the primary was the only competitive contest. Johnson won the Democratic nomination unanimously and in his acceptance speech, he cast his campaign as part of a larger populist movement, although the Populist Party had largely died out. He won the election against his Republican opponent by winning large margins in Johnson City as well as the small towns along the Pedernales River. His opponent, a Texas-German speaking lawyer, won only Gillespie County, a largely German and Republican area. When he arrived at the Texas State Capitol in January 1905 at the age of 27, Johnson adapted well to the life of a legislator. Although relatively unsophisticated, he became an expert at parliamentary procedure. and persuading other legislators to his view. During his term he worked with two other legislators, \\"Honest Buck\\" Gray and Claud Hudspeth, to support Populist causes such as an eight-hour workday for railroad workers and a Franchise tax for corporations. Although largely successful in terms of passing legislation, he and other populists were often on the losing side in trying to gain legislation to regulate Texas' large corporations. One of Johnson's early political achievements was preserving the Alamo as a part of Texas' heritage. Although many Texans worked on this project, previous attempts had failed because of lingering questions over jurisdiction and because legislators balked at the asking price of $65,000 to purchase the fort. When Representative Johnson drafted the bill, he ensured the Alamo mission would be overseen by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. On January 26, 1905, his bill passed into law. In 1905 Johnson also gained passage of legislation banning calf roping and a bill exempting Blanco County from state law requiring the payment of wolf bounties, which could have bankrupted the county. =Second term (1907–1909)= In the 1906 election, Johnson faced David Martin, the owner of the Martin Telephone Company and a resident of Llano County, Texas, in the Democratic primary. He had the support of newspapers in the four counties that comprised the 89th District. He won such large margins in the primary that the county Republicans did not put up a candidate for the general election. In the 1907 session of the Texas State Legislature, the re-election of Senator Joseph Weldon Bailey was the most controversial issue. In 1907, Senators were still elected by their state legislatures. The Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which allowed for the direct election of Senators, had not yet been passed. Although Joseph Weldon Bailey had been one of the most prominent populists in the country at one time, in 1906 his opponents had accused him of taking large legal fees from railroads, lumber companies, and Standard Oil. Samuel Johnson was one of a few members of the legislature who tried to postpone Bailey's election until the Texas House of Representatives had conducted an investigation. When Bailey, backed by a number of railroads and oil companies, arrived at the Texas State Capitol, his forces bribed nearly all 133 members of the House of Representatives to vote in his favor. Despite being thousands of dollars in debt, Samuel Johnson refused any attempt to sway his vote. He did not vote for Bailey, and he was one of seven members to vote present.Texas House Journal 1907, pp. 195–196, http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/HouseJournals/30/houseJournal30thLeg_101.pdf His stand against business interests made him a hero to political observers in Austin as well as his constituents in the 89th District. Party officials in all four counties encouraged him to run for a third term, but because of his financial problems, Johnson left the legislature, returning to his farm in the Hill Country. Although most returning representatives were offered patronage jobs in the state government or with a railroad, oil company, or bank, because Samuel Johnson had refused to take bribes throughout his career, he was not offered one. =Third Term (1918–1923)= In November 1917, a special election was called to fill a vacancy in the 89th District, the seat Samuel Johnson had vacated ten years earlier. In the interim, between 1907 and 1917, Johnson had re-established his financial standing and owned a number of local businesses. His reputation remained intact, largely because of his reputation of helping others. In April 1917, farmers from Blanco County elected him to the local draft board. When Johnson decided to run in the special election, no one ran against him, and he served out the rest of the term. Business career Portrait of Samuel Johnson's son, Lyndon B. Johnson Samuel Johnson had made gains in the cotton futures market in 1902, 1903, and 1904; however in 1905, he lost all of the money he had invested. His son, Lyndon B. Johnson later noted, \\"My daddy went busted waiting for cotton to go up to twenty-one cents a pound, and the market fell apart when it hit twenty\\". In 1906, he took out a loan and bought futures contracts on margin, but lost money again. When he arrived in the Texas State Capitol after his election in 1906, he was \\"several thousand dollars in debt\\". After retiring from the legislature in 1908, Johnson began to buy and sell real estate in addition to farming. He did well in selling real estate, so well that he hired a local teenager as a chauffeur and paid a staff of cleaning ladies to handle household tasks for his wife. He re-invested the profits from real estate into buying local businesses. He bought several ranches, a small movie theater, as well as the only hotel in Johnson City. In 1916, he bought the local newspaper, the Johnson City Record, an \\"eight page weekly\\" from its owner. Four months later, he sold the paper to Reverdy Giddon, as many of his subscribers could not pay in cash. Having regained his financial footing, he ran for a third term in 1917. In 1920, he sold all of his real estate, and went $40,000 into debt to restart cotton farming. He was motivated by post-WWI cotton prices, which were $0.40, but expected to rise to $0.50 or $0.60. Heavy spring storms repeatedly washed away the crops, and cotton prices fell to $0.08. The Johnson family lost everything.

He has since become an important role model for the aid-working vocation, particularly among Christians. Sean Devereux died at the age of 28. Sean Devereux was the only son of Dermot Devereux, a British Airways cabin steward from Wexford, Ireland, and his wife Maureen, a nurse from Cork. He grew up in Yateley, Hampshire. He was educated at Salesian College, Farnborough and the University of Birmingham, obtaining his honours degree in Sports, Science, and Geography, and then training as a teacher at the University of Exeter. He became a popular master of Physical Education at the Salesian College in Farnborough, Hampshire, teaching for two academic years before departing to take up missionary work in Africa. He arrived in Liberia in February 1989 and began work with the Salesian community at St. Francis School in Tappita District, briefly finding himself imprisoned after pleading for the release of a student drafted into the army as a child-soldier. In his second year, escalating violence during the Liberian Civil War had forced the closing of the school and Devereux joined the UN refugee agency, where on one occasion he was beaten by soldiers after confronting one of them for attempting to steal food meant for refugees. Ultimately he was ordered out of the country in September 1992 and Devereux duly left for a brief stint in Sierra Leone. He then began working with UNICEF in Somalia, where he was assigned to organise relief for the starving, particularly children, in Kismayo, the stronghold of one of many warlords. After only four months in the country, Devereux was fatally shot in the back of the head by a lone hired gunman while walking near the UNICEF compound on Saturday, 2 January 1993. His assassination came on the eve of the visit to Mogadishu by UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 'Sean Devereux Park' in Yateley is named in his honour and a plaque commemorates him. A BBC Everyman Documentary was produced about Sean Devereux. It is called 'Mr Sean' and was created in May 1993.

On January 30, 2003, Metra announced plans to build a new service line that would introduce a new fleet of Diesel multiple unit trains (DMUs) to connect nearly 100 communities in the region and form Metra's only suburb-to-suburb service. Currently all of Metra's services are oriented on suburb-to-city travel. The route of the STAR line was planned to travel along the EJ&E; right of way and in the median of the Northwest Tollway (Interstate 90). The tollway median was a proposed extension of the CTA Blue Line westward to Schaumburg, but construction plans of the Suburban Transit Access Route caused the former to be scrapped. Very high ridership was expected due to its unique travel theme: around 80,000 passengers a day. The line was to be 55 miles in length. The preliminary cost estimate for the STAR Line was $1.1 billion. The project was authorized under what was, in 2005, the most recent federal transportation funding bill: SAFETEA-LU. The project underwent Alternatives Analysis before cancellation. Project The Metra route would have been the first suburb-to- suburb train line in the Chicago area. The line would have started at O'Hare International Airport, run west along Interstate 90 towards Hoffman Estates, then south along the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway towards Joliet. The line would have connected almost 100 communities in Will, DuPage, and Cook County. The route would have used a new fleet of European-style trains running at , providing service at 15-minute intervals during peak periods. In June 2003, the Regional Transportation Authority board unanimously signaled their support for the proposed STAR Line. The project would have cost $1.1 billion and would have taken 10 years to build, depending on funding. In January 2012, the Daily Herald reported that Metra was no longer actively studying the project, partly due to a lack of funding from federal and state governments. Other transport modes, such as bus rapid transit, offered a cheaper alternative to the STAR Line.

History Historically, the concept of tuning was to maintain a specific musical scale. When choruses sing in tune, the music reinforces itself with higher harmonics; aesthetically, the notes are more pleasing to the ear. But when signals are out of tune, dissonance occurs; the effect is most noticeable for musical groups of small children, who have not been trained to sing in tune. Radio Tuning became important for the development of radio broadcasts. Stations learned to broadcast at a specific frequency, and to share the bandwidth of the frequency spectrum. Thus radio receivers had to have circuitry to tune to a specific carrier frequency. This was accomplished by creating electronic filters which could accept specific frequency ranges, or tuned filters. Television and video The specific techniques for audio broadcasting transferred naturally to television. However, as video techniques became more widespread, the types of tuning went beyond the simple radio and audio frequency ranges, to specific spatial discrimination of spatial frequencies and textures.

The technique was first described in 1966 by Dr. Alan B. Pritsker of Purdue University and WW Happ.Modeling and Analysis Using Q-GERT Networks A. Alan B. Pritsker, 2nd Edition, Wiley, 1979 Compared to other techniques, GERT is only rarely used in complex systems. Nevertheless, the GERT approach addresses the majority of the limitations associated with PERT/CPM technique. GERT allows loops between tasks. The fundamental drawback associated with the GERT technique is the complex programme (Monte Carlo simulation) required to model the GERT system. Development in GERT includes Q-GERTS - allowing the user to consider queuing within the system.  General GERT rules  GERT uses activity-on-arrow notation only. That means that each activity is described on arrow. The nodes are used to connect activities, but also to determine type and conditions of relations between them. Each task has two parameters: duration and probability of appearance. There are three logical operators in GERT which concern activities incoming to the node: * XOR - alternative (only one path possible) * OR - alternative (one or more paths can be performed) * AND - all paths have to be performed The most common is AND, which means that every incoming activity has to happen before the outcoming one start. There are also two types of relations that concern activities outcoming from the node: * deterministic - every outcoming activity has probability equal to 1, which means that every one will be performed * probabilistic - each outcoming activity has some probability of appearance.  GERT vs. other network diagrams  Its much less popular than PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) or CPM (Critical Path Method). However it has can offer much more than those methods. PERT or CPM are very popular in most projects, but they have their limitations. The main are: * there are no alternative paths - all activities have to be performed * there are no loops - it is not possible to repeat activity, next similar activity has to be added * there are no decisions in the diagram - no and, or, xor options which help to choose proper path * there are no scaling - it is not possible to replace some detailed group of activities with the one summary task. GERT doesn't have those limitations. But it comes at a cost of more sophisticated diagram.

This ascent received much acclaim in the climbing community. Although Sharma did not rate the problem (jokingly, he stated that if he had to, it would have been V16Video documenting first ascent), it was thought by many to be hard V14 in the bouldering grading system. However, the problem was repeated by other climbers in quick succession: (#1: Dave Graham; #2: Jared Roth; #3: Fred Nicole; #4: Luke Parady; #5: Ian Vickers; #6: Dave Struthers, all within the first year after the first ascent), and the grade was consolidated at V11 or V12. Since the first ascent, several holds have broken including one of the crux holds. The problem is now thought to be soft V12. The Mandala saw its first female ascent in January 2008 by Lisa Rands.

Some sediment can be seen entering the lake at its western end. Map including Lake Puma Yumco Puma Yumco literally means The Blue Jewel which is floating in the sky. The lake freezes in winter and is crossed by shepherds with their sheep. Since the climate is warming, the ice is becoming thinner and thus creates a problem for the 120 people living off and around the lake. The lake is considered ultraoligotrophic, meaning that nutrient concentrations in both the water column and lake sediments are extremely low. Water in such lakes tends to be blue to blue-green and to have high clarity due to low levels of photosynthesizing organisms such as phytoplankton. During the winter, the lake develops intricate ice block patterns on the surface, ranging from less than ten to hundreds of metres in diameter. The ice pattern is caused by repeated cycles of freezing, fracturing, and refreezing of the ice due to variations in temperature and wind-induced ice motion. Climate The area around Lake Puma Yumco has a dry tundra climate (ET) with long, very cold, very dry winters and short, cool, somewhat humid summers. There is a great variety between day and night. Summer temperatures often rise to 15 °C (59 °F), but even then they often fall below freezing at night time. Likewise, while temperatures do reach temperatures above freezing even in January, at night time they commonly reach −20 °C (−4 °F). Thanks to the cold temperatures, the lake is frozen over most of the year.

The parish is situated on the Weald, north of Uckfield; the settlements of Five Ash Down, Heron's Ghyll and High Hurstwood are included within its boundaries. At one time its importance lay in the Wealden iron industry, and later it became commercially important in the poultry and egg industry. The village has both road (the high street is also the A272) and rail links to Uckfield and to London via Oxted. History The origin of the name Buxted comes from the Saxon Bochs stede (place of the beeches). The iron- making industry became a major part of Buxted's early prosperity. The first standard blast furnace was called Queenstock and was built in Buxted parish in about 1491. The cannon-making industry in the Weald started at a furnace on the stream at Hoggets Farm lying to the north between Buxted and Hadlow Down. The first cast iron cannon made in England was cast in 1543 by Ralf Hogge, an employee of Parson William Levett, a Sussex rector with broad interests, paradoxically enough, in the emerging English armaments industry. Levett was removed as Buxted's vicar in 1545 by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury. But thanks to friends in high places, Levett was quickly reinstated. After regaining his clerical position, Levett died a very wealthy man, thanks to his iron mining and smelting operations, founded by his brother John Levett, one of the founders of the Sussex iron industry and one of the wealthiest men in Sussex, who controlled 20 Sussex manors at his death in 1535. The family is of Norman descent and one of the oldest in Sussex. William and John Levett were the sons of a large landowner in the Hollington area of Hastings, Sussex. In his lengthy will, parson William Levett left large charitable bequests which he directed be supervised by his friend Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu. Richard Woodman, an ironmaster was born here, but he was burnt as a Protestant martyr in 1557. The manor house, known as Buxted Park, was purchased by the then Prime Minister, Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, in the early part of the 19th century. He set about extending the park surrounding the house, and eventually coerced the villagers to vacate their own houses to enable him to do so. The village (although not the church) was cleared away and the village then took up its present location.Old views and maps of Buxted By 1836, the entire original village centre was no more, having been relocated to the site it occupies today. Some of the outlying houses pre-date this move, such as Britts, a 17th-century farmhouse, which still stands. The original manor house was built further down the hill next to the railway where Queen Victoria once visited – the house being the Chequers of its day. The original house burnt down in the latter part of the 19th century and was rebuilt in its present location. Legends Nan Tuck's Lane According to local legend, the ghost of Nan Tuck, a woman from Rotherfield who allegedly poisoned a man in the 17th century, is said to haunt Nan Tuck's Lane in Buxted. Supposedly, the murder was quickly discovered and Tuck evaded her pursuers over the next few days by climbing hedges and hiding in hay ricks. It is said her intention was to take sanctuary in Buxted Parish Church – according to the right of asylum, if one could reach a church and touch the altar, a fugitive might escape punishment – but with local officials pursuing her, she was forced to run into the woods. According to the tale, she disappeared there and was never seen again. Legend holds that a circular patch of land in the woods near Nan Tuck's Lane stays unfertile and no vegetation will grow there. Census Buxted is part of electoral ward called Buxted and Maresfield. The population of this ward as taken in the census 2011 was 5,534. Geography The parish of Buxted lies partly within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, although the village itself is outside it. Tributaries of both the Rivers Rother (flowing eastward) and Cuckmere flow through the parish, and were used by the iron industry for power. It is largely a rural parish, although the original Britts farmland is now largely covered by modern houses along Britts Farm Road, constructed in the 1980s. The parish contains an area of Site of Special Scientific Interest—Buxted Park, an old deer park which is very important for the conservation of invertebrates. Buxted Park is now a country house hotel, owned by Hand Picked Hotels around which there are some lovely walks. The wholesale Buxted Chickens had a factory in Buxted as well as one in Five Ash Down. Buxted Chickens was founded by Antony Fisher, who also founded the Institute of Economic Affairs. The Buxted brand, formerly owned by the Grampian Country Foods, is now owned by 2 Sisters Food Group. The Buxted site closed down in the 1980s, and is now owned by the Woodland Trust. Religion The original parish church, St Margaret the Queen, is located in Buxted Park and was built in 1250. Its dedication is to Saint Margaret of Scotland. Other churches in the parish include St Mary the Virgin, consecrated 1887, Buxted Methodist Church, built 1907 and Holy Trinity Church in High Hurstwood. In Heron's Ghyll is the Roman Catholic Grade II listed, St John the Evangelist Church. Church of St John (Roman Catholic), Buxted from British Listed Buildings, retrieved 21 March 2016 Governance Buxted Parish Hall The first, community level of government is Buxted Parish Council which meets once a month, except in August. The Parish Council is responsible for local amenities such as the provision of litter bins, bus shelters and allotments. It is also a statutory consultee on local planning applications and liaises closely with Wealden District Council on local development issues. The Parish Council works closely with WDC on safety, planning, transport and other issues and is a channel of communication between district and parish tiers of government. For elections, the parish is divided into two wards, Buxted (ten seats) and High Hurstwood Ward (five seats) and includes Five Ash Down. The May 2015 election was uncontested with 13 seats being filled. Wealden District council provides the next level of government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection. Buxted lies within the Buxted and Maresfield Ward, which provides two councillors. The May 2015 election returned two Conservative councillors. East Sussex county council is the third tier of government, providing education, libraries and highway maintenance. Buxted falls within the Buxted Maresfield district. Roy Galley, Conservative, was elected in the May 2013 election with 51.4% of the vote. The UK Parliament constituency for Buxted is Wealden. The conservative Nus Ghani was elected in the May 2015 election. At the European level, Buxted is represented by the South-East region, which holds ten seats in the European Parliament. The May 2014 election returned three Conservatives, one Liberal Democrat, four UK Independence, one Labour and one Green. Transport The A272 cross-country road passes through the village from west to east; it connects with the A22 and A26 roads about a mile (1.6 km) to the west. Buxted station lies on the Oxted Line between Uckfield and Crowborough. The line serves London at London Bridge railway station via East Croydon. Or you can change at East Croydon for Victoria.

Textual evidence indicates that the author frequently used maps as his source. The Text There are three known copies of the Cosmography in existence. The Vatican Library holds a 14th-century copy, there is a 13th-century copy in Paris at the Bibliothèque Nationale, and the library at Basle University has another 14th-century copy. The Vatican copy was used as the source for the first publication of the manuscript in 1688 by Porcheron. The German scholar Joseph Schnetz published the text in 1940, basing it on the Vatican and Paris editions, which he believed to be more reliable than the Basle edition. Parts of the text, notably that covering Britain, have been published by others, including Richmond and Crawford in 1949, but their document showed little regard for which of the manuscripts provided the information. However, it contained photographs of the relevant sections from all three manuscripts, which enabled Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews to reconstruct the text from scratch in 2013 for his reassessment of its importance for British geography. The work by Schnetz covered the whole document, and was republished in 1990. In addition to the three main manuscripts, the Vatican Library also holds a document containing excerpts from the Cosmography made by Riccobaldus Ferrariensis, and there is a copy of the Paris manuscript held in Leiden. The surviving texts are quite challenging. They consist of commentary and lists of names. The Vatican manuscript presents the text in two columns, with placenames being capitalised and terminated by a stop. A small number of the words have been abbreviated. The Paris manuscript also uses two columns, capitalisation and stops, but has many more abbreviations than either of the other two. The text is divided into sections by paragraph marks. The Basle manuscript only has a single column, and is more difficult to read than the others. It has more abbreviations than the Vatican copy, but fewer than the Paris copy. There is some evidence that the author has tried to correct or clarify words which were not clear in the original, and there are no stops to separate the place names in the lists, but there are underlined headings to divide up the sections. As an indication of the problems of dealing with the text, there are a total of 315 names in the section covering Britain. All three manuscripts agree on the spelling of 200 of these. The Basle and Vatican documents agree on the spelling of a further 50, there are 33 more common to the Basle and Paris documents, and 17 more which appear in the Paris and Vatican documents. There are 8 names for which there is no agreement between the three sources, and 7 names missing from the Paris copy where the other two agree. In a paper by Franz Staab, published in 1976, he noted that the original author claimed to have used works by three others, Athanarid, Heldebald and Marcomir, in the compilation of his own work. Stolte, writing in 1956, argued that the cosmography was finished around 732. =British section= The naming of places in Roman Britain has traditionally relied on Ptolemy’s Geography, the Antonine Itinerary and the Peutinger Table, as the Cosmography was seen as full of corruptions, with the ordering of the lists of placenames being haphazard. However, there are more entries in the Cosmography than in the other documents, and so it has been studied more recently. The antiquary Roger Gale, writing in 1709, was the first to attempt to use it as a source for Romano-British place names, but early attempts relied on the similarity between ancient and modern names, and this method was seen to be suspect by the mid-19th century. Archaeological investigations were uncovering sites that had evidence of occupation in the Roman period, and this correlation became important. The Antonine Itinerary and Richard of Cirencester's de Situ Britanniae were increasingly used to corroborate entries, until Richard's work was found to be an 18th-century hoax. The Cosmography remained relatively impenetrable until the mid-20th century. In 1949, Sir Ian Richmond and O G S Crawford published a paper they had originally submitted to Archaeologia, which suggested that the sources for the document had included maps or road books, and that many place names described geographical features. The book was seen as a significant advance in the study both of the document and of Romano-British placenames. Louis Dillemann's work, which was translated by Professor Colin Smith and published in Archaeologia in 1979, was the first time that the theories of J Schnetz had been summarised for an English-speaking audience, while A L F Rivet and Colin Smith used their study of the document to publish The Place-Names of Roman Britain in the same year. Part of the difficulty with the text is its corruption, which probably results from the author failing to understand his sources, or not appreciating the purpose for which they were written. His original sources may have been of poor quality, resulting in many curious-looking names appearing in the lists. Equally, there are some obvious omissions, although the author was not attempting to produce a complete list of places, as his introduction states: \\"In that Britain we read that there were many civitates and forts, of which we wish to name a few.\\" The suggestion that he was using maps is bolstered by phrases such as \\"next to\\" which occur frequently, and at one point he states: \\"where that same Britain is seen to be narrowest from Ocean to Ocean.\\" Richmond and Crawford were the first to argue that rather than being random, the named places are often clustered around a central point, or spread out along a single road. For most of England, the order seems to follow a series of zig-zags, but this arrangement is less obvious for the south-west and for Scotland.

The term was born in Rome, originating from the administrative divisions of the city. The word comes from the Latin word regio (pl. regiones, meaning region); during the Middle Ages the Latin word became rejones, from which rione comes. Currently, all the rioni are located in Municipio I of Rome. Ancient Rome According to tradition, Servius Tullius, sixth king of Rome, first divided the city into regiones, numbering four. During administrative reorganization after the Roman Republic collapsed, the first emperor Augustus created the 14 regiones of Rome that were to remain in effect throughout the Imperial era, as attested by the 4th-century Cataloghi regionari, that name them and provide data for each. All but Transtiberim (the modern Trastevere) were on the left bank of the river Tiber. The regions were: Middle Ages After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the decline of Rome, the population decreased and the division into regiones was lost. During the 12th century a division in 12 parts started being used, though not officially, but simply by the common use of the people. Even if the areas were different from the ancient ones, they still used the same name: regio in Latin and rione in the vulgar language. The limits of the rioni became more definitive and official in the 13th century: their number increased to 13 and it remained the same until the 16th century. In this period, anyway, the limits were quite uncertain. The rione was not a political entity, but only an administrative one. The chief of a rione was the Caporione. Modern ages During the Renaissance there was a deep reorganization and expansion of the city, so it became necessary to delimit the rioni exactly. In 1586 Sixtus V added to the 13 rioni another one: Borgo, which before had been administered separately from the city. This situation, thanks to the low population increase, did not change until the 19th century. In 1744 Pope Benedict XIV, because of frequent misunderstanding, decided to replan the administrative division of Rome, giving the responsibility of it to Count Bernardini. The marble plates defining the borders of each rione, many of which still exist, were installed in that year on the facades of houses lying at each rione's border. In 1798, during the Roman Republic, there was a rationalization of the administrative division of the city creating 12 rioni (with the modern rione in parentheses): Soon after this, during the domination of Napoleon, Rome was split up in 8 parts, now called Giustizie (meaning \\"justices\\" in Italian): So the smaller rioni were united to the large ones. At this time the French affixed in each street a plate with its name and the areas it belonged to. Today After Napoleon lost his power there were no significant changes in the organization of the city until Rome became the capital of the newborn Italy. The needs of the new capital caused a great urbanization and an increase of the population, both within the Aurelian walls and outside them. In 1874 the rioni became 15, with the addition of Esquilino, created by taking a portion from Monti. At the beginning of the 20th century some rioni started being split up and the first parts outside the Aurelian walls started being considered part of the city. In 1921 the number of the rioni increased to 22. Prati was the last rione to be established and the only one outside the walls of Urbanus VIII. The latest reform, which is still mostly valid, was made in 1972: Rome was divided in 20 circoscrizioni (later renamed municipi, one of which became later the independent municipality of Fiumicino) and 20 rioni (which together form the Centro Storico) constituted the first one, Municipio I. The two remaining, Borgo and Prati, belonged to Municipio XVII until 2013. Since then they belong with the rest of the rioni as part of Municipio I. The complete list of the modern rioni, in order of number, is the following: Coat of Arms of the modern rioni Image:Rome rione I monti (logo).svgI Monti Image:Rome_rione_II_trevi_(logo).svgII Trevi Image:Rome_rione_III_colonna_(logo).svgIII Colonna Image:Rome_rione_IV_campus_martius_(logo).svgIV Campo Marzio Image:Rome_rione_V_ponte_(logo).svgV Ponte Image:Rome_rione_VI_parione_(logo).svgVI Parione Image:Rome_rione_VII_regola_(logo).svgVII Regola Image:Rome_rione_VIII_sant_eustachio_(logo).svgVIII Sant'Eustachio Image:Rome_rione_IX_pigna_(logo).svgIX Pigna Image:Rome_rione_X_campitelli_(logo).svgX Campitelli Image:Rome_rione_XI_sant_angelo_(logo).svgXI Sant'Angelo Image:Rome_rione_XII_ripa_(logo).svgXII Ripa Image:Rome_rione_XIII_trastevere_(logo).svgXIII Trastevere Image:Rome_rione_XIV_borgo_(logo).svgXIV Borgo Image:Rome_rione_XV_esquilino_(logo).svgXV Esquilino Image:Rome_rione_XVI_ludovisi_(logo).svgXVI Ludovisi Image:Rome_rione_XVII_sallustiano_(logo).svgXVII Sallustiano Image:Rome_rione_XVIII_castro_pretorio_(logo).svgXVIII Castro Pretorio Image:Rome_rione_XIX_celio_(logo).svgXIX Celio Image:Rome_rione_XX_testaccio_(logo).svgXX Testaccio Image:Rome_rione_XXI_san_saba_(logo).svgXXI San Saba Image:Rome_rione_XXII_prati_(logo).svgXXII Prati See also * Administrative subdivision of Rome * Frazione * Località * Circoscrizione * Rione * Terziere * Quartiere * Sestiere * Contrade Sources * References External links sv:Rione#Roms rioni vi:Rione của Roma ","title":"Rioni of Rome"},{"id":"2607641","text":"Dirtdish is an album by Wiseblood.

In the early days of the Church, stripped-down Latter-Day Saint folk music, which could be sung without accompaniment due to the lack of instruments in Utah, was popular. In the 19th century, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir was created and began touring, while musicians began writing devotional and praise music with a Latter-Day Saint influence, paralleling the success of Christian Contemporary Music. Several organizations have existed and do exist to promote these artists, such as Deseret Book and the now-defunct Faith-centered Music Association. Starting in the late 20th century and to the present day, Latter-Day Saints have been increasingly involved in modern popular music in America and elsewhere in the World.  Mormon folk music  Mormon folk music constituted some of the earliest white/euroamerican music in the boundaries of modern Utah. These songs, simple and easy to remember, were usually sung without accompaniment because of the scarcity of musical instruments in territorial Utah. Although they often employed the same tunes as folk music elsewhere, Mormon folk music is distinctively Utahn. The songs often include unique pioneer-era Latter-Day Saint culture references to crossing the plains, LDS ecclesiastical leaders, and LDS religious convictions. Hymns and other folk music were used to lift the spirits of all the saints along their treacherous journey known as the Mormon Trail. They are still used as praises or prayers to their Heavenly Father as well as a way to welcome comfort, peace and guidance from the Holy Ghost whom they try to keep as a constant companion.  The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, formerly known as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir Since 1847, the Latter-day Saint influence in Utah music is manifest in the state’s most famous musical institution: The Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Named after the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah, the 300+ member choir is world-famous. The LDS Church supports the choir both for prestige and as a proselytizing tool for spreading familiarity of the church. The choir performs at least weekly at the Tabernacle for a radio program called \\"Music and the Spoken Word\\" which is the longest-running national radio program in the US. The Mormon Tabernacle choir has released innumerable albums since it first recorded in 1910.  LDS-themed popular music  Beginning in the 1960s, gospel music gained some success, and Latter-Day Saints played an integral role in the development of Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) into the 1970s. The Latter-Day Saint concept album The Plan, by The Osmonds, was arguably the first explicitly Latter-Day Saint music recording to break into mainstream popularity in the rock era, with two tracks from the album reaching the U.S. top 40. Since then, Michael McLean from Heber, Utah and Kenneth Cope in Salt Lake City have become relatively popular among mostly-older Latter-day Saints for their religiously-charged easy listening music. Music for LDS worship services is generally traditional with minimal accompaniment with piano or organ, so these musicians perform in venues other than in LDS worship services. In the 2010 and 2011, respectively, Jenny Oaks Baker and Hillary Weeks became popular contemporary Latter-Day Saint-themed inspirational recording artists. Since 2005, the Nashville Tribute Band has produced country music with an LDS theme. Especially For Youth albums Each year various artist from LDS Music are featured on an annual album called Especially for Youth (EFY), that is produced for a summer youth camp sponsored by Brigham Young University but are held at many universities across the United States. Several producers bid for the album on a 2-year cycle. The producer for the album is usually decided by EFY executive J.D. Hucks, a senior administrator for the Church Educational System's Youth & Family Programs. From 1998–Present the EFY album producer roll has been bouncing back and forth between the production duo Tyler Castleton & Staci Peters and their competitor Jim Funk & Barry Gibbons, making it difficult for independent artist and producers to participate with the album production. The EFY album has received criticism over the last decade for being \\"out of touch\\" with its targeted audience of youth ages 14–18. Opponents of this idea find that though the albums might be youth-orientated and were created to be given to youth at EFY camp, they were also intended to be wonderful and uplifting - appropriate for any age. Many Saints enjoy the peaceful music with a modern twist in their homes daily as a way of inviting the Holy Ghost and making the day feel more reverent. Also, Deseret Book has written on their website that \\"Perhaps no other collection of albums has sold better to the youth over the last decade than the EFY albums released every summer.\\" The EFY albums in the last 18 years are: *The Way To Become (2017) *What Matters Most (2016) *Here Am I (2015) *Anxiously Engaged (2014) *Firm In The Faith (2013) *Arise and Shine Forth (2012) *Believe.

In 2010, the FCMA decided to take an indefinite hiatus from workshops and the Pearl Awards. In a letter to the general public, the FCMA stated that it had grown too large of an organization and tried to accommodate too many recommendations and criticisms to continue.  In mainstream popular music  There are numerous artists active in the secular music world who are LDS, but do not write devotional or praise-style music. Prominent examples include Donny Osmond, Neon Trees, Dan Reynolds and Wayne Sermon of Imagine Dragons, Lindsey Stirling, Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker of Low, Brandon Flowers of The Killers, Gladys Knight, David Archuleta, Dallon Weekes of Panic! at the Disco, Dan Truman of Diamond Rio, Fictionist, SheDaisy, KASKADE, The Piano Guys, The Vibrant Sound, Amy Whitcomb, Jennifer Thomas (pianist), Dinah Jane Hansen of Fifth Harmony and many past and present members of The Aquabats. There have been efforts to expand the umbrella of \\"Mormon Music\\" to encompass all Latter- day Saints who write or perform music, reflecting an increasing frustration with institutions like Deseret Book that confine their musical offerings to a very narrow view of what Mormon Music is.

A UNESCO ratification to protect world culture in 1970 was the one of the earliest actions to implement ethical standards. Archaeologists conducting ethnoarchaeological research, which involves the study living people, are required to follow guidelines set by The Nuremburg Code (1947) and the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).  Human Remains  Human remains from a 1971 genocide on display at The Liberation War Museum in Dhaka, Bangladesh.A common ethical issue in modern archaeology has been the treatment of human remains found during excavations, especially those that represent the ancestors of aboriginal groups in the New World or the remains of other minority races elsewhere. In November 1990 the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was enacted, facilitating the return of certain human remains and sacred objects to lineal descendants and Native American Tribes. Where previously sites of great significance to indigenous peoples could be excavated and burials and artifacts taken to be stored in museums or sold, there is now increasing awareness of taking a more respectful approach. Technical developments in ancient DNA testing have raised more ethical questions in relation to the treatment of these human remains. The issue is not limited to indigenous human remains. Nineteenth and twentieth century burial sites investigated by archaeologists, such as First World War graves disturbed by developments, have seen the remains of people with closely connected living relatives being exhumed and taken away. Early Bronze Age IA shaft tombs disturbed by looters, Bab edh-Dhra cemetery.  Antiquities Trade  Display case of Nubian antiquities in the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Geneva. Although not formally connected with the modern discipline of archaeology, the international trade in antiquities has also raised ethical questions regarding the ownership of archaeological artifacts. The market for imported antiquities has encouraged damage to archaeological sites and often led to appeals for the recall. Famous sites such as Angkor Wat in Cambodia have experienced problems with looting. Looting often leads to loss of information as material remains are removed from their original contexts. Examples of archaeological material which has been removed from its place of origin and over which there is now controversy regarding its return include the Elgin Marbles.  Laws and Protections Across the World  = Globally = The World Archaeological Congress (WAC) is a global organization that holds a congress every four years to discuss recent publications and research as well as to update archaeological practice guidelines and policies. The WAC publishes a code of ethics for their archaeologists to follow. Some of the accords which have been adopted by the WAC code of ethics include the Dead Sea Accord, the Vermillion Accord on Human Remains, and The Tamaki Makau-rau Accord on the Display of Human Remains and Sacred Objects. The WAC has also published a separate code of ethics for the protection of The Amazon Forest Peoples. In 1970, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, held a convention in Paris on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. Many countries joined and it was put into use in 1972. = America = The Society for American Archaeology (SAA) is an organization which is dedicated the ethical practice of archaeology and the preservation of archaeological materials in America. The SAA's committee on archaeological ethics continually updates the living document titled Principles of Archaeological Ethics, which was first created in 1966. The SAA registers professional archaeologists who must agree to uphold the code of conduct while conducting research. The United States government continually passes legislation to protect archaeological materials and uphold ethical archaeological research. The Antiquities Act of 1906 established punishment for archaeological looting, ensured the governments' responsibility to preserve archaeological sites, and created guidelines for conducting archaeological research. The Historic Sites Act of 1935 further confirmed that the preservation of archaeological sites is of national concern. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 provided federal protection of archaeological sites and established the need for environmental review, ensuring that development does not destroy archaeological material. The Archaeological Resource Protection Act of 1979 states that archaeological materials must be preserved once they are discovered. The Native American Graves Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA) constitutes that museums receiving government funding must attempt to return archaeological materials to Native Americans if the natives claim the material. NAGPRA also states that native organizations must be consulted when Native American materials are found or are expected to be found. In 1990, the United States enacted the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, NAGPRA, which was a major step in the ethical treatment of graves and cultures in North America.  Around the Globe  Many archaeologists in the West today are employees of national governments or are privately employed instruments of government- derived archaeology legislation. In all cases this legislation is a compromise to some degree or another between the interests of the archaeological remains and the interests of economic development. = Germany = A question of control and ownership over the past has also been raised through the political manipulation of the archaeological record to promote nationalism and justify military invasion. A famous example is the corps of archaeologists employed by Adolf Hitler to excavate in central Europe in the hope of finding evidence for a region-wide Aryan culture. = United Kingdom = Questions regarding the ethical validity of government heritage policies and whether they sufficiently protect important remains are raised during cases such as High Speed 1 in London where burials at a cemetery at St Pancras railway station were hurriedly dug using a JCB and mistreated in order to keep an important infrastructure project on schedule. = Greece = The British Museum's possession of the Parthenon Sculptures, also called the \\"Elgin Marbles,\\" has been ethically questioned because these sculptures were removed from Greece under contested circumstances. The Parthenon marbles, also known as The Elgin Marbles, include a series of stone sculptures and friezes that were from the Parthenon in Athens, Greece. Greece was under Ottoman rule at the time when Thomas Bruce, 7th Lord of Elgin, or Lord Elgin, as British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire asked that he be able to take some of the marbles to a safer place and was granted that in 1801. They were sold in 1816 to the British Museum, and Parliament paid £350,000 for the marbles. Greece has been petitioning to have the marbles returned since 1924, claiming that they were illegally obtained since they were occupied by a foreign force and were not acting in line with the people of Greece.  Preservation  Another issue is the question of whether unthreatened archaeological remains should be excavated (and therefore destroyed) or preserved intact for future generations to investigate with potentially less invasive technology. Some archaeological guidance such as PPG 16 has established a strong ethical argument for only excavating sites threatened with destruction. New technology such as laser scanning has pioneered non-invasive techniques for recording petroglyphs and engravings. Other technology like GPS and Google Earth has revolutionized the way archaeologists find and record potential archaeological sites.  Ethics in Ethnoarchaeology  Ethnoarchaeology, which is the study of living people for archaeological purposes, is sometimes used in conjunction with traditional archaeology. Ethnoarchaeology presents a unique case, because it deals with the study of people, which is heavily regulated. Any research dealing with humans must be submitted to an ethics committee for approval under The Nuremburg Code (1947) and the Declaration of Helsinki (1964). Researchers must also obtain informed consent from their research subjects. Archaeologists conducting ethnoarchaeology or other types of research involving humans must adhere to a certain code in order to conduct legal and ethical research, however, this code is the same that is followed by medical research. There is no specific code for archaeological research involving humans. This has been problematic and some archaeologists resist following a medical ethics code by claiming that medical research and ethnographic research are too different to follow the same code.

Green was a write-in United States presidential candidate in 1960 and 1972. Newspaper advertisement for Gabriel Green's 1960 presidential campaign.  Biography  Green claimed to have graduated with a PhD in physics from UC Berkeley in 1953, and to have made several important contributions to the Standard Model of elementary particles, but Berkeley has no record of his attendance, and his actual educational background seems to have been acquired at Woodbury Business College in Los Angeles. For much of his life he worked as a photographer for the Los Angeles school system. Green is among the well-known 1950s UFO contactees – individuals who claimed to have met and talked with friendly humanoid Space Brothers from other worlds, and to have ridden in their spacecraft, or visited their planets. He founded the California-based Amalgamated Flying Saucer Clubs of America, Inc. in 1957, approximately at the same time he announced his meeting with flying saucer crewmen from the hitherto unknown planet Korendor, orbiting the triple star Alpha Centauri. It has also been claimed that Korendor is orbiting the star Korena. Louize, Lucus.

Scribd.com. 2019. Pp 52. Like George Adamski and several other contactees of the period, he said he was able to maintain continual telepathic links with the wise and helpful extraterrestrials he had met. In his 1960 run for US president, he claimed to represent the Universal Flying Saucer Party, and to base his political philosophy on \\"United World Universal Economics.\\" He also ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1962 in California, claiming to have accumulated over 171,000 votes. In 1967 he published his only book, Let's Face Facts about Flying Saucers. In 1972 he ran again, this time in Iowa, for US president, collecting less than 200 votes. Like most if not all of the 1950s contactees, Green was evidently far more interested in New Age/Theosophical topics such as reincarnation, channelling, Spiritualism and psychic phenomena than he was in being a prophet expounding wisdom supposedly acquired from friendly space- alien contacts. Also—like most of the more obscure contactees—he eventually dropped out of sight, moving to the vicinity of Yucca Valley, California after his last run for president, and very seldom thereafter appearing in public until his death nearly three decades later.

It is over long. The lake is surrounded by many snow-capped mountains and is fed by numerous small streams. The lake has an outlet stream at its far western end and means turquoise in English due to its color. Around 90 km to the west of the lake lies the Tibetan town of Gyantse and Lhasa is a hundred km to the northeast. According to local mythology, Yamdok Yumtso lake is the transformation of a goddess. The Yamdrok Hydropower Station was completed and dedicated in 1996 near the small village of Baidi at the lake’s western end. This power station is the largest in Tibet. Physical data Yamdrok Lake (at the top) and Lake Puma Yumco from space, November 1997 The lake (638 km² in area, 30 meters average depth and 60 meters at its deepest) is fan-shaped, spreading to the south but narrowing up to the north. The mountainous lakeshore is highly crenellated, with numerous bays and inlets. Lake Yamdrok freezes in winter. Climate Yamdrok Lake has a cold steppe climate (BSk) with long, cold, very dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. It is also bordering on an alpine tundra climate (ET) and on a subarctic climate (Dwc). The differences between day and night are great. Cultural significance Yamdrok Lake in summer A view of the serene Yamdrok Lake with a yak in the foreground Like mountains, lakes are considered sacred by Tibetan people, the principle being that they are the dwelling places of protective deities and therefore invested with special spiritual powers. Yamdrok Lake is one of four particularly holy lakes, thought to be divinatory; everyone from the Dalai Lama to local villagers makes pilgrimages there. It is considered sacred as one of the four \\"Great Wrathful Lakes\\" guarded by the goddess Dorje Gegkyi Tso. The others such lakes are Lhamo La-tso, Namtso and Manasarovar. The lake is revered as a talisman and is said to be part of the life-spirit of Tibet. The largest lake in southern Tibet, it is said that if its waters dry, Tibet will no longer be habitable. The lake, its islands, and the surrounding area are closely associated with Padmasambhava, the Second Buddha, who brought Buddhism to Tibet in 8th century AD. The lake is home to the famous Samding Monastery which is on a peninsula jutting into the lake. This monastery is the only Tibetan monastery to be headed by a female re-incarnation. Since it is not a nunnery, its female abbot heads a community of about thirty monks and nuns. Samding Monastery is where Samding Dorje Phagmo, the most important female incarnate Lama in Tibet, stayed and presided, and stands to the south of Lake Yamdrok Yumtso. Today, both pilgrims and tourists can be seen walking along the lake's perimeter. One of the lake's islands contains an old fort or castle called Pede Dzong. Economic significance There are shoals of fish living in Yamdrok Lake, which are commercially exploited by local population. From April to October, fish caught from this lake are sold at markets in Lhasa, Tibet's capital. Additionally, the lake's islands serve as rich pasture land to local herdsmen.

Portrait of Loammi Baldwin jr. by Chester Harding Biography Baldwin was born at North Woburn, Massachusetts living at Baldwin House aka \\"The Baldwin Mansion\\", educated at Westford Academy, and graduated from Harvard College in 1800. His early inclinations were towards mechanical subjects, and during his college life he made a clock which kept good time. In 1794 at age 14 he accompanied his father and two brothers (Cyrus, 22, and Benjamin, 17) on a nine-day consulting inspection visit from the famous canal engineer William Weston of the route of the Middlesex Canal. Later all five of Loammi Baldwin Senior's sons ( Loammi Baldwin Jr., Benjamin Franklin Baldwin, Cyrus Baldwin, James Fowle Baldwin and George Rumford Baldwin) worked with their father on the ten-year construction of the Middlesex Canal. After graduation, he entered a law office in Groton, Massachusetts, where he constructed a fire engine called \\"Torrent\\", which the town greatly needed. In 1804 he completed his studies at Groton and opened his own law office in Cambridge. In 1807, however, he abandoned his law practice in favor of engineering. He traveled to England to inspect public works and intended to do the same in France, but he was barred by the difficulty in entering the country. Upon his return he began an engineering practice in Charlestown, Massachusetts. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1810, and a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory One of his earliest engineering works was the construction of Fort Strong (1814), a fort in Boston Harbor built for defense against the British. He served as chief engineer with the rank of Colonel, a title which has sometimes confused him with his father. In 1819 he was asked to complete the construction of the Milldam, now that stretch of Beacon Street beyond the Boston Common. From 1817 to 1820, he worked in Virginia, and in 1821 was made engineer of the Union Canal in Pennsylvania. In 1824 Baldwin returned to Europe and remained there a year, mostly in France, examining public works. In 1825 he joined a small committee planning the Bunker Hill Monument and recommended the obelisk now seen there. In 1827 he accepted an appointment from the United States government which led to the two great works of his life (1827-1834): the naval dry docks at the Boston Navy Yard in Charlestown and at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth. Baldwin led many other projects such as a marine railway at Pensacola; construction of buildings at Harvard College; a canal around the Ohio River falls; a stone bridge called the Warren Bridge at Charlestown; and the Union Canal in Pennsylvania. Baldwin was twice married; first to Ann, daughter of George Williams, of Salem. She was sister of Samuel Williams, an eminent American banker in London; second on June 22, 1828, to Catherine, widow of Captain Thomas Beckford, of Charlestown. She died May 3, 1864. Child by first marriage: Samuel Williams Baldwin, born 1817, died December 28, 1822. About a year before he died he had a stroke of paralysis; a second attack proved fatal. He died at Charlestown, Massachusetts on June 30, 1838, at the age of fifty-eight, and was buried in Woburn. After Loammi's stroke and death his brother, James Fowle Baldwin (1782-1862), with whom he had often worked, continued his work especially for a safe water supply for Boston.

From 1648 to 1665, he was the ruler of the Principality of Calenberg as an appanage from his eldest brother, Christian Louis, Prince of Luneburg. When he inherited Luneburg on the latter's death in 1665, he gave Calenberg to his younger brother, John Frederick. Nevertheless, he only kept the sub-division of Celle, giving the rest of Luneburg to their youngest brother Ernest Augustus, whose son, George Ludwig (future King of Great Britain), inherited Saxe-Lauenburg and Celle from George William. His only daughter, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, was George Ludwig's wife. Biography Portrait of Georg Wilhelm after Anselm van Hulle by Pieter de Jode II George William was the second son of George, Prince of Calenberg. He had an elder brother, two younger brothers, and several sisters, including Queen Sophia Amalie of Denmark. =Succession= In 1648, when George William's elder brother, Christian Louis, Prince of Calenberg, inherited the Principality of Lüneburg from their paternal uncle, Frederick IV, he gave Calenberg to George William in appanage. Seventeen years later, in 1665, Christian Louis himself died childless, and George William inherited Luneburg as well. He then gave Calenberg to his next brother, John Frederick. The renunciation of claim to Luneburg had in fact happened seven years previously, in 1658. In exchange for being freed from the obligation to marry Princess Sophia of the Palatinate, George William ceded his claim on inheriting Lüneburg to his youngest brother Ernest Augustus, settling for the smaller duchy of Celle and promising to remain unmarried so that he would produce no legitimate heir who might pose a challenge to his brother's claim to Luneburg. The absence of heirs would also mean that Celle would lapse back into Luneburg; Celle was only supposed to give George William an income for his lifetime. After reaching this agreement, George William's youngest brother, Ernest Augustus, married Sophia and became the Duke of Hanover. =Marriage and issue= This renunciation left George William free to marry whoever he wished, and indulge his desires to travel and socialize, without being encumbered by considerations of state. In 1665, George William entered into a morganatic marriage with his long-time mistress, Eleanor, Countess of Wilhelmsburg. In 1666, their only child and daughter, Sophia Dorothea, was born. By 1676, it had become quite clear that among the four brothers (George William and three others), only the youngest, Ernest Augustus had produced any heirs male, and that the entire duchy of Luneburg was likely to be united under Ernest Augustus's eldest son George Louis. George William therefore wanted George Louis to marry his daughter Sophia, whose marriage prospects were otherwise not bright, given the circumstances of her birth. To George William's annoyance, George Louis and his parents refused the proposal on the grounds of status. At this point (in 1676),to improve the status of his mistress and daughter, and in open violation of his promise, George William legitimized his daughter and declared that his marriage to Eleonore was not morganatic but valid to both church and state. This development greatly alarmed his relatives, as it threatened to hinder the contemplated union of the Lüneburg territories. Indeed, if George William had had a son, a serious succession crisis could have arisen. No son however was born, and in 1682, George Louis' parents finally agreed to the proposed marriage as a way of avoiding uncertainty and dispute. Sophia married George Louis in 1682. They had a son and heir the following year, named George after his father and maternal grandfather: the future George II of Britain. =Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg= In 1689, Julius Francis, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg died leaving no son and no accepted heir male, but only two daughters, Anna and Mary. The duchy had followed the Salic law since time immemorial, but Duke Julius Francis decided to nominate his elder daughter as his heir and proclaimed laws permitting female succession in his duchy. This self-serving innovation was not accepted by senior members of his dynasty (the other potential successors) and a succession crisis ensued. George William was one of the nearest and senior-most male-line claimants to the succession. Shortly after the death of the duke, George William invaded the duchy with his troops and occupied it. The other claimants included the five Ascanian-ruled Principalities of Anhalt, Saxony, Saxe-Wittenberg, Sweden and Brandenburg, and also the neighbouring Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the Danish duchy of Holstein, whose ruler was the King of Denmark. However, only George William and Christian V of Denmark (whose mother was George William's own sister) engaged militarily on this question. An accord was soon reached between them, and on 9 October 1693 they agreed (in the Hamburg Comparison, or Hamburger Vergleich) that George William - who now de facto held most of Saxe-Lauenburg - would retain the duchy in a personal union. Meanwhile, the Emperor Leopold I, who had no direct claim on the duchy, occupied the Land of Hadeln, a Saxe- Lauenburgian exclave, and held it in imperial custody. Apart from that, Leopold did not attempt to use force in Saxe-Lauenburg. In 1728, his son the Emperor Charles VI finally legitimised the de facto takeover and enfeoffed George William's grandson and second successor, George II of Great Britain (who was also Elector of Hanover) with the duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, but Hadeln remained in imperial custody until 1731, when it was also ceded to George II Augustus. =Other military feats= During the Swedish-Brandenburg War, George William participated from 1675 to 1676 in the campaign against Bremen- Verden as commander-in-chief of the allied forces against Sweden.

This unsaturated imide is an important building block in organic synthesis. The name is a contraction of maleic acid and imide, the -C(O)NHC(O)- functional group. Maleimides also describes a class of derivatives of the parent maleimide where the NH group is replaced with alkyl or aryl groups such as a methyl or phenyl, respectively. The substituent can also be a small molecule (such as biotin, a fluorescent dye, an oligosaccharide a nucleic acid), a reactive group, or a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene glycol. Human hemoglobin chemically modified with maleimide-polyethylene glycol is a blood substitute called MP4. Organic chemistry Maleimide and its derivatives are prepared from maleic anhydride by treatment with amines followed by dehydration. A special feature of the reactivity of maleimides is their susceptibility to additions across the double bond either by Michael additions or via Diels-Alder reactions. Bismaleimides are a class of compounds with two maleimide groups connected by the nitrogen atoms via a linker, and are used as crosslinking reagents in thermoset polymer chemistry. Compounds containing a maleimide group linked with another reactive group, such as an activated N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, are called maleimide heterobifunctional reagents (for example, see SMCC reagent). Natural maleimides Only a handful of natural maleimides – exemplified by the cytotoxic showdomycin from Streptomyces showdoensis, and pencolide from Pe. multicolor – have been reported. Farinomalein was first isolated in 2009 from the entomopathogenic fungus Isaria farinosa (Paecilomyces farinosus) – source H599 (Japan).Sastia P. Putri, Hiroshi Kinoshita, Fumio Ihara, Yasuhiro Igarashi and Takuya Nihira. \\"Farinomalein, a Maleimide-Bearing Compound from the Entomopathogenic Fungus Paecilomyces farinosus\\". J. Nat. Prod., 2009, 72 (8), pp. 1544–1546. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications Maleimide-mediated methodologies are among the most used in bioconjugation. Due to exceptionally fast reaction rates and significantly high selectivity towards cysteine residues in proteins, a large variety of maleimide heterobifunctional reagents are used for the preparation of targeted therapeutics, assemblies for studying proteins in their biological context, protein-based microarrays, or proteins immobilisation. For instance, emerging promising targeted drug therapies, antibody-drug conjugates, are constituted of three main components: a monoclonal antibody, a cytotoxic drug, and a linker molecule often containing a maleimide group, which binds the drug and the antibody. Maleimides linked to polyethylene glycol chains are often used as flexible linking molecules to attach proteins to surfaces. The double bond readily reacts with the thiol group found on cysteine to form a stable carbon-sulfur bond. Attaching the other end of the polyethylene chain to a bead or solid support allows for easy separation of protein from other molecules in solution, provided these molecules do not also possess thiol groups. Maleimide-functionalised polymers and liposomes exhibit enhanced ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces (mucoadhesion) due to the reactions with thiol-containing mucins. This could be applicable in the design of dosage forms for transmucosal drug delivery. Technological applications Mono- and bismaleimide-based polymers are used for high temperature applications up to 250 °C. Maleimides linked to rubber chains are often used as flexible linking molecules to reinforce the rubber (tire). The double bond readily reacts with all hydroxy, amine or thiol groups found on the matrix to form a stable carbon-oxygen, carbon-nitrogen, or carbon-sulfur bond, respectively. Lockheed Martin's F-35B (a STOVL version of this US fighter) is reportedly composed of bismaleimide materials, in addition to the use of advanced carbon fiber thermoset polymer matrix composites.

Construction started in 1897 and was completed in 1905. It is part of the Nashua River Watershed. This dam is part of greater Boston's water system, maintained and controlled by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). Its discharge is into the Nashua River. When it was completed in 1905, the Wachusett Reservoir was the largest public water supply reservoir in the world.History: Wachusett At that time, the Wachusett Reservoir Dam was the largest gravity dam in the world as well. Construction The Metropolitan Water Board selected the south branch of the Nashua River in Clinton as the best site for Boston's new water supply over New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee, Maine's Sebago Lake, and the Merrimack River. Churches, factories, homes, and schools within the valley had to be knocked down or moved. Roads and rail lines had to be relocated; a railroad tunnel and trestle had to be built in order to relocate the Central Massachusetts Railroad, and over four thousand bodies had to be dug up and moved in the local Catholic cemetery. The project brought thousands of immigrants to the area for work. The dam created the world's largest water supply reservoir at the time. It is still considered the largest \\"hand dug\\" dam in the world today. Early problems A static liquefaction flow failure occurred in the upstream slope of the North Dike of Wachusett Dam near Clinton, Massachusetts on April 11, 1907 during the first reservoir filling. The fine sands of the upstream dike shell liquefied and flowed approximately 100 meters horizontally into the reservoir.

He served as head coach at the University of Houston from 2016 to 2018, where he previously served as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. In 2013, he was the co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Texas under his head coach as a player, Mack Brown. Prior to Texas, Applewhite served as offensive coordinator at Rice University under Todd Graham in 2006 and at Alabama under Nick Saban in 2007. He was the youngest offensive coordinator among Division I-A schools at that time. Applewhite was previously the quarterbacks coach at Syracuse University in 2005. Prior to coaching, he was a college football quarterback for the Texas Longhorns from 1998 to 2001 and set 8 school records. Many of these still stand, including the longest pass play (97 yards), and most yards passing in a game (473). He previously held the record for career yards (8,353) and consecutive passes without an interception (156). Playing career Applewhite was a quarterback for the Texas Longhorns from 1998 to 2001. Recruited from Catholic High School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana by then Texas coach John Mackovic, he was later coached by Mack Brown. While at Texas, the undersized Applewhite's tenure was noted both for his often gritty heroics as well as his battle for playing time with the heralded blue chip recruit Chris Simms, son of New York Giants legend Phil Simms. Applewhite led Texas to two Big 12 Championship games, to victory in 2 Bowl games, and set 48 school records along the way. After redshirting the 1997 season, an injury to starting quarterback Richard Walton catapulted Applewhite into the starting job two games into his redshirt freshman season in 1998. Applewhite went 8–2 as a starter, including upsets of #7 Nebraska 20–16, which broke the Cornhuskers' 47-home game winning streak, and #6 Texas A&M.; In a blowout victory over Oklahoma, Applewhite threw a 97-yard touchdown pass to Wane McGarity, the longest pass in Texas history. He capped the season by leading the Longhorns to a 38–11 victory over the Mississippi State Bulldogs in the Cotton Bowl Classic. It was Texas' first Cotton Bowl victory since 1982. In 1999, Applewhite started almost every game, leading Texas to a 9–4 record, a Big 12 South Championship and the Cotton Bowl. Going into the Texas A&M; game (often referred to as the Bonfire Game, as it followed the death of 12 students during construction of A&M;'s annual bonfire). Texas was ranked #5, but after Applewhite and backup quarterback Chris Simms was unable to produce Texas fell behind. It was during the last six minutes when Applewhite fumbled on their last possession losing the game for the Longhorns. That was followed by losses to Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game and to Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. Applewhite suffered a knee injury in the 4th quarter of the Cotton Bowl and was replaced by Simms. The next season Applewhite was again the starter, but after a loss to Stanford in the second game, Simms was given the start the following game against Houston. Simms struggled early and Applewhite got the majority of the snaps in what turned out to be a rout, thus regaining the starting job. He lost it again following a season-ending knee injury in the Texas Tech game. At that point Texas was 7–2 and ranked #19. Texas went 2–1 with Simms as quarterback, and Mack Brown was impressed enough to name Simms the starter before spring practice began. Applewhite was the backup for Simms for the entirety of the 2001 regular season and Simms led Texas to a #3 ranking and a trip to the Big 12 Championship against #10 Colorado. But in that game Applewhite got the opportunity to go out as a starter and a hero. Because of an upset loss by Florida earlier in the day, Texas went into that game knowing that a win would put them in the BCS Championship Game. But Simms had a disastrous game and was responsible for four turnovers (three interceptions and a fumble) in the first half of play. Meanwhile, Major was seen attempting to rally the offense before they took to the field, even as the restless Texas fans booed Simms. Two plays later, Simms injured his finger and Applewhite entered the game with Texas down 29–10. His second pass was completed for a 79-yard touchdown and he baited the University of Colorado bench in an attempt to rally the Texas fans. He led Texas back to within two points, but eventually Texas would come up short losing 39–37 after an onside kick attempt failed. His near miracle comeback, combined with Simms' injury, earned him the starting position for his final game at Texas, the 2001 Holiday Bowl and he didn't disappoint. In perhaps his finest game, he led Texas from behind three times throwing for a school record 473 yards and four touchdowns. In a fourth quarter aerial assault, Texas scored 23 points in a little over 10 minutes to take the lead, but Washington came back to take the lead once more. With 1:49 left in the game, Applewhite engineered a 7-play, 80-yard touchdown drive with passes of 25 and 37 yards to win the game. Applewhite was named the Holiday Bowl MVP as a result. He finished with a record as a starter of 22–8. Applewhite played in the 2001 Hula Bowl. After graduation, Applewhite was signed by the New England Patriots days after the 2002 NFL Draft, but quit prior to the start of camp to finish his degree and to pursue a career in coaching. =Records= *Cotton Bowl - Most completions, career, surpassed by Graham Harrell in 2009 *UT-Passing yards, game (473) - broke his own record. *UT-Passing yards, bowl game (473) *UT-Passing yards by a freshman, game (408) *UT-Passing yards, season (3,357), surpassed by Colt McCoy in 2008 *UT-Passing yards by a freshman (2,453), surpassed by McCoy in 2008 *UT-Passing yards, career (8,353), surpassed by McCoy in 2008, also set the Big 12 record, surpassed by Kliff Kingsbury in 2002 *UT-Completions by a freshman, game (29) *UT-Completions, season (271), surpassed by McCoy in 2007 *UT-Completions, career (611), surpassed by McCoy in 2008 *UT-Highest Completion Percentage (min 100 attempts) (65.3%), season, broke his own record, surpassed by McCoy in 2008 *UT-Attempts, season (467), surpassed by McCoy in 2009 *UT-Attempts, career (1065), surpassed by McCoy in 2009 *UT- Touchdown Passes by a freshman (18), surpassed by McCoy in 2006 *UT-Touchdown Passes, career (60), surpassed by McCoy in 2009 *UT-Touchdown Passes, bowl game (4) *UT-Total Offense, bowl game (476 yards) *UT-Total Offense, Game (476 yards), broke his own record, surpassed by Vince Young *UT-Total Offense, Season (3,211 yards), surpassed by Young *UT-Total Offense, Career (8,059 yards), surpassed by Young *UT-Most 300 yard total offense games, season (4), surpassed by Young *UT-Most 300 yard total offense games, career (8), tied James Brown, surpassed by Young *UT-Most 400 yard total offense games, season (1), tied by Chris Simms, surpassed by Young *UT-Most 400 yard total offense games, career (1), tied by Simms, surpassed by Young *UT-Most 400 yard passing games, season (1), tied by Simms and McCoy *UT-Most 400 yard passing games, career (2), tied by McCoy *UT-Fastest to 1,000 yards in a single season (4 games), tied with McCoy, James Brown and David Ash *UT-Fastest to 2,000 yards in a single season (7 games) *UT-Consecutive passes without an interception (156), surpassed by Sam Ehlinger *UT-Consecutive games with a touchdown (19) *UT-Consecutive 200 yard games, season (11) *UT-Consecutive 200 yard games, career (21) *UT-Lowest percentage of passes intercepted (minimum 300 passes), career (2.6%) *UT-Victories by a freshman (8), surpassed by McCoy in 2006 *UT- Longest scoring play (97 yards) *UT-Games by a quarterback, career (45), surpassed by McCoy in 2009 *UT-Longest pass play (97 yards) *Big 12 Longest pass play (97 yards), tied Michael Bishop *Big 12 & UT-Longest pass play by a freshman (97 yards) *Big 12 & UT-Longest pass play by a sophomore (96 yards) (also tied for 2nd longest pass ever at UT and 3rd in Big 12) *Big 12-Passing yards, career (8,353), surpassed by Kliff Kingsbury in 2002 Bold means active Coaching career Returning to Texas as a graduate assistant, Applewhite served in that position until early 2005 when he was offered the position of quarterbacks coach at Syracuse University by new head coach Greg Robinson, Texas' former defensive coordinator. Applewhite's first coaching job was a disaster, with the Orange going 1-10, their worst record in school history (after 6-6 the year before) and scoring their fewest points in more than 20 years (from 22.8 points in 2004 to 13.8 points in 2005). On January 8, 2006, after one year at Syracuse, Rice University named Applewhite offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under new head coach Todd Graham. Graham said of Applewhite's expected contribution to the new staff, \\"We want to spread the field and throw the football, and every quarterback and receiver in this state will be interested in Rice with Major as our offensive coordinator.\\" At Rice, Applewhite moved the team away from the wishbone offense and moved them to a more modern, one-running-back formation similar to that used by Texas. During his one season at Rice, the team posted a 7–6 record and attended its first bowl game in over forty years. After former Texas defensive coordinator Gene Chizik was hired as head coach at Iowa State University in December 2006, Applewhite was rumored to be joining his coaching staff. Applewhite, however, officially announced on December 4, 2006, that he would not leave Rice for Iowa State. He did however leave Rice only a month later, not for Iowa State but for Alabama, as he accepted an offer by newly hired Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban to serve as the offensive coordinator. Given his ties to the Lone Star State, Applewhite targeted a couple of Texas high school prospects, including Lennon Creer. Alabama eventually received commitments by quarterback Nick Fanuzzi and defensive back Tarence Farmer. In his first season at Alabama, Applewhite improved the Crimson Tide offense, which had averaged 22.3 points and 340.9 total yards per game under Dave Rader in 2006, to an average of 26.8 points and 372.6 total yards per game in 2007. Following a 41-17 blowout win over SEC rival Tennessee on October 20, Applewhite was named \\"Offensive Coordinator of the Week.\\" Alabama, however, then lost the last four games of the season, including a shocking 21-14 loss to Louisiana-Monroe. During the 2007 season, Applewhite was mentioned as a possible replacement for Art Briles as head coach at the University of Houston. Briles had left Houston for Baylor University. Applewhite, however, withdrew his name from the candidates list. On January 16, 2008, Applewhite accepted an offer to become running backs coach at the University of Texas and he also served as assistant head coach to Mack Brown.\\"Longhorns hire former QB great Applewhite\\" . Alan Trubow, Kirk Bohls (January 17, 2008), Austin American-Statesman. Applewhite was announced as the co-offensive coordinator on January 6, 2011. The next day, Mack Brown announced that the primary play caller and other co-offensive coordinator would be Bryan Harsin from Boise State. Harsin was named head coach at Arkansas State University on December 12, 2012, and Applewhite assumed play calling duties at Texas and coached quarterbacks. He was co-offensive coordinator with wide receivers coach Darrell Wyatt. At the start of 2014, following the hiring of new Texas head coach Charlie Strong, Applewhite accepted a one-year severance package and resigned as offensive coordinator with Texas. =University of Houston= On January 8, 2015, Applewhite was hired by the University of Houston to be the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under new head coach Tom Herman for the Houston Cougars football program. On December 9, 2016, Applewhite was promoted to head coach, becoming the 14th to hold the job for the program. After going 0–3 in bowl games and losing 70–14 against Army, he was fired on December 30, 2018. After his firing, Applewhite returned to Alabama as an analyst. Head coaching record =Notes=  Personal  In early 2013, Applewhite admitted he was disciplined by the University of Texas for \\"having an inappropriate relationship with a student at the 2009 Fiesta Bowl.\\" The student was employed by the football team as an athletic trainer. Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds reprimanded Applewhite by freezing his salary and requiring him to undergo counseling. In a public statement Applewhite commented on the affair: \\"Several years ago, I made a regretful decision resulting in behavior that was totally inappropriate. It was a one-time occurrence and was a personal matter. ... Through counsel I have worked with my wife and the incident is behind us. I am regretful for my mistake and humbled by this experience. I am deeply sorry for the embarrassment it has caused my friends, family, and the University.\\" The revelation occurred in the wake of investigation into Texas track coach Beverly Kearney's relationship with a student athlete.

I, located in Municipio I. The name literally means \\"mountains\\" in Italian and comes from the fact that the Esquiline, the Viminal Hills, and parts of the Quirinal and the Caelian Hills belonged to this rione: currently, however, the Esquiline Hill belongs to the rione Esquilino. The coat of arms consists of three green mountains with three tops on a silver background.  History  In ancient times the rione was densely populated: in Monti there were the Forum Romanum and the so-called Suburra: this was the place poor people lived, full of disreputable locals and brothels. In the Middle Ages the situation was completely different: the Roman aqueducts were damaged, and it was very difficult to bring water to Monti since it was on the hills. Hence many inhabitants moved to Campus Martius, a lower level part, where they could drink the water from the river Tiber. From the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 19th century, the rione remained an area full of vineyards and vegetable gardens. Monti was not densely populated because of the lack of water and because it was quite far from the Vatican, the center of Christian culture. The area did not become abandoned thanks to the church of San Giovanni in Laterano and the constant high number of pilgrims. Still in the Middle Ages the inhabitants of Monti, called monticiani, developed a strong identity: their Roman dialect was different from that spoken in the other rioni. Their main enemies were the people from the other rione with a strong identity, Trastevere, and they often used to fight with one another. Then, with growing urbanization at the end of the 19th century after Rome had become the capital of a united Italy, the great changes of the Fascist period completely changed the appearance of the rione. In particular, between 1924 and 1936, a large part of the rione, consisting of small streets and popular houses, was destroyed to make way for the Via dei Fori Imperiali (the street artificially dividing the Roman Forum and most of the Imperial forums) and the archaeological buildings of the Forum Romanum were excavated. Thanks to its position, Monti is full of archaeological sites such as: * Colosseum * Ludus Magnus (the gym for gladiators) * Nero's Domus Aurea * the baths of Trajan * the baths of Titus * part of the Forum Romanum * markets of Trajan  Geography  =Boundaries= To the north, the rione borders with Trevi (R. II), from which it is separated by the Foro Traiano, Via IV Novembre, Largo Magnanapoli, Via XXIV Maggio and Via del Quirinale; and with Castro Pretorio (R. XVIII), the boundary being defined by Via delle Quattro Fontane, Via Agostino Depretis, Piazza dell'Esquilino and Via dell'Esquilino. To the east, the rione borders with Esquilino (R. XV): the boundary is marked by Piazza di Santa Maria Maggiore, Via Merulana, Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano and Piazza di Porta San Giovanni. To the south, it is separated from Quartiere Appio-Latino (Q. IX) by the stretch of the Aurelian Walls between Porta San Giovanni and Porta Metronia. To the west, Monti borders with Celio (R. XIX), whose boundary is marked by Piazza di Porta Metronia, Via della Navicella, Via di Santo Stefano Rotondo, Via di San Giovanni in Laterano and Piazza del Colosseo; it also borders with Campitelli (R. X), whose boundary is marked by Via dei Fori Imperiali.

It was named after York Factory, the headquarters of the HBC, and modeled after the Orkney yole (itself a descendant of the Viking longship). Two variations to the York Boat were scows and \\"Sturgeon Heads.\\"Barkwell, Lawrence. https://www.scribd.com/document/99580756/York-Boats-Scows-and-Sturgeon-Heads History and Economics A York boat in use in 1910 York boats were preferred as cargo carriers to the birchbark canoes used by the North West Company, because they were larger, carried more cargo and were safer in rough water. The boat's heavy wood construction was a significant advantage when travelling waterways where the bottom or sides of the hull were likely to strike rocks or ice. Canoes then were commonly constructed with soft hulls of birch bark or animal hide and were vulnerable to tears and punctures. The solid, all-wood hull of the York boat could simply bounce off or grind past obstacles that could easily inflict fatal damage on a soft-hulled vessel. That advantage became a disadvantage, though, when portaging was necessary. The boat was far too heavy to carry and the crew had to cut a path through the brush, lay poplar rollers and drag the boat overland. Crewing a York boat was an arduous task, and those who chose this life faced \\"unending toil broken only by the terror of storms,\\" according to Sir John Franklin. The York boat had a length of about and the largest could carry more than of cargo. It had a pointed bow, a flat bottom, and a stern angled upward at 45°, making beaching and launching easier. The boat was propelled by oars and by a square canvas sail. It was steered by a long steering pole or, when under sail, by a rudder. It had a crew of between six and eight men. The first boat was built in 1749, and by the late 18th century there were boat-building stations from James Bay to Fort Chipewyan. The advent of the steamboat in the 19th century signalled the end for the York boat. The very narrow Echimamish River flows from the Nelson River to the Hayes River, which thus connects Norway House, Manitoba with York Factory on Hudson Bay at the mouth of the Hayes. In some places the Echimamish is so narrow that the oars of the York boats touched the ground on either side. The route included portages around rapids on the Hayes of up to . Crews hauled a York boat long and up to of supplies or cargo. =A related boat: the bateau or Columbia boat= Boats similar but smaller and lighter than the York boat, called the Columbia boat, were made specifically for use in the Columbia District and constructed on the Columbia River and its tributaries, where falls and rapids made portaging necessary. In 1811 the American Pacific Fur Company introduced the use of bateaux on the Columbia River, made of split or sawn cedar. After the NWC took over the PFC, they quickly started using bateaux because birch bark suitable for canoes was not available in the Pacific Northwest. In the 1830s John Dunn of the HBC described the Columbia District bateaux as \\"made from quarter-inch pine board, and are thirty-two feet long, and six and a half feet wide in midships, with both ends sharp, and without a keel—worked, according to the circumstances of the navigation, with paddles, or with oars.\\" U.S. Navy Lt. Charles Wilkes, who visited the Pacific Northwest in 1841, described Columbia boats as having \\"great strength and buoyancy, carry three tons weight, and have a crew of eight men, besides a padroon. They are thirty feet long and five and a half feet beam, sharp at both ends, clinker-built, and have no knees. In building them, flat timbers of oak are bent to the requisite shape by steaming; they are bolted to a flat keel, at distances of a foot from each other. The planks are of cedar, and generally extend the whole length of the boat. The gunwale is of the same kind of wood, but the rowlocks are of birch. The peculiarity in the construction of these boats is, that they are only riveted at each end with a strong rivet, and being well gummed, they have no occasion for nailing. They answer, and indeed are admirably adapted to, all the purposes for which they are intended; are so light as to be easily transported over the portages by their crews, and in case of accident are easily repaired.\\" =Current uses= York boat under construction showing use of heavy materials. A York boat was featured in the Hayes River program of Great Canadian Rivers series on TVO in 2001. The documentary shows a reconstructed boat, the Maryann Muminawatum, rowed from Norway House by eight rowers, a coxwain, and a steersman. Unlike the Hudson's Bay reconstruction, the replica York boat in this video shows crudely carved oars that are unnecessarily heavy while no stronger than a regular oar, as the midsection is left as a beam while the rowers' end tapers to a slender shaft. The Canadian TV documentary Quest for the Bay in 2002 described using a York boat to travel from Lake Winnipeg to Hudson Bay. York boat races can still be seen in Norway House, Manitoba. Racers compete for a $25,000 top prize in a celebration called Treaty & York Boat Days. In June 2011, GeoTourism Canada and Flow North Paddling Company recreated a historical expedition on the Peace River, rowing a York boat long the from Fort Dunvegan to Fort Vermilion. In 2014, three new York Boats were installed at Lower Fort Garry, National Historic Site (Manitoba). This was part of a Parks Canada, National Reconciliation with the Metis People.

It is endemic to Mona Island, Puerto Rico and is the largest native terrestrial lizard in Puerto Rico. Taxonomy The Mona ground iguana is a subspecies belonging to the genus Cyclura. It was named by Thomas Barbour and G.K. Noble as a species in 1916. In 1937, Barbour considered it to be a subspecies of Cyclura cornuta. The Mona ground iguana's specific name, cornuta, is the feminine form of the Latin adjective cornutus, meaning \\"horned\\" and refers to the horned projections on the snouts of males of the species. Its subspecific name, stejnegeri honors Leonhard Hess Stejneger, who, when writing his Herpetology of Porto Rico in 1902, suspected this was a new species. Debate continues as to whether this is a valid subspecies and not a different species in its own right. It is known in some scientific circles as Cyclura stejnegeri. Still, others consider it a regional variant of the parent species, C. cornuta. Anatomy and morphology left The Mona ground iguana is a large-bodied, heavy-headed lizard with strong legs and a vertically flattened tail, which is capable of reaching in length (from snout to tail). A crest of pointed, horned scales extends from the nape of the neck to the tip of the tail. The color is a uniform gray to olive drab, with slight brown or blue colorations. Juveniles differ from adults in that they have gray transverse bands across their bodies.Rivero, J.A. 1978. Los anfibios y reptiles de Puerto Rico. Universidad de Puerto Rico, Editorial Universitaria, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. 152p. 49 plates. These bands last until they are sexually mature at about three years of age. Males possess bony, prominent tubercles on their snouts resembling horns, adipose pads in the form of a helmet on the occipital region of their heads, and large dewlaps. This subspecies, like other species of Cyclura, is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have more prominent dorsal crests, \\"horns\\" and femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. Habitat Mona ground iguanas are diurnal and spend most of the day basking in the sun conserving energy. Mona ground iguanas are endemic to Mona Island, Puerto Rico. They are scattered through the entire island, though the southwest part of the island is only used during the nesting season. They live a considerable portion of their lives underground, and are usually found in talus slopes, caves and sinkhole depressions. The average depth underground that they can be found is . Reproduction Mona ground iguana hatchling Although Mona ground iguanas use the whole island as their habitat, only 1% of the territory, located on the southwest coast, is suitable for nesting because it contains loose sand, and receives direct sunlight. The females bury their eggs in the sand, and the sunlight incubates the eggs. Males reach sexual maturity at a size of in length from snout to vent, usually in their third to fourth year, while females mature one year later at a size of . Nesting season begins in the second week of June. Usually, one female mates with more than one male in the two weeks the mating season lasts. Copulation may last from 15 sec to 2 mins and 15 sec. One month later, nesting begins. Females will dig a tunnel long located one to two feet underground, where they deposit from five to 19 eggs, with 12 being the average. They will guard their nests for several days, but provide no parental care for the hatchlings, which hatch three months later. Hatchlings measure, on average, and weigh and grow at a rate of per year. Diet Mona ground iguanas, like most Cyclura ssp. are primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, berries, and fruits from different plant species. A study in 2000 by Dr Allison Alberts of the San Diego Zoo revealed that seeds passing through the digestive tracts of Cycluras germinate more rapidly than those that do not. These seeds in the fruits consumed by Cyclura have an adaptive advantage, by sprouting before the end of very short rainy seasons. The Mona ground iguana is also an important means of distributing these seeds to new areas (particularly since females migrate to nesting sites) and, as the largest native herbivores of their ecosystems, they are essential for maintaining the balance between climate and vegetation. Their diets are very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds, and fungi; individual animals do appear to be opportunistic carnivores. Fewer than a dozen animal species and 71 plant species are found in the Mona ground iguanas' diets.Wiewandt, T.A. 1977. Ecology, behavior, and management of the Mona Island ground iguana Cyclura stejnegeri. Ph.D. Thesis. Cornell University. 330p. Mona ground iguanas eat the caterpillar of sphingid moths. These larvae feed on poisonous plants and are aposematically colored and avoided by other predators. Endangered status Population numbers are estimated at 1,500 with lower densities than similar iguana-inhabited islands in the West Indies. Immature iguanas are scarce and represent only 5-10% of the population, revealing that the population is aging and in decline. =Reasons for decline= Feral pigs pose the most serious threat as they root up iguana nests, and like most Cyclura species, the Mona ground iguana nests communally and at high density. Introduced goats and pigs are a major competitor for food and overbrowsing by goats also leads to loss of protective cover from birds of prey such as the osprey and predation of juveniles by feral cats. =Recovery efforts= A headstarting program was put into place by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, with cooperation from the IUCN Iguana Specialist Group, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Toledo Zoo, and the University of Puerto Rico in 1999, to aid in the recovery of the Mona ground iguana. From within the safety of this program, the iguanas are reared until they are large enough to survive in the wild, and predators, such as pigs and feral cats, are no longer a threat. The facility also carries out health screening prior to the release of specimens. This health screening has been used to provide baselines of the normal physiologic values of the species, identifying potential future problems due to parasites, diseases, etc. which might threaten the population.

When it closed, the magazine had most recently been published four times a year (for many years, Transworld Snowboarding published 10 issues per year). The magazine featured articles on the sport, culture and lifestyle of modern snowboarding. History Transworld Snowboarding was first published in 1987 and was distributed internationally. Kevin Kinnear was the founding editor and Guy Motil was the first photo editor. From the launch of the magazine, the Transworld owners and editorial staff were instrumental in petitioning ski resorts to allow snowboarding. During the late 1990s, a visit by \\"The Chameleon,\\" an undercover splitboarder who would reassemble his snowboard at the top of the lift and ride down, was the editorial staff's instrument of choice for calling attention to the last ski resort holdouts including Alta, Park City, Aspen Mountain, Keystone, and Taos.http://snowboarding.transworld.net/photos/the-chameleon-rides-again/ The Chameleon Rides Again!

Lloyd for finding evenly spaced sets of points in subsets of Euclidean spaces and partitions of these subsets into well-shaped and uniformly sized convex cells. Like the closely related k-means clustering algorithm, it repeatedly finds the centroid of each set in the partition and then re-partitions the input according to which of these centroids is closest. In this setting, the mean operation is an integral over a region of space, and the nearest centroid operation results in Voronoi diagrams. Although the algorithm may be applied most directly to the Euclidean plane, similar algorithms may also be applied to higher-dimensional spaces or to spaces with other non-Euclidean metrics. Lloyd's algorithm can be used to construct close approximations to centroidal Voronoi tessellations of the input, which can be used for quantization, dithering, and stippling. Other applications of Lloyd's algorithm include smoothing of triangle meshes in the finite element method. Algorithm description Lloyd's algorithm starts by an initial placement of some number k of point sites in the input domain. In mesh-smoothing applications, these would be the vertices of the mesh to be smoothed; in other applications they may be placed at random or by intersecting a uniform triangular mesh of the appropriate size with the input domain. It then repeatedly executes the following relaxation step: * The Voronoi diagram of the k sites is computed. * Each cell of the Voronoi diagram is integrated, and the centroid is computed. * Each site is then moved to the centroid of its Voronoi cell. Integration and centroid computation Because Voronoi diagram construction algorithms can be highly non-trivial, especially for inputs of dimension higher than two, the steps of calculating this diagram and finding the exact centroids of its cells may be replaced by an approximation. =Approximation= A common simplification is to employ a suitable discretization of space like a fine pixel-grid, e.g. the texture buffer in graphics hardware. Cells are materialized as pixels, labeled with their corresponding site-ID. A cell's new center is approximated by averaging the positions of all pixels assigned with the same label. Alternatively, Monte Carlo methods may be used, in which random sample points are generated according to some fixed underlying probability distribution, assigned to the closest site, and averaged to approximate the centroid for each site. =Exact computation= Although embedding in other spaces is also possible, this elaboration assumes Euclidean space using the L2 norm and discusses the two most relevant scenarios, which are two, and respectively three dimensions. Since a Voronoi cell is of convex shape and always encloses its site, there exist trivial decompositions into easy integratable simplices: * In two dimensions, the edges of the polygonal cell are connected with its site, creating an umbrella-shaped set of triangles. * In three dimensions, the cell is enclosed by several planar polygons which have to be triangulated first:  Compute a center for the polygon face, e.g. the average of all its vertices.  Connecting the vertices of a polygon face with its center gives a planar umbrella-shaped triangulation.  Trivially, a set of tetrahedra is obtained by connecting triangles of the cell's hull with the cell's site. Integration of a cell and computation of its centroid (center of mass) is now given as a weighted combination of its simplices' centroids (in the following called \\\\mathbf{c}_i). * Two dimensions:  For a triangle the centroid can be easily computed, e.g. using cartesian coordinates.  Weighting computes as simplex- to-cell area ratios. * Three dimensions:  The centroid of a tetrahedron is found as the intersection of three bisector planes and can be expressed as a matrix-vector product.  Weighting computes as simplex-to-cell volume ratios. For a 2D cell with triangular simplices and an accumulated area A_C = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i (where a_i is the area of a triangle simplex), the new cell centroid computes as: : C = \\\\frac{1}{A_C}\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\\\mathbf{c}_i a_i Analogously, for a 3D cell with a volume of V_C = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n v_i (where v_i is the volume of a tetrahedron simplex), the centroid computes as: : C = \\\\frac{1}{V_C}\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\\\mathbf{c}_i v_i Convergence Each time a relaxation step is performed, the points are left in a slightly more even distribution: closely spaced points move farther apart, and widely spaced points move closer together. In one dimension, this algorithm has been shown to converge to a centroidal Voronoi diagram, also named a centroidal Voronoi tessellation. In higher dimensions, some slightly weaker convergence results are known. The algorithm converges slowly or, due to limitations in numerical precision, may not converge. Therefore, real-world applications of Lloyd's algorithm typically stop once the distribution is \\"good enough.\\" One common termination criterion is to stop when the maximum distance moved by any site in an iteration falls below a preset threshold. Convergence can be accelerated by over-relaxing the points, which is done by moving each point ω times the distance to the center of mass, typically using a value slightly less than 2 for ω.Xiao, Xiao. \\"Over-relaxation Lloyd method for computing centroidal Voronoi tessellations.\\" (2010). Applications Lloyd's method was originally used for scalar quantization, but it is clear that the method extends for vector quantization as well. As such, it is extensively used in data compression techniques in information theory. Lloyd's method is used in computer graphics because the resulting distribution has blue noise characteristics (see also Colors of noise), meaning there are few low- frequency components that could be interpreted as artifacts. It is particularly well-suited to picking sample positions for dithering. Lloyd's algorithm is also used to generate dot drawings in the style of stippling. In this application, the centroids can be weighted based on a reference image to produce stipple illustrations matching an input image. In the finite element method, an input domain with a complex geometry is partitioned into elements with simpler shapes; for instance, two-dimensional domains (either subsets of the Euclidean plane or surfaces in three dimensions) are often partitioned into triangles. It is important for the convergence of the finite element methods that these elements be well shaped; in the case of triangles, often elements that are nearly equilateral triangles are preferred. Lloyd's algorithm can be used to smooth a mesh generated by some other algorithm, moving its vertices and changing the connection pattern among its elements in order to produce triangles that are more closely equilateral. These applications typically use a smaller number of iterations of Lloyd's algorithm, stopping it to convergence, in order to preserve other features of the mesh such as differences in element size in different parts of the mesh. In contrast to a different smoothing method, Laplacian smoothing (in which mesh vertices are moved to the average of their neighbors' positions), Lloyd's algorithm can change the topology of the mesh, leading to more nearly equilateral elements as well as avoiding the problems with tangling that can arise with Laplacian smoothing. However, Laplacian smoothing can be applied more generally to meshes with non-triangular elements. Different distances Lloyd's algorithm is usually used in a Euclidean space. The Euclidean distance plays two roles in the algorithm: it is used to define the Voronoi cells, but it also corresponds to the choice of the centroid as the representative point of each cell, since the centroid is the point that minimizes the average squared Euclidean distance to the points in its cell. Alternative distances, and alternative central points than the centroid, may be used instead. For example, used a variant of the Manhattan metric (with locally varying orientations) to find a tiling of an image by approximately square tiles whose orientation aligns with features of an image, which he used to simulate the construction of tiled mosaics. In this application, despite varying the metric, Hausner continued to use centroids as the representative points of their Voronoi cells. However, for metrics that differ more significantly from Euclidean, it may be appropriate to choose the minimizer of average squared distance as the representative point, in place of the centroid.

Stephens was born and raised in the Pittsburgh area city of Uniontown, Pennsylvania and is best known for his career as a college football quarterback at the University of Minnesota, where he became one of the first African-American quarterbacks in major college football and the first African American to be named an All-American at quarterback. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. College career Stephens was the first black man to play quarterback at the University of Minnesota and remains the only quarterback to take the Gophers to the Rose Bowl (1961 and 1962).

Professional career Stephens was a second-round NFL draft choice of the Cleveland Browns and the fifth overall selection in the AFL draft by the New York Titans. Both teams said that they wouldn’t use him as a quarterback and he never played a down in either league. The Canadian Football League (CFL) welcomed him as a quarterback, as the Montreal Alouettes offered a reported $25,000 signing bonus and a three-year contract at $30,000 per year.Canadian Football League Illustrated, V.1 No.8, p. 31. After playing for the Alouettes in 1962 and 1963, he was claimed on waivers by the Toronto Argonauts in 1964. Upon leaving the CFL, Stephens tried out as a walk-on with the Minnesota Vikings. In his CFL career, he threw 22 touchdowns with 38 interceptions on 2,823 yards, while rushing for 487 yards on 88 carries and 8 touchdowns. He also caught 12 passes for 192 yards and a touchdown. He was also used as an occasional kicker, making 12 out of 19 extra points and 4 out of 8 field goals, with three punts for a 20-yard average.https://www.cflapedia.com/Players/s/stephens_sandy.htm On September 20, 1964, he was involved in a near fatal accident.\\"SANDY STEPHENS CRITICAL AFTER AUTO ACCIDENT\\".

It was one of at least five union stations in Kentucky, amongst others located in Lexington, Covington, Paducah and Owensboro. It was one of three stations serving Louisville, the others being Central Station and Southern Railway Station. It superseded previous, smaller, railroad depots located in Louisville, most notably one located at Tenth and Maple in 1868-1869, and another L&N; station built in 1858. The station was formally opened on September 7, 1891 by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. There was a claim made at the time that it was the largest railroad station in the Southern United States, covering forty acres (16 ha).Kleber, John E. Encyclopedia of Louisville. (University Press of Kentucky). pg.897 The other major station in Louisville was Central Station, serving the Baltimore and Ohio, the Illinois Central and other railroads. Construction Construction of the station began in 1880, but completion was delayed until 1889 due to rising costs totaling at $310,656.47. Local contractors constructed all but the clock tower. Architect F. W. Mowbray was specifically hired for the project, which was to reflect the Richardsonian Romanesque style of architecture. Its exterior was made of limestone ashlar, mostly from Bowling Green, Kentucky, although that from Bedford, Indiana was used for its trim. The roof was made of a slate covering protecting iron and heavy wood. Architectural features include a clock tower, smaller towers, turrets, a facade of considerable size, and barreled vaulting.Kleber, pg.897, 898. The interior was no less impressive. The atrium, dining, and ladies' retiring rooms on the first floor were quite spacious. A wrought iron balcony overlooked the atrium. Soft lighting of the facility came from rose-colored windows on both sides of the atrium. The walls were made of marble from Georgia, as well as oak and southern pine. Ceramic tiles covered the floor.Kleber, pg.898. History Union Station provided the entrance to Louisville for many visitors, with its height being the 1920s, when it served 58 trains a day. As a Union Station, it served not only the L&N; railroad, but also the Monon Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Louisville, Henderson, & St. Louis, the latter eventually merging with the L&N.; Many of those traveling to the Kentucky Derby would use the Union Station as their first place of celebration, with twenty special trains coming to the facility, and Pullman cars allowing overnight accommodations, a trend that continued until the mid-1960s. Three separate United States presidents arrived in Louisville by Union Station. The lobby was once graced by a performance by Sarah Bernhardt.Kleber, pg.898 Aerial view of the Louisville passenger and freight terminals showing Union Station in the first half of the 20th century. On July 17, 1905, a fire occurred in the facility. The structure was unusable until it reopened the following December. A temporary structure was used in its place during the restoration. The rose-colored windows were replaced due to the fire with an 84-paneled stained glass skylight that became a feature of the barrel-vaulting tower. The Ohio River flood of 1937 also saw the structure close for twelve days. Amtrak used the facility regularly from May 1971 until October 1976, when it began running the Floridian in conjunction with the Auto-Train from a suburban station near Louisville International Airport. From December 4, 2001 to July 4, 2003, a track on the west side of the parking lot served Amtrak's Kentucky Cardinal, which ran to Chicago via Indianapolis. However, this effort to return intercity rail to Louisville failed. This was primarily because the Indianapolis-Louisville leg ran along jointed rail that limited its speed to 30 mph, slower than automobile traffic along Interstate 65. L&N; would eventually sell Union Station to TARC, which spent two million dollars from 1979 to 1980 to restore it. Since then it has served as administration offices for TARC. In October 2010, TARC announced plans to use a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to restore all 278 windows at the 120-year-old Union Station, including 40 made of stained glass. Union Station will also get a new geothermal-energy system. Combined with the window restoration, TARC estimates its energy savings will be $58,000 per year.Every Union Station window will be restored =Major named trains served at the station= Until the 1950s and 1960s the station served several prominent trains. *Chicago, Indianapolis, and Louisville Railway (Monon Railroad): Thoroughbred, - Chicago, Illinois - Louisville *Louisville & Nashville: Azalean, New York, New York - New Orleans, Louisiana, with western branch to Memphis, Tennessee Flamingo, (for a period in the 1940s) - Cincinnati, Ohio - Jacksonville, Florida Florida Arrow (winter train, pooled with the Pennsylvania Railroad and others), Chicago-Miami (and Sarasota and St. Petersburg) Humming Bird, Cincinnati, Ohio - New Orleans Pan-American, New York, New York - New Orleans South Wind, Chicago - Miami, Florida unnamed routes to St. Louis via Evansville *Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR): Kentuckian, Chicago - Louisville Union, Chicago - Louisville branch (diverting from Chicago-Cincinnati branch at Logansport, Indiana) Connecting PRR trains to Indianapolis for St. Louis, Missouri - New York City trains: American, Metropolitan, Penn Texas and St. Louisan Connecting PRR train to Fort Wayne for: Northern Arrow (Mackinaw City, Michigan - Cincinnati) See also *List of attractions and events in the Louisville metropolitan area *Union Station (Owensboro) *Humming Bird (passenger train) *Pan-American (passenger train) *South Wind (passenger train) *Floridian (Amtrak) References External links *TARC History and Union Station *TARC gets $9 million in federal grants—Business First October 28, 2010 Category:19th-century buildings and structures in Louisville, Kentucky Louisville Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1891 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Louisville, Kentucky Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Louisville, Kentucky Louisville Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky Category:Clock towers in the United States Category:Towers in Kentucky Louisville Louisville Louisville ","title":"Union Station (Louisville)"},{"id":"2607924","text":"Charles Dallan Maxvill (born February 18, 1939) is a former shortstop, coach and general manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). During his career, Maxvill played, coached, or was an executive for four World Series winners and seven league champions. Early life A native of the St. Louis suburb of Granite City, Illinois, Maxvill played baseball in high school, then attended Washington University where he earned a degree in electrical engineering. He signed his first professional baseball contract in 1960 with the hometown St. Louis Cardinals. Playing career Maxvill appeared in 1,423 regular-season games for the Cardinals (1962–72), Oakland Athletics (1972–73; 1974–75) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1973–74). He batted and threw right-handed. A smooth fielder but notoriously weak hitter, Maxvill set a number of dubious hitting records in his career. He batted .217 with just six home runs in 3,989 plate appearances over his 14-year major league career. Due to the position he played – and the effectiveness with which he fielded – he was also the beneficiary of the convention that shortstops generally do not need to hit as well as other positions for their skills to be considered assets as major league players. Maxvill's best season with the bat was 1968 with the Cardinals. He set career highs in batting average (.253), on-base percentage (.329), and slugging percentage (.298). He also received his only Most Valuable Player award votes (finishing in twentieth place) and won his only Gold Glove. Ironically, as the rest of baseball's pitching became more dominant and hitting trended downward that year, Maxvill's hitting trended upward. In the \\"Year of the Pitcher,\\" he benefited in part from not having to bat against teammate Bob Gibson, who set the modern-day record for earned run average at 1.12, or the rest of the Cardinals' pitching staff, which led the major leagues in earned run average at 2.49. Although comfortably above the hitting prowess of the legendary Casey Wise, Maxvill holds the National League record for fewest hits for a batter playing in at least 150 games. He had 80 hits in 1970 in 399 at-bats in 152 games, just barely over the Mendoza line at .201. (The Sporting News Baseball Record, 2007, p. 19) Cardinals fans of that era often said that when pitching Gibson took his turn, Gibson should bat ahead of Maxvill in the lineup, since he was the better hitter. Gibson's career average was 11 points lower than Maxvill's, but he was much more productive at the plate. Gibson had 24 career home runs in 2,000 fewer at bats. He also had 144 runs batted in compared with Maxvill's 252, meaning that Gibson had a run batted in about every tenth at bat, whereas Maxvill had one about every 14th turn. Despite Maxvill's relatively poor hitting, he frequented the postseason. Maxill appeared in five World Series - three (1964, 1967 and 1968) with the Cardinals and two (1972 and 1974) with the Athletics. In the 1964 Series, which the Cardinals took from the New York Yankees in seven games, Maxvill caught Bobby Richardson's pop-up for the final out in the seventh game. In the 1968 Series, which the Cardinals lost to the Detroit Tigers in seven games, Maxvill went a record 0-for-22 at the plate. His overall World Series batting record was 7-for-61, a .115 percentage. Both of those figures are record Series lows for a position player. However, Maxvill was impeccable defensively in the postseason, handling 88 chances in four World Series and 14 chances in two league championship series without a miscue. Coaching and executive career After his playing career ended, Maxvill served as a coach with the A's, Cardinals, New York Mets and Atlanta Braves (where he served on Joe Torre's staff). After the 1984 season, he became general manager of the Cardinals, spending a decade as the Cardinals' top baseball executive, and the team won two more National League pennants in 1985 and 1987. The 1987 season was the last time one of Maxvill's teams made the playoffs. The Cardinals finished above .500 in 1989, 1991, 1992, and 1993, but their highest ranking was second place. Longtime owner and president August \\"Gussie\\" Busch died in September 1989 and Anheuser-Busch took over operations of the team. Changes within the top levels in the organization continued to the point that most remnants of the Busch era turned over. The next season, longtime manager Whitey Herzog resigned and Torre was hired in his place. However, the brewery did not appear as invested as Busch in making the Cardinals a winning team and began looking to sell the team. As a result, after new president Mark Lamping was hired in 1994, he sought to make changes to attempt to build a winner. Three weeks after Lamping's hire, he fired Maxvill. The next year, Anheuser-Busch sold the team to an investment group led by Fred Hanser, Drew Baur and William DeWitt, Jr. At this point, Maxvill pursued no further baseball opportunities, citing the desire to spend more time with his family.

It is named the \\"Hummer\\" by locals due to a distinct humming sound it makes while feeding.  Description  The Bahama woodstar is a small hummingbird, growing to be only about in length. These birds weigh around .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . Their backs are green and gold, with olive-buff underparts, and flanks fading into white (males) or cinnamon (females). Wings are brown and their tails appear a blackish-purple.Cory, C. B. (1890). The birds of the Bahama Islands : containing many birds new to the Islands, and a number of undescribed winter plumages of North American birds. Boston, U.S.A.: Estes & Lauriat. Males have a fork-shaped tail while females display a more rounded tail with wider feathers. Males have bright purple iridescent gorgets lined with a white stripe, which dull out as breeding season ends. Females do not have the purple throat or white stripe.Feo, T. J., Musser, J. M., Berv, J., & Clark, C. J. (2015). Divergence in morphology, calls, song, mechanical sounds, and genetics supports species status for the Inaguan hummingbird (Trochilidae: Calliphlox evelynae lyrura , 132(1), 248-264. Both males and females have black, slightly curved bills and black feet. There are wing beats  Distribution  The Bahama woodstar is distributed around the Bahama Archipelago, including the Turks and Caicos Islands and with exception to the Inagua islands.Chesser, R. T., Banks, R. C., Burns, K. J., Cicero, C., Dunn, J. L., Kratter, A. W., . . . Winker, K. (2015). Fifty-sixth Supplement to the American Ornithologists' Union: Check-list of North American Birds. tauk The Auk, 132(3), 748-764. It has also been recorded multiple times in Florida, United States.Fisk, E. J. (1974). Second U. S. Record of a Bahama Woodstar. American Birds, 28(4). In April 2013 a bird was seen for three days at a feeder in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. They are less plentiful on the Grand Bahama, Abaco and Andros Islands that house the Cuban Emerald, an introduced hummingbird which shows aggression towards the Bahama Woodstar.Harbour, R. (2011). Bahama Woodstars & Cuban Emeralds: The hummingbirds of Abaco. Retrieved October 12, 2015, from  Habitat  Bahama Woodstars are found in many different habitats such as gardens, Scrubland, both secondary growth and dry lowland, the edges of Tropical Evergreen Forests and Pine Forests. They tend not to migrate very far from these habitats being a year-round species. Although they may inhabit the same area as other Woodstars, they are not very social and will often become aggressive towards other birds.Bahama Woodstar. (2005). The Bahamas National Trust. Retrieved October 12, 2015  Taxonomy  Hummingbirds are the second most abundant group of avian families, having approximately 338 different recognized species. Due to its recent divergence between lineages, the many clades within this group are constantly under close scrutiny and rearrangement.McGuire, J. A., Witt, C. C., Remsen, J. V., Jr., Corl, A., Rabosky, D. L., Altshuler, D. L., & Dudley, R. (2014). Molecular phylogenetics and the diversification of hummingbirds. Current Biology, 24(8), 910-916. The Bahama Woodstar in particular belongs to the \\"Bee Clade\\", the youngest and most extensively diversifying clade. A characteristic of this clade is the fact that males use their tails to make sounds.Clark, C. J. (2010). The Evolution of Tail Shape in Hummingbirds. tauk The Auk, 127(1), 44-56. Relationships between species and genera of this clade are still being re- evaluated.McGuire, J. A., Witt, C. C., Altshuler, D. L., Remsen, J. V., Zamudio, K., & Sullivan, J. (2007). Phylogenetic Systematics and Biogeography of Hummingbirds: Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood Analyses of Partitioned Data and Selection of an Appropriate Partitioning Strategy. Systematic Biology, 56(5), 837-856. The Bahama Woodstar is one of the species which has been recently re-evaluated, having used to contain two subspecies of woodstars: Nesophlox evelynae evelynae and Nesophlox \\"evelynae\\" lyura also known as the Inagua woodstar. However, hummingbird species can be separated depending on morphological differences in tail shape and presence or absence of iridescent feathers, both known to play a role in sexual selection. For this reason, the Inagua woodstar, formerly considered a subspecies, is now a species in itself (Nesophlox lyrura) . It has a fully iridescent crown and a more lyre-shaped tail than the Bahama woodstar.  Behaviour  = Diet = Bahama Woodstars mainly suck up nectar from local plants . On the Abaco Islands, one of these plants include Ernodea serratifolia. They visit the flowers during the mornings and evenings. Lacerations can be seen in the tubular corollas of the flowers, where the beaks of these birds and other hummingbird species took the nectar.Negron-Ortiz, V. (1996). Reproductive biology of Ernodea (Rubiaceae- Spermacoceae) in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico. Opera Botanica, 7, 403-412. They may also feed on insects. = Vocalizations = The Bahama woodstar has three typical vocalizations: \\"chips\\", scolding and song. During flight and feeding Bahama woodstars will make a one syllable \\"chip\\" sound. The length of this call may vary, from a simple \\"chip\\" to a longer, repeated sequence of \\"chips\\". Other simple calls such as \\"spurts\\" from courting or fighting males, and \\"cheep\\" sounds from younglings have rarely been recorded. Scolding was recorded during agonistic behaviour such as fighting and chasing. Scolding is a two syllable call, where the second syllable may be vocalized once or repeated multiple times after the first syllable. The frequency of both \\"chips\\" and scolding range from 7 to 9 Hz, compared to 1.5 to 3 Hz in Calliphlox lyrura. Songs are vocalized when resting on a branch or by males courting females. This song is high-pitched and lasts around 30 seconds, compared to the shorter song of Calliphlox lyrura. The call of the Bahama Woodstar somewhat resembles that of the North American Anna's hummingbird.Dunn, J. L., & Alder, J. (2008). Field guide to the birds of eastern North America: National Geographic. = Reproduction =  Courtship Displays  During the breeding season, males court females using two courting displays: shuttle displays, broken into shuttle segments which are periods of side to side flight and aerial dives. Shuttle displays include three forms: initial, typical and alternate. * The initial shuttle is characterized by a brief shuttle segment followed by a period of hovering over the on-looking female. * Typical shuttle displays are characterized by rapid segments of repeated lateral flight around the female while constantly looking at her. Males will frequently change direction and angle of their flight. In addition, during the middle of the segment they will snap their tail to the side a few times. At the end of each segment, they beat their wings at a high intensity making a buzzing sound known as a wing trill . The male will slowly decrease his distance from the female until he is only centimeters away from her. * Alternate shuttle displays include shuttle segments and song while hovering over the female. Males sometimes only use one type of display, or they may use typical combined with alternate. Aerial dives have seldomly been recorded, but are always demonstrated after shuttle displays. Males will zigzag up to heights of 20 m and then abruptly dive back down towards their perch, near the female. Breeding season is mainly in April, but Bahama Woodstars may also breed year-round.  Nesting  Nesting is done in a small cup made of soft materials such as cotton and down, woven together with lichen and various plant materials such as twigs and bark The height of these nests varies, some recorded as low as 2 feet and as high as 12 feet. Females lay 2 white oval shaped eggs which incubate for approximately two weeks.

The village's center is located along Snickersville Turnpike (Virginia Route 734), west of the incorporated town of Round Hill. The village borders Virginia's fox hunting country and is within of the Appalachian Trail and the Bears Den and Raven Rocks formations in the Blue Ridge. Originally named Snickersville, the village renamed itself to Bluemont to help it attract visitors from Washington, D.C. when a predecessor of the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad extended its line westward from Round Hill in 1900. As of 2010, the Bluemont postal area had a population of 2,834. At ,Elevation of Bluemont from CalTopo Retrieved January 19, 2020. it is the highest community in Loudoun County. Every fall it is home to the Bluemont Fair. A nearby landmark is Mount Weather, an operations and training facility above ground for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and is rumored to contain an underground facility designed to house or replace the American government in the case of nuclear warfare.  History  The settlement of the area that is now Bluemont began in the 1770s when a connection was made between the old Winchester Pike, which led from Loudoun to Winchester via Keyes' (Vestals) Gap, and the Colchester Road which ran from the port of Colchester to Winchester via Snickers Gap (named after Edward Snickers, who operated a ferry across the nearby Shenandoah River). The new connector road greatly reduced the distance one had to travel to get to Winchester from points east along the Winchester Pike and quickly became widely used. At the intersection of these two roads (present day Clayton Hall Road and Snickersville Turnpike) a small community began to develop, centered around the home of William Clayton, Clayton Hall, and the dependencies he built for his farm at the gap. The settlement was christened Snickers' Gap in 1807 when a post office was established there. Seventeen years later, in 1826, the town was incorporated by the General Assembly as Snickersville, though it would take another six years for the post office there to change its name. The completion of the Leesburg and Snickers Gap Turnpike in 1832 (present day Virginia State Highway 7) brought new prosperity and prestige to the community, and the last major growth it would see for the next half-century. Despite the strategic importance of Snickers' Gap during the Civil War, Snickersville saw surprisingly little action save the coming and going of the armies through the gap. The only major action in the town was one of eight small partisan skirmishes in the area which took place May 23, 1864, when 14 Confederates surprised and routed 22 Federals resting in the town. In 1875, the Washington and Ohio Railroad, which began in Alexandria, was extended to Round Hill. The lure of the Blue Ridge some four miles west prompted a livery service to run from Snickersville to Round Hill to pick up travelers and take to them to one of the several hotels that began to spring up in and about the town. In 1900, the success of the resorts in the vicinity of Snickersville, including Jules DeMonet's Blue Ridge Inn at Bear's Den, prompted the Southern Railway (which had acquired the Washington & Ohio's route) to extend its tracks to the town, which became the final western terminus of line. The extension permitted the steam railroad's passengers to travel to the base of the Blue Ridge from a terminal in Washington, D.C. To promote the resort nature of the town, the railroad petitioned the United States Postal Service to change the name of the town to Bluemont. The Postal Service acquiesced to this request on September 7, 1900. The zenith of the town came in 1908, when its population peaked at 200. In 1912, interurban electric trolleys of the new Washington and Old Dominion Railway began to serve Bluemont on the Southern Railway's former steam route. However, with the advent of the automobile, the town's rail-based tourism began to decline. In 1939, deteriorating conditions on a trestle immediately east of Round Hill, combined with a lack of rail traffic, led to the abandonment of the line between Purcellville and Bluemont. By the 1940s Bluemont had become a sleepy community of about 140 inhabitants. Still its scenic location continued to be a lure, especially artists and musicians, including artist Clyde Beck, who with Evelyn Johnson, founded the Bluemont Citizens Association and the annual Bluemont Fair in 1968. Around the same time the commune of Skyfields was established by local musicians Howard Bass and Peter Dunning. From the commune and the musicians it attracted was founded the Bluemont Concert Series in the 1970s.

This exposes one's own units to many small risks but allows for the eventual destruction of an entire enemy force.Defeat in Detail: A Strategy to Defeating Larger Armies cites Edward J Erickson, but calls this a strategy rather than a tactic. Use In military strategy and tactics, a recurring theme is that units are strengthened by proximity to supporting units. Nearby units can fire on an attacker's flank, lend indirect fire support such as artillery or maneuver to counterattack. Defeat in detail is the tactic of exploiting failures of an enemy force to co-ordinate and support the various smaller units that make up the force. An overwhelming attack on one defending subunit minimizes casualties on the attacking side and can be repeated a number of times against the defending subunits until all are eliminated. An attacker can successfully conduct the tactic of defeat in detail by exploiting the absolute weaknesses or the comparative disadvantages in the deployment or structure of defending troops, or advantages, such as maneuvering speed, that the defender cannot match. In an asymmetric support structure, A can support B but unit B cannot support unit A. For example, during World War I, when horse cavalry were still in use to some extent, aircraft could support cavalry, but cavalry had little or no ability to support aircraft. Thus, if a unit is equally suited for use against cavalry and against aircraft, using it to eliminate enemy aircraft would have benefits that would last well into future engagements against enemy cavalry units weaker for their lack of support, but using it against enemy cavalry, leaving the enemy aircraft intact for subsequent engagements, would bring benefits during that engagement alone. =Weaknesses of defenders= * Dug-in units that are spread out over so wide a distance that the maximum effective range of their weapons is significantly shorter than the distance between units, which prevents those units from supporting the flanks of neighboring units. * Defending units on opposite sides of physical barriers such as hills, forests or rivers (but see the \\"reverse slope defence\\", now rendered obsolete by manned and unmanned aircraft, for a historically-attested deliberate tactic). * Defending units whose artillery support is too far to the rear and so cannot effectively engage attackers. * Defending units that have no effective communications with their command structure and so cannot request assistance. =Enabling methods= The following methods can enable the attacker to defeat the enemy in detail: * Attacking one unit faster than other defending units can move to counter-attack. * Attacking faster than the defending intelligence, communications, command or control systems can respond to (exploiting the OODA loop). * Disabling or disrupting systems required for one defending unit to support another (as by attacking communications, command, or control systems with air strikes, artillery attacks, or radio jamming). Examples =Strategic campaigns= * 1796–1797: Napoleon Bonaparte's first campaign in Italy during the French Revolution, in which the French army of 37,000 men defeated 52,000 Piedmontese and Habsburg troops by rapid advances, which prevented the two nations' armies from combining. * 10–15 February 1814: the Six Days' Campaign was a final series of victories by the forces of Napoleon, as the Sixth Coalition armies closed in on Paris.; and * 1862: Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley campaign, in which Jackson defeated three Union commands (a total of 60,000 men) with his own command (of 17,000 men), by fighting each of the enemy columns in turn while the Union commands were separated from each other by impassable terrain or a significant distance. * 1912–1913: The Balkan League's victory over the Ottoman Empire in the First Balkan War. * 1914: The Battle of Tannenberg and the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes, with the Germans exploiting the geography of the Masurian Lakes and the personal antipathy between the Russian commanders to defeat the Russian Second Army and later the Russian First Army. * 1941: Operation Compass, when the British defeated an Italian force more than four times larger in North Africa by exploiting the fact that the Italian defenses could not support each other. =Tactical examples= * The Battle of Gaugamela, in which Alexander the Great used his Companion Cavalry to charge Darius III * Gallic tribes tried and nearly succeeded in defeating Julius Caesar's army in detail at the Battle of the Sabis. * In the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, an army of Germans under Arminius exterminated Legio XVII, Legio XVIII and Legio XIX, Roman legions under Publius Quinctilius Varus. * The Battle of Sluys, a naval battle fought on 24 June 1340 between England and France. * The Battle of Pavia (1525), during the Italian War of 1521-1526 * The Battle of Pratapgarh in which Shivaji defeated the army of Afzal Khan * The Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876), in which George Armstrong Custer essentially orchestrated his own defeat by dividing his regiment in four portions, allowing the Sioux and Cheyenne to annihilate half of the 7th Cavalry * The Battle of Raate Road, in Finland (1940)  See also  * Horatii * Big Wing * Strategy of the central position * Battle of annihilation * Swarming (military) * Lanchester's laws * Battle of Cold Harbor References * Category:Military strategy Category:Military tactics ","title":"Defeat in detail"},{"id":"2607984","text":"The culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is extremely diverse, reflecting the great diversity and different customs which exist in the country. Congolese culture combines the influence of tradition to the region, but also combines influences from abroad which arrived during the era of colonization and has continued to have a strong influence, without destroying the individuality of many tribal' customs. People, language and background A map of the major Bantu languages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Like many African countries, the borders were drawn up by colonial powers, and bore little relation to the actual spread of ethno-linguistic groups. There are 242 languages spoken in the country, with perhaps a similar number of ethnic groups. Broadly speaking, there are four main population groups: * Pygmies, the earliest inhabitants of the Congo, are generally hunter- gatherers. Expert in the ways of the forest, where they have resided for thousands of years, they live by trading meat with their taller farming neighbors in exchange for agricultural products. Increasingly, they are assimilating into non-Pygmy society and adopting the latter's languages and customs. * Bantus arrived in the Congo in several waves from 2000 BC to 500 AD, mainly from the area in what is now southern Nigeria. They are by far the largest group, and the majority live as subsistence-farmers. They are present in almost every part of the country, and their languages make up three of the DRC's five officially recognized languages. Among these are Kikongo, Lingala and Tshiluba. Kikongo is spoken by the Kongo people in the far west of the country, both on the coast and inland, and was promoted by the Belgian colonial administration. Elements of Kikongo have survived amongst the descendants of slaves in the Americas—for instance, the language of the Gullah people of South Carolina contains elements of Kikongo. Lingala, spoken in the capital Kinshasa, is increasingly understood throughout the country, as the lingua franca of trade, spoken along the vast Congo river and its many tributaries. Lingala's status as the language of the national army, as well as its use in the lyrics of popular Congolese music, has encouraged its adoption, and it is now the most prominent language in the country. Tshiluba (also known as Chiluba and Luba-Kasai) is spoken in the southeastern Kasai regions. * Bantus also brought in the fourth of the DRC's official languages, Kingwana — a Congolese dialect of Swahili. Note that the fifth language, French, is the official language of government, a result of Congo's colonial relationship with Belgium. These Swahili-speaking Bantus are related to the other Bantus mentioned above, but tend to differ in their way of life, in that they practice herding as well as farming. They came from the various countries to the east of Congo: Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania, bringing with them many of the ethnic rivalries that have inflamed recent conflicts. * The northeastern part of the country is inhabited by groups who are believed to have originally come from the southern Sudan region. In general, these are cattle herders and include the Tutsi. These migrants also entered Rwanda and Burundi around the same time, often mixing with the settled groups. The above descriptions are by necessity simplified. Many Congolese are multilingual, and the language used depends on the context. For instance, a government official might use French to set a tone of formality and authority with another official, use Lingala when buying goods at a market, and the local language when in his home village. English is also spoken, especially in the east where eastern and southern African influences have spread in the post-Mobutu era. Among the slangs spoken in Congo, Indubil has been noted since around the 1960s, and continues to evolve nowadays. Mixed marriages between ethnic groups are common, particularly in urban areas where many different groups live side by side. Europeans appear in small numbers throughout the country, as missionaries in the countryside, and as businessmen and traders in the cities. Also acting as merchants are small numbers of Lebanese and Pakistanis. More information on the various peoples in Congo can be found in the Early Congolese History article. Religion and belief Branhamist worshippers in Kinshasa The main religions in the DRC are: * Indigenous traditional beliefs: 11.5% * Catholic Christianity: 50% * Protestant Christianity: 20% * Indigenous Christianity: 13.5%, nearly all of whom (13%) are followers of Kimbanguism. * Other Christian denominations: 1% * Islam: 1.5% There are small communities of Jews and Hindus who work in commercial urban areas. Atheism is very rare. =Indigenous traditional beliefs= Though only 11.5 per cent of Congolese exclusively follow indigenous beliefs, these traditional belief systems are often intermingled with forms of Christianity, and are familiar to the majority of Congolese. Throughout the DRC the beliefs take on a number of forms, but they have a number of things in common: * A creator spirit is thought to be sovereign of the spirit world, but this god is rarely the direct cause of events. In many Congolese languages, the name of the creator god derives from the word father or maker. Some groups regard the creator as being omnipresent, whilst others believe the god lives in the sky. For most believers in indigenous religions, contact with the creator god is made via ancestor spirits. A smaller number of groups believe that individuals can have direct contact. *A belief in an essential life-force which animates the body; the force is thought to leave the body upon death and become an ancestor spirit. These spirits continue to be active in the lives of living relatives—by either punishing or rewarding them. In a similar way to saints in the Catholic tradition, some long-dead ancestors (for instance, great hunters or religious leaders) are venerated by people outside their former family. * Nature spirits, worshiped mainly in forested regions, are often the embodiment of particular locations such as whirlpools, springs and mountains. The afterlife is believed to exist underground, especially under lakes, where ghostly replicas of Congolese villages reside. * Diviners, witches, dream interpreters and healers act as conduits for supernatural forces. * Ceremonies and collective prayers—to ancestors, nature spirits and the creator god—are generally performed at particular locations such as sacred trees, grottoes or crossroads. These ceremonies usually take place at a specific time of day. The location and times vary according to the ethnic group. Belief in Witchcraft is common, and sometimes intersects with the more fundamentalist and evangelical versions of Christianity. In recent years, these beliefs have gained adherents in urban areas, whereas before they were mainly confined to the countryside. The increasing beliefs in witches and sorcery have tended to mirror the social decay caused by war and poverty. Many of the street children that roam the Congo's cities have been cast out of their families after being denounced as witches. These homeless 'witch children' often live in cemeteries and only come out at night, and follow occult practices. See BBC News article on Kinshasa's street children. For comparison, see article on beliefs of Miami street children. =Catholic and Protestant Christianity= A Congolese Christian. Christianity has a long history in Congo, dating back to 1484, when the Portuguese arrived and convinced the king and entourage of the Kongo people to convert. In 1506, a Portuguese-supported candidate for kingship, Alfonso I of Kongo won the throne. Alfonso (the Kongo royal family had begun to take on Portuguese names), established relations with the Vatican. More widespread conversion occurred during the Belgian colonial era. Christianity varies in its forms, and is in some ways surprisingly similar to native beliefs. During the colonial period, a European-style Christianity was at first promoted by the authorities. Native Congolese generally attended different churches or services from whites. If they worshiped under the same roof, the native Congolese sat on benches at the back, while the whites sat in chairs at the front. Towards the end of the colonial era, more African elements were incorporated into Christianity, including songs and dances which were formerly condemned as pagan. Eventually, even native fables and myths were appropriated and merged into Congolese Christianity, in a similar process to that which occurred with Christianity in Europe. Recent developments include the increasing popularity of the \\"Gospel of Prosperity\\" – a form of Christianity in which the emphasis is on wealth acquisition and born-again Christianity. Adherents are led to believe that instant wealth and magical prosperity will result from giving tithes to their charismatic preacher. The leaders often draw on the techniques of American televangelists, and the message is appealing to those living in extreme poverty. =Kimbanguism= In the first half of the 20th century, prophetic movements sprang up. Their nature was both anti-colonial and Christian, and led to a rigorous crackdown by the authorities. Simon Kimbangu was the prophet of the largest of these movements. He was born in a village near Kinshasa, raised and educated by a Protestant Christian mission and trained to become a priest. In April 1921, at the age of 39, he reportedly had a religious vision of Jesus Christ, who called on him to reconvert his people and dedicate his life to Christ. Kimbangu chose to try to ignore the vision, and fled to Kinshasa where he abandoned his life as a priest and took to menial work. More visions came, and eventually he heeded the calling and returned to his home village and started to devote his life to Christ. Soon after, he is reported to have healed a sick woman by laying his hands on her. Dozens of apparent miracles were subsequently performed by Kimbangu, and he gained followers from surrounding villages and towns. The official Catholic organizations protested to the authorities, and the Protestant church abandoned him. The economic effects of Kimbangu's ministry were being felt, with thousands of Congolese leaving their work to listen to Kimbangu speak. In June the Belgians arrested him for inciting revolution and civil disobedience. Four months later he was sentenced to death. After an international outcry, Albert I of Belgium commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. He died 30 years later in prison, in 1951. Colonial authorities assumed his movement would wither after his imprisonment and death, but the church continued to flourish underground, and was an effective weapon in the fight against colonialism. In the post-colonial era, its record has been more mixed. Instead of banning the church, Mobutu used a far more effective method of neutralizing it: namely co-opting the church and giving it an official status. Kimbanguism has now spread across the country, and now has branches in nine of the surrounding countries, making it the most popular \\"native\\" form of Christianity in Africa. Followers do not smoke, drink alcohol and abhor violence. Monogamy is practiced. =Religion today= Article 22 of the constitution allows for religious freedom. These rights are generally respected by the government. Religious tension exists in some areas because of the link between prophetic groups and paramilitary organizations. In the turbulent eastern region, where the Second Congo War still simmers, some guerrilla groups have a major religious element, believing for instance that they are able to turn enemy bullets into water by wearing certain fetishes. Cuisine A woman carrying bananas. Only 2.86% of the land is cultivated, and most of this is used for subsistence farming. People gather wild fruit, mushrooms, and honey, as well as hunt and fish. They will often sell these crops at markets or by the roadside. Cattle breeding and the development of large-scale agricultural businesses has been hindered by the recent war and the poor quality of the road system. Congo's farmland is the source of a wide variety of crops. These include maize, rice, cassava (manioc), sweet potato, yam, taro, plantain, tomato, pumpkin and varieties of peas and nuts. These foods are eaten throughout the country, but there are also regional dishes. The most important crops for export are coffee and palm oil. Music Congolese musicians, like Le Grand Kallé or TPOK Jazz with their emblematic lead singer Franco Luambo Makiadi, were extremely influential in pioneering the musical style of \\"African Rumba\\"', a blend of South American and modern African musical styles, more often known as Soukous in the years leading up to the independence of the Belgian Congo. After that, Congolese musicians were supported by the Mobutu regime in Zaire, and many Congolese musicians became very successful on the international market for African popular music. Cinema In the years following independence, the nascent Congolese film industry was held up by many years of war. However, the first Congolese feature film (La Vie est Belle by the celebrated director Mwezé Ngangura) was released in 1987. In recent years, Congolese cinema has reached a wider audience, though the growth of the industry is restricted by the small profits which directors can make (owing to unauthorized distribution) and rarity of credit.

Traditional art of the more than 100 ethnic groups includes masks, wooden or ivory statues, textiles and other woven artifacts. From November 2019, the new National Museum of the DRC will present both traditional material and immaterial cultural heritage, such as music, as well as contemporary art.The largest collection of the cultural heritage of the Congo, however, is presented, stored and studied at the Africa Museum in Belgium. Notable contemporary artists are Chéri Samba and Bodys Isek Kingelez. The best known artists successful inside and outside the country are Lema Kusa (painting), Alfred Liyolo (sculpture), Roger Botembe (painting), Nshole (painting), Henri Kalama Akulez (painting), Mavinga (painting), Freddy Tsimba (sculpture), Claudy Khan (painting). Some are teaching at the Académie de Beaux-Arts de Kinshasa, which is the only fine arts academy on a university level in the country.

Foundation IMRO (United) was founded in 1925 in Vienna after the failure of the May Manifesto by the left wing of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). It was under the leadership of several Bulgarians as Dimitar Vlahov, Pavel Shatev, Georgi Zankov, Rizo Rizov, Vladimir Poptomov, Metodi Shatorov and Hristo Yankov. Its main objective was to free Macedonia within its geographical and economical borders, and to create a new political entity which would become an equal member of the future Balkan Federative Republic. It was accepted as a partner in the Balkan Communist Federation and was sponsored directly by the Comintern,Macedonia and the Macedonians: A History, Andrew Rossos, Hoover Press, 2008, , p. 132. maintaining close links with the Bulgarian communist leader Georgi Dimitrov.

Activities The Resolution of the Comintern publicly acknowledged the existence of the Macedonian nation and Macedonian language, although published as a resolution of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United), was undoubtedly the most significant international acknowledgement of the Macedonian national individuality, which had very favorable consequences for its development and affirmation. The text of this historic document was prepared in the period between December 20, 1933 and January 7, 1934 by the Balkan Secretariat of the Comintern. It was accepted by the Political Secretariat in Moscow on January 11, 1934, and approved by the Executive Committee of the Comintern. It was published for the first time in the April issue of Makedonsko Delo under the title \\"The Situation in Macedonia and the Tasks of IMRO (United)\\". After replying to those who, even within the progressive movement, denied the existence of a separate Macedonian nation, the Resolution, among other things, stated: > \\"...The bourgeoisie of the ruling nations in the three imperialist states > among which Macedonia is partitioned, tries to camouflage its national > oppression, denying the national features of the Macedonian people and the > existence of the Macedonian nation.\\". By 1935, the IMRO (United) organisation in Greece was working closely with the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). Indeed, on 3 July 1935, the KKE newspaper, Rizospastis, reported a statement issued by the IMRO (United) organisation in Edesa (Voden) and signed by G. Slavos: > \\"...We Macedonians also insist on not being called Bulgarians, for we are > neither Bulgarians, nor Serbs, nor Greeks, but Macedonians. We invite all > Macedonians to join the ranks of the IMRO (United), and all of us together > will fight for a free Macedonia...\\" However the members of the IMRO (United) had previously declared themselves as Bulgarians and never managed to get rid of their pro-Bulgarian bias.Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 135.Palmer, S. and R.

He was the acting Governor-General of Bengal from 1785 to 1786. Early life Macpherson was born in 1745 at Sleat in the Isle of Skye, where his father, John Macpherson (1713–1765), was minister. His mother was Janet, daughter of Donald Macleod of Bernera. The father, son of Dugald Macpherson, minister of Duirinish, distinguished himself in classics at Aberdeen University (M.A. 1728, and D.D. 1761), and was minister of Barra in the presbytery of Uist (1734–42), and of Sleat (1742–65). He published Critical Dissertations on the Origin, Antiquities, Language, Government, Manners, and Religion of the Ancient Caledonians, their Posterity, the Picts, and the British and Irish Scots, London, 1768, and paraphrased the Song of Moses in Latin verse in Scots Magazine, vols. i. ix. xi. He upheld the authenticity of the poems assigned to Ossian, and Samuel Johnson declared that his Latin verse did him honour. Martin Macpherson (1743–1812), Dr. Macpherson's elder son, succeeded him at Sleat, and won Dr. Johnson's regard when the doctor visited the highlands. John, the younger son, was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, and at the University of Edinburgh. First journey to India In March 1767 he sailed for India, nominally as purser of an East India ship, commanded by his maternal uncle, Captain Alexander Macleod. Macpherson landed at Madras, where he obtained an introduction to Mohammed Ali, Nawab of the Carnatic. The latter, whose affairs were in great disorder, had borrowed large sums of money at high interest from the East India Company's officials at Madras. Hard pressed by his creditors, he entrusted Macpherson with a secret mission to Britain, with the object of making representations on his behalf to the home government. Macpherson arrived in Britain in November 1768. He had several interviews with the prime minister, Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, who eventually despatched Sir John Lindsay, as king's envoy extraordinary, to effect a settlement of the Nawab's claims. This commission being novel and unwarrantable, the company protested, and Lindsay was recalled. Second journey to India Macpherson returned to India in January 1770 with the position of a writer in the company's service. He remained for six years at Madras occupied with administrative work. He also renewed his acquaintance with the nabob, for whom, as he himself confesses, he occasionally procured loans of money. In 1776 George Pigot, 1st Baron Pigot, the governor of Madras, obtained possession of a letter addressed to the nabob by Macpherson, in which details were given regarding the latter's mission to Britain. The paper contained severe reflections on the company's action, and indicated that Macpherson had engaged in a plot to set the home government against them. He was therefore dismissed the service. He returned to Britain in 1777, having previously furnished himself with fresh despatches to the home government from the nabob. MP for Cricklade 1779-1782 Macpherson remained in England for four years. From April 1779 to May 1782 he sat in the House of Commons for Cricklade, and was one of six members suspected of being in receipt of a salary from the nabob of Arcot in return for pressing the latter's claims on the legislature. Appointment in Calcutta Macpherson had appealed to the court of directors against his dismissal by the Madras council. The former were by no means satisfied with the intrigues indulged in by their servants in the Carnatic, and reinstated him. In January 1781, however, before he could return to Madras, he was appointed by Lord North, whose government he had supported, to the seat on the Supreme Council of Bengal vacated by Richard Barwell. The appointment was severely criticised in public; and in 1782 a committee of the House of Commons declared that Macpherson's past conduct in supporting the pretensions of the nabob had tended to endanger the peace of India. Macpherson offered a regular but unintelligent opposition to the measures of Warren Hastings during the latter years of that governor-general's rule. =Governor-General= In February 1785, as senior member of the council, he became governor-general on Hastings's resignation. Owing to the long and desperate war in which the British had been engaged, he found the finances in great disorder. Pressing demands for assistance were coming from Bombay and Madras, the arrears of pay due to the troops amounted to £2 millions sterling (£0.6 billion sterling in 2009), and the deficit in the revenue of the current year was estimated at £1,300,000 (£390 millions in 2009). =Managing the finances= Macpherson began by using the actual cash in the treasury to pay the troops, who were on the verge of mutiny. All other payments were made in bonds bearing interest at eight per cent. per annum till redeemed. Strenuous reductions were made in the public expenditure, the utmost care was exercised over the collections, and in twelve months' time enough cash had been accumulated to pay off the whole of the new paper debt, besides meeting the ordinary expenses of government. At the close of his administration Macpherson was able to boast that he had reduced expenditure by the large sum of £1,250,000 (£375 millions in 2009) . It must, however, be remembered that during his rule no war took place; and his financial achievements were really due to the suggestions of a subordinate, Jonathan Duncan. Macpherson moreover did nothing to stop the gross corruption indulged in by the company's officials, and Lord Cornwallis, an impartial critic, denounces his government as ‘a system of the dirtiest jobbery’. =Claim from Maharaja Mahdoji Sindia= Shortly after Macpherson's accession to the supreme power, the Mahratta chief, Maharaja Mahdoji Sindia, having obtained possession of Shah Alum, titular emperor of India, demanded from the English a sum of £4,000,000 (£1.2 billion in 2009). as arrears of the tribute promised by them to the emperor in 1765. Macpherson answered by insisting upon an immediate withdrawal and disavowal of the claim, threatening war if it were repeated. To further guard against the ambition of Sindia, he established Charles Malet as English envoy at Poonah, the acknowledged capital of the Mahratta confederacy. In 1786 the Mahrattas declared war against Tipu, sultan of Mysore. Macpherson offered them the assistance of three battalions to be employed in defending the Mahratta territories. The offer remained unaccepted during Macpherson's tenure of office, and was withdrawn by his successor. =Penang= Macpherson presided over the acquisition and founding of Penang, appointing Francis Light as administrator, in June 1786. =Return to Britain= Macpherson was created a baronet on 10 June 1786, and was superseded, much to his dissatisfaction, by Lord Cornwallis in September, after which he returned to Britain. His friends endeavoured to show that the legal term of the governor-generalship was five years, and that Macpherson's removal, save for misconduct, after only twenty months was an injustice. The claim, for which there was no foundation, was disregarded, and Macpherson now endeavoured to obtain from Dundas a promise of the succession to Lord Cornwallis, or at any rate a return to his old place on the Bengal council. This also was refused. Macpherson's sole object in harassing the government with these demands was to obtain some heavy pecuniary compensation, and when his chances of office became quite hopeless, he applied to the court of directors for a pension of £2,000 (£0.6 million in 2009). a year. After some delay he obtained a sum of 15,301 Pounds 7 Shilling, payable in three instalments between 1 March 1789 and 1 March 1790. In June 1809 he obtained in addition a pension of £1,000 (£0.3 million in 2009) a year in return for assigning to the company a claim of £10,000 (£3 millions in 2009)on the nabob of Arcot. MP for Cricklade 1788 In 1788 Macpherson was again elected to the House of Commons for Cricklade, but was unseated for bribery on the petition of his opponent, Samuel Petrie, and cast in penalties to the amount of 3,000 pounds. He now joined the whig opposition, and was till 1802 on intimate terms with the Prince of Wales. Visits to Florence and Vienna In 1789 he visited Florence, where his advice was asked by the Grand Duke Leopold on financial and administrative matters. When Leopold became emperor in 1790 he visited him at Vienna. Macpherson's tall figure, handsome face, and courtly manners made him a great favourite in society; and his wide knowledge and linguistic talents won him the respect of scholars. MP for Horsham 1796-1802 He obtained a seat for Horsham in September 1796, and continued in the house till June 1802. Dispute with Whitshed Keene In 1806, in a discussion on Indian affairs, Whitshed Keene, the member for Montgomery, availed himself of the opportunity to censure his relations with the nabob of Arcot. Macpherson replied to the implied charges in an Open Letter to Whitshed Keene, Esq., M.P., dated 31 May 1806. He stated that in 1777 he had, through his intimacy with the nabob, obtained knowledge of secret overtures made to that prince by France, the exposure of which had been of great service to the British government. He also added that his claims on the nabob were still unpaid. Death Macpherson died unmarried, at Brompton Grove, on 12 January 1821, when the baronetcy became extinct.

The commercial success of this album ultimately kick-started their career and re-affirmed their reputation as a fresh and vibrant young face in South African music. The commercial success of this album launched their career through their reputation as a vibrant South African band. The exposure from this album resulted in an invitation for the band to perform at both the Harare International Festival of the Arts and the Robben Island African Festival. This album was remixed by Keith Farquharson, remastered by Chris Athens and re-released in 2008.Jika Jika, 2008, album liner notes =Nomvula (2004–2006)= In 2004, Freshlyground participated in the opening of Parliament of South Africa by perfoganised as a celebration of ten years of democracy in South Africa.

July also marked a break from the recording studio for the band, who had been working hard on their then unreleased album Nomvula. The band took this time to perform at the Villa Celimontana Festival in Rome, Italy. Finally, in late 2004, Freshlyground released their very successful album, Nomvula. Although the uptake of the album was initially slow, it eventually went on to achieve double platinum status locally. Initial success was largely due to the catchy, feel-good, lyrics of Doo Be Doo, which enjoyed significant play on local radio, it was also covered in Indonesian by singer Gita Gutawa. Follow-up hits included I'd like and the signature track Nomvula, the former achieving unprecedented success on radio charts such as the 5FM Top 40, where it remained at No. 1 for several weeks. =Ma'Cheri (2007)= The album Ma'Cheri was released on 3 September 2007.

He was the writer of Bānat Suʿād (Su'ād Has Departed), a qasida in praise of Muhammad.Michael A. Sells and M. J. Sells, Bānat Suʿād: translation and introduction, Journal of Arabic Literature Vol. 21, No. 2 (Sep., 1990), pp. 140-154 This was the first na'at in Arabic.Tarikhul adab AL arabi by Ahmad Hasan zaiyaat, . This is the original Al-Burda. He recited this poem in front of Muhammad after embracing Islam. Muhammad was so moved that he removed his mantle and wrapped it over him. This original Burdah is not as famous as the one composed by Imam al-Busiri even though Muhammad had physically wrapped his mantle over Ka'b, not in a dream like in the case of Imam al-Busiri. Life Zuhayr started composing poetry as a child; his father - a renowned poet himself - prohibited him and suggested not to compose poetry till the strengthening of his ideas and speech. Nevertheless, he continued to compose poetry. At last one day his father Zuhayr took a hard test of him, when he succeeded in that hard test his father allowed him to compose poetry and Ka'b become a famous poet of that time.Arbi adab ki tarikh by Muhammad Kazem When Islam came, Ka'b and his brother Bujayr went out to Muḥammad but in the way Ka'b's intention changed and he turned back. Bujayr went to Muḥammad and accepted Islam . When Ka'b found out about his brother accepting Islam, he composed a satire of his brother and Muḥammad. After that Muḥammad declared punishment for Ka'b. Then his brother Bujayr advised him to seek pardon of Muḥammad. At first, he did not listen to his brother and started seeking help of others in the matter. But later he reached Muḥammad through Abu Bakr and accepted Islam. It was then that he recited the first na'at Bānat Suʿād. In his book, Muhammad, Prophet of God, Peterson reveals a very touching portrait of the conversion of this initially rather sceptic man. Poetry Ka'b found environment of poetry at his home. Because of this he started composing poetry at a young age and become a famous poet. Critic Khalful Ahmar says that if Zuhayr had not done the long poetry through which he became famous, he wouldn't have considered him a greater poet than his son. Another critic says that if he had not composed his poetry using hard language then he could be a great poet as his father before him.

They were elected to the London Assembly in June 2004 as United Kingdom Independence Party representatives, but in February 2005 announced the formation of the Veritas group at the Assembly. With the disintegration of Veritas after its poor showing in the 2005 general election, Hockney and Hulme-Cross formed One London, with Hockney as leader. One London became a registered party in November 2005 and de-registered in November 2008. 2008 London Mayoral and Assembly election In February 2008 the party announced that Hockney would be its candidate in the 2008 Mayoral election, promising to reverse the erstwhile mayor's anti-motorist policies and to halve the GLA portion of the council tax over the four-year mayoral term. On 27 March 2008 Hockney pulled out of the race to become the mayor of London. He cited a lack of media opportunities for the candidates representing smaller parties as the reason but confirmed that the party would still contest the Assembly election. The party received just 0.14% of the London-wide list vote, coming last in overall votes and losing both its Assembly seats. Ideology and policies Although UK withdrawal from the European Union was a central policy objective, One London concentrated its efforts on the democratic deficit within London governance and the discrepancy between levels of taxation and public spending in London compared to the rest of the United Kingdom. It also called for the abolition of the London congestion charge and claimed to be the first party to have predicted that the cost of the 2012 London Olympics would exceed £10 billion. Controversy The naming of the party as 'One London' caused some comment as the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, had just started a public campaign under that name as an attempt to build closer relations between ethnic communities following the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

It derives from the Galloway cattle of the Galloway region of south-western Scotland, and was established as a separate breed in 1921. It is adapted to living on the poor upland pastures and windswept moorlands of the region. The exact origin of the breed is unclear, although the white belt for which they are named – and which distinguishes the breed from the native black Galloway cattle – is often surmised to be the result of cross-breeding with the similarly-coloured Dutch Lakenvelder breed. Belted Galloways are primarily raised for their quality marbled beef, although they are sometimes milked or kept for ornament.  History  The Belted Galloway derives from the traditional Galloway cattle of the Galloway region of south-western Scotland, which in turn form part of a broader group of traditional Scottish cattle including the Aberdeen Angus and Highland breeds. Galloways are most often black, but other colours occur; the white-belted or white-middled Galloway was one of them. The origin of the white belt is unknown; it is thought to have resulted from some cross-breeding with Dutch Lakenvelder cattle in the seventeenth century. From 1852, both Aberdeen Angus and Galloways could be registered in a herd-book for polled cattle. A separate Galloway herd-book was established in 1878. In 1921 a group of breeders set up the Dun and Belted Galloway Association, which – as the name suggests – registered both belted and dun-coloured Galloways; its first herd-book was published in 1922. In 1951 registration of dun cattle was discontinued, and the society changed its name to the Belted Galloway Society. In the twentieth century, Belted Galloways were exported to many countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Holland, New Zealand and the United States. Breed societies were started in New Zealand in 1948, in the US in 1951, and in Australia in 1975. Like other breeds, the Belted Galloway suffered heavily during the epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease in the British Isles in 2001, and a substantial part of the total population was lost. By 2007 numbers had recovered to the point where it could be removed from the endangered native breed watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust; in the same year the global breed population was listed by the FAO as \\"not at risk\\". In 2012 there were approximately 3500 registered breeding cows in the United Kingdom. It is listed by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy as a \\"recovering\\" breed, which means there are more than 2,500 annual registrations in the United States and a global population greater than 10,000, but they were once on the \\"watch\\" list. About 18,390 cattle were registered in the US in 2015.  Characteristics  Several Belted Galloways Galloway cattle are naturally polled (without horns). The most visible characteristics are its long hair coat and the broad white belt that completely encircles its body. Its coarse outer coat helps shed the rain, and its soft undercoat provides insulation and waterproofing, enabling the breed to spend winter outside. Black Belteds are the most prominent, but Dun and Red Belteds are also recognised by breed societies, the latter being comparatively rare and sought after. A female Belted Galloway cannot be registered in the Herd Book if it has white above the dewclaw other than the belt, but can be registered in the Appendix. A bull can only be registered in the Herd Book if it has no other white than the belt. The dun colour is caused by a mutation in the PMEL gene, the same mutation that causes dun and silver dun in Highland cattle. The black and red coat colours are caused by the same alleles of the MC1R gene, ED for black and e/e for red, as in most other breeds of cattle. Bulls weigh from , with the average being around . Cows weigh from , with the average being around . Calves generally weigh around at birth. Belted Galloways are generally of a quiet temperament, but still maintain a maternal instinct and protect calves against perceived threats. They are well-suited for rough grazing land and will use coarse grasses other breeds would shun. They are able to maintain a good condition on less than ideal pasture, and produce high-quality beef on grass alone. They have on occasions attacked people.  Use  The Belted Galloway is reared mainly for beef; it may also be used for vegetation management. An old strain is listed as the \\"Original Belted Galloway Cattle\\" in the Ark of Taste of the Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity.

It is located about 30 kilometers from Kuching. The district population (year 2014 census) was 157,792. Kota Samarahan is the main education hub for Sarawak State and officially known as \\"Town of Knowledge\\". The District Officer of this city is Datuk Patinggi Puan Hajah Affidatul. On January 11, 2017, Chief Minister Adenan Satem died in Sarawak Heart Hospital in this city. History Kota Samarahan was once known as Muara Tuang which was at that time a small village in the area. The village was linked to Kuching by a road only in early 1970s. Before that, the only means of transport to the village was via the nearby river. Development in the small village accelerated with the construction of a 25-kilometre road linking Kota Samarahan to Kuching. Geography Kota Samarahan is almost a suburb of the greater metropolitan area of Kuching, in the Kuching Division. It is located about 30 km south east of Kuching. The lands in Samarahan are mostly non-hilly, flat and low-lying. Most of the soils are peat soils which are ideal for coconut, oil palm and pineapples plantation. Most of the development in the Samarahan Division is concentrated in Kota Samarahan. Economy Agriculture is still the main economic activity in Kota Samarahan but light industries were slowly moving in. The service sector, especially in education related-sector, is becoming increasingly significant in Samarahan. Commercial centres were blooming to cater for the increasing population. Shopping Malls *The Summer Mall @ Servay Hypermarket *Aiman Mall (H&L; Supermarket and Grand Supermart is anchor tenants) Education Kota Samarahan has a concentration of universities and educational facilities, thus forming it into a main educational hub in Sarawak. Institutions of higher learning in the area includes Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Universiti Teknologi MARA Kota Samarahan Campus (2 campuses), Institute of Teacher Education (Tun Abdul Razak Campus, Kota Samarahan Industrial Training Institute (ILPKS) and AAA Zenith Services (English language service provider). Medical Facilities The Heart Centre, Sarawak General Hospital (SGH Heart Centre) is located in Kota Samarahan. The RM400 million centre, formerly known as Sarawak International Medical Centre (SIMC), was assigned professional cardiac specialists, along with the latest modern technology. In addition, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) has proposed to build a training hospital for its Medicine and Health Sciences Faculty under the 10th Malaysia Plan. Shopping The Summer Shopping Mall - Located at Kota Samarahan, is a 3-storey shopping mall with an underground car park. The adjacent Summer Lagoon Water Theme Park is on schedule to be open later in this year. Its main tenants are Servay Hypermarket, Parkwell Departmental Store and Lotus Five Star, the region largest Lotus Five Star Cineplex with 12 comfortable hall consist of 9 elegant Cinema hall, two 3D Movie Hall and one classy theatre room. Transportation Prior to 1990, the shortest means of access into Samarahan from Kuching was via a ferry at Sungai Kuap other than direct road access from Jalan Datuk Muhamad Musa which takes longer. The construction of a bridge has further shortened the road distance from between Kuching-Kota Samarahan to 11 kilometers. This new road, officially known as Kuching-Kota Samarahan Expressway, links Kota Samarahan with the major industrial areas of Pending, Demak Laut and Sama Jaya. This new road is currently undergoing some expansion in anticipation of increased traffic between Kuching-Samarahan due to the increasing population in Samarahan.

He was commissioned in the Signal Officers Reserve Corps on August 15, and he received training as an aerial observer at Post Field, Oklahoma, before sailing for France in March 1918. After additional training in aerial gunnery and artillery fire control, Second Lieutenant Keesler was posted to the 24th Aero Squadron in the Verdun sector of the Western Front on August 26, 1918. While performing a reconnaissance mission in the late afternoon of October 8, 1918, Keesler and his pilot, 1LT Harold W. Riley, were attacked by four enemy fighters. Keesler returned fire and shot down the leader, but Riley lost control of their badly damaged plane. Keesler continued to fend off the attackers with machine gun fire even as it fell. He was wounded six times in the chest and abdomen before the plane crash-landed. Lieutenant Keesler received an additional wound when the enemy fighters strafed them on the ground. Captured by German ground troops, the two airmen were unable to receive immediate medical attention, and Keesler died the following day. On January 16, 1919, Lt. Riley recommended him for a decoration, citing his continued resistance all the way to the ground, despite his wounds.

The flowers resemble narcissus flowers in having a prominent central cup or corona, which is sometimes tinged with green.Planchon, Jules Émile. 1853. Catalogue des Plantes Exotiques 8: 3.Meerow, A. W. 1989. Systematics of the Amazon lilies, Eucharis and Caliphruria (Amaryllidaceae). Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 76(1): 136–220 Cultivation and uses Eucharis amazonica and the hybrid Eucharis × grandiflora are the best-known and most generally cultivated species. It is propagated by removing the offsets, which may be done in spring, potting them singly in 15 cm pots. It requires good loamy soil, with enough sand to keep the compost open, and should have a good supply of water. A temperature of 18° to 20 °C during the night, and rising to 25 °C in the day. During summer growth is to be encouraged by repotting, but the plants should afterwards be slightly rested by removal to a night temperature of about 15 °C, water being withheld for a time, though they must not be left dry for too long, the plant being an evergreen. By the turn of the year they may again have more heat and more water, and this will probably induce them to flower. With a stock of the smaller plants to start them in succession, it is possible to have plants in flower all the year round.

He is an ardent enthusiast for traditional English dance music (with a background in English church music), including Morris and other rituals and ceremonies, but his repertoire also includes much French folk music and traditional Québécois material. He has worked for many years in a duo with button accordion/melodeon player Andy Cutting: Wood & Cutting are one of the most influential acts on the English folk music scene. Q Magazine gave their \\"Live at Sidmouth\\" album four stars and put the duo \\"at the forefront of the latest wave of British music acts\\". One of his first recordings was playing bass and percussion on \\"Jack's Alive\\" (1980) the first album by the Oysterband (at that time called the Oyster Ceilidh Band). Wood is also a member of Wood, Wilson & Carthy, with Roger Wilson and Martin Carthy. Wood & Cutting, together with piano accordionist Karen Tweed and guitarist Ian Carr, make up the Two Duos Quartet, who have made one album \\"Half as happy as we\\". With John Dipper on fiddle and Robert Harbron on concertinas, he is part of the English Acoustic Collective. This is also the name of an organisation which Wood set up in 1999 to link the many threads of his teaching activities, including summer schools based at Ruskin Mill near Nailsworth, Gloucestershire. Other projects include \\"Listening to the River\\" (a concert project which interweaves recordings of dialect and oral history from the area around the River Medway with live music) and \\"Glassblower\\", described as \\"an industrial ballet\\". At the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2006, the Best Original Song category was won by Wood and storyteller Hugh Lupton for \\"One in a Million\\", a modern retelling of a widespread traditional tale in which a lost ring is rediscovered in the stomach of a fish. He was also nominated in three other categories: Best Album (for The Lark Descending), Best Traditional Track (\\"Lord Bateman\\"), and Folk Singer of the Year. In 2009, the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards recognised Wood as 'Folk Singer of the Year', and Trespasser was also recognised as Album of the Year. In March 2009, Wood took part in the Darwin Song Project, a multi-artist songwriting retreat organised by the Shrewsbury Folk Festival to create songs that had a \\"resonance and relevance\\" to Darwin.

Its standard form, broadly speaking, asserts that the gravitational energy of an isolated system is nonnegative, and can only be zero when the system has no gravitating objects. Although these statements are often thought of as being primarily physical in nature, they can be formalized as mathematical theorems which can be proven using techniques of differential geometry, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory. Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau, in 1979 and 1981, were the first to give proofs of the positive mass theorem. Edward Witten, in 1982, gave the outlines of an alternative proof, which were later filled in rigorously by mathematicians. Witten and Yau were awarded the Fields medal in mathematics in part for their work on this topic. An imprecise formulation of the Schoen-Yau / Witten positive energy theorem states the following: The meaning of these terms is discussed below. There are alternative and non-equivalent formulations for different notions of energy-momentum and for different classes of initial data sets. Not all of these formulations have been rigorously proven, and it is currently an open problem whether the above formulation holds for initial data sets of arbitrary dimension. Overview The original proof of the theorem for ADM mass was provided by Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau in 1979 using variational methods and minimal surfaces. Edward Witten gave another proof in 1981 based on the use of spinors, inspired by positive energy theorems in the context of supergravity. An extension of the theorem for the Bondi mass was given by Ludvigsen and James Vickers, Gary Horowitz and Malcolm Perry, and Schoen and Yau. Gary Gibbons, Stephen Hawking, Horowitz and Perry proved extensions of the theorem to asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes and to Einstein–Maxwell theory. The mass of an asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime is non-negative and only equal to zero for anti-de Sitter spacetime. In Einstein–Maxwell theory, for a spacetime with electric charge Q and magnetic charge P, the mass of the spacetime satisfies (in Gaussian units) :M \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{Q^2 + P^2}, with equality for the Majumdar–Papapetrou extremal black hole solutions. Initial data sets An initial data set consists of a Riemannian manifold and a symmetric 2-tensor field on . One says that an initial data set : * is time-symmetric if is zero * is maximal if In local coordinates, this says * satisfies the dominant energy condition if :: R^g-k_g^2+(\\\\operatorname{tr}_gk)^2\\\\geq 2\\\\big\\\\operatorname{div}^gk-d(\\\\operatorname{tr}_gk)\\\\big_g, :where denotes the scalar curvature of .In local coordinates, this says or, in the usual \\"raised and lowered index\\" notation, this says Note that a time-symmetric initial data set satisfies the dominant energy condition if and only if the scalar curvature of is nonnegative. One says that a Lorentzian manifold is a development of an initial data set if there is a (necessarily spacelike) hypersurface embedding of into , together with a continuous unit normal vector field, such that the induced metric is and the second fundamental form with respect to the given unit normal is . This definition is motivated from Lorentzian geometry. Given a Lorentzian manifold of dimension and a spacelike immersion from a connected -dimensional manifold into which has a trivial normal bundle, one may consider the induced Riemannian metric as well as the second fundamental form of with respect to either of the two choices of continuous unit normal vector field along . The triple is an initial data set. According to the Gauss-Codazzi equations, one has :\\\\begin{align} \\\\overline{G}( u, u)&=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Big(R^g-k_g^2+(\\\\operatorname{tr}^gk)^2\\\\Big) \\\\overline{G}( u,\\\\cdot)&=d(\\\\operatorname{tr}^gk)-\\\\operatorname{div}^gk. \\\\end{align} where denotes the Einstein tensor of and denotes the continuous unit normal vector field along used to define . So the dominant energy condition as given above is, in this Lorentzian context, identical to the assertion that , when viewed as a vector field along , is timelike or null and is oriented in the same direction as .It is typical to assume to be time- oriented and for to be then specifically defined as the future-pointing unit normal vector field along ; in this case the dominant energy condition as given above for an initial data set arising from a spacelike immersion into is automatically true if the dominant energy condition in its usual spacetime form is assumed.  The ends of asymptotically flat initial data sets In the literature there are several different notions of \\"asymptotically flat\\" which are not mutually equivalent. Usually it is defined in terms of weighted Hölder spaces or weighted Sobolev spaces. However, there are some features which are common to virtually all approaches. One considers an initial data set which may or may not have a boundary; let denote its dimension. One requires that there is a compact subset of such that each connected component of the complement is diffeomorphic to the complement of a closed ball in Euclidean space . Such connected components are called the ends of .  Formal statements  = Schoen and Yau (1979) = Let be a time-symmetric initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. Suppose that is an oriented three-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold-with-boundary, and that each boundary component has positive mean curvature. Suppose that it has one end, and it is asymptotically Schwarzschild in the following sense: Schoen and Yau's theorem asserts that must be nonnegative. If, in addition, the functions x^5\\\\partial_p\\\\partial_q\\\\partial_rh_{ij}(x), x^5\\\\partial_p\\\\partial_q\\\\partial_r\\\\partial_sh_{ij}(x), and x^5\\\\partial_p\\\\partial_q\\\\partial_r\\\\partial_s\\\\partial_th_{ij}(x) are bounded for any i,j,p,q,r,s,t, then must be positive unless the boundary of is empty and is isometric to with its standard Riemannian metric. Note that the conditions on are asserting that , together with some of its derivatives, are small when is large. Since is measuring the defect between in the coordinates and the standard representation of the slice of the Schwarzschild metric, these conditions are a quantification of the term \\"asymptotically Schwarzschild\\". This can be interpreted in a purely mathematical sense as a strong form of \\"asymptotically flat\\", where the coefficient of the part of the expansion of the metric is declared to be a constant multiple of the Euclidean metric, as opposed to a general symmetric 2-tensor. Note also that Schoen and Yau's theorem, as stated above, is actually (despite appearances) a strong form of the \\"multiple ends\\" case. If is a complete Riemannian manifold with multiple ends, then the above result applies to any single end, provided that there is a positive mean curvature sphere in every other end. This is guaranteed, for instance, if each end is asymptotically flat in the above sense; one can choose a large coordinate sphere as a boundary, and remove the corresponding remainder of each end until one has a Riemannian manifold-with- boundary with a single end. = Schoen and Yau (1981) = Let be an initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. Suppose that is an oriented three-dimensional smooth complete Riemannian manifold (without boundary); suppose that it has finitely many ends, each of which is asymptotically flat in the following sense. Suppose that K\\\\subset M is an open precompact subset such that M\\\\smallsetminus K has finitely many connected components M_1,\\\\ldots,M_n, and for each i=1,\\\\ldots,n there is a diffeomorphism \\\\Phi_i:\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\\\smallsetminus B_1(0)\\\\to M_i such that the symmetric 2-tensor h_{ij}=(\\\\Phi^\\\\ast g)_{ij}-\\\\delta_{ij} satisfies the following conditions: * xh_{ij}(x), x^2\\\\partial_ph_{ij}(x), and x^3\\\\partial_p\\\\partial_qh_{ij}(x) are bounded for all i,j,p,q. Also suppose that * x^4 R^{\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast g} and x^5 \\\\partial_pR^{\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast g} are bounded for any p * x^2(\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast k)_{ij}(x), x^3\\\\partial_p(\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast k)_{ij}(x), and x^4\\\\partial_p\\\\partial_q (\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast k)_{ij}(x) for any p,q,i,j * x^3 ((\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast k)_{11}(x)+(\\\\Phi^\\\\ast k)_{22}(x)+(\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast k)_{33}(x)) is bounded. The conclusion is that the ADM energy of each M_1,\\\\ldots,M_n, defined as : \\\\text{E}(M_i)=\\\\frac{1}{16\\\\pi}\\\\lim_{r\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_{x=r}\\\\sum_{p=1}^3\\\\sum_{q=1}^3\\\\big(\\\\partial_q(\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast g)_{pq}-\\\\partial_p(\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast g)_{qq}\\\\big)\\\\frac{x^p}{x}\\\\,d\\\\mathcal{H}^2(x), is nonnegative. Furthermore, supposing in addition that * x^4\\\\partial_p\\\\partial_q\\\\partial_r h_{ij}(x) and x^4\\\\partial_p\\\\partial_r\\\\partial_s\\\\partial_t h_{ij}(x) are bounded for any i,j,p,q,r,s, the assumption that \\\\text{E}(M_i)=0 for some i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\} implies that , that is diffeomorphic to , and that Minkowski space is a development of the initial data set . = Witten (1981) = Let (M,g) be an oriented three-dimensional smooth complete Riemannian manifold (without boundary). Let k be a smooth symmetric 2-tensor on M such that : R^g-k_g^2+(\\\\operatorname{tr}_gk)^2\\\\geq 2\\\\big\\\\operatorname{div}^gk-d(\\\\operatorname{tr}_gk)\\\\big_g^2. Suppose that K\\\\subset M is an open precompact subset such that M\\\\smallsetminus K has finitely many connected components M_1,\\\\ldots,M_n, and for each \\\\alpha=1,\\\\ldots,n there is a diffeomorphism \\\\Phi_\\\\alpha:\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\\\smallsetminus B_1(0)\\\\to M_i such that the symmetric 2-tensor h_{ij}=(\\\\Phi^\\\\ast_\\\\alpha g)_{ij}-\\\\delta_{ij} satisfies the following conditions: * xh_{ij}(x), x^2\\\\partial_ph_{ij}(x), and x^3\\\\partial_p\\\\partial_qh_{ij}(x) are bounded for all i,j,p,q. * x^2(\\\\Phi_\\\\alpha^\\\\ast k)_{ij}(x) and x^3\\\\partial_p(\\\\Phi_\\\\alpha^\\\\ast k)_{ij}(x), are bounded for all i,j,p. For each \\\\alpha=1,\\\\ldots,n, define the ADM energy and linear momentum by : \\\\text{E}(M_\\\\alpha)=\\\\frac{1}{16\\\\pi}\\\\lim_{r\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_{x=r}\\\\sum_{p=1}^3\\\\sum_{q=1}^3\\\\big(\\\\partial_q(\\\\Phi_\\\\alpha^\\\\ast g)_{pq}-\\\\partial_p(\\\\Phi_\\\\alpha^\\\\ast g)_{qq}\\\\big)\\\\frac{x^p}{x}\\\\,d\\\\mathcal{H}^2(x), : \\\\text{P}(M_\\\\alpha)_p=\\\\frac{1}{8\\\\pi}\\\\lim_{r\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_{x=r}\\\\sum_{q=1}^3\\\\big((\\\\Phi_\\\\alpha^\\\\ast k)_{pq}-\\\\big((\\\\Phi_\\\\alpha^\\\\ast k)_{11}+(\\\\Phi_\\\\alpha^\\\\ast k)_{22}+(\\\\Phi_\\\\alpha^\\\\ast k)_{33}\\\\big)\\\\delta_{pq}\\\\big)\\\\frac{x^q}{x}\\\\,d\\\\mathcal{H}^2(x). For each \\\\alpha=1,\\\\ldots,n, consider this as a vector (\\\\text{P}(M_\\\\alpha)_1,\\\\text{P}(M_\\\\alpha)_2,\\\\text{P}(M_\\\\alpha)_3,\\\\text{E}(M_\\\\alpha)) in Minkowski space. Witten's conclusion is that for each \\\\alpha it is necessarily a future-pointing non-spacelike vector. If this vector is zero for any \\\\alpha, then n=1, M is diffeomorphic to \\\\mathbb{R}^3, and the maximal globally hyperbolic development of the initial data set (M,g,k) has zero curvature. = Extensions and remarks = According to the above statements, Witten's conclusion is stronger than Schoen and Yau's. However, a third paper by Schoen and Yau shows that their 1981 result implies Witten's, retaining only the extra assumption that x^4 R^{\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast g} and x^5 \\\\partial_pR^{\\\\Phi_i^\\\\ast g} are bounded for any p. It also must be noted that Schoen and Yau's 1981 result relies on their 1979 result, which is proved by contradiction; their extension of their 1981 result is also by contradiction. By contrast, Witten's proof is logically direct, exhibiting the ADM energy directly as a nonnegative quantity. Furthermore, Witten's proof in the case \\\\operatorname{tr}_gk=0 can be extended without much effort to higher- dimensional manifolds, under the topological condition that the manifold admits a spin structure. Schoen and Yau's 1979 result and proof can be extended to the case of any dimension less than eight. More recently, Witten's result, using Schoen and Yau (1981)'s methods, has been extended to the same context. In summary: following Schoen and Yau's methods, the positive energy theorem has been proven in dimension less than eight, while following Witten, it has been proven in any dimension but with a restriction to the setting of spin manifolds. As of April 2017, Schoen and Yau have released a preprint which proves the general higher-dimensional case in the special case \\\\operatorname{tr}_gk=0, without any restriction on dimension or topology. However, it has not yet (as of May 2020) appeared in an academic journal.

Externally, such a machine maintains the same appearance to the user, appearing to function properly. Internally, the machine slowly weakens over time. Eventually, unable to withstand the stress, it eventually breaks down. Compared to graceful degradation, the operational quality does not decrease at all, but the breakdown may be just as sudden.http://www.assetinsights.net/Glossary/G_Elegant_Degradation.html This term's meaning varies depending on context and field, and may not be strictly considered exclusive to engineering. For instance, this is used as a mechanism in the food industry as applied in the degradation of lignin, cellulose, pentosan, and polymers, among others. The concept is also used to extract chemicals such as the elegant degradation of Paederus fuscipes to obtain pederin and hemiacetal pseuodopederin. In this process degradation is induced by heat.

The Tallis Scholars is a British professional early music vocal ensemble normally consisting of two singers per part, with a core group of ten singers. They specialise in performing a cappella sacred vocal music. History The group was formed in 1973 by Peter Phillips, who in 1972-1975 was an organ scholar at St John's College, Oxford and studied music with David Wulstan and Denis Arnold. Phillips invited the members of chapel choirs from Oxford and Cambridge to form an amateur Renaissance vocal music ensemble, which turned professional after ten years of concert-giving. From the first performance in the Church of St. Mary Magdalen, Oxford on November 3, 1973, Phillips aimed to produce a distinctive sound, influenced by choirs he admired, in particular the renowned Clerkes of Oxenford, directed by David Wulstan.Phillips, Peter. What We Really Do: The Tallis Scholars. London: Musical Times, 2003, p.143.Milsom, John. A Tallis Scholars' retrospective. Early Music, Volume 32, Number 3, August 2004, p. 466-468. Since winning a Gramophone Award in 1987, the Tallis Scholars have been recognised as one of the world's leading ensembles in Renaissance polyphony.Libbey, Theodore. NPR Listener's Encyclopedia of Classical Music. New York: Workman Pub, 2006. Concerts The Tallis Scholars singers tour widely, performing some 70 concerts a year, in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. In April 1994, they sang Allegri's Miserere mei, Deus in the newly restored Sistine Chapel in Vatican, and performed in February 1994 in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome to commemorate Palestrina's 400th anniversary. In 1999, they toured China, giving two concerts in Beijing. In 1998, the Tallis Scholars marked the ensemble's 25th anniversary with a performance in London's National Gallery. At the millennium, they performed in New York City with Paul McCartney. During the 2013-2014 40th-anniversary concert series, the group announced a world tour including the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The Tallis Scholars started the tour with a concert in St Paul's Cathedral in London for 2000 people. Recordings Since March 1980, the Tallis Scholars have recorded on their own label, Gimell Records, established by Peter Phillips and Steve Smith.Wilson, Nick. Art of Re-Enchantment:Making Early Music in the Modern Age. New York: Oxford University Press, 2013. The label was named after the compositional technique gymel. In accordance with Phillips, Soon, there was a critical consensus that, \\"the Tallis Scholar's recordings are of reliably high quality\\".Sherman, Bernard D. Inside Early Music: Conversations with Performers. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 131. Between 1981 and 2006, the group recorded 40 critically acclaimed discs. The recordings covered a repertoire from over 150 years of music history (approximately the years 1450–1600), with some excursions into later repertoire. In 2010, Gimell released its 50th recording, Victoria's Lamentations of Jeremiah. Other notable releases included Gramophone magazine's Record of the Year Award winning disc of Josquin's Missa Pange lingua and Missa La sol fa re mi. In 2011, the ensemble's recording of Allegri's Miserere mei, Deus in Merton College, Oxford in 1980 was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the \\"50 Greatest Recordings of All Time\\". In 2013, the recording of John Taverner's Missa Gloria tibi Trinitas became the number one in the UK Specialist Classical Chart. Members According to Phillips, during the 1982-1983 concert season, the group formed its core that was more or less consistent for the next 25 years. Some singers left the Tallis Scholars to develop their successful solo careers; these included Michael Chance, Mark Padmore, James Gilchrist, John Mark Ainsley, and Jeremy White, who became a principal bass at The Royal Opera, Covent Garden.The Tallis Scholars’ and Gimell Records’ 30th Anniversary: Peter Phillips and Steve Smith in conversation with John Quinn.

Accomplishments The Tallis Scholars ensemble contributed to the wider and greater recognition of choral works of Tallis, Palestrina, Byrd, Tye, and de Victoria, among the other European Renaissance sacred and secular composers, while performing over 1800 concerts around the world and releasing 50 discs. The singers have paved the way for many younger groups such as The Sixteen, The Clerks, The Cardinall's Musick, The Binchois Consort, Trinity Baroque, the Gabrieli Consort, and Octarium.Knighton, Tess, and David Fallows. Companion to Medieval and Renaissance Music. New York: Schirmer Books, 1992, p. 34. Founded in 1999, the Boston-based early-music a cappella ensemble Blue Heron is viewed by some critics as a direct influence of the Tallis Scholars on the American early-music scene.Keogh, Tom. It’s choral early-music season in Seattle. The Seattle Times, December 9, 2013. In 2000, the group established the Tallis Scholars Summer Schools, a program providing amateur singers and promising young professionals the opportunity to be coached by Phillips and other members of the ensemble in their specialist repertoire. The program now includes three courses which take place in Oakham in the United Kingdom, Seattle in the United States, and Sydney in Australia. Various members of the group have scholarly interests in addition to their activities as professional musicians. Phillips has published a scholarly text English Sacred Music 1549–1649.Phillips, Peter. English Sacred Music, 1549-1649. Oxford: Gimell, 1991. Sally Dunkley, Francis Steele, and Deborah Roberts are all active as music editors and publishers with interests spanning the Renaissance and early Baroque music. Andrew Gant is also organist at the Chapel Royal. The Tallis Scholars have also performed and recorded Russian Orthodox repertoire, including music by Sergei Rachmaninoff and Igor Stravinsky, and contemporary music, including works by Norbert Moret, Ivan Moody, Arvo Pärt, John Tavener and Eric Whitacre. Accolades and awards In 2013, the New York Times described the Tallis Scholars as the \\"superb a cappella ensemble founded and conducted by Peter Phillips\\".Shweitzer, Vivien. Exploring Spirituality, and Ending on a Prayer: Tallis Scholars Feature Taverner Works at White Light Concert. The New York Times, November 18, 2013. During their 40 years of concert performances, the group collected a number of recognitions. In 1987, the Gramophone magazine awarded The Tallis Scholars its Record of the Year, and in 1989 the French magazine Diapason added its Diapason d'Or de l'Année award. In 1991 and 2004, the Gramophone magazine gave The Tallis Scholars its Early Music Award. In 2012, the singers again received the Diapason d'Or de l'Année award, and in 2013 they were elected by a popular vote to the Gramophone's Hall of Fame.

Based upon parallax measurements, it is about from the Sun. The three components are designated Zeta Sagittarii A (officially named Ascella , the traditional name for the entire system) and B, themselves forming a binary pair, and a smaller companion star, C. Nomenclature ζ Sagittarii (Latinised to Zeta Sagittarii) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as ζ Sagittarii A, B and C derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It bore the traditional name Ascella, from a Late Latin word meaning armpit. In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Thalath al Sadirah, which was translated into Latin as Tertia τού al Sadirah, meaning third returning ostrich. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Ascella for the component Zeta Sagittarii A on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

Family  Saltykov was born in Russia in the village of Nikolskoye, southwest to the Lake Nero, the son of Semyon/Semjon Andreievich Saltykov (10 April 1672 - 1 October 1742), a landowner of an ancient Boyar family which rivalled the Romanovs in nobility and was descended from a sister of the first Romanov Tsar, and wife Fekla Jakowlevna Wolynskaya. He had a younger brother, Count Vladimir Semyonovich Saltykov (6 August 1705 - 5 January 1751). He was a distant cousin of Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov, first lover of Catherine the Great, and was also related to Praskovia Fyodorovna Saltykova.  Life  However, the year of his birth is uncertain. It is estimated as between 1697 and 1700, as in 1714 he was sent by Peter the Great to France to master the science of navigation. He remained there for much of the twenty years that followed. In 1729, Saltykov bought the estate of Marfino, and in 1731 he married Princess Praskovia Yuriyevna Trubetskaya (1704 - 1767), a daughter of Prince Yuri Yuriyevich Troubetzkoy by his first wife Princess Yelena Grigoriyevna Cherkasskaya, and on 19 January 1732 or 1733 his father was created a Count. In 1759, during the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian army and would soon win a victory at Palzig (Battle of Kay) and Kunersdorf. In 1763, Saltykov became commander-in-chief of Moscow and was put in charge of the Moscow Senate Office.Московская сенатская контора During Saltykov's time in office, he established a number of new post offices, restored Golovinsky and Kolomensky Palaces, and a number of city gates.

In April 1764, Saltykov reported to Saint Petersburg on the opening of the Moscow Orphanage. With the purpose of providing Muscovites with food, Saltykov banned the removal of imported bread from the city and arranged for wholesale purchases of bread from landowners. He also secured regular wine deliveries to Moscow, the need for which had been estimated at 575,000 vedros. Saltykov was also fighting against gambling. In 1765, he took part in burning of books \\"harmful to the society\\" at the order of Empress Catherine II. During the plague outbreak in 1771, which caused mass departure of landowners, city officials, and rich merchants from Moscow, Pyotr Saltykov asked Catherine the Great for permission to leave the city. Without waiting for her reply, he left for his Marfino estate on the outskirts of Moscow. After a plague riot had broken out in Moscow on 16 September, Saltykov returned to the city.

His research mainly concerns general relativity, supergravity and string theory. Biography Perry attended King Edward's School, Birmingham before reading physics at St John's College, Oxford. He was a graduate student at King's College, Cambridge, under the supervision of Stephen Hawking. He obtained his doctorate in 1978 with a thesis on the quantum mechanics of black holes. In these early years, he worked on several very influential papers on Euclidean quantum gravity and black hole radiation with Gary Gibbons and Hawking. After his graduate studies, he worked in Princeton, New Jersey from 1978 to 1986. With his student Rob Myers, he found the Myers-Perry metric, which describes the higher-dimensional generalization of the Kerr metric. He also started working on supergravity, string theory and Kaluza–Klein theory. In his final years in Princeton he worked with Curtis Callan, Emil Martinec and Daniel Friedan to calculate the low-energy effective action for string theory. In 1986, he returned to Cambridge, being elected a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he has worked ever since. In 2010, his attention has focused on generalised geometry and the doubled formalism for string theory, extending these ideas to M-theory in collaboration with David Berman. In 2016, he returned to black hole physics with Hawking and Strominger and began a series of highly influential works attempting to solve long standing problems in black hole thermodynamics.

It tells the story of a poor house painter named Mr. Popper and his family, who live in the small town of Stillwater in the 1930s. The Poppers unexpectedly come into possession of a penguin, Captain Cook. The Poppers then receive a female penguin from the zoo, who mates with Captain Cook to have 10 baby penguins. Before long, something must be done lest the penguins eat the Poppers out of house and home. Plot Mr. Popper is a house painter of modest means, living with his wife and two children (Bill and Janie) in the small town of Stillwater, Minnesota. He has a happy life, however, he is also a restless dreamer, spending his time reading of famous explorers in faraway places. One day, the Popper family tunes in to a radio broadcast by an Admiral exploring polar regions. Mr. Popper had previously sent the Admiral fan mail, and the Admiral promises Mr. Popper a surprise. The surprise turns out to be a penguin, which comes in a large box. Mr. Popper names the penguin \\"Captain Cook\\" after the famous James Cook. Mr. Popper cleans out the icebox so that the penguin can sleep inside. As time goes by, the Poppers find that Captain Cook is growing larger, but his health is failing. Mr. Popper writes to the curator of a large aquarium, asking for help. The curator replies that the aquarium has a female penguin who unfortunately, is also experiencing the same symptoms, and he suggests that perhaps the penguins are simply lonely. Soon after, the Poppers receive their second penguin in the mail. Mr. Popper names the second penguin Greta and the pair of penguins are revitalized by each other's presence. As both birds cannot fit into the icebox together, Mr. Popper opens the window to let in the cold winter air, creating a snow-covered habitat. As this solution will not work in springtime, Mr. Popper has the main things moved upstairs and a freezing plant installed in the basement for the birds. This makes for happy penguins, but strains the family budget. As time passes, Greta lays eggs. She continues laying a new egg every three days until the total reaches ten. As penguins do not normally lay so many eggs, Mr. Popper attributes this to the change in climate the birds have experienced. When the eggs hatch, the Popper family now has twelve penguins to feed, and the contractor is looking for payment on the household changes. Mr. Popper decides to raise money by training the twelve penguins and turning them into a circus act. The act debuts at the local theater, and soon the \\"Popper's Performing Penguins\\" are featured throughout the country. But in the theater in New York City, the penguins cause trouble; what's worse, they've accidentally shown up at the wrong theater. The manager of the wrong theater is extremely angry and has Mr. Popper arrested, along with the penguins. Admiral Drake, having arrived to see Popper's Performing Penguins for himself, posts bail for Mr. Popper. After speaking with the Admiral, Mr. Popper decides that show business is no life for a penguin. Drake lets all of the twelve penguins go with him on his expedition to the North Pole, where they will be released experimentally into the Arctic. The Poppers are sad to see the penguins go, especially Mr. Popper himself — that is, until Admiral Drake invites Mr. Popper to accompany him on the trip. The Poppers wave goodbye as Mr. Popper and his penguins sail away towards the North Pole and Mr. Popper promises to be back in a year or two.

It was one of the inaugural 1958 Lewis Carroll Shelf Award books. Film adaptation A 20th Century Fox film based loosely on the book was released on June 17, 2011 and starred Jim Carrey as Mr. Popper. It was originally going to be made by Walt Disney ten years beforehand as an animated feature film.  Sequel  In 2020, Little, Brown commissioned children's book author Eliot Schrefer to write a sequel, entitled Popper Penguin Rescue. The book describes new penguin adventures of descendants of the Poppers.

Origins The family was settled in Monmouthshire in the 13th century. The original form of the name, which was resumed by the dukes of Somerset from early in the 19th century to 1923, seems to have been St. Maur, of which William Camden says that Seymour was a later corruption. It appears that about the year 1240 Gilbert Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, assisted William St. Maur to wrest a place called Woundy (now Undy), near Caldicot in Monmouthshire, from the Welsh. Woundy and Penhow, at the latter of which he made his residence, were the property of Sir Richard St. Maur at the end of the 13th century, but they were lost by the family through the marriage of Sir Richard's great-great-granddaughter, the only child of John St. Maur, who died in 1359. John St. Maur's younger brother Roger married Cecily de Beauchamp (d.1393), one of the daughters and eventual co-heiresses of John III de Beauchamp, 2nd Baron Beauchamp (1306-1343), feudal baron of Hatch Beauchamp in Somerset, who brought to her husband the greater part of her father's extensive estates in Somerset, Devon, Buckinghamshire and Suffolk. The eldest son of this marriage was Sir William St. Maur (d.1390), or Seymour (the modernised form of the name appears to have come into use about this date), who was an attendant on the Black Prince, and who died in his mother's lifetime, leaving a son Roger St Maur (c.1366-1420), who inherited his grand- mother's estates and added to them by his marriage with Maud Esturmy, daughter of Sir William Esturmy (died 1427) of Wolf Hall, Wiltshire. According to Agnes Strickland: Sir John Seymour, of Wolf-hall, Wiltshire, and Margaret Wentworth, daughter of Sir John Wentworth, of Nettlestead, in Suffolk. The Seymours were a family of country gentry who, like most holders of manorial rights, traced their ancestry to a Norman origin. One or two had been knighted in the wars of France, but their names had never emerged from the herald's visitation-rolls into historical celebrity. They increased their boundaries by fortunate alliances with heiresses, and the head of the family married into a collateral branch of the lordly line of Beauchamp. After that event, two instances are quoted of Seymours serving as high sheriff of Wilts. Through Margaret Wentworth, the mother of Jane Seymour, a descent from the blood-royal of England was claimed from an intermarriage with a Wentworth and a supposed daughter of Hotspur and lady Elizabeth Mortimer, grand-daughter to Lionel duke of Clarence. Few persons dared dispute a pedigree with Henry VIII., and Cranmer granted a dispensation for nearness of kin between Henry VIII. and Jane Seymour – rather a work of supererogation, since the parties could not be related within the forbidden degree. Although the royal kindred appears somewhat doubtful, yet it is undeniable that the sovereign of England gained by this alliance one brother in-law who bore the name of Smith, and another whose grandfather was a blacksmith at Putney.Strickland, Agnes. [1843]. \\"Jane Seymour,\\" in Lives of the Queens of England from the Norman Conquest. New York: Miller. Sir John Seymour During the next three or four generations the wealth and importance of the Seymours in the western counties increased, until in the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII Sir John Seymour of Wolf Hall became a personage of note in public affairs. He took an active part in suppressing the Cornish Rebellion of 1497; and afterwards attended Henry at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, and on the occasion of the emperor Charles V's visit to England in 1522. The eldest of his ten children was Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, the famous Protector in the reign of Edward VI; his third son was Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley; and his eldest daughter Jane was third wife of King Henry VIII, and mother of Edward VI. The Protector was married twice; and, probably owing to the adultery of his first wife whom he repudiated about 1535, his titles and estates were entailed first on the issue of his second marriage with Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Stanhope. The Protector's eldest surviving son by his first marriage, Sir Edward Seymour (died 1593), knight, of Berry Pomeroy, Devon, was father of Sir Edward Seymour (died 1613) who was created a baronet in 1611; and the baronetcy then descended for six generations from father to son, all of whom were named Edward, until, in 1750, on the failure of heirs of the Protector by his second marriage, Sir Edward Seymour, 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy, succeeded to the dukedom of Somerset. The 3rd baronet, in whose time the family seat at Berry Pomeroy was plundered and burnt by the Roundheads, had a younger brother Henry (1612–1686), who was a close personal attendant of Prince Charles during the Civil War, and bore the prince's last message to his father, Charles I, before the latter's execution. Henry Seymour continued his service to Charles II in exile, and at the Restoration he received several valuable offices from the king. In 1669 he bought the estate of Langley in Buckinghamshire, where he lived till his death in 1686. In 1681, his son Henry, at the age of seven years, was created a baronet. = Family tree = Sir Edward Seymour, 4th Baronet Sir Edward Seymour, 4th Baronet (1633–1708), speaker of the House of Commons, was elected member of parliament for Gloucester in 1661, and his influence at Court together with his natural abilities procured for him a position of weight in the House of Commons. He was appointed to the lucrative post of treasurer of the navy; and in 1667 he moved the impeachment of Lord Clarendon, which he carried to the House of Lords. In 1672 he was elected speaker, an office which he filled with distinction until 1679, when, having been unanimously re-elected to the Chair, the king refused to confirm the choice of the Commons. On the accession of James II, Seymour courageously opposed the arbitrary measures of the Crown; and at the revolution he adhered to the Prince of Orange. In 1691 he became a lord of the treasury, but losing his place three years Later he took an active part in the Tory opposition to William's Whig ministers; and in later years he was not less hostile to those of Queen Anne, but owing to the ascendancy of Marlborough he lost all influence for some time before his death, which took place in 1708. Seymour was not less arrogant than his relative the proud Duke of Somerset; but he was described by Burnet as the ablest man of his party, the first speaker of the House of Commons that was not bred to the law; a graceful man, bold and quick, and of high birth. Sir Edward Seymour was twice married. By his first wife he had two sons, Edward, 5th baronet, whose son Edward became the 8th duke of Somerset, and William, who became a lieutenant- general; by his second wife, a daughter of Alexander Popham of Littlecote House, he had six sons, the eldest of whom, Popham, on succeeding to the estates of his mother's cousin, Edward, Earl of Conway, assumed the name of Conway in addition to that of Seymour. Popham was killed in a duel with Colonel Kirk in 1669, and his estates devolved on his next brother, Francis, who likewise assumed the name of Conway, and having been created Baron Conway in 1703 was the father of Francis Seymour Conway (1719–1794), created Marquess of Hertford in 1793, and of field-marshal Henry Seymour Conway. Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford The eldest son of the Protector's second marriage, Edward Seymour (1537–1621), was relieved by act of parliament in the reign of Queen Mary from the attainder passed on his father in 1551, and was created Baron Beauchamp and earl of Hertford in 1559. In 1560 he secretly married Lady Catherine Grey, second daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and sister of Lady Jane Grey, claimant of the crown as great- granddaughter of Henry VII, on whose death Catherine stood next in succession to the throne after Queen Elizabeth under the will of Henry VIII. On this account both parties to the marriage incurred the displeasure of Queen Elizabeth; they were imprisoned in the Tower of London, and the fact of their marriage, together with the legitimacy of their two sons, was denied. The eldest of these sons was Edward Seymour (1561–1612), styled Lord Beauchamp notwithstanding the question as to his legitimacy, who in 1608 obtained a patent declaring that, after his father's death he should become earl of Hertford. He, however, died before his father, leaving three sons, one of whom, William, became 2nd duke of Somerset; and another, Francis, was created Baron Seymour of Trowbridge in 1641. The latter had at first taken an active part in the opposition in the House of Commons to the government of Charles I, having been elected member for Wiltshire in 1620. He represented the same constituency in both the Short and the Long Parliaments; and he refused to pay ship money in 1639. When, however, the popular party proceeded to more extreme measures, Francis Seymour refused his support, and was rewarded by being raised to the peerage; he voted in the House of Lords against the attainder of Strafford, and in 1642 he joined Charles at York and fought on the royalist side throughout the Great Rebellion. He died in 1664. His grandson Francis, 3rd baron, succeeded to the dukedom of Somerset in 1675; and on the death of his nephew Algernon, 7th duke of Somerset, in 1750, the male line of the Protector by his second marriage became extinct, and the dukedom reverted to the elder line, the 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy becoming 8th duke of Somerset. Henry Seymour Henry Seymour (1729–1805), a son of the 8th duke of Somerset's brother Francis, was elected to the House of Commons in 1763; in 1778 he went to France, and fixing his residence at Prunay, near Versailles, he became the lover of Madame du Barry, many of whose letters to him are preserved in Paris. He was twice married, and in addition to children by both wives he left an illegitimate daughter, Henriette Felicity, who married Sir James Doughty-Tichborne, by whom she was the mother of Roger Tichborne, impersonated in 1871 by the famous impostor Arthur Orton. Lord Hugh Seymour Lord Hugh Seymour (1759–1801), a younger son of Francis Seymour- Conway, marquess of Hertford, was a distinguished naval officer who saw much active service especially under Lord Howe, in whose famous action on 1 June 1794 he took a conspicuous part. His son Sir George Francis Seymour (1787–1870), admiral of the fleet, began his naval career by serving under Nelson; in 1818 he became Sergeant-at-arms in the House of Lords, a post which he retained till 1841, when he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral and appointed a lord of the admiralty; his eldest son, Francis George Hugh Seymour (1812–1884), succeeded his cousin Richard Seymour-Conway as 5th marquess of Hertford in 1870. Lord Hugh Seymour's younger son, Sir Horace Beauchamp Seymour, was the father of Frederick Beauchamp Paget Seymour, Baron Alcester. Sir Michael Seymour A younger branch of the great house of Seymour is said to have settled in Ireland in the reign of Elizabeth, from which Sir Michael Seymour, 1st Baronet (1768–1834) claimed descent. Sir Michael, like so many of his name, was an officer in the navy, in which he rendered much distinguished service in the last decade of the 18th century. He lost an arm in Howe's action on 1 June 1794; and between 1796 and 1810 as commander of the Spitfire, and afterwards of the Amethyst, he captured a great number of prizes from the French in the English Channel. In 1809 he was created a baronet (see Culme- Seymour baronets). Seymour became a rear-admiral in 1832, and died two years later while in chief command on the South American station. His son, Sir Michael Seymour (1802–1887), entered the navy in 1813, and attained the rank of rear-admiral in 1854, in which year he served under Sir Charles Napier in the Baltic Sea during the war with Russia. In 1856 he was in command of the China station, and conducted the operations arising out of the affair of the lorcha Arrow; he destroyed the Qing Chinese fleet in June 1857, took Canton in December, and in 1858 he captured the forts on the Pei Ho (Hai River), compelling the Chinese government to consent to the Treaty of Tientsin. In 1864 he was promoted to the rank of admiral. Admiral Sir Edward Hobart Seymour was the nephew of Sir Michael Seymour (1802–1887). Descent of the estate =Esturmy= Arms of Esturmy Wilhelmina, Duchess of Cleveland (1819–1901), in her 1889 work The Battle Abbey Roll with some Account of the Norman Lineages wrote about the Esturmy family, which held the estates of Tottenham, Wulfhall and the Savernake Forest. Sir William Esturmy (c. 1356 – 1427)Easton Royal History ) was a Speaker of the House of Commons, a Knight of the Shire and an hereditary Warden of the royal forest of Savernake Forest. he was the son of Geoffrey Sturmy (died 1381) and nephew and heir of Sir Henry Sturmy of Wolfhall. He inherited in 1381 and was knighted by October 1388. He held the post of hereditary warden of Savernake Forest from 1381 to 1417 and from 1420 until his death in 1427. He served as knight of the shire for Hampshire in 1384 and again in 1390, and also eight times for Wiltshire and twice for Devon between then and 1422. He was elected Speaker of the House of Commons in 1404. He was appointed High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1418. He held a number of public posts and served several times as an ambassador abroad. He married Joan Crawthorne, the widow of Sir John Beaumont of Shirwell and Saunton in North Devon, by whom he had no male progeny, only two daughters and co-heiresses including Maud Esturmy, wife of Roger II Seymour (c.1367/70-1420), feudal barony of Hatch Beauchamp in Somerset, by whom she had a son John Seymour (died 1464). He died at Wolfhall in 1427. =Seymour= Arms of Seymour The Seymour family (anciently de St. Maur) is earliest recorded seated at Penhow Castle in Glamorgan in the 12th century. The parish church of Penhow is dedicated to St Maur. Roger Seymour (c. 1367/70 – 1420), who married Maud Esturmy (alias Esturmi, etc.), a daughter and co-heiress of Sir William Esturmy (died 1427), of Wolfhall in Wiltshire, Speaker of the House of Commons and hereditary Warden of Savernake Forest in Wiltshire. Following his wife's inheritance, he moved his principal seat from Undy to Wolfhall. His son and heir was Sir John Seymour (c. 1395/1402 – 1464), of Wulfhall in Savernake Forest, and of Hatch Beauchamp. He served as Member of Parliament in 1422 and Knight of the Shire for Wiltshire in 1435, 1439, and 1445J. S. Roskell, The Commons in the Parliament of 1422 (Manchester University Press), p. 126 (see footnotes) He was also High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1431–1432.Mervyn Archdall, The Peerage of Ireland, p. 16 He was succeeded by John Seymour (died 1491), his grandson and heir; and then Sir John Seymour (1474–1536), the eldest son, knighted in 1497 after the Battle of Deptford Bridge, the father of Queen Jane Seymour (1508–1537). John's eldest son and heir was Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, (c. 1500 – 1552), uncle of King Edward VI and Lord Protector of England. In 1536 he was created Viscount Beauchamp of HacheDebrett's Peerage, 1968, p.1036 and in 1537 was created Earl of Hertford. In 1531 he had served as Sheriff of Somerset and during this time he probably resided at Hache Court.Cookson Thomas Gerard in his \\"Description of Somerset\\" (1633) wrote as follows:Quoted in Cookson ::\\"The mansion house in which theis nobleman lived which I went to see is soe ruined that were it not called Hach Court you would not believe that it were any of the remaynes of a Barons house. yet I sawe in the Hall Beauchampes Armes and in a little Chappell on the top of the house Seymer's, Winges \\"Or\\" in a red shield, and going a little further to the church to see some monuments I find not one, the church having bin new built long since the Beauchamps time\\". The Duke was executed in 1552 for felony on the order of his nephew King Edward VI, and was attainted by Parliament shortly thereafter when all his titles were forfeited. It was probably Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (1539–1621), son and heir of the 1st Duke, of nearby Wulfhall, who in about 1575 built the first Tottenham House, then known as Totnam Lodge, and enclosed its surrounding land to form a deer park. The Seymours were hereditary Wardens of Savernake Forest, which office together with most of their Wiltshire estates had been inherited by marriage to the daughter and heiress of Sir William Esturmy (died 1427), of Wulfhall. They were also hereditary Wardens of the royal forest of Savernake. The house was still known as the Lodge in 1623, in which year the parish register of Great Bedwyn records the baptism of the 1st Earl's great-granddaughter Frances Seymour, which was performed \\"at the Lodge in the Great Parke by Henrie Taylor, Vicar of Great Bedwin\\".Collectanea Topographica Et Genealogica, Volume 5 edited by Frederic Madden, Bulkeley Bandinel, John Gough Nichols, p.31 William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset (1587–1660), grandson, inherited the estates on the death of his grandfather the 1st Earl, his father having predeceased the latter. His grandson, William Seymour, 3rd Duke of Somerset (1652–1671) inherited at the age of 8 and died aged 19 when his heir became his uncle John Seymour, 4th Duke of Somerset (1629–1675). However, the heir to his estates in Hampshire, namely Netley Abbey (where the 1st Earl had died) and Hound, was his sister Elizabeth Seymour, wife of Thomas Bruce, 2nd earl of Ailesbury, which were soon sold in 1676 to the Marquess of Worcester. John Seymour, 4th Duke of Somerset (1629–1675), uncle, inherited the estate in 1671 on the death of the 3rd Duke, and in 1672 he rebuilt Totnam Lodge and redesigned the deer park, which at that date included long tree-lined walks and a deer \\"chase\\".\\"Marquess of Ailesbury, 1962\\", quoted in He died in 1675, aged 46, only three years after having started the rebuilding. Being childless and faced with the Dukedom passing by law to his first cousin once removed and heir male the 5th Duke, who was seated at Marlborough Castle in Wiltshire, he bequeathed the unentailed Seymour estates to his niece Elizabeth Seymour, the wife of Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury (1656–1741), and thus the Seymour estates passed to the Bruce family. =Bruce= Arms of Bruce Elizabeth Seymour's son and heir was Charles Bruce, 3rd Earl of Ailesbury (died 1747), of Houghton House in the parish of Maulden, in Bedfordshire, who in 1721 rebuilt Totnam Lodge to the design of his brother-in-law the pioneering Palladian architect Lord Burlington. Henry Flitcroft was the executant architect.Rudolf Wittkower, in Architectural Journal 102 1945, noted in Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Boyle, Richard, Earl of Burlington\\". The 3rd Earl added wings to Burlington's block in the 1730s, and also built in 1743 a Banqueting House in the park to the design of Burlington (demolished in 1824).Colvin, \\"Boyle\\". In 1746, one year before the death of the 3rd Earl, who had no son, it was apparent that on his death the Earldom of Ailesbury would become extinct and his other Earldom of Elgin would pass to a distant cousin and heir male. The former Seymour estates however he was free to dispose of as he pleased. He persuaded the king to create him Baron Bruce of Tottenham, with special remainder to his younger nephew Hon. Thomas Brudenell (1739–1814), 4th son of George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan (1685–1732) by his wife Elizabeth Bruce, to whom he also bequeathed his estates with the proviso that he should adopt the additional surname of Bruce, thus having created a new noble family bearing doubly the Bruce name, to continue the custodianship of the Seymour lands. =Brudenell= Arms of Brudenell On the 3rd Earl's death in 1747 his 8 year old nephew Thomas Brudenell duly became Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Baron Bruce of Tottenham, having inheited the barony, the estates and the Wardenship of Savernake Forest. In 1776 King George III created him Earl of Ailesbury. In 1814 he was succeeded by his son Charles Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury (1773–1856). Charles Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury (1773–1856) in 1818 added stables to the design of Thomas Cundy II. In 1821 he was granted three further titles, Viscount Savernake, Earl Bruce and Marquess of Ailesbury. In 1823–26 he enlarged and re-modelled the house, again to designs of Thomas Cundy.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Cundy, Thomas\\", \\"Wyatville, Sir Jeffry\\". George Brudenell-Bruce succeeded to his father's titles in 1856. A large church for the estate, St Katherine's, was built north of the house in 1861 by T.H. Wyatt for the marchioness, Mary Caroline (née Herbert).  References  *. Further reading Seymour, William. 1972. Ordeal by Ambition: An English Family in the Shadow of the Tudors.

In Fénelon's modern prose epic, an improvisation upon Homeric themes, Telemachus while searching for his father, Odysseus, has been shipwrecked on Calypso's island, and there has fallen in love with Eucharis but must leave her, dutifully to pursue his quest. Fénelon, in charge of the education of the heir to the French throne, admonished his readers to see the work \\"not as a frivolous novel, that is offered here, reader, for your idleness, but a learned parable\\". Its theme of the conflict between duty and love is a persistent one, central in French 17th-century classical theater, but peripheral to the Odyssey in spite of its erotic episodes. A sub-theme in Les Aventures de Télémaque, of spiritual education, is summed up by Mentor who says, \\"He who has not felt his weakness and the violence of his passions is not yet wise; for he does not yet understand himself and does not know how to distrust himself.\\" Mentor was a friend of Odysseus who placed Mentor in charge of his son Telemachus, when Odysseus left for the Trojan War. The story is perhaps best known from Jacques-Louis David's painting The Farewell of Telemachus and Eucharis, painted during David's exile in Brussels (1818), and now at the J. Paul Getty Museum. She is also depicted in Frederick Leighton's Eucharis – A Girl with a Basket of Fruit (ca. 1863). She also appears, somewhat elliptically, in Arthur Rimbaud's Après le déluge: : : \\"Then, in the violet wood, budding, Eucharis said to me it was Spring.\\" Etymology Eucharis (Εὔχαρις) is from the Greek compound εὖ prefixed to χάρις (meaning grace or charm, the prefix \\"eu-\\" denoting good or beautiful).

One of the restoration goals is the reestablishment of regular runs of coho and chum salmon, as well as sea-run coastal cutthroat trout. Puget Creek currently provides habitat for Chum and Coho salmon and Cutthroat trout. Over the years, several groups have worked to improve fish access and vegetative cover. Efforts to return salmon to the creek began in 1994 when salmon fry were released. To further encourage salmon to return, in-creek habitat has been (and continues to be) restored.

The creek is one of only three potential salmon-bearing streams within the city of Tacoma. Restoration work in the late 1990s succeeded in helping salmon return. Coho and some chum salmon reportedly returned to spawn in Puget Creek in 2000, 2002, and 2003. citation from Metro Parks Tacoma Puget Creek Tacoma Natural Area Management Plan The creek was named for Puget Park, which in turn was named for Peter Puget of the 1792 exploration and mapping of Puget Sound by the Vancouver Expedition.

It is located east of Rinella Battery and seaward of the village of Santu Rokku, and forms part of the complex of shore batteries built by the British to defend the coast east of the mouth of Grand Harbour between the 1870s and 1900s. History The construction of Fort Saint Rocco started in 1872 or 1873 by the British, as part of a program of improvements to Malta's fortifications recommended in Colonel Jervois' Report of 1866 titled \\"Memorandum with reference to the improvements to the defences of Malta and Gibraltar, rendered necessary by the introduction of Iron Plated Ships and powerful rifled guns\\". The fort was built on the site of San Rocco Battery, an artillery battery built by Maltese insurgents during the French blockade of 1798–1800. Fort Saint Rocco was the first polygonal fort built by the British in Malta, and the second one built in Malta overall (the first was Fort Tigné built by the Order of Saint John). The first fort, built between 1872 and 1873, was very small given the importance of the site. It was initially armed with three RML 11 inch 25 ton guns, but these were soon replaced with RML 12.5 inch 38 ton guns. In 1888, the fort was inspected and was described as cramped, and some alterations were proposed. Eventually, the keep and most of the battery were demolished, and a much larger fort was built in its place in 1900. The new fort was armed with BL 9.2 inch guns. On 17 May 1942, the fort fired at attacking Italian E-boats and destroyed one of them. The fort remained a functional military establishment until the 1950s. Present day The fort is located close to SmartCity Malta, a technology park which is currently under development. Care has been taken not to damage the fort during the construction of the new complex. There is no public access to the fort. In May 2015, several NGOs suggested that the campus of the proposed American University of Malta should be split up between Fort St. Rocco and the nearby Fort Ricasoli and Fort San Salvatore. This proposal will not be implemented, and the campus is to be split up between Dock No. 1 in Cospicua and Żonqor Point in Marsaskala.

Early years Roe was born on February 26, 1916, in Ash Flat, Arkansas and grew up in Viola, Arkansas. The nickname \\"Preacher\\" came at the age of three when an uncle asked his name and Roe responded \\"preacher\\" because of a minister who would take him on horse-and-buggy rides. For some time, Roe’s father, Charles Roe, played semi-professional ball for a Pine Bluff, Arkansas team before he began practice as a country doctor.  College career  From 1935 to 1939, Roe attended Harding College (now University). While majoring in education, he received a baseball scholarship and also tried his hand at basketball. At Harding, in a 13-inning game in 1937, Roe gained national attention by striking out 26 batters. Major League Baseball =St. Louis Cardinals= In the summer of 1938, Roe was signed by Branch Rickey, then general manager for the St. Louis Cardinals. Roe pitched in one game for the team that season, giving up six hits, two walks, and four runs in 2⅔ innings. He spent the next five seasons in the Cardinals' minor league system before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, 1943 in exchange for pitcher Johnny Podgajny, outfielder Johnny Wyrostek and cash.Preacher Roe, Baseball- Reference.com. Retrieved November 11, 2008. =Pittsburgh Pirates= As a fastball pitcher with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Roe had a record of 13-11 with a 3.11 earned run average in 1944 and a 14-13 record with a 2.87 ERA in 1945. His 148 strikeouts in the 1945 season led the National League and he was selected for (but did not play in) the 1945 All-Star Game. While coaching high school basketball after the 1945 season, Roe suffered a fractured skull in a fight with a referee. His pitching suffered in the following seasons, with his record falling to 3-8 and an ERA of 5.14 in 1946, and deteriorated further in 1947, as he finished the season with a record of 4-15 and an ERA of 5.25. Ralph Kiner, he said, stood in a hole in the outfield. He caught balls hit to his hole but otherwise did not field. One can get a great flavor of 'Ole Preach', as he was called, by reading Roger Kahn's book The Boys of Summer. =Brooklyn Dodgers= Branch Rickey, the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, remembered Roe from Rickey's time in the Cardinals' management and engineered a trade. On December 8, 1947, the Dodgers got Roe, and infielders Billy Cox and Gene Mauch in exchange for pitchers Hal Gregg and Vic Lombardi and outfielder Dixie Walker. With his health improving and with the spitball now in his repertoire, Roe had much success with the Dodgers, including winning records in his first six seasons with the team. Roe finished the 1948 season with a record of 12-8 and an ERA of 2.63. Selected to play in the 1949 All-Star Game, Roe pitched in the ninth inning, retiring all three batters he faced.Jul 12, 1949, All-Star Game Play by Play and Box Score, Baseball- Reference.com. Retrieved November 11, 2008. He improved further in the 1949 season, finishing with a 15-6 record and a 2.79 ERA. He pitched for the first time in the postseason in the 1949 World Series, winning Game 2 with a six-hit complete game shutout against the New York Yankees that the Dodgers won 1-0, their only win in the five game series.1949 World Series, Baseball- Reference.com. Retrieved November 11, 2008. Roe posted an exceptional 22-3 won-loss record for the Dodgers in 1951, becoming only the fifth pitcher since 1916 to begin the season 10-0. Roe was an exceptional pitcher, but notorious as a poor hitter, finishing his career with a .110 batting average. In 1953, he hit a home run at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, the only one of his career, causing fans to roar in surprise and delight. Dodger broadcaster Red Barber told his radio audience, \\"Well, old Number 28 has hit a home run, and we'll never hear the end of it, folks!\\" Roe was still pitching in the majors at age 39, unusual at the time, and was the third-oldest player in the National League in the 1954 season, his last in the majors.1954 National League Expanded Leaderboards, Baseball-Reference.com. Retrieved November 11, 2008. When asked to explain his longevity, he replied \\"Clean livin' and the spitball.\\" He described his methodology in a 1955 article in Sports Illustrated, \\"The Outlawed Spitball Was My Money Pitch\\", published a year after he retired. Roe's overall career statistics were hurt by the fact that he was away from baseball during World War II and that for two of the years he pitched for the Pirates they were among the worst teams in the National League. Contrasting the fielding of the Dodgers and the Pirates, he once said that a pitcher should pay to pitch for the Dodgers, whereas the Pirates' second baseman and shortstop were like goalposts with the ball bouncing between them. After being taken out of a game in the second inning, Roe commented that, \\"Sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you.\\"Doubtful https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/11/10/bear-eats/ Willie Mays said of Roe, \\"We used to say he had two fastball speeds—slow, and slower.\\" Sal Maglie, star pitcher for the Giants, said Roe used to have a slow fastball: \\"Believe me, it really wasn't fast at all.\\" Maglie noted that Roe would strike out hitters with it, though, by throwing it after a bunch of slower pitches, as this messed with the hitter's timing. After baseball Roe lived in West Plains, Missouri, where for many years he operated a small grocery store (now a florist shop) on the northeast corner of Broadway and Porter Wagoner Boulevard, and has a street named after him (Preacher Roe Boulevard), which included U.S. 160 north of the US 63 bypass until the city rerouted U.S. 160 and Route 17 after 2000. U.S. Route 160 still runs as Preacher Roe Boulevard south of U.S. 63. A community ball field in Salem, Fulton County, Arkansas, 18 miles from Roe's birthplace of Ash Flat, is known as Preacher Roe Park. The book Carl Erskine's Tales from the Dodgers Dugout: Extra Innings (2004) includes short stories from former Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. Roe is prominent in many of these stories.

The show aired in 1980 on CBS and continued reruns until September 4, 1982. Its episodes were eventually added to syndicated Tom and Jerry packages in 1983. Episodes of the show also occasionally appeared on Cartoon Network and Boomerang.  Description  The series is the fifth incarnation of the popular Tom and Jerry cartoon franchise, and the second made-for-television production. The series was notable in being the first attempt since the closing of the MGM studio in the 1950s to restore the original format of the cat and mouse team. After the original 114 theatrical shorts run of the William Hanna-Joseph Barbera directed series, the characters were leased to other animation studios which changed the designs, and eliminated all of the supporting characters. The previous made-for-TV Tom and Jerry Show for the ABC network in 1975 was produced by Hanna and Barbera under their own studio (with MGM), but had made the cat and mouse friends in most of the episodes, due to the reaction against violence in cartoons. The version by Filmation (Hanna-Barbera's leading competitor for TV animation at the time) was able to restore the familiar slapstick chase format, and reintroduced not only Tyke and Nibbles (here named \\"Tuffy\\"), but also some of the other MGM stars. Half-hour shows would consist of two seven-minute Tom and Jerry episodes, plus one Droopy cartoon in the middle, featuring some other characters such as Barney Bear. Spike from Tom and Jerry was used in many of these Droopy episodes as well, filling in for the other \\"Spike\\" bulldog created by Tex Avery for the old Droopy films, who was not used as a separate character here. The villainous wolf from the classic series was also included, and named \\"Slick Wolf\\". While still under the \\"Seal of Good Practice\\" code, the \\"Red Hot Riding Hood\\" character would not reappear until the following made for TV series, Tom & Jerry Kids, in 1990. Characters not seen in this series of Tom and Jerry shorts are Butch, Quacker, Topsy, Lightning and Toodles Galore. The show's opening begins with Tom chasing Jerry through a blank yellow screen. They continue chasing, as all of the other stars build a giant \\"Tom & Jerry\\" sign (similar to the second opening of Tom & Jerry Kids). The familiar rotating executive producer credit of Lou Scheimer and Norm Prescott briefly runs as Tom chases Jerry past the screen, knocking things over and running over others along the way. After the opening sequence, the wraparound segments, hosted by Droopy, would begin. He would start by painting the whole background with a single large brush stroke (making stylistic use of Filmation's characteristic \\"limited animation\\" technique), and he and the other speaking characters would engage in brief comedic sketches (like Droopy's opening poem in one of them \\"Roses are red, violets are blue, painting's my job, that's what I do; cute and somewhat wet\\"). In addition to the animation, the show was characterized by a very limited music score; all of the episodes, both Tom & Jerry and Droopy, used the same stock music, mostly created new for the series, but consisting of only a handful of largely synthesized tunes, either with minor variations or played at different speeds or pitches. This did match the chase scenes, but gave the episodes a very monotonous soundtrack, making these episodes \\"stand out\\" to many Tom and Jerry viewers when they aired. Where the original series and the third series by Chuck Jones would have favorable endings for Tom occasionally, this series followed the second series by Gene Deitch in never having definite \\"wins\\" for Tom. Also similar to the Deitch films is the character design, in them being drawn similar to the original, but still slightly different. The Droopy episodes would usually feature Slick and sometimes Spike being antagonists to Droopy. Barney had miscellaneous roles, such as being the boss of movie studio guard Droopy in \\"Star Crossed Wolf\\", and a frightful companion to Droopy in a haunted house in \\"Scared Bear\\". Frank Welker and Filmation head Lou Scheimer provided the voices for the first six episodes. Welker voiced Spike, Tyke (in \\"The Puppy Sitter\\"; the character was silent in the wraparound segments), Droopy, Slick, Barney, Tom's owner and other characters. Lou Scheimer voiced Tom, Jerry, Tuffy (erroneously giving him an adult voice, although his voice sounded appropriately higher and childlike in the wraparound segments before \\"Droopy's Restless Night\\", \\"Pest in the West\\", \\"Getting the Foot\\", \\"Old Mother Hubbard\\" and \\"The Great Mousini\\"), Slick in the wraparound segments before \\"Droopy's Restless Night\\", \\"Invasion of the Mouse Snatchers\\", \\"The Incredible Droop\\", \\"Incredible Shrinking Cat\\", \\"When the Rooster Crows\\" and \\"School for Cats\\", Barney in the wraparound segments before \\"Pest in the West\\", \\"The Incredible Droop\\", \\"The Plaid Baron Strikes Again\\", \\"Incredible Shrinking Cat\\", \\"When the Rooster Crows\\", \\"School for Cats\\" and \\"Pied Piper Puss\\" and \\"The Incredible Droop\\", Spike in the wraparound segments before \\"Invasion of the Mouse Snatchers\\", \\"Scared Bear\\" and \\"School for Cats\\" and \\"School for Cats\\", and other characters. From the seventh episode onward, Welker voiced Droopy, while the other male characters in the Tom and Jerry and Droopy segments (including Spike, Slick, Barney and Tom's owner) were voiced by Scheimer. Welker's voice was also heard in the eighth, 12th, 13th and 14th episodes as Nibbles, Slick, Barney and other characters. Additional voices were done by Lennie Weinrib, Jay Scheimer, Erika Scheimer and other voice actors, with Jay, Erika and other actresses voicing the female characters, although Welker voiced two of them and Lou Scheimer voiced twelve of them. The show itself was originally going to be called The Cat and Jam Comedy Show.

Home media  Warner Bros. currently owns the rights to The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show via Turner Entertainment. However, due to the show's negative reception and legal issues involving MGM outsourcing the animation to Filmation, Warner Bros. has no plans for a DVD box set of the show. However, one episode, \\"Jerry's Country Cousin\\", did surface on the 70th anniversary DVD collection in 2010.

Voltage drops in the internal resistance of the source, across conductors, across contacts, and across connectors are undesirable because some of the energy supplied is dissipated. The voltage drop across the electrical load is proportional to the power available to be converted in that load to some other useful form of energy. For example, an electric space heater may have a resistance of ten ohms, and the wires that supply it may have a resistance of 0.2 ohms, about 2% of the total circuit resistance. This means that approximately 2% of the supplied voltage is lost in the wire itself. An excessive voltage drop may result in the unsatisfactory performance of a space heater and overheating of the wires and connections. National and local electrical codes may set guidelines for the maximum voltage drop allowed in electrical wiring to ensure efficiency of distribution and proper operation of electrical equipment. The maximum permitted voltage drop varies from one country to another. In electronic design and power transmission, various techniques are employed to compensate for the effect of voltage drop on long circuits or where voltage levels must be accurately maintained. The simplest way to reduce voltage drop is to increase the diameter of the conductor between the source and the load, which lowers the overall resistance. In power distribution systems, a given amount of power can be transmitted with less voltage drop if a higher voltage is used. More sophisticated techniques use active elements to compensate for excessive voltage drop. Voltage drop in direct-current circuits: resistance Consider a direct-current circuit with a nine-volt DC source; three resistors of 67 ohms, 100 ohms, and 470 ohms; and a light bulb—all connected in series. The DC source, the conductors (wires), the resistors, and the light bulb (the load) all have resistance; all use and dissipate supplied energy to some degree. Their physical characteristics determine how much energy. For example, the DC resistance of a conductor depends upon the conductor's length, cross-sectional area, type of material, and temperature. If the voltage between the DC source and the first resistor (67 ohms) is measured, the voltage potential at the first resistor will be slightly less than nine volts. The current passes through the conductor (wire) from the DC source to the first resistor; as this occurs, some of the supplied energy is \\"lost\\" (unavailable to the load), due to the resistance of the conductor. Voltage drop exists in both the supply and return wires of a circuit. If the voltage drop across each resistor is measured, the measurement will be a significant number. That represents the energy used by the resistor. The larger the resistor, the more energy used by that resistor, and the bigger the voltage drop across that resistor. Ohm's Law can be used to verify voltage drop. In a DC circuit, voltage equals current multiplied by resistance. V = I R. Also, Kirchhoff's circuit laws state that in any DC circuit, the sum of the voltage drops across each component of the circuit is equal to the supply voltage. Voltage drop in alternating-current circuits: impedance In alternating-current circuits, opposition to current flow occurs because of resistance, just as in direct-current circuits. However, alternating current circuits also include a second kind of opposition to current flow: reactance. The sum of oppositions to current flow from both resistance and reactance is called impedance. Electrical impedance is commonly represented by the variable Z and measured in ohms at a specific frequency. Electrical impedance is computed as the vector sum of electrical resistance, capacitive reactance, and inductive reactance. The amount of impedance in an alternating-current circuit depends on the frequency of the alternating current and the magnetic permeability of electrical conductors and electrically isolated elements (including surrounding elements), which varies with their size and spacing. Analogous to Ohm's law for direct-current circuits, electrical impedance may be expressed by the formula E = I Z. So, the voltage drop in an AC circuit is the product of the current and the impedance of the circuit.

Artin's result provided a partial solution to Hilbert's ninth problem.  Statement  Let L⁄K be a Galois extension of global fields and CL stand for the idèle class group of L. One of the statements of the Artin reciprocity law is that there is a canonical isomorphism called global symbol map Neukirch (1999) p.391Jürgen Neukirch, Algebraische Zahlentheorie, Springer, 1992, p. 408. In fact, a more precise version of the reciprocity law keeps track of the ramification. : \\\\theta: C_K/{N_{L/K}(C_L)} \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)^{\\\\text{ab}}, where ab denotes the abelianization of a group. The map \\\\theta is defined by assembling the maps called the local Artin symbol, the local reciprocity map or the norm residue symbolSerre (1967) p.140Serre (1979) p.197 : \\\\theta_v: K_v^{\\\\times}/N_{L_v/K_v}(L_v^{\\\\times}) \\\\to G^{\\\\text{ab}}, for different places v of K. More precisely, \\\\theta is given by the local maps \\\\theta_v on the v-component of an idèle class. The maps \\\\theta_v are isomorphisms. This is the content of the local reciprocity law, a main theorem of local class field theory. =Proof= A cohomological proof of the global reciprocity law can be achieved by first establishing that : (\\\\operatorname{Gal}(K^{sep}/K),\\\\varinjlim C_L) constitutes a class formation in the sense of Artin and Tate.Serre (1979) p.164 Then one proves that : \\\\hat{H}^{0}(\\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K), C_L) \\\\simeq\\\\hat{H}^{-2}(\\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K), \\\\Z), where \\\\hat{H}^{i} denote the Tate cohomology groups. Working out the cohomology groups establishes that θ is an isomorphism.  Significance  Artin's reciprocity law implies a description of the abelianization of the absolute Galois group of a global field K which is based on the Hasse local–global principle and the use of the Frobenius elements. Together with the Takagi existence theorem, it is used to describe the abelian extensions of K in terms of the arithmetic of K and to understand the behavior of the nonarchimedean places in them. Therefore, the Artin reciprocity law can be interpreted as one of the main theorems of global class field theory. It can be used to prove that Artin L-functions are meromorphic and for the proof of the Chebotarev density theorem.Jürgen Neukirch, Algebraische Zahlentheorie, Springer, 1992, Chapter VII Two years after the publication of his general reciprocity law in 1927, Artin rediscovered the transfer homomorphism of I. Schur and used the reciprocity law to translate the principalization problem for ideal classes of algebraic number fields into the group theoretic task of determining the kernels of transfers of finite non-abelian groups.. Finite extensions of global fields The definition of the Artin map for a finite abelian extension L/K of global fields (such as a finite abelian extension of \\\\Q) has a concrete description in terms of prime ideals and Frobenius elements. If \\\\mathfrak{p} is a prime of K then the decomposition groups of primes \\\\mathfrak{P} above \\\\mathfrak{p} are equal in Gal(L/K) since the latter group is abelian. If \\\\mathfrak{p} is unramified in L, then the decomposition group D_\\\\mathfrak{p} is canonically isomorphic to the Galois group of the extension of residue fields \\\\mathcal{O}_{L,\\\\mathfrak{P}}/\\\\mathfrak{P} over \\\\mathcal{O}_{K,\\\\mathfrak{p}}/\\\\mathfrak{p}. There is therefore a canonically defined Frobenius element in Gal(L/K) denoted by \\\\mathrm{Frob}_\\\\mathfrak{p} or \\\\left(\\\\frac{L/K}{\\\\mathfrak{p}}\\\\right). If Δ denotes the relative discriminant of L/K, the Artin symbol (or Artin map, or (global) reciprocity map) of L/K is defined on the group of prime-to-Δ fractional ideals, I_K^\\\\Delta, by linearity: :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\left(\\\\frac{L/K}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right):I_K^\\\\Delta \\\\longrightarrow \\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K) \\\\prod_{i=1}^m\\\\mathfrak{p}_i^{n_i} \\\\longmapsto \\\\prod_{i=1}^m\\\\left(\\\\frac{L/K}{\\\\mathfrak{p}_i}\\\\right)^{n_i} \\\\end{cases} The Artin reciprocity law (or global reciprocity law) states that there is a modulus c of K such that the Artin map induces an isomorphism :I_K^\\\\mathbf{c}/i(K_{\\\\mathbf{c},1})\\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(I_L^\\\\mathbf{c})\\\\overset{\\\\sim}{\\\\longrightarrow}\\\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K) where Kc,1 is the ray modulo c, NL/K is the norm map associated to L/K and I_L^\\\\mathbf{c} is the fractional ideals of L prime to c. Such a modulus c is called a defining modulus for L/K. The smallest defining modulus is called the conductor of L/K and typically denoted \\\\mathfrak{f}(L/K). =Examples= Quadratic fields If d eq1 is a squarefree integer, K=\\\\Q, and L=\\\\Q(\\\\sqrt{d}), then \\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\\\Q) can be identified with {±1}. The discriminant Δ of L over \\\\Q is d or 4d depending on whether d ≡ 1 (mod 4) or not. The Artin map is then defined on primes p that do not divide Δ by :p\\\\mapsto\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{p}\\\\right) where \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{p}\\\\right) is the Kronecker symbol. More specifically, the conductor of L/\\\\Q is the principal ideal (Δ) or (Δ)∞ according to whether Δ is positive or negative, and the Artin map on a prime-to-Δ ideal (n) is given by the Kronecker symbol \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{n}\\\\right). This shows that a prime p is split or inert in L according to whether \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{p}\\\\right) is 1 or −1\\\\. Cyclotomic fields Let m > 1 be either an odd integer or a multiple of 4, let \\\\zeta_m be a primitive mth root of unity, and let L = \\\\Q(\\\\zeta_m) be the mth cyclotomic field. \\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\\\Q) can be identified with (\\\\Z/m\\\\Z)^{\\\\times} by sending σ to aσ given by the rule :\\\\sigma(\\\\zeta_m)=\\\\zeta_m^{a_\\\\sigma}. The conductor of L/\\\\Q is (m)∞, and the Artin map on a prime-to-m ideal (n) is simply n (mod m) in (\\\\Z/n\\\\Z)^{\\\\times}. =Relation to quadratic reciprocity= Let p and \\\\ell be distinct odd primes. For convenience, let \\\\ell^* = (-1)^{\\\\frac{\\\\ell-1}{2}}\\\\ell (which is always 1 (mod 4)). Then, quadratic reciprocity states that :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ell^*}{p}\\\\right)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{\\\\ell}\\\\right). The relation between the quadratic and Artin reciprocity laws is given by studying the quadratic field F=\\\\Q(\\\\sqrt{\\\\ell^*}) and the cyclotomic field L=\\\\Q(\\\\zeta_\\\\ell) as follows. First, F is a subfield of L, so if H = Gal(L/F) and G= \\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\\\Q), then \\\\operatorname{Gal}(F/\\\\Q) = G/H. Since the latter has order 2, the subgroup H must be the group of squares in (\\\\Z/\\\\ell\\\\Z)^{\\\\times}. A basic property of the Artin symbol says that for every prime-to-ℓ ideal (n) :\\\\left(\\\\frac{F/\\\\Q}{(n)}\\\\right)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{L/\\\\Q}{(n)}\\\\right)\\\\pmod H. When n = p, this shows that \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ell^*}{p}\\\\right)=1 if and only if, p modulo ℓ is in H, i.e. if and only if, p is a square modulo ℓ.  Statement in terms of L-functions  An alternative version of the reciprocity law, leading to the Langlands program, connects Artin L-functions associated to abelian extensions of a number field with Hecke L-functions associated to characters of the idèle class group.James Milne, Class Field Theory A Hecke character (or Größencharakter) of a number field K is defined to be a quasicharacter of the idèle class group of K. Robert Langlands interpreted Hecke characters as automorphic forms on the reductive algebraic group GL(1) over the ring of adeles of K.. Let E/K be an abelian Galois extension with Galois group G. Then for any character \\\\sigma: G \\\\to \\\\Complex^{\\\\times} (i.e. one-dimensional complex representation of the group G), there exists a Hecke character \\\\chi of K such that :L_{E/K}^{\\\\mathrm{Artin}}(\\\\sigma, s) = L_{K}^{\\\\mathrm{Hecke}}(\\\\chi, s) where the left hand side is the Artin L-function associated to the extension with character σ and the right hand side is the Hecke L-function associated with χ, Section 7.D of. The formulation of the Artin reciprocity law as an equality of L-functions allows formulation of a generalisation to n-dimensional representations, though a direct correspondence is still lacking.

He is of Ecuadorian and Cuban descent. Musical history Roy Mayorga was the original drummer for metal band Soulfly 1997-1999. Prior to joining Soulfly, he also played with New York Hare Krishna hardcore band Shelter in 1996. He also played drums for one of the most influential political bands from New York in the late 80s/early 90s, Nausea. Also Nausea was the band he did his first proper tour of Europe and U.S. and recorded his first album with in 1989 following. Mayorga played drums on the album The Hollowing with metal band Crisis in 1996. He was briefly a member of the band Medication from 1999–2001, when he left the group to rejoin Soulfly with which he recorded 3 and toured with them soon after. He parted ways with the group in 2003. In 2004 he helped create rock band ABLOOM as with vocalist Jasan Radford and lead guitarist Levon Sultanian. Also part of the band was Mike Doling (Snot, Soulfly) and John Fahnestock (Snot). Fahnestock left and was replaced by Marcelo Dias aka Marcello D. Rapp (Soulfly). The band is currently on hiatus but are looking to start up again in the near future. In 2005 he appeared as one of the drummers on the Roadrunner United compilation CD, The All-Star Sessions, playing on \\"The Enemy\\", \\"The End\\" and \\"Baptized in the Redemption\\", all tracks being produced and musically written by Fear Factory guitarist Dino Cazares and Roy Mayorga. \\"The End\\" spawned a music video. On another note Roy Mayorga also does classical film scoring. He has worked on films such as Legion (2004) and Shudder (2007) and when not on the road touring and is currently working on a solo record of that nature. Mayorga temporarily filled in behind the drumkit for Sepultura's 2006 European tour with In Flames following Igor Cavalera's absence. He officially joined Stone Sour on May 10, 2006 as a replacement for Joel Ekman. He drummed for their second release, Come What(ever) May, released August 1. Roy is endorsed by DW (Drum Workshop), Evans, Vater Drumsticks, PureSound and was endorsed by Zildjian Cymbals but it can be seen in recent videos that he now uses Sabian. He is the currently the drummer in Stone Sour and recently told Music Feeds TV that he has finally found his home. In October 2013, the Belgian metal band Channel Zero announced that following the death of their drummer Phil Baheux, Roy will play the drums on their upcoming album. On May 6, 2019, Mayorga was announced as Hellyeah's new drummer for their upcoming May 11, 2019 show honoring their late drummer Vinnie Paul, who died on June 22, 2018, after the upcoming Hellyeah new album was completed. Equipment This set of equipment is based on Roy Mayorga's Wallpaper for DW's new publicity campaign \\"This is my Custom DW kit\\" and is as it follows. In the picture Roys Kit has Zildjian Cymbals instead of Sabian because he used Zildjian early on for the album, Come What(ever) May. Roy also used Vic Firth sticks early on too.

The comic was adapted by Antony Johnston with artwork by Jacen Burrows from a 1994 prose story by Alan Moore (credited as \\"consulting editor\\"). Plot Aldo Sax is an FBI agent using \\"anomaly theory\\", a method that correlates seemingly unrelated data into a cohesive whole, to investigate three seemingly unrelated ritual murders around the United States. His investigation leads him to a nightclub in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where he hears of a psychoactive drug called Aklo, peddled by a mysterious veiled man named Johnny Carcosa. Sax sets up a meet with Carcosa at the dealer's apartment building, where he is given a hallucinogenic white powder as a prelude to the Aklo. Carcosa speaks an unknown language to Sax, who experiences visions of spectral planes and hideous primordial creatures, while understanding the truth that Aklo is not a drug, but the language Carcosa spoke to him. The visions, given to him by Aklo, drive Sax to murder his neighbor using the same modus operandi as the killers he was investigating.

He was a brother of Friedrich von Arenstorff. Military career Carl von Arenstorff served with the Swedish king Charles X Gustav during the Second Northern War. Arenstorff distinguished himself as an excellent cavalry officer and was promoted Major General. He was dismissed from the Swedish army on his own request. In 1673 he entered service with the Danish king Christian V and was a member of the king's council (Geheimeråd). When the Scanian War began he was temporarily in Dutch pay and was called back to Denmark. He became Commander-in-Chief of the Danish army in Scania when Duke Holstein-Pløn was dismissed on October 1, 1676, after having differences with the King. Although he had been a successful cavalry officer, he performed poorly as a commander when compared to his predecessor. Disagreements in the kings council led to poor planning of vital parts of the deciding battle on Swedish ground. Carl von Arenstorff was badly wounded by a bullet to his right arm at the initial phase of the Battle of Lund. He was shipped to Copenhagen but died from gangrene on December 10, 1676. In the king's correspondence hence after, Carl von Arenstorff was praised posthumously for his service.

It was founded in 2002 by the billionaire industrial agriculture couple Stewart and Lynda Rae Resnick. Through The Wonderful Company, their holding company, they are also affiliated with Teleflora, FIJI Water, pesticide manufacturer Suterra, and Paramount Agribusiness. In 2010, the company was warned by the FDA for making false health claims and for marketing statements that promoted their products as unauthorized drugs. Products The company's main product is pomegranate juice, which is sold in a trademark \\"double-bulb\\" bottle with the product name, POM, featured in capital letters where the O is substituted by a heart symbol. The company also manufactures blended juice beverages, such as pomegranate juice mixed with juices of blueberry, cranberry, cherry, mango or tangerine, and bottled tea- and coffee-based beverages of various flavors distributed in more conventional containers. In addition to drinks, the company sells pills and concentrated liquid products marketed as nutritional supplements. In 2017, POM Wonderful acquired the pomegranate distributor Ruby Fresh. While not part of POM Wonderful itself, another company owned by the same Resnick family, Paramount Farms, has extended the \\"Wonderful\\" brand to pistachios. The Wonderful Pistachios logotype uses a heart instead of the \\"o\\" in \\"Wonderful\\", similar to the \\"POM\\" in the POM Wonderful logo. =The fruit= The brand name \\"POM Wonderful\\" refers to the \\"Wonderful\\" cultigen of pomegranate which is grown in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley of Central California. It is the leading commercial variety in California, being well suited for juicing with its soft seeds, high water content, and wine-like flavor. POM branded products are produced from fruit obtained from their own corporate orchards, and other orchards in the same area. The company employs a proprietary process in their own facilities to mechanically extract juice for various pomegranate based products. Sponsorship of research POM Wonderful makes claims in promotional materials to have spent tens of millions of dollars for research. There are two broad types of research being sponsored and published. One type regards the proposed health benefits of pomegranate juice, the other type regards chemical analysis and bio-availability of pomegranate extracts and supplements. Pomegranate juice in general is the actual subject of its published sponsored research regarding health benefits, though POM typically supplies the juice to the investigators of the study. Published sponsored research regarding POM's extract products (pills and liquid concentrates) deal only with chemical analysis and bio-availability of said products, without examining any health benefits. Research has been conducted at various research institutions including UCLA, University of Naples, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The company has promoted these studies as indicating that consumers of their beverages and extracts will receive a wide range of health benefits against various chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and erectile dysfunction. In 2006, POM became the target of PETA for funding laboratory experiments on animals to promote health claims related to its pomegranate beverages. One such experiment sought to examine a possible correlation between pomegranates and erectile dysfunction by inducing the disorder in live rabbits. In their campaign, PETA had rebranded the company's logo as \\"POM Horrible.\\" After receiving petitions from PETA supporters and threats from Whole Foods and other retailers who said they would pull POM's drinks from store shelves if POM Wonderful continued to fund experiments on animals, the company agreed to only fund non-animal studies. Nevertheless, POM Wonderful stated that their animal tests were \\"helping to save human lives\\" and could have benefited its customers. Legal actions =FTC cease and desist order= On February 23, 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed the company in a warning letter that POM Wonderful was \\"[promoting] (POM Wonderful 100% Pomegranate Juice) for conditions that cause the product to be a drug\\". Examples of unapproved labeling cited in the warning letter come from a section of POM's website titled \\"Featured Scientific Studies\\" which contained health claims regarding \\"Prostate Cancer\\", \\"Erectile Dysfunction\\", \\"Reducing LDL cholesterol\\", \\"promote(ing) a healthy heart and prostate\\", \\"reduce(ing) the length and severity of colds\\", \\"...shown to slow prostate tumor growth\\", \\"particularly beneficial (\\"among quite a few others\\").\\" FDA contends that if the manufacturer desires to market its products with claims for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, the product is subject to the typical scientific rigor of the drug approval process to achieve such claims. POM's labeling as a food is also criticized in the letter due to a product claim of being \\"full of antioxidants called phytochemicals\\" and having \\"uniquely high levels of powerful antioxidants\\". Such nutrient content claims on food must have a scientifically validated Dietary Reference Intake value and the names of such nutrients included. Simply using the terms \\"antioxidants\\" and \\"phytochemicals\\" is not specific enough for food nutrient labeling requirements because phytochemicals in pomegranate juice have not yet been defined with actual physiological properties in humans. On September 27, 2010, the Federal Trade Commission issued an administrative complaint against POM Wonderful saying it had made \\"false and unsubstantiated claims that their products will prevent or treat heart disease, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction.\\" The complaint is a legal order intended to prevent future law violations by POM Wonderful. POM is quoted as responding that \\"all statements made in connection with POM products are true ... and as strong advocates of honest labeling and fair advertising, we are looking forward to working with the agency to resolve this matter.\\" The FDA warning letter makes it clear that it expects POM to correct \\"deficiencies in your products or ... labeling\\" within 15 days. On May 22, 2012, Chief Administrative Law Judge Michael Chappell ruled after a hearing that the company's claims were deceptive\\"Judge: POM deceptively marketed juice\\"; Associated Press, May 22, 2012 link to report on ABC news and issued a cease and desist order effective for 20 years.\\"Judge Says Pom Wonderful’s Advertising Is Misleading\\" article by Stephanie Strom in The New York Times May 21, 2012 > The greater weight of the persuasive expert testimony demonstrates that > there is insufficient competent and reliable scientific evidence to > substantiate claims that the Pom products treat, prevent or reduce the risk > of erectile dysfunction or that they are clinically proven to do so. > [POM Wonderful] shall not make any representation, in any manner, expressly > or by implication, including through the use of a product name, endorsement, > depiction, illustration, trademark or trade name, about the health benefits, > performance or efficacy of any covered product, unless the representation is > nonmisleading. The May 22, 2012 Administrative Law Judge upheld two of POM's positions: (1) any FDA pre-approval requirement \\"would constitute unnecessary overreaching\\" and that (2) more stringent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were not necessary. In January 2015, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld most of the FTC's 2010 order.\\"POM Wonderful loses bid to tout health benefits in drink ads\\"; Reuters, January 30, 2015 \\"Pom Wonderful loses appeal of FTC's deceptive advertising ruling\\"; The Los Angeles Times, January 30, 2015 The appellate court said that many of POM's ads \\"mischaracterized the scientific evidence concerning the health benefits of Pom's products with regard to those diseases.\\"Pom Wonderful v. FTC; United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, January 30, 2015 In May 2016, the FTC and a U.S. federal court decided that POM cannot make health claims in its advertising, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined POM's request to review the court ruling that upheld the FTC decision. FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez agreed with the Supreme Court's decision by stating: \\"I am pleased that the POM Wonderful case has been brought to a successful conclusion. The outcome of this case makes clear that companies like POM making serious health claims about food and nutritional supplement products must have rigorous scientific evidence to back them up. Consumers deserve no less.\\" =Minute Maid lawsuit = From 2008 through 2014, POM litigated against The Coca-Cola Company's subsidiary, Minute Maid. The lawsuit claimed that the name of the product called Minute Maid Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of five juices was misleading because it contained 0.3% pomegranate juice and 99.4% apple juice. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided in June 2014 that a lawsuit for false advertising claims could be pursued against Coca-Cola, saying \\"Competitors may bring Lanham Act claims like POM's challenging food and beverage labels regulated by the FDCA.\\" Legal analysts anticipate several more years of litigation on issues not argued in the Supreme Court, such as cause and magnitude of financial or brand injury to POM Wonderful resulting from the Minute Maid product. The Greatest Movie Ever Sold The company, product, executives and owner Lynda Resnick were featured in a 2011 documentary about product placement, marketing and advertising in movies and TV shows. The film was entitled POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

It has also been used for the treatment of various skin ailments including psoriasis, jock itch, shingles, chafing, cold sores and acne. The product was created in the 1970s by George Boudreaux of Covington, Louisiana, while he was working as an intern pharmacist. He continued to work on the formula after becoming a licensed pharmacist and sold it at his pharmacy, later naming it \\"Boudreaux's Butt Paste\\" after a physician told him a story about a patient who had referred to the product as such. Boudreaux began distributing the product more extensively after he sold his pharmacy in 1974. Manufacturing moved from Alabama to New Orleans in 2004. After Oprah Winfrey recommended the product on her show the response was so great that the company's website crashed, and demand for Boudreaux's Butt Paste quadrupled. When Brad Pitt talked of a \\"horrible diaper rash\\" in two of his children, a People magazine article asked readers for advice. It reported that in under five hours almost 900 readers responded, recommending Boudreaux's Butt Paste \\"overwhelmingly\\". In August 2005, a tide caused by Hurricane Katrina hit the area where Boudreaux's Butt Paste was manufactured, so emergency production was moved to Blairex Laboratories Inc. Soon after, the brand was sold to Blairex in Columbus, Indiana. After the sale, Boudreaux continued to work in Covington to work on marketing and developing new products based upon Butt Paste. Blairex focused on manufacturing and distribution. On December 29, 2011, Blairex sold the brand to C.B. Fleet Company, Inc. The brand became a NASCAR sponsor beginning with a Junie Donlavey-owned car driven by Kevin Ray in the Nextel Cup Series and Kim Crosby's #24 Butt Paste Chevrolet, run by GIC-Mixon Motorsports in the Busch Series. A NASCAR spokesman said to USA Today: \\"I think it's very fitting that Junie Donlavey, who has brought more drivers into the world of NASCAR than any other owner, is now being sponsored by a baby product.\\" In 2008, due to Boudreaux's Butt Paste ads on the car, Ray's No. 90 Ford was named the fifth scariest NASCAR paint scheme of all time by ESPN The Magazine for having \\"'BUTT PASTE' slapped on the rear quarter panels in giant red lettering and a cartoon baby riding on the hood.\\"McGee, Ryan.

Timken participated in the Principals Athletic Conference (PAC-7/8), before they were absorbed by Canton McKinley in 2015. Formation Timken Vocational High School was built in the 1930s by a generous gift from the Timken Foundation to the city of Canton, Ohio. As part of the Canton City School District with four quadrants and three district high schools, students could choose to take a test and enter a vocational program at Timken from any of the quadrants. Students were given opportunity to explore several occupational experiences during their Sophomore year. Their Junior and Senior year was spent in their choice of vocational program. For many years, the Timken Company hired the highest achieving Seniors and graduates from Secretarial Class, the Machine Shop, Electric Shop, Data Processing, and Welding Shop. In 1976 the city consolidated their high schools and Timken was no longer a specialized vocational high school. The name was changed to Timken Senior High School. The school colors were blue and gold. The mascot was a Trojan. The Timken Foundation generously contributed again in 1997 to the enhancement of the high school, and Stark State College joined the campus to provide early college classes. Students from the county can apply to attend early college classes, allowing students to earn an associate degree alongside their high school diploma. Grant In 1997, Timken High School received a US$10 million grant from the Timken Foundation, the largest grant to date to a single public high school. Merger With McKinley On February 25, 2015, Canton City Schools approved the merger of Canton McKinley High School and Timken High School, giving Canton a single high school for the first time since 1937. Freshmen of the merged schools attend the Freshman Academy in the current Timken High School, while grades 10–12 attend the senior high school in the current McKinley building.

Contestants attempted to determine which explanation was correct in order to win prizes. Liar's Club was first seen during the 1969–70 season with Rod Serling as host, and returned for a three-season run from 1976 to 1979, after airing as a local series on Los Angeles' KTLA during the 1974–75 season. Bill Armstrong hosted the KTLA version, which aired on Saturday nights at 7:30 pm, and briefly hosted the program in syndication during the first season in 1976–77, but was soon replaced by Allen Ludden. Bill Berry and Joe Seiter shared the announcing duties. Celebrity attorney/actress/producer Vicki Roberts was a regular researcher on the show, and she herself brought in many of the strange or unusual objects on the show, many of which were found by scouring local antique shops in the Los Angeles area. Another version of the show aired during the 1988–89 season as The New Liar's Club; Eric Boardman hosted the program, and former emcee Bill Armstrong originally served as announcer, but was later replaced by Ted Friend. This version was produced by Blair Murdoch at CKVU-TV in Vancouver, British Columbia. Game play A panel of four celebrity guests was presented with an unusual object, with each celebrity providing an explanation of the object's use. Contestants then attempted to guess which panelist was providing the accurate description. Two contestants competed on the 1969 version, while the first season of the 70s version and the 1988 revival featured four contestants, and the two seasons (1977–79) with Ludden had three. On the 1969 version, the contestant who made the most correct guesses during the episode won $100. For all later versions, contestants began the game with a set amount of money and made wagers before attempting to guess the correct object, which were then paid out at various odds if the contestant was successful. From 1976 to 1977, contestants were spotted with $100 at the start of the game, and wagered up to $100 (in $10 increments) for each prediction. Correct predictions were paid out at odds of 1:1 in Round 1, 2:1 in Round 2, 5:1 in Round 3, and 10:1 in Round 4. When Ludden took over as host in 1977, the game format largely remained the same, but the maximum in each round wager was increased from $100 to half of the contestant's current bank. On the 1988–89 version, contestants played for points, wagering between 10 and 90 points, in 10 point increments; in the first three rounds, contestants were limited to betting half their current points but in the final round, the contestants could wager all their points, but the largest wager tag given was 90 points, so the contestants could not bet more than that. Except from 1977 to 1979, the last round of the game featured artwork presented before the panel and contestants. Each celebrity would then offer his/her own title for the art, and contestants attempted to predict which title was correct. During the 1977–78 season, the final round consisted of each celebrity describing his/her own unusual item instead of just a single object or piece of art. During the last Ludden season, as a reversal in the rules of the first three rounds, contestants attempted in the final round to predict which of the four celebrities was lying in his/her description; the betting limit was removed for this round only. The contestant with the highest score won the game and a bonus prize, with (from 1977 to 1989) an additional prize awarded to any contestant who made a correct prediction in all four rounds. If two or more contestants were tied at the end of the game, ties were broken first by the amount wagered in round four. If contestants were tied in that criterion, the winner was determined by the number of correct predictions during the game. If this did not break the tie, the contestants then revealed predictions each had made regarding their final score prior to the start of the game. The contestant with the prediction that was closest to his or her final score without going over was declared the winner. Panelists Regular panelists on the Rod Serling version included Jonathan Harris and Betty White. Frequent panelists on the 1970s version included White (then Allen Ludden's wife), Joey Bishop, Dick Gautier, Fannie Flagg, David Letterman and Larry Hovis, who also produced this version. Canadian TV host and comedian John Barbour was a regular panelist throughout the 1980s version, and the three other panelists originally changed from week to week. Jimmie Walker, Shannon Tweed and Pete Barbutti later joined Barbour as permanent panelists. The Next Line In 1991, a show titled The Next Line and hosted by Kevin Frank, was produced in Canada. The format had many similarities to The New Liar's Club: both shows were taped at the same studio, and featured similar gameplay elements. However, contestants instead attempted to predict which celebrity was providing the correct next line in a video clip or song. Like The New Liar's Club, the show was produced by Blair Murdoch and featured Pete Barbutti as a regular panelist. Music During the Rod Serling series, stock music was used throughout the show. For the KTLA version, the Jack Shaindlin production music piece \\"Mad Square Rock\\" was used as its theme. When Liars Club re- entered syndication in 1976, new music by Stan Worth was used. Gary Peterson composed the music for the 1988-89 version. Syndication and episode status The 1969 Rod Serling series was syndicated through Metromedia Producers Corporation; all episodes of this version are lost except for two, one of which was included as an extra in a DVD collection of The Twilight Zone, and the other, episode 89, was posted on YouTube in 2012 by Matt Andrews (son of series creator Ralph Andrews). The KTLA version, although videotaped, exists only in film transfers. Its complete episode status is unknown, although several episodes were part of a resyndication package of the Armstrong series in 1986 by Four Star International. 20th Century Fox Television handled daily syndication of the 1976 series through 1978, with Sandy Frank Television Distributors taking over for its final season. Although episodes of the Armstrong version aired in repeats on the USA Network from April 26, 1986 to June 26, 1987, its complete episode status remains unknown, as does the status of the Allen Ludden episodes (although a few examples of both are available for viewing on YouTube). Four Star International syndicated The New Liar's Club in the U.S. during its 1988-89 season; all episodes exist and were first rerun in Canada on Prime during 1999-2000, then by Game TV from 2012 to 2015.

He is probably better known as the founder of the Continental League, which was instrumental in bringing National League baseball back to New York City with the New York Mets, and for being the namesake of the stadium where that team played for 45 years. Early life and career Shea began undergraduate work at New York University, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity, and later graduated from Georgetown University and the Georgetown University Law Center. He was a member of the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team. After graduating from law school, Shea worked for two state insurance bureaucracies before entering private practice in 1940. He accumulated political contacts through volunteer work on influential boards such as the Brooklyn Democratic Club and the Brooklyn Public Library. As one account put it: \\"Shea was neither a litigator nor a legal scholar. Rather, he was the sort of lawyer whom powerful men trusted with their secrets and whom they could rely upon as a go- between. ... [H]e earned a reputation as a man who could get things done.\\" Major League Baseball In 1958, one year after the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants left for Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, Mayor Robert Wagner of the City of New York asked Shea to chair a committee to return the National League to New York. He first tried to bring an existing franchise to New York, but the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, and Pittsburgh Pirates all refused his overtures. When requests for expansion were declined, Shea proposed a new league, the Continental League, and travelled to a farm outside Philadelphia to talk Branch Rickey out of retirement to help him. The formation of the Continental League was announced by Rickey in 1959. The Continental League would have been a third major league and would have begun play in 1961. The threat of a third major league forced Major League Baseball to discuss expansion. Two teams would be added to the American League in 1961: the Washington Senators (1961–1971) – now the Texas Rangers - and the Los Angeles Angels (now in Anaheim), and two more to the National League in 1962 (the New York Mets and the Houston Colt .45s (now the Houston Astros). With New York virtually assured of one of the new teams, Shea abandoned the idea of the Continental League. The New York Mets played their first game on April 11, 1962. In 1964, the City of New York named the stadium in which the Mets were to play in Shea's honor — Shea Stadium. In 2008, the New York Mets retired the name \\"Shea\\" on the outfield wall of Shea Stadium alongside the other elite players and managers whom the Mets have deemed worthy of such an honor over the years (Tom Seaver, Mike Piazza, Gil Hodges, Casey Stengel, and Jackie Robinson, retired by all teams at the request of Major League Baseball). The honor was carried over to Citi Field, the new home of the Mets, with the other players' and managers' numbers. It is doubtful that in the history of organized major league sports that an individual's name, as opposed to team jersey number, who was not a player or manager or owner, but an executive and a pioneer of the game, has ever been retired by any team in any arena or stadium. Currently, there are approximately 39 individuals who have been admitted to the Executives & Pioneers Division of the Hall of Fame. Of the 15 honored individuals admitted to the Executives & Pioneers Division of the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame post-World War II, Shea served as a friend, an advisor, a peer, and as counsel to no less than two-thirds thereof (Happy Chandler; Ford Frick; Warren Giles; Clark Griffith; William Harridge; Bowie Kuhn; Leland MacPhail, Sr.; Leland MacPhail, Jr.; Walter O'Malley; Alejandro Pompez; Branch Rickey; Bill Veeck; George Weiss; J. Leslie \\"J.L.\\" Wilkinson; Tom Yawkey). National Football League Shea was a one time owner of the Boston Yanks, the Long Island Indians, and a partial owner, with lifelong friend Jack Kent Cooke, of the Washington Redskins of the NFL. He further persuaded Harry Wismer to sell the New York Jets, and Sonny Werblin to buy the New York Jets, and was integral to the creation and administration of the initial annual competitions between the AFL and the NFL, now known as the Super Bowl (thanks to Lamar Hunt). He, and his law firm, Shea & Gould, also represented the Jets, Giants, Redskins, and the NFL. National Hockey League Shea was also hired by Nassau County to persuade the NHL to grant a team to the then new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, resulting in the New York Islanders, who began play in 1972. National Basketball Association Shea was integral to bringing the New Jersey Americans of the American Basketball Association to Long Island in 1968 and arranging for them to play as the Nets in the Nassau County, as well as the integration of the American Basketball Association into the National Basketball Association. Death Shea died from complications of a stroke he suffered two years earlier on October 2, 1991 at the age of 84. In 1992, the Mets wore a memorial patch on the left sleeve to honor Shea. Bill was survived by three children and 8 grandchildren. Homages Shea Stadium was the Mets' home from 1964 to 2008. *On April 8, 2008, the New York Mets retired the name \\"Shea\\" alongside other retired numbers in honor of William Shea and the closing of Shea Stadium. *On November 21, 2009, the Mets announced that the pedestrian bridge located in the outfield section of Citi Field, Shea Stadium's successor, would be named \\"Shea Bridge\\" in honor of William Shea. *To honor Shea's many contributions, commencing in 1987 and continuing today, on an annual basis during the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, the William A. \\"Bill\\" Shea – Distinguished Little League Graduate Award is presented to a former little leaguer in Major League Baseball who best exemplifies the spirit of Little League Baseball. Consideration for selection includes both the individual's ability and accomplishments and the individual's status as a positive role model. *The Bill Shea Harlem Little League Friendship Field located in Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem, New York is a flagship Little League baseball field and the home of Little League in Harlem. Shea had initiated efforts to convert a dilapidated lot that was shared with municipal leagues into a new grass field upon which Little League in Harlem could play. Through the dedication of others, the field was built, although not until 1998, seven years after Shea's death. Today, Little League is the largest organized youth sports program in the world. *In the Spring of 2014, Shea was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. *Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper Jones named his second son Shea after Jones' success in Shea Stadium against the Mets; he hit 19 home runs there, more than any other road park. *Former Cincinnati Reds shortstop Barry Larkin named his eldest daughter Brielle D'Shea, as he enjoyed playing at Shea Stadium. * David Wright named his first child born, July 23, 2016 Olivia Shea Wright after the stadium and thus after Shea himself.http://metsmerizedonline.com/2016/07/david-wright-welcomes-baby- girl.html/ References External links * William A.

The 5th Indian Infantry Division was an infantry division of the Indian Army during World War II that fought in several theatres of war and was nicknamed the \\"Ball of Fire\\". It was one of the few Allied divisions to fight against three different armies - the Italian, German and Japanese armies. The division was raised in 1939 in Secunderabad with two brigades under command. In 1940, the 5th Indian Division moved to Sudan and took under command three British infantry battalions stationed there and was reorganised into three brigades of three battalions each. The division fought in the East African Campaign in Eritrea and Ethiopia during 1940 and 1941, thence moving to Egypt, Cyprus and Iraq. In 1942, the division was heavily engaged in the Western Desert Campaign and the First Battle of El Alamein. From late 1943 to the Japanese surrender in August 1945, it fought continuously from India through the length of Burma. After the end of the war, it was the first unit into Singapore and then fought pro- Independence forces in Eastern Java.

September 1945. The Division was raised at Secunderabad in India from the Deccan District Headquarters, with two brigades of three Indian infantry battalions each. It moved to the Sudan in 1940 and was joined by three British infantry battalions already there. The division was reorganised into three brigades each with one British and two Indian battalions (as was the prevailing custom). The divisional sign of a red circle on a black background, which gave the division its nickname, was selected after the first selection of a boar's head was deemed offensive to Muslim soldiers and every other animal suggested had already been selected by other newly raised divisions. Between 1940 and 1941, the 5th Division was involved in the campaign in East Africa. After periods in Egypt, Cyprus and Syria, by 1942 it was involved in the fighting in the Western Desert of North Africa and the withdrawal of the Allied troops to El Alamein. By late 1943, the 5th Division had been shipped to India and took part in the campaign in Burma, initially deployed to the Arakan front. After the Japanese had been defeated in the Battle of the Admin Box, the division was airlifted north to take part in the Battle of Imphal and the Battle of Kohima. Thereafter, the division was almost constantly involved in the advance through central Burma until fighting ended with the Japanese surrender in August 1945. After the end of the war, it was the first unit into Singapore and then fought pro-Independence forces in Eastern Java while protecting the recovery of Allied prisoners of war who had been incarcerated there. Lord Louis Mountbatten wrote in his memoirs paying tribute to the division whose record was \\"second to none\\", saying =East African Campaign= The 5th Indian Division, under the command of Major-General Lewis Heath and comprising only two brigades at the time, was sent from India to the Sudan to reinforce the British forces there under Lieutenant-General Sir William Platt which had been attacked by Italian forces in Eritrea, at the time part of the Italian East African Empire. On 10 June 1940, before the arrival of the 5th Division, Platt had only three infantry battalions and the machine-gun companies of the Sudan Defence Force. The 5th Division started to arrive in the Sudan in early September 1940 and absorbed Platt's three British infantry battalions (the 1st Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment, the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment,) and formed a third infantry brigade. After these rearrangements, the division consisted of the 9th, 10th and 29th Indian Infantry Brigades. For the next three months, the division was involved in a series of aggressive skirmishing operations to keep the Italian forces off balance and confused as to Platt's longer-term intentions. In early 1941, Platt's forces were further augmented by the 4th Indian Infantry Division, rushed from the Western Desert after the breakthrough during Operation Compass, and an attack was launched into Eritrea on 18 January. The climax of the campaign was the Battle of Keren, a fiercely fought series of engagements against superior numbers, which ended with victory for Platt's forces on 1 April. After Keren, the 4th Indian Division was withdrawn to Cairo and the 5th Indian Division continued the campaign in Eritrea, finally joining up with elements of Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham's forces, which had advanced north from Kenya to capture Italian Somaliland and the Italian capital of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, to take the surrender of Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, the Italian Viceroy, at Amba Alagi. =North Africa and the Middle East= 9 and 10 Brigades of 5 Indian Division were newly stationed around Tobruk when Rommel's offensive against the Gazala Line commenced at the end of May 1942. Fresh to the desert, just recently equipped with obsolete anti tank guns and poor transport, they were ordered to counterattack (Operation Aberdeen) the German breakthrough. The operation was badly mismanaged by the Corps commander; tank and artillery support failed to materialise and casualties were crippling – every one of the West Yorks officers who participated was killed or wounded. The remnants were withdrawn first to Mersa Matruh then to the rudimentary defences at Alamein, where, reformed, they garrisoned the line, formed mobile 'Jock columns' and participated in successful counterattacks in the First Battle of El Alamein in July. After the Battle of Alam Halfa in August, they were withdrawn to garrison duties in Iraq before being shipped to Burma in mid-1943. =Burma campaign= At the end of 1943, the division began to take part in the Burma Campaign. It was facing the Japanese 55th Division on the coastal flank of the Arakan front. The defeat of the Japanese 55th Division in the Battle of the Admin Box, to which a large share of the credit must go to the 5th Indian Infantry Division, was the first big victory against the Japanese since they had invaded Burma two years previously. From the victory in the Arakan sector, the 5th Indian Infantry Division was air-lifted to the central front. 161 Brigade joined XXXIII Corps, which was beginning to arrive at Dimapur, and fought in the Battle of Kohima; the remainder of the division reinforced IV Corps, whose land victory at Kohima and Imphal, in which the Division played an important part, proved to be the turning-point of the Burma Campaign. Except for one period of rest and reorganization, the Indian 5th Division continued to fight and to advance throughout the rest of the war, and took part in the final thrust by IV Corps down to Rangoon. =Service after Burma= After service in Burma the Division was the first unit to be landed in Singapore as part of Operation Tiderace and was later sent to Java as part of the Allied occupation of the Dutch East Indies. It saw heavy fighting during the Battle of Surabaya in November 1945. Post 1947 After 1947, the Division was converted into a Mountain Division and is currently Headquartered at Tenga, in Arunachal Pradesh.

This reduces risks to a level considered acceptable by a society, an institution, or to specific parents. Childproofing may include restriction of children to safe areas or preventing children from reaching unsafe areas. This can be accomplished by the parent or by hiring a professional for assistance. Childproofing is gaining more prominence now that parents have greater access to information on child injury and a wide variety of products are available to help prevent it. It has become so top-of-mind for parents that even hotels and child-friendly resorts are offering \\"child-proof\\" rooms. Electrical safety One of the more common concerns of child safety is the potential for electrocution or serious injury when an object, such as a key or metal paper clip, is inserted into an electrical outlet. Many childproofing devices exist that block access to the electrical outlets. These devices may be as simple as plastic units that plug into each individual socket but this type could be removed by a toddler or parents might forget to re-insert them after using the outlet. Once removed from the outlet, most plastic plug-in caps become potential choking hazards. Other devices such as sliding outlet covers replace the current outlet plate but still allow parents access to use the outlet. The United States government publishes a free brochure for children that discusses electrical safety. Physical access Common playpen. One of the more common methods of childproofing is to move potentially dangerous items to higher levels, beyond the reach of young children. This may include small items that pose a choking hazard, sharp items that might poke or cut a child, breakable items such as glass vases and anything that is long and flexible, like ropes and cables. If you want to get a better understanding of the potential dangers around your house, getting down to the eye level of your child will make you see your house the way your child does. A playpen is another device that is commonly used as a form of childproofing, by restricting the movement of a child while resting, playing or bottle feeding, requiring a somewhat lower level of supervision while in use. Many playpens are portable, making them an alternative when the parent and child are visiting a home that has not been \\"childproofed\\". Safety gates are used to help prevent a child from accessing an area of a house, especially the stairway, or to allow an exterior door to be open for ventilation while restricting movement of a child. Pressure gates and hardware mounted gates are available. Pressure gates can be dislodged by children and should not be used at the top of stairs. In some situations, pressure gates at the top of stairs have caused serious injury when a child has run against it or when a parent has fallen trying to step over the gate. Hardware mounted gates are the most secure option and should be installed securely into wall studs. Interior doors should be closed and secured to restrict a child's access to such areas as garages, basements, laundry rooms, home offices & gyms, bathrooms, or any other potentially hazardous area. Many different types of door latches are available from simple door knob covers to top-of-door latches that can be operated from both sides of the door. Another type of lock is an inexpensive device which can be easily installed into drawers, cabinets, or other openables to prevent easy opening. It consists of a bendable plastic rod with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated on the inside of the drawer or cabinet. Water access Drownings are the leading cause of unintentional deaths for children 1–4 years old in the United States and most drownings occur in home swimming pools. A pool fence is a safety barrier that completely blocks access to a swimming pool, and may be permanent or removable. They are commonly used to improve pool safety and to help prevent small children from accidentally falling into the pool and drowning. The lack of a pool fence can greatly increase a child's risk of drowning. A four-sided isolation fence (separating the pool area from the house and yard) reduces a child's risk of drowning 83% compared to three-sided property-line fencing. Inside the home, the bathroom and the bathtub are an area for water safety concern. Parents should never leave any water in the bathtub after they have finished a bath session as only a small amount of standing water can create a scenario for drowning when left unattended. Chemical access It is common to store a number of potentially dangerous chemicals under the kitchen & bathroom sinks or in the laundry room, such as drain cleaners, ammonia, and products containing chlorine and various chemical polishes, which are one of the most common causes of accidental child poisoning. The safest solution is to relocate these hazards to an out-of-reach latched cabinet. There are also a number of special latches that lock lower cabinets and require two actions to open, reducing the chance that a small child may gain access. Medicine access Child-resistant packaging is now common for medications. There are a variety of methods to secure medications, including caps that must be pinched or pushed down while turning. It may be required by regulation for prescription drugs, for over the counter medications, for pesticides, or for household chemicals where there is a significant risk of death from ingestion. Patients can request medications come in non-protected bottles at their pharmacy, but this is not recommended for patients with young children in the home. Because some children will defeat child-resistant caps, medicine should always be stored up out of reach in latched cabinets or closets. Fire safety When childproofing a house in terms of fire safety, it is essential that the home be equipped with properly maintained smoke alarms on every level both inside and outside of sleeping areas. Smoke alarms that are linked up to one another are ideal because if one alarm sounds, they all will. It is important to make sure that there are both ionization AND photoelectric smoke alarms in the house, or a dual-sensor smoke alarm which contains both. This is because each type of sensor is specialized at detecting distinctly different, yet potentially fatal fires. Parents must be sure to test smoke alarms monthly and change alkaline batteries at least once every year. A fire escape plan is essential for all residents to know in case of an emergency. Parents of infants and young toddlers should be prepared and in agreement on what actions to take in order to escape a fire, and children should also be taught the escape plan once old enough. Ensure that safety bars on windows can be quickly removed from the inside. Disposable lighter with built-in child guard. It requires more dexterity and strength to get the abrasive wheel to rotate due to a spring cover. Disposable lighters sold in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States (since 1994) must incorporate child-resistant features. The European Union added the same standard in 2010. The inexpensive alterations have resulted in fewer juvenile-set fires and deaths. One firefighter was quoted as saying \\"Children love to play with lighters. They figure it out\\", while another fire fighting official said \\"kids' brains do not have the ability to understand how dangerous fire is, and how quickly it can spread\\". Legal aspects Due to a number of high-profile legal cases, many manufacturers now produce goods with built-in safety measures, such as child- resistant locks.

It is a special case of the general number field sieve. While it is less efficient than the general algorithm, it is conceptually simpler. It serves as a helpful first step in understanding how the general number field sieve works.  Method  Suppose we are trying to factor the composite number n. We choose a bound B, and identify the factor base (which we will call P), the set of all primes less than or equal to B. Next, we search for positive integers z such that both z and z+n are B-smooth -- i.e. all of their prime factors are in P. We can therefore write, for suitable exponents a_k, z=\\\\prod_{p_i\\\\in P} p_i^{a_i} and likewise, for suitable b_i, we have z+n=\\\\prod_{p_i\\\\in P} p_i^{b_i}. But z and z+n are congruent modulo n, and so each such integer z that we find yields a multiplicative relation (mod n) among the elements of P, i.e. :\\\\prod_{p_i\\\\in P} p_i^{a_i} \\\\equiv \\\\prod_{p_i\\\\in P} p_i^{b_i} \\\\pmod n (where the ai and bi are nonnegative integers.) When we have generated enough of these relations (it's generally sufficient that the number of relations be a few more than the size of P), we can use the methods of linear algebra to multiply together these various relations in such a way that the exponents of the primes are all even. This will give us a congruence of squares of the form a2≡b2 (mod n), which can be turned into a factorization of n = gcd(a-b,n)×gcd(a+b,n). This factorization might turn out to be trivial (i.e. n=n×1), in which case we have to try again with a different combination of relations; but with luck we will get a nontrivial pair of factors of n, and the algorithm will terminate.  Example  We will factor the integer n = 187 using the rational sieve. We'll arbitrarily try the value B=7, giving the factor base P = {2,3,5,7}. The first step is to test n for divisibility by each of the members of P; clearly if n is divisible by one of these primes, then we are finished already. However, 187 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Next, we search for suitable values of z; the first few are 2, 5, 9, and 56. The four suitable values of z give four multiplicative relations (mod 187): *21305070 = 2 ≡ 189 = 20335071.............(1) *20305170 = 5 ≡ 192 = 26315070.............(2) *20325070 = 9 ≡ 196 = 22305072.............(3) *23305071 = 56 ≡ 243 = 20355070.............(4) There are now several essentially different ways to combine these and end up with even exponents. For example, *(1)×(4): After multiplying these and canceling out the common factor of 7 (which we can do since 7, being a member of P, has already been determined to be coprime with nNote that common factors cannot in general be canceled in a congruence, but they can in this case, since the primes of the factor base are all required to be coprime to n, as mentioned above. See modular multiplicative inverse.), this reduces to 24 ≡ 38 (mod n), or 42 ≡ 812 (mod n). The resulting factorization is 187 = gcd(81-4,187) × gcd(81+4,187) = 11×17. Alternatively, equation (3) is in the proper form already: *(3): This says 32 ≡ 142 (mod n), which gives the factorization 187 = gcd(14-3,187) × gcd(14+3,187) = 11×17.  Limitations of the algorithm  The rational sieve, like the general number field sieve, cannot factor numbers of the form pm, where p is a prime and m is an integer. This is not a huge problem, though—such numbers are statistically rare, and moreover there is a simple and fast process to check whether a given number is of this form. Probably the most elegant method is to check whether \\\\lfloor n^{ 1/b }\\\\rfloor^b=n holds for any 1 < b < log(n) using an integer version of Newton's method for the root extraction.R. Crandall and J. Papadopoulos, On the implementation of AKS-class primality tests, available at The biggest problem is finding a sufficient number of z such that both z and z+n are B-smooth. For any given B, the proportion of numbers that are B-smooth decreases rapidly with the size of the number. So if n is large (say, a hundred digits), it will be difficult or impossible to find enough z for the algorithm to work. The advantage of the general number field sieve is that one need only search for smooth numbers of order n1/d for some positive integer d (typically 3 or 5), rather than of order n as required here.

It is rectangular in shape and covers about 1.8 km². Originally established in 1676 on the orders of John George III, Elector of Saxony, it has been a public garden since 1814. Pathways and avenues are arranged symmetrically throughout the park. The Sommerpalais, a small Lustschloss is at the center of the park. Originally established outside the old walls of the city, the park was surrounded by urban areas by the second half of the 19th century. Dresden Zoo and Dresden Botanical Garden were added late in the 19th century. A miniature railway, known as the Parkeisenbahn, operates in the park from April to October.

History and vegetation Many early 19th- century accounts, including Charles Darwin's (July 1836), described the volcanic island as barren with very few plants, some of them endemic to the island, not to be found anywhere else. Scientists estimate the island's native vascular plants to be between 25 and 30 species, 10 of them endemic to Ascension. A comment on This impoverished flora is a consequence of the age of the island (only 1 million years old) and isolation (over from any major landmass). Then, in 1843, the British plant collector Joseph Dalton Hooker visited the island with Sir James Clark Ross's Antarctica expedition. Hooker proposed a plan to plant the island with vegetation to attempt to increase rainfall and make life more bearable for the garrison that was stationed there. Crucially he saw the appointment of a farm superintendent as being the key to success. From that time on many plants have been introduced and Hooker's plan can be seen from one angle as an overwhelming success. An 1865 Admiralty report stated on the subject of Green Mountain that \\"(the island) now possesses thickets of 40 kinds of trees, besides numerous shrubs; through the spreading of vegetation, the water supply is now excellent\\". By the early 1900s many crops such as bananas and guavas were growing naturally. It is unlikely that this success led to an increase in rainfall, however, but increased capture of occult deposition (mist) by the greater amount of vegetation has probably resulted. The resulting cloud forest, is a mosaic of plants from a variety of habitats including woodland, grassland, and shrubland. The ecosystem that has emerged is interesting for its almost entirely artificial nature as a result of the interactions between the introduced species from a variety of disparate climates and locations. The resulting ecosystem created by the British introductions has threatened several of the few endemic Ascension island species. Because of this, Green Mountain is now a national park where endemic species are actively conserved. The mineral dalyite was first found at Green Mountain, in 1952. Geography and access The Mountain, situated within the national park zone can be accessed via the main road from Georgetown. However vehicle access does not extend to the top of the mountain. A footpath exists up to the old barracks and disused water catchment area. This continues to an observation station, where there is also a Dew Pond, formed by the collection of water on top of the mountain. The area is maintained for visitors to a certain extent, and a passage is provided through the dense vegetation. The highest point of the mountain is marked by an anchor chain, which is just up from the Dew Pond.

The ship is named in honor of Rear Admiral James Kelsey Cogswell, who served during the Spanish–American War, and Captain Francis Cogswell, who served during World War I. Cogswell was launched on 5 June 1943 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; cosponsored by Mrs. D. C. Bingham, daughter of Rear Admiral Cogswell, and Mrs. Francis Cogswell, widow of Captain Cogswell; and commissioned 17 August 1943, Commander H. T. Deutermann in command. Service history =United States Navy= World War II Cogswell arrived at Pearl Harbor 9 December 1943 for training, and there joined the screen of mighty carrier Task Force 58 for the Marshall Islands operation. At sea on this duty from 16 January to 12 February 1944, when she put into Majuro, Cogswell also bombarded Gugewe Island. She continued her screening as the carriers launched raids on Truk on 16–17 February and on bases in the Marianas Islands on 21–22 February, then sailed from Majuro to Espiritu Santo to screen carriers providing air cover for the seizure of Emirau Island from 20–25 March, and raiding the Palaus, Yap, and Woleai from 30 March to 1 April. The destroyer returned to Majuro on 6 April 1944, and a week later joined the sortie for the Hollandia landings of 21–24 April, and air raids on Truk, Satawan, and Ponape at the close of the month. Replenishment at Majuro from 4 May to 6 June preceded Cogswells assignment to screen carriers during the landings in the Marianas. On 16 June, Cogswell was temporarily detached to join in the bombardment of Guam, rejoining her force to guard it during the momentous air Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June. She continued her screening in the raids on Palau, Ulithi, Yap, Iwo Jima, and Chichi Jima from 25 July to 5 August, during the last of which she joined in the surface gunfire which sank several ships of a Japanese convoy earlier badly mauled by carrier aircraft. From 11–30 August, she replenished at Eniwetok. Cogswell in 1945. Next at sea from 30 August to 27 September 1944, Cogswell sailed in the carrier screen as strikes were hurled at targets in the Palaus and Philippines during the invasion of Peleliu. On 6 October, she sailed from Ulithi for the air strikes on Okinawa and Formosa in preparation for the Leyte landings, and fired protective antiaircraft cover for her force during the Formosa air battle of 12–14 October. After guarding the retirement toward safety of and , she rejoined her force for air strikes on Luzon and the Visayans, and screened them during the Battle of Surigao Strait, one phase of the decisive Battle of Leyte Gulf. She returned to Ulithi on 30 October, where future astronaut Alan Shepard joined the ship as a gunnery officer, but put to sea 2 days later to return to the Philippines. After was damaged by a submarine's torpedo, Cogswell guarded her passage to the safety of Ulithi, then returned to screen air strikes on Luzon, the landings on Mindoro, and the air attacks on Formosa and the China coast which neutralized Japanese bases in preparation for and during the Lingayen invasion. Cogswell screened , hit during an air attack, into Ulithi 24 January 1945, and sailed on to the west coast for overhaul. After sailing across the Pacific guarding convoys, Cogswell arrived off Okinawa on 27 May 1945 for dangerous and demanding duty as radar picket until 26 June. Three days later she rejoined the carrier Task Force 38 for the final series of raids against the Japanese home islands until the close of the war. Arriving in Sagami Wan on 27 August, Cogswell pushed on into Tokyo Bay on 2 September for the surrender ceremonies. Cogswell was given the honor of being the first USN ship to enter Tokyo Bay before the surrender. She supported the occupation in the Far East through operations in Japanese waters and escort duty to Korean ports until 5 December, when she sailed from Yokosuka for San Diego, Boston, and Charleston, South Carolina, where she was decommissioned and placed in reserve 30 April 1946. Post World War II Recommissioned on 7 January 1951, Cogswell served with the Atlantic Fleet with Newport, Rhode Island, as her home port. Between 26 August 1952 and February 1953, she cruised to ports of northern Europe while taking part in NATO operations, sailing on for duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She again cleared Newport on 10 August 1953, bound for the Panama Canal and duty off Korea and patrolling in the Taiwan Straits. Continuing westward, she sailed through the Suez Canal, and completed her cruise around the world on 10 March 1954. On 15 December 1954, Cogswell arrived in San Diego to join the Pacific Fleet. From that time through 1963, she has alternated tours of duty with the 7th Fleet in the Far East with coastwise operations. On her 1955 cruise, she took part in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands. She returned to the Far East in 1956 and each succeeding year through 1960. In 1957, Cogswell visited Australia and the Fiji Islands, and in 1958, she took part in nuclear weapons tests at Johnston Island, and patrolled in the Taiwan Straits when Chinese Communists resumed shelling of the offshore islands and threatened their assault. =Turkish Navy= Cogswell made four deployments to Southeast Asia during the war in Vietnam. Following her last deployment, Cogswell was decommissioned on 1 October 1969 and given to the Turkish Navy, where she served as TCG İzmit (D 342) until 1981. She was scrapped after her service in the Turkish Navy. Honors Cogswell received nine battle stars for World War II service.

It’s kind of ironic he’d wind up here, though, considering he grew up in the heart of Giants territory in East Brunswick, Middlesex County, N.J.... 'She would always tell me when I was in school, \\"You should be doing more,\\"' recalled Barkann, a four-sport athlete at East Brunswick High School, who later ran cross country at Syracuse.\\" Broadcasting career =Early career= Barkann started his career at NBC News in Washington, D.C. as a desk assistant. From there he went to New Jersey Network in Trenton, working at first off-camera. On February 11, 1983, after the region was hit with a big blizzard, the station asked Barkann to contribute to the telecast, filing a weather report. It was his first time on air. Soon after, Barkann hosted a program called Weather Watch, which led to him doing the weather for the news broadcast. Several years later, Barkann started doing backup sports for the network, at age 26. A few months later, Barkann moved to KYW-TV in Philadelphia as a sports reporter. Barkann spent five years at KYW-TV but did not have his contract renewed, leading him to a job in Boston, where he became sports director at WLVI-TV. However, five years in, Barkann received \\"an unbelievable opportunity\\" and returned to Philadelphia, beginning his current role as host/reporter at NBC Sports Philadelphia, in Philadelphia, starting in 1997. =Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia / NBC Sports Philadelphia= On October 1, 1997, Barkann brought the network on the air as host of Daily News Live. The success of Barkann's Daily News Live sparked many other SportsNet affiliates to establish similar programs. Throughout his career, Barkann has hosted Eagles Post Game Live, which currently features former Governor of Pennsylvania and former Mayor of Philadelphia Ed Rendell, Hall of Famer (Writer's Honor Roll) Ray Didinger, and former Eagle Brian Westbrook. Barkann also hosted Monday Night Live and a program called Spotlight, which are both now off the air. Barkann also hosts the Postgame Live programs for the Phillies, Flyers and Sixers whenever the team is in or near the playoffs. Notable moments at Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia / NBC Sports Philadelphia Barkann was overcome with emotion when hosting a live postgame show the day Harry Kalas died in Washington. Barkann, through tears, called Kalas a \\"sound of summer\\" and the \\"soundtrack of our lives\\". Barkann said Kalas was a \\"great, great man\\", reported that \\"the voice is silent tonight\\". Barkann was also highly praised for his job hosting Kalas' memorial service, held at Citizens Bank Park. Before going on air for Phillies Postgame Live, Barkann, along with former Phillies all-stars Ricky Bottalico and Darren Daulton, watched Game 4 of the 2009 NLCS from their set. When Jimmy Rollins hit a memorable walk-off double to the gap in right-center, Barkann and crew exploded. In footage captured by an idle studio camera and later released to the public, Bottalico can be seen saying \\"that's winning the game, that's winning the damn game\\" and Barkann throwing his hands in the air and yelling \\"this team is incredible, this team is unbelievable!\\" The video was used as part of the Phillies pregame montage shown on their video board at Citizens Bank Park during the 2010 postseason. While working for KYW-TV, Barkann did a piece called \\"Birds Eye View\\" during which Coach Buddy Ryan allowed him to \\"try out\\" for the team. Barkann lined up at receiver with Randall Cunningham at QB. Troy West, the DB, lined up against Barkann, who Barkann later recalled \\"threw me ten feet in the air.\\" When asked about Barkann's performance, Mike Quick said, \\"I thought he was going to be bad, but that was just sad.\\" =National broadcasting career= Barkann's career has also included many national jobs. Most notably, he served as a field reporter for USA Network's coverage of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships from 1991-2008. In 2009, coverage shifted to ESPN and Barkann was left off the broadcast team. Since leaving the Open, Barkann has covered the Billie Jean King Cup for HBO Sports. Held at Madison Square Garden and shown nationally on HBO, the event featured a final of Serena Williams against her sister Venus. Barkann's career has also included reporting for CBS. With CBS he has covered major events, including the Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan in 1998, and the Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway in 1994 as a speed skating reporter covering Dan Jansen, who won a Gold Medal in the 1000m. In 1992, Barkann was a reporter at the 1992 Winter Olympic Games in Albertville, France where he covered the Dan Jansen story. Barkann's career also involved the NCAA he has covered the Final Four and Fiesta Bowl for CBS as well as Big 5 Basketball events and telecasts. In 2009, Barkann also hosted the finale of Being John Daly for the Golf Channel. Barkann is also a former XFL commentator. He worked the UPN (now CW) game telecasts. Notable national broadcasting moments During Barkann's time at the Open, fans grew accustomed to his off-beat, fun interview style. One of the first stories Barkann did for USA was on a hot dog stand that players had mentioned smelling during their matches. His piece included an interview with the vendor, who insisted if the players came and tried his hot dogs all would be well. Another famous moment came back in 1992 with Barbra Streisand, who was then rumored to be dating Andre Agassi. Barkann asked Streisand, \\"what moves you about him on the court,\\" to which she replied, \\"he's so evolved, more so than his linear years and he plays like a zen master out there.\\" This interview marked the first time Streisand talked publicly about her relationship with Agassi and it made big news at the time. In 2007, Barkann interviewed Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David. Barkann asked the two what the funniest thing they had seen at the Open was, to which Seinfeld replied, \\"not you.\\" At the 2008 Open, Barkann asked Novak Djokovic in his on-court post match interview (which was not only broadcast to the television audience, but over the PA system at Arthur Ashe stadium) to do his famous, but never before seen impersonations. Djokovic did his Maria Sharapova and Rafael Nadal impersonations, becoming an instant sensation on YouTube (getting over one million hits) and in tennis circles. Ironically, Barkann's last interview at the US Open was another attention-getter with Novak talking in front of a sea of angry booing fans about how they were only cheering for Andy Roddick because they thought he had \\"16 injuries\\". Personal life Barkann resides with his wife Ellen in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. Ellen was instrumental in the startup of The Philadelphia Sports Group, which serves as a talent marketing agency for local and national athletes and sports media members. Barkann read the eulogy at former colleague and MLB catcher John Marzano's funeral and frequently recalls the shortened life of his great friend. He also spoke at Daily News columnist Phil Jasner's funeral, along with Doug Collins. Barkann was the subject of part of Bill Conlin's speech at his induction to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Michael, along with his wife Ellen Barkann, started the Barkann Family Healing Hearts Foundation in the beginning of 2013.

The term \\"kitsch\\" came into use in the 1860s or 1870s in Germany's street markets.  Key ideas  Greenberg believed that the avant- garde arose in order to defend aesthetic standards from the decline of taste perpetuated by the mass-production of consumer society, and saw kitsch and art as opposites. One of his more controversial claims was that kitsch was equivalent to Academic art: \\"All kitsch is academic, and conversely, all that is academic is kitsch.\\" He argued this based on the fact that Academic art, such as that in the 19th century, was heavily centered in rules and formulations that were taught and tried to make art into something learnable and easily expressible. He later came to withdraw from his position of equating the two, as it became heavily criticized. Sources * Greenberg, Clement. Art and Culture. Beacon Press, 1961 * Greenberg, Clement.

He fought for the Takeda at the Mimasetoge (1569). In the 1572 Mikatagahara, he led the cavalry vanguard. At the Battle of Nagashino (1575), he supplied the largest cavalry contingent, commanding 500 mounted samurai and 1000 footmen.

History The Ubbo-Emmius-Gymnasium was founded in 1584 as a High School for boys only and girls were not accepted before 1972. It was named after Ubbo Emmius, who was principal at the former Latin school from 1588 to 1596, today being the Ubbo-Emmius-Gymnasium. The older parts of the present school building originate from 1909. In 1973, the building had to be expanded with the increasing number of pupils. In 1998, a small separate building with six classrooms was established on the school grounds. When the school system in Lower Saxony changed upon elimination of the Orientierungsstufe additional school buildings in proximity to the Ubbo-Emmius-Gymnasium were affiliated with it. Current situation With about 1300 students, the school is one of the largest of the area and is known for its good quality and special support for their students in many educational branches, e.g.: * Foreign languages (e.g. general subjects taught in foreign languages are available) * Music (e.g. big choir, school band, orchestra) * Mathematics * Science and technology (e.g. special lessons for interested students in profiles) Students can take part in exchange programmes (especially to France - Evreux, the US - Topeka/Kansas and to China) and recently to the UK (Bristol).

It authorized the construction of 20 new United States Navy ships: 19 cruisers and 1 aircraft carrier. Two Portland-class cruisers were laid down in 1930; original plans called for a class of six, but four were later altered into New Orleans-class cruisers shortly after being laid down in 1930 & 1931\\\\. Three more New Orleans-class were also laid down, in 1931, 1933 and 1934.

Several factors could have affected construction; among them, the London Naval Conference 1930. The most likely explanation for the delays, however, was the strict government economies related to the Great Depression; it is notable that in 1932–4, new construction almost stagnated. With the New Deal, and a willingness to spend money, this slowly turned around; the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 1933 was used to authorise the completion of various vessels, and following this the last two New Orleans-class were laid down. In 1934, a new naval construction bill, the Vinson-Trammell Act was passed, providing a systematic program of ship replacement for the Navy throughout the decade and superseding the remnants of the Cruiser Act plans.

Eutychianism is a monophysite understanding of how the human and divine relate within the person of Jesus Christ. Eutychians were often labelled Phantasiasts by their adversaries, who accused their Christology of reducing Jesus' incarnation to a phantasm.Sergey Minov, \\"Date and Provenance of the Syriac Cave of Treasures: A Reappraisal\\", Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies 20,1 (2017): 129–229, esp. at 141–145. Overview At various times, Eutyches taught that the human nature of Christ was overcome by the divine or that Christ had a human nature but it was unlike the rest of humanity. One formulation is that Eutychianism stressed the unity of Christ's nature to such an extent that Christ's divinity consumed his humanity as the ocean consumes a drop of vinegar. Eutyches maintained that Christ was of two natures but not in two natures: separate divine and human natures had united and blended in such a manner that although Jesus was homoousian with the Father, he was not homoousian with the man.A History of Heresy, David Christie-Murray, 1976 Eutychianism was rejected at the Fourth Ecumenical Council in Chalcedon in 451 and the statement of faith known as the Chalcedonian Creed. The reaction against Eutychianism also led to the schism with Oriental Orthodoxy. Historical background As the Christian Church grew and developed, the complexity of its understanding of the Triune God and the person of Christ also grew and developed. It's important to understand the controversies of Christology regarding its parallel with the organisation of the church, as they are ideally united as one, the latter seen as the body of Christ. The issue of how to reconcile the claims of monotheism with the assertion of the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth was largely settled at the First Ecumenical Council held at Nicaea (325). Especially among the Greek- speaking Christians, attention turned to how to understand how the second person of the Trinity became incarnate in the person of Jesus Christ.Alister McGrath, Christian Theology: An Introduction (Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1994) 281-282. The Nicene Creed said of Jesus that he was \\"of one Being (ousia) with (God) the Father\\" and that he \\"was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became truly human.\\"Nicene Creed, trans. by the English Language Liturgical Consultation (ELLC), published in Praying Together (1988). However, neither the Nicene Creed nor the canons of the Council provided a detailed explanation of how God became human in the person of Jesus, leaving the door open for speculation. One such theory of how the human and divine interact in the person of Jesus was put forward by the Patriarch of Constantinople, Nestorius (c. 386–451). Nestorius, a student of the Antiochene school of theology, taught that in the incarnation two distinct hypostases (\\"substances\\" or, as Nestorius' critics such as John Cassian and Cyril of Alexandria employed the term, \\"persons\\") were conjoined in Jesus Christ: one human (the man) and one divine (the Word).\\"Nestorianism\\" in The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology, ed. A. Richardson and J. Bowden (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1983). The charges against Nestorius, who supposedly taught that there were \\"two Christs\\", were probably distortions of his teachings. However, he seemingly taught a radical duophysitism, an emphasis on the two natures of Christ instead of on one person of Christ. See, for example, Susan Ashbrook Harvey, \\"Nestorianism\\" in the Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, ed. Everett Furgeson (New York: Garland Pub, 1997). Thus, Mary should not be considered the God-bearer (Theotokos) since she only contributed to and bore the human nature of Christ, making her the Christotokos. Nestorius and his teachings were condemned by the Third Ecumenical Council, held in Ephesus in 431, which defined the Church of the East.For more info, see Nestorius and Nestorianism. The Council of Ephesus did not answer the question of how the human and divine interrelated in the person of Christ, it seemingly rejected any attempted answer that stressed the duality of Christ's natures to the expense of his unity as a single hypostasis (understood to mean \\"person\\"). Eutyches and Chalcedon In response to Eutychianism, the Council adopted dyophysitism, which clearly distinguished between person and nature by stating that Christ is one person in two natures but emphasized that the natures are \\"without confusion, without change, without division, without separation\\". The Miaphysites rejected that definition, as verging on Nestorianism, and instead adhered to the wording of Cyril of Alexandria, the chief opponent of Nestorianism, who had spoken of the \\"one (mia) nature of the Word of God incarnate\\" ( mia physis tou theou logou sesarkōmenē).John McGuckin (2004), Saint Cyril of Alexandria and the Christological Controversy, p140 et al The distinction of the stance was that the incarnate Christ has one nature, but it is still of both a divine character and a human character and retains all the characteristics of both, with no mingling, confusion or change of either nature. Miaphysites condemned Eutychianism.

The first three seasons aired on Sunday nights at 8:00pm Eastern Time, directly opposite The Ed Sullivan Show. It moved to Mondays at 10:00pm Eastern in the 1959–60 season under the name The Steve Allen Plymouth Show (sponsored by Plymouth automobile). After a season's absence, the series briefly returned on Wednesdays at 7:30pm Eastern. The syndicated version aired mostly in late nights. The program, between September 1957 and June 1960, became one of the first programs to be telecast in \\"compatible color\\". Kinescopes of the NBC version were later edited into 104 half-hour episodes and rerun on the short-lived \\"HA!\\" channel and Comedy Central in the early 1990s, with new introductions by Allen. Overview The Steve Allen Show was the first in a series of prime time spin-offs from The Tonight Show, all of which were named after the host: Jack Paar (1962 to 1965) and Jay Leno (2009 to 2010) would follow in Allen's footsteps. The show launched the careers of cast members Don Knotts, Tom Poston, Louis Nye, Pat Harrington, Jr., Bill Dana, and, near the end of its run, Jim Nabors. The show's most popular sketch was the \\"Man on the street\\" which featured Knotts as the nervous Mr. Morrison (whose mannerisms Knotts would later use for Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show), Poston as the man who could not remember his own name, Harrington as Italian golf player Guido Panzini, Nye as the smug Gordon Hathaway, and Dana as José Jiménez. Hathaway's greeting of \\"Hi Ho Steverino!\\" became a catchphrase as did Jimenez's \\"My name José Jiménez.\\" Dayton Allen also appeared in the sketch and spawned the catchphrase \\"Whyyyyy not?\\" Gabe Dell, previously a member of The Bowery Boys, was also a cast member. Gene Rayburn was the show's announcer and Skitch Henderson was the bandleader. The Steve Allen Show also helped foster the careers of many musicians. Although Allen himself did not have much affection for rock and roll,Austen, Jake, TV A-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol (2005), p.13 the show featured numerous rock and roll artists in their earliest TV appearances. The show presented Elvis Presley, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Louis Jordan & The Tympany Five, The Treniers, and The Collins Kids.http://www.tv.com/the-steve-allen- show/show/1465/episode_guide.html?season=All However, the rock 'n' roll stars often did not appear on the show as most fans would have desired. For instance, Allen presented Elvis Presley with a top hat and the white tie and tails of a \\"high class\\" musician while singing \\"Hound Dog\\" to an actual Basset Hound, who was similarly attired.See Austen, Jake, TV-A-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol (2005), p.13. Some have erroneously suggested that the \\"Hound Dog\\" performance was intentionally disrespectful, and emblematic of Allen's disdain for rock 'n' roll.Dundy, Elaine, Elvis and Gladys (University Press of Mississippi, 2004), p. 259. In reality, Allen took a risk booking the controversial Presley, and the bit was orchestrated both for comedic effect, and to mitigate potential controversy.Glenn C. Altschuler, All Shook Up: How Rock 'n' Roll Changed America (Oxford University Press, 2003), p.90. Indeed, Presley's label, RCA Records, chose an image from this performance to adorn the picture sleeve of the 45 rpm single of \\"Hound Dog\\", which had not yet been released at the time of the Allen appearance. That show drew the largest audience in the history of the Steve Allen Show, an estimated 40 million viewers garnering for NBC a 20.2 rating (against CBS's Sullivan's 14.8) as well as a 55.3% share vs Ed Sullivan's 39.7% After being cancelled by NBC in 1960, the show returned in the fall of 1961 on ABC. Nye, Poston, Harrington, Dell, and Dayton Allen returned. New cast members were Joey Forman, Buck Henry, and newcomers Tim Conway (then known as Tom Conway) and The Smothers Brothers. Allen's wife, Jayne Meadows also joined the cast. The new version was cancelled after 14 episodes. In 1967, after trying his hand at a syndicated talk show several years earlier, Allen briefly returned on CBS with most of his old regulars for The Steve Allen Comedy Hour, an eight-week summer replacement series on Wednesdays at 10:00pm Eastern (replacing the cancelled Danny Kaye Show). 21 minutes of the premiere episode featured one of Allen's favorite sketches, \\"The Prickly Heat Telethon\\", which Allen ran on film in its entirety at his 1973 Carnegie Hall concert. The short-lived series featured the debuts of Rob Reiner, Richard Dreyfuss, and John Byner, and featured Ruth Buzzi, who would become famous soon after as a regular on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. Syndication A syndicated version of The Steve Allen Show, known informally as the Westinghouse Show, ran, through Westinghouse Broadcasting, from June 1962 to October 1964. It was taped at what would later become known as The Steve Allen Playhouse in Hollywood and followed Allen's original 90-minute Tonight format.http://cinematreasures.org/theater/1419 Why Allen decided not to return to Tonight himself was not clear, especially considering Jack Paar had just left the show and the position was open. He instead ended up competing against new Tonight host Johnny Carson. Original announcer Gene Rayburn and bandleader Skitch Henderson did not return to this version (Rayburn was by this time hosting The Match Game on NBC and Henderson opted to rejoin Tonight under Carson), instead being replaced by Johnny Jacobs as announcer and Donn Trenner as bandleader, respectively (in early 1964, Bill Daily succeeded Jacobs as Steve's announcer). Following a dispute with Westinghouse over creative control, Allen left the show in 1964 to take over hosting duties on I've Got a Secret, and a young Regis Philbin briefly took over the reins in its final weeks. The Trenner orchestra included some of the finest West Coast jazz musicians, among them guitarist Herb Ellis, trombonist- scat vocalist Frank Rosolino and saxophonist-trombonist Bob Enevoldsen. The Allen Westinghouse Show is considered a classic of American late-night talk shows today, given its professed influence on a number of comedy greats including David Letterman, Robin Williams, Steve Martin, Harry Shearer and others impressed by its wild, anarchic style, complete with outdoor stunts staged near the Hollywood Ranch Market, not far from the studio. The show's guests included such Southern California eccentrics as health food enthusiast Gypsy Boots, popular TV physics professor Julius Sumner Miller, Miles Davis and his group (1964), Lenny Bruce, Peter Sellers, Jackie Vernon (in his first television appearance), and a young Frank Zappa, who appeared as a \\"musical bicyclist.\\" In April 1968, a year after I've Got a Secret ended its run, Allen returned to syndicated nightly variety-talk with another new series, this one distributed by Filmways. Although more conversational in tone than his previous entry, it did feature the same wacky stunts that would influence David Letterman in later years, including becoming a human hood ornament; jumping into vats of oatmeal and cottage cheese; and being slathered with dog food, allowing dogs backstage to feast on the free food. Allen also introduced Albert Brooks and Steve Martin for the first time to a national audience on the Filmways series, which ran until November 1969. After a hiatus of about 14 months, starting in early 1971, a mustachioed Allen returned to syndication to host a less memorable version of the 1968–69 Filmways show. However, it disappeared after a few months.

Philo of Byzantium encountered and described a weapon similar to the polybolos, a catapult that like a modern machine gun could fire again and again without a need to reload.Philo of Byzantium, \\"Belopoeica\\", 73.34 Philo left a detailed description of the gears that powered its chain drive, the oldest known application of such a mechanism, and that placed bolt after bolt into its firing slot.  Design  Arsenal of ancient mechanical artillery in the Saalburg, Germany; left: polybolos reconstruction by the German engineer Erwin Schramm (1856–1935) The polybolos would have differed from an ordinary ballista in that it had a wooden hopper magazine, capable of holding several dozen bolts, that was positioned over the mensa (the cradle that holds the bolt prior to firing). The mechanism is unique in that it is driven by a flat- link chain connected to a windlass. The mensa itself was a sliding plank (similar to that on the gastraphetes) containing the claw latches used to pull back the drawstring and was attached to the chain link. When loading a new bolt and spanning the drawstring, the windlass is rotated counterclockwise by an operator standing on the left side of the weapon; this drives the mensa forward towards the bow string. At the very front, a metal lug at the front trigger the latching claws into catching the drawstring. Once the string is held firm by the trigger mechanism, the windlass is then rotated clockwise; pulling the mensa back and drawing the bow string with it. At the same time, a round wooden pole in the bottom of the magazine is rotated via a spiral groove being driven by a rivet attached to the sliding mensa; dropping a single bolt from a carved notch in the rotating pole. With the drawstring pulled back and a bolt loaded on the mensa, the polybolos is ready to be fired. As the windlass is rotated further back to the very back end, the claws on the mensa meets another lug like the one that pushed the claws into catching the string. This one causes the claws to disengage the drawstring and automatically fires the loaded bolt. Upon the bolt being fired, the process is repeated. The repetition provides the weapon's name, in Greek , \\"throwing many missiles\\",πολυβόλος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library from (), \\"multiple, many\\"πολύς, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library and () \\"thrower\\", in turn from (), \\"to throw, to hurl\\",βάλλω, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library literally a repeating weapon.

Prelude On July 12 the Swedish army of 10,000 men had been reinforced with 4,000 peasants from Småland and left its camp near Klippan to march south. The Swedes planned to attack the Danish army that had been weakened by losses at Malmö before reinforcements could arrive from Germany and Austria via Landskrona. The Danes however, had already returned to Landskrona and camped on the hills west of the town. The battle Early in the morning of July 14, Charles XI formed his army into four columns and started advancing towards the Danes. But as soon as the Swedes got the enemy camp in sight they noticed that it was empty. This caused some confusion among the Swedish generals. Most of them assumed that Christian V had retreated to Landskrona and that the Swedes should abort the operation. However Charles was determined to deliver battle and kept his army marching towards the Danish camp. During the night Christian had moved his army down from the hills and lined it up behind an earth wall with the intention of ambushing the Swedes on the moor. The Swedish General Ascheberg spotted the Danish troops behind the wall. The Swedish army paused for about one hour and at nine o'clock formed itself into two lines at the north-east end of the moor. Although his generals advised against it, Christian decided to leave his favorable position behind the wall and attack the Swedes. The two armies started advancing towards each other and were soon separated only by a small valley. The artillery exchanged fire but none of the sides were willing to attack across the dale. Finally Charles XI and his guard on the right wing charged down the slope and up the other side. They were immediately surrounded and almost taken prisoner, but saved by the Household cavalry. The rest of the Swedish right wing followed and the battle began. After less than one hour the Danish left wing was routed and the Danish artillery was in Swedish hands. On the Danish right Christian V out-flanked the Swedes and when Field Marshal Simon Grundel-Helmfelt was killed the Swedish left wing was scattered. However, backed up by the 4,000 peasants, the Swedes managed to escape and reorganize their left wing. In the center the Danes took the initiative when General Russenstein attacked soon after both flanks were engaged. But as his left flank was unprotected it took a lot of beating and the Danish center slowly started dissolving. As the Swedish cavalry that had pursued the Danish left wing returned to the battle, the reorganized Swedish left wing was ready for action. And since Christian V was unable to overpower the left flank of the Swedish center, he left the field at 16:00. By 18:00 all Danish troops had quit the field and the Swedes retired to the former Danish camp. Aftermath Reasons for the Danish defeat are said to be rivalry between Danish generals and that the Danish units had been mixed up during the night. The Danes also failed to exploit their success on the right wing, which gave the Swedes time to reorganize their units. Though unquestionably a Swedish victory the battle had little influence on the outcome of the war. As long as the Danes were victorious at sea and held the fortified town of Landskrona they could easily bring reinforcements to Scania. The Swedish army now counted 7,000 men, but this was not enough to take Landskrona. After a couple of skirmishes around Kristianstad, the main part of the Swedish army marched back north to Sweden proper to find winter quarters, while Christian V shipped some of his troops back to Zealand.

It was originally broadcast on ABC on December 23, 1979. A musical-based parody of both the Scooby-Doo formula and of Hollywood in general, the story line centered on Shaggy convincing Scooby that both of them deserve better than being stars in what he considers a low-class Saturday morning show, and attempts to pitch a number of potential prime-time shows to network executive \\"C.J.\\" (voiced by Rip Taylor), all of which are parodies of movies and then-popular TV shows which are How The West Was Won, Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, Superman, The Sound of Music, Saturday Night Fever, Sonny & Cher, The Love Boat, and Charlie's Angels. Caught in the middle of this ordeal are Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Scooby's loyal Saturday morning fan base; all of whom convince Scooby to come back to his Saturday morning TV show. The movie was first released on VHS by Worldvision Enterprises in the 1980s, and is currently available on DVD from Warner Home Video. Plot Scooby-Doo and the rest of the Mystery Inc. gang have solved so many mysteries and become so popular that they now have their own television show in Hollywood based on their adventures. One day, after Scooby and Shaggy run from \\"The Crabby Creature of Creepy Crag\\", they start getting tired of doing the same routine after falling into a catapult, and decide to become real movie stars. They show the president of a network, C.J., a pilot film called How Scooby Won the West, where Sheriff Scooby and Deputy Shaggy undergo the ornery Jesse Rotten. C.J. believes the film is a joke, and throws Shaggy and Scooby out, laughing. After the gang finds out Scooby is leaving the show, they are heartbroken and protest while Shaggy tells them how Scooby will become famous. At the roller-skating rink, Shaggy is filming another pilot (Lavonne and Scooby) while Lavonne skates with Scooby, turning out to be a disaster with several accidents such as when they accidentally crash into Shaggy while filming. They show another film called Scooby Days where \\"the Scoob\\" meets \\"the Groove\\", an obvious parody of the Fonz, in Harold's Drive- In. C.J. suggests that Scooby go back to his own show. Scooby refuses, later trying to mingle with celebrities. Back in the gang's dressing room, Fred reads the newspaper in shock, making all of them miss Scooby and Shaggy terribly and wish they came back on the show. Looking at a theater, Scooby imagines a premiere of his two new movies (Super Scooby and The Sound of Scooby). In Super Scooby, he saves a Lois Lane clone from a rocket heading toward Big City, only to get blown up himself. In The Sound of Scooby, Scooby wears a pink dress, twirls in the mountain, but as he begins to sing, he falls down a cliff into a stream. Back at the Chinese theater, Shaggy finds out that the studio is holding dog auditions to replace Scooby's role on his show. He and Scooby go down to see the results of the auditions, and have a laugh upon witnessing the terrible performances. Without them knowing, it is actually a trick set up by C.J. and the rest of the gang to get Scooby back on the show once again. C.J. hires a dog with no talent to take Scooby's role, leaving Scooby and Shaggy in shock. Later, Shaggy shows C.J. a new film, Scooby and Cherie where Scooby is a magician and Cherie, his assistant. The next film is The Love Ship where Captain Scooby forgets to untie the rope from the piers, taking all the people on it with the cruise. To confirm his new career, Scooby is featured on The Jackie Carson show, saying he's leaving his cartoon series, upsetting his fans. The next (and last) pilot film shown is Scooby's Angels where the Angels look into criminal headquarters and Scooby lands from an aeroplane without a parachute. Scooby then yells, \\"Rop the rameras! Rop the rameras!\\" in which C.J. agrees. C.J. then reveals a massive crowd of Scooby’s fans outside chanting \\"Scooby-Doo, we need you!\\". Fred, Daphne, and Velma are among them. In fact, all across Los Angeles, Scooby’s fans are begging him to come back. Upon seeing this, Scooby realizes everyone loves him for who he is and agrees to go back to his original show. After things have quieted down in C.J.'s office, Shaggy (who doesn't want to go back so easily) knocks on the door, showing him the tape of his own pilots such as \\"Mork and Shaggy\\", \\"Welcome Back, Shaggy!\\", and \\"Shaggy and Hutch\\". Shaggy (tied up in the film reel) is then thrown out of the studio and he chases the Mystery Machine into the sunset, realizing that he too, belongs on his old show.

Machinist and Sasson (1983) call them \\"personified weapons\\". The Sibitti call on Erra to lead the destruction of mankind. Išum tries to mollify Erra's wakened violence, to no avail. Foreign peoples invade Babylonia, but are struck down by plague. Even Marduk, the patron of Babylon, relinquishes his throne to Erra for a time. Tablets II and III are occupied with a debate between Erra and Išum. Erra goes to battle in Babylon, Sippar, Uruk, Dūr-Kurigalzu and Dēr. The world is turned upside down: righteous and unrighteous are killed alike. Erra orders Išum to complete the work by defeating Babylon's enemies. Then the god withdraws to his own seat in Emeslam with the terrifying Seven, and mankind is saved. A propitiatory prayer ends the work. The poem must have been central to Babylonian culture: at least thirty-six copies have been recovered from five first-millennium sites—Assur, Babylon, Nineveh, Sultantepe and UrThe provenance of some Erra tablets is not securely known. (Machinist and Sasson 1983:221 note 2).—more, even, as the assyriologist and historian of religions Luigi Giovanni Cagni points out, than have been recovered of the Epic of Gilgamesh.L. Cagni, '\\"The Poem of Erra\\" SANE 1.3 (1977). The text appears to some readers to be a mythologisation of historic turmoil in Mesopotamia, though scholars disagree as to the historic events that inspired the poem: the poet exclaims (tablet IV:3) \\"You changed out of your divinity and made yourself like a man.\\" The Erra text soon assumed magical functionsBurkert, Walter.

WLIB is owned by Emmis Communications, along with sister stations WBLS (107.5 FM) and WQHT (97.1 FM). The three stations share studios in the Hudson Square neighborhood of lower Manhattan, and WLIB's transmitter is located in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. History The station's origins reach back to December 1941, when WCNW went on the air from Brooklyn. Sharing time with WWRL on 1600kHz, WCNW was granted permission to move down the dial to 1190 kHz. WCNW, which broadcast foreign language programs, was purchased by Elias Godofsky, who was the General Manager of the station, in 1942. It was Godofsky who would change the call letters to the present WLIB. The station's target audience was upper middle-class and wealthy New Yorkers, as evidenced by its format of classical music and popular standards which competed with WQXR.WLIB advertisement. Broadcasting Yearbook, 1945, page 133 The station was purchased by New York Post publisher Dorothy Schiff in 1944 and regularly ran news updates from the Post 's newsroom at various times during the day. In 1949 WLIB was purchased by the New Broadcasting Company. The firm was headed by former WNYC executive Morris S. Novik and his brother, garment executive Harry Novik. Upon taking control of the station the Novik brothers turned WLIB into a station which served ethnic audiences, with large amounts of programming targeting the city's Jewish and African American communities. The station eventually became the leading voice of New York's black residents and established a presence in the community's epicenter with studios at \\"Harlem Radio Center\\" in the Hotel Theresa in Harlem. During the mid-to-late 1950s its airstaff included pioneering black radio disc jockey Hal Jackson, actor William Marshall (of Blacula fame) and Victor Bozeman, who would later become a Los Angeles-based staff announcer for NBC television.WLIB advertisement. Broadcasting Yearbook, 1957, page 174 Journalists Bill McCrearyBill McCreary Speakers International and Gil Noble also got their start in WLIB's news department, before each made the leap to television in the mid-1960s. In the 1960s WLIB was one of several commercial jazz stations in New York. Among its disc jockeys was Billy Taylor, whose shows were not only great listening but an education. According to him, \\"With the help Del Shields and Ed Williams [we] built the biggest jazz audience in New York.\\" During much of this period WLIB's primary competition came from WWRL, another station which programmed to Black audiences. WLIB became black-owned in the 1970s after activists picketed the station and demanded African Americans be given a chance to purchase it. Many felt the station's series of white owners didn't care about broadcasting with community concerns in mind. Percy Sutton, Malcolm X’s former attorney and then-Manhattan borough president, formed the Inner City Broadcasting Corporation (ICBC) with the backing of a group of black investors (including Hal Jackson and Billy Taylor, who was installed as WLIB's general manager), and purchased WLIB from the Novik brothers in 1972.\\"Black group to buy WLIB (AM) New York.\\" Broadcasting, July 19, 1971, pg. 61.\\"Changing Hands.\\" Broadcasting, July 3, 1972, pg. 23 The station's first talk shows featured Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, and Dr. Carlos Russell, a noted former college professor who taught some of the Black and Latino students who later founded the Young Lords. =Increased signal power= The station's nighttime power was increased to 30,000 watts in the early 2000s, in a swap with WOWO in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which also broadcasts on 1190 AM. Prior to the power increase WLIB operated during daytime hours (sunrise to sunset) only, deferring at night to WOWO's 50,000-watt clear-channel signal. Inner City Broadcasting purchased the Fort Wayne station in 1994 for the sole purpose of lowering its power in order to increase WLIB's, setting the stage for WLIB to eventually begin broadcasting around the clock. After gaining Federal Communications Commission approval for 24-hour broadcasting, it would still be a few years before WLIB would actually begin nighttime programming. In the meantime Inner City sold WOWO, whose nighttime signal is now greatly reduced. =Politics= Since becoming black-owned the station has broadcast political, Afrocentric, and health-centered programming aimed at New York's Caribbean American community. WLIB's advocacy strength was credited with getting out the vote for David Dinkins in 1989 as he ran to become New York City's first black mayor. former WLIB logo, as an Air America Radio affiliate In 2004, the station affiliated with Air America Radio due to a lack of advertiser support and ratings during its daytime hours. The switch was controversial, with many in the community seeing the switch as replacing black activist programming with Air America's primarily white, liberal on-air personalities.Air America Will Displace Black Talk On WLIB Air America programming, which featured shows hosted by Al Franken, Randi Rhodes and Rachel Maddow, aired most of the day over WLIB with the exception of overnights, when the station returned to its urban talk roots with the Global Black Experience, hosted by Imhotep Gary Byrd. Starting in 2005, the apolitical Satellite Sisters aired instead of the Mike Malloy show on WLIB from 10 p.m. to midnight on weeknights. Air America programming left WLIB after August 31, 2006; the network moved to WWRL the next day. It was rumored that the Progressive talk radio format would be retained using local hosts and syndicated talker Ed Schultz, under a lease agreement with Randy Michaels' company, Radioactive, LLC.Media Week However negotiations fell through, and on August 21, 2006 WLIB announced that they would switch to a gospel music format, after considering country music, oldies, Spanish oldies, rock, classic dance, smooth jazz and even urban talk from Radio One. =Sale to Emmis= Following Inner City Broadcasting's bankruptcy in 2012, WLIB and WBLS (and Inner City's other station properties) were acquired by YMF Media LLC, owned jointly by investor Ronald Burkle and basketball legend Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson. Over the next two years YMF sold off all of Inner City's stations; on February 11, 2014, Emmis Communications announced it its purchase of WLIB and WBLS for $131 million. Emmis began operating the stations under a local marketing agreement until receiving final approval from the FCC, which came on June 10, 2014.

When the pre-existing Turkish ghazis were incorporated into the Ottoman Empire's military they became known as \\"akıncı.\\" They were one of the first divisions to face the opposing military and were known for their prowess in battle. Unpaid they lived and operated as raiders on the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire. There is a distinction made between \\"akıncı\\" and \\"deli\\" cavalry. History In battle their main role was to act as advance troops on the front lines and demoralise the marching opposing army by using guerrilla tactics, and to put them in a state of confusion and shock.George F. Nafziger and Mark W. Walton. Islam at War: A History. p. 95. They could be likened to a scythe in a wheat field. They would basically hit the enemy with arrows. When attacked in melee, they would retreat while still shooting backwards. They could easily outrun heavy cavalry because they were lightly armed and their horses were bred for speed as opposed to strength. Akinji forces carried swords, lances, shields and battle axes as well, so that in a field of combat, they could face the enemy first and fight melee. In some Ottoman campaigns, such as the Battle of Krbava field, Akinji forces were the only units utilized without any need for Ottoman heavy cavalry or infantry. Because of their mobility akinji were also used for reconnaissance and as a vanguard force to terrorize the local population before the advance of the main Ottoman forces. Since they were irregular militia, they were not bound by peace treaties, so they could raid border villages and attack enemy garrisons, fortresses and border posts during peacetime, constantly harassing the enemy and checking the weak spots on the rival country's defences. They would also attack trading routes to cut enemy's supply and transportation. Akinji forces were led by certain families. Well-known akinji families were Malkoçoğlu, Turhanlı, Ömerli, Evrenosoğlu, and Mihalli. These akinji clans were mainly composed of Turkmen tribal warriors with a leading dynasty which descended from the warrior ghazis of the first Ottoman ruler Osman I. Adventurers, soldiers of fortune, mercenaries, warrior dervishes, and civilians looking for fortune and adventure would also join the ranks of akinji gangs. Since akinjis were seen as irregular militia, they did not have regular salaries as kapikulu soldiers, or fiefs like timarli soldiers; their only income was the booty that they captured. Akinjis used to wear colourful and interesting clothes to shock and confuse their opponents. They used to wear eagle wings on their backs (this tradition was imitated by Polish light cavalry troops later), put on helmets with bull horns, wear coats made of leopard skin. As a result of their unusual appearance and their almost suicidally courageous battle tactics, akinjis were nicknamed by the public as \\"deliler\\" (the crazies), and \\"serdengeçtiler\\" (headgivers: meaning \\"the one who has already given his head to enemy\\", a man who does not care if he lived or died). Akinji system had an important role at the establishment of the empire and fast expansion of Ottoman territories in Europe. Though the akinji system worked excellently from the 14th to 16th centuries, it began to decline after the 16th century. Starting with 16th-17th century nomadic Tatar and Nogay cavalry from the Crimean Khanate also served as akinjis for the Ottoman Empire. After the Ottoman advance in Europe stopped, akinji warriors became unnecessary and without the economy of booty this warrior class slowly faded away. After the modernization of the Ottoman army, the last few officially recognized akinji clans were abolished. Still, last remnants of akinji system existed till late 19th century in the Balkan provinces as the bashi-bozouk (irregular) warriors. Although the terminology differentiating between similar types of Ottoman cavalry corps is not fully clarified, the akinji, once decimated in the battle of Giurgiu in October 1595 as they were retreating over the Danube, was apparently gradually replaced by new irregular corps, such as the \\"deli\\" and \\"bashi-bozouk\\".  In literature  Akinji lifestyle with battles was a romantic fantasy for the public and so akinjis were a popular subject in Ottoman folk literature and music. \\"Serhad türküleri\\" or \\"border folk songs\\" is a subcategory of Ottoman folk music dealing mostly with akinji raids and battles or love affairs of akinji warriors, sometimes odes to fallen warriors. Alişimin Kaşları Kara\\" (My Aliş had Black Eyebrows), \\"Estergon Kalesi\\" (Castle of Esztergom) are some of the most popular examples. In the modern period, romantic-revivalist Turkish writers also wrote poems about akinjis. Yahya Kemal's \\"Akıncılar\\" is one of the most well-known example on this subject.

The accounts of her vary greatly from source to source. Skuld is derived from the Old Norse verb skulla, \\"need/ought to be/shall be\\"; its meaning is \\"that which should become, or that needs to occur\\". Other similarly named characters appear in the Skjöldunga saga and the Gesta Danorum, as well as the Chronicon Lethrense.  Hrólfs saga kraka  Hrólfs saga kraka tells that one Yule, Helgi (appears as Halga in Beowulf) was visited by an ugly being while he was in his hunting house. No person in the entire kingdom allowed the being to enter the house, except Helgi. Later, the thing asked to sleep in his bed. Unwillingly he agreed, and as the thing got into the bed, it turned into a dark elvish woman, who was clad in silk and who was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He raped her, and made her pregnant. Helgi forgot the woman and a couple of days after the date had passed, he was visited by the woman, who had Skuld on her arms. The daughter would marry Hjörvarđr (Heoroweard). Much later, when her half-brother Hrólfr Kraki was King of the Danes, Skuld began to turn her husband against Hrólfr. Under the pretext that they would wait three years before paying the accumulated tribute at one time, Skuld assembled a large army which included strong warriors, criminals, elves and norns. She was a great sorceress and used seiðr (witchcraft) to hide the great muster from Hrólfr and his champions. They then arrived at Lejre one Yule for the midwinter blóts, with all the weapons hidden in wagons to ambush the king at night. A battle ensued and, in the account found in Gesta Danorum, Bödvar Bjarki fought in the shape of a spirit bear until he was awakened by Hjalti. To overcome him, Skuld cast the most powerful spell to resuscitate her fallen warriors and after a long fight Hrólfr and all his eleven champions fell, with the sole exception of Vöggr who promises to avenge the king. As Hjörvarđr was also killed in the battle, Skuld became the Queen of Denmark but did not rule well and only for a short time. Bödvar Bjarki's brothers Elk-Froði and Thorir (Þorir) Houndsfoot went to Denmark to avenge their brother. The Swedish queen Yrsa gave them a large Swedish army headed by Vöggr. They seized the wicked elf queen by surprise, just as she had suddenly attacked the king, tying her arms so she could not use her magic arts. With no spells to prevent it, they then slew all of her supernatural rabble. After this, a vengeance was exacted on Skuld in retribution for her treachery and fratricide, as she was tortured to death through a variety of the most dreadful ways. The rule over the kingdom was then restored to King Hrólfr's daughters. When all this was accomplished, everyone went home.Jesse L. Byock, The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki, 1998.Gwyn Jones, Eirik the Red and Other Icelandic Sagas, 1990.George Norman Garmonsway, Jacqueline Simpson, Hilda Roderick Ellis Davidson, Beowulf and Its Analogues, 1971.Gabriel Turville-Petre, The Heroic Age of Scandinavia, 1951. Skjöldunga saga The Skjöldunga saga relates that Helgo (Halga) was the King of Denmark together with his brother Roas (Hroðgar). Helgo raped Olava, the Queen of the Saxons, and she bore a daughter named Yrsa. The girl later married King Adillus (Eadgils), the King of Sweden. Yrsa and Adillus had a daughter, Scullda. Yrsa and Adillus married their Scullda to Hiørvardus, the King of Öland (also called Hiorvardus and Hevardus, and who corresponds to Heoroweard in Beowulf). As her half-brother Rolfo (Hrólfr Kraki, Hroðulf) was not consulted about this marriage, he was infuriated and he attacked Öland and made Hiørvardus and his kingdom tributary to Denmark. Hiørvardus and Queen Skullda rebelled against Rolfo and killed him. However, Hiørvardus did not live long after this and was himself killed. Gesta Danorum The Gesta Danorum tells that Roluo (Hrólfr Kraki) defeated Athislus (Eadgils) and gave Sweden to a young man named Hiartuar (Heoroweard), who was seized by passion to Roluo's beautiful but heartless sister Skulde and married her. The ambitious Skulde, however, did not like the fact that her husband had to pay taxes to Roluo and so incited Hiartuar to rebel against him. Hiartuar went to Lejre (a town which Roluo had built) with arms hidden in the ships, under the pretense that he wanted to pay tribute. They were well-received, but after the banquet, when most people were drunk asleep, the Swedes and the Goths (i.e. the Geats) proceeded to kill everyone at Roluo's residence. After a long battle, involving Roluo's champion Bjarki, who fought in the shape of a spirit bear until he was awakened by his comrade Hjalti, the Geats won and Roluo was killed. Hiartuar asked Wigg (Vöggr) if he wanted to fight for him, and Wigg said yes. Hiartuar wanted to give Wigg a sword, but he insisted on receiving it by taking the hilt. Having the hilt in his hand, Wigg pierced Hiartuar with the sword and thus avenged Roluo. Swedes and Geats then rushed forward and killed Wigg. The Swedish king Høtherus (based on the god Höðr), the brother of Athislus, succeeded Roluo and became the king of a combined Sweden and Denmark. Chronicon Lethrense and Annales Lundenses The Chronicon Lethrense (and the included Annales Lundenses) tell that Rolf Krage's sister Skulda was married against Rolf's will to Hartwar/HiarwarthHartwar according to the Chronicon Lethrense, but Hiarwarth according to the Annales Lundenses. (Heoroweard), a German earl of Skåne, but reputedly Rolf had given Skulda to him together with Sweden. Hjartwar arrived in Zealand with a large army and said that he wanted to give his tribute to Rolf, but killed the sleeping Rolf together with all his berserkers after these intoxicated themselves at a banquet Rolf had given in honor of his sister's arrival. Only one survived, Wigge (Vöggr), who played along until he was to do homage to Hjartwar. Then, he pierced Hartwar with a sword, and so Hjartwar was only king one morning. However, according to a reputation, it was instead an Åke who killed Hjartwar with seven dagger-stabs and so became king.Paul Christian Sinding, History of Scandinavia, 1860.

The chin-up (also known as a chin or chinup) is a strength training exercise. People frequently do this exercise with the intention of strengthening muscles such as the latissimus dorsi and biceps, which extend the shoulder and flex the elbow, respectively. In this maneuver, the palms are faced towards the body. It is a form of pull- up in which the range of motion is established in relation to a person's chin. In the 1970s and 1980s, the term chin-up not only included an overhand/pronated (\\"palms away\\") grip, but some authors used it as the default meaning of the term, with an underhand/supinated (\\"palms toward\\") grip called a \\"reverse\\" grip. (paper edition, ISBN changes to 0-668-05625-8 for cloth edition) 2 photographs depicting an overhand (palms forward, pronated) grip and captions: page 99 \\"Here Clare Furr shows impressively wide lats in her chin-ups.\\" page 132 \\"James DeMelo does an intense set of chin-ups\\" Even in the 2010s \\"chin-up\\" still includes palms-away lifting. The term \\"chin-up\\" is still regularly used to refer to pulling using an overhand-grip. Etymology A chin-up is named by bringing the chin up through space, specifically in relation to its position with the bar or other hand grips. This can be either touching the bar (more easily done by extending the neck, though that could be considered cheating) or by bringing the chin over the bar. This exercise is easier for males than females because of the male tendency to have stronger and larger biceps and a higher centre of gravity. This is usually achieved most easily with vertical forearms that are close to the body. For most, bringing the chin this high is most easily achieved with a supinated (underhanded, palms-toward) grip. Due to this, the phrase \\"chin-up\\" has become associated with pulling with this type of grip. Some have delegated the term pull-up to refer to the pronated (overhanded, palms-away) grip. In spite of this, many refer to pull-ups with a pronated grip also as chin-ups, and the supine grip is still regularly called a pull-up. Some organizations such as the American Council on Exercise have adopted this new terminology, issuing statements such as: \\"a chin-up differs from a pull-up in that the puller's hands are facing towards him or her in a chin-up, and away in a pull-up.\\" Organizations such as the United States Marine Corps, however, use the term pull-up interchangeably to refer to both the overhand and underhand grips. Form A chin-up has a variety of different forms.exrx.net defines Chin-Up. The movement begins with the arms extended above the head, gripping a hold. It may be fixed, such as a chin-up bar or moving, such as gymnastic rings or rotating handles. The body is pulled up, with the bar approaching or touching the upper chest. A chin-up is considered complete based on a variety of criteria in relation to where the chin should be in respect to the bar, or in respect to the hand grips. The body is then lowered until the arms are straight but not in a lockout, and the exercise is generally repeated. Like any pull-up, chin-ups can be performed with a kip, where the legs and back flop around to aid the exercise, or from a dead hang, where the body is kept still. Performing the chin-up correctly can be tricky with a supinated grip, because of the natural tendency to do most of the work with the elbow flexors (largely biceps) rather than the shoulder extensors (largely lats). Initiating the pulling action with scapular depression may help avoid this problem. The exercise is most effective in stretching the working muscles when the body is lowered down to a full extension. Muscles targeted Chin-ups, like most pull-ups, target the latissimus dorsi muscle of the back as a shoulder extensor, scapular downward rotator and scapular depressor, in bringing the spine to the humerus. This is assisted by elbow flexors (brachialis, brachioradialis, biceps brachii) which bring the humerus to the forearm. Chin- ups, unlike pull-ups, also highly target the biceps. That is one of the main differences between pull-ups and chin-ups. The lat's functions are also assisted, both by shoulder extensors (teres major, posterior deltoid, infraspinatus, teres minor), scapular downward rotators (rhomboids, levator scapulae), and scapular depressors (lower trapezius and pectoralis muscles). Pulling higher with a narrow grip puts the focus on extension rather than adduction of the shoulder. If one leans back at the top of the movement, the focus is shifted somewhat towards scapular retraction and hyperextension. The weight of the legs and pelvis are borne by spinal ligaments and various muscles that flex or extend the spine. If the pelvis is tilted anterior and the legs brought behind, the erector spinae (with aid from the lats) bears more weight. If the pelvis is tilted posterior and the legs brought in front, the rectus abdominis (with aid from the psoas) bears more. Variations *Sternal chin-ups (also called sternum chins) — this variant employs a fuller range of motion at the top, raising beyond the chin and touching the sternum to the bar. The elbows are nearly directly below the shoulders this way. This requires adequate scapular depression. If leaning back (arching the spine) a sternum-up can be done that is not a chin-up, this shifts to requiring scapular retraction. Gironda-sternum-chins-2.png Gironda-sternum-chins-1.png *Weighted chin-ups — weight is added dangling from a dipping belt or via weighted belt or vest, ankle weights, chains, medicine ball between the knees, dumbbell between the feet or kettlebells on top of the feet. *One-arm chin-ups — one hand grips the bar and the other hand does not assist *One-hand chin-ups — One hand grips the bar while the other arm assists by grabbing the forearm of the arm hanging onto the bar. These require far less strength than a one- arm chin-up. *Spine chin-ups — in the supine position, the arms are held perpendicular to the body as the grip the bar; instead of the chin, the chest is pulled towards the bar. This exercise is performed in the horizontal (transverse) plane, whereas other chin-up variations are performed in the vertical (coronal) plane. As a result, this variation recruits the trapezius and teres major muscles much more than a vertical chin-up would, and is more commonly known as the supine row. Advanced versions popular amongst gymnasts are performed completely off the ground in some type of front lever. *Harrison chin-ups — a term coined by powerlifter Dan Harrison, this technique is similar to a normal chin-up but with an arched spine to more effectively target the latissimus dorsi and take strain off the biceps. Though it has become a recent phenomenon on the West Coast of the United States (especially with beach-goers), it has not yet gained widespread popularity. Training and performance Specific training is needed in order to increase chin-ups performance. The performance can be measured in various ways: *number of repetitions without touching the floor *number of repetitions in a specified time interval (1/3/30 minutes, 1/6/12/24 hours) *number of repetitions with a total weight (body weight plus additional weight) Various organizations like Guinness World Records maintain lists of world records for chin-ups and pull- ups. Both recordholders.org and Guinness World Records maintain that pull-ups use a pronated grip, while chin-ups use a supinated grip.  Chin-ups in fitness assessments  The chin-up exercise is used by uniformed services around the world to assess the physical fitness of its members. In order to be accepted into and remain in a particular service, a candidate may need to carry out a certain number of chin-ups to a prescribed technique. This number may vary with age and gender. *for US Rangers, the Ranger Physical Fitness Test requires candidates to complete at least six chin-ups in two minutes. * for the United States Secret Service, candidates are required to execute chin- ups with their arms fully extended in the downwards phase. No time limit is required. To achieve a 'fair' rating, male candidates need to complete seven chin-ups (if aged from 20 to 29), six (30 to 39), four (40 to 49) or two (over 50). Female candidates, irrespective of age, need to complete two chin-ups. * Australian navy clearance divers and special forces are required to complete six chin-ups (or 'heaves').http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/mobile/recruitment- centre/how-to-join/fitness-test.aspx * Canadian parachutists are required to demonstrate at least seven chin- ups.https://www.cfmws.com/en/AboutUs/PSP/DFIT/Fitness/Correspondence/Documents/Parachutist/PARACHUTIST%20PHYSICAL%20FITNESS%20TEST.pdf  Chin-up bars  right Chin-up bars are playground equipment that were once ubiquitous on children's playgrounds. They are still important in the adult equivalent of a playground, the Par course. A chin-up bar is simply a smooth horizontal metal bar, often a pipe, held solidly above ground by a wooden or metal frame. Typical installations include 2 or 3 different heights of bars for people of different heights. Chin up bars are also a part of a home gym setup. Types of chin-up bars include doorway-mounted, wall-mounted, ceiling- mounted and free-standing.

It is located on Ashe Avenue and is adjacent to the Main and Centennial campuses of North Carolina State University, covering an area between Western Boulevard and historic Hillsborough Street. Founded in 1887, Pullen Park is the oldest public park in North Carolina. The park features picnic areas, a concessions stand along with several small rides including the Pullen Park Carousel, train, and kiddie boats. Pedal boats are also available for rent seasonally on the park's small lake. The Pullen Aquatic Center, Pullen Arts Center and Theatre in the Park are also located on the park grounds. It is one of the most famous and well-known parks in the Research Triangle region. The East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida, runs through Pullen Park. paddle boatsPullen Park's Lake Howell History Pullen Park was founded on March 22, 1887 when Richard Stanhope Pullen donated farmland to the City of Raleigh expressly to be used as a space for recreational enjoyment of its citizens and visitors. This land became Pullen Park, the first public park in North Carolina, although its founder, always shying from thanks and publicity, opposed giving it his name. A \\"Committee on Public Parks\\" was formed to oversee the transformation from farmland to landscaped park and a Park Keeper was hired in 1888 to oversee these modifications. Pullen continued his own involvement by taking part in the planning and financing of bridges, roads and paths throughout the park as well as the planting of trees and general landscaping in the park and the neighboring NC State University which was built on land also donated by him. Pullen's landscape design was in keeping with the times. He also financed a round pavilion for outdoor entertainment and a fountain, located near the city's first swimming pool (for men only) in 1891. A congressman from another county donated fifty Japanese carp for the fountain which shows the significance of the park even outside of Raleigh. In 1895 modifications to the structure and regulations of the pool allowed for its use by women. The pool remained in the same place until it was replaced by the Pullen Aquatic Center in 1992 (see: Aquatic Center). In addition to the many attractions in the park today, there was also a small zoo on site from 1899 to 1938. The park's original steam-powered merry-go-round was replaced by the current carousel in 1921. The zoo was created following a national trend to incorporate zoological parks in public parks which began in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century. Beginning with only two raccoons, the collection soon grew in size and variety and by 1903 included an Australian owl, mink, bears, alligators and monkeys and many other species. The zoo eventually closed, most likely due to the death of the Park Keeper, Wiley Howell, who had maintained the zoo and is the namesake for the park's Lake Howell. The original merry-go-round was purchased for $350 in 1914 from the W.D. Chase Bottling Works of Galesburg, Illinois. It began operating in 1915 but apparently it was in poor condition because the city decided to purchase a replacement Dentzel carousel only five years later. (see: Carousel) Although baseball was unofficially played in Pullen Park for many years – perhaps even before the land became a park - the officially sanctioned field was not created until the unofficial field was renovated in 1920. A second field was added later. In 2000 the city began making plans to update the park to accommodate Raleigh's growing population and later invited the citizens to take part in the plans. Over the past several years many changes have been made, including the removal of an iconic 'Swiss cheese' play structure and other playground equipment. More notable, however, is the new entrance and additional parking that make the park more accessible to more people. Although Jim Crow laws during that era prohibited African-Americans from using some of the park's facilities (e.g. the swimming pool), the park's main areas were open to everyone, and African-Americans in the community were not denied access to the park overall. According to the census of the National Amusement Park Historical Association, Pullen Park is the 14th oldest amusement park in the world. The park was closed from December 14, 2009 to November 18, 2011 for extensive renovations including a new, climate-controlled carousel house, welcome center, concessions building, restroom facilities, and train station. Site improvements include a new entrance, event spaces, playground, underground utilities and picnic shelters. Additionally, Lake Howell was drained and dredged for regular lake maintenance and to allow for updates including a new boat dock and apron and the installation of a geothermal energy system. Founder Richard Stanhope Pullen was born on September 18, 1822 to Turner and Elizabeth Smith Pullen on a small family farm in Wake County, NC. Little is known about his early life and education, and even in his later life he shied from the press and recognition. However, it is known that as a young man he began working for his uncle, Richard Smith, in Raleigh. Eventually Pullen inherited quite a large sum of money from his uncle and began embarking on developing Raleigh through business endeavors as well as philanthropic projects. His land and monetary donations contributed to the development of city roads, and what later became Peace College, UNC Greensboro, NC State University, Edenton Street United Methodist Church and, of course, Pullen Park. He remained actively involved in planning and funding improvements to the park until his death in 1895. No monument or plaque was erected on park ground commemorating his contributions until 1992, as the city feared that this use would violate the clause that stipulated that the land must be used for recreational purposes. The most recognizable monument to Richard Stanhope Pullen for Raleigh residents is the obelisk on the Pullen family plot in Raleigh's Oakwood Cemetery. In addition, Pullen Hall at NC State University was named in his honor. Attractions In addition to several swing sets, sand areas and other various playground equipment for children of all ages, the park also features lighted tennis courts, two ball fields, a lake with paddle boats, covered and uncovered picnic areas, many picturesque paths and bridges, the Aquatic Center, Arts Center and Theatre in the Park. The Aquatic Center and Arts Center both offer classes to all ages in physical fitness, swimming and arts and crafts (pottery, jewelry making, weaving, glass art, etc.) Plays are performed on a regular basis at the internationally acclaimed Theatre in the Park. =Pullen Aquatic Center= Pullen Aquatic Center, completed in 1992, is one of four city-run, public year-round aquatic centers in Raleigh. It features an Olympic size swimming pool, a warm water therapy pool, a mezzanine with spectator seating, an outdoor patio, and locker room facilities. The center is open for swimming laps as well as recreational swimming and offers water exercise programs, aquatic therapy programs, a city swim league, and American Red Cross Learn-to- Swim lessons, lifeguard training, and instructor-level classes. The Aquatic Center is also used for several local, state, and regional swimming and diving competitions each year, including the Special Olympics of the annual State Games of North Carolina which are held in May/June. It is located on Ashe Avenue adjacent to Pullen Park. =Pullen Arts Center= Pullen Arts Center offers classes in pottery, jewelry-making, painting, printmaking, weaving, and glass arts. The center has extensive studios and equipment, as well as instructors and knowledgeable staff to help both the accomplished artist and the novice. The Arts Center also hosts a summer camp program called Art4Fun for children, and special events and gallery exhibits are held throughout the year. =Theatre in the Park= Theatre in the Park was originally chartered in 1947. The name was changed in the early 1970s. This air conditioned indoor theatre facility, located in the northern end of the park, includes a beautiful Season Member Lounge, administrative offices, costume shop, technical workshop, dressing rooms, lobby and a flexible 'black box' performance space. Year-round programming includes no less than four mainstage productions, classes, workshops and independent productions. The theatre is internationally acclaimed and well known locally for Ira David Wood III's musical comedy adaption of Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" an ongoing annual production since 1974. =Andy Griffith Statue= Although monuments and statues have traditionally been avoided due to the clause that stipulates that the land must only be used for recreational purposes, in 2003, the cable television network TV Land permanently loaned a statue of Andy and Opie Taylor depicting a well known scene from The Andy Griffith Show. The addition of this statue was controversial, as citizens of Mount Airy, North Carolina, which the fictional town of Mayberry was ostensibly based on, believed that the statue should be in their town as opposed to Raleigh. The statue has been vandalized several times and its plaque stolen. The statue was slightly redesigned to prevent further damage. A second statue of Andy and Opie was later erected in Mount Airy outside the Andy Griffith museum. =Red Caboose= A real Norfolk Southern Railway 380 bay window red caboose with a Southern Railway paint scheme is displayed in the park for children to explore. Red Caboose Rides The park features four rides with a nominal charge for each. Tickets are purchased from the office near the park entrance. Adults are welcome on all rides with the exception of the kiddie boats. =Kiddie Boats= The kiddie boats, which are intended only for small children, circle in a small pool at a leisurely pace. =Paddle Boats= Lake Howell's Pedalos are available for rental by the half hour. There must be one person aged 16 or older aboard, and the paddle boats can accommodate up to four people each. Life jackets are available. =Miniature Train= Carousel house after 2011 renovations A miniature train, added to the park in 1950, goes through a tunnel and around the park. The tunnel and a second train were added in 1971. The C.P. Huntington Train is a narrow gauge, one-third sized operational miniature train that has thrilled children of all ages since it was added to the park. The engine is a near exact replica of a locomotive that was built in 1863 at the Danforth-Cook Locomotive works in Paterson, New Jersey which eventually found its way to San Francisco (by way of Cape Horn) when it was purchased by Central Pacific Railroad where C.P. Huntington was then Vice President. On April 9, 1864, it was christened the C.P. Huntington C.P. #3 after its first run. The locomotive was slated to be destroyed in 1914 but was saved, restored and renamed, and it now resides in Sacramento, CA. =Carousel= Carousel animals The Pullen Park Carousel was made circa 1912 by master carver Salvatore Cernigliaro of the Dentzel Carousel Company of Germantown, Pennsylvania. It contains 52 hand-carved basswood animals, 2 chariots (or sleighs), 18 large gilded mirrors and 18 canvas panels and a Wurlitzer 125 organ made in 1924 by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of North Tonawanda, New York. The Dentzel Carousel Company was the first American carousel company and while thousands of carousels were made in the U.S., there are only approximately 200 antique carousels left today. Fewer than 25 of those are Dentzel carousels, and only 14 of those remain in operation. Unfortunately, the carousel is often closed for repairs — a small price to pay to continue to be able to enjoy this beautiful antique ride when it is in good working condition. Many generations of park visitors have enjoyed riding a giraffe, pony or ostrich on the carousel as a child and continue to pass that tradition along to their own children. The carousel is considered to be the park's most popular attraction. This particular carousel was originally located in Bloomsbury Park (also in Raleigh near what is now known as Five Points) and was moved to Pullen Park in 1921 when the Raleigh City Board (now City Council) voted to replace the park's original steam powered antique merry-go- round. Bloomsbury Park, an amusement park founded by Carolina Power & Light (CP&L;), was apparently in financial trouble and Pullen Park was able to acquire the carousel for only $1,425 — one tenth of its original cost. Despite the bargain purchase, this city expenditure angered many Raleigh residents at the time but they soon acquiesced after the new carousel began operation. Carousel Wurlitzer The current carousel underwent major restoration from 1977 to 1982, during which time the original factory paint was uncovered, documented and conserved. It was the first time such a restoration attempt had been made. Each hard carved animal was restored to its exact Munsell Color System paint color, preserving the original paint underneath a layer of shellac while enabling the animals to look just as they were originally painted (#sign). In 1976 the carousel was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and it is also a designated Raleigh Historic Landmark.National Register of Historical Places - NORTH CAROLINA (NC), Wake County References External links *Pullen Park (Official Website) Category:Parks in Raleigh, North Carolina Category:Urban public parks ","title":"Pullen Park"},{"id":"2608730","text":"Memorial to the victims of SS Daphne, Craigton Cemetery SS Daphne was a ship which sank moments after her launching at the shipyard of Alexander Stephen and Sons in Govan, Glasgow, Scotland, on 3 July 1883.  Background  Around 200 workmen were on board the ship at the time it was launched, ready to begin fitting out work as soon as she was properly afloat. According to the usual practice during a launching, anchors were attached by cable to each side of the ship. As the Daphne moved into the river, the anchors failed to stop the ship's forward progress. The starboard anchor moved only 6 to 7 yards (5.5 to 6.4 meters), but the port anchor was dragged 60 yards (55 meters). The current of the river caught Daphne and flipped her over onto her port side, sinking her in deep water. 124 people died including many young boys. 70 lives were saved. It took more than a fortnight for the bodies of those who died to be recovered.  Inquiry  An inquiry was held afterward; the shipyard owners were held blameless, which led to claims of a cover-up. The cause of the disaster was reported to be little initial stability combined with too much loose gear and too many people on board. One of the outcomes of the disaster was the limiting of personnel aboard to only those necessary for mooring the ship after the launch. The Daphne was later raised, repaired, and renamed the Rose. Memorials The principal memorial to the Daphne is in Craigton Cemetery where around 50 of the victims are buried. It was designed by William Robin and erected in 1885.

He is best known for his work on twin studies and lie detection. Life Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, David Lykken was the youngest of seven children born to Henry G. Lykken and his wife Frances. He joined the United States Navy at 17 and then attended University of Minnesota on the G.I. Bill, earning his bachelor of arts (psychology, philosophy and mathematics) 1949, his master's degree in psychology and statistics in 1952, and his doctorate in clinical psychology and neuropsychiatry in 1955. He remained on Minnesota’s permanent faculty for his entire career and taught as a visiting professor at Deep Springs College. He was an emeritus professor from 1998 until his death. Lykken's wife, wildlife advocate Harriet (Betts) Lykken, died in 2005. Lykken was survived by three sons: attorney Matthew Lykken, physicist Joseph Lykken, and criminologist Jesse Lykken, as well as ten grandchildren. Work Lykken was also known for his work on twins, which he began in 1970. He was a principal investigator on the Minnesota Twin Family Study, which examines heritability of certain psychological traits based on evidence found in identical and fraternal twins. He was a signatory of a collective statement in response to The Bell Curve titled \\"Mainstream Science on Intelligence\\", written by Intelligence editor Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal in 1994 and in Intelligence in 1997.Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). Mainstream Science on Intelligence. Wall Street Journal, p A18. Lykken was the proponent of a set- point theory of happiness, which argues that variation in sense of well-being is half determined by genetics and half determined by circumstances, and has been the subject of international media attention.Lykken, David. The Heritability of Happiness. Harvard Mental Health Letter. His research findings suggest that variation in baseline levels of cheerfulness, contentment, and psychological satisfaction is largely a matter of heredity. He was also a proponent of introducing a scheme whereby every parent or prospective parent would have to obtain a license in order to have a legal baby, which would depend on the parents being married, financially independent, having no criminal record or debilitating illness, and not being assessed as high in psychopathy or sociopathy.Richard Lynn: Eugenics: a reassessment Praeger, Westport, Conn, 2001, Chapter 14, He was elected a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (Division 1), a Charter Fellow of the American Psychological Society and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also a member of the Behavior Genetics Association and the International Society for Twin Research. Throughout his career, he consulted with government and industry. He frequently testified as an expert witness on polygraph testing and personality assessment in the wake of Daubert standard requirements. Funding Some of Lykken's work was funded by the Pioneer fund, an organization often criticized as promoting scientific racism. Lykken defended his acceptance of money from the fund, writing \\"If you can find me some rich villains that want to contribute to my research—Qaddafi, the Mafia, whoever—the worse they are, the better I'll like it. I'm doing a social good by taking their money... Any money of theirs that I spend in a legitimate and honorable way, they can't spend in a dishonorable way\\".Patricia Ohman (7 March 1984). \\"Do they get what they Pay for?\\", Minneapolis City Pages, p. 8. Nevertheless, he has praised the theories of eugenic academics associated with or on the board of the pioneer fund, such as Richard Lynn.Lykken, D. (2004). The New Eugenics.

Plot After Alice Holbrook (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a happily married English woman living in Bristol, receives an anonymous Valentine's Day card with radish seeds in it, she automatically assumes the card is from her supposedly loving lawyer husband, Sam (Jimi Mistry), and that he is trying to be romantic. In return, Alice decides to write an anonymous reply to her husband to keep the gimmick going, but only accidentally sends the card after a drunken night with her sister. What Alice does not realise, however, is that her husband did, in fact, not send her the original Valentine's Day card; her husband's best friend and lawyer partner, Archie (Dougray Scott), did. When Alice's husband does not mention that he has received her card, Alice becomes suspicious that he is cheating on her with another woman. In an attempt to discover the truth, Alice calls her husband and pretends to be another woman with a deep, sultry voice who she calls \\"Anonymous.\\" After her husband agrees to meet with \\"Anonymous,\\" Alice becomes even more distraught, but continues to try and win her husband back. However, in the process, she discovers her husband Sam is already having another affair with a woman named Katya and is now knowingly starting a second affair with \\"Anonymous.\\" After breaking down over this fact, she goes to visit Archie in the sexy outfit she planned to woo Sam back with, and while Archie and she kiss, he assumes she is having an extra-marital affair with someone other than Sam and refuses to be a part of it. Alice decides to forge ahead with her \\"affair\\" with Sam as \\"Anonymous,\\" and while having supposedly extramarital sex with him, she removes his wedding ring from his finger with her lips. Afterwards, however, Sam declares \\"Alice is nothing compared to [Anonymous]\\" and that he has never truly loved Alice, and so she becomes very upset and flees the hotel. When she is running away, however, she runs into Katya, who discovers that Sam is not only cheating on his wife but also on her. While Sam does win his big court case next, he returns home to find his precious wine scattered throughout the neighborhood and his clothes thrown in the street (all done by Alice), as well as Katya waiting at his house to tell Alice of their affair as revenge. When Katya sees Alice, however, she calls her \\"Anonymous,\\" and so Sam realizes that Alice has been \\"Anonymous\\" all the while. Alice even shows Sam how she removed the ring from his finger to prove it. While Sam attempt to plead with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Alice insists on a divorce and Katya walks out on Sam as well. The film then fast forwards to a little time later. Katya took her story as well as that of \\"Anonymous\\" to the press and so Sam's reputation as an upstanding lawyer has been ruined. Furthermore, the press exposes that Alice was, in fact, not having an extramarital affair as Archie previously thought. This realisation prompts Archie to attempt to tell Alice about his feelings for her, but she cannot see past their friendship. Because of this, Archie decides he cannot get over Alice while still in Bristol, so he takes a job in Japan. First though, he sends a goodbye letter to Alice, in which he includes \\"P.S. I hope you liked the radishes,\\" finally letting her know that the original Valentine's Day card was from him and not Sam. Alice chases after Archie and finally catches him after a series of debacles at the train station, including him having to actually stop the train. They kiss and declare they love each other. The movie ends when Alice lovingly looks up at the man who really thinks she is \\"the perfect woman\\" and says \\"Take me home and radish me.\\" Main cast * Jennifer Love Hewitt - Alice Holbrook * Dougray Scott - Archie Gray * Jimi Mistry - Sam Holbrook * Branka Katić - Katya * Kate Miles - Felicity * Stefan Dennis - Dougie * Simon Webbe - Dan Harlow References The Truth About Love.

He spent 11 years touring on the World Championship Tour as a professional surfer. Dorian quit competition surfing in 2003 to focus on big waves. He is currently a big wave surfer and one of the best in the world at big wave riding. Early life Dorian was born to Patrick, a former Hollywood actor and stunt double for Elvis Presley, and Susan, who competed in female bodybuilding events. When Shane was three, his parents opened a restaurant called \\"Dorian's\\" on the beach. Being a child, Dorian was too young to wait tables, and long hours at the restaurant resulted in him turning to the ocean for amusement. Dorian attended Konawaena High School in Kealakekua, Hawaii. =Personal life= Dorian lives in Holualoa, Hawaii with his wife Lisa and his son. He enjoys taking care of an orchard that consists of 110 fruit trees at an elevation of 4000 feet above sea level.http://www.billabong.com/asia/team-rider/surf/14/shane-dorian =Surfing career= Dorian started out on a bodyboard alongside friend, and future bodyboarder champion, Mike Stewart. Dorian received his first surfboard, from his dad, on his fifth birthday. He soon abandoned the bodyboard to focus on surfing. Surfing and surfing education became a priority for Dorian. Shane's mother, who had divorced Shane's father Patrick when Shane was 12, worked out a system where Shane would spend the second and third quarters of the school year on the North Shore of Oahu (the peak winter season) and the first and fourth quarters back home on the Big Island. In 1987, Dorian had his first major success at the Gotcha Pro competition at Sandy Beach. He was able to beat some big names, made it through four rounds, and received some media exposure. He became friends with a couple of the up-and-coming surfers on Oahu, Brock Little and Todd Chesser who played a role in the development of his surfing. Since 1995, Dorian has directed the Shane Dorian Keiki Classic for surfers 17 and under. Dorian has been a long-time member of the Billabong U.S. surf team, his main sponsor. World Championship Tour Dorian joined the ASP World Tour in 1993, where he hovered outside of the top 10 for a number of years before cracking the barrier with a fourth-place world finish in 2000. He has also won a number of events in his career, including the Rip Curl Pro in 1999 and the 2000 Billabong Pro at Mundaka. In 2004, Dorian retired from the WTC tour, but not from a being a professional; choosing to focus on becoming a better surfer. After retirement, Dorian started to concentrate on big wave surfing, mainly towing into big waves via jet ski, which was the norm then. However, over the years, he and his fellow big wave surfers have preferred paddling into big waves. Dorian took the top prize at the 2008 Global Big Wave awards in California.http://encyclopediaofsurfing.com/entries/dorian-shane In 2011, Dorian was awarded \\"Ride of the Year\\" by the World Surf League for paddling into a giant Peahi \\"Jaws\\" barrel on 3-15-2011 estimated to be 57 feet tall by the World Surf League, and biggest wave ever paddled into at that time.http://www.xgames.com/xgames/gallery/9233282/image/3/shane-dorian Surfing statistics *2001 – 2nd Place - Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau big-wave contest (Waimea Bay, Oahu) *2000 – 4th ranked overall on World Championship Tour (WCT) *2000 – 1st Place - Billabong Pro (France/Spain) *1999 – 1st Place - Rip Curl Pro (Australia) *1998 – 2nd Place - Rip Curl World Cup (WQS-Hawaii), Billabong Challenge (Specialty-Australia) *1996 – 1st Place - O'Neill Surf Challenge (WQS-France) *1994 – 1st Place - Nescau Surf Energy (World Qualification Series: WQS-Brazil) Awards *2016 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Surfline Best Overall Performance *2016 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Billabong Ride of the Year for his big wave ride on Jaws in Peahi, Hawaii *2015 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Surfline Best Overall Performance *2015 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Billabong Ride of the Year for his big wave ride on Puerto Escondido, (Mexico) *2013 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Billabong XXL Ride of the Year and Pacifico Tube - May 3, 2013 for his big wave ride on Jaws/Peahi (Peahi, Hawaii) *2012 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Waterman of the Year by the Surf Industry Manufacturers' Association *2011 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Billabong XXL Monster Paddle Award - March 15, 2011 for his big wave ride on Jaws in Peahi, Hawaii *2011 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Billabong XXL Monster Tube - March 15, 2011 for his tube-ride in Maui, Hawaii *2010 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Billabong XXL Men's Overall Performance Award *2006 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Billabong XXL Monster Tube Award – September 11, 2005 for his big wave ride in Teahupoo, Tahiti *2005 – WSL Big Wave Awards: Billabong XXL (Global Big Wave Awards) Surfline/Jay Moriarity Best Overall Performance Award *2000 – 2nd Place - Surfer Magazine Readers Poll Awards (runner-up to his friend and fellow professional surfer Kelly Slater) Filmography * In God's Hands (1998), with Surfers Matt George and Matty Liu * Thicker Than Water (2000) a surf film by Jack Johnson and the Malloys. * The Blueprint (2005) * Solid: The Two Days That Teahupoo Blew Minds (2005) * Campaign 2 (2005) * A Fly in the Champagne (2009) * Momentum Generation (2018) In the documentary Solid: The Two Days That Teahupoo Blew Minds, fellow surfers gave him a standing ovation for his wave conquering rides. =Television= Dorian is featured in an ESPN on ABC television series three-part special called World of X-Games: Big Wave Hellmen that premiered on October 26, 2014 and ran until November 9, 2014.

Invention In December 2010, Dorian had a terrifying wipeout at Mavericks in a two-wave hold-down that almost killed him. The incident motivated Shane to design surfing's first \\"safety suit\\" to be inflated with a CO2 cartridge in a wetsuit vest during a potentially deadly hold-down.

It is situated between the suburbs of Epsom (north) and Onehunga (south). Royal Oak is under the local governance of the Auckland Council. History It is named after the Royal Oak hotel that was located on the Royal Oak Roundabout. In 1909 the hotel lost its licence to sell alcohol. For many years it was a pharmacy before being used as the premises of Barfoot & Thompson Real Estate Agency. Royal Oak refers to the tree Charles II hid up during the Battle of Worcester to avoid capture. In the middle of the Royal Oak Roundabout was once located the Seddon Memorial. Designed by John Park, a local architect who was also mayor of Onehunga on two occasions, the structure was erected in memory of Prime Minister Seddon who died suddenly in office in 1906. Richard John Seddon (1845–1906) was immensely popular and there are several monuments to him around the country. The Royal Oak Monument was in the form of a Gothic Market Cross and was a combined tram shelter, gas lamp standard and drinking fountain. By the middle of the 20th century it was decided that the memorial was an obstruction to traffic and it was removed during September and October 1947.Streets and Works Committee minutes, Onehunga Borough Council records, OHB 106/3; Onehunga Borough Council minutes, OHB 100/23; R.

Royal Oak Mall was expanded significantly in the 1980s to become a significant source of commerce in the area. An aerial view of the Royal Oak intersection taken in May 1947. The Seddon Memorial is visible in the centre. =Boyd Zoo= Royal Oak was once home to Boyd Zoo, one of the earliest Zoological Garden in New Zealand. It was opened in 1912 by local businessman (and future mayor of Onehunga) John James Boyd. It held 600 to 2000 specimens including several lions, bears, wolves, flamingos, and other exotic animals. Most of the animals were kept in relatively poor conditions. There was an abattoir on site where local stray animals such as horses and cats were slaughtered to be fed to the captive animals. There is an often repeated tale of a lion escaping from the zoo and wandering around the streets of Onehunga, however this story is somewhat erroneous and misleading. The first appearance of the story was in a community newspaper in 1966. The most probable origin of the story was a lion cub which had gotten into a paddock of cows with calves around the Christmas of 1917. Rather than a wild lion roaming the streets, the small cub was backed into a corner of the paddock by the herd until it was lassoed and returned to its enclosure. Although the zoo was popular with visitors, the noise and smell made it very unpopular with the locals. Boyd was engaged in a constant battle with the local council over the running of the zoo. Eventually, after several attempts to sell his animals to the council, the council finally reached an agreement with Boyd: 11 lions, 6 bears, and 2 wolves were sold to the council for £800. The animals were given to the newly established Auckland Zoo at Western Springs in 1922. Drone photograph showing Royal Oak Roundabout The Boyd Zoo site was later built on as a temporary hospital for American Marines in 1942, before being converted into Manukau Intermediate School (now renamed as Royal Oak Intermediate School). Demographics Royal Oak, comprising the statistical areas of Royal Oak West (Auckland) and Royal Oak East (Auckland), had a population of 5,334 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 417 people (8.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 603 people (12.7%) since the 2006 census.

The book is a frame narrative primarily depicting a fictional island society and its religious, social, and political customs. Many aspects of More's description of Utopia are reminiscent of life in monasteries.  Title  The title De optimo rei publicae statu deque nova insula Utopia literally translates, \\"Of a republic's best state and of the new island Utopia\\". It is variously rendered as any of the following: * On the Best State of a Republic and on the New Island of Utopia * Concerning the Highest State of the Republic and the New Island Utopia * On the Best State of a Commonwealth and on the New Island of Utopia * Concerning the Best Condition of the Commonwealth and the New Island of Utopia * On the Best Kind of a Republic and About the New Island of Utopia * About the Best State of a Commonwealth and the New Island of Utopia The original name was even longer: Libellus vere aureus, nec minus salutaris quam festivus, de optimo rei publicae statu deque nova insula Utopia. This translates, \\"A truly golden little book, no less beneficial than entertaining, of a republic's best state and of the new island Utopia\\". \\"Utopia\\" is derived from the Greek prefix \\"ou-\\" (), meaning \\"not\\", and topos (), \\"place\\", with the suffix -iā () that is typical of toponyms; the name literally means \\"nowhere\\", emphasizing its fictionality. In early modern English, Utopia was spelled \\"Utopie\\", which is today rendered Utopy in some editions. In English, Utopia is pronounced exactly as Eutopia (the latter word, in Greek [Eutopiā], meaning “good place,” contains the prefix [eu-], \\"good\\", with which the of Utopia has come to be confused in the English pronunciation). This is something that More himself addresses in an addendum to his book Wherfore not Utopie, but rather rightely my name is Eutopie, a place of felicitie.More’s Utopia: The English Translation thereof by Raphe Robynson. second edition, 1556, in \\"Eutopism\\". \\"Felicitie\\" means \\"happiness\\" (see http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=felicity)  Contents  = Preliminary matter = The first edition contained a woodcut map of the island of Utopia, the Utopian alphabet, verses by Pieter Gillis, Gerard Geldenhouwer, and Cornelius Grapheus, and Thomas More's epistle dedicating the work to Gillis. = Book 1: Dialogue of Counsel = A woodcut by Ambrosius Holbein, illustrating a 1518 edition. In the lower left, Raphael describes the island Utopia. The work begins with written correspondence between Thomas More and several people he had met in Europe: Peter Gilles, town clerk of Antwerp, and Hieronymus van Busleyden, counselor to Charles V. More chose these letters, which are communications between actual people, to further the plausibility of his fictional land. In the same spirit, these letters also include a specimen of the Utopian alphabet and its poetry. The letters also explain the lack of widespread travel to Utopia; during the first mention of the land, someone had coughed during announcement of the exact longitude and latitude. The first book tells of the traveller Raphael Hythlodaeus, to whom More is introduced in Antwerp, and it also explores the subject of how best to counsel a prince, a popular topic at the time. The first discussions with Raphael allow him to discuss some of the modern ills affecting Europe such as the tendency of kings to start wars and the subsequent loss of money on fruitless endeavours. He also criticises the use of execution to punish theft, saying thieves might as well murder whom they rob, to remove witnesses, if the punishment is going to be the same. He lays most of the problems of theft on the practice of enclosure—the enclosing of common land—and the subsequent poverty and starvation of people who are denied access to land because of sheep farming. More tries to convince Raphael that he could find a good job in a royal court, advising monarchs, but Raphael says that his views are too radical and would not be listened to. Raphael sees himself in the tradition of Plato: he knows that for good governance, kings must act philosophically. He, however, points out that: More seems to contemplate the duty of philosophers to work around and in real situations and, for the sake of political expediency, work within flawed systems to make them better, rather than hoping to start again from first principles. = Book 2: Discourse on Utopia = Utopia is placed in the New World and More links Raphael's travels in with Amerigo Vespucci's real life voyages of discovery. He suggests that Raphael is one of the 24 men Vespucci, in his Four Voyages of 1507, says he left for six months at Cabo Frio, Brazil. Raphael then travels farther and finds the island of Utopia, where he spends five years observing the customs of the natives. According to More, the island of Utopia is The island was originally a peninsula but a 15-mile wide channel was dug by the community's founder King Utopos to separate it from the mainland. The island contains 54 cities. Each city is divided into four equal parts. The capital city, Amaurot, is located directly in the middle of the crescent island. Each city has not more than 6000 households, each family consisting of between 10 and 16 adults. Thirty households are grouped together and elect a Syphograntus (whom More says is now called a phylarchus). Every ten Syphogranti have an elected Traniborus (more recently called a protophylarchus) ruling over them. The 200 Syphogranti of a city elect a Prince in a secret ballot. The Prince stays for life unless he is deposed or removed for suspicion of tyranny. People are re-distributed around the households and towns to keep numbers even. If the island suffers from overpopulation, colonies are set up on the mainland. Alternatively, the natives of the mainland are invited to be part of these Utopian colonies, but if they dislike them and no longer wish to stay they may return. In the case of under-population the colonists are re-called. There is no private property on Utopia, with goods being stored in warehouses and people requesting what they need. There are also no locks on the doors of the houses, and the houses are rotated between the citizens every ten years. Agriculture provides the most important occupation on the island. Every person is taught it and must live in the countryside, farming for two years at a time, with women doing the same work as men. Parallel to this, every citizen must learn at least one of the other essential trades: weaving (mainly done by the women), carpentry, metalsmithing and masonry. There is deliberate simplicity about these trades; for instance, all people wear the same types of simple clothes and there are no dressmakers making fine apparel. All able-bodied citizens must work; thus unemployment is eradicated, and the length of the working day can be minimized: the people only have to work six hours a day (although many willingly work for longer). More does allow scholars in his society to become the ruling officials or priests, people picked during their primary education for their ability to learn. All other citizens, however, are encouraged to apply themselves to learning in their leisure time. Slavery is a feature of Utopian life and it is reported that every household has two slaves. The slaves are either from other countries (prisoners of war, people condemned to die, or poor people) or are the Utopian criminals. These criminals are weighed down with chains made out of gold. The gold is part of the community wealth of the country, and fettering criminals with it or using it for shameful things like chamber pots gives the citizens a healthy dislike of it. It also makes it difficult to steal as it is in plain view. The wealth, though, is of little importance and is only good for buying commodities from foreign nations or bribing these nations to fight each other. Slaves are periodically released for good behaviour. Jewels are worn by children, who finally give them up as they mature. Other significant innovations of Utopia include: a welfare state with free hospitals, euthanasia permissible by the state, priests being allowed to marry, divorce permitted, premarital sex punished by a lifetime of enforced celibacy and adultery being punished by enslavement. Meals are taken in community dining halls and the job of feeding the population is given to a different household in turn. Although all are fed the same, Raphael explains that the old and the administrators are given the best of the food. Travel on the island is only permitted with an internal passport and any people found without a passport are, on a first occasion, returned in disgrace, but after a second offence they are placed in slavery. In addition, there are no lawyers and the law is made deliberately simple, as all should understand it and not leave people in any doubt of what is right and wrong. There are several religions on the island: moon-worshipers, sun-worshipers, planet-worshipers, ancestor-worshipers and monotheists, but each is tolerant of the others. Only atheists are despised (but allowed) in Utopia, as they are seen as representing a danger to the state: since they do not believe in any punishment or reward after this life, they have no reason to share the communistic life of Utopia, and will break the laws for their own gain. They are not banished, but are encouraged to talk out their erroneous beliefs with the priests until they are convinced of their error. Raphael says that through his teachings Christianity was beginning to take hold in Utopia. The toleration of all other religious ideas is enshrined in a universal prayer all the Utopians recite. Wives are subject to their husbands and husbands are subject to their wives although women are restricted to conducting household tasks for the most part. Only few widowed women become priests. While all are trained in military arts, women confess their sins to their husbands once a month. Gambling, hunting, makeup and astrology are all discouraged in Utopia. The role allocated to women in Utopia might, however, have been seen as being more liberal from a contemporary point of view. Utopians do not like to engage in war. If they feel countries friendly to them have been wronged, they will send military aid, but they try to capture, rather than kill, enemies. They are upset if they achieve victory through bloodshed. The main purpose of war is to achieve that which, if they had achieved already, they would not have gone to war over. Privacy is not regarded as freedom in Utopia; taverns, ale- houses and places for private gatherings are non-existent for the effect of keeping all men in full view, so that they are obliged to behave well. Framework The story is written from the perspective of More himself. This was common at the time, and More uses his own name and background to create the narrator.Baker-Smith, Dominic. \\"Thomas More.\\" The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spring 2014 Edition, Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/thomas-more/. The book is written in two parts: “Book one: Dialogue of Council,” and “Book two: Discourse on Utopia.” The first book is told from the perspective of More, the narrator, who is introduced by his friend Peter Giles to a fellow traveller named Raphael Hythloday, whose name translates as “expert of nonsense” in Greek. In an amical dialogue with More and Giles, Hythloday expresses strong criticism of then-modern practices in England and other Catholicism-dominated countries, such as the crime of theft being punishable by death, and the over-willingness of kings to start wars (Getty, 321). Book two has Hythloday tell his interlocutors about Utopia, where he has lived for five years, with the aim of convincing them about its superior state of affairs. Utopia turns out to be a socialist state. Interpretations about this important part of the book vary. Gilbert notes that while some experts believe that More supports socialism, others believe that he shows how socialism is impractical. The former would argue that More used book two to show how socialism would work in practice. Individual cities are run by privately elected princes and families are made up of ten to sixteen adults living in a single household. It is unknown if More truly believed in socialism, or if he printed Utopia as a way to show that true socialism was impractical (Gilbert). More printed many writings involving socialism, some seemingly in defense of the practices, and others seemingly scathing satires against it. Some scholars believe that More uses this structure to show the perspective of something as an idea against something put into practice. Hythloday describes the city as perfect and ideal. He believes the society thrives and is perfect. As such, he is used to represent the more fanatic socialists and radical reformists of his day. When More arrives he describes the social and cultural norms put into practice, citing a city thriving and idealistic. While some believe this is More's ideal society, some believe the book's title, which translates to “Nowhere” from Greek, is a way to describe that the practices used in Utopia are impractical and could not be used in a modern world successfully (Gilbert). Either way, Utopia has become one of the most talked about works both in defense of socialism and against it.  Interpretation  One of the most troublesome questions about Utopia is Thomas More's reason for writing it. Most scholars see it as a comment on or criticism of 16th-century Catholicism, for the evils of More's day are laid out in Book I and in many ways apparently solved in Book II. Indeed, Utopia has many of the characteristics of satire, and there are many jokes and satirical asides such as how honest people are in Europe, but these are usually contrasted with the simple, uncomplicated society of the Utopians. Yet, the puzzle is that some of the practices and institutions of the Utopians, such as the ease of divorce, euthanasia and both married priests and female priests, seem to be polar opposites of More's beliefs and the teachings of the Catholic Church of which he was a devout member.Huddleston, Gilbert. \\"St. Thomas More.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 Sept. 2018 www.newadvent.org/cathen/14689c.htm. Another often cited apparent contradiction is that of the religious tolerance of Utopia contrasted with his persecution of Protestants as Lord Chancellor. Similarly, the criticism of lawyers comes from a writer who, as Lord Chancellor, was arguably the most influential lawyer in England. It can be answered, however, that as a pagan society Utopians had the best ethics that could be reached through reason alone, or that More changed from his early life to his later when he was Lord Chancellor. One highly influential interpretation of Utopia is that of intellectual historian Quentin Skinner. He has argued that More was taking part in the Renaissance humanist debate over true nobility, and that he was writing to prove the perfect commonwealth could not occur with private property. Crucially, Skinner sees Raphael Hythlodaeus as embodying the Platonic view that philosophers should not get involved in politics, while the character of More embodies the more pragmatic Ciceronian view. Thus the society Raphael proposes is the ideal More would want. But without communism, which he saw no possibility of occurring, it was wiser to take a more pragmatic view. Quentin Skinner's interpretation of Utopia is consistent with the speculation that Stephen Greenblatt made in The Swerve: How the World Became Modern. There, Greenblatt argued that More was under the Epicurean influence of Lucretius's On the Nature of Things and the people that live in Utopia were an example of how pleasure has become their guiding principle of life. Although Greenblatt acknowledged that More's insistence on the existence of an afterlife and punishment for people holding contrary views were inconsistent with the essentially materialist view of Epicureanism, Greenblatt contended that it was the minimum conditions for what the pious More would have considered as necessary to live a happy life. Another complication comes from the Greek meanings of the names of people and places in the work. Apart from Utopia, meaning \\"Noplace,\\" several other lands are mentioned: Achora meaning \\"Nolandia\\", Polyleritae meaning \\"Muchnonsense\\", Macarenses meaning \\"Happiland,\\" and the river Anydrus meaning \\"Nowater\\". Raphael's last name, Hythlodaeus means \\"dispenser of nonsense\\" surely implying that the whole of the Utopian text is 'nonsense'. Additionally the Latin rendering of More's name, Morus, is similar to the word for a fool in Greek (μωρός). It is unclear whether More is simply being ironic, an in-joke for those who know Greek, seeing as the place he is talking about does not actually exist or whether there is actually a sense of distancing of Hythlodaeus' and the More's (\\"Morus\\") views in the text from his own. The name Raphael, though, may have been chosen by More to remind his readers of the archangel Raphael who is mentioned in the Book of Tobit (3:17; 5:4, 16; 6:11, 14, 16, 18; also in chs. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12). In that book the angel guides Tobias and later cures his father of his blindness. While Hythlodaeus may suggest his words are not to be trusted, Raphael meaning (in Hebrew) \\"God has healed\\" suggests that Raphael may be opening the eyes of the reader to what is true. The suggestion that More may have agreed with the views of Raphael is given weight by the way he dressed; with \\"his cloak... hanging carelessly about him\\"; a style which Roger Ascham reports that More himself was wont to adopt. Furthermore, more recent criticism has questioned the reliability of both Gile's annotations and the character of \\"More\\" in the text itself. Claims that the book only subverts Utopia and Hythlodaeus are possibly oversimplistic.  Reception  Utopia was begun while More was an envoy in the Low Country in May 1515. More started by writing the introduction and the description of the society which would become the second half of the work and on his return to England he wrote the \\"dialogue of counsel\\", completing the work in 1516. In the same year, it was printed in Leuven under Erasmus's editorship and after revisions by More it was printed in Basel in November 1518. It was not until 1551, sixteen years after More's execution, that it was first published in England as an English translation by Ralph Robinson. Gilbert Burnet's translation of 1684 is probably the most commonly cited version. The work seems to have been popular, if misunderstood: the introduction of More's Epigrams of 1518 mentions a man who did not regard More as a good writer. The title of the book has since eclipsed More's original story and the term is now commonly used to describe an idyllic, imaginary society. Although he may not have directly founded the contemporary notion of what has since become known as Utopian and dystopian fiction, More certainly popularised the idea of imagined parallel realities, and some of the early works which owe a debt to Utopia must include The City of the Sun by Tommaso Campanella, Description of the Republic of Christianopolis by Johannes Valentinus Andreae, New Atlantis by Francis Bacon and Candide by Voltaire. The politics of Utopia have been seen as influential to the ideas of Anabaptism and communism. While utopian socialism was used to describe the first concepts of socialism, later Marxist theorists tended to see the ideas as too simplistic and not grounded on realistic principles. The religious message in the work and its uncertain, possibly satiric, tone has also alienated some theorists from the work. An applied example of More's Utopia can be seen in Vasco de Quiroga's implemented society in Michoacán, Mexico, which was directly inspired by More's work. During the opening scene in the film A Man for all Seasons, Utopia is referenced in a conversation. The alleged amorality of England's priests is compared to that of the more highly principled behaviour of the fictional priests in More's Utopia, when a character observes wryly that \\"every second person born in England is fathered by a priest.\\"  Cultural impact  In 1998, the film Ever After: A Cinderella Story made references to the work in multiple scenes. In 2006, artist Rory Macbeth inscribed all 40,000 words on the side of an old electricity factory in Norwich, England. In 2019, the video game Final Fantasy XIV made significant reference to the work in its expansion \\"Shadowbringers\\".  Further reading  * More, Thomas (1516/1967), \\"Utopia\\", trans. John P.

Early life Rachele Mussolini was born Rachele Guidi in Predappio, Romagna, Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia). She was born into a peasant family and was the daughter of Agostino Guidi and wife Anna Lombardi. After the death of her father, her mother became the lover of the widowed Alessandro Mussolini. Relationship, marriage and children In 1910, Rachele Guidi moved in with Alessandro's son, Benito Mussolini. In 1914, Mussolini married his first wife, Ida Dalser. Though the records of that marriage were destroyed by Mussolini's government, an edict from the city of Milan ordering Mussolini to make maintenance payments to \\"his wife Ida Dalser\\" and their child was overlooked. Shortly before his son, Benito Albino Mussolini, was born to Ida Dalser, Rachele Guidi and Benito Mussolini were married in a civil ceremony in Treviglio, Lombardy on 17 December 1915. In 1925, they renewed their vows in a religious service (after his rise to power). Rachele Mussolini bore five children by Benito Mussolini, and she was willing to ignore his various mistresses. Rachele and Benito Mussolini had two daughters, Edda (1910–1995) and Anna Maria (1929–1968), and three sons Vittorio (1916–1997), Bruno (1918–1941), and Romano (1927–2006). During husband's regime During the reign of Mussolini's Fascist regime, Rachele Mussolini was portrayed as the model Fascist housewife and mother. She remained loyal to Mussolini until the end but, on 28 April 1945, was not with him when he and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, were captured and executed by Italian partisans. Although she tried to flee from Italy after World War II, she was arrested in April 1945 in Como, close to Switzerland, by Italian partisans. She was turned over to the US Army and kept on Ischia Island but was released after several months. Final years In her later life, Rachele Mussolini ran a restaurant in her native village of Predappio, where she served pasta dishes. She eventually received a pension from the Italian Republic in 1975. It turned out that Mussolini had not received a salary from the state and so she could not receive a pension.

Life and career Edwin White studied in Paris, Düsseldorf, Rome, and Florence and later taught at the National Academy of Design, in New York. In addition to his studies under several different American and European painting masters, he also attended lectures at a Medical College in New York City to study anatomy. He also attended Amherst; where he received an A.M. by the end of 1856.Art and Artiest of Connecticut, H. W. French, 1879. Works by White, mostly in storage, are in the collections of Yale; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; New-York Historical Society. A notable moment in White's career was noted in October, 1855, when he met the painter Sanford Robinson Gifford in Paris and told Gifford that he was about to return to New York, was destitute, had no commissions, and might have to return to portrait painting. However, when White did return to his New York studio, he went to work on his Mayflower painting, which he sold off the easel for $1,000, and a new and successful stage of his career was launched.

He is known as a translator of Aristotle. He was wounded during the Sack of Rome in May 1527, and died later that year. His origins are unknown; his eloquence was praised in Erasmus' letter to John Watson in 1516, the earliest surviving notice. After having studied Greek in Venice under Marcus Musurus of Candia, he was employed for some time as a proofreader by the printer Aldus Manutius. Alcionio published at Venice, in 1521, a Latin translation of several of the works of Aristotle (dedicating the volume to Leo X). The Spanish scholar Sepúlveda, when shown the work, found it to contain many mistakes. In 1522 Alcionio was appointed professor of Greek at Florence through the influence of Giulio de' Medici. That year he entrusted to the Aldine publish a dialogue in the nature of a eulogy on the theme of exile (Medices legatus, sive de exsilio), in a Ciceronian Latin so finely honed that he was charged with plagiarism by his personal enemy, Paulus Manutius. The accusation was that he had taken the finest passages in the work from Cicero's lost treatise De Gloria and had then destroyed the only existing copy of the original to escape detection. The 18th century scholar Abate Girolamo Tiraboschi in his Storia della letterature italiana demonstrated this to be groundless, but the smear has dogged the reputation of Alciono. When his patron became pope the following year under the title of Clement VII, Alcionio followed him to Rome and remained there until his death. Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) remarked that \\"His contemporaries speak very unfavourably of Alcionio, and accuse him of haughtiness, uncouth manners, vanity and licentiousness.\\" Alcionio is one of the four humanists in the circle of Clement VII selected by Kenneth Gouwens to illustrate the shock of cultural discontinuity and new sense of human vulnerability caused by the Sack of Rome that put a premature end to the High Renaissance. Of Alcionio's numerous translations of Greek classics into Latin, which included the orations of Isocrates and Demosthenes mentioned by Ambrogio Leoni, only his Aristotle has survived (Simon Finch).

The oldest of the Three Cities is Birgu, which has existed since prior to the Middle Ages. The other two cities, Senglea and Cospicua, were both founded by the Order of Saint John in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Three Cities are enclosed by the Cottonera Lines, along with several other fortifications. The term Cottonera is synonymous with the Three Cities, although it is sometimes taken to also include the nearby town of Kalkara. Together, the Three Cities have a total population of 10,808 people as of March 2014. History Birgu has been settled since the time of the Phoenicians, but the current city dates back from the time of the Order of Saint John. Birgu was chosen as the capital city of Malta instead of Mdina upon the arrival of the Order in 1530. After the 1551 attack, Senglea was built on the peninsula known as L'Isola. In Birgu, Fort Saint Angelo was built on the site of the ancient Castrum Maris, and Fort Saint Michael was built on Senglea. The cities were besieged during the Great Siege of Malta of 1565, and after the siege was lifted Birgu was given the title of Città Vittoriosa and Senglea the title of Città Invicta. In the aftermath of the siege, the city of Valletta was built, and in 1571 the new city became the capital instead of Birgu. The cities' fortifications were strengthened during the reign of Grandmaster Nicolas Cotoner, and in 1722, Grandmaster Marc'Antonio Zondadari gave the town of Bormla the title of Città Cospicua. The Cottonera lines or rather Civitas Cotonera was intended as a city surrounded by fortifications. These impressive fortifications were built according to the plan of Antonio Maurizio Valperga on four of the five hills of Bormla. Originally intended as a much larger defense system which would encompass the Corradino hill and extend over Kalkara to Ricasoli, the final plan intended for the Citta Cottonera to be a city with the fort St. Margerita as a citadel at its centre. The beginning to construction began on 28 August 1670 with great solemnity as follows: 'On that day a general procession of all the regular orders walked from the Parish Church of Burmula, led by the prior of the convent church, who held the famous relic of St. John, glorious protector of the Holy Religion followed by the Grand Master, all the knights and a lot of citizens walked towards the hill, where the bastion of S. Niccolo was planned; here and there, with the usual ceremonies, and blessings, the Grand Master Fra Nicola Cotoner cast various coins bearing his and the city’s mark within the foundations of the wall, as also did the Knights of the Grand Cross while they invoked the Divine help. The foundation stone was laid with the firing of the guns of all the fortresses.' The six kilometre fortification encircles Bormla with a series of bastions and triumphal baroque gateways. A detail from the cartouche by Albert Clouet of the Civitas Cotonera, shows a central castle or fort; the Fort Santa Margerita surrounded by the present day Cottonera lines with new buildings, palaces and gardens with the Dockyard Creek and most importantly, it shows Bormla forming an essential part of Civitas Cotonera. These areas in Bormla within Clouet's cartouche were and are still spread over 3 areas in present-day Bormla; the lower Santa Margerita area, the Verdala/St. Helen's area and the Dock No. 1/St.Paul's area. Albert Clouet's cartouche excludes the peninsulas of the two neighbouring cities, so it is quite evident that neither Birgu (Vittoriosa) nor Isla (Senglea) were ever intended to form part of Civitas Cotonera. With the death of Grand Master Cotoner critics of the design discontinued work claiming that it would not withstand a siege. Numerous people of note have affirmed this claim and have even gone as far as to say that the Cottonera lines are not siege proven. The blockade by the British and the Maltese uprising against the French who had to defend their position by locking themselves within the Cottonera lines for well over a year should be sufficient proof that these claims are spurious. With the discontinuation of work on the Civitas Cotonera, the Fort St. Margarita continued with different redesigns by various Grand Masters to its present appearance as a line of bastions. It is safe to say that by the 1670, the fortifications of Birgu(Vittoriosa) and Isla(Senglea) were grossly outdated so the building of the Cottonera fortifications during the reign of Grandmaster Nicolas Cotoner were intended to protect the harbour and Valletta from the landward side against possible attacks by the Ottomans landing at Marsaxlokk. Bormla's ancient name of Burmula has been defined as Phoenician or Punic which indicates this city's ancient origins. In his book Notizie Storiche Sull' Etimologia Dei Nomi, Achille Ferris explains that ‘Burmula’ is made up of the words ‘Bur’ and ‘Mula’; ‘Bur’ for ‘place’ and ‘Mula’ for ‘high’; an eminent place. Bormla’s domination in height over the surrounding areas tends to corroborate this version. In the book Della lingua punica presentemente usata da maltesi &c;, Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis refers to the t'Ghuxa area in Bormla and the ancient name of Burmula itself as proof that these have Punic origins. The meaning of these words in themselves indicate that Burmula was regarded as an eminent place that stands out - a conspicuous place hence the term 'Cospicua' is as ancient as the name 'Burmula' because it is a direct translation of the site's Phoenician name. It is said that in 1722 on seeing the Bormla's eminence and double line of fortifications that surround it, Grand Master Marc'Antonio Zondadari, honoured the town by proclaiming it as a city, hence the term: Città Cospicua - The Conspicuous City. During World War II, the Three Cities were heavily bombed by the Italians and Germans, and they were rebuilt in the 1950s and 1960s. Many people from the educated and professional classes moved out of the Cottonera area after the war, and the cities were subsequently repopulated by people from the working class. The area subsequently had higher levels of illiteracy, unemployment and people on welfare when compared to the rest of Malta. Since the 1990s, several regeneration projects have been carried out, including the establishment of the Malta Maritime Museum in Birgu and the American University of Malta in Cospicua.

Founded in 1854a short history of the Mechanics' Institute of San Francisco by Taryn Edwards to serve the vocational needs of out-of-work gold miners, the institute today serves readers, writers, downtown employees, students, film lovers, chess players, and others. Library Though initially a library dedicated to the mechanical arts, in 1906, the institution merged with the Mercantile Library Association, and dropped its technical focus. Its collection today covers all subjects, with special strengths in literature, arts, history, philosophy, business, finance, and hard-to-find periodicals. The Mechanics' Institute also has a rapidly growing audio-book, e-book, and music collection. The Institute encourages members to recommend materials for purchase, attend workshops, and participate in literature and film discussions groups. Currently, five book discussion groups talk about a variety of genres, and three writers’ groups offer peer-to-peer support and advice. Events The Mechanics' Institute Events department presents over fifty author events a year. These offer a broad spectrum of authors and themes, including fiction and non-fiction, with an emphasis on American and world history, arts and architecture, biography, science and technology, social trends, economy, and culinary arts. Special Programs, such as the San Francisco Noir Literary Night, World Poetry Reading, Bloomsday, and a Bastille Day celebration are popular annual events. The CinemaLit Film Series presents 35 films a year, featuring classic American, retro and foreign films. The evening begins with introductions by prominent film critics, writers, and reviewers, with a discussion after each film. CinemaLit draws an eclectic, diverse audience with many film buffs dedicated to the Friday night film salon. Author events, CinemaLit and Special Programs are open to members and the public. Free attendance at most events and CinemaLit are a benefit of membership. Chess The Mechanics' Institute building houses the oldest continuously operating chess club in the United States. Many world champions have visited the chess room, from Emanuel Lasker in 1902 to Boris Spassky in 2006. In 2009 one of the chess club's young students, 12-year-old Daniel Naroditsky, won the World Championship for his age group. The chess club offers tournaments and other activities for all player levels. Membership Membership in the Mechanics' Institute is open to the public. Each membership offers the full services of the library and chess room, and free admittance or discounts to special events, lectures, book discussion groups, classes, and other activities. History In 1848, the discovery of gold lured people from all over the world to California. By 1853 most surface gold was mined out, pushing the town of San Francisco into economic decline. A flood of former miners had no jobs, skills, or prospects. The Mechanics' Institute began in 1854, with four books, a chess room, and a mission to start a vocational school. At this time, California had no colleges or universities, and no public libraries. (The San Francisco Public Library did not open until 1879.) Within a few years, the Mechanics' Institute offered classes in such subjects as woodworking, mechanical drawing, industrial design, electrical science, applied mathematics, and ironwork. The institute's importance in California technical education reached a pinnacle in 1868, when the California legislature granted a charter for the establishment of the University of California. The institute participated in the fledgling university's first years, hosting technical classes and presenting lectures on many topics. It helped develop the curriculum, and had a seat on the Board of Regents until 1974. Aside from educational endeavors, the institute also promoted industry in the San Francisco Bay Area. Beginning in 1857, on land donated by land baron James Lick, the institute hosted industrial fairs that displayed inventions, art, and products of all kinds to thousands of visitors. Awards were presented to winning exhibitors—many of whom are still in business, including Levi Strauss, Singer Sewing Machines, Goodyear Tire, Boudin Bakery, Heald Business College, Gump's, and Ghirardelli Chocolate.Reinhardt, Richard.

Elections NWT is headed by the Chief Electoral Officer, an officer of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories. Responsibility for the management of territorial elections was devolved to Elections NWT from Elections Canada in 1997. Early history Official results published in the Calgary Tribune July 4, 1888. The results were only published in local newspapers and not compiled into an official publication.The first provisions in legislation regarding the oversight of Northwest Territories elections was adopted in 1880 with an amendment to the Northwest Territories Act passed by the Parliament of Canada. The first election legislation was known as Section 15 under the Act. The election legislation established basic parameters for the creation of electoral districts, eligibility of electors and how the ballot casting process was to be conducted. Oversight was held by the Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories to royally proclaim electoral district boundaries on the formula of 1000 electors per . Other responsibilities included issuing writs and appointing Chief Returning Officers to oversee each election. The first legislation passed by the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly regarding election administration was An Ordinance respecting controverted elections. This piece of legislation was given Royal Assent on August 6, 1884. The ordinance was put in place to deal with potentially corrupt electoral practices. The ordinance required a valid elector to petition the Lieutenant Governor, with an affidavit stating the offense and a fee of $10.00 Canadian dollars to be presented within two months of the writ being returned. In 1888 the Lieutenant Governor ceded his powers of electoral district creation. The powers instead came under federal control with the passage of the North-West Representation Act through the Parliament of Canada. The formula for representation of the electoral districts was revised to 2500 electors per district and no size restriction. The first comprehensive legislation detailing electoral procedures was passed by the Legislative Assembly, An Ordinance respecting Elections to the North-West Legislative Assembly was given Royal Assent on December 31, 1892. This legislation formed the basis of electoral law that is in current use today in the territories as well as Saskatchewan and Alberta. In the years from 1881 until 1905 the Chief Returning Officer for each electoral district was responsible for certifying returns and publishing them in local journals of records. No official publications on election wide statistics and returns were compiled into a single source until the resumption of elections in 1951. Chief Electoral Officer of Canada In 1905 the populated regions of the Northwest Territories were carved out to form Alberta and Saskatchewan. The territorial government was reduced to an appointed council, and the Lieutenant Governor replaced by a Commissioner. The Council and Commissioner were moved by the federal government to the nation's capital, Ottawa, Ontario. Another general election was not held for 46 years. An Elections Ordinance was introduced in 1951 that, among other changes enfranchised women. The Office of the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada then oversaw territorial elections. Revision of territorial electoral districts remained subject to an act of the Parliament of Canada. Establishment of Elections NWT The Northwest Territories Legislature passed an amended Elections Act in the 10th Legislative Assembly in 1987 to create an independent agency to oversee elections. The agency was intended to run the 1991 Northwest Territories general election, but was not ready in time. Elections Canada continued to run elections in the territory until 1997, with the last general election under federal authority occurring in 1995. Elections NWT was supposed to take full control of election regulation in time for the 1995 Northwest Territories general election. Among other issues, lack of funding prevented the Legislative Assembly from appointing a resident Chief Electoral Officer. Instead, the 1995 general election was run by Elections Canada. Jean-Pierre Kingsley served as the Chief Electoral Officer to oversee electoral operations and resident staff. Elections Canada was also responsible for publishing reports and returns related to the election. Nunavut On April 1, 1999 the territory of Nunavut was carved out of the eastern portion of the Northwest Territories. A general election was called to elect members to the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. Elections NWT was mandated to oversee the first Nunavut general election because an agency had not yet been created in the new territory, and the election laws of the Northwest Territories were still in use. The agency also ran Nunavut's first by-election held in the electoral district of Quttiktuq on December 4, 2000. After the general election, David Hamilton, Chief Electoral Officer (NWT) recommended the creation of a similar non-partisan agency for Nunavut. This recommendation helped to establish Elections Nunavut. The recommendations were subsequently adopted. Recent developments Amendments to the Elections and Plebiscites Act in 2010 introduced voter identification requirements into territorial elections. Amendments in early 2007 entrenched fixed election dates into law and gave the Chief Electoral Officer the power to issue writs on order of the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories. The move towards a fixed election date followed a Canada-wide trend, but also avoided the next election being held in December, in conflict with scheduled municipal elections as well as the darkest and coldest day of winter.

If a researcher probes the shape of an intricately curved surface by rolling a ball across it, then features that are continually curved but whose curvature radius is smaller than the ball radius may appear in the ball's description of the geometry as abrupt points, barriers and singularities. Scale-dependent topology If the surface being probed contains connections whose scale is smaller than the ball diameter, then these connections may not appear in the ball's map. If the surface contains a wormhole whose throat narrows to slightly less than the ball's diameter, the ball may be able to enter and explore each wormhole mouth, but will not be able to pass through the throat, and will produce a map in which the narrowing mouth walls each terminate in a sharp geometrical spike. The smooth and multiply connected surface will be mapped by the physics of a \\"large\\" particle as being singly connected and including geometrical singularities. Topology change without topology change If the surface being explored is flexible or elastic, the way the ball is used may affect the reported topology. If the ball is forced into a wormhole mouth that is slightly too small, and the ball and/or throat distorts to allow the ball through, then in the ball's description of the surface, a \\"new\\" wormhole connection has suddenly appeared and disappeared again, and the connectivity of the surface has fluctuated unexpectedly. In this case, no real geometry-change occurs in the deduced shape of the underlying metric – the process identified and \\"caught\\" a wormhole candidate (getting the ball wedged in the throat), then modified the curvature of the metric over time, forcing the throat to inflate to dimensions that allowed it to be traversed. Quantum foam In John Wheeler's geometrodynamic description of quantum mechanics, the small-scale structure of spacetime is described as a quantum foam whose connectivities are not obvious part in large-scale physics, but whose behaviours become more apparent as we probe the surface at progressively smaller scales. In wormhole theory, the idea of this \\"quantum foam\\" is sometimes invoked as a possible way of achieving large-scale wormholes without geometry change – instead of creating a wormhole from scratch, it may be theoretically possible to pluck an existing wormhole connection from the quantum foam and inflate it to a useful size.

It was the home of the American author Washington Irving, best known for his short stories, such as \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" (1819) and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" (1820). This cottage-like estate, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962, reflects Dutch Colonial Revival, Scottish Gothic, and Tudor Revival influences, with its wisteria- covered entrance and jagged crow-stepped gable. History An artist's depiction of the part of Wolfert Acker's former estate that was sold to Washington Irving, who called it \\"Wolfert's Roost\\" before turning it into Sunnyside Washington Irving and his Literary Friends at Sunnyside, by Christian Schussele (1864) In some sense, Sunnyside began almost 200 years before Irving with Wolfert Acker (sometimes spelled Wolfert Eckert), a Dutch- American inhabitant of the region. His property, Wolfert's Roost, was part of the Manor of Philipsburg. Among other buildings, Wolfert's Roost contained a simple two-room stone tenant farmhouse,\\"Sunnyside, Washington Irving Residence\\" on the Irvington Historical Society website built about 1650.Bolton, Robert A history of the county of Westchester, from its first settlement to the present time. New York: Printed by A.S. Gould, 1848. p. 191-192 The property came into the hands of the Van Tassel family, who were married into the Eckert family and owned it until 1802. That year, were deeded to the family of Benson Ferris, one-time clerk of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, whose wife, Maria Acker, was a descendant of Wolfert Acker's.Burstein, 280 In 1832, Washington Irving visited his nephew Oscar Irving who lived near the old stone farmhouse.Jones, 299 Irving had recently undertaken a substantial trip through the prairies of the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers, and the frontier lifestyle made him lament his lack of a home of his own.Burstein, 272 He was also frustrated because he had lived most of his adult life as a guest in other people's homes. As Irving wrote, he was eager for a home and was \\"willing to pay a little unreasonably for it\\".Burstein, 273 Irving finally purchased the property on June 7, 1835 for $1,800;Jones, 320 he would later, through the years, add to the property to expand the estate. Irving wrote a story, \\"Wolfert's Roost\\", about Acker and the site. In a letter to his brother Peter, he described it as \\"a beautiful spot, capable of being made a little paradise ... I have had an architect up there, and shall build upon the old mansion this summer. My idea is to make a little nookery somewhat in the Dutch style, quaint, but unpretending. It will be of stone.\\" Irving requested that his friend and neighbor, English-born painter George Harvey,Olsen, Roberta J. M. \\"George Harvey's Anglo-American atmospheric landscapes\\" Antiques (October 2009) become his aesthetic collaborator and foreman in the house's subsequent remodeling and enlargement, and the landscaping of the grounds in Romantic style, which included creating a pond Irving called \\"The Little Mediterranean\\", with a waterfall that led to a babbling serpentine brook. The result is a \\"cottage\\" that was widely known even at the time, appearing in Harper's Weekly and in guidebooks to the area. Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. said that Sunnyside stood \\"next to Mount Vernon, the best known and most cherished of all the dwellings in our land.\\"Kime (1977), p.151 The public interest in the home, and in Irving, America's first literary star, drew numerous visitors throughout the year, hoping to catch a glimpse of Irving working. Irving's neighbor Nathaniel Parker Willis joked, \\"Could not Sunny-side 'pay' to be got ready for a boarding-house?\\"Kime (1977), p.153 In 1842, Irving accepted a nomination as Ambassador to the Court of Isabella II of Spain. He left Sunnyside in the care of his brother Ebenezer, who lived there with his four grown daughters, who supervised the running of the household. Irving wrote, \\"The only drawback upon all this is the hard trial of tearing myself away from dear little Sunnyside.\\"Jones, 342–343 He returned to New York on September 19, 1846.Jones, 379 Shortly after his return, in 1847, he added to the cottage the \\"Spanish Tower\\", influenced by Spanish monastic architecture and the Alhambra in Granada. It added four bedrooms to the house. Irving died of a heart attack in his bedroom at Sunnyside on November 28, 1859, at age 76.Schmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon.

Sunnyside is now operated as a museum by Historic Hudson Valley, which charges an admission fee. Tours are led by guides in period costume. The museum contains a large collection of Irving's original furnishings and accessories; in particular, all furniture and most accessories in his writer's study are original.

The film was directed by Steve Oedekerk, who also wrote the film and made a cameo appearance as a lip-synching security guard in the film. The film was released in July 1997 and went on to gross over US$40 million at the box office. The theme song was \\"If I Had No Loot\\" by Tony! Toni! Toné!, but it was a remixed version of the song \\"Not Tonight\\"—performed by Lil' Kim and featuring Da Brat, Left Eye, Angie Martinez, and Missy Elliott—that garnered the most attention from the soundtrack as it gained much airplay on television and radio and reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The film was shot at various locations in California and New Jersey. The main California locations were Los Angeles—including the U.S. Bank Tower for Nick's office—and Monrovia. The main location in New Jersey was Bloomfield. Plot Advertising executive Nick Beam (Tim Robbins) thinks his life is going very well, until he returns home from work and finds his wife Ann (Kelly Preston) apparently having an affair with another man. He deduces that the man is his boss, Philip Barrow (Michael McKean), after finding a pair of Philip's cufflinks in the kitchen. On the edge of a nervous breakdown, Nick drives around the city until carjacker T. Paul (Martin Lawrence) jumps into his car and attempts to rob him. Turning the tables on his mugger, Nick kidnaps T. Paul and drives him to a diner in the Arizona desert. After T. Paul robs a gas station, Nick teams up with him and plans to rob Philip in revenge for the affair. Nick knows the combination to a safe in Philip's office containing a large amount of cash, as well as the best time to enter, and where not to venture in the building. T. Paul knows the weaknesses of the security system, how to avoid the cameras, and how to get through any electronic locks that they might encounter. Another criminal duo, Davis \\"Rig\\" Lanlow and Charles \\"Charlie\\" Dunt (John C. McGinley and Giancarlo Esposito) get blamed for the gas station robbery. When they find Nick and T. Paul, the duo ram Nick's truck off the road and hold the pair at gunpoint. After a brief confrontation, T. Paul manages to disarm them, but accidentally shoots Nick in the arm. They make their escape as Rig and Charlie follow them back to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, T. Paul takes Nick to his apartment so they can rest and his wife can bandage Nick's arm; while at the apartment, Nick sees T. Paul's electrical engineering certification and a stack of rejection letters from prospective employers. The next night, the pair execute their plan. During the robbery, Nick damages Philip's prize fertility statue and reveals himself to the security camera, taunting his boss about getting revenge. The pair then hide from a security guard (Steve Oedekerk) who lip-synches to music for over an hour. The guard soon leaves and they leave the office unseen and they settle at a hotel. It becomes bad when Rig and Charlie, who stole Nick's business card and followed them from the office to the hotel, show up at their room, take T. Paul hostage and steal the money. Meanwhile, Nick has gone to the bar to have a drink, where he meets Danielle (Rebecca Gayheart), a flower shop woman he met earlier. When Danielle takes him up to her room to have sex with him, Nick is about to sleep with her until he refuses and leaves. Nick calls Ann to confront her about the affair, but she explains that he was wrong. Nick actually caught Ann's sister and her fiancee in bed when they came into town earlier than expected; having never seen her sister before, Nick mistook her for Ann. He learns that Philip's cufflinks were left behind at a past Christmas party and Ann left them out for Nick to return them to Philip and Ann still loves him. Overcome with remorse, Nick remembers about T. Paul, returns to the room and saves T. Paul from a trap that Rig and Charlie placed him in. They catch up to Rig and Charlie and chase them into an alley. Nick shoots the gun out of Rig's hand and the pair get back the money as they leave Rig and Charlie tied up for the police to find them. As they're driving away, Nick insists on returning the money back to the office, but T. Paul, who had planned on using the money to move his family out of their troubled neighborhood, refuses to take it back and they get into a fight. After they stop fighting, Nick assures T. Paul that nobody will bother to look at the security tapes unless something is missing or damaged and that he can still make things right. T. Paul decides to give the money to Nick and ends their partnership. He walks back home to his family, while Nick drives back home and reunites with Ann. Returning to his job, Nick is told that Philip is reviewing the security tapes to investigate a burglar who vandalized his statue. Nick races to his boss' office but he is too late to stop them, only to discover that the tape was recorded over right before the \\"burglar\\" removed his mask, and that a man identifying himself as an electrician was allowed into the building earlier in the day. Knowing that T. Paul is the one who recorded over the tape, Nick goes to see T. Paul and thanks him for saving Nick from losing his job. In return, Nick offers T. Paul a job as an electrician and a security expert to work on a new security system for his company, which he happily accepts. In the post-credit scene, a mailman shows up at the gas station in Arizona and returns the money that T. Paul stole. Cast *Tim Robbins as Nick Beam *Martin Lawrence as Terrance Paul \\"T.

The school is located on the North Shore in Lake Forest, Illinois, United States, about 30 miles north of Chicago. As of the 2019-2020 school year, the school enrolled 435 students, with the students coming from 13 states and 35 countries. This school is among the most selective boarding schools in the United States.\\"Most Selective Boarding Schools (2018-19\\" at https://www.boardingschoolreview.com/lowest_acceptance_rates/sort/1 The current head of school is José De Jesús. The school is accredited by the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS), and the Secondary School Admission Test Board (SSATB).  History  The Academy (known as \\"LFA\\") was founded in 1857 as a Presbyterian boys preparatory school. Its founding was part of the creation of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Young Ladies' Seminary at Ferry Hall, later simplified to Ferry Hall School, was founded in 1869, and was considered a sister school. Both schools proceeded with their separate missions until the early 1970s, at which point the schools began to coordinate their efforts. A merger of the schools to form the coeducational Lake Forest Academy-Ferry Hall School took place in 1974. Later, the school's name officially became Lake Forest Academy. Lake Forest College was a third component of the original founders' design and opened its doors later although it uses the academy's founding date as its own. It has no formal relationship with the original schools.  Campus  The Formal Gardens Lake Forest Academy is situated on a wooded 150-acre (0.61 km²) campus, which includes a small lake. There are 30 plus buildings on campus, including Reid Hall (formerly the estate of Chicago meat entrepreneur J. Ogden Armour), Corbin Academic Center, Hutchinson Commons, the Student Union (which houses the dining hall), five dormitories and several faculty housing buildings. The Cressey Center for the Arts (formerly the Fine & Performing Arts Center, or FPAC) is the site for all- school meetings, concerts and student theatrical productions; the Reyes Family Science Center; and a new student union building was opened in the fall of 2016,housed within it is the Stuart Center for Global Learning.a gift from Jim Stuart, LFA '59, a member of the family who founded the Quaker Oats Company and whose father R. Douglas Stuart, Jr. was the U.S. Ambassador to Norway under U.S. President Ronald Reagan LFA has a variety of athletic facilities, including the David O. MacKenzie '50 Ice Arena, a swimming pool, the Glore Memorial Gymnasium, the James P. Fitzsimmons Athletic Wing, the Crown Fitness & Wellness Center, tennis courts, all-weather track (new as of 2005), and five full-sized playing fields for football, field hockey, and soccer. Approximately three-quarters of the faculty of Lake Forest Academy live on campus. = Dormitories = Lake Forest Academy houses its approximately 200 boarding students in five different campus dormitories. The dorms are single- sex and are of varying size.  Ferry Hall Dormitory  Ferry Hall Dormitory was completed in the winter of 2012, and the first girls moved into their rooms in February of that year. Named in honor of Ferry Hall School, and taking design elements from that campus, Ferry Hall Dormitory is the first building to be built on the campus of Lake Forest Academy for girls. With 36 beds, Ferry, as it has come to be known by students is the newest dormitory and is located across the field hockey field from Atlass Hall, forming a quad with the Crown Fitness and Wellness Center and Reid Hall. In addition to housing students, Ferry Hall Dormitory is also the home to four faculty apartments.  Atlass Hall  Atlass Hall Atlass is the newest boys' dormitory, and located in the center of campus, it is closest to the academic buildings and dining hall. In addition to generously sized rooms and new furniture, Atlass also sports a comfortable lounge area with a television, sofas, and pool table. Atlass is a two-story building that houses 70 boys and four faculty members in apartments on either north or south end of the dorm. Atlass opened in January, 1999 following a grant from H. Leslie Atlass, Jr., class of 1936, in honor of his father (class of 1912).Atlass Hall, from the official website. According to the inscription on the dormitory, Atlass Sr. was a \\"broadcasting pioneer and innovator.\\"As referenced on the inscription outside Atlass Hall. The financial gift was given with the condition that it be used to construct a new boys' dormitory, since Bates House, the previous boys' dormitory constructed in 1948, was in extremely poor condition.  Warner House  Warner House Warner House houses about 30 boys and five faculty members; four in the actual structure, and one family in the attached Remsen Cottage.Warner House , from the official website. Warner is acknowledged to be the oldest structure on the Lake Forest Academy campus, thought in campus lore to have been a horse stable in the years before the Academy when J. Ogden Armour occupied the campus space. Upon the Academy's relocation to its current physical plant in 1948, the Board of Trustees dedicated the building to Ezra J. Warner, Jr., class of 1895.As referenced on the inscription outside Warner House. Warner is located near the football field and with its relatively large number of faculty, has always been a dormitory that epitomizes the strong connection between students and faculty at LFA.  Marshall Field House  Marshall Field House Marshall Field House (or simply \\"Field\\") is the home to 72 female boarding students. Field is older than the Atlass dorm with its first season of housing students in 1965 but Field House is the closest dorm to the Student Center and has the most spirit of all of the Academy dormitories. Marshall Field House was named after Marshall Field, the founder of Marshall Field and Company, the Chicago-based chain of department stores. A substantial donation was made by Field to the Academy, and the Marshall Field House was dedicated to him on October 9, 1965.As referenced on the inscription outside Marshall Field House.  McIntosh Cottage  McIntosh Cottage McIntosh Cottage (known simply as \\"Mac\\") is a unique dormitory, housing only nine girls in five rooms. In addition to the nine student residents, McIntosh houses two faculty members in apartments.McIntosh Cottage , from the official website. McIntosh was named for Arthur T. McIntosh, class of 1896, by his son.As referenced on the inscription outside McIntosh Cottage.  Athletics  The Academy was formerly a member of the Chicago Independent School League and competed against eight other independent schools in Chicago's suburbs in some sports. The following sports are offered: Fall: *Cheerleading (Girls) *Cross-country running (Boys and Girls) *Field hockey (Girls) *Football *Golf (Boys) *Ice hockey (Prep) *Soccer (Boys) *Swimming (Girls) *Tennis (Girls) *Volleyball (Girls) Winter: *Basketball (Boys and Girls) *Ice hockey (Boys, Girls, and Prep) *Squash (Co- ed) *Swimming (Boys) Spring: *Badminton (Girls) *Baseball (Boys) *Soccer (Girls) *Softball *Tennis (Boys) *Track & field (Boys and Girls) *Volleyball (Boys) *Lacrosse (Boys and Girls) The Bowditch Bell, traditionally rung by sports teams after away victories. At the start of the 2017-18 season, the football program made the transition from playing in 11-player games to 8-player games.http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-forest/sports/ct- lfr-lake-forest-academy-eight-man-football-tl-0831-20170828-story.html Students at LFA may also partake in non-team P.E. activities such as bowling, curling, salsa dance, jogging, lacrosse, water polo, weightlifting, and yoga, as well as a winter/spring musical. LFA has a very strong athletic tradition that began in 1859 when Elmer E. Ellsworth, a close friend of Abraham Lincoln who already had become well known in the leading eastern cities by organizing military units called Zouaves, would be hired to drill the students. Ellsworth would be called to Washington, D.C. by Lincoln who made him a colonel. He was the first officer in the Civil War to give his life for the Union cause. The Academy's drill team had been a pet project of Colonel Ellsworth, so that after the Civil War, when President Lincoln's body was brought through Chicago from Washington to Springfield, it would act as escort and guard of honor from Chicago to the State Capitol. Because of the Ellsworth experiment, a gymnasium would be erected in 1864 and physical training was strongly stressed. In 1876, the LFA baseball team played against Albert Spalding's Chicago White Stockings (later renamed the Cubs) professional team. LFA lost; the score was 31 to 1. In 1888, football would be introduced by math and physics instructor William H. (\\"Little Bill\\") Williams. He would later coach and would be president of the University Athletic Association; and he has been called the father of the Western Collegiate Football Association, subsequently named \\"The Big Ten.\\" The Academy's football tradition would be carried on by such legendary coaches as Clarence Herschberger and especially Ralph Jones whose teams during the 1920s stood among the finest in the entire country. He had been the University of Illinois' head basketball coach and its freshman baseball and football coach. For eight years he would achieve great success in the Big Ten and had written the acknowledged standard work on scientific basketball playing. Under his stewardship of LFA's football program during the 1920s, it became more and more difficult for the school to arrange games with secondary schools, and the schedule would be nearly filled against college freshman and junior college teams. In the early 1930s when an ex-player of Jones' bought the Chicago Bears, he would ask Jones to coach them. He did so with distinction, which included the first NFL championship. Lake Forest Academy is notable for not being a full member of the Illinois High School Association, the body which governs most sports and competitive activities in Illinois. According to a September 2009 interview with the school's athletic director: \\"... LFA's athletic philosophy and active recruitment of international students conflict with the IHSA and that the Caxys are not eligible to compete for state championships in any sport. And LFA was not about to change its private-school philosophy (required athletics for every student) to conform to IHSA standards.\\" Kevin Versen, Director of Athletics 2000 - 2012 .  Mascot  right The LFA mascot is the \\"Caxy\\", which is ancient Greek for \\"ribbit\\" – the croaking sound made by a frog. In the early 1900s, Aristophanes' hit comedy, The Frogs, was the subject of a popular Greek literature class. LFA is believed to be the only school with \\"Caxys\\" as a nickname, although a popular athletic cheer at Yale University uses lines from the same Aristophanes play. The cheer dates back to at least 1896, when a student revolt against suspensions of several students led to dozens of students taking the train to Chicago, where upon alighting at Wells Street they wandered the streets and chanted, \\"Caxy, go wack! Go wack! Go wack! Caxy, go wack! Go wack! Go wack! Hi-O! Hi-O! Paraballoo! 'Cademy! 'Cademy! L.F.U.!!\\"  Traditions  = Move- Up Day = Move-Up Day began as a tradition at Ferry Hall in 1906, originally called Ivy Day, commemorating the annual planting of Ivy at the base of Smith Hall.Pridmore 102 Over time, this tradition would evolve into its current form, usually being held the day before Graduation. Departmental awards and speeches are given, and at the end of the ceremony, each class is invited to \\"move up\\" and literally take the place that they will occupy the next year: seniors move to sit with the alumni, juniors take the former spots of the seniors, and so on. = All-School Handshake = At the beginning of each year every student, faculty member, and administrator gathers in the formal gardens and participates in the all school handshake. The entire school arranges themselves in a line around the periphery of the Formal Gardens and the Head of School begins by shaking the person's hand next to him, then he moves on to the next until each person has shaken the hand of all others. =Field Day= Field Day also began at Ferry Hall, starting in the spring of 1903 with \\"classes competing in races, the high jump, and a five-pound shot put, among other events.\\" Field Day would die out in the 1970s as a result of the merger between Ferry Hall and Lake Forest Academy.Pridmore 104 =The House Cup= The House Cup Competition would be re-established in 2004. The students are divided up into four houses (Bird, Lewis, Sargent, and Welch) and compete in various events throughout the year. The house with the most event points at the end of the year have their name inscribed on a trophy that is displayed in Reid Hall; the colors of the winning team are used in the student handbook cover for the following year. This is based on the House system which is found in British schools; however unlike British schools, students are not divided up based on what dorm they are in. This is similar to the house system in the Harry Potter series, and as such the students often debate which LFA house corresponds with that in the series; there is never any consensus on this. Reputation Reid Hall, which houses the English department and a number of administrative offices. Lake Forest Academy is well-recognized as one of the strongest college preparatory schools in the United States.See \\"These Are the Best Boarding Schools in the United States\\" at http://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/news/a7803/best-boardi... All graduates attend a 4-year college or university, and many of them attend Ivy League schools, \\"Little Ivies\\", and other elite colleges and universities. Ties to the leading colleges and universities with the Academy date back to its very first graduating class. Innovation has been the school's hallmark particularly under strong headmasters such as William Mather Lewis (later president of George Washington University and thereafter Lafayette College), John Wayne Richards,Education: Big Dick's Plans -Time http://www.contenttime.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,789248,00html E.

Corbin, Jr. -tribunedigital-the courant http://...articles.courant.com/1996-02-13/news/9602130208-_mr-corbin- salisbury-summer-school-van-deusen It was Richards' pioneering instructional plan that Time Magazine's inaugural issue featured in its \\"Education\\" section (August 18, 1930). One of the fundamental strengths of the school is the potential for strong relationships that form between students and faculty. Faculty, approximately three-quarters of whom live on campus, also serve as coaches and dorm supervisors. This aspect of the Academy is often promoted by the Admissions Department and others as a feature that sets the school apart from other institutions. Head of School Dr. John Strudwick mentions that \\"LFA prides itself on its small classes and its Advisory system which both promote a unique and productive relationship between faculty and students.\\" On film The campus has been used as a shooting location for several films, among them: Damien: Omen II, Ordinary People, The Babe, and The Package.

It is located just outside the township of Marton in New Zealand. History The school was founded near Shannon in 1891, by Mary Taylor. She named her school Nga Tawa because of the tawa trees that grew nearby. In 1909, the school relocated from Shannon to Calico Line, where it stands today. The original buildings were destroyed by fire in 1924. Originally a private school, Nga Tawa integrated into the state education system in 1980. Today, the school has roughly 250 pupils, most of whom are boarders. The school also accepts a growing number of international students. These students mainly come from but are not limited to, Europe and Asia. Co- curricular Nga Tawa students participate in a wide variety of sporting disciplines. The focus of the school is on equestrian sport. There is stabling capacity for 80 horses on school grounds as well as a dressage arena, a full- sized showjumping arena, 1200m all-weather canter track, and a cross-country course. There are multiple cultural activities offered at the school. Nga Tawa students are represented in a varied array of disciplines and arts, particularly given the significantly smaller student body than most of their local competitors Academic The school previously offered the International Baccalaureate exams (up until the end of the 2013 academic year) as well as the New Zealand NCEA exams.

Set in Glasgow, Scotland, it is her debut feature film and was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. The film won its director numerous awards including the Carl Foreman Award for Newcomer in British Film at the BAFTA Awards, the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival and the Silver Hugo for Best Director at the Chicago International Film Festival. Ratcatcher never received a wide cinematic release. It was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection. Overview Ratcatcher is set in Glasgow, 1973. The city, despite its Victorian grandeur, has some schemes with the poorest housing conditions in western Europe, such as no running hot water, no bathing facilities, and no indoor toilets. The city is midway through a major re-development program, demolishing these schemes and re- housing the tenants in new modern estates. The problems in these schemes are somewhat compounded by the binmen going on strike, creating an additional health hazard and a breeding ground for rats. The main character, James, is a 12-year-old boy, growing up in one of these schemes, which is gradually emptying as the re-housed tenants move out. James, with the rest of his family, (two sisters, one older, one younger, his mum and heavy-drinking father), patiently wait to be re-housed. Plot The film opens focused upon James's friend Ryan Quinn, who is being forced to put on his gum boots to go to visit his father, who is in jail. Ryan chose to play with James instead, and runs off while his mother is not looking. Ryan meets James at the canal and during some rough-house play he is drowned, clearly with James bearing much of the blame for not having raised the alarm. James believes his inaction has gone unnoticed. Ryan's family is eventually re-housed and on the day of leaving, Ryan's mother gives James the pair of brown sandals that she'd bought for Ryan on the day of his death. The film follows the sensitive James as he tries to come to terms with his guilt, and make sense of the insensitive aspects of his environment. James's one escape comes when he takes a bus to the end of the line and ends up in the outskirts of the city, where a new housing estate is under construction. He explores the half-built houses, and wonders in awe at the view from the kitchen window: an expansive field of wheat, blowing in the wind and reaching to the horizon. In a scene central to the film, he climbs through the window and escapes into the blissful freedom of the field. James befriends a girl, Margaret Anne, who he tries to help after her glasses are thrown into the canal by the local gang. James and Margaret Anne become close friends. She is his only other relief from his home environment. Margaret Anne has problems of her own, being abused by the local gang. The duo find comfort in each other's company. One of James' friends, Kenny, receives a pet mouse as a birthday present. After the gang throw the mouse around in the air to make him \\"fly\\", Kenny ties the mouse's tail to a balloon, and the film shows it floating to the moon. Then, Kenny's mouse joins a whole colony of other mice frolicking on the moon. Kenny later falls in the canal and is rescued by James' father, making him briefly into a local hero. Though the military eventually comes and cleans up all the garbage in the neighbourhood, James realizes that his situation will most likely never change. He plunges himself into the canal, and a brief scene is shown, in which James and his family are moving into a new neighbourhood.

The young duke was depicted accompanied by his chancellor Heinrich von Bünau before his main residence - Weimar City Castle. Count Heinrich von Bünau (; 2 June 1697 – 7 April 1762) was a statesman and historian from the Electorate of Saxony, now part of Germany. Life Born in Weissenfels, Bünau was the son of Heinrich von Bünau (1665–1745), a Chancellor of the Elector of Saxony who was created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire on 24 March 1742.The Bünau family's website states that by a \\"private ordinance\\" the family had obliged its men to use only the forenames Günther, Heinrich, and Rudolph, which is why within this very extended family there are numerous men with the name \\"Heinrich von Bünau\\". This has often led to confusion between them in previous research: for example, in the history of the Saxon state, Heinrich, Count of Bünau, has often been confused with his father of the same name, who was Chancellor at the Court of Dresden. After studying at the University of Leipzig, Bünau entered the service of the Electors of Saxony and became an assessor in the Upper Court (Oberhofgericht) at Leipzig. Later he became Senior Consistory President and Privy Councillor (Wirklicher Geheimrat). He received advancement through the good offices of the Cabinet Minister of the Electors of Saxony, Count von Hoym, the uncle of his second wife. In 1734, after Hoym had been ousted by Count Brühl, Heinrich von Bünau was downgraded to the position of Senior Overseer of the County of Mansfeld in Eisleben. In 1741 however he entered the service of the Emperor Charles VII, who made him an Imperial Privy Councillor (Reichshofrat), the first Protestant to fill that role, and employed him as an ambassador in the area of Upper and Lower Saxony. In 1745, after the death of the emperor, Bünau withdrew to his estate at Nöthnitz near Dresden to pursue his scientific and historical studies. Between 1744 and 1751 he had Dahlen Castle built, on the Dahlen estate he had acquired by marriage, and for the decoration of which he commissioned Adam Friedrich Oeser in 1756. In 1751 Bünau was appointed as Guardian Governor of the Duchy of Saxe-Eisenach, during the minority of Duke Constantin, for whom in 1756 he became Prime Minister in Weimar. In 1759, after the death of the Duke, he retired and spent the evening of his life on his estate at Ossmannstedt, near Weimar,Apart from the estates of Nöthnitz, Dahlen, and Ossmannstedt already mentioned, Bünau also owned those of Domsen, Göllnitz and Gross-Tauschwitz. where he died on 7 April 1762.His house at Ossmannstedt was used for a few years after his death as a summer house by the Duchess Anna Amalia of Saxe- Weimar-Eisenach and her sons. It was bought in 1797 by Christoph Martin Wieland. It is now known as the Wielandgut and contains the Wieland Museum. Library Bünau's private library comprised some 42,000 volumes. It was housed at first in Dresden, then on his estate at Nöthnitz, and he allowed public access to it. The archaeologist Johann Joachim Winckelmann from Stendal worked at Nöthnitz between 1748 and 1754 as Bünau's secretary.

He established himself as one of the most accomplished and admired light music pianists of his generation. Music career Carmen Cavallaro was born in New York City. Known as the “Poet of the Piano”,Vocalion Records # VL 73862 he showed a gift for music from age three, picking out tunes on a toy piano. His parents were encouraged to develop the child’s musical talents and he studied classical piano in the United States. As a young pianist, he toured Europe, performing in many capitals. In 1933 Cavallaro joined Al Kavelin's orchestra, where he quickly became the featured soloist. After four years he switched to a series of other big bands, including Rudy Vallee's in 1937. He also worked briefly with Enric Madriguera and Abe Lyman. Cavallaro formed his own band, a five-piece combo, in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1939. His popularity grew and his group expanded into a 14-piece orchestra, releasing some 19 albums for Decca over the years. Although his band traveled the country and played in all the top spots, he made a particular impact at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco, which became a favored venue, and which also later became a favorite spot of George Shearing and Mel Tormé. Other venues where he drew large audiences included New York’s Waldorf-Astoria, Chicago’s Palmer House and the Coconut Grove in Los Angeles. In 1963 he had a million-seller hit recording of the song Sukiyaki. One of Cavallaro's vocalists, Guy Mitchell, later became famous in his own right. Cavallaro's single best-selling recording was his pop version of \\"Chopin's 'Polonaise'\\", Op. 53. He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6301 Hollywood Boulevard in HollywoodAt 6301 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California Influences and style Cavallaro developed a piano-playing style of glittering and rippling arpeggios to augment his melody, which was often arranged in thick and lush triple- and quadruple-octave chords. His musical interests and arrangements included dance music, particularly Latin rhythms, tangos and strict tempo dancing styles, as well as some pop and jazz arrangements of classical melodies. In this, he is often cited as being influenced by pianist Eddy Duchin. Liberace was greatly influenced by both Cavallaro and Duchin.Liberace joked that he stole \\"everything but the flashy rings\\" from Cavallaro. All three shared a propensity for arranging classical piano themes in a pop idiom. Cavallaro became a member of ASCAP in 1957.IMDB Biography for Carmen Cavallaro Although he wrote several songs, including \\"Dolores My Own\\" and \\"Anita\\", the most popular were \\"While the Nightwind Sings\\" and \\"Masquerade Waltz\\". Radio and film Cavallaro also became famous through the media of radio and film, firstly with his regular program on NBC during the 1940s, The Sheaffer Parade, of which he was the host and later in films where he played himself, starting with Hollywood Canteen (1944), then Diamond Horseshoe, Out of This World (both 1945) and The Time, The Place and The Girl (1946). His most celebrated film achievement was playing the piano music for actor Tyrone Power’s hands to mime, in The Eddy Duchin Story (1956). Personal life Cavallaro was married to Wanda Cavallaro on 6 May 1935. They had three children. They were divorced on 28 December 1962. Cavallaro died from prostate cancer on 12 October 1989 in Columbus, Ohio. He was survived by his wife Donna S.

Note that the fiddler crab flips to being its own mirror image with every complete circulation In wormhole theory, a non-orientable wormhole is a wormhole connection that appears to reverse the chirality of anything passed through it. It is related to the \\"twisted\\" connections normally used to construct a Möbius strip or Klein bottle. In topology, this sort of connection is referred to as an Alice handle. Theory = \\"Normal\\" wormhole connection = Matt Visser has described a way of visualising wormhole geometry: # take a \\"normal\\" region of space # \\"surgically remove\\" spherical volumes from two regions (\\"spacetime surgery\\") # associate the two spherical bleeding edges, so that a line attempting to enter one \\"missing\\" spherical volume encounters one bounding surface and then continues outward from the other. Although this set of instructions seems straightforward, there are two topologically distinct ways in which the two surfaces can be mapped to one another. If we draw a map of the Earth's surface onto one wormhole mouth, how does this map appear at the second mouth? For a \\"conventional\\" wormhole, the network of points will be seen at the second surface to be inverted, as if one surface was the mirror image of the other – countries will appear back-to-front, as will any text written on the map. This is as it should be, because in a sense, the second mouth is showing us the view of the same map seen \\"from the other side\\". = \\"Reversed\\" wormhole connection = The alternative way of connecting the surfaces makes the \\"connection map\\" appear the same at both mouths. This configuration reverses the \\"handedness\\" or \\"chirality\\" of any objects passing through. If a spaceship pilot writes the word \\"IOTA\\" on the inside of their forward window, then, as the ship's nose passes through the wormhole and the ship's window intersects the surface, an observer at the other mouth looking in through the glass should see the same word, \\"IOTA\\", written on the window of the emerging spaceship. Once the spaceship has passed through, the curious onlooker may peek inside the spaceship cockpit and find that what is written on the inside of the glass is actually \\"ATOI\\" – the handedness of the writing (and of every other part of the spaceship, including the pilot) has been inverted by its passage through the wormhole. Consequences As well as turning left-handed screwthreads into right-handed screwthreads, and left- handed gloves into right-handed gloves, reversing the chirality of an object is also usually associated with the idea of reversing the sign of electromagnetic charge – if a positron can be considered as a time-reversed electron, it can also be considered as an electron aging conventionally, but with one spatial dimension reversed. The existence of a traversable nonorientable wormhole would seem to allow the conversion of matter to antimatter, and vice versa. A universe that includes one of these \\"non- orientable\\" connections does not allow a global definition of whether a particle is \\"really\\" matter or antimatter, and this sort of universe, with no global definition of charge is referred to in research papers as an \\"Alice universe.\\" Alice universe In theoretical physics, an Alice universe is a hypothetical universe with no global definition of charge. What a Klein bottle is to a closed two-dimensional surface, an Alice universe is to a closed three-dimensional volume. The name is a reference to the main character in Lewis Carroll's children's book, Through the Looking-Glass. An Alice universe can be considered to allow at least two topologically-distinct routes between any two points, and if one connection (or \\"handle\\") is declared to be a \\"conventional\\" spatial connection, at least one other must be deemed to be a non-orientable wormhole connection. Once these two connections are made, we can no longer define whether a given particle is matter or antimatter. A particle might appear as an electron when viewed along one route, and as a positron when viewed along the other. If we define a reference charge as nominally positive and bring it alongside our \\"undefined charge\\" particle, the two particles may attract if brought together along one route, and repel if brought together along another – the Alice universe loses the ability to distinguish between positive and negative charges, except locally. As with a Möbius strip, once the two distinct connections have been made, we can no longer identify which connection is \\"normal\\" and which is \\"reversed\\" – the lack of a global definition for charge becomes a feature of the global geometry. This behaviour is analogous to the way that a small piece of a Möbius strip allows a local distinction between two sides of a piece of paper, but the distinction disappears when the strip is considered globally. = Notes = In another nod to Lewis Carroll, charge with magnitude but no persistently identifiable polarity is referred to in the literature as Cheshire charge, after Lewis's Cheshire cat, whose body would fade in and out, and whose only persistent property was its smile.

The expressway was built in stages, opening between 1976 and 1987. The expressway was supposed to be part of a multi-expressway system that failed in the 1970s due to heavy local opposition and financial burdens. The original designation for the expressway was State Road 449, but was switched to State Road 618, which remained a hidden designation until the early 2000s, when it began appearing on maps and in atlases. The expressway features an elevated bridge, the world's first reversible, all-electronic, elevated express lane project, opened in 2006, with the hidden designation of State Road 618A. The entire expressway ended cash collection on September 17, 2010, going all-electronic for both the express lanes and the main expressway. The expressway was renamed Lee Roy Selmon Crosstown Expressway in 1999, in honor of former Tampa Bay Buccaneers hall-of-fame football player Lee Roy Selmon. The \\"Crosstown\\" portion of the name was dropped in 2008, although it is still referred to as the \\"Crosstown\\" by the majority of the population.

It makes its way northeast along a lightly used CSX rail corridor for the first four miles before heading east towards downtown Tampa. From Florida Ave, the highway winds through the Channelside District and the southern fringe of Ybor City before continuing due eastward towards 78th St. There is a connection to I-4 just east of 22nd St that allows commuters to easily move between various points throughout Hillsborough County and beyond. Just west of 78th St, the expressway crosses over Palm River (the southernmost portion of the Tampa Bypass Canal) and makes a southeastward curve towards US 301. From there, the highway crosses over US 301 and Falkenburg Road before ending at a trumpet interchange with I-75 in Brandon. =Express lanes= The reversible express lanes (REL), also known as State Road 618A, begin at Meridian Avenue in downtown Tampa, following the main expressway's path from above in the center median for most of its journey. Almost the entire route is elevated, with the exception of at-grade segments between 26th Street and 39th Street, as well as between 78th Street and I-75. An at-grade provision was made between 26th Street and 39th Street to accommodate the newly opened Interstate 4/Selmon Expressway Connector. This at-grade portion is equipped with an eastbound (only) slip-ramp to allow commuters from South Tampa to utilize the REL. A toll gantry is located just east of 78th Street and is the only toll gantry along the entire REL. Between 78th Street and US 301, slip-ramps exist for both directions (exiting and entering the REL). The REL crosses over I-75 and ends at Town Center Boulevard in Brandon (near Westfield Brandon). From there, the highway disperses onto the Brandon Parkway, which connects to Providence Road and other redesigned thoroughfares to allow seamless connection to points within Brandon and surrounding areas. Operating hours On weekdays, the REL operates westbound from 6:00-10:00am. From 10:00am-1:00pm, the road is in transitional operation in which the western segment between 78th Street and Downtown Tampa carries westbound traffic and the eastern segment from US 301 to Brandon Parkway carries eastbound traffic. Then, from 3:00pm through 6:00am the next morning, the entire REL operates eastbound only. On weekends and holidays, the REL stays operating in the eastbound direction from 3:00pm Friday afternoon through 6:00am Monday morning. =Lane counts= For most of its length, the Selmon is four lanes (two in each direction). However, some six-lane segments (three lanes in each direction) exist. * Four lanes (two in each direction) from Gandy Boulevard to just east of Morgan Street. * Six lanes (three in each direction) from just east of Morgan Street to the I-4/Selmon Connector. * Four lanes through the I-4/Selmon Connector interchange. * Six lanes from the I-4/Selmon Connector to 50th Street. * Four lanes from 50th St to just east of 78th Street. * Six lanes from just east of 78th St to just west of US 301. * Four lanes through the US 301 interchange. * Six lanes from just east of US 301 to Falkenburg Road. * Four lanes from Falkenburg Road to I-75 * The elevated lanes consist of three lanes from Meridian Avenue to just east of 78th Street, narrowing down to two lanes as it travels to the Brandon Parkway. =Open-road tolling= The Expressway has no staffed toll gates. To accommodate motorists who do not have SunPass transponders (such as those from out of state), the Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority and Florida's Turnpike Enterprise utilize a \\"Toll-By- Plate\\" program. Vehicles without SunPass transponders are photographed and their license plates are read. If the license plate number is associated with a Toll-by-Plate account, that account is used to pay the toll. If there is no account, notification of the toll is mailed to the vehicle's owner, with penalties being imposed after 30 days. Toll-By-Plate administrative fees are also applied to bills not associated with a registered account. History =The South Crosstown Expressway= The Crosstown Expressway is the southern component of what was planned to be a system of expressways throughout the Tampa area from the 1950s to 1970's, but the rest were cancelled by the 1980s due to financial problems, land acquisition and community revolts.Hillsborough's Cancelled Freeways The first six miles of the tollway was built in the mid-1970s on a CSX rail line, from the western terminus at Gandy Blvd. at Dale Mabry Highway, making an eastward turn at Platt Street/Willow Avenue, snaking around historic Hyde Park before ending at a 3/4-mile, six lane viaduct, spanning the Hillsborough River in downtown Tampa, ending at Florida Avenue. Ridership was low when it opened in 1976, as people were less willing to drive the toll road when free roads were available nearby. The remaining nine miles of the expressway was built and opened in stages between 1979 and 1987, with the expressway extending to Falkenburg Road in 1983 and connecting to its eastern terminus of I-75 in 1987.Florida @ SouthEastRoads – Florida 618 In 1975, a contest was held to determine the logo of the expressway. Only one entry was submitted, a picture of pirate Jose Gaspar with the title \\"TAMPA CROSSTOWN EXPRESSWAY\\", all on a blue background. This logo was phased out in the early 2000s. In 2006, an \\"interim\\" logo featuring a bridge over a highway reading \\"Selmon-Crosstown Expressway\\" was unveiled but was never widely implemented along the expressway. In 2008, a more permanent logo was unveiled, which consists of the FDOT standard \\"TOLL 618\\" plates and a \\"Selmon Expressway\\" logo. This new logo, which replaced the previous Crosstown Expressway logos, reads \\"SELMON EXPRESSWAY\\" with downtown Tampa in purple and three ribbons, a yellow one in the middle of two teal ones going towards the city. In 2001, a city truck equipped with a hydraulic lift slammed into the 34th Street overpass when the vehicle's lift was unknowingly raised. The accident crippled a support beam, which had to be replaced. In 2005, a similar vehicle destroyed the overhead exit sign at Euclid Ave (Exit 2) and over a month passed before a replacement sign (and structure) were installed. Also, over the years there have been a few accidents that made headlines, where vehicles, traveling at high speeds, crashed into one of the toll plazas. In 2004, the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority accelerated a planned toll hike that would increase the mainline toll plazas by 25 cents and raise the 22nd St Exit tolls to 75 cents from its original date in 2009 to 2007. The toll hike took effect on January 1, 2007, with the hike for the 22nd St ramps going into effect in late June 2006. On September 17, 2010, cash collection on the Selmon Expressway ended in favor of open road tolling. The original toll plazas were removed and replaced with toll gantries similar to the ones installed on the express lanes, allowing free-flowing movement throughout the tollway. The tollway takes either SunPass or \\"We Bill You,\\" and customers who do not have either account will be billed later for their use on the expressway.Selmon Expressway Converts to All-Electronic Tolling Sept. 17 Selmon Expressway Prepares for September 2010 Conversion to All-Electronic Tolling =The reversible elevated lanes= The reversible elevated lanes (REL), aimed at cutting traffic congestion times, were originally envisioned in 1995 by the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA) as an innovative idea to increase capacity along the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway from Downtown Tampa to Brandon without acquiring additional right-of-way. Instead, an elevated, three-lane bridge was built over the existing median of the expressway. Planning for the project began around 1995/1996, but final designs/planning were not made until the later 1990s. The Lee Roy Selmon Expressway and the Reversible Express Lanes at 78th Street Construction commenced in 2003 but in 2004, a portion of the elevated bridge collapsed during construction, halting construction for about a year. The segment was repaired and all other piers were reinforced when construction resumed in 2005. In spring 2005, two realigned sections of the eastbound lanes opened. One section is between 22nd Street and 39th Street, the other between 78th Street and I-75. The at-grade sections of the reversible lanes now follow the old alignments. The Brandon Gateway section of the elevated bridge opened in November 2005 and gained an overwhelmingly positive input by commuters. Thus the bridge was kept open beyond January 2006 (when it was originally scheduled to close for more bridge work) during the evening rush hour. The western end of the reversible lanes bridge empties traffic onto the recently reconstructed Meridian Avenue On July 18, 2006 at 6 am, the reversible lanes opened to westbound morning traffic (only). Long lines were formed at the Brandon Gateway well in advance as many anticipated using the new road. However, the scene from news helicopter snapshots showed that only a handful of drivers actually ended up using the new bridge, compared to the number that was expected. These findings may be blamed partly on the lack of advance notification to commuters, the number of commuters who own a SunPass transponder, and an unrelated traffic incident on Ashley Drive in downtown Tampa. Many other questions were raised as a result of the low traffic volume along the reversible lanes. The eastbound direction opened to traffic on August 29, 2006 at 3:30 pm. A \\"Grand Opening\\" celebration was held on September 23, 2006, with festivities including a 5k and 10k run across the new bridge. On November 1, 2006, Florida's Turnpike Enterprise began a pilot program with the THEA, known as \\"Toll-by-Plate.\\" This program allows occasional commuters to utilize the reversible express lanes through a system of high-resolution cameras (at the 78th Street barrier checkpoint/gantry) which snap photos of license plates. The commuter is then sent a bill via mail. The THEA reports that over 500 commuters have already signed up for the Toll-by-Plate program since its debut. The program's success so far may lead to future expansion to other tolled thoroughfares in Florida, such as the lower level of the Selmon Expressway, and the Veterans Expressway/Suncoast Parkway. The project was officially completed in 2007 after four years of construction at a cost of $420 million. Level of service was upgraded from an \\"F\\" to an \\"A\\" as commuters are now able to travel at full speed, cutting travel time by as much as 60 minutes per day. The elevated lanes project won the prestigious \\"2007 IBTTA President's Award: Most Innovative Toll Transportation Project in the World,\\" along with 22 awards for engineering excellence and community-friendly design. This modern solution is a prototype for eliminating urban traffic congestion and reducing green house gases. Over 12 million trips on the elevated lanes have been completed with no reported accidents. In June 2009, a settlement was reached between the THEA, URS, and other parties, regarding the 2004 collapse of the elevated lanes and the lawsuit that followed. The THEA was able to obtain approximately $75 million from the settlement, which will be used to pay off debts and help fund an upcoming widening and rehabilitation project along the downtown Tampa viaduct. =The Interstate 4/State Road 618 Connector Project= This is a connector between the Selmon Expressway and nearby Interstate 4 to the north, designed to help filter hazardous cargo away from Ybor City to the Port of Tampa. The 39th Street interchange (Exit 10) permanently closed on May 13, 2010 to make way for the I-4/Selmon Expressway Connector ramps. The connector opened to traffic on January 6, 2014. =Downtown viaduct widening project= In conjunction with the I-4/Selmon Connector project, the THEA widened the section of the downtown viaduct from just east of Morgan St to 20th St from four lanes (two in each direction) to six lanes (three in each direction). This was done to help strengthen the expressway's capacity as usage of the I-4/Selmon Connector grows. This particular project was budgeted at $70 million, with some of the funds coming from a settlement between the THEA and other parties for the 2004 collapse of the elevated express lanes at 50th St. Future =Testing of automated vehicles= The Selmon's REL was selected as one of ten sites throughout the US that could test out automated vehicles. Such testing would occur during off-peak hours and would require a complete closure of the REL during those times. Selmon Expressway becomes testing ground for automated vehicles - 2014 Jan 31, retrieved 2014 Feb 28. =Bus toll lanes= A partnership between the THEA and Hillsborough Area Regional Transit is exploring the placement of dedicated toll lanes along the Selmon that would be utilized by both private vehicles and transit buses . =Contra- flow study= A study regarding a contra-flow plan for the Selmon during a large-scale evacuation is currently underway. The Hillsborough County EOC and THEA are planning out just how the expressway could be used as an evacuation route. The big limitation of the plans was the reason that the original plans were cancelled is the I-75 trumpet interchange, which narrows to one lane on three of the four ramps to and from the interstate. The current plan, if approved, is as follows. * Selmon Expressway mainline from Gandy Blvd to Florida Ave: Would be one-way eastbound. * Selmon Expressway mainline from Florida Ave to I-75: Would be two-way with westbound direction allowing first responders and other emergency personnel quick access to downtown. * Selmon Expressway reversible express lanes: Would be one-way eastbound for the entire route. =Gandy Boulevard connector= The THEA is in the planning stages of building a corridor (in the form of a two-laned, tolled, elevated viaduct) from the current western terminus of the expressway west to the Gandy Bridge via Gandy Boulevard, a project that has been cancelled and revived in recent years. As of December, 2015, the project is back on track and is anticipated to begin construction sometime in 2017, with a projected completion in late 2020 or early 2021.Gandy PD&E; Study Retrieved April 27, 2010 Exit list ;Elevated express lanes References External links * * Hillsborough County Expressway Authority Website The Tampa expressway authority that owns Selmon Expressway. * Category:Toll roads in Florida Category:Freeways in the United States Category:Roads with a reversible lane Category:Expressways in the Tampa Bay Area Category:1976 establishments in Florida ","title":"Lee Roy Selmon Expressway"},{"id":"2609030","text":"Grand Harbour The Grand Harbour (; ), also known as the Port of Valletta, is a natural harbour on the island of Malta. It has been substantially modified over the years with extensive docks, wharves, and fortifications.  Description  View of the Grand Harbour looking towards the sea View of the Grand Harbour looking towards Marsa The harbour mouth faces north east and is bounded to the north by Saint Elmo Point and further sheltered by an isolated breakwater and is bounded to the south by Ricasoli Point. Its north west shore is formed by the Sciberras peninsula, which is largely covered by the city of Valletta and its suburb Floriana. This peninsula also divides Grand Harbour from a second parallel natural harbour, Marsamxett Harbour. The main waterway of Grand Harbour continues inland almost to Marsa. The southeastern shore of the harbour is formed by a number of inlets and headlands, principally Rinella Creek, Kalkara Creek, Dockyard Creek, and French Creek, which are covered by Kalkara and the Three Cities: Cospicua, Vittoriosa, and Senglea. The harbour has been described as Malta's greatest geographic asset. With its partner harbour of Marsamxett, Grand Harbour lies at the centre of gently rising ground. Development has grown up all around the twin harbours and up the slopes so that the whole bowl is effectively one large conurbation. Much of Malta's population lives within a three kilometer radius of Floriana. This is now one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. The harbours and the surrounding areas make up Malta's Northern and Southern Harbour Districts. Together, these districts contain 27 of 68 local councils. They have a population of 213,722 which make up over 47% of the total population of the Maltese islands.  History  The Grand Harbour in 1750 The Maltese islands have a long history, mainly due to its strategic location and natural harbours, mainly the Grand Harbour as well as Marsamxett. The Grand Harbour has in fact been used since prehistoric times. Megalithic remains have been found on the shores of the Grand Harbour. The Kordin Temples, the earliest of which date back to around 3700 BC, overlooked the harbour from Corradino Heights. Another megalithic structure possibly existed underwater off Fort Saint Angelo, but this can no longer be seen. Punic and Roman remains were also found on the shores of the harbour. By the 12th and 13th centuries, the Castrum Maris had been built in what is now Birgu. It might have been built instead of ancient buildings, possibly Phoenician or Roman temples, or an Arab fortress. In 1283, the Battle of Malta was fought at the entrance of the Grand Harbour. Aragonese forces defeated a larger Angevin force and captured 10 galleys. The Grand Harbour was the base for the Order of Saint John for 268 years, from 1530 to 1798. They settled in the city of Birgu and improved its fortifications, including rebuilding the Castrum Maris as Fort Saint Angelo. In July 1551, Barbary corsairs and Ottoman forces raided Malta. They landed at Marsamxett and marched upon the Grand Harbour, but did not attack as they found the town of Birgu too well fortified to attack. Although this attempt was unsuccessful, the Ottoman force later managed to sack Gozo and conquer Tripoli within the same campaign. After the attack, Fort Saint Elmo and Fort Saint Michael were built to better protect the harbour in any future attacks. The city of Senglea was also founded soon afterwards. Later on in the 1550s, a tornado struck the Grand Harbour, killing 600 people and destroying a shipping armada. The area was the scene of much of the fighting in the Great Siege of Malta of 1565 when the Ottomans attempted to eject the Order of St John but were ultimately defeated. After the siege, the capital city of Valletta was built on the Sciberras peninsula on the north west shore of the harbour. Over the years, more fortifications and settlements were founded within the Grand Harbour, including Fort Ricasoli and the towns of Floriana and Cospicua. New dock built in 1867 During the French occupation of Malta, the harbour area was blockaded by Maltese rebels on land and the Royal Navy at sea. The French eventually capitulated in September 1800 and Malta became a British protectorate, later a colony. During the British colonial rule, the harbour became a strategic base for the Royal Navy and the base of the Mediterranean Fleet. HMS Rodney in the harbour during the Allied invasion of Sicily. The whole area was savagely bombed during the Second Siege of Malta during World War II, as the docks and military installations around the port became targets for Axis bombers. However collateral damage wrecked much of Valletta and The Three Cities, and caused large numbers of civilian casualties. NATO warships in the harbour during 1967. Malta Dockyard is still active but with the departure of the British Military the harbour lost much of its military significance. A considerable part of Malta's commercial shipping is now handled by the new free port at Kalafrana, so the harbour is much quieter than it was in the first half of the 20th century. = A Vision for Malta's Grand Harbour = The Grand Harbour, the backdrop to Malta's history, is set to experience a regeneration as in September 2007, the Maltese Government unveiled 20 proposed projects that would revamp the area while respecting its historic value. The 20 proposals are these: * A New Cruise Liner Terminal in Senglea * Extending the Valletta Cruise Liner Terminal * One promenade from Ricasoli all the way to Senglea * New yacht marina in Kalkara * Conversion of Sir Paul Boffa hospital into a hotel * A new tourism and cultural sector * A center for the audio-visual industry in Fort Ricasoli * Restoration of Villa Bighi * Super yachts along the Senglea waterfront * Discontinuing the Cleaning of Tanks * A Commercial Maritime Park * Maritime institute * Maritime services * Closing down the Marsa Power Station * Afforestation of the Rinella Valley * Rinella Creek * New maritime infrastructure in Kalkara * The reorganisation of Xatt il-Mollijiet * Extension of quay infrastructe in Coradino * A Base for Towing Services in Xatt il-Knisja Coordinates: Around the Grand Harbour from Fort Ricasoli to Fort St. Elmo View of the Grand Harbour in the 18th century Aerial view of the Grand Harbour in 2006 *Fort Ricasoli *Rinella Bay *Bighi *Kalkara Creek Marina Road, Kalkara Kalkara Strand, Kalkara Mandraġġ Strand, Birgu *Fort St. Angelo *Dockyard Creek or Cottonera Marina St. Angelo Strand, Birgu Xatt il-Forn, Birgu Xatt ir-Risq, Birgu Xatt San Lawrenz, Birgu Dock No. 1, Bormla Xatt Juan B.

The college offers more than 50 majors. Its campus encompasses approximately three city blocks next to downtown Marietta and enrolls 1,200 full-time students. History Marietta College began as the Muskingum Academy, in 1797, which was the birth of higher education in Ohio. In April 1797, which was only nine years after Ohio had been settled, a committee of Marietta citizens, led by General Rufus Putnam (the \\"Father of Ohio\\"), met to establish a college. Muskingum Academy, completed late that year, became the first institution of its kind in the Northwest Territory, providing “classical instruction ... in the higher branches of an English education.” Its first instructor was David Putnam, a 1793 Yale graduate.Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

Athletics Don Drumm Stadium / Press Box. Dyson Baudo Recreation Center. Marietta College is a member of the NCAA Division III and the Ohio Athletic Conference, a 10-team collegiate conference founded in 1902 and the third-oldest in the nation. The Pioneers compete in 22 varsity sports, including teams in crew, baseball, basketball, football, women's volleyball, track & field, cross country, tennis, soccer, and softball. They added men's and women's golf to the athletic department for the 2017 season, and lacrosse for 2018. Marietta's baseball team has won six national championships, an NCAA Division III record: in 1981, 1983, 1986, 2006, 2011 and 2012. The first three were under legendary coach Don Schaly, who died on March 9, 2005; the three most recent under coach Brian Brewer. By repeating as the national champions in 2011 and 2012 the Pioneers became the first team to do that in NCAA Division III play since the Rowan University Profs won back to back championships in 1978 and 1979. Five former Pioneer baseball players—Kent Tekulve, Duane Theiss, Jim Tracy, Terry Mulholland and Matt DeSalvo—have reached the Major League level. Since 2010, the men's basketball program has become one of the best in NCAA Division III, averaging 21.9 victories a season during that stretch. The crew program competes at the annual Dad Vail Regatta each spring in both men's and women's events, and earned a gold medal in the Men's Varsity Eight in 2006, and gold medals in the Women's Varsity Eight in 2011, 2012, and 2014.

It is dedicated to Canadian aid workers who have lost their lives during foreign deployments. As a monument, it is internationally unique in its form and purpose.  Motivation for the Monument In 1996 two Canadian aid workers were killed in a short period in different incidents. Tim Stone, the executive director of the organization PATH Canada (Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health) died in the crash of hijacked Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 on the Comoros Islands. Three weeks later 51-year-old nurse Nancy Malloy of the Canadian Red Cross and working with the International Committee of the Red Cross died in a field hospital in the Chechen city Novye Atagi near Grozny. She was murdered in her sleep along with five other colleagues by unknown assailants. The organization PATH Canada, the Canadian Red Cross, and the Canadian Nurses Association sought a way to remember their service and began a project to realize a monument in their and other fallen aid workers' honor. The monument itself was dedicated four years later on June 28, 2001.  Monument  The monument is located in Rideau Falls Park in Ottawa. It consists of a rectangular bronze arch with two bronze feathers, one on the top and the other at the side of the arch, all standing on a granite platform. There are also two granite benches where visitors can sit. The height of the monument is 3.35 metres with a base area of 4.27 x 4.88 metres. The design was created by John Greer from Halifax, Nova Scotia who won the monument's national design competition in May 1999. His design was entitled \\"Reflection\\" which also became the name of the monument. The project was financed by a private fundraising effort and an approximately $75,000 investment by the Canadian International Development Agency. The monument has three key messages. First, it is intended to appreciate Canada's long-standing activities in international development and humanitarian assistance; second, it honors all Canadians who died while serving in these fields abroad; third, it pays a personal tribute to Nancy MalloyNancy Mammloy was assassinated in the ICRC Hospital of Novye Atagi (Chechenya) on December 17, 1996 where she worked as an ICRC delegate. and Tim Stone.

This is a rural area, about from the coast, with dairy farming as the major industry. Local visitor attractions include a cheese factory as well as walking, camping and 4-wheel driving in the Kenilworth State Forest. History Dalla (also known as Dalambara and Dallambara) is a language of the Upper Brisbane River catchment, notably the Conondale Range. Dalla is part of the Duungidjawu language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Somerset and Moreton Bay Regional Councils, particularly the towns of Caboolture, Kilcoy, Woodford and Moore. The Mary River was known to the Aboriginals as the Numabulla and the name for the Kenilworth area being Hinka Booma. In 1842 Andrew Petrie named the river as the Wide Bay River. In 1847 that Governor Fitzroy renamed the river after his wife Mary. Richard Joseph Smith tendered to set up the first cattle run on the east bank of the Mary River in 1850. At the time Mrs Smith was reading Sir Walter Scott's novel \\"Kenilworth\\" and she decided to name the property after the novel. In 1877, of land was resumed from the Kenilworth North pastoral run to be used as small farmers. The land was offered for selection from 17 April 1877. During the second half of the 19th Century, the Smiths took up more land. In October 1921 the Kenilworth Estate of was auctioned having been subdivided into town lots, dairy blocks and grazing blocks. Up to £30 was paid for a town lot while the dairy blocks fetched up to £18 per acre and grazing blocks up to £7 per acre, realising a total of £46,000 from the sale overall. Other settlers arrived in 1891 originally intending to grow small crops. There was a ready market at the goldfields in Gympie but after the floods of 1893, 1895 and 1898 had wiped out their crops, most ventured into dairying and pig breeding. In 1901 the Kenilworth Farmers' Association was formed and in 1907 they built the Kenilworth Farmers Assembly Hall. This later housed a library and hosted dances. In 1905 the Association was responsible for establishing a co- operative butter factory which opened in Caboolture in 1907. Also established was the Kenilworth Farmers' Co-operative Store in Eumundi. In 1912 a steam- powered sawmill was built on Coolabine Creek. In 1921 Kenilworth Station was sold off and divided into dairy farms and allotments. By 1925 all the large estates in the district had been subdivided and sold. Today dairying is still a major part of farming in the area but there has been diversification into fruit and vegetables and pig farming. Kenilworth Post Office opened by 1926 (a receiving office had been open from 1896). The first store was opened in Kenilworth on 2 January 1924 as well as the new hall opening and the first butcher's shop appeared in 1925. Kenilworth Provisional School built by the community opened on 22 January 1900. This school became a State School on 1 January 1909. (This school was in the locality now known as Gheerulla). Kenilworth Township was opened in the Kenilworth Hall on 21 October 1924. The hall, in 1926, was equipped to show silent pictures. The site for a public recreation ground was purchased in 1927 and in 1933, the Public Hall was moved to this new location. The Church of England Mary Valley Parish was established in 1925. The Kenilworth Library opened in 1986 with a major refurbishment in 2000. At the 2006 census, Kenilworth had a population of 238. In the 2011 census, Kenilworth had a population of 559 people. Attractions Kenilworth has a 'Living History' Museum with a theatrette which shows a history of the district to visitors, together with displays covering many areas of history past. Kenilworth Homestead still exists, though the 10,000 hectare cattle station is now reduced to 50 hectares. Since 1875, the Homestead and out- buildings have continually been restored and extended, still keeping as much of its original structure as possible. It is now used as a camping and riding centre.

In total, the ALR covers approximately and includes private and public lands that may be farmed, forested or are vacant. Some ALR blocks cover thousands of hectares while others are small pockets of only a few hectares. The reserve is administered by the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC), consisting of a chair and six vice-chairs appointed by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council of British Columbia (cabinet) and twelve regular commissioners appointed by the provincial Minister of Agriculture. The ALR was established by the British Columbia New Democratic Party government of Dave Barrett in 1973, when it was considered to be the most progressive legislation of its kind in North America. It was intended to permanently protect valuable agricultural land that has among the most fertile soil in the country from being lost. Despite having been in existence for over 40 years, however, the ALR continues to be threatened by urbanization and the land development industry. Since its inception, critics of ALR policy claimed that ALR restrictions prevented profit-taking by landowners, especially in British Columbia's rapidly-growing Lower Mainland region, where in the early 21st century, land prices are among the highest in North America. The claim is also made that owners of land in the ALR are not sufficiently compensated for their property and that it constitutes unreasonable interference in private property rights. Critics also claim that the Agricultural Land Reserve has both inflated property values and created a severe housing shortage throughout British Columbia and that much of the poverty caused in British Columbia is a result of regressive land use policies. Many ALR property owners, especially those closer to urban areas, where commercial real estate prices are higher, maintain vacant lots in anticipation of zoning changes, as the ALR does not stipulate that the land must produce, agriculturally-speaking. However, media reports still indicate that the ALR has widespread popularity among British Columbia voters. There has been criticism of inconsistency in how policies are applied, In one instance, a farmer was forced to produce alcohol for a restaurant to stay open. Defenders of the ALR respond that the province has little arable land, especially of such productivity as exists on the Fraser River delta around Vancouver, and that the ALR protects British Columbia's important agriculture sector. They also suggest that a large part of the Lower Mainland's development pressure comes from the lack of a unified land use and transportation plan for the Greater Vancouver Regional District and the failure of municipalities to replace sprawl with densification. Finally, they claim that the ALR is a reasonable extension of the government's right to zone land for various uses. They have been distressed in recent years at what they see as the weakening of the policy by the designation of golf courses as \\"agricultural land\\" and the removal of ALR-protected lands for residential, commercial, and industrial development.

Churning is the process of shaking up cream or whole milk to make butter, usually using a butter churn. In Europe from the Middle Ages until the Industrial Revolution, a churn was usually as simple as a barrel with a plunger in it, moved by hand. These have mostly been replaced by mechanical churns. Butter is essentially the fat of milk. It is usually made from sweet cream. In the USA, Ireland, the UK and the Nordic countries, salt is usually added to it. Unsalted (sweet) butters are most commonly used in the rest of Europe. However, it can also be made from acidulated or bacteriologically soured cream. Well into the 19th century butter was still made from cream that had been allowed to stand and sour naturally. The cream was then skimmed from the top of the milk and poured into a wooden tub. Buttermaking was done by hand in butter churns. The natural souring process is, however, a very sensitive one and infection by foreign microorganisms often spoiled the result. Today's commercial buttermaking is a product of the knowledge and experience gained over the years in such matters as hygiene, bacterial acidifying and heat treatment, as well as the rapid technical development that has led to the advanced machinery now used. The commercial cream separator was introduced at the end of the 19th century, the continuous churn had been commercialized by the middle of the 20th century.  The creation process  Butter churner pot A barrel-type butter churn. Changing whole milk to butter is a process of transforming a fat-in-water emulsion (milk) to a water-in-fat emulsion (butter). Whole milk is a dilute emulsion of tiny fat globules surrounded by lipoprotein membranes that keep the fat globules separate from one another. Butter is made from cream that has been separated from whole milk and then cooled; fat droplets clump more easily when hard rather than soft. However, making good butter also depends upon other factors, such as the fat content of the cream and its acidity. The process can be summarized in 3 steps: # Churning physically agitates the cream until it ruptures the fragile membranes surrounding the milk fat. Once broken, the fat droplets can join with each other and form clumps of fat. # As churning continues, larger clusters of fat collect until they begin to form a network with the air bubbles that are generated by the churning; this traps the liquid and produces a foam. As the fat clumps increase in size, there are also fewer to enclose the air cells. So the bubbles pop, run together, and the foam begins to leak. This leakage is called buttermilk. # The cream separates into butter and buttermilk. The buttermilk is drained off, and the remaining butter is kneaded to form a network of fat crystals that becomes the continuous phase, or dispersion medium, of a water-in-fat emulsion. Working the butter also creates its desired smoothness. Eventually, the water droplets become so finely dispersed in the fat that butter’s texture seems dry. Then it is frozen into cubes, then melted, then frozen again into bigger chunks to sell.  Types of butter churns  Butter churns have varied over time as technology and materials have changed. Churn with plunger Ethnographic Museum of Western Liguria, Cervo, Italy # Butter was first made by placing the cream in a container made from animal material and shaking until the milk has broken down into butter. Later wood, glass, ceramic or metal containers were used. # The first butter churns used a wooden container and a plunger to agitate the cream until butter formed. # Later butter churns used a container made from wood, ceramics or galvanized (zinc coated) iron that contained paddles. The hand-turned paddles were moved through the cream quickly, breaking the cream up by mixing it with air. This allows the butter to be made faster than by simply agitating the cream. # Centrifugal cream separators allow the properties of centrifuge to be applied to butter making. Instead of having spinning paddles, the paddles are fixed and the container spins. This allows better separation of the butter from the buttermilk and water. Small batches of butter can be churned at home by hand with the use of a decent-sized container, such as a Mason jar. With electric mixers and food processors commonly available in most household kitchens, people can make butter in their own homes without a large churn. These small appliances are used to mix the cream until it is close to forming solid butter. This mixture is then mixed by hand to remove the buttermilk and water.

Basic city services may include sanitation (both sewer and refuse), water, streets, the public library, schools, food inspection, fire department, police, ambulance, and other health department issues and transportation. City governments often operate or contract for additional utilities like electricity, gas and cable television. Mumbai even provides a lighthouse service. The available municipal services for any individual municipality will depend on location, history, geography, statutes and tradition. Provided services may vary from country to country or even within a country. Services may be run directly by a department of the municipality or be sub-contracted to a third party. Funding Funding for the services provided varies with the municipality in question. Funding can include tax revenue (property tax, income tax, municipal sales tax), fees (such as building permits), Grants from other Governments, fines such as speeding or parking violations, usage fees for optional services, or other sources such as profits from municipally owned or operated utilities. Probably the greatest influence is the country in which the municipality is located. In the UK, a combination of local taxation based on property value and central government grants is the main means of funding core services. This is supplemented by nominal fees for services provided (e.g. leisure facilities). For some services, a competitive fee is charged compared to commercial concerns that which allows a profit to be made. For other services, full commercial rates may be charged with municipally owned utilities or commercial property, for example. For the most part, services will be part subsidized by the municipality or fully subsidized by the municipality. In recent years, UK councils have been given some leeway in finding alternative funding which can be the simple sponsorship of flower baskets to the trading of surplus buildings and land for services from private firms. In certain notorious cases, local councils have used council funds to speculate on the money markets. Municipalities in other countries may have other methods of funding (e.g. local income taxes or even from the profits of utilities or industrial concerns fully owned by the municipality). United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, until their abolishment, Municipal Corporations were powerful organizations. In their Victorian heyday, with the growth of urbanization and industrialization, they could be responsible for the promotion, organization, funding, building and management of everything from housing to water supplies, power in the form of both gas and electricity, to the introduction of electric trams; almost any activity that the city fathers thought was necessary to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their municipality. However, special powers needed to be granted through Local Acts in Parliament (for example, the Manchester Corporation Waterworks Act needed for the construction of Manchester's reservoirs). As times changed, the Municipal Corporations continued to try to advance the cause of their municipalities. For example, in the 1930s aviation was the new technological frontier and municipalities worked to promote themselves with the development of municipal airports. For the most part, UK municipalities lost their in- house utilities to the nationalisation and centralisation of public utilities. One notable exception is Kingston upon Hull, which still has a municipally- owned telephone company known as Kingston Communications. One trend in the UK, (in the name of efficiency) has been the privatisation of departments, the transfer of staff and assets to the new organisation and the contracting with the new organization for services to the council. This model has been used for services from road cleaning to social housing, to leisure facilities, though no council yet seems to dare to do so for more high-profile services such as schools and social services. In the UK, fire and police services are not under direct municipal control, even when a force can be closely identified with a specific municipal area such as Greater London. However, fire and police services are in part paid for by a surcharge to local taxation, and although they have no say in operational matters, local government appoints members to a committee to oversee the running of each force. Geography Where there is a substantial industrial urban population isolated from other conurbations, or when and where the growth in demand is so great that it becomes uneconomic or impractical for commercial organisations to provide, the municipalities concerned may assume functions necessary for the growth and functioning of the city. This was the case in Victorian England also today in Mumbai, for example, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport are the major municipal organizations which are needed to allow the city to function. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is a legacy of Los Angeles, which found itself in a similar position of rapid growth at the beginning of the last century. The similarly isolated Johannesburg has chosen to run its services as standalone and self-funding, corporate entities. See also *Infrastructure *Municipalization *Urban secession *cf.

He had the Lex Baiuvariorum compilation edited, the first ancient Germanic law collection of the Bavarians. Odilo by his Agilolfing descent was an Alemannic nobleman, a son of Duke Gotfrid (d. 709) whom he succeeded in Thurgau until 736, when with the death of Hugbert of Bavaria the older line of the dynasty became extinct and he inherited the rulership of the Duchy of Bavaria. Odilo presided over the establishment of bishoprics in Bavaria in 739, when the four dioceses of Regensburg, Freising, Passau, and Salzburg were established by St. Boniface, who in 741 also founded the Diocese of Würzburg in adjacent Franconia. His measures sparked a revolt by Bavarian nobles and the duke temporarily had to seek refuge at the court of the Frankish Mayor of the Palace Charles Martel. In 741, Odilo married Charles Martel's daughter Hiltrud, but upon the death of her father found himself at war with her brothers Carloman and Pepin the Short. He was finally defeated in 743 and had to accept Frankish overlordship over Bavaria, but remained duke. He further consolidated his rule, when he came to the aid of Prince Boruth of Carantania against repeated Avar incursions and was able to vassalize the Slavic principality in the southeast. After his death in 748, Grifo, a younger son of Charles Martel and half- brother of Odilo's widow Hiltrud, sought to establish his own rule in Bavaria and abducted Odilo's son Tassilo III. However, the next year he was defeated by Pepin the Short who installed seven-year-old Tassilo III as Duke of Bavaria. Odilo is accepted as the founder of the abbeys of Benediktbeuern (in 739), Niederaltaich (741), and Mondsee (748), as well as a number of others. He was buried at Gengenbach Abbey in Alamannia.

Today most dye is synthetic, but natural dye from I. tinctoria is still available, marketed as natural coloring where it is known as tarum in Indonesia and nila in Malaysia.

It may be an annual, biennial, or perennial, depending on the climate in which it is grown. It has light green pinnate leaves and sheafs of pink or violet flowers. The plant is a legume, so it is rotated into fields to improve the soil in the same way that other legume crops such as alfalfa and beans are. Dye is obtained from the processing of the plant's leaves. They are soaked in water and fermented in order to convert the glycoside indican naturally present in the plant to the blue dye indigotin.

She had been raised in France, where her father held the dukedom of Nevers prior to inheriting the Italian duchy. He was embarrassed financially, she by scandalous pursuit of a cousin who had repudiated her to wed another, and both by a connection forbidden by their warring faiths, thus they married in secret. But Edward's prompt conversion vindicated the couple at the French royal court, despite his mother's threats to disown any of her children who embraced the Catholic Church. The couple took up residence in Paris, where they were referred to as the Prince and Princess Palatine, her inheritance and the king's generosity enabling them to live according to their rank as princes étrangers. Elizabeth soon resumed correspondence with her son. In 1649 he received England's Order of the Garter.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh (editor). Burke's Guide to the Royal Family, Burke's Peerage, London, 1973, p. 207. Edward and Anna Gonzaga were parents of three daughters: # Luise Marie (23 July 1647 – 11 March 1679). Married Charles Theodore, Prince of Salm; # Anne Henriette (23 July 1648 – 23 February 1723). Married Henri Jules, Prince of Condé, had issue; # Benedicta Henrietta (14 March 1652 – 12 August 1730). Married John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Prince Edward died in Paris on 13 March 1663, aged 37. If Edward had not converted to Catholicism, it is possible that the English throne would have been inherited by his descendants rather than those of his Protestant younger sister, Sophia, Electress of Hanover.

It was written by Maurice Richlin and Blake Edwards. It is the first installment in The Pink Panther franchise. Its story follows inspector Jacques Clouseau as he travels from Rome to Cortina d'Ampezzo to catch a notorious jewel thief known as \\"The Phantom\\" before he is able to steal a priceless diamond known as \\"The Pink Panther\\". The film stars David Niven, Peter Sellers, Robert Wagner, Capucine and Claudia Cardinale. The film was produced by Martin Jurow and was initially released on December 18, 1963 in Italy followed by the United States release on March 18, 1964, it grossed $10.9 million worldwide. It was positively reviewed and has a 90% approval rating based on 31 votes on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2010, the film was selected to be preserved by the Library of Congress as part of its National Film Registry, being deemed \\"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\\" Plot As a child in Lugash, Princess Dala receives a gift from her father, the Maharajah: the \\"Pink Panther\\", the largest diamond in the world. This huge pink gem has an unusual flaw: by looking deeply into the stone, one perceives a tiny discoloration resembling a leaping panther. Twenty years later, Dala (now played by Claudia Cardinale) has been forced into exile following her father's death and the subsequent military takeover of her country. The new government declares her precious diamond the property of the people and petitions the World Court to determine ownership. However, Dala refuses to relinquish it. Dala goes on holiday at an exclusive ski resort in Cortina d'Ampezzo. Also staying there is English playboy Sir Charles Lytton (David Niven)--who leads a secret life as a jewel thief called \\"the Phantom\\"-- and has his eyes on the Pink Panther. His brash American nephew George (Robert Wagner) arrives at the resort unexpectedly. George is really a playboy drowning in gambling debts, but poses as a recent college graduate about to enter the Peace Corps so his uncle continues to support his lavish lifestyle. On the Phantom's trail is French police detective Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers), whose wife Simone (Capucine) is having an affair with Sir Charles. She has become rich by acting as a fence for the Phantom under the nose of her amorous but oblivious husband. She dodges him while trying to avoid her lover's playboy nephew, who has decided to make the seductive older woman his latest conquest. Sir Charles has grown enamored of Dala and is ambivalent about carrying out the heist. The night before their departure, George accidentally learns of his uncle's criminal activities. During a costume party at Dala's villa in Rome, Sir Charles and his nephew separately attempt to steal the diamond, only to find it already missing from the safe. The Inspector discovers both men at the crime scene. They escape during the confusion of the evening's climactic fireworks display. A frantic car chase through the streets of Rome ensues. Sir Charles and George are both arrested after all the vehicles collide with one another in the town square. Later, Simone informs Dala that Sir Charles wished to call off the theft and asks her to help in his defense. Dala then reveals that she stole the diamond herself, to avoid turning it over to the new government of her homeland. However, the Princess is also smitten with Sir Charles and has a plan to save him from prison. At the trial, the defense calls as their sole witness a surprised Inspector Clouseau. The barrister (John Le Mesurier) asks a series of questions that suggest Clouseau himself could be the Phantom. An unnerved Clouseau pulls out his handkerchief to wipe the perspiration from his brow, and the jewel drops from it. As Clouseau is taken away to prison, he is mobbed by a throng of enamored women. Watching from a distance, Simone expresses regret, but Sir Charles reassures her that when the Phantom strikes again, Clouseau will be exonerated. Sir Charles invites George to join them on the Phantom's next heist in South America. Meanwhile, on the way to prison, the Roman police express their envy that Clouseau is now desired by so many women. They ask him with obvious admiration how he committed all of those crimes; Clouseau considers his newfound fame and replies, \\"Well, you know... it wasn't easy.\\" The film ends after the police car carrying Clouseau to prison runs over a traffic warden--the cartoon Pink Panther from the animated opening credits. He gets back up, holding a card reading THE END.

Production The film was \\"conceived as a sophisticated comedy about a charming, urbane jewel thief, Sir Charles Lytton\\". Peter Ustinov was \\"originally cast as Clouseau, with Ava Gardner as his faithless wife in league with Lytton\\". After Gardner backed out because The Mirisch Company would not meet her demands for a personal staff, Ustinov also left the project, and Blake Edwards then chose Sellers to replace Ustinov. Janet Leigh turned down the lead female role, as it meant being away from the United States for too long. The film was initially intended as a vehicle for Niven, as evidenced by his top billing. As Edwards shot the film, employing multiple takes of improvised scenes—it became clear that Sellers, originally considered a supporting actor, was stealing the scenes and thus resulted in his continuation throughout the film's sequels. When presenting at a subsequent Academy Awards ceremony, Niven requested his walk-on music be changed from the \\"Pink Panther\\" theme, stating, \\"That was not really my film.\\"Neal Gabler, opening comments from Reel Thirteen, WNET-TV. The film was shot in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Rome and Rocca di Papa; Paris, France; and Los Angeles, U.S., using the Technirama process in an aspect ratio of 2.20:1. According to the DVD commentary by Blake Edwards, the chase scene at the piazza (filmed at Piazza della Repubblica in Rocca di Papa) was an homage to a similar sequence 26 minutes into Alfred Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent (1940). Fran Jeffries sang the song \\"Meglio stasera (It Had Better Be Tonight)\\" in a scene set around the fireplace of a ski lodge. The song was composed by Henry Mancini, with English lyrics by Johnny Mercer and Italian lyrics by Franco Migliacci. Reception The movie was a popular hit, earning estimated North American rentals of $6 million. Please note this figure is rentals accruing to distributors not total gross. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, \\"Seldom has any comedian seemed to work so persistently and hard at trying to be violently funny with weak material\\"; he called the script a \\"basically unoriginal and largely witless piece of farce carpentry that has to be pushed and heaved at stoutly in order to keep on the move.\\" Variety was much more positive, calling the film \\"intensely funny\\" and \\"Sellers' razor-sharp timing ... superlative.\\" In a 2004 review of The Pink Panther Film Collection, a DVD collection that included The Pink Panther, The A.V. Club wrote: > Because the later movies were identified so closely with Clouseau, it's easy > to forget that he was merely one in an ensemble at first, sharing screen > time with Niven, Capucine, Robert Wagner and Claudia Cardinale.

The film holds an approval rating of 88% on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 7.32/10. The website’s critical consensus says: “Peter Sellers is at his virtuosically bumbling best in The Pink Panther, a sophisticated caper blessed with an unforgettably slinky score by Henry Mancini.”. The American Film Institute listed The Pink Panther as No. 20 in its 100 Years of Film Scores. Soundtrack The soundtrack album was released on RCA Victor, and consisted of music composed, conducted, and arranged by Henry Mancini, performed by his orchestra. In 2001, the soundtrack album was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. In 2005, the score was listed at #20 on AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores. The distinctive tenor saxophone of Plas Johnson is heard on the main title theme music. =Track listing= See also * List of American films of 1963 References Notes Further reading * External links  * * Category:1963 films Category:1960s heist films Category:American films Category:American heist films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Blake Edwards Category:Films scored by Henry Mancini Category:Films set in Italy Category:Films shot in Italy Category:French- language films Category:German-language films Category:Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Category:Italian-language films Category:The Pink Panther films Category:United Artists films Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:1960s police comedy films Category:Films with screenplays by Blake Edwards Category:1963 comedy films ","title":"The Pink Panther (1963 film)"},{"id":"2609177","text":"Heheng () is a village in Jiangyan city, China.

For example, lighting, audio or special effects equipment. ACN is maintained by Entertainment Services and Technology Association and its first official release was ANSI Standard E1.17-2006 - Entertainment Technology - Architecture for Control Networks. The standard was subsequently revised and released as ANSI E1.17-2010. ACN was initially designed to be layered on top of UDP/IP and therefore will run over most IP transports including standard, inexpensive Ethernet and 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks. Protocol architecture ACN defines a common protocol architecture, two major network protocols (SDT, DMP), a device description language (DDL) and a number of ‘E1.17 Profiles for Interoperability’ (known as EPIs or interoperability profiles) which define how elements of the ACN architecture must be used in a particular context to achieve interoperability. For example, by providing specific values or ranges for timing parameters to be used in a particular network environment. The breakdown of ACN into sub- protocols, interoperability profiles and other small pieces has been criticized as making ACN hard to read and understand but it makes the architecture highly modular and cleanly layered and this has allowed many of the pieces to be operated in other contexts or replaced or revised without changing the other pieces. For example, DMP has been operated over TCP as well as over SDT as defined in the initial standard, DDL has been adapted with little change to describe devices accessed by DMX512 (ANSI E1.31/Streaming ACN), and several interoperability profiles have seen major revision or replacement without disturbing the other parts of the standard. =Common Architecture= The common architecture specification defines a format of nested protocol data units (PDUs), rather similar to TLV encoding, which are used in the main protocols. It then defines how a minimal Root Layer Protocol is used to splice the higher level protocols into a lower level transport and defines such a Root Layer Protocol using the PDU format for use on UDP/IP. =Session Data Transport= Session Data Transport (SDT) is a reliable multicast transport protocol which operates over UDP/IP which can be used to group peers within a network into sessions and deliver messages to them individually or as a group. Messages delivery is ordered and messages may be selectively sent reliably or unreliably on a message-by-message basis (reliability is very important for some data while avoiding the time and resource overhead of the reliability mechanism is beneficial for others). The reliability mechanism also provides online status so a component will detect when a connection is broken. SDT provides a high degree of fine tuning over the trade-off between latency, reliability levels and resource requirements and availability of large numbers of concurrent sessions means they are a powerful tool for grouping and managing components whose functions are related or whose communication requirements are similar. =Device Management Protocol= Device Management Protocol (DMP) represents any device as a set of addressable properties which represent its current or desired state. Monitoring or control by a controller is achieved by setting or examining the values of those properties. To avoid the inefficiencies of polling, in addition to simply reading property values (using a Get-Property message) DMP provides a subscription mechanism whereby a device will asynchronously send event messages to all subscribed controllers when the value of a property changes. DMP expects that its connections can provide reliability so that Set- Property and Event messages which form a large part of the operational bandwidth in a show situation do not require explicit acknowledgement at the DMP level. In the E1.17 standard and the majority of systems SDT provides this reliability but DMP has also been operated using TCP to provide its reliable connections. The size in bits, representation, read/write accessibility and function of each property in a DMP device is not determined by the protocol which only defines the mechanism to read and/or write the property value. Instead, that information must either be provided externally by a device description written in DDL or in limited cases may be pre-programmed by fore- knowledge of specific device types. =Device Description Language= Device Description Language (DDL) allows a machine parsable description of the interface and capabilities of any device to be defined.http://engarts.com/ddl/index.html This description can be interpreted by a controller which may then automatically configure itself for controlling that device. The description not only provides the address and property mapping information which is necessary for DMP to operate but it can also contain a huge amount of information on the functionality, capabilities and semantics of the device in an extensible format which allows a controller to extract the features it needs for its specific context while skipping over information which is not relevant to its needs. DDL is an XML based language and descriptions are contained in a small number of XML documents. In normal ACN systems the description for a device may be downloaded from the device itself. However, descriptions may also be distributed in other ways (such as internet download) and since a description is valid for all devices of the same type, controllers can typically maintain a cache of descriptions for devices they commonly encounter. =Interoperability profiles= Interoperability profiles (EPIs) are provided in ANSI E1.17 for initial service discovery in a system; for allocation of multicast addresses when used on UDP and IPv4; for UDP port allocation when multicasting, for IP address assignment in conformant systems, for protocol timeouts in specific environments and so on. Other EPIs which conform to the ACN Architecture have been developed outside the ANSI E1.17 standard (see below). External extensions Due to its modular nature ACN has been easy to extend. A major protocol ANSI E1.31 known as Streaming ACN or sACN was developed by the same organization and uses the Root Layer and PDU format of ACN to transport the data of DMX512 data over IP networks (or any other ACN compatible transport). A number of further Interoperability Profiles have been developed and standardized by PLASA. These include: ANSI E1.30-3-2009 Time Reference in ACN Systems Using SNTP and NTP ANSI E1.30-4-2010 which defines how to use DDL to describe devices controlled using DMX512 or Streaming ACN Implementations An early open-source implementation of ACN was released as OpenACN and is available on SourceForge. This has been ported to a wide range of platforms, but it is limited in its scope and does not implement any DDL support. A more recent and much more complete implementation in C is 'Acacian,' which includes more features and DDL support. There is yet another open source ACN project on Codeplex which is implemented in C#. This aims to provide a full managed code implementation and includes code for several other related protocols. E1.31 (Streaming DMX over ACN) is supported on Linux (ARM, i386, x86-64) and Macintosh (PowerPC; i386, x86-64) by the Open Lighting Architecture. A Rust implementation of E1.31 can be found on GitHub. ACN has been deployed in proprietary implementations by a number of companies, including its use by Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC) as the basis of their 'NET3' branded networked control infrastructure and by Shure Inc. in control of wireless microphones.

Nicknamed \\"the Miz\\", he also had a brief turn as professional snooker player. He was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.  Early life  Mizerak, a lefty, began playing pool under the guidance of his father, who for many years had been the New Jersey State Champion. At the age of 13, he won the Perth Amboy City Championship and turned professional. The next year, he was refused entry into that event; they said he was too good. The 1960s saw a downturn for the so-called \\"world pool tournaments\\", and as they diminished, the era of the Johnston City Hustlers tournaments were growing. By this point in his life, Mizerak decided it would not be possible to earn a living playing and went on to attend Athens College in Athens, Alabama.\\"Steve Mizerak\\", page 7, The National Billiard News, November 1980. Retrieved May 20, 2007 He earned a teaching degree from Athens College and taught school for thirteen years before he became famous outside of pool circles after appearing in a humorous commercial for Miller Lite beer in which he executed three complicated shots (which took more than 100 \\"takes\\"), then proclaimed that you can \\"really work up a thirst, even when you're just showing off\\", and later had a brief cameo in the 1986 film The Color of Money for which he also devised the \\"plays\\" seen onscreen.Colour of Money film credits Foray into snooker Mizerak played in a series of snooker and pool challenge matches in 1987 and 1988 – rare televised examples of Mizerak playing snooker – against two of the top snooker players in the world, Steve Davis (a World Snooker Champion) and Jimmy White. The format, which was a best of three legs out of straight pool (14.1), nine- ball, and snooker, meant that Mizerak was the heavy favorite due to his opponents' unfamiliarity with pool. Although, predictably, he lost the snooker legs heavily, he won both pool legs, and so his record includes wins over Davis and White.New York Times - Snooker Debut Won by U.S. In the 1987 event, Mizerak lost more s at both straight pool and nine-ball than Davis did at snooker, but due to the \\"best of three\\" format, Mizerak was the overall winner, despite losing heavily to Davis by 5 frames to 1 in the snooker leg, with Mizerak winning the one frame after Davis went on the final , which made it numerically impossible for him to win that frame. Confusion about the rules occurred on both sides. Mizerak's unfamiliarity with snooker mirrored Davis's with pool, as demonstrated by Davis, together with referee Len Ganley, having to explain to a confused Mizerak that he had actually won a snooker frame, despite Davis potting the pink ball. Davis, who at one point had to rely on Mizerak for an explanation of the rules of pool mid-game, adapted quickly to the smaller table and more forgiving s, but was let down by his lack of knowledge of the rules, which left him at an disadvantage in tactical situations, such as deliberately playing a , which in snooker is strictly prohibited. In Mizerak's words, \\"[Davis] makes every ball on the table but there were times when he didn't know what to do, and if he had, he could have tied me up in knots, instead of me tying him up in knots.\\"Post-straight-pool and post-tournament interviews with Steve Mizerak and Steve Davis, on The Fiat Snooker Pool Challenge, 1987, VHS home video. This foray into each other's sports saw Mizerak adapt less successfully, and struggle to make (snooker term: ) on the larger snooker table with its less forgiving pocket s, though he displayed straight and accurate shooting from a distance. Mizerak observed, referring to the size of the table which he nicknamed the \\"football field\\" and the extra amount of walking necessary: \\"I see why the snooker players are so thin over there [i.e., the UK]; I couldn't see the end of the table.\\" whilst explaining that he wore spectacles except when actually playing. \\"I've been playing so long I do it by instinct\\" he said. After the snooker leg was completed, Davis agreed with the interviewer that he hadn't performed to his usual standards, playing in a far more carefree manner than his usual match game. Mizerak then stated: \\"I would hate to see him at his usual standards; I would be scared to death.\\" Mizerak repeated his overall win the following year, this time with Jimmy White as his opponent, but again losing in snooker. Mizerak stated in the post-tournament interview after the match with Davis that he intended to enter the World Snooker Championship, and said he would \\"keep entering until I win.\\" He duly competed in the event in 1988 and 1989, but failed to progress beyond the first round of qualifying on both occasions, losing to low-ranked snooker professionals. In 1988, he was whitewashed 10 frames to 0, and the following year was beaten by 10 frames to 1, before giving up on his snooker ambitions.Guinness Book Of Snooker World Championship Qualifying rounds Match Results  Later life  Mizerak owned and operated pool halls in the West Palm Beach-Lake Park, Florida area during the 1990s and 2000s. He founded the Senior Tour in 1996 for players 50 years of age and older and often hosted Senior Tour events at his pool hall in Lake Park. Mizerak suffered a stroke in 2001 which left him with physical challenges that prevented him from playing pool competitively. He was inducted into the BCA Hall of Fame in 1980.

The fund began investing in 1980 and closed in March 2000.https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/31/business/the-end-of-the-game-tiger- management-old-economy-advocate-is-closing.html It continues to operate today in direct public equity investments and seeding new investment funds. __FORCETOC__ History Julian Robertson, a stockbroker and former United States Navy officer, started Tiger Management in 1980 with $8 million in capital. By 1996, the fund’s assets had increased to $7.2 billion in value. and On April 1, 1996 BusinessWeek carried a cover story written by reporter Gary Weiss, called \\"Fall of the Wizard\\", that was critical of Robertson's performance and behavior as founder and manager of Tiger Management. Robertson subsequently sued Weiss and BusinessWeek for $1 billion for defamation. The suit was settled with no money changing hands and BusinessWeek standing by the substance of its reporting. With $10.5 billion of assets under management in 1997, it was the second largest hedge fund in the world at the time. Its holdings climbed to $22 billion in 1998. Tiger's largest equity holding at that time was U.S. Airways, whose troubles dragged down the value of his holdings. Such missteps ultimately led him to close his investment company in March 2000https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/31/business/the-end-of-the-game- tiger-management-old-economy-advocate-is-closing.html and return all outside capital to investors. Tiger earlier made $2 billion in gains, but then it gave most of them back during a huge one-day move in the yen in 1998. In September 2001, Robertson distributed 24.8 million greatly devalued U.S. Airways shares over to former investors in Tiger. Robertson declared his intent to keep the stock. U.S. Airways declared bankruptcy in 2002, and shareholders in the airline were wiped out. Aftermath and legacy After closing his Tiger Fund in 2000, Robertson started to use his own capital, experience, and infrastructure to support and finance (\\"seed\\") upcoming hedge fund managers. As of September 2009, Robertson had helped launch 38 hedge funds (\\"Tiger Seeds\\") in return for a stake in their fund management companies. Apart from those Tiger Seeds, a considerable number of analysts and managers Robertson employed and mentored at Tiger Management went out on their own and are now running some of the best-known hedge fund firms, called \\"Tiger Cubs\\", run by Tiger alumni such as Ole Andreas Halvorsen, Chris Shumway, Lee Ainslie, Stephen Mandel, John Griffin, Philippe Laffont, Dan Morehead, David Gerstenhaber, David Goel,, Chase Coleman, Martin Hughes and Paul Touradji. \\"The modern-day emergence of hedge funds can be attributed to a 1986 article in the Institutional Investor highlighting the extraordinary returns of the Tiger Fund. The article spurred investor interest and financing; since that time, hedge funds have increasingly attracted investment and human capital.\\"Stephen M. Davidoff, Black Market Capital, 2008 Colum. Bus. L. Rev. 172 (2008) (citing Julie Rohrer, The Red-Hot World of Julian Robertson, Inst. Inv. 86-92 (May 1986)). The Wall Street Journal reported in June 2010 that Robertson was considering reopening his firm to outside investors. John Townsend, a former partner at Goldman Sachs, was hired as the chief operating officer, and Robertson's son Alex joined the firm. The new hires were part of a potential expansion that could involve creating a \\"seeding\\" fund or a fund of hedge funds for outside investors. According to Institutional Investor magazine, that year many of the Tiger-seeded funds were struggling.

The band Joy Division was initially called Warsaw as a reference to this song. Composition and recording The arrangement is meant to evoke the desolation of Warsaw at the time of Bowie's visit in 1973. The mysterious lyrics and the piece of melody in the middle part of the song are based upon a recording of \\"Helokanie\\" by Polish folk choir Śląsk, although the lyrics are phonetical, not words in Polish. Bowie had purchased a recording of Śląsk performing the piece during a stopover in Warsaw. The piece was developed using many of Eno's spontaneous and deeply experimental techniques, with Bowie choosing the creation of a texture over creating a piece that fit in context with his other songs. Resorting to Eno's techniques of \\"planned accidents,\\" first a click track of 430 clicks was created by hand. From these clicks, a few were selected at random and catalogued. Eno and Bowie would each wait for their randomly selected clicks to sound, which would cue them to play randomly pre-determined chords. When the clicks were removed, the song's basic skeleton of chord changes remained, and the gaps were filled by their writing, with Eno on instrumentals and Bowie on vocals. The result is a suggestive piece in four sections. The first section is sparse and mainly in octaves. Then at 1:17 the harmony fills out and the key changes to F# and the second section - the longest in the piece - starts. At 3:47 there is another striking key change, the texture thins out again and Bowie's vocal part starts. At 5:24 seconds the final section starts and this section basically comprises a repeat of a chunk of the second section. All vocals were composed and performed entirely by Bowie, despite the presence of 110 voices. Eno remarked that despite his tendency to work slowly as his own synthesizer technician, Bowie managed to complete his portion of the track rather quickly, recording all his voices in 20 minutes. Live versions It was used as a live opener on Bowie's Isolar II and Heathen tours. Rather than quickly delving deeply into loud rock music, the song was used to intentionally provoke the audience into a calm, holding them initially in deep suspense. Bowie's choice to maintain a low profile during 1978 was expressed through his entrance to the stage during this song, not singing, but simply sinking into the band and playing the Chamberlin until his cue to sing the lyrics. * A spring 1978 performance of the piece, which opened concerts on the Isolar II Tour, can be heard on Bowie's second live album, Stage, while a summer 1978 performance from the same tour is included on Welcome to the Blackout (2018). * It was performed live in 2002 at the Roseland Ballroom during a performance of the entirety of Low, with the exception of \\"Weeping Wall\\".

As a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, Mayer directed a laboratory that did groundbreaking work on the hypothalamic regulation of obesity and various metabolic disorders. In 1968-69, having worked as an adviser to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, he was appointed principal organizer and chair of the first White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health. At Harvard University, he served as Master of Dudley House before leaving in 1976 to become the tenth President of Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, where he is given credit for having brought about an unprecedented rise in the university's national reputation. He died unexpectedly on January 1, 1993. Early life and education Mayer was born in Paris in 1920 into a distinguished French scientific family. His father, André Mayer, was a celebrated physiologist at the College de France, his mother an outstanding doctoral student in André Mayer's laboratory when they met. Jean Mayer's sister, Dr. Geneviéve Massé would become a Professor of Biostatistics at the French National Superior School of Public Health. Mayer worked in his father's laboratory as a schoolboy, while devoting the greater part of his intellectual energies to mathematics—differential and integral calculus, analytical geometry, series and functions, and theoretical physics. He later made extensive use of mathematical models in his work on the physiology of hunger and nutrition. At age nineteen, he was admitted to the École Normale Superieure as one of only 20 science students from all of France. At the outbreak of World War II, he had earned a bachelor's degree in Philosophy (summa cum laude), a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (magna cum laude), and a master's degree in Physics and Chemistry.Mayer, Jean. \\"My Life as a Physiologist and Nutritionist\\". W.R. Klemm, ed. Discovery Processes in Modern Biology. Huntington, NY: Robert E. Krieger Publishing Co., 1977. World War II With France's declaration of war on Germany in 1939, Mayer enlisted in the Ecole Normale Superieure Artillery Training Unit. In 1940, his was one of the units that provided a protective ring around the British expeditionary force on the beaches during the Dunkirk evacuation, gaining time for the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) across the English Channel. Taken prisoner by the Germans, Mayer shot a guard and managed a narrow escape, making his way to southern France. A Free French sympathizer with a high position in the Vichy government secretly supplied him with a passport and papers permitting his escape to Algeria, Morocco, Martinique and Guadalupe. He would eventually make his way to the United States, where his father, who immediately before the outbreak of war had been invited to give the Lowell Lectures at Harvard, was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with Mayer's mother and sister. On his visit to them Mayer met Elizabeth Van Huysen, who would become his wife. By the end of 1941, Charles de Gaulle had formed the Free French as an army and government in exile. Mayer reenlisted in the Free French Forces, at first serving as a gunnery officer on convoy duty in the North Atlantic. When one convoy was forced back by weather and U-Boat attacks into harbor at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Elizabeth Van Huysen came up to Halifax from Boston and the two were married. They had a honeymoon of less than 24 hours before the convoy sailed again. Mayer would not return to America until 1945.Mayer, Jean. \\"My Life as a Physiologist,\\"177. In North Africa, Mayer served as commander of an artillery battery in the Colonial and Marine First Free French Division that accompanied the British Eighth Army at the second battle of El Alamein, following its victory there with a long advance into Libya and Tunisia. With the Tunisian campaign completed, he was detached to the staff of the War Ministry in Algeria, received training in ship-to-shore attacks and landings, and landed with the First Free French Division—by then part of the U.S. Fifth Army—south of Naples. Mayer had been awarded the Croix de Guerre for his escape from German captivity. At the Battle of Monte Cassino in the Italian campaign, he would be awarded another for risking his life as forward observer of the heavy (155mm howitzer) battalion. After the D-Day landings, he would land in the south of France to command a Free French infantry regiment—made up largely of boys too young to have been drafted for forced labor in Germany and older men who had served in World War I—in the Colmar pocket, managing to hold the line along the Vosges against attack by the elite Hermann Goering SS Division. He would emerge from this campaign with two palms to his Croix de Guerre, the Resistance Medal, and the Legion of Honor, and from the war with 14 decorations in all.Gershoff,\\"Jean Mayer 1920-1993,\\" 1653 Scientific research At war's end, Mayer joined his wife in the United States and received a small grant from the Rockefeller Foundation for graduate work in physiological chemistry. He elected to attend Yale, which had a leading faculty—among them C.N.H. Long, Abraham White, John Fulton, Donald Barron and Desmond Bonnycastle—in his area of interest. Mayer would later recall that, as a military veteran and son of a distinguished French physiologist, he was accepted by the faculty as a junior colleague, being made a member of the Faculty Club and put in charge of the biochemistry laboratory where medical students performed practical exercises. The salary of eighteen hundred dollars turned out to be crucial to his household income when his first son, André, the first of five Mayer children, was born in 1946.Mayer, \\"My Life as a Physiologist,\\" 178. Having earned a Ph.D. in Physiological Chemistry at Yale in 1948 and a Doctor of Science degree in Physiology at the Sorbonne in 1950, Mayer accepted the offer of a Professorship from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1950. He would direct a laboratory in the School of Nutrition there until 1976. Its breakthrough in discovering the physiological bases of hunger and food metabolism would occur when Mayer and one of his graduate students, Norman Marshall, discovered that the body's hunger mechanisms were controlled by the sensitivity of the hypothalamus to glucose under varying conditions. (In technical terms, their discovery was that gold thioglucose, which was known to cause obesity in mice, did so because the gold caused destruction of the ventromedial hypothalamus. Experiments then showed that other substances containing gold components—gold thiomalate, gold thiogalactose, gold thioglycero, etc.—did not have the same effect, suggesting that it was the special affinity of this portion of the hypothalamus for glucose that led first to destruction by the heavy metal and then, as a direct consequence, to obesity due to a failure of appetite regulation.)Mayer, \\"My Life as a Physiologist,\\"184-188. This basic insight would lead, after many more years of research and experimentation, to Mayer's greatest contribution: the so-called glucostatic theory of the regulation of food intake.Gershoff,\\"Jean Mayer 1920-1993,\\" 1652 Public service Mayer's growing reputation as a researcher who was translating the somewhat vague field of nutrition into terms of hard or basic science would lead to numerous invitations to play a role in public policy on matters of nutrition and hunger. During his Harvard years, he would serve as a consultant to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, as the head of a United Nations Task Force on Child Nutrition, as Chair of the U.S. National Council on Hunger and Malnutrition in the U.S.(1968–69)—the now- familiar Food Stamps program would emerge from the Council's findings—Chairman of the First White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health (1969–70), and adviser to many foundations, community action organizations, and scientific societies. He would also become a public voice on \\"popular\\" health and nutrition issues, writing a syndicated column that appeared twice weekly in 100 of the largest newspapers in the United States, with a combined circulation of 35 million readers. A developing interest in higher education, both at the level of institutional policy and of undergraduate and graduate education, led in 1973 to Mayer's accepting an appointment as Master of Dudley House, one of thirteen undergraduate houses built as Harvard's counterparts of the Oxford and Cambridge colleges. In an earlier period, Dudley House had served the needs of Harvard's commuter students. In the wake of the widespread cultural upheaval of the 1960s, it had expanded to become a center of undergraduate life at Harvard, embracing the Dudley Coop—an undergraduate cooperative house or communeKaplan, Amelia Gaia Holland, \\"A History of the Dudley Cooperative House, Harvard University, 1948-1997.\\" Thesis: A.B., Honors in History and Literature, Harvard University, 1998. (Harvard University Archives).—a resident population of undergraduates in Apley Court and Claverly Hall, and a substantial number of students who had chosen to live off campus in Cambridge and environs after a one or two years' experience of dormitory life. Mayer is remembered as having brought with him a sense of energy and excitement, playing a leading role in the development of internal \\"house courses,\\" with classes for Dudley students taught by faculty members of its Senior Common Room, bringing in personal friends such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan and George McGovern as after-dinner speakers at House dinners, and adding faculty from Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health to a Senior Common Room already containing as longtime members such Arts and Sciences faculty as philosopher Nelson Goodman, sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, physicist Robert Pound, ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes, legal scholar Roger Fisher, and topologist Arthur Lee Loeb, who would later succeed John Mayer as Master of Dudley. The House became during Mayer's mastership — remembered for the outstanding Dudley symposium series, folk and jazz concerts, readings by such poets and authors as Anne Sexton and John Updike, a pioneering Film Society whose showings of rare and classic films drew students from across campus, dance recitals and small-cast theatrical productions — a vital center of undergraduate life. Tufts presidency In 1976, Mayer became the tenth president of Tufts University. Few present at his installation ceremony on July 1, 1976, wrote a Harvard friend and colleague who would ultimately join him at Tufts, realized that \\"on that day Tufts University ceased to be a sleepy little school with a good undergraduate program and some very good graduate schools and started to become a first-rate university with an international reputation.\\"Gershoff,\\"Jean Mayer 1920-1993,\\" 1654 Mayer's years at Tufts would become legendary.Gittleman, Sol. An Entrepreneurial University: The Transformation of Tufts, 1976-2002. (Hanover, NH: University Press of New England, 2004). At a school that had suffered from chronic financial deficits and had virtually no endowment, he launched a fund- raising campaign that raised $100 million, followed immediately by a campaign that raised $200 million. Given a faculty that had been lenient in granting tenure, he insisted on distinction in both teaching and research as criteria for promotion and tenure, personally reading tenure files on every case that came up in the university during his presidency.Gittleman,77-78. Mayer arrived at Tufts after a long decline in applications, at a point when admissions had essentially become non-selective.Tufts: The Total University in Changing Times, a Report to the President by the University Steering Committee, January, 1973. As news of his presidency spread, applications increased. In his third year in office, 400 students more than the number predicted by the admissions office accepted Tufts' offer of admission, creating a shortage of dormitory rooms. Mayer's solution was to rent a hotel in Harvard Square for four years and run a connecting bus service, explaining to students and parents that this was the best of all possible worlds: a Tufts education and living in Harvard Square.) \\"As the competition to get into Tufts increased, the quality of the students soared. The percentage of incoming freshmen in the top 10% of their freshman class rose from 38% in 1976 to 74% in 1992.\\" The momentum would continue past the period of Mayer's presidency. For the class of 2020, Tufts accepted 2,889 or 14.3% of 20,223 applicants an all-time low. For the matriculating class of 2016, 91% of incoming freshmen ranked in the top 10% of their high school class. While insisting on maintaining the highest quality of undergraduate education, Mayer transformed Tufts into a major research university with, especially, graduate programs and research units in the basic sciences.Gittleman, Sol. An Entrepreneurial University: The Transformation of Tufts, 1976-2002. (Hanover, NH: University Press of New England, 2004), 107-142. During his presidency, he would create the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, the Tufts Center for Environmental Management, and the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, while increasing Tufts' international presence with the Tufts European Studies Center in Talloires, France, housed in the Priory of an 11th-century Benedictine monastery. He would also oversee the creation of the School of Veterinary Medicine on a separate campus in Grafton, Massachusetts, and would create new interconnections between the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts Medical School, and the undergraduate college. After Mayer's death in 1993, a long-time faculty member and Tufts Provost would judge his presidency to have been a time of revolutionary change: > He arrived at Tufts in a time of uncertainty for the university, when the > faculty felt shaken by the events of the 1970s that had left us weakened, > vulnerable, and lacking in the confidence to move forward. There was a sense > of paralysis, as we watched ourselves slip into a kind of frumpy mediocrity, > without the resources or the will to pull ourselves forward. The 1973 self- > study document A Changing University in a Changing Time had said it all: The > next five years will be tough, but the ten years after that will be worse. > This was a feeling shared by everyone in the Tufts community. Then came Jean > Mayer. ... He represented a style of American college and university > presidents who were becoming increasingly rare: the genuine academic leader, > in charge of the intellectual enterprise from start to finish. He was > president of only one institution, for which he was one of a > kind.Gittleman,173-174.

Description Panel beaters repair body work using skills such as planishing and metalworking techniques, welding, use of putty fillers, and other skills. Accident repair may require the panel beater to repair or replace parts of a vehicle. These parts may be made from various metals including steels and alloys, many different plastics, fibreglass and others. The common panel beater will work on everyday vehicles, cars, vans, 4WDs for example. Specialised areas include repairs to motorcycles, trucks and even aircraft. Some panel beaters also work exclusively on vehicle restorations, and do not repair smash work at all. Others may specialise in body customisation such as is seen on hot rods etc. Special equipment examples: *Various hammers and dollies used for planishing. *Body files and flippers. *Assembly tools such as socket sets, screwdrivers and spanners. *Other hand tools like pliers, tin snips, vise grips, punches, chisels, etc. *Hydraulic pushing/pulling devices. *Vehicle measuring and aligning devices, or jigs e.g. *Vehicle lift hoists. *Personal safety equipment such as boots, overalls, safety glasses, welding helmets, gloves, respirators and hearing protection. *Welding equipment – MIG or TIG. *Stud welder for pulling out dents.

The story follows the misadventures of two down-on-their-luck college guys named Alexis \\"Alex\\" Roberts and Sandy Grayson who are thrown out of their college dorm and join an anime club dominated by crazed yaoi fangirls. Plot College roommates Alexis \\"Alex\\" Roberts and Sandy Grayson have been evicted from their dorm after a series of infractions, the latest involving showing lewd anime, and the antics of Sandy's pet hamster, Echiboo. After seeing a flyer for the anime clubhouse AOI House, the two men believed they found the perfect place. However, the two boys soon learn that the clubhouse consists of five crazed yaoi fangirls who have mistaken Alex and Sandy for a gay couple—the flyer having neglected to mention that only girls and gay guys were permitted and the clubhouse's original name was \\"Yaoi House\\", but the \\"Y\\" fell off of the clubhouse's sign. Once the truth is revealed that Sandy and Alex are two straight males, the two boys are allowed to stay because the housing committee has been on AOI House's case to get more members. The girls have some fun with Sandy and Alex in an attempt to turn them into yaoi-lovers, or at least make them the lodge's token gay couple. Characters =Major characters= ; Alexis \\"Alex\\" Roberts : Morgan's \\"yaoi-pet\\", and perhaps the more level-headed between himself and Sandy. He is Sandy's friend and roommate. Along with Sandy, he was kicked out of his dorm because of Sandy's viewing of hentai anime, and the serving of Ramune which Dean Perkins mistook for an alcoholic beverage. It seems that Sandy is in fact Alex's best friend as Alex continues to stand beside Sandy in spite of all the adventures he has faced as a result of just being near Sandy. It also seems he has the exclusive attention of Morgan McKnight, who obviously has a crush on him. At one point in the story the removal of his ponytail makes him look sufficiently like a bishonen to cast a \\"fangirl\\" effect over the female cast. But as soon as a snippet of hair was cut, the effect was broken. Becomes stepbrother to Sandy and half-brother to Angela after his father marries Sandy's mother halfway through the series. Marries Morgan in the epilogue and has three kids with her. ; Sandy Grayson : Sandy is the owner of Echiboo the hamster, and is also Alex's friend and roommate. Between himself and Alex, Sandy seems the larger otaku and is much more immature. Sandy is also the one that Jessica seems the most interested in, as she calls him \\"tiger\\" and teasingly flirts with him. Sandy appears to be a fan of almost all aspects of Japanese culture, or at least the otaku culture as is seen by his drinking of Ramune while viewing anime (he has a Sailor Moon shrine in his room), and likes to imagine different anime scenarios happening in real life. Has a strong dislike of corn after viewing Boku no Sexual Harassment's infamous porn scene involving corn. Becomes stepbrother to Alex and half-brother to Angela due his mother marrying Alex's father. In the epilogue he winds up marrying Maria and has two kids named Helena and Victor. ; Echiboo : Echiboo is Sandy's pet hamster. Morgan calls him a \\"panty hamster\\" because of the critter's obsession with panties. Echiboo seems to have taken a strong liking to Elle, or at least her panties. He is also one of the causes (by taking the Deans toupee) of Sandy and Alex's need to find new lodging, which eventually led them to Aoi House. Morgan likes to put a tiny camera on his head and let him run amuk, getting footage \\"of the ecchi kind.\\" Echiboo's name is a pun of Ebichu, the hamster from the Gainax anime series Oruchuban Ebichu. His name also means \\"Perverted Fart\\" in Japanese, which is appropriate considering his obsession with panties. Has an attraction to Luna-P (who spurns him at first) and defies all laws of science by having a half pig-half hamster offspring with her called Diana. In the epilogue, he becomes a famous movie star thanks to his role in \\"Echibond\\". ; Elle Mathers : The most mature of all the girls and very ill-tempered. She comes from a wealthy family and continually acts upset about having Sandy and Alex as a part of Aoi House. She does wear a very interesting costume shortly after their first arrival however and seems to (barely) mellow down toward them as they become part of daily Aoi House life. She even began to develop a crush on Alex, but those feelings ended when he and Morgan became an item. Elle is on the tennis team. In the epilogue, she becomes an \\"Echi-Bond\\" girl and a successful actress. ; Nina Parker : Nina is the most nonchalant member of Aoi House. She is also seemingly the least concerned about having two straight male housemates, as she at times continues to walk around without her shirt on regardless of the fact that she now has two straight male housemates. She also makes a habit of smoking where she is not supposed to. She is also a member of the swim team and practices synchronized swimming. Adam Arnold stated that Nina is the most \\"macho\\" of the Aoi House girls, and she also has the smallest bust. Nina apparently works at Sandy's and Maria's bookstore in the epilogue, but since she is still a slacker, Helena and Victor seem to do her job for her. This attitude is most likely why they let Sanae drag off Nina from time to time. ; Morgan McKnight : The most energetic of the group, Morgan is a very hyper girl who seems to be on a continual sugar high and loves candy. Morgan has a playful, childlike innocence about her and how she interacts with Sandy and Alex. In her first meeting with them she claims Alex as her \\"yaoi pet\\" and later uses something of Elle's to lead Sandy and Alex on a wild chase that ends in the girl's locker room. Her closest friend who is not an Aoi House member seems to be the mysterious \\"Oniisan\\" who she doesn't seem to hesitate in telling her secrets, almost as she would to a diary. Morgan also continues to demonstrate, both in her actions and what she tells her \\"Oniisan\\", a very strong attraction to Alex. She is much less energetic when talking to her confidant. She and Alex ultimately start dating in the finale, and they get married in the epilogue with three kids named Timothy, Harley and Ivy. However, married life doesn't entirely take away her mischievous side, as she buys her young son yaoi manga, much to Alex's chagrin. ; Jessica Kim : Jessica is a Korean-American medical student often found wearing her nurse outfit, the subject of Sandy's fetishes. She, along with Morgan, accepts Sandy and Alex joining Aoi House. Jessica is almost as playful as Morgan and joins in on one of hers schemes while helping to defend the ever hyper Morgan's desire for candy; both of these might be why she seems to be one of the few that can \\"control\\" Morgan. She is very motherly and also teases Sandy, which causes him many a nosebleed. However, she allows Maria and Sandy to hook up during the Con Caper. At this point, she also seems to develop a crush on Mason Blue. She has three little brothers. She achieves her goal of becoming a nurse at Seattle Grace Hospital in the epilogue, where her co-workers and child patients are very fond of her. ; Maria Ortega : Along with Sandy and Alex, Maria is one of the newest members of Aoi House. Of Latina descent, she is a little self-conscious about her uncommonly large bust. She is happy to be in Aoi House, and is friendly toward Sandy and Alex, who once helped her shortly after they all joined. Her parents own a local Mexican restaurant which is a place she uses along with the other members of Aoi House to celebrate the new members. She eventually develops feelings for Sandy, whom she marries and has kids with in the epilogue. They run a bookstore called \\"The Bookcave\\". =Minor characters= ; Oniisan : Somewhat of a mystery for most of the series. \\"Oniisan\\" seems to be the one that provides Morgan with an amazing amount of technological equipment including an \\"Ecchi-cam\\", a camera that can be strapped to Echiboo's head. \\"Oniisan\\" is also possibly Morgan's closest and only true confidant, and has counseled her, and Elle, on their respective attractions to Alex. At the beginning, it was not certain who or what Morgan's Oniisan was, though, Oniisan was eventually revealed in \\"Diary Room Antics\\" to be human. The previous theory was that he was some sort of computer (an obelisk labeled \\"Sound Only\\", a reference to the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion) with various sound and visual links throughout the house. Oniisan means \\"big brother\\" in Japanese, and all the members of Aoi House (and former member Carlo) address him as \\"oniisan.\\" For the majority of the series, Alex and Sandy are unaware of Oniisan's existence, and the girls of Aoi House seem either unwilling or just have neglected to enlighten them. The top half of his face is always hidden; in Aoi House in Love! Vol. 1, he cosplayed as Tuxedo Kamen of Sailor Moon, so his eyes would be hidden; he later judges a cosplay battle between Aoi and Uri Houses and the UASOS Brigade wearing sunglasses. It has recently been revealed that Oniisan is actually Elle's brother and that his real name is Jacob. As it turns out, he is the one behind Aoi House's creation, whereas Carlo just pitched the idea to him after reading one of his flyers. Jacob is apparently the owner of a production company that was looking to make a new reality series, and with Carlo's suggestion, Aoi House came to fruition. He continues his Aoi House series in the epilogue. ; Carlo : Aoi House's homosexual transvestite founder. When Sandy and Alex first meet him/her s/he is dressed as a woman complete with wig and skirt. When the girls arrive and inform them of who Carlo is both Sandy and Alex shockingly learn that the one they thought was a \\"she\\" is in fact a \\"he\\". It is interesting that though they both have never met him/her, s/he clearly knows about them, indicating that the girls of Aoi House still keep close contact with their former founder. Carlo's face has stereotypical macho qualities. S/he also finds Alex very attractive and went on a date with him when Alex lost a bet. S/he winds up dating a silent boytoy named Rocky, whom s/he ultimately marries in the epilogue. ; Mr. Perkins : Dean of the University. Echiboo stole Mr. Perkins's toupee, causing Sandy and Alex to search for new housing, which eventually led them to finding Aoi House. He continues to be somewhat of a problem for Sandy and Alex; he keeps a close on eye them because of the trouble they caused in the past. Mr. Perkins can occasionally be found watching the synchronized swim team practice and talking to the swim coach, Ms. Addison. The epilogue just states that he's on the way to a coronary. ; Ms. Addison : Coach of the women's synchronized swim team. Goes on to become an Olympic Swimming Coach in the epilogue. ; David, Daniel and Danny : The little triplet brothers of Jessica. During the epilogue, it turns out that one of them becomes a \\"rebel\\" with black clothes and nail polish, along with a spiked collar and a mohawk, whereas the other two dress in prep school clothes. ; Uri House : Aoi House's rival from Lawndale State University. Their name is based on Yuri, Jessica earlier stating they heard of Aoi House and did a Yuri rip-off. Its current members are: Mason Blue – The de facto leader of the club. While he does not actually have a definite ending in the epilogue, a man with his earrings greets Jessica at Seattle Grace Hospital with a stethoscope around his neck. A hooded boy named Kevin Cardenas – In charge of their AMVs and has a thing for Morgan (calling her \\"McCutie\\") as well as any girl he sees. Moves to Tokyo in the epilogue just for the girls A boy with glasses named Dale Stevens – The club's artist. He gets roped into moving to Tokyo along with Kevin in the epilogue. A girl named Kimberly Ann and her pet pig named Luna-P (A reference of Chibiusa's Luna-P Ball). She goes on to win American Idol numerous time in the epilogue. The open lesbian Sanae – Has a crush on Nina, as well as calling out that Maria's breasts were bigger than Kimberly Ann's. She kissed Nina at one point during the Con Caper, and somehow got both her and Elle into bed (much to their horror when they wake up the next morning) after the epilogue. Publication Aoi House first began as a webcomic written by Adam Arnold and illustrated by Jim Jimenez and initially ran from January 24, 2005 through April 15, 2005. The webcomic was picked up by Seven Seas and was republished with new artwork by Shiei on Seven Seas' Gomanga.com beginning on May 23, 2005. The comic was later serialized in Newtype USA starting with the January 2006 issue. Four graphic novels were published by Seven Seas between May 15, 2006 and June 10, 2008. Release history Related media =Music video= On December 4, 2006, Seven Seas Entertainment released a Flash animated music video dedicated to Aoi House to YouTube, Newgrounds, and Gomanga.com. Aoi House: The Music Video was animated by Jonathan Talas and set to the Aoi House Theme Song – \\"Itsumo Futaride\\" by The J Brothers. The music video received 150,000 views during its first week and was listed on YouTube's \\"Top Favorites (This Week) in Arts & Animation\\". It was also awarded Newgrounds's \\"Daily 2nd Place\\" award in December 2006. The music video was featured on the bonus DVD of April 2007 issue of Newtype USA. =Spin-offs= On March 17, 2010, Seven Seas announced the creation of the comedy manga Paranormal Mystery Squad, an Aoi House spin-off featuring Stephanie and Katie Kane, which will be written by Arnold Arnold and illustrated by Comipa, and will appear as a double-feature with the comedy Vampire Cheerleaders (written by Arnold and illustrated by Aoi House artist Shiei) as Vampire Cheerleaders: Vol. 1. Reception Carlo Santos of Anime News Network stated that Aoi House was a \\"fun, fast reading, much like the comedies it borrows from.\\" However, he criticized the work for \\"[stumbling] in its search for parody.\\" IGNs A. E. Sparrow praised the comic as a must read for anyone who is a fan of harem manga and included Aoi House in the top ten manga of 2006. Matthew Alexander, writing for The Fandom Post, stated that while the artwork was passable, the writing really shines. He enjoyed the humor of having two straight guys living with hot girls who only enjoys anime featuring male homosexuality. PopCultureShock gave Aoi House a positive review, stating that the crazy and perverse female house members is what makes the series so much fun.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. In the episode, Lisa befriends two college students at a gym and attends college with them. Meanwhile, after being bitten by a mosquito from a Chinese-made toy, Bart is infected with the \\"panda virus\\" and is placed in a plastic bubble to prevent others from infection. \\"Little Girl in the Big Ten\\" was directed by Lauren MacMullan and written by Jon Vitti. The episode's main plot was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who thought she was a college student. The subplot was pitched by the Simpsons writing staff, who wanted it to be completely different from the main story. The episode features former three-time U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky as himself. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 6.8 million viewers and finished in 40th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home media release on August 24, 2010, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. Plot Lisa finds herself unable to do any sports in PE class, taught by Brunella Pommelhorst, and finds herself failing physical education. She then signs up to do gymnastics with Coach Lugash. There, she receives encouragement from the ghost of John F. Kennedy in a vision. With boosted self-confidence, and her large head which gives her perfect balance, Lisa passes with flying colors. Lisa also meets two girls and becomes friends with them, but with their fractals and parking permits, she realizes they are college students \\"with small gymnast bodies!\\" They give Lisa a ride home, and she acts like a college student to fit in with them. The two girls invite her to a poetry reading by former Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky soon after. Meanwhile, Bart gets bitten by a Chinese mosquito that was in his Krusty-saurus toy, and becomes infected with \\"Panda virus\\". To prevent others from getting sick, Dr. Hibbert puts Bart in a plastic bubble for the next few days. Bart has trouble adapting to life in the bubble; he has trouble eating and Homer gives him a bath by filling up the bubble with the hose and rolling Bart around the house. Lisa tries to keep up her double life, attending poetry readings at night wearing a beret and falling asleep in her second grade class during the day. While going to Springfield University, she is tracked by Milhouse, Martin, and Database who see her ride away. At a lecture about Itchy & Scratchy cartoons, Milhouse blows Lisa's cover and she flees at being unaccepted by her friends. Lisa tries to convince Homer and Marge that college suits her, but they tell her that college is no place for her at her age. Lisa is also ridiculed by Groundskeeper Willie and all of her friends at school, saying that she is too \\"college for them\\". In the meantime, Bart gets used to his bubble, as it brings him a lot of popularity after he is able to bounce off the attacks from the bullies. Bart tells Lisa what she should do to get her friends back: she has to pull a prank on Principal Skinner. The next day, Chalmers is dedicating the Seymour Skinner parking annex. While Martin takes pictures of Skinner posing next to a giant chocolate cake in his white polyester suit, Bart rolls Lisa, who is inside his bubble, to the edge of the school's roof. He then pushes her over the edge, splattering the cake all over Skinner. Lisa gets her friends back, while Bart goes paranoid after being outside of his bubble for the first time in days. He stays in an air vent, but gets sucked in after fiddling with the air conditioning controls. Production \\"Little Girl in the Big Ten\\" was written by producer Jon Vitti and directed by Lauren MacMullan. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who thought she was a college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was \\"brilliant\\", and the subplot involving Bart in a \\"germ-free\\" plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make \\"the most different subplot from[...] an intellectual college plot\\" they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden. Bart says the line \\"You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me\\", to which Lisa replies \\"That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire.\\" Originally, Lisa's line read \\"[...] that's a plane on fire,\\" however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. \\"[...] since we work so far ahead we usually do these things that are sort of timeless stories,\\" Jean said, \\"but every once in a while there's something that turns out to be ironic in a bad way, then we have to change it.\\" Former poet laureate Robert Pinsky guest starred as himself in the episode. The Itchy & Scratchy cartoon \\"Butter Off Dead\\" was, according to Jean, \\"completely improv[ise]d\\" by director MacMullan. Usually, the episodes are too \\"narrow\\" for there to be any room for improvisation, but MacMullan was an exception, since her improvisations \\"always turned out great\\". The writers came up with the cartoon's title and its \\"template\\", however \\"the way the death proceeded and the different digestion[s]\\" were \\"All Lauren [MacMullan]\\". The sequence in which Pinsky is reading the poem was \\"very hard to do\\", since the animators did not have access to computers at the time. One of the audience members in the scene was designed after staff writer Matt Warburton.Selman, Matt. (2010). Commentary for \\"Little Girl in the Big Ten\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The episode features former poet laureate Robert Pinsky as himself. Pinsky was chosen to guest star because the writers wanted an intellectual reference for Lisa,Jean, Al. (2010). Commentary for \\"Little Girl in the Big Ten\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. and because they knew that Pinsky was a fan of the show, having read an article of The Time in which Pinsky stated that he \\"admired the writing\\" of The Simpsons. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Pinsky stated that he flew to the Simpsons recording studios in Los Angeles on September 10, 2001, and, following the September 11 attacks, was \\"stranded\\" there for four days, since no planes were flying following the attacks. Pinsky enjoyed his stay however; \\"Ian [Maxtone-Graham] and The Simpsons people were very nice to me,\\" he said. \\"... One of the things they did for me is they invited me to a table-read of another episode[...] Thursday the 13th[...] I remember everybody laughed like hell[...] It felt really good. People just went to work and everybody laughed a lot.\\"Pinsky, Robert. (2010). Commentary for \\"Little Girl in the Big Ten\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Pinsky stated that he felt \\"really inept\\" when recording his dialogue. He said: \\"Amongst my friends I'm funny. In that context of Dan Castellaneta... I would say it was like a disaster movie, and I was that character played by Susan Hayward.\\" The poem Pinsky reads in the episode was picked by the Simpsons writing staff, \\"The poem has two jokes in it,\\" Pinsky said, \\"and when I say jokes I don't mean witty remarks. It's more like an optician, the pope and a zebra go into the bar and then there's a punch line at the end.\\" He stated that the poem was \\"an elegy for a friend of mine who liked jokes\\". He added that his appearance on the show gave him \\"a lot more prestige\\" when visiting high schools and colleges. The episode also features Karl Wiedergott as the professor at the Springfield University.Maxtone-Graham, Ian. (2010). Commentary for \\"Little Girl in the Big Ten\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Cultural references The episode's subplot was based on the 1976 television film The Boy in the Plastic Bubble (Lenny also addresses Bart as Bubble Boy in one scene, which was the name of the film's 2001 remake) in which a boy born with an improperly functioning immune system lives out his life in incubator- like conditions. In one of Lisa's college courses, the students are watching an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon titled \\"Butter Off Dead\\". The lecture was a reference to college courses which include The Simpsons episodes in their teachings. The gate to Springfield University was based \\"loosely\\" on the ivy gate at Harvard University. The episode also parodies the British anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba, with Homer singing his own version of their song \\"Tubthumping\\". Release In its original American broadcast on May 12, 2002, \\"Little Girl in the Big Ten\\" received a 6.4 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 6.8 million viewers.

This parasite is able to influence its host's behavior: once the parasite is grown, it causes its grasshopper host to jump into water, where the grasshopper will likely drown. The parasite then leaves its host; the adult worm lives and reproduces in water. S. tellinii does not influence its host to actively seek water over large distances, but only when it is already close to water. The microscopic larvae are ingested by their insect hosts and develop inside them into worms that can be three to four times longer than the host. The precise molecular mechanism underlying the modification of the host's behaviour is not yet known. A study in 2005 indicated that grasshoppers which contain the parasite express, or create, different proteins in their brains compared to uninfected grasshoppers. Some of these proteins have been linked to neurotransmitter activity, others to geotactic activity, or the body's response to changes in gravity. Furthermore, it appears that the parasite produces proteins from the Wnt family that act directly on the development of the central nervous system and are similar to proteins known from other insects, suggesting an instance of molecular mimicry. A similar parasitic worm is Paragordius tricuspidatus. References External links * Video of Spinochordodes tellinii, in which it causes a cricket to drown and then emerges from it.

(Honoel A. Ibardolaza) and was the premiere publication of Seven Seas Entertainment. Blade for Barter, Volume 1, was first printed in February 2005, after extensive previews on the Seven Seas Entertainment homepage. Hai!'s art is based on that of Eiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece. Plot summary Blade for Barter is the story of Ryusuke Washington, a private samurai for hire. He lives in New Edo, a hodgepodge city-state where New York City meets ancient Japan, where monolithic skyscrapers tower over ramshackle wooden huts, and salarymen and samurai walk side by side. Along with his loyal dog Hachiko, Ryusuke must deal with the likes of the corrupt Samurai Union, the Mafuza (a cross between the Italian mafia and the Yakuza); a Ninja Union of clumsy ninja; a sinister Zen monk televangelist, and more - not to mention the temper-tantrum prone Lord Hoseki, who rules New Edo with bejeweled fingers and an iron fist. The world in which Hachiko and Ryusuke find themselves is an eclectic mix of Eastern and Western cultures. Such blending of East and West also is found to typify, Ryusuke Washington himself, a warrior for hire. The side effects of such a mixed culture come back to haunt Ryusuke as he has to face striking ronin who actively demonstrate, their very existence in real Japan would have violated traditional codes. He also has to face the control hungry Samurai union. Ryusuke is soon joined by the cute but over affectionate Hachiko the dog and Mac, a kunoichi who takes a certain obsessive pride in her fuzz boots.

The series is on hiatus with two volumes, however, a third is planned and supposedly on the way. Plot summary Do you believe in alternate dimensions? Ikuko, her friend Colleen, and Alvin at Hawaii's Maunaloa Institute for International Studies become believers when the class hunk, Hiro, confesses to them that he's really a prince from another world on the run from the evil Lord Kumagai! Now that they've been dragged into it, Hiro, Ikuko, and their friends must traverse countless alternate dimensions and survive the terrors they find there or die trying; whether at the hands of the ruthless Lord Kumagai or the alternate dimensions' hostile inhabitants. Characters *Hiroto \\"Hiro\\" Nakadai :An attractive, mysterious Maunaloa Institute for International Studies transfer student who's actually a prince from another world. His uncle, Lord Kumagai, murdered his parents and put the blame on him in an attempt to gain the crown. Now, armed with only a defective piece of dimension-hopping technology from his world, he must escape the pursuit of his murderous uncle and his foot soldiers, by traveling between dimensions searching out salvation or a way to reveal the truth and prove his innocence. He slowly begins to develop feelings for Ikuko during their travels. :Kriss Sison claims that Alvin was the easiest character to develop, giving rise to the inside joke that this is because the illustrator and the character are actually one and the same. *Ikuko :A shy, naive student at Maunaloa Institute for International Studies with a huge crush on Hiro. Colleen is her best friend. She tries her best to be the emotional support for the group when times get rough. Ikuko has an inexplicable bond with Hiccup. :Sison says that Ikuko and Colleen are his favorite characters to draw. *Colleen :An Irish student at Maunaloa Institute for International Studies with a penchant for caffeine. She's very blunt and tomboyish in her mannerisms but also has a special spunkiness that seems to attract much unwanted male attention; two examples being Drake and Alvin. She's somewhat of a realist and doesn't easily accept any of the dimension-hopping concepts, sometimes revealing an inability to cope with large amounts of stress. *Drake :Maunaloa Institute for International Studies student, best friend of Tom's, and he has a huge crush on Colleen. He shows his emotions in an almost bullying way which makes him seem like a bad guy, but he's actually a very loyal man who'd do anything for his friends. *Tom :Maunaloa Institute for International Studies student who's best friends with Drake. At first he's depicted as Drake's lackey, but his character develops into a very loyal friend with a bad temperament. *Alvin :A German student at Maunaloa Institute for International Studies with a genius IQ and a crush on Colleen. He's a very shy and outspoken boy who wants nothing more than to fit in with his fellow students, resulting in purposely average grades despite his above average intelligence. *Lord Kumagai :Hiro's uncle; he killed Hiro's parents and put the blame on Hiro so that he'd be on the run and defenseless. Now, with his army of foot soldiers, he aims to capture Hiro, murder him as well, and claim the throne. *Hiccup :A cute, mysterious creature from Hiro's world with a tendency to hiccup, which is where he got his name. For some reason, he warms up to Ikuko almost immediately. He seems to be perpetually drunk. :Hiccup's design was originally going to be much more serious. Shiei assisted Kriss Sison in developing the Hiccup we know today. *Sturch :The kind and caring principal of Maunaloa Institute for International Studies. While visiting the Alternate School dimension, the group runs into an evil version of him. In that dimension, he is a murderous man who runs his school with an iron fist as well as with iron bars. *Captain Lisbeth Striker :While visiting the Mech World, the gang runs into this woman, who is among the few surviving humans in the year 2324. Given the world she grew up in, she's very rugged and overly trusting of humans. She's cool under pressure and is very skilled at combat both with and without the aid of a mech. *Elizabeth :We meet her very briefly at the end of the second volume when the gang escapes the Mech World. She seems to reside in the Swiss countryside near the city of Bern at the \\"House of Frankenstein\\". She is very sweet and caring, even to strangers. Her clothing and mannerisms lead us to believe that her world exists in the past. Worlds Well over 5,000 worlds have already been mapped out and categorized by the creators of the dimension-hopping devices (Absprung and Himmelskarte) of Hiro's World. Some have been quarantined and others marked for recommendation; research of new worlds continues today. Read the official article, \\"Report on the Sociological and Economic Implications of Trans-Dimensional Travel for Trade and Cultural Exchange\\" for more information on these devices and their dimension-hopping abilities. *Earth :The base world where all the main characters reside. They attend Maunaloa Institute for International Studies in Hawaii; this world is just like ours. *Hiro's World :Where Hiro, Lord Kumagai, and Hiccup originally resided. It can be assumed that it's a world under a monarchy because Hiro is a prince and his uncle is a Lord. Judging by Hiro's knowledge and abilities, it's assumed that intelligence and physical prowess are prized skills here because both Lord Kumagai and Hiro are skilled in combat with and without weapons, though their weapons of choice are swords. (Perhaps a role resembling a samurai is highly regarded or expected of royalty?) The world is also obviously technologically advanced because of the presence of the Absprung and Himmelskarte; dimension-hopping devices. *Alternate School :The first world the gang visits; first-second volume. This world mirrors Maunaloa Institute for International Studies almost exactly, including its students and staff. The difference is that in this world, the school more closely resembles a zero-tolerance prison in which discipline, torture, and taking pleasure in pain is the norm. The school is lined with guards who would kill you soon as look at you, head by a principle who makes examples of delinquent students by murdering them in front of their classmates, and populated by a student body full of fear and hoping for freedom. No one is permitted in or out of the facility. *Mech World :The second world the gang visits; second volume. It's the year 2324 and humanity had discovered life on Mars, only to have that very life they found track them back to Earth. The aliens, named Scavengers, systematically assimilated human technologies and slaughtered humans in waves, leaving mere thousands left who all take residence on the moon in an attempt to escape. Of course, this didn't stop the Scavengers who followed the humans to the moon. Residing in an underground safe haven away from the Scavengers, the humans get to work on their last hope, the Trimech (TMH-1A). *House of Frankenstein :The third world the gang visits; second volume. This world seems to exist in the past somewhere in the Swiss countryside near a city named Bern. Because this world was only introduced for a brief two pages before the epilogue of the second volume, knowledge of this world is limited.

It was used by Vladimir Lenin in his attacks on a trend in the early Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party around the newspaper Rabochaya Mysl and the writer Tony Cliff: The charge of economism is frequently brought against revisionists by anti-revisionists when economics, instead of politics, is placed in command of society; and when primacy of the development of the productive forces is held over concerns for the nature and relations surrounding those productive forces. This debate was most notable upon Deng Xiaoping assuming leadership of the Communist Party of China, criticising the Maoist line as ultra-leftist and accusing them of building socialism before the economy was ready. In turn, Maoists criticised Deng Xiaoping for abandoning socialism in favour of opening up the Chinese economy to capitalist reforms in a needless pursuit of expertise and recognition from capitalist nations to fuel growth.  Other uses  The term is often used to criticize economics as an ideology in which supply and demand are the only important factors in decisions and outstrip or permit ignoring all other factors. It is believed to be a side effect of neoclassical economics and blind faith in an \\"invisible hand\\" or laissez-faire means of making decisions, extended far beyond controlled and regulated markets and used to make political and military decisions. Conventional ethics would play no role in decisions under pure economism, except insofar as supply would be withheld, demand curtailed, by moral choices of individuals. Thus, critics of economism insist on political and other cultural dimensions in society. Old Right social critic Albert Jay Nock used the term more broadly, denoting a moral and social philosophy \\"which interprets the whole sum of human life in terms of the production, acquisition, and distribution of wealth\\", adding: \\"I have sometimes thought that here may be the rock on which Western civilization will finally shatter itself. Economism can build a society which is rich, prosperous, powerful, even one which has a reasonably wide diffusion of material well-being. It can not build one which is lovely, one which has savor and depth, and which exercises the irresistible power of attraction that loveliness wields. Perhaps by the time economism has run its course the society it has built may be tired of itself, bored of its own hideousness, and may despairingly consent to annihilation, aware that it is too ugly to be let live any longer\\".

Via the Gauley, Kanawha and Ohio rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River. The Cherry River drains mostly rural and forested areas and flows for much of its length through the Monongahela National Forest.DeLorme (1997). West Virginia Atlas & Gazetteer. Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. . Throughout its entire length the Cherry goes over a series of whitewater rapids in a mountainous setting. History and geography According to the Geographic Names Information System, the river has also been known historically by the toponyms Cherry Tree Waters and Cherrytree Creek in the past. The present name is for the wild cherry trees along its course. The upper headwaters of the Cherry begin as two separate creeks, the North Fork Cherry River and the South Fork Cherry River, each of which rises in southeastern Pocahontas County and flows generally west-northwestwardly across northern Greenbrier County before converging in Nicholas County at the city of Richwood. Now at an elevation of approximately 2,200 feet above sea level, a unique setting is created by which class 3 whitewater rapids are usually created during spring runoff through a town of about 2,000 residents, viewable from some of the city's public streets. This may be the only place in eastern North America where three categories of \\"twos\\" (population, elevation, and whitewater difficulty) are met or eclipsed. (Western US example-the Sacramento River at Dunsmuir, California) Downstream of Richwood, the Cherry River is paralleled by a rail trail, the Cranberry Tri-Rivers Rail-Trail,West Virginia Rails-to-Trails Council website, reprinted news article about the Cranberry Tri-Rivers Rail-Trail then flows northwest for about 10 more miles to its confluence with the Gauley in Curtin, a nearly abandoned lumber town two miles south of Craigsville. There are currently no dams on the Cherry and the town of Richwood has been subjected to damaging floods, most recently to a \\"50 year flood\\" during the current millennium. Local leaders have proposed a dam be placed on the South Fork just above town, thus protecting it from future flooding and potentially creating more reliable flows for whitewater recreation.

Biography Morgan was born in Greensburg, Decatur County, Indiana, and served as a sergeant in the Union Army in the 123rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. After the war he enrolled in Eastman's Commercial College in Poughkeepsie, New York. After graduation, he traveled to Salt Lake City on business, and decided to permanently relocate there. In 1867 Morgan established the Morgan Commercial College in Salt Lake City, where he tapped a strong interest in business education. He moved the school into larger accommodations several times as enrollment increased. The college provided a number of innovations, including Utah's first free public library, and the first school run by a non-Mormon. The college taught many students that would later rise to prominence in Utah, including Heber J. Grant, Orson F. Whitney, Matthias F. Cowley, and J. Golden Kimball. The college lasted until 1874, when it closed due to intense competition from the University of Deseret (which later became the University of Utah). Although the University of Deseret was founded in 1850, it had been put in a 16-year hiatus until Morgan's success inspired its comeback. On November 26, 1867, Morgan joined the LDS Church and on October 24, 1868 he married one of his former students, Helen Melvina Groesbeck. After the college closed in 1874, Morgan served as a missionary in the Southern States Mission from 1875 to 1877, returning to the mission again in 1878 to become the mission president. During his term as mission president he was involved with attempts to help the Catawba tribe move to the west to be with the rest of the Saints. On October 8, 1884 he became one of the seven presidents of the Quorums of the Seventy, filling the vacancy created by the death of William W. Taylor, son of church president John Taylor. Morgan served as a general authority for the last 10 years of his life. Morgan also became involved in Utah politics, and served a term as a representative to the Utah Territorial Legislature as a Republican in 1883. Morgan died unexpectedly from typhoid-malaria after a two-week convalescence in Preston, Idaho. He was a practicing polygamist, and all three of his wives outlived him. He was arrested on polygamy charges while visiting one of his wives in Manassa, Colorado. One of his widows, Mary Ann Linton (Morgan) was remarried to David King Udall.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. Although made as a pilot episode, the five subsequent episodes had been commissioned and recorded by the time of broadcast, so instead \\"Demolition\\" was promoted to the ordinary first episode of a series, and has remained as so. It was first aired on BBC2 on 9 November 1982. Plot The four dissimilar students attending the fictional Scumbag College go about their day-to-day life in their shared house, which includes a lentil casserole made with Lux washing powder and some of Neil's snot for dinner, and one of several of Neil's suicide attempts. The lentil casserole is spilled on the floor several times during the episode. Vyvyan acquires an amputated human leg from the morgue on which he has to write an essay for anatomy class, though he would prefer to mount it on the bonnet of his Ford Anglia. Balowski visits and admits that he isn't really a foreigner. Vyvyan later announces that they had received a letter from the council, who are planning to demolish their house the next day. Meanwhile, Vyvyan drops his pet hamster in the casserole after it bites his hand. It proceeds to eat all the casserole and blow up to balloon size. Rick then sees two rats and smashes one to death with Neil's guitar. Neil is unhappy as he says the guitar was made by his grandfather out of matchsticks while dying; the living rat proceeds to mournfully eat the remains of his friend. Each character throughout the show's pilot episode has their own plan to fight the council's decision. Rick plans a protest, involving hanging himself from a cross on the front of the house and reading bad poetry from a sheet of paper in his hand, which he drops and thus begins singing Cliff Richard's song \\"Living Doll\\"; Vyvyan begins knocking down the house himself, using extreme methods; Neil has planned to hang himself, but his rope is too long and he can't do it. Neil later plans to hide in the wall cavity and \\"pretend to be thermal insulation\\" so that he will be killed when the house is knocked down; and Mike tries to seduce the female council representative. None of their schemes work, as an aeroplane ultimately crashes on their house instead. Characters As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall) and Neil (Nigel Planer). However, there are several telltale signs of this being the pilot episode - the characters' individual personalities aren't as fleshed out as in later episodes, Rick's outfit is different, and Vyvyan and Rick sport shorter haircuts. The episode also introduces their landlord Jerzei Balowski (Alexei Sayle), a character who would only appear once more during the first series, and twice more in total. Sayle, however, featured in every episode of the dozen made. Ben Elton appears as the host of a BBC2 show called Nozin' Aroun' which is supposed to be for \\"young ad-ults\\"; when Rick watches it he kicks the TV screen in and complains that they are still wearing flared trousers and they are \\"hippies\\".

Some evidence of modernist architecture can be seen in the houses illustrated here, such as the flat roofs, horizontal windows and ship-deck balcony rails. Although most council house building was suspended for the duration of the Second World War, an exception was made in the case of Penilee because of the demand for homes for workers at the numerous armaments factories at Hillington. Shortage of traditional materials meant that many of the wartime flats at Penilee were built of prefabricated materials such as foamslag.Penilee in Wartime (Glasgow City Archives, Department of Architectural and Civic Design, 1942), The Glasgow StoryMaukinfauld Road (Glasgow City Archives, Department of Architectural and Civic Design, 1947), The Glasgow Story New housing at Craigmuir Place The war also caused the cancellation of the 1941 census, but it is likely that wartime saw Glasgow's population reach its highest level as workers flooded in to take jobs in the city's numerous essential industries.

When the Madras cricket league was started in 1932, he played for Chepauk United Club and then switched to Triplicane CC. Here he formed a fearsome partnership with M.J. Gopalan. Rangachari first claimed the spotlight when he took 9 for 45 against Mysore in an inter-association junior match in 1938. The same year he was selected in the Ranji Trophy team. Ranga was also a fine fielder, and fielding usually at silly mid-off, formed a nice combination with the spinner A.G. Ram Singh. He was selected for the tour of Australia in 1947/48. He took a hat-trick in the match against Tasmania. On his Test debut at Adelaide he took 4 for 141, dismissing Neil Harvey, Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall and Ian Johnson. His career best Test bowling was 5 for 107 against West Indies at Delhi. Coming on as the first change bowler, he dismissed Allan Rae, Jeff Stollmeyer and George Headley in his first 19 balls, conceding one run.

February 1917 Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis Railroad bond, 1920, detail The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, commonly called the Pan Handle Route (Panhandle Route in later days), was a railroad that was part of the Pennsylvania Railroad system. Its common name came from its main line, which began at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, crossed the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia, and continued west to Bradford, Ohio, where it split into a northern line to Chicago and a southern one through Indianapolis, Indiana, to East St. Louis, Illinois. History =Pittsburgh to Columbus (1848-69)= The Steubenville and Indiana Railroad was chartered February 24, 1848, in Ohio to build west from the Ohio River at Steubenville to the Indiana state line between Willshire and Fort Recovery, via Mt. Vernon. On March 12, 1849, it was authorized to build a bridge at Steubenville and a branch to Columbus. The first section opened December 22, 1853, from Steubenville west to Unionport. On February 2, 1854, an extension from Unionport west to Cadiz Junction opened; the branch to Cadiz opened June 12. Further extensions west from Cadiz Junction opened June 22 to Masterville, July 12 to Bowerston, and April 11, 1855, the rest of the way to Newark. However, it did not yet connect to any other railroads in Newark. On December 25, 1854, the S&I; came to an agreement with the Central Ohio Railroad to use its tracks from Newark west to Columbus. Some surveying had been done for a separate route via Granville. The connection at Newark opened April 16, 1857, and was built with funds provided by the Columbus and Xenia Railroad, which helped provide a through route to Cincinnati from the S&I.; In 1864, the S&I; outright bought a half interest in the Newark-Columbus track. The Pittsburgh and Steubenville Railroad was chartered March 24, 1849, in Pennsylvania to build west from the Monongahela River near Pittsburgh to the Virginia (now West Virginia) state line towards the Steubenville and Indiana Railroad. It was authorized to extend across the Monongahela to Pittsburgh on April 21, 1852. The Western Transportation Company was incorporated by the Pennsylvania Railroad in Pennsylvania on March 15, 1856, to build and operate the P&S.; On July 22, 1853, the president of the S&I; deeded right-of-way he had bought from 36 landowners across the Virginia Panhandle to the P&S.; This allowed the railroad to build without a charter, which was required to use eminent domain; the powerful city of Wheeling had opposed the P&S;, which bypassed Wheeling. The private Edgington and Wells Railroad (named after its owners, Jesse Edgington and Nathaniel Wells of Brooke County) opened July 4, 1854, but failed later that year, as it did not connect to any other railroads. The Holliday's Cove Rail Road was chartered by the Western Transportation Company on March 30, 1860, in Virginia to build across the Panhandle near what is now Weirton, West Virginia; the charter was only used to build the Steubenville Railroad Bridge. The next day the Wheeling Railroad Bridge Company was chartered by the same company, as a political promise to allow the incorporation of the HCRR. The full P&S; opened October 9, 1865, from Smithfield Street in Pittsburgh west to Wheeling Junction at the east end of the Steubenville Railroad Bridge. That same day, the Steubenville Railroad Bridge opened over the Ohio River, connecting the S&I; and P&S;, as did the connection at Pittsburgh, connecting the Pennsylvania Railroad with the P&S; via the Monongahela River Bridge (commonly called the Panhandle Bridge) and Grant's Hill Tunnel. From then until 1868, the line was operated as the Pittsburgh, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad by the Western Transportation Company. The P&S; was sold under foreclosure on November 6, 1867, to the Panhandle Railway, which had been chartered April 8, 1861. On April 30, 1868, the PHRy, S&I; and HCRR merged to form the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway, and the Western Transportation Company was dissolved soon after. =Columbus to Indianapolis (1847-67)= The Terre Haute and Richmond Rail Road was chartered in 1847 to build across Indiana via Indianapolis. On May 25, 1850, stockholders east of Indianapolis organized the Terre Haute and Richmond Railroad (East of Indianapolis). On January 20, 1851, that section, from Indianapolis east to the Ohio state line, was renamed the Indiana Central Railway. On January 31, an Ohio law authorized the Dayton and Western Railroad to unite with the Indiana Central and operate jointly. The line from Indianapolis east to Greenfield opened in September 1853, and on October 8 it was completed to the state line, where it connected with the Dayton and Western. Joint operation of both lines between Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio began August 1, 1854. In 1859 the rail gauge was changed from standard gauge to the broader Ohio gauge () to allow for direct connections with the Little Miami Railroad and Columbus and Xenia Railroad at Dayton. The Columbus, Piqua and Indiana Railroad was chartered in Ohio on February 23, 1849, to build from Columbus west via Urbana, Piqua and Greenville to the Indiana state line. On March 21, 1851, the CP&I; was authorized to change the route west of Covington, and a more northerly alignment was chosen to meet the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad at Union City, Indiana for access to Indianapolis. The first section, from Columbus west to Plain City, opened June 6, 1853. Extensions opened to Urbana September 19 and Piqua October 16, 1854; on the latter date it changed its track gauge to Ohio gauge () to connect with the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine, which had also re-gauged. The rest of the line to Union City opened March 25, 1859, after some financial problems. The CP&I; was sold at foreclosure on August 6, 1863, and reorganized October 30 as the Columbus and Indianapolis Railroad. The Richmond and Covington Railroad was chartered in Ohio by the Indiana Central Railway and Columbus, Piqua and Indiana Railroad on March 12, 1862, to build a branch of the latter from Bradford to the former at the Indiana state line near New Paris. The R&C; opened in early 1863, and the Indiana Central's joint operating contract with the Dayton and Western Railroad was dissolved on March 9. On January 10, 1864, the IC, C&I; and R&C; signed an agreement for joint operation as the Great Central Line between Columbus and Indianapolis, headed by the Indiana Central. The C&I; bought the R&C; on September 5, 1864. The Indiana Central Railway and Columbus and Indianapolis Railroad merged October 19 to form the Columbus and Indianapolis Central Railway, with a main line from Columbus, Ohio to Indianapolis, Indiana and a branch from Bradford, Ohio to Union City, Indiana. =Richmond to Chicago (1848-65)= The New Castle and Richmond Railroad was chartered February 16, 1848, in Indiana to build a line from New Castle east via Hagerstown and Greens Fork to Richmond. The company was authorized on January 24, 1851, to extend northwest beyond New Castle to Lafayette. On February 26, 1853, it was renamed the Cincinnati, Logansport and Chicago Railway to better reflect its expanded role. The original line opened between New Castle and Richmond in December 1853, and it was operated jointly with the Richmond and Miami Railroad and Eaton and Hamilton Railroad, which continued the line southwest to Hamilton, Ohio. The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad, connecting Hamilton to Cincinnati, joined the operations on February 1, 1854. The Cincinnati, Cambridge and Chicago Short Line Railway was incorporated in Indiana on January 25, 1853, to build from New Castle southeast via Cambridge to the Ohio state line; the Cincinnati, New Castle and Michigan Railroad was incorporated April 11 of the same year to build northwest from New Castle towards St. Joseph, Michigan. The two companies merged May 1, 1854, to form the Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad. On October 10, 1854, the Cincinnati, Logansport and Chicago Railway was merged into the Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad. The unfinished line between Richmond and Logansport was leased to John W. Wright and Company on October 16, 1856. That company began operating it on December 1, and the joint operation towards Cincinnati ended. The full line between Richmond and Logansport opened on July 4, 1857. That line was sold at foreclosure on April 28, 1860, and reorganized July 10 as the Cincinnati and Chicago Air–Line Railroad. Grading had been done from Wabash southeast to the Ohio state line; portions were later sold to the Fort Wayne and Southern Railroad and Connersville and New Castle Junction Railroad. On September 25, 1857, the Chicago and Cincinnati Railroad was chartered in Indiana to build a line from Logansport northwest to Valparaiso. That line opened in 1861, connecting at Valparaiso with the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway to Chicago. The Cincinnati and Chicago Air–Line opened a bridge over the Wabash River at Logansport on September 25, 1861, connecting it to the Chicago and Cincinnati. Joint operation between Richmond and Chicago began July 1, 1862 and ended January 29, 1865. =Realignments towards Chicago and mergers (1857-69)= The Galena and Illinois River Railroad was chartered in Illinois on February 18, 1857, to build from Galena through Chicago to the Indiana state line towards Lansing, Michigan. The Chicago and Great Eastern Railway was incorporated in Indiana on June 19, 1863, to build from Logansport northwest to the Illinois state line towards Chicago. The charter of the G&IR; was assigned to the C&GE; on September 11, 1863, and the C&GE; absorbed the G&IR; on October 30. The line from Chicago (12th Street) south and southeast to the Chicago and Cincinnati at La Crosse, Indiana opened March 6, 1865, and the old line northwest from La Crosse to Valparaiso was abandoned. On May 15, 1865, the C&GE; absorbed the Cincinnati and Chicago Air–Line Railroad and Chicago and Cincinnati Railroad. The Marion and Mississinewa Valley Railroad was incorporated in Indiana on May 11, 1852, to build from Union City northwest to Marion. On May 14, 1853, the Marion and Logansport Railroad was incorporated to continue northwest from Marion to Logansport. The M&L; conveyed its property to the M&MV; on November 28, 1854. The Union and Logansport Railroad was incorporated January 5, 1863, and bought the unfinished M&MV; on January 9. In the meantime, the Logansport and Pacific Railroad was incorporated in 1853 to build from Logansport west to the Illinois state line. After several reorganizations, the Toledo, Logansport and Burlington Railroad opened to the Illinois state line near Effner in 1859. The Logansport, Peoria and Burlington Railroad continued as part of a line to the U.S. West, bypassing Chicago. 1868 map of the Columbus, Chicago and Indiana Central Railway On September 11, 1867, the Columbus and Indianapolis Central Railway, Union and Logansport Railroad and Toledo, Logansport and Burlington Railway merged to form the Columbus and Indiana Central Railway. The main line, formerly being built by the Union and Logansport, opened from Union City to Marion in October 1867. On February 12, 1868, the Columbus, Chicago and Indiana Central Railway was formed as a merger of the Columbus and Indiana Central Railway and Chicago and Great Eastern Railway. The rest of the new main line, from Marion northwest to Anoka, on the old main line east of Logansport, was completed March 15, 1868, making the old route via New Castle and Richmond into a branch. The CC&IC; now had main lines from Columbus, Ohio to Chicago and Indianapolis, Indiana, with branches from near Logansport, Indiana southeast to Richmond, Indiana (on the Indianapolis line) and west to Effner, Indiana. The Erie Railway offered in late 1868 to lease the CC&IC;, but the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway made a better offer on January 22, 1869, leasing it on February 1. =Expansion (1869-90)= 1877 map On December 1, 1869 (retroactive from February 23, 1870) the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway leased the Little Miami Railroad. This included the Columbus and Xenia Railroad, Dayton and Western Railroad and Dayton, Xenia and Belpre Railroad, as well as the Richmond and Miami Railway's branch west to Richmond, Indiana. With that lease, the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired access to Cincinnati. With the 1870 completion of the St. Louis, Vandalia and Terre Haute Railroad and Terre Haute and Indianapolis Rail Road, the PRR now had a route to East St. Louis via the PC&StL; to Indianapolis. The Columbus, Chicago and Indiana Central Railway went bankrupt and was sold at foreclosure on January 10, 1883. The Chicago, St. Louis and Pittsburgh Railroad was incorporated in Indiana on March 14 and Illinois on March 15, and the former CC&IC; was conveyed to the two companies on March 17. Operation by the PC&StL; continued until April 1, 1883. On April 1, 1884, the two companies merged to form one Chicago, St. Louis and Pittsburgh Railroad. That company was merged with the PC&StL;, Cincinnati and Richmond Railroad and Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad on September 30, 1890, to form the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (PCC&StL;). =20th century= In 1891, the PCC&StL; acquired stock ownership of the Little Miami Railroad. On December 21, 1916 (taking effect January 1, 1917), the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway merged with the Vandalia Railroad, Pittsburgh, Wheeling and Kentucky Railroad, Anderson Belt Railway and Chicago, Indiana and Eastern Railway, forming the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad. The PCC&StL; was leased by the PRR on January 1, 1921, and finally was merged into the PRR's Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad on April 2, 1956. In October of 1991, legislation passed by the US Government recognized the Panhandle Line from Pittsburgh to Weirton as a secondary main line. Although the line was very busy at the time, the US Government required Conrail to abandon the line between Pittsburgh and Weirton. The line was abandoned later that month, and Burgettstown to Weirton was lifted in December. Walkers Mill to Burgettstown remained until 2000, and the Panhandle Trail Construction began during 2000. Walkers Mill to Weirton was left in place, and was sold to RailTex in 1994, then the P&OC; in 2000. It was operated by the P&OC; until early 2014. As of March 2018, the line is very overgrown with everything west of Carnegie having been severed from the rest of the P&OC;, and thereby inaccessible. Soon, this line will likely be removed and become part of the trail, sealing the fate of the Panhandle line. =Current use= Sections of the route have been adapted for other uses. The easternmost section, from the Pittsburgh Union Station through the Panhandle Tunnel and over the Panhandle Bridge to Station Square in Pittsburgh, is part of the Pittsburgh Light Rail system. From there to the Sheraden neighborhood of Pittsburgh, the railway forms part of Norfolk Southern's Mon Line. The portion from Sheraden to Carnegie, Pennsylvania has been converted into the West Busway, a bus-only roadway. The section from Carnegie to Walkers Mill, Pennsylvania, retains its rails and is owned by the Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad, however, it has not seen a train since early 2014, and it will likely be removed to become part of the Panhandle Trail. The section from Walkers Mill to Weirton, West Virginia, has been made into the Panhandle Trail, a bicycling/walking trail. From the trail's end in Weirton to Columbus, the rails are still in place: from Weirton to Mingo Junction, the route is part of various rail lines and spurs, and from Mingo Junction to Columbus, the line forms part of the Columbus and Ohio River Railroad.

Bowling leg breaks, he is the only player to have taken two hat- tricks in the same Test match. International cricket career \\"Possibly the best all-round cricketer Williamstown has produced\\",Current Topics: Local Test Cricketers, The Williamstown Chronicle, (Friday, 8 November 1946), p.10. Matthews played in eight Test matches for the Australian cricket team, two in Australia in the 1911/12 season, and six in the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England. He played first-class cricket for Victoria in the seasons from 1906/07 to 1914/15, playing in 67 first-class matches in all, although 28 were played for Australia on the 1912 tour of England. He is famed for being the only player to have ever taken two hat-tricks in the same Test match. In the opening Test of the 1912 Triangular Tournament, playing against South Africa at Old Trafford, he took a hat-trick in each innings. He took the last three wickets in South Africa's first innings, to prevent them avoiding the follow on; later the same day, 28 May 1912, he took a second hat-trick in the second innings. None of the dismissals required the assistance of any fielders: the first batsman was bowled, then two were leg before wicket, then another bowled, and finally two more caught and bowled. South African wicket-keeper Tommy Ward was his third victim in both hat-tricks, being the only known instance of a king pair on debut in Test cricket.Baillie, E. H. M., \\"Late T.J.

In Australia he has been dubbed \\"the father of Australian landscape painting\\". Life in Britain Glover was born at Houghton-on-Hill in Leicestershire, England. His parents were farmer William Glover and Ann (née Bright). He showed a talent for drawing at an early age, and in 1794 was practicing as an artist and drawing-master at Lichfield. The Countess of Harrington helped establish his practice as an art instructor, and may have taken lessons from him herself. He moved to London in 1805, became a member of the Old Water Colour Society, and was elected its president in 1807. In the ensuing years he exhibited a large number of pictures at the exhibitions of this society, and also at the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists. He had one-man shows in London in 1823 and 1824. He was a very successful artist and, although never elected a member of the Academy, his reputation stood very high with the public. Glover achieved fame as a painter of \\"Italianate\\" romantic landscapes of Britain (including The falls of Foyers on Loch Ness, the Lake District and London) and Southern Europe. He became known in both England and France as the English Claude. This phrase was making comparison with Glover and the French seventeenth century artist Claude Lorrain, whose works collected by eighteenth century English \\"grand tourists\\", strongly influenced the evolution of the English style, in both painting and the layout of landscape gardens. On 21 October 1825 Glover was one of three passengers on PS Comet II who alighted at Rothesay, thus escaping the disaster which occurred to the paddle-steamer a few hours later when it was hit by SS Ayr and sank in the River Clyde with the loss of 62 lives. Arrival in Australia Glover decided to move to Australia, arriving in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) on his 64th birthday in 1831. He brought with him a strong reputation as a landscape painter. From April 1831 until early 1832 he lived in Hobart on a property named \\"Stanwell Hall\\", which can be seen in his work Hobart Town, taken from the garden where I lived. In 1832 he acquired one of the largest grants of land in Van Diemen's Land at the time at Mills Plains, Deddington. He named his new property Patterdale after Blowick Farm, a property near Patterdale, at the foot of Ullswater in the Lake District. Glover's grant placed him in close proximity to Kingston, the home of John Batman (later to co-found Melbourne) and his relationship to his neighbour appears to have been fraught. Glover helped build the Chapel at Deddington and is buried within these grounds. Art in Australia A view of the artist's house and garden, in Mills Plains, Van Diemen's Land, 1835, Art Gallery of South Australia Natives on the Ouse River, Van Diemen's Land, 1838, Art Gallery of New South Wales Glover is best known now for his paintings of the Tasmanian landscape. He gave a fresh treatment to the effects of the Australian sunlight on the native bushland by depicting it bright and clear, a definite departure from the darker \\"English country garden\\" paradigm. Note this example Patterdale Farm (circa 1840). His treatment of the local flora was also new because it was a more accurate depiction of the Australian trees and scrubland. Glover noted the \\"remarkable peculiarity of the trees\\" in Australia and observed that \\"however numerous, they rarely prevent your tracing through them the whole distant country\\". Natives on the Ouse River, Van Diemen’s Land (1838) is \\"informed by European notions of an Antipodean Arcadia, with Indigenous people living in a landscape unsullied by European contact.\\" However, it stands in marked contrast to the actual situation of the traditional owners of Ouse River country - the Braylwunyer people of the Big River nation - which was one of dispossession and violence at the hands of the colonists. John Glover's last major work was painted on his 79th birthday. Australian legacy The John Glover Society was established on 22 August 2001 to honour and promote Glover's memory and his contribution to Australian art. The society commissioned a life-size statue of Glover, unveiled in February 2003 in Evandale, Tasmania. It also runs the annual Glover Prize, which is held in Evandale. John Glover's work features in many prominent art galleries throughout Australia (and the world). His work has been the subject of numerous exhibitions and a symposium in Australia. From 2004, The John Glover Society has awarded the Glover Prize for depictions of Tasmanian landscapes. It is the richest art prize in Australia for landscape painting. In 2019, the farmhouse once occuplied by the Glover family, southeast of Launceston, was restored and of surrounding land, which frequently featured in Glover's work, was heritage listed as 'Patterdale and Nile Farm'.

Ramakant Desai was an Indian fast bowler, who stood 5 feet 4 inches tall, earning him the nickname \\"Tiny\\". He made his Test debut against West Indies in 1958–59 took 4/169 in 49 overs. He troubled the batsmen with bouncers, which was unusual for an Indian bowler at the time. He toured England in 1959, West Indies in 1961–62 and Australia and New Zealand in 1967–68. Against Pakistan in 1960–61, he took 21 wickets in the series. At Bombay, he scored a quick 85 batting at No.10, an Indian record, and added a record 149 for the ninth wicket with Nana Joshi. His best bowling performance in Tests was 6 for 56 against New Zealand at Bombay in 1964–65. At Dunedin in 1967–68 his jaw was fractured by a ball from Dick Motz, despite which he added 57 runs for the last wicket with Bishen Bedi.Wisden 1969, p. 854. In his first year in the Ranji Trophy, he took 50 wickets in 7 matches at an average of 11.10.Wisden 1960, p. 886. It is still a record for Bombay. It included a performance of 5 for 10 and 6 for 28 against Saurashtra.Saurashtra v Bombay 1958–59 In the Ranji Trophy final in 1960–61 he took 7 for 46 and 4 for 74 in Bombay's victory over Rajasthan.Rajasthan v Bombay 1960–61 Two years later, also against Rajasthan in the final, he scored his only first-class century, 107, in another victory.Rajasthan v Bombay 1962–63 In his 11 years in the Bombay team (1958–59 to 1968–69), he never finished in a losing side. Desai announced his retirement at the prize distribution ceremony of the 1968-69 Ranji Trophy final.Indian Express, February 20, 1969 As the only bowler of pace in the Indian team, he was perennially overworked. When Desai retired from regular first-class cricket after the 1968–69 season, when still only 29 years old, P.N. Sundaresan wrote that he \\"bowled his heart out on the dead pitches in India ... A more judicious use of his talent both in the Ranji Trophy and other matches could have preserved him as a penetrating bowler for a longer period.\\"Wisden 1970, p. 960. Desai was the chairman of selectors from 1996–97. He resigned the post a month before his death. He died four days after being admitted in a hospital for a cardiac arrest.

The MGM film was written by John C. Higgins and George Zuckerman. The film was shot by cinematographer John Alton, who used shadows and lighting effects to involve an audience despite the fact that the film was shot on a low budget. The drama features Ricardo Montalbán, George Murphy, Howard Da Silva, among others.. Premise The story concerns two agents, one Mexican (PJF) and one American, who are tasked to stop the smuggling of Mexican migrant workers across the border to California.

These are 'wide' but not 'open' spaces, as Alton's beautifully registered grey-toned but grim visuals make the distant horizons as closed as the American border.

The locality is about east of the town of Longford. The 2016 census has a population of 121 for the state suburb of Deddington. The town is situated on the Nile River and lies in the foothills of Ben Lomond.  History  The first inhabitants of the Deddington area were Tasmanian Aboriginal people of the Ben Lomond Nation. Aboriginal artifacts indicating land use (hunting) and seasonal camps have been found along the Nile River and Patterdale Creek. It is uncertain which clans had specific use of the area but the Plindermairhemener clan is referred to as occupying the western South Esk region. The palawa kani (Tasmanian Aboriginal Language) name for the Nile River at Deddington was witakina. It is likely that the Deddington area was a hunting ground as well as part of the seasonal migratory route for both the Ben Lomond Nation clans, referred to generally as the Plangermaireener, and also clans from the North Midlands Nation; who visited the Ben Lomond plateau in summer. Settlers were granted land around the site of the current town in the second and third decades of the 1800s. James Cox was granted land at Nile, Anthony Cottrell to the North at Gordons Plains, and Massey was granted land to the south at Mills Plains, now the Deddington district. It is likely that stockeepers, kangaroo hunters and timber-cutters ( convicts assigned to colonial landowners) moved in advance of settlers to the fringes of the Ben Lomond escarpment and up the South Esk Valley. As was common at the frontier, stockkeepers both negotiated and came into conflict with the Aboriginal clans in the Deddington area. Aboriginal people often traded at the frontier with assigned men, the currency being food, sexual favours and hunting dogs. But, relations would often sour: sometimes with fatal consequences and the first recorded killing of convict stockmen at Deddington occurred in 1825, when Arnold and Booth (assigned men working for Barclay and Cox) were killed and mutilated at their stockhut in a dispute over ownership of hunting dogs and abuse of women. Unusually, a Plangermaireener witness, Temina, gave evidence under translation at trial in Launceston and he stated that the two men were speared to death and further mutilated by women of his people who 'crushed his head with a stone' In subsequent years, there are several records of disputes at the frontier - with killing of cattle and retributive violence on both sides. Finally, escalating pressures on the Plangermaireener from encroaching settlement on hunting grounds, increasing violence, permitted by lax colonial policies towards Indigenous rights to land, and removal of women and children for sexual or domestic enslavement led to the desperate violence of the Black War. During the Black War, the remaining Aboriginal Clansmen of the Plangermaireener prosecuted a desperate campaign of harassment and theft along the South Esk and Nile valleys. John Batman and Anthony Cottrell were both involved in Roving Parties, essentially bounty hunters contracted to remove Aboriginal people from contested areas by force. It was reported in August 1829 that violence had escalated around the Deddington area, culminating in the fatal spearing of an assigned of the settler, Lord. At his time Batman received his commission to establish his Roving Party, consisting of several NSW Aboriginal people procured for this purpose and supported by a convict party and the Tasmanian Aboriginal 'Black Bill' Ponsonby. John Batman made numerous forays from his home at Kingston, near Deddington, following the Plangermaireener up the South Esk Valley to the South and East of Ben Lomond. John Batman describes in his letters of July 1830 how he had dispatched women of the Ben Lomond Nation along tracks around their 'usual haunts' around Stacks Bluff and to Pigeons Plains -the Nile Valley near Lilyburn Bridge, north of Deddington. By the 1840s the remnant peoples of the Ben Lomond nation had long been exiled to Flinders Island and there was sufficient settler population in the Deddington area for a chapel to be constructed above the Nile River. Local legend has it that the artist John Glover built the chapel but it is likely that the chapel was erected by the land donor and Rev. Russell from Evandale. John Glover is buried in the cemetery. Services for the emerging town and rural area were instituted from the 1860s when the town area was circumscribed. Deddington Post Office opened on 1 December 1862 and closed in 1970. A school opened in Deddington in early 1865, at the chapel, at the urging of Rev. Russell and the first teacher employed at 50 pounds a year. By mid 1866 land had been set aside for police barracks and a constable was permanently stationed in the town. Perhaps coincidentally the Deddington Inn was licensed in December of the same year. In 1882 a correspondent to the launceston Examiner newspaper stated: \\"Deddington contains one hotel and store combined, a brick building, a smithy, post-oflice, and about a dozen other buildings.\\" By 1980 the town centre had declined with the post office, school and shop long closed. The Deddington Inn burnt down in 1980 and now the town, and rural area, is serviced by the nearby town of Evandale. Deddington was gazetted as a locality in 1959. Geography The Nile River, a tributary of the South Esk River, flows through from east to west. Road infrastructure Route C420 (Deddington Road) passes through from north to west.

Retrieved 24 March 2018 It was voted number 973 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). Tour The Fall embarked on a month-long tour to support the album release, playing to ever-growing audiences throughout UK and Ireland. Things took a turn for the worse when in Cardiff the band's van was broken into and almost all the gear was stolen, including Brix's rare Gretsch guitar (which would be recovered years later). After a lacklustre next day's show played on replacement gear hastily provided by Beggars Banquet, an argument exploded as furious Mark E. Smith blamed the band for allowing the theft to happen. As a result, Steve and Paul Hanley immediately left the band, fed up with Smith's treatment. This left The Fall with a single drummer and no bassist. Both Hanleys were persuaded to return for a televised performance on The Old Grey Whistle Test, where The Fall played \\"Lay of the Land\\" accompanied by the Michael Clark Dance Company. Eventually, Brix talked Smith into making peace with Steve Hanley, whom she considered as the anchor and the most reliable person in the band; Hanley's departure was then changed to a temporary leave, as he was under the additional stress of having to look after his ill premature-born son. In the meantime, the bass player's position was taken by Simon Rogers, a classically-trained musician whom Smith met through mutual acquaintance Michael Clark. A capable multi-instrumentalist, Rogers remained in The Fall as a keyboardist/guitarist when Steve Hanley finally rejoined in May 1985.

The original exception is saved as a property (such as cause) of the new exception. The idea is that a method should throw exceptions defined at the same abstraction level as the method itself, but without discarding information from the lower levels. For example, a method to play a movie file might handle exceptions in reading the file by re-throwing them inside an exception of movie playing. The user interface doesn't need to know whether the error occurred during reading chunk of bytes or calling eof(). It needs only the exception message extracted from cause. The user interface layer will have its own set of exceptions. The one interested in cause can see its stack trace during debugging or in proper log. Throwing the right kind of exceptions is particularly enforced by checked exceptions in the Java programming language, and starting with language version 1.4 almost all exceptions support chaining. In runtime engine environments such as Java or .NET there exist tools that attach to the runtime engine and every time that an exception of interest occurs they record debugging information that existed in memory at the time the exception was thrown (stack and heap values). These tools are called Exception Interception and they provide \\"root-cause\\" information for exceptions in Java programs that run in production, testing, or development environments.

Like Gion, Ponto-chō is famous for the preservation of forms of traditional architecture and entertainment. Etymology The name Ponto-chō is said to be a portmanteau of the Portuguese word \\"ponte\\" (bridge) and the Japanese word \\"-chō\\" meaning town, block or street. District Ponto-chō centres around one long, narrow, cobbled alley running from Shijō-dōri to Sanjō-dōri, one block west of the Kamo River (Kamo- gawa). This is also the traditional location of the start of kabuki, and a statue of Okuni still stands on the opposite side of the river. The district crest is a stylized water plover or chidori. Cultural features Geiko and maiko have existed in Ponto-chō since at least the 16th century, as have prostitution and other forms of entertainment. Today the area, lit by traditional lanterns at night, contains a mix of very expensive restaurants — often featuring outdoor riverside dining on wooden patios — geisha houses and tea houses, brothels, bars, and cheap eateries. The area is also home to the Ponto-chō Kaburenjō Theatre at the Sanjō-dōri end of the street. This theatre functions as a practice hall for geiko and maiko and twice a year since the 1870s Kyoto geiko and maiko perform the Kamogawa Odori — Kamogawa river dancing, a combination of traditional dance, kabuki-like theatre, singing and the playing of traditional instruments — there, offering a rare chance for ordinary people to see performances by real geiko and maiko. An American Liza Dalby became a geiko in Ponto-chō during college studies and later wrote a popular book favorable to the community there.

He then served as President of Our Lady of Holy Cross College in New Orleans. After his retirement from academia in the 1980s, he worked in local government, including serving as the director of emergency management for Jefferson Parish, Louisiana--which contains several suburbs of New Orleans--since 1998. Maestri became known as \\"Dr. Doom\\" for his dire predictions of hurricane damage. In 2000, five years before Hurricane Katrina hit the region, Maestri stated that unless greater hurricane preparedness steps were taken, flooding and toxic waste from a major hurricane could make large parts of the city uninhabitable for several years following. During the Katrina disaster, a plan created by Maestri led to the evacuation of many pump station operators, exacerbating flooding. Maestri's role in the evacuation sidelined his appointment to a state-level emergency planning job, and he became a private consultant. Death Maestri died on June 12, 2017.

Little Archie #1 is considered to be \\"scarce\\" by the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide (only 20-100 copies exist). Beginnings According to the introduction in The Best of Archie,\\"The Best of Archie\\", introduction by Michael Uslan and Jeffrey Mendel, page 13, Archie Comics Publications, 1980. the idea for Little Archie came about during a poker game. John Goldwater was playing cards with some of the other comic book publishers one night and they began to kid him about his Archie comics. They told him: \\"Here we publish all types of comic books and you make an empire just out of Archie. All your books are Archie this or Archie that or Big Archie or Little Archie...\\" Inspired, Goldwater added Little Archie in 1956. Bob Bolling wrote and drew the comic strip, which introduced new plots and characters to the Archie legend by concentrating on the adventures of the gang during their early elementary-school days. Dexter Taylor succeeded him on the series. Overview Little Archie featured Archie and his friends as elementary school-aged children. It is arguably the most successful of the alternate versions of Archie. The world of Little Archie is remarkably similar to that of his teenage counterpart. Most of the same characters are featured, albeit usually in younger versions. Miss Grundy and Mr. Weatherbee appear as a teacher and the principal at Riverdale Elementary School. Little Archie is always referred to and addressed as \\"Little Archie\\". Although stories featuring one of the other characters would be titled \\"Little Jughead\\", \\"Little Betty\\" and so on, the characters themselves were always addressed by their regular names. Keeping in mind its younger target audience, Little Archie stories tended to have more educational and moral content than standard Archie stories. In addition to the main comic, The Adventures of Little Archie, there were also spin-offs Little Archie in Animal Land (1957-1958) and Little Archie Mystery (1963), which put the characters in a more realistically drawn setting. In the early 1990s, there was a radical redesign of the Little Archie universe. Renamed as \\"The New Little Archie\\", it featured the Little Archie characters with contemporary fashions, hairstyles, and sensibilities, and with a more modern-looking art style. One notable change was that Archie was now addressed merely as \\"Archie\\" and no longer \\"Little Archie\\". This relaunch was by and large unsuccessful, and the Little Archie universe soon went back to its old style. Characters Many recurring characters appeared only in Little Archie, though several were later introduced in the mainstream comics. * Abercrombie and Stitch: Two aliens who have visited Little Archie on some adventures. * Caramel: Betty's golden-haired cat. She originally appeared in Little Archie, but would later become a frequent character in the main continuity. She continues to make occasional appearances. Betty has owned many cats (Max, Susie, Buddy, Samantha, etc.), but Caramel is the best known and the most frequently appearing. * Polly and Chic Cooper: Betty's older sister and brother introduced in Little Archie in the 1960s as teenagers. Polly mainly appeared in stories about her \\"older sister\\" relationship with Little Betty, while Chic mostly appeared in the adventure-based stories as Little Archie's teenage friend who could fill the role of \\"adult\\" when the plot needed a character who could drive a car, fight with the villains, etc. For years, they were not canonical characters in the mainstream Archie comics. However, by the 1990s, they had been integrated into the main continuity. Both have strawberry-blonde hair, are currently in their twenties and are close to each other in age, but are significantly older than Betty (Polly still affectionately calls her \\"baby sister\\" on occasion). To explain why they rarely appear in the comics, it was established that Polly works as a television news reporter in San Francisco, and Chic works as a secret agent for the United States government. Both occasionally visited their family, though Polly made more appearances. Around 2005, it was revealed that Polly had accepted a job in Riverdale, and she now appears often, mainly in the Betty comic book. * Mad Doctor Doom & Chester: Not to be confused with Marvel Comics' Doctor Doom, Mad Doctor Doom is a green-skinned mad scientist who has terrorized Archie and the gang since they were children, as they constantly foiled his plans of gaining great wealth and conquering the world. Doom was assisted by Chester, his nitwitted, teenaged slacker of an assistant (occasionally said to be his nephew). Chester looks and acts like a stereotypical 1950s juvenile delinquent. They both made at least one appearance in the mainstream comics. * Evelyn Evernever: A young girl who was acquainted with Archie and friends when they were young. Evelyn was a shy girl with a bit of an inferiority complex, with tenuous relations to the rest of the gang. Her only real friend was her doll, Minerva. Evelyn Evernever likes to think of herself as a \\"bou'tiful\\" gal. After a long hiatus Evelyn Evernever reappears as a teenage girl who kidnapped Archie in a recent all-out action issue of Betty & Veronica Spectacular. It was shown in a recent issue of Veronica that Evelyn was Archie's first kiss. * Fangs Fogarty: A fat, snaggle- toothed bully who tormented Archie, Jughead and Reggie in their younger years. Fangs was an unreasonable thug who brutally battered his classmates, either because they looked at his self-appointed girlfriend Penny, they insulted him behind his back, or for no reason at all. He was, however, good friends with Dilton. When, in one story, Archie and Reggie (not yet knowing this) learned that Dilton is a karate expert—surpassed, he says, only by his friend Edward—they persuaded him to confront Fangs, presuming Dilton could beat him up. In preparation for the encounter, Archie and Reggie deliberately provoked Fangs into a fit of rage. However, when Dilton arrived, he cheerfully greeted Fangs as \\"Edward.\\" Presumably, Fangs moved away at around the time Moose Mason arrived in Riverdale. Fangs eventually showed up in the mainstream comics in a story titled \\"Blast from the Past\\", first printed in Archie's Double Digest #117 (August 2000). Now a tall, muscular, handsome young man nicknamed Smiley after getting his orthodontic work, he had returned to Riverdale to apologize to those he had formerly antagonized. In this story Fangs' first name is given as Fred instead of Edward. * Bubbles McBounce: Bubbles McBounce was an obese girl from Little Archie. Being heavier than the other kids, she is known for such moments as the time she saved the day by holding down an air balloon that risked taking Archie and the gang on a magical voyage. * Penny Peabody: Fangs Fogarty's girlfriend. Their relationship is exactly like Moose and Midge's: Fangs will hurt any boy who even talks to Penny. * The Perilous Pike: A pike that lives in Logger's Pond, a large pond near Riverdale. No one has ever caught the Perilous Pike, though some people have almost caught him. In some stories, attempts to fish for him cause the Pike to attack a member of Archie's gang. * Ambrose Pipps: A small, shy boy with a large nose and an outsized baseball cap pulled over his face. Like Fangs Fogarty, most of his appearances have been in the Little Archie series. Ambrose was the tagalong of Archie's gang when they were young. Although Ambrose's loyalty was unflagging, Little Archie took pride in bullying and exploiting him, without ever letting him join the \\"good ol' gang.\\" Although a teenage Archie was apprehensive when Ambrose returned to Riverdale after several years' absence, Ambrose held no grudges, and the two became good friends. In the story \\"The Great Quiz Whiz Contest\\" reprinted in Archie's Pals 'n' Gals #108, Archie pulls out his lucky double sided penny from his pocket that his pal Ambrose gave him. Both Ambrose and Fangs have very brief cameos in Tales From Riverdale #24. Ambrose was re- introduced more recently as an adult in Life with Archie: The Married Life, depicted as running a small diner in New York City long after he left Riverdale. * The Southside Serpents: A gang of kids who were the rivals of Little Archie's gang and lived in the southern district of Riverdale. They filled the role of Central High Students when a rival group was needed. * Spotty: Little Archie's brown dog with black spots. He appeared primarily in Little Archie, as an honorary member of the gang, so he has been known to tag along with them on their adventures. He has a close relationship with his master, and Little Archie often worries about him being in danger. Spotty has made a few appearances in the main continuity, usually shown as an older, less active dog. His most recent appearance in mainstream continuity was Archie's Double Digest #196 in 2009. * Sue Stringly: Sue was a poor little girl who knew Archie and the gang when they were young. Sue's family didn't have much money, and they lived in a shack near the railway tracks. Despite this, Sue was an upbeat, cheerful girl who never complained or despaired over her predicament. While most of the school students didn't want anything to do with her, eventually Sue became good friends with Little Archie and Veronica. Her father was sometimes said to be working in a pickle plant. Sue also lived next to a coal mine. In one story, she was called a cousin of Veronica Lodge. Although her hair is blonde, she bears a resemblance to Big Ethel. After a long hiatus right after Evelyn Evernevers return, Sue Stringly reappears as a teenage secret agent who rescues Archie and befriends Betty & Veronica (Agent B & Agent V) in a recent issue of Betty & Veronica Digest.

It also covers Northwestern North Carolina. The paper is owned by Lee Enterprises. The Journal was founded in 1897. Overview The Journal is primarily distributed through Forsyth County and the county seat of Winston-Salem. However, the paper also is distributed in Alleghany County, Ashe County, Davidson County, Davie County, Stokes County, Surry County, Wilkes County, Watauga County, and Yadkin County. The newspaper has an online presence called JournalNow. The Journal's television partner is WGHP of High Point, North Carolina. The newspaper produces several weekly sections, including Business, Food, Journal West, and Relish. It also publishes a monthly city magazine called Winston- Salem Monthly, which started in 2006 and several special editions, including Carolina Weddings, City Guide, and WS Works. The Winston-Salem Journal has won several N.C. Press Association awards. In 2018, the paper won a Media and the Law Award of Excellence for Best Daily Article (Scott Sexton); the Henry Lee Weathers Freedom of Information Award; and a General Excellence award for their website. In 2017, the paper won the Hugh Morton Photographer of the Year award (Allison Lee Isley), Beat News Reporting, Best Community Coverage, and more. History The Winston-Salem Journal, started by Charles Landon Knight, began publishing in the afternoons on April 3, 1897. The area's other newspaper, the Twin City Sentinel, also was an afternoon paper. Knight moved out of the area and the Journal had several owners before publisher D.A. Fawcett made it a morning paper starting January 2, 1902. Later that summer, the Journal began publishing on Sundays, after which Fawcett's church removed him from its membership. In 1903, A.F.W. Leslie and his son, A.V. Leslie, bought the paper. The elder Leslie, an artist and the son of an engraver, made the Journal the state's first newspaper to have photographs. Owen Moon bought the Journal in 1925, and the Sentinel, owned by Frank A. Gannett of the New York newspaper chain, in 1927. The Sentinel began as the Twin City Daily on May 4, 1885, serving both Winston and Salem. The Weekly Gleaner, founded by John Christian Blum on January 6, 1829, served the small community of Salem and was later taken over by the weekly Western Sentinel, the first newspaper in Winston on May 16, 1856. The Twin City Daily, in turn, took over the Sentinel. :Preceding newspapers include: The Daily Journal (1900-190?) and Twin City Sentinel (1916-1974) The Journal And Sentinel moved into a new building on North Marshall Street in 1927, and the Sunday edition was called The Journal and Sentinel. Editor Santford Martin advocated improvements in the roads, especially in \\"the forgotten provinces\\" of Northwest North Carolina. WSJS, an AM radio station, and later WSJS-FM and WSJS-TV, took their call letters from \\"Winston-Salem Journal Sentinel\\" because the newspapers once owned all three stations. Attorney Gordon Gray bought the newspapers on April 30, 1937. His commitment to serving communities throughout the newspapers' coverage area continued even after Media General Inc. purchased the newspapers in 1969. The \\"Call SAM (Sentinel Answer Man)\\" column appeared in the Sentinel starting October 10, 1966. Bill Williams wrote the column, assisted by Christine Friedenberg, who took over in 1984. David Watson answered questions as the \\"Straight Answer Man\\" in the Journal from 1985 until his death in 2000. Ronda Bumgardner was the \\"Straight Answer Ma'am\\" from 2000 to 2009, and Tim Clodfelter became SAM in 2010. Melissa Hall became the second \\"Straight Answer Ma'am\\" in 2020. On March 29, 1985, the Sentinel published its last edition. This meant a stronger morning newspaper, and an increase in circulation from 73,000 to over 91,000, with Sunday circulation of 106,000. In September 1994, the Journal moved some of its operations into a new building on East 5th Street, with a Mitsubishi press that allowed improvements in color printing. Other publications from the Journal serve older adults, people with pets, families with children in Forsyth County schools, prospective brides and young parents. In 2004, the paper refused to endorse a presidential candidate. The paper endorsed Democratic President Barack Obama for 2012 presidential election even though it endorsed Obama's opponent Republican Senator John McCain in 2008. Its editorial-page had not endorsed a Democratic Party presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The paper endorsed Libertarian Gary Johnson for the 2016 presidential election and was the second newspaper to endorse the Libertarian candidate in this election cycle instead of either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, the paper cited their distrust of both major candidates and of status quo politics in the American political system. =Cutbacks and sale= In August 2007, the Journal reported it was changing its daily business section and cutting five positions. Two of the positions eliminated were in the newsroom. Many changes occurred in 2010. In April, the Journal's parent company, Media General, announced that it was dropping all Winston-Salem-based copy editor and design positions, shifting production to consolidated editing centers in Richmond, Va., and Tampa, Fla. Media General also announced that they are going to use a portion of their $1 million of cost savings to \\"focus on intensified local news coverage.\\" In October, Carl Crothers, the paper's executive editor was let go as a cost- cutting measure.

This photo was taken before all of the CUE's Gillig Phantom buses were retired in the fall of 2015. CUE Bus (City-University-Energysaver) is a bus service operated by the City of Fairfax, Virginia, and is completely separate from the Fairfax Connector bus service run by Fairfax County. Routes and services CUE operates two loop routes between George Mason University and the Vienna Metro station, each running in both directions for a total of four named routes. The Green loop, consisting of routes Green 1 (clockwise) and Green 2 (counterclockwise) operates on the east side of Fairfax, while the Gold loop, consisting of routes Gold 1 (clockwise) and Gold 2 (counterclockwise) operates on the west side. In addition to providing service to GMU and Vienna Metro, the CUE serves all major activity centers in the City of Fairfax, including downtown, Kamp Washington, Old Town Fairfax, Fairfax Circle and Fair City Mall. In 2009, the City of Fairfax partnered with Montgomery County, Maryland, in the purchase of new buses. As a result, six 35-foot, low-floor Gillig Hybrid buses were added to the fleet in August 2009. These new buses are expected to consume much less fuel, as they operate off an electric engine when operated at 35 MPH or lower, and 35 MPH is the maximum speed limit in Fairfax. The CUE Bus system owns and operates eight additional 35-foot, low- floor Gillig clean diesel buses in its fleet, all of which replaced the remaining 30-foot Gillig Phantom buses in the fall of 2015. Fares CUE's current base fare is $1.75 for riders using cash and for riders using SmarTrip. For primary and secondary school students, seniors and people with disabilities with a valid CUE Bus ID, fares are 85¢. George Mason University students ride free, as a portion of their student fees funds CUE's operation. CUE, along with all other regional bus systems in the Washington area, does not issue or accept paper transfers. Riders must use a SmarTrip card to get the rail-to-bus discount or to transfer free from bus to bus.

Between 1939 and 1960, Tushino was classed as a separate town. The Skhodnya River flows across the southern part of Tushino. Sergey Ivanov. History The village was attested since the late 14th century as an estate of boyar Vasili Ivanovich Kvashnin-Tusha and later his sons Pyotr and Semyon. In the middle of the 16th century, the village and the nearby Saviour Monastery were acquired by the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. One of the finest of Russian tent-like churches was built in the monastery under Ivan the Terrible. In the late 16th century, the monastery used to provide lodging for foreign diplomatic missions before their arrival in Moscow. During the Time of Troubles, False Dmitry II and his supporters settled in Tushino between 1608 and 1610. The Tushino camp was a replica of the Muscovite court, having its own prikazes and the Patriarch. From here, False Dmitry II was laying siege to the Moscow Kremlin. In December 1609, the Tushino Thief (as the impostor came to be known) and his wife Marina Mniszech fled from Tushino to Kaluga after losing Polish support. In 1610, the combined Russo-Swedish army of Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky and Jacob de La Gardie forced False Dmitry's supporters out of Tushino. Thereafter the monastery was disbanded, and the village declined. In the second half of the 19th century, Tushino saw the first industrial enterprises, such as windmills and a textile mill. In the 1920s, they built Tushino Stocking Factory. In 1929, the Soviets established a flying school of the Osoaviakhim (Осоавиахим, which is short for the Society for Support of the Defense, Aviation, and Chemical Industries) and then Tushino Airfield with research facilities and aircraft factories next to Tushino. The Tushino workers took an active part in the revolutionary movement: guards were created in 1905, and during the December fighting in Moscow (12 December), the terrorists made an unsuccessful attempt to discourage station Tushino train with weapons. After the suppression of the uprising in Moscow, a Cossack punitive expedition was sent to Tushino. In October 1917, local workers supported the Bolsheviks and the slogan \\"All Power to the Soviets\\": thus, the majority of workers was for this new government. At the Tushino-Guchkov Council Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, a revolutionary committee was created, which with the help of the Red Guards seized control of the vicinity of the station; a significant number of local Red Guards took part in the October fighting in Moscow. 104 people were sent to Moscow from \\"Explorer\\" (factory). 17 Red factory Hutareva (ex. Suvirovoy) in Bratsevo returned after the fighting and found the factory gates closed. They arrested the owner, who fled. The result, however, was that in the early 20s until collectivization, factories did not work, except for Brattsevskoy. A flight school was founded near Tushino in 1929, followed by a glider factory in 1930.

His works include sets of bronze doors for the headquarters of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Norwich City Hall; the Queen's Beasts, originally made for the Coronation in 1953, and later replicated in stone, and the statue of Robin Hood outside Nottingham Castle. Life Woodford was born in Nottingham on 25 September 1893. His father was a lace designer. Woodford started studying at the Nottingham School of Art, but his studies were curtailed when he enlisted during the First World War. After the war, he continued his training at the Royal College of Art in London, and was Rome Scholar in 1922–25. Woodford designed the bronze doors of the 1930s extension of the Liverpool Blind School in Hope Street. The doors were later transferred to the new Blind School when it moved to Wavertree, a suburb of Liverpool.Detail from the doors at 66 Portland Place.Nottingham. Statue of Robin Hood, 1951. In 1934 Woodford created a monumental pair of doors for the headquarters of the Royal Institute of British Architects at 66 Portland Place, London. They each weigh one-and-a- half tons, the deep relief designs showing the River Thames and various London buildings. He also made figures on the exterior columns, interior ceiling plaster reliefs depicting the main periods of English architecture and various building trades and crafts, and stone window-pieces depicting building through the ages. Four years later he made a set of 18 sculptured roundels for the six bronze doors of Norwich City Hall, depicting the history of the city and manual trades practised there. He created the sculpture of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops, that sits above the portal of The Corn Exchange, Brighton, which was installed in 1934. Woodford did some decorative work for the liner RMS Queen Mary, carving wooden screens and designing bronze uplighters for the cabin class smoking room. Another commission around this time was for the facade of the fashionably decorated Good Intent restaurant in Chelsea, where he carved large wooden reliefs of a mermaid and two seahorses. During World War II, Woodford served as a camouflage officer with the Air Ministry. After the war he created a small number of war memorials, most notably for the Court of Honour of the British Medical Association building in Tavistock Square. For the coronation ceremony of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, Woodford made a set of ten plaster sculptures of the Queen's Beasts, each tall to be placed at the entrance of Westminster Abbey. He went on to make a set of Portland stone replicas which an anonymous donor presented to Kew Gardens in 1956. They now stand on the Palm House Terrace. In the 1950s Woodford made a set of reliefs representing the four elements for the Lloyds building in Lime Street in the City of London. They were placed very high up; Arthur Byron in London's Statues (1981) describes them as \\"barely visible.\\" Following the demolition of the building they were installed on a wall at street level as part of the landscaping of the Willis Building on the same site. In 1951 he made the group of bronze statues of Robin Hood and his Merry Men that stand near the gates of Nottingham Castle. The group is now Grade II listed as part of the historic setting of the castle. In 1962 he modelled a new version of the royal coat of arms for use on major public buildings such as courts and embassies for the Ministry of Public Buildings; the Times said it was \\"more shapely than the old design, and displays the Lion and Unicorn with greater vigour\\". He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy on 2 March 1937 and a full Academician on 27 April 1945, and appointed OBE in the 1953 Coronation Honours. He moved in the early 1970s from Chiswick, west London to Twickenham, where he died on 8 November 1976.

It surrounds the capital city of Vilnius on 3 sides, while the rest borders the Trakai District Municipality. At the 2011 Census, Poles amounted to 52.07% out of 95,348 inhabitants. 32.47% were Lithuanians, 8.01% Russians, 4.17% Belarusians, 0.65% Ukrainians and 0.11% Jews.  History  Tumuli of Karmazinai Vilnius district municipality is situated in the territory what was once Baltic East Lithuanian Barrow Culture (c. 3/4th–11/12th century AD) and numerous archaeological sites from this period are situated within its borders. During the formation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, major part of what is now Vilnius district municipality was the nucleus of Lietuva Duchy (the land – Lietuva), while the territory to the North of Maišiagala belonged to Neris land. There are some evidences, that Bukiškis just North of Vilnius, which historic name was Gedvydžiai could be associated with Duke Gedvydas and through this link – with Mindaugas„Būtovės slėpiniai: Kernavė ar Vilnius?“. According to Jan Długosz, the pagan ruler of Lithuania Algirdas was cremated in Kukaveitis sacred forest near Maišiagala, after his death in Maišiagala castle in 1377. Nemenčinė (1338), Maišiagala (1254, 1365), Medininkai (1387) known from written sources from the 13th-14th centuries, were among the oldest settlements in Lithuania. These were trade and defense centers with castles as well as religious centers – after the Christianization of Lithuania, early churches were built here. As Vilnius was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the territory around the city was forming the very center of the state, so called Lithuania proper. It was the major part of a much larger Vilnius Duchy and later – Vilnius Voivodeship. After the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Vilna Governorate was formed and Vilensky Uyezd occupied all of what is now Vilnius district municipality. When Vilnius and its suburbs in 1923 were incorporated into Interwar Poland, what is now Vilnius district municipality was the core of Powiat wileńsko-trocki. After the World War II, Vilnius district municipality was formed. Initially small Vilnius district (938 km²) was soon significantly enlarged, absorbing Naujoji Vilnia district (in 1959) and Nemenčinė district (in 1962), parts of Ukmergė district, but transferring some smaller administrative territories to Molėtai district and Švenčionys district, including Pabradė (in 1962). After 1962 (then 2313 km²), there were only minor administrative reforms, attaching some territories from Vilnius district municipality (now 2129 km²) to Vilnius city. In March 1987 Pašilaičiai, Fabijoniškės, Kelmija, Raisteliai villages and parts of Pavilionys, Baltoji Vokė, Prašiškės, Bajorai, Buivydiškės, Grigaičiai, Vanaginė villages were attached to Vilnius cityVisuotinio 1989 m. gyventojų surašymo duomenys, Vilnius, 1993.

Dealing Cards are dealt one at a time to each player, clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's left. Each player receives six cards. Bidding Bidding is the key to the game, as it is essentially what makes it different from Euchre. Starting at the person to the left of the dealer, each player \\"bids\\" how many \\"tricks\\" he or she thinks it is possible to get in partnership with his/her partner (sitting across the table). Players may pass or bid, and a \\"one\\" bid is generally not used. Common bids are 3, 4, and 5. There are some variations, but in most traditional pepper games the bidding only goes around the table once. That is, each player only bids once. At the end of bidding, he or she who bid the highest wins the bid and gets to name the suit which will become trump. Bidding does not generally exceed 5 (6 is maximum), as there are two special bids. *A small pepper, also called \\"shooting\\" or \\"give me your best\\", or \\"one best\\", is where the bidder gets to exchange one card with his/her partner (but does not get to choose or say which card he/she wants...he/she may only say the suit that is trump) and then plays alone against the other two players. The partner also has the option to return the original card back to the bidder if he/she chooses to do so. He/she must get all six tricks. If all six tricks are won, the team with the winning small pepper receives 7 points. *A big pepper, also called \\"loner\\" or \\"moon\\", is the same as a small pepper, except the bidder does not get any cards from his/her partner, and, if successful, receives 14 points. Players may also call \\"super moon\\", which is when he attempts to get all six bids without looking at his hand first and does not receive any help from his partner. If someone calls One best, moon, or super moon, the dealer is allowed to call the same or higher bid and win the bid. Note: In another variation of this game, known as \\"hawsy\\" (also short for Hasenpfeffer), the little pepper is known as \\"hawsy\\" and there is no big pepper. If one player bids hawsy, the next player can bid \\"double hawsy\\" for an attempt at 24 points. Note: Another variation includes these 'pepper' bids, but calls them 12s and 24s as those are the points awarded. If a player calls 24, their partner can call 48. A call of 48 would mean that the calling player names the trump suit and their partner must take all 6 tricks alone with no pass card. This is rare but not impossible. The highest call would be a 96, and the calling player must decided on trump suit before seeing their cards, and then take all 6 tricks. Again, not impossible, but highly improbable. =\\"two\\" bid= To delineate a \\"two\\" bid, the terminology \\"a couple\\" is used; this is because of the special meaning given to the word \\"two.\\" If a player holds two jacks of the same color (both \\"black\\" jacks or both \\"red\\" jacks), he/she can bid \\"two\\" to indicate to his/her partner this special possession. This gives the partner useful information when placing his/her bid. The only catch is when one wants to bid \\"two\\" but someone has already bid \\"a couple\\" or \\"three\\" or \\"four.\\" It has often been the case for the player with the \\"two\\" bid to promptly say (after the higher bid was made), \\"Well, that shoots a two bid!\\" This technique was for a time successful at still communicating the \\"two\\" information to the partner; however, it is generally considered grounds for a misdeal and is therefore not allowed. Leading and taking tricks At the end of bidding, the winning bidder then makes the opening lead and may lead any card. The other players each play a card (playing clockwise) and must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, he/she may play any card. There is no rule about who may play trump first. The trick goes to the highest trump or, if there are no trump cards, to the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick. For example, if spades are trump, the jack of spades is the highest trump, followed by the jack of clubs (the other jack of the same color) which is considered a spade for this hand, the ace of spades, K, Q, 10, 9. The ranking follows the same pattern for the other suits when they are trump. Scoring The contracting side scores one point for each trick taken if it makes at least its contract, but is set back (loses) six points if it fails to make its contract, regardless of the value of the contract or the tricks actually won. A side is \\"set\\" when it fails to meet its contract (the term \\"set\\" also functions as a verb in this game: a side playing defense \\"sets\\" the other side by preventing it from meeting its contract). As such, a side can have a negative score. If the side playing defense (that is, the side that does not win the bid) fails to get any tricks, it goes back six points. An exception to this is in cases of a 'pepper' bid. With this contract, if all the tricks are taken, the contracting side wins 14 or 12 points (for the big and small pepper, respectively). However, if the contracting side fails to take all six tricks, it is set back 14 or 12 points (for big and small, respectively). The opposing side always scores one point for each trick taken. If the defensive side does not get any tricks in a small or big pepper, it loses just six points. Winning Although the \\"magic number\\" may vary from tradition to tradition, the standard winning number is 42 (32 in \\"hawsy\\"). The first team to reach 42 (or more) points wins. However, to win, a team must reach (or exceed) 42 on offense, meaning that a team with a point total near 42 must win the bid, meet its contract, and exceed 42 points to be considered the winner. This also means that a team with 41 points cannot play defense and, by winning one trick, get 42 and win (in a hand where the contracting side meets its contract). The exception to this rule is when the defensive side \\"sets\\" the offense (or contracting side) and, in doing so, meets or exceeds 42 points. It is thus possible that a team will have more than 42 points before the game is over, for only when a team meets its contract and, in doing so, reaches (or exceeds) 42 is it crowned the winner. Other variations of the game do not use a winning number and instead allow players to set a time limit such as one or two hours, at the end of which time the team with the highest point total wins. Another variation of double deck euchre is a 48 card deck, 12 to each player. Two teams of 2 players each. Bids are made as Trump, no trump and low (where the cards rank as 9, 10, J, Q, K, A). Minimum bid is 3, the winning bid is the highest bid. If you make your bid, you get one point for each trick your team takes. If the team with highest bid fails to make their bid, they lose a points equal to their bid. Their opponents get one point for each trick they take. Game is won by the first team to score 36 points. Scoring and No-Trump Variations Sometimes a scoring variation is the \\"big pepper\\" bid is worth 24 points. In these cases, the ending score is usually higher than the traditional 42. Another variation is calling High or Low instead of suit. In this variation, there are no trump jacks and everything must follow suit and order. If a player cannot follow suit (even if he/she has a lower card), he/she cannot take the trick. =Progressive Euchre= Progressive Euchre is a tournament format Euchre. Basics Play begins when the lead table rings a bell. The lead table plays 8 hands, the deal revolving to the left with each hand, so that each player has dealt twice, then rings the bell again. When the bell rings, players at each table finish their current hand, record their team score on an individual tally. The losing team at the head table moves to the tail table; otherwise the winning team at each table advances to the next table, and one member of the losing team changes seat so that partners in one game are opponents in the next game. Play begins on the next game immediately without waiting for another signal. After 10 games, players total their tally sheets, to determine high score and low score for the tournament. Game Each table of four players use a 24-card deck containing A K Q J 10 9 in the four suits ♠ ♣ . Players bid once each, clockwise around the table, starting at the dealer's left. Bids of one to six are made by stating the number of tricks to be taken. A bid of \\"pass\\" is most often shown by knocking on the table. A player must either bid higher than any prior bid, or pass. A pepper consists of winning all six tricks with a passed card. Typically, a pepper bid is signalled by holding the pass card face down and wagging it. If no succeeding player wishes to play a loner, the bidder declares suit by saying, \\"Give me your best heart\\", \\"Give me your best club\\", etc. His partner gives the requested card to the bidder, face down, before seeing the bidder's passed card, and sits out the rest of the hand. As loner bids - asserting that one will win all six tricks without assistance - are pre-emptive, they are typically made by declaring suit and leading out the first trick. High bidder declares suit as he leads out the first trick. The winner of each trick leads the following trick. Only suits may be declared trump; no-trump and low-no- trump declarations are not permitted. Scoring Teams score one point for 3 or 4 tricks, 2 points for all 5 tricks, 4 points for a loner. A team failing to achieve their number of tricks receives no points for any tricks won, and 2 points goes to other partners score. A euchre sweep nets 4 points. Deal passes around the table, clockwise, after each hand. Strategy and etiquette * Conversation is welcome in Progressive Euchre, as long as it does not slow play. * While the lead table consists of winners versus winners, rarely will someone who has spent the tournament at the lead table have a particularly high score, as that table is the first to stop playing in each game. * It is considered rude to deliberately lose while at the lead table, but failure to aggressively bid is simply considered conservative play. * On the team which remains at the table, the person who has been longest at the table is the one who remains seated, and the other person is the one who moves. Players advancing to a table may select either available seat. * Repeatedly going set will tend to make one unpopular, but so will playing so conservatively as to never go set. * Players who consistently have high scores are permitted to make innocent math errors to avoid always winning. It is considered unsportsmanlike for those who consistently have low scores to make innocent math errors that give them a higher total. =Pfeffer= The names Pfeffer, Hasenpfeffer, and Double Hasenpfeffer (also known as Hoss or Pepper), come from \\"Hasenpfeffer\\", a German dish of marinated and stewed trimmings of hare. Pfeffer, is a variation of Pepper and is played in the Midwest. Its primary difference is that the dealer is forced to make a 4 Trick Bid when all players pass in front of the dealer. This allows for a strategy of forcing teams to have to make bids, or stick the dealer. In addition, there are variations on No Trump Bids that force bidders to reconsider this type of bid. Preliminaries All preliminaries are as described above, for Pepper. Bidding & Naming Trump Each player, beginning at dealer's left, may either bid or pass. A bid is the number of tricks that a player wagers for his or her team to win and each bid must be higher than preceding it. Trump Bids are the numbers Four through Six, and Pfeffer a/k/a Double - Pfeffer (a bid to win all six tricks, alone). No Trump Bids are the numbers Five, Six, and Pfeffer (a bid to win all six tricks, alone). When three consecutive players pass, the dealer is stuck and gets to name any suit as trump, or may declare no trump. The minimum bid for a dealer is four tricks. Rank of cards All card hierarchies are the same as Pepper. Play Declarer (the player who wins the bid) declares trump. For Trump Bids, the player to the left of the dealer leads to the first trick and each player must follow suit if possible, otherwise may play any card. The trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, or by the highest trump if any were played. Note: Left Bower is not in the suit printed on its face, but of the trump suit. Winner of each trick leads to the next and play continues until all six tricks have been played. For No Trump Bids, the player to the right of the Declarer leads. Note: This is different from most, if not all, Pepper and Bid Euchre variations. Scoring & Winning For Non Pfeffer Bids, the team that declared trump scores one point for each trick taken if they took at least as many tricks as were bid. If the declaring team takes all 6 tricks, they get 6 points and the opposing are \\"set\\", lose 5 points and receive a Hickey. If the declaring team takes less than the number of tricks bid, they are \\"set\\", lose 5 points and receive a Hickey. For Pfeffer Bids, if the declaring team takes all 6 tricks, they get 12 points and the opposing team are \\"set\\", lose 5 points and receive a Hickey. If the declaring team fails to take all 6 tricks, they are set, lose 10 points and receive 2 Hickeys. In all cases, the opposing team simply scores one point for every trick they take. Deal then passes clockwise around the table. Game is to 42 points. In cases of a tie at 42, the bidding team wins. Negative scores are allowed and are referred as being in the hole. For purposes of betting, amounts are set for Game and Sets (Note: Sets are the total number of Hickeys on the scoresheet for the losing team), with Game generally twice the amount as Sets. Games ending with the losing team at 0 points or below, pay double. =Pepper, Midwest= An alternate Midwest version of Pepper, played for certain in Grinnell, Iowa, USA around 1987. Major differences are winning bidder's partner does not play the hand after trading a card. Opponents are allowed to \\"pass\\" playing the hand to avoid scoring penalties. Preliminaries Same as Pepper. Bidding Similar to Pfeffer: minimum bid is 4, dealer is forced to take a 4 bid should all other players pass (or opt to take 4 set to prevent opponents from gaining points). Small and Big (alternatively referred to as bidding 7 or 14) bids mean take all tricks. Bid winner is allowed to trade a card with partner. May choose to not pass a card and have partner play the hand. Note, Big bid means no passed card and partner does not play. Play Normal play except bidder's partner does not play, puts hand face down. Exception: will play if bidder chose to NOT trade a card. Bidder's partner never plays in a Big bid. Opponents now decide whether they will play the hand. Talk should be limited to \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\", no other table talk (some venues threatened removing ability to consume popcorn should this rule be broken). Bidder may lead first card while this decision is being made but is not required. Scoring Bidder scores 4,5 or 6 points for bids 4 through 6. Small is 7 points, Big is 14 points. Opponents get 1 point for each trick taken in bids 4-6. If opponents fail to get a single trick, they lose the same number of points as winning bidder gains. For example, opponents failing to take a trick in a 6 bid, bidder gets 6 points and opponent loses 6 points. Note: if opponents pass and don't play the hand, no points are awarded to them and bidder scores. In Small or Big, when bidder is set opponents gain 7 or 14 points and bidder loses 7 or 14 points. Again, opponents only score if they choose to play the hand. =Hasenpfeffer= Hasenpfeffer, also called Pepper, is a four-player partnership variation of Euchre played with a 24-card pack plus Joker. Six cards are dealt in batches of 3 and the rest are laid face down to one side. Bids are made numerically for the naming of trump, and declarer may name no trump in place of a single suit. If no one bids, the holder of the best Bower is obliged to bid three, and if it then proves to be the card out of play, the deal is annulled. The highest bidder announces trumps before play. The bidder's side scores 1 point per trick won, if this is not less than the bid, otherwise it loses 1 point per undertrick. The play goes up to 10 points. Competition to secure a call is very keen, since one stands to gain more than one stands to lose, but for that very reason the bidding is frequently pushed beyond the level of safety.The Complete Book of Card Games, Hubert Phillips, B. C. Westal, p. 182 =Buckpfeffer= A variation and combination of many bid euchre varieties, \\"BuckenPeffer\\" or simply \\"Buck\\", involves only one round of bids. The minimum bid is three. If all 3 players pass before the dealer, like in \\"Screw the Dealer\\", the dealer is forced to bid four tricks. There is no second round of bidding and dealer is then forced to bid four tricks. There is no bidding \\"Two\\" to inform a partner that the bidder is holding two jacks of the same color. You may call high or low as trump, but in this case (unless the player calling trump is going pfeff or pfeffer [going solo with no partner and must take all six tricks] if the bidder calls hi or low, he or she must exchange his best card (A if high is called, 9 if low is called) for the worst card (a 9 if high is called, A if low is called) from the player on the callers left. There are different scoring and waging rules such as burns, double burns and triple burns. Scoring is different in that teams, not individuals, are scored. Points awarded are number of tricks taken and the game is generally played to 25 or more. Scoring idiosyncrasies include: if a team takes all six tricks after calling trump, or skunking the other team, they score six plus the number of the tricks they bid. The skunked team has the number of the winning trump bid subtracted from their score. This version was definitely played in the Chaska, Minnesota USA area from 1986 through 1988, and also played at local universities attended by graduates of Chaska Senior High School in the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s. In 1988, the Principal of Chaska Senior High School permanently banned students from playing the game, basing his action on allegations of gambling and large sums of money being wagered and exchanged. =Dirty clubs= Dirty clubs, also called buck euchre, is a variation of euchre and 500 card game, and similar to Oh Hell – 500. Like euchre, these games are trick-taking card games; unlike euchre, the players must bid on how many tricks they will take. Rules Dirty clubs can be played by 3 to 6 players, depending on the variation. The game uses the same cards as euchre: the 10, J, Q, K, and A of each suit (three players), with lower cards (9, 8, 7, etc.) added if necessary for more players. The first hand, the dealer is chosen at random, then the deal proceeds clockwise. *Each hand, one suit is trump; trump cards are higher than non-trump. The order of cards for the trump suit is the same as euchre: J of the trump suit (right bauer)-J of the other suit of the same color (left bauer)-A-K-Q-10-etc. The order of cards for non-trump suits is A-K-Q-(J)-10-etc. *Each hand, five cards are dealt to each player; the remaining cards are placed face down (the blind), except the top card, which is flipped face up. If this face up card is a club - this is called dirty clubs - there is no bidding and clubs is automatically trump. Otherwise, each player in clockwise order bids a number of tricks they think they can take. The bid can go around a second time, giving players the chance to raise their bid. The high bidder gets to call trump. *Play begins with the player to the left of the dealer. This player leads with a single card, and play proceeds clockwise. Players must follow suit if possible. The player who takes the trick gets to lead for the next trick. Scoring Each player starts with the same number of points, which may be 15. The goal is to get to 0. Each player subtracts the number of tricks taken from his score each hand. However, the high bidder must take at least the number of tricks he bid. If he fails to take this many tricks, instead of subtracting points, he must add 5 to his score. Therefore, being the high bidder is helpful in that it lets you call trump, but it is also dangerous as you are the only player held to your bid. One variation is that a player who takes no tricks (is bumped) is penalized 5 points, regardless of his bid. When this rule is in place, the players are usually given a chance to drop out after trump is called. A player who drops out cannot be penalized, but also cannot take any tricks. Another variation is that if the call goes all the way around without a bid, there is no trump. Players do not get a chance to drop out. =Eau Claire Clubs= Eau Claire Clubs (also called Dirrties, Clübbérts, or simply Clubs) is similar to Dirty Clubs, with the most notable difference being that it is played with 4 players split into 2 partnerships, instead of “every player for themselves.” It follows the same general bidding, cardplay, and scoring rules as Dirty Clubs, with some exceptions. (E.g., Bottoms, Ace No Face, end-of-game scoring, terminology, et al.) History Eau Claire Clubs was popularized in the mid- to late-20th Century, most notably among the Eau Claire (Wis.) Memorial High School district, and especially among the Eau Claire MHS graduating classes of the late 1990s, as well as among members of the University Of Wisconsin-Eau Claire football team around the turn of the 21st Century. It was known to be played in MHS homerooms and study-halls as far back as 1996. Eau Claire Clubs figured prominently into the painting of UW-Eau Claire dormitory rooms during the summer of 2000. The game was so popular during this time that paint-crew members commonly returned to their homes during lunch breaks to get in a quick noon-game, and they would even resort to playing online Euchre during coffee breaks. With labor production having decreased noticeably, university authorities clamped down on the game; and painting superintendent Bill \\"The Coz\\" Macosek, along with his enforcer known only as \\"Randelt\\", began patrolling the grounds in a Cushman utility vehicle to ferret out Clubs activity among crew members. Using such tactics as the Backdoor Sneak-In, the Double Back, the Window Peep, no-knock entries to locked rooms, and stealth Cushman maneuvers, these Clubs antagonists forced the paint-crew card games underground, where they nonetheless continued unabated, prison-style, aided by the fashioning of crude bootleg decks out of loose-leaf paper. Cards A deck of 24 cards containing A, K, Q, J, 10, 9 of each suit (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs) The card rankings are the same as for Euchre: * Trump suit: “Jack” (a.k.a. right bower), “Jick” (a.k.a. left bower), A, K, Q, 10, 9 * Side (non-trump) suits: A, K, Q, J*, 10, 9 *The side suit of the same color as the trump suit is missing its jack, which is serving as the Jick When playing the hand at notrump, there are no bowers — all four suits follow the ranking of A, K, Q, J, 10, 9 Dealing Players each receive 5 cards. Cards are NOT dealt one at a time, but typically in groups of 1, 2, 3, or 4, until each player has 5 cards. (E.g., each player might receive 2 cards, then 3 more cards the next time around the table, for a total of 5 cards.) The first cards go to the player to the left of the dealer, and the deal proceeds clockwise around the table. Whichever player deals the current hand, the player to their left deals the next hand. After all the cards are dealt, the dealer places the remaining 4 cards face-down, and flips the top one up — this is the “up-card”. If the up-card is a club, then clubs are trump for that hand, and no bidding occurs. If the up-card is not a club, bidding proceeds as described in the Bidding section below. A key difference from Euchre is that the up-card never gets \\"picked up\\"; rather, it stays on the top of the pile the entire hand. Before the first hand of the game, a player from each partnership cuts into the deck. The player with the highest cut-card deals the first hand. (This matters because being the dealer confers a slight advantage, in that the dealer bids last.) Another method for deciding who deals first is to deal the cards one at a time, face-up and clockwise around the table — the first player to receive a black jack (or any other agreed-upon card) begins as dealer. Bidding If the up-card is NOT a club: Each player gets one bid, and one bid only. The player may pass, or bid for the partnership to take some number of tricks. The player to the left of the dealer opens the bidding. The bid proceeds clockwise around the table. Besides ‘pass’, a player has 7 possible bids: * 2 (this is a bid for the partnership to take 2 tricks in a trump-suit to be named later) * 3 * 4 * 5 * 3 notrump (a.k.a. 3NT — this is a bid to take 3 tricks at notrump) * 4NT * 5NT Ensuing players may pass, or they may outbid the high bidder thus far. A player may outbid their partner, if they so choose. The rules of outbidding are as follows: * Any higher trump- suit bid beats any lower trump-suit bid (i.e., 5 beats 4 beats 3 beats 2) * A bid of 3NT or 4NT is beaten by any trump-suit bid (i.e., 2+ beats 3NT or 4NT) * A bid of 5NT is beaten by a trump-suit bid of 3 or more (i.e., 3+ beats 5NT) After each player has bid (or passed), the contract is awarded to the partnership with the highest bid. For example, if the bidding went “4NT-2-Pass-3”, then the dealer’s partnership would be contracted to take 3 tricks. After the bidding auction concludes, the high bidder calls the trump suit. In the example above, the dealer would call the trump suit after bidding ‘3’. The high bidder may call any trump suit, regardless of the suit of the up-card. (This is another difference from Euchre, where players cannot call trump in the suit of the up-card.) “Sitting out” After the contract is awarded, the defenders may elect to “sit out”. In this case, the bidding partnership earn points equal to their bid, and the defenders’ score remains the same. For example, the defenders might elect to sit out if they deem it likely that they will be set. If the defenders sit out, the hand is over, the score is adjusted, and the deal proceeds to the next hand. There are 2 situations where a partnership is prohibited from sitting out: * If they have sat out the 2 previous hands (i.e., a team cannot sit out 3 hands in a row) * If their score is 3, 2, or 1 If the up-card IS a club: There is no bidding; instead, the hand is played with clubs as trump. Both partnerships must play — no sitting out. Players may not call Bottoms, Ace No Face, or 4 Of A Kind misdeal. The player to the left of the dealer leads to the opening trick. The cardplay proceeds as per the rules for when there is a trump suit. Cardplay If the opponents elect to play the hand (not sit out), the winning bidder leads to the opening trick. A common strategy is to lead trump and begin drawing out trumps — but, this is by no means always the best strategy. When there is a trump suit, cardplay is the same as in Euchre & most trick-taking card games — players must follow suit if they can, any trump is stronger than any non-trump, players may trump in or discard if they cannot follow suit, the trick-winner leads to the next trick, etc. When the hand is played at notrump, cardplay is the same as a notrump hand in bridge — card- rank is A-K-Q-J-10-9 [no bowers], the first card led to each trick is the “trump suit” for that trick, players must follow suit if they can, the trick- winner leads to the next suit, etc. After the 5th and final trick of the hand, the partnership’s “trick total” for that hand equals the sum of the tricks taken by each partner. Set (a.k.a. Setpie) A partnership are set (a.k.a. “bumped”) if either of the following occurs: * The partnership take zero tricks during the hand * As bidders, the partnership’s trick total is lower than their bid (e.g., they bid 4 but only took 3 tricks) In the event of a set (a.k.a. a “setpie”), the partnership’s score is increased by 5, up to a maximum of 20. Furthermore, there may be betting consequences associated with a set — this depends on the stakes of the particular game in question. Scoring The game begins with both partnerships at 15. The score is updated after each hand. If the defenders’ trick-total is 1 or greater, their trick total is subtracted from their score. If the defenders’ trick-total is zero, they are “set”, and 5 points are added to their score, up to a maximum score of 20. If the bidders made their bid, their trick total is subtracted from their score. For example, if a team bids 2 and ends up taking 4 tricks, then 4 is subtracted from their score. If the bidders took fewer tricks than their bid, they are set, and 5 points are added to their score, up to a maximum of 20. If the up-card was a club, and one partnership take all 5 tricks, then 5 points are subtracted from that partnership’s score — meanwhile, the other team is set, and 5 points are added to their score, up to a maximum of 20 points. Winning The winning side is the first partnership who achieve a score of zero (or negative). If both partnerships reach zero on the same hand, then “bidder wins” — i.e., the win goes to whichever partnership were the bidders on the final hand. Thus, the winners are not always the team with the lowest score: For example, if the score were 2-1, and the team with 2 were to bid & make 2, the official score after the hand would be zero to negative-2 — however, because “bidder wins”, the team with zero would win the game. If both partnerships reach zero on the same hand AND the final hand is played with a club as the up-card (i.e., no official bidder), then the winners are the team with the lower score after the hand. If the scores are tied after the hand, then the winners are the team with the higher trick-total on the final hand.  Bottoms  (NOTE: Disallowed if the up-card is a club.) If a player’s hand contains 3 cards of the same value (e.g., three 9’s), the player may call “Bottoms”. Then, the player exchanges their 3 of a kind for the 3 cards on the bottom of the pile. The 3 of a kind are shown face-up, for all to see; and then they are placed face-up beneath the up-card. The player must call Bottoms before he bids/passes. Additionally, the “official” rule is that a player must call Bottoms before anybody else bids/passes — at the table, however, this rule is often loosened to allow judgment calls. (For example, if the player to the left of the dealer were to bid quickly, before the next player had even picked up his hand, and then the player in 2nd seat were to call Bottoms, it may be allowed.) As with many/most borderline situations in Clubs, close calls are left to the discretion of the players at the table and any respected observers on hand. Misdeal In the situation of a misdeal, all cards are returned to the dealer, and the dealer shuffles & deals again. Besides the usual misdeal situations (cards dealt out of order, not all players received 5 cards, upturned card during the deal, missing cards, etc.), there are two special situations where a misdeal may occur : 4 Of A Kind (misdeal): If a player’s hand contains 4 of a kind (e.g., four 9’s), the player may call “misdeal”. The official timing-rules are the same as for Bottoms (i.e., must be called before anybody has bid/passed.) _If the up-card is a club, then 4 Of A Kind misdeal is disallowed._ Ace No Face (misdeal): If a player’s hand contains 1+ aces and no face-cards, the player may call “Ace No Face”. This triggers a misdeal. The official timing- rules for Ace No Face are the same as for Bottoms. _If the up-card is a club, then Ace No Face is disallowed._ Rules around Ace No Face vary from game to game, and they are perhaps the most hotly debated subject on the Clubs circuit. Often, they depend on the particular geographic location of where the game is played — some places commonly restrict Ace No Face to only the precise holding of A-10-10-9-9 (exactly one ace and no opportunity to call Bottoms); by contrast, other places allow players to call Ace No Face on any hand with no face cards. For example, Clubs games played in the lower Third Ward of Eau Claire, Wis., commonly adhere to the more rigid, “A-10-10-9-9 only” variant — by contrast, games occurring elsewhere (notably, those held in the Memorial High School library during study hall, and also in the Washington Street area of Eau Claire) are often less strict and allow a more liberal interpretation of Ace No Face. The player's hand may afford the option to call either misdeal or Bottoms -- in this case, the decision is left to the player, who may elect to kill the hand then & there (via misdeal) or test Lady Luck by calling Bottoms.  Betting  Commonly there are stakes associated with winning the game, and also with each set. Around the turn of the 21st Century, the typical stakes were \\"Buck A Game, Fifty Cents A Set\\" -- i.e., $1.00 USD paid to the winners of the game, plus $0.50 USD paid for each setpie. Double Deck Bid Euchre =Indiana Double Deck= This version of Double Deck Bid Euchre is commonly played in the Midwest United States. A complete treatment of the rules and strategy is given in. Players & Cards The game is played by 4 players in teams of 2. A deck of 48 cards (a Pinochle Deck which consists of two of each card, 9 to Ace, in all 4 suits) is used. Dealing All cards are shuffled and dealt out clockwise. The hand is traditionally dealt out in groups of 2 and/or 3 cards, but this is not required. Bidding Starting from the dealer's left and proceeding clockwise, players can bid to determine the trump suit by naming the number of tricks they think they can take and the suit they want to be trump (e.g., “4 Hearts” or “6 Spades”). The person to the dealer's left must bid a minimum of 3 of something (either a suit or No- Trump). Subsequent players can pass, bid their own suit, or try to “back” their partner in the partner's suit by adding to the partner's bid. If a suit is bid, the next bid must be greater than it. If No-Trump is bid, the next bid can match it if in a suit. If the next bid is in No-Trump also, then it must be greater than the previous No-Trump bid. Players may bid multiple times until there are 3 consecutive passes. A player who has passed may re-enter the bidding on any of the player's subsequent turns. Once there are 3 consecutive passes, the player who bid last wins the bid for their team. Play Once a bid is won, the person who won the bid leads first. Play proceeds clockwise. Players must follow suit if possible, and may trump if they are void in a suit, or throw off (play a non-trump card in a suit that was not led). The highest card played of the suit that is led first wins the trick, unless trump is played. In this case, the highest trump played wins the trick. If 2 of the same cards are played on a trick (e.g., two Aces of Hearts), the first one played beats the second one played. The player who wins the trick leads the next trick. Scoring If the team that won the bid got the number of tricks they bid, or more, they get points equal to their bid. For example, if the winning bid is 8 Hearts but the team actually takes 10 tricks, they only get 8 points. If the team that wins the bid takes less tricks than the number they bid, they are “set” or “euchred” and their score is reduced by the number they bid. For example, if after taking an 8 Hearts bid the team only gets 7 tricks, they would lose 8 points from their score. The team that does not take the bid gets 1 point for every trick taken, whether or not the opponents make their bid. Winning The deal continues clockwise around the table until one team gets 50 or more points. If both teams get 50 or more points on the same hand, the team that took the bid is the winner. =Five-handed= A five- handed variation played in Florida with two decks with nines removed. Each player competes against all the others. This variation can also be played by six, seven or more players, following the same rules. For each player above five, eight cards must be added to the deck. If six play, eight nines are added, four from each of the two decks; for seven players, add the nines and eights from both decks. Dealing Unlike standard Euchre in which each player receives five cards, each player receives eight cards. The cards are dealt clockwise starting with the player sitting to the left of the dealer until all cards are dealt; there are no remaining cards and hence, no kitty. By tradition, cards are dealt in groups of two or three to each player. Bidding Bidding begins with the player seated clockwise next to the dealer. Each player, in turn, bids the number of tricks they believe they can win. Each bid must be a \\"pass\\" or a higher number of tricks than already bid. The minimum bid is one trick and the maximum is eight tricks. Bidding proceeds once around the table and ends with the dealer. The player who has bid the highest number of tricks wins the bid and becomes the bidding player. The bidding player then names the trump suit and selects their partner by naming a card. The player who is the first to play the selected card becomes the bidder's partner for the hand, and if the card is not played, there is no partner. Players, including the bidder, are unaware of the partner's identity until the selected card is played. The remaining players become the opposition, sometimes called the defense. Once around the players for bid is given and if no one bids the dealer must accept a bid of six for his hand. Playing the hand Each hand consists of eight tricks. The hand starts with a lead from the bidding player. Following the lead, each player must follow suit if possible. If suit can not be followed, the player may play any card. A player with the card selected by the bidder must play it at the earliest opportunity in the hand (typically, on the first trick) unless it has already been played by another player. After all players have played a card, the player who played the highest-ranking card is declared the trick winner and the trick is cleared faced down. The highest-ranking card is determined as: the highest-ranking trump played, if no trump was played then the highest- ranking card in the suit initially lead. If there are two highest-ranking cards on a trick (because a double-deck is used), the first one played wins the trick. The trick winner then leads a card for the next trick. Players may ask to see the last trick played. Scoring the hand Since teams shift from one hand to the next, each player maintains an individual score. Each player on the bidding team (bidder plus partner) receives one point for each trick taken, unless the team takes fewer than the number of tricks bid. In that case, the bidding team is \\"euchred\\" and the number of tricks bid is subtracted from their score. Each player on the defense receives one point for each trick taken by the defense, that is, the number of tricks not taken by the bidding team. Each player's score is calculated at the completion of each hand. The game ends when the deal has passed around the table twice, that is, ten hands have been played. The player with the highest number of points is declared the winner. Another way of ending the game is by specifying the number of points, mutually agreed before the game started. Twenty-one is a common game-winning score. Strategy # Avoid helping the player in the lead (or any other player for that matter). # During bidding, you can usually bid one trick for each jack or ace of trump in your hand. # If you have at least one jack of each suit, you may decide to \\"pass\\" during bidding, because it is more advantageous to become the bidder's partner. # Most of the time, when making trump, you will ask for the highest trump card not in your hand as your partner. # The bidder usually names a trump in which they have the right bower. # If the bidder has only one right bower, it is good to ask for the right bower and then lead a small trump on the first trick. Your partner will then take the trick with the right bower, allowing you to save your right bower for later in the hand. # The defense should work together to take tricks. It is generally not good strategy to overtake a trick on which the defense already has the highest-ranking card. # If you taunt your opponent into bidding partner’s best and you lose, it’s best not to do that a second time in the same evening and risk losing the entire night and earning your partner’s sighs of disapproval! =Double Hasenpfeffer= A variant for either 4 or 6 players divided into two teams and using the 48-card pinochle pack. Double Hasenpfeffer, or Double Pepper, may be played without bowers, so all cards rank A K Q J 10 9 in each suit, and there are no bids of Little and/or Big Pepper. All cards are dealt out and bidding goes around the table only once, the minimum bid being 6. If all pass, dealer names trump at a minimum bid of 6 tricks. In a 4-player game, high bidder may opt to play alone and exchange any two cards with his or her partner and then play solo against the opposing team. Scoring is as 24-card pepper above, with a forced declaration by the dealer losing only half (rounding up) if not made. Playing alone scores double, positive if bid is made, or negative if not.

It was led by Sir Francis Drake as admiral and Sir John Norreys as general, and failed to drive home the advantage England had won upon the failure of the Spanish Armada in the previous year. The Spanish victory marked a revival of Philip II's naval power through the next decade.  Background  After the failure of the Spanish Armada, Queen Elizabeth I's intentions were to capitalise upon Spain's temporary weakness at sea and to compel Philip II to sue for peace. The expedition had three objectives: to burn the Spanish Atlantic fleet (that was being repaired in ports of northern Spain), to make a landing at Lisbon and raise a revolt there against Philip II (Philip I of Portugal), and then to continue west and establish a permanent base in the Azores. A further aim was to seize the Spanish treasure fleet as it returned from America to Cádiz, although this depended largely on the success of the Azores campaign. Elizabeth I of England The strategic objective of the military expedition was to break the trade embargo imposed across the Portuguese empire, which included Brazil and the East Indies, among other areas, and trading posts in India and China. By securing an alliance with the Portuguese crown, Elizabeth hoped to curb Spanish Habsburg power in Europe and to free up the trade routes to these possessions. This was a difficult proposition, because Philip had been accepted as king by the aristocracy and clergy of Portugal in 1581 at the Cortes of Tomar. The pretender to the throne, António, Prior of Crato — the last surviving heir of the House of Aviz — failed to establish an effective government in exile in the Azores, and turned to the English for support. He was not a charismatic figure, and with his cause compromised by his illegitimacy, he faced an opponent with a relatively strong claim to the throne in the eyes of the Portuguese nobles of the Cortes, Duchess Catherine of Braganza. The complex politics were not the only obstacle for the enterprise. Like its Spanish predecessor, the English expedition suffered from unduly optimistic planning, based on hopes of repeating Drake's successful raid on Cadiz in 1587. There was a contradiction between the separate plans, each of which was ambitious in its own right, but the most pressing need was the destruction of the Spanish Atlantic fleet lying at port in Corunna, San Sebastián and Santander along the northern coast of Spain, as directly ordered by the Queen. The expedition was floated as a joint stock company, with capital of about £80,000 — one quarter to come from the Queen, and one eighth from the Dutch, the balance to be made up by various noblemen, merchants and guilds. The treasurer was Sir James Hales (died 1589), who died on the return journey, as is recorded on his monument in Canterbury Cathedral. Concerns over logistics and adverse weather delayed the departure of the fleet, and confusion grew as it waited in port. The Dutch failed to supply their promised warships, a third of the victuals had already been consumed, and the number of veteran soldiers was only 1,800 while the ranks of volunteers had increased the planned contingent of troops from 10,000 to 19,000. Unlike the Spanish Armada expedition of the previous year, the English fleet also lacked siege guns and cavalry, which could compromise its intended aims.  Execution  When the fleet sailed it was made up of six royal galleons, 60 English armed merchantmen, 60 Dutch flyboats and about 20 pinnaces. In addition to the troops, there were 4,000 sailors and 1,500 officers and gentlemen adventurers. Drake assigned his vessels to five squadrons, led respectively by himself in the Revenge, Sir John Norreys in the Nonpareil, Norreys' brother Edward in the Foresight, Thomas Fenner in the Dreadnought, and Roger Williams in the Swiftsure. Also sailing with them — against the Queen's express orders — was the Earl of Essex. Most of the ships lost in Philip II's expedition of 1588 had been armed merchantmen, while the core of the Armada — the galleons of the Squadron of Portugal of the Armada del Mar Oceano (Atlantic Fleet) — survived their voyage home and docked in Spain's Atlantic ports for a refit, where they lay for months, vulnerable to attack. =Coruña= Unforeseen delays, many of them related to Drake's own fear of becoming embayed in the Bay of Biscay, led Drake to bypass Santander, where most of this refitting was under way. He alleged unfavourable winds and turned to attack Corunna (Coruña) in Galicia. It is not fully clear why, but he may have been motivated by a false contemporary legend that a tower in Corunna held a fabulous treasure of gold coins, or he may have just been looking for supplies. Sir Francis Drake, commander of the English Armada Corunna was almost defenceless at the time of the attack. To face the English Armada's 150 ships plus boats, and the soldiers in them, Corunna had one galleon (San Juan, with 50 cannons), two galleys (Diana and Princesa, with 20 cannons each), and two other smaller ships (nao San Bartolomé with 20 cannons, and the unarmed urca Sansón and galeoncete (small galleon) San Bernardo). A combination of militia, hidalgos and the few available soldiers totalled 1,500 soldiers, most of them with little military training, except for seven companies of old tercios who happened to be resting in the city after their return from war. It also had the medieval city walls, built in the 13th century. Gorrochategui Santos (2011+2018) Norreys took the lower town, inflicted 500 casualties, and plundered the wine cellars there, while Drake destroyed thirteen merchant ships in the harbour. For the next two weeks the wind blew westerly, and while waiting for a change the English occupied themselves in a siege of Corunna's fortified upper town. They launched three major assaults against the walls of the upper town, and tried to breach them with mines, but the vigorous defence by the regular Spanish troops, militia, and women of the city including Maria Pita and Inés de Ben Valcarcel, Isabel. Mujeres De Armas Tomar (Women-At-Arms). Madrid: Algaba, 2004. forced the English back with severe losses.(2018: pp.77–97) The Princesa and the Diana managed to avoid capture and slip past the English fleet repeatedly to resupply the defenders. After 14 days of siege and attempted assaults, on the 18th, the English heard news about Spanish reinforcements on their way to Corunna, and at length, with a favourable wind returning and painfully low morale, the English abandoned the siege and retreated to their ships, having lost four captains, three large ships,Rodríguez González, Agustín Ramón (2006).Victorias por mar de los españoles. Madrid: Biblioteca de Historia, Grafite Ediciones various boats and more than 1,500 men in the fighting alone, along with 3,000 other personnel in 24 of the transports. This included many of the Dutch who found reasons to return to England or put into La Rochelle.(2018: pp.77–97) The next step in Elizabeth's plan was to stir a Portuguese uprising against King Philip. The Portuguese aristocracy had recognised him as King of Portugal in 1580, adding the Kingdom of Portugal to the Hispanic Monarchy. The pretender to the throne that England supported, the Prior of Crato, was not an ideal candidate. He did not have enough support even to establish a government in exile, nor much charisma to back his already dubious claim. Elizabeth had agreed to help him in hopes of diminishing the power of the Spanish Empire in Europe, and in exchange for a permanent military base in the strategic Azores Islands from which to attack merchant ships and ultimately obtain control of the commercial routes to the New World. =Portugal= On May 6, Drake arrived at Peniche, in Portugal, which was handed to them by supporters of Crato. After that, they headed towards Lisbon, 11,000 men and 110 ships at this point. Owing partially to poor organisation and lack of coordination (they had very few siege guns) the invading force failed to take Lisbon from the garrison of 7,000 Portuguese and Spanish soldiers and 40 ships guarding it. The expected uprising by the Portuguese loyal to Crato never materialised.Wernham (1951b)(pp.204–214) English galleon Ark Royal from 1587 Lisbon was rumoured to be guarded by a disaffected garrison, but whilst the English were fruitlessly besieging Corunna, the Spanish had spent a fortnight shoring up Portugal's military defences. When Norreys invaded Lisbon, the expected uprising was not forthcoming and little was achieved. Drake did take the opportunity on 30 June of seizing a fleet of 20 French and 60 Hanseatic ships which had broken the English blockade on trade with Spain by sailing all around the north of Scotland, only to fetch up before the English cannon in the mouth of the Tagus. This seizure, notes R. B. Wernham, \\"dealt a useful blow to Spanish preparations\\",(p.204) but later required a publicly printed justification, a Declaration of Causes, from the Queen's own printer, as, without booty, she and her fellow English investors faced considerable losses. The English dealt a further blow to Spanish naval preparations and food supplies by destroying the Lisbon granaries but, despite the bravado of Essex, who thrust a sword in at the gates of the city with a challenge to the defenders, the English could not take the city without artillery. Neither did they receive substantial support from the Portuguese.(p.214, pp.210–11) The expected uprising failed to occur, in part because of the absence of Drake, the land and naval forces having divided and being out of contact after the landing at Peniche, and the defenders would not risk battle.(pp.210–11) Philip II of Spain Essex received orders from Elizabeth to return to court, along with a refusal to send reinforcements or a siege train, the queen having no desire to carry the main burden of a land war in Portugal. It was therefore decided to concentrate on the third aim of the expedition: the establishment of a permanent military base in the Azores. However, by this point the campaign had taken its toll. Drake's forces had initially caught the Spanish authorities off guard, but Spain had now marshalled her defences, and the English expedition's strength was wearing down, and suffering increasingly from disease. Two armed merchantmen were caught off Lisbon by nine Spanish galleys, commanded by Alonso de Bazán. One of them, the William, was saved by Revenge after being abandoned by her crew, but the ship did not have enough manpower aboard to sail away after the battle and had to be scuttled to prevent her falling into the hands of the Spanish again. The other vessel was engulfed in flames after a fight, and sunk, her commander Captain Minshaw being lost with the ship. Further damage was sustained when one of three boats carrying William's complement was lost with all hands after being attacked by the Spanish warships.Cummins, John (1997).Francis Drake: Lives of a Hero. Palgrave Macmillan, p. 217 With the attack on the Azores becoming out of the question, Drake made a final attempt to retrieve the mission. At this point, most of his men were out of action, with only 2,000 still fit to be mustered. Stormy weather had also damaged a number of the ships. While Norreys sailed for home with the sick and wounded, Drake took his pick of what was left and set out with 20 ships to hunt for the Spanish treasure fleet. While lying in wait for it his naval force was struck by another heavy storm which left him unable to continue, and while raiding and plundering Porto Santo in Madeira in compensation his flagship the Revenge sprang a leak due to storm damage and almost foundered as she led the remainder of the fleet home to Plymouth. Aftermath Map of the English Armada campaigns. The English fleet lost about 40 ships, plus the 18 launches destroyed or captured at Corunna and Lisbon. Fourteen of the ships were lost directly to the actions of Spanish naval forces: three at Corunna; six were lost to actions led by Padilla, three to Bazán and two to Aramburu. The rest were lost to a stormy sea as the fleet made its return voyage to England. The outbreak of disease on board the vessels was also transmitted to the port town populations in England on its return. None of the campaign's aims had been accomplished, and for a number of years this expedition's results discouraged further joint-stock adventures on such a scale.( p.214)Wagner (2002) p.242 The English expeditionary force had sustained a heavy loss of ships, troops and resources, but only brought back 150 captured cannon and £30,000 of plunder, and had not inflicted decisive damage on the Spanish forces. Another indirect minor strategic benefit was, perhaps, a temporary disruption to Spanish military shipping activity, and the diversion of Spanish imperial resources that might have contributed to a mutiny by troops under the command of Parma in Flanders that August. The most detailed account (in English), written in the form of a letter by an anonymous participant, was published in 1589: A true Coppie of a Discourse written by a Gentleman, employed in the late Voyage of Spain and Portingale... which set out openly to restore the credit of the participants. However, this English narrative has been shown to have been a highly effective means to bury the magnitude of the disaster.(2018: p.224) With the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against the weakened Spanish navy lost, the failure of the expedition depleted the financial resources of England's treasury, which had been carefully restored during the long reign of Elizabeth I. The war was financially costly to both of its protagonists, and the Spanish Empire—which was fighting France and the United Provinces at the same time—would be compelled in financial distress to default on its debt repayments in 1596 following another raid by the English on Cadiz. Two more armadas in 1596 and 1597 were sent by Spain against England, but both were scattered by storms en route.Tenace (2003) Peace was finally agreed between the two powers at the signing of the Treaty of London in 1604.

Overview Completed in 1951 and serving as Israel's largest stadium ever since, this all-seated stadium contains 41,583 seats while 13,370 of which are located in the Western Tribune completed in 1982 – at the time the stadium went through a major refurbishing process. The stadium is mixed-use, fit for athletic competitions alongside its more regular usage as a football stadium when it hosts Israel international football matches along with the home UEFA Champions League matches of Maccabi Tel Aviv and Maccabi Haifa in the 2004–05 and 2009–10 seasons, respectively. The pitch dimensions are 105 m × 68 m (115 × 74 yd), with a lawn. The stadium's plot area is . The stadium also contains six dressing rooms, meeting halls, a conference center, press rooms, referees' room and medical and drug-test clinics. It is sided by two training fields, large athletes clinic, a café- restaurant, and a 3,900 space open-air car park. It also houses the headquarters of the Israel Football Association. The artificial lighting conditions in the stadium are on the same level with the world's top stadiums, offering a max 1,550 lux on every part of the pitch. Until the opening of Sammy Ofer Stadium in Haifa, it was the only stadium in Israel which was world-class standard, and the only one to host official FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and UEFA Champions League games, although Hapoel Tel Aviv got permission to stage their 2010 Champions League games at the Bloomfield Stadium. The stadium was also the location for opening ceremonies of the Maccabiah Games, but from 2013, the location for opening ceremonies is Teddy Stadium Jerusalem. With the more modern Sammy Ofer Stadium and Teddy Stadium replacing it as alternative homes for the Israel National Football Team, as of today (2018) the stadium remains largely abandoned as a venue for football games. According to IFA former president Avi Luzon, there are plans to tear down the stadium and rebuild a larger one with expected capacity of 55,000 people. But by the end of 2016 it was not established. Entertainment The stadium has hosted musical acts such as Depeche Mode, Elton John, R.E.M., Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Leonard Cohen, Sting, High on Fire, Orphaned Land, Metallica, Simon and Garfunkel, Bob Dylan and Kanye West. In 2012 Madonna opened her MDNA Tour at the stadium, playing in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 33,000 people.

It is a cult film of the Cool Cymru era of arts in Wales. The film explores themes of coming of age, drug and club cultures, as well as relationships. It includes scenes provoking social commentary and the use of archive footage to provide political commentary. The plot of the film revolves around five twenty-something friends and their wider work and social circle, the latter devotees of the club scene, taking place over the course of a drug-fuelled weekend in Cardiff, Wales. A central feature is the avoidance of moralising about the impact of 1990s dance lifestyle; instead the film concentrates on recreating the \\"vibe, the venues and the mood\\" of the dance movement from the 1988–89 \\"second summer of love\\" to the film's release in 1999.Human Traffic DVD copyright Prism Leisure 2003 EAN: 5014293134552 In the first 25 minutes of the film Lee, the 17-year-old brother of central character Nina, enthuses \\"I am about to be part of the chemical generation\\" and lists, using the slang of the period, a series of drugs that he might experiment with later that night. The film is narrated by one of the stars, John Simm, featuring numerous cameo appearances. It is also the film debut of Danny Dyer as well as referencing another drug culture film of the era, Trainspotting. With an original budget of £340,000,The Guardian, 18 October 2002 – online version no longer available, cached version at the production eventually came in for £2,200,000; the film was a financial success, taking in £2,500,000 at the UK box office alone, also enjoying good VHS and DVD sales. Human Traffic was critically well-received with largely positive reviews, and has achieved cult status, especially amongst subcultures such as the rave culture. A sequel, known as Human Traffic 2: Revolution was announced in April 2019 and is due for release at an unknown date. Dyer, Parkes and Reynolds are due to reprise their roles. Synopsis The film is an ensemble piece in which the five protagonists plan, enjoy and come down from a weekend out in Cardiff; all motivated at least in part by the need for a weekend escape from the difficulties and contradictions of their daily lives. Jip is suffering from sexual anxiety brought on by a series of unsuccessful liaisons. Koop, Jip's best friend, is jealous of his girlfriend Nina's popular and happy-go-lucky nature. Nina is being sexually harassed in a job she had no choice but to take after having failed a college interview. Lulu, Jip's best female friend and \\"dropping partner\\", has suffered infidelity in her last 3 relationships. Moff, the newest member of the group having met Jip at a warehouse party after moving from London to Cardiff, is an unemployed slacker who scrapes a living as a small-time dealer, despite his father being a senior policeman. The five friends become very close, take drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine, and \\"live for the weekend\\". The film follows the exploits of the five friends as well as various characters they meet along the way. They go to pubs and clubs on Friday, taking along Nina's 17-year-old brother Lee whose waning enthusiasm for his first drugs experience is played out in a cameo debate between Jip and a doctor. Jip gives up his ticket to Lulu, whom he has talked into coming out and is forced to talk his way into the club as the group are a ticket short. The club scene is then examined through a series of cameos including two attempts by older journalists to understand the club scene. The ensemble then joins a house party, where Lulu and Jip finally kiss and attempt unsuccessfully to make love; whereas the established couple, Koop and Nina, argue over Koop's perceptions about her behaviour. Later, as expected by the group, \\"what goes up must come down\\" sets in as the effects of their drug use begin to hit home leaving them coping with feelings of illness and paranoia. They recover Lee from a group of younger partygoers he has spent the night with and make their way home. On returning home, some of the group's issues are resolved whilst some are thrown into sharper relief. Jip makes love to Lulu, overcoming his sexual paranoia. Koop and Nina's issues are set aside. Lee has made it through the weekend without any of his concerns being realised. Moff, however, is still caught up in the paranoia caused by his extensive drug use. He argues with his parents again and is seen walking alone around Cardiff looking disheartened. However, Moff joins his friends for an end of the weekend drink and having raged about his difficulties with drugs is soon joking about his excesses with his friends. The film finishes with Jip and Lulu kissing in the street in the manner of classic Hollywood films.

Production =Concept= 25 years old at the time, Welsh filmmaker Justin Kerrigan wrote the film along with producer Allan Niblo, Kerrigan's teacher and \\"mentor\\" at Newport film school. Kerrigan wanted the film to be as realistic as possible in depicting young people's lives in contemporary Britain, as well as realistically portraying drug culture and club culture, both walks of life in which Kerrigan had experience in. Kerrigan based much of the film on his own exploits, and eventually took over in a director capacity. In an edition of UK gay lifestyle magazine Attitude, actor Danny Dyer spoke about the film being partly inspired by the 1995 BBC television drama Loved Up (which also featured an early appearance from Lena Headey), and which had similar themes to the film. =Locations= Much of the film was shot in Cardiff, where the film also takes place. Nina's workplace, a fictionalised McDonald's, was filmed at UCI 12 Cinemas (Now an Odeon Cinema), Atlantic Wharf Leisure Village, Hemingway Road. The public house during the Friday night scene was shot at the Firedrake & Firkin Pub, 39-41 Salisbury Road, Cathays, Cardiff. The Emporium nightclub on Cardiff High Street was used as the exterior of the fictional \\"Asylum\\" club, and the former Club X, Charles Street stood in as the interior. The Philharmonic public house on St Mary's Street is where the Sunday pub scene was filmed, and Jip and Lulu's Sunday night walk home was also filmed in St Mary's Street. Themes =Alienation= Inter-generation alienation is a significant theme of the film including being directly referenced in a pub scene in which the main, minor and bit players sing a revised version of the United Kingdom national anthem 38 minutes into the film. Many of the characters have family troubles which cause conflict with family members. Jip's mother is a prostitute; Koop's father lives in a fantasy world under residential psychiatric care since his wife left him. Moff still lives at home and is shown as being in continual tension with his father and embarrassed when he is caught masturbating by his mother. The family relationships of the female leads are explored in less detail, although one scene portrays Lulu giving only limited details of her weekend to an uncle and aunt who are dressed as clergy. At least one contemporary review suggests that these relationships are not adequately explored in the film. =Work and unemployment= The film is also indifferent to the work ethic. Jip works at a clothing retail outlet and is comedically represented as a 'wage slave'; particularly in a scene where he is shown being anally raped by his boss, who has a barcode on his forehead and forcibly covers Jip's mouth with a £20 note. Nina has similar misgivings about her job at a fast-food restaurant where all the employees are shown bodypopping robotically and she quits her work following sexual harassment. Moff argues with his father about preferring to be unemployed whilst Lulu is shown not enjoying her college experience. =Drugs and the counter culture= All the characters identify strongly with the 1990s counter-culture: all are drug users to a greater or lesser extent; Jip idolises Bill Hicks; Koop dreams of being a DJ; Moff's bedroom is festooned with anti-establishment posters. Lulu gives an extended speech about her individuality whilst Nina revels in becoming unemployed. Jip concludes his narration by saying \\"We're all fucked up in our own way, y'know, but we're all doing it together. We're freestylin' on the buckle wheel of life, trapped in a world of internal dialogue. Like Bill Hicks said: 'It's an insane world, but I'm proud to be part of it.'\\" Although there is significant dialogue about drug use contained in the film (specifically MDMA (ecstasy), marijuana, and one sarcastic discussion about heroin and crack cocaine), the only drug use by main characters is a scene where Jip and Koop are having an intimate conversation at a house party and they are seen cutting up a line of white powder. They are never actually shown snorting it, but nonchalantly rub it into their gums during a discussion. Later at the same party Nina and Lulu are seen sharing a spliff on a balcony and Ernie, one of the protagonist's in Howard Marks' monologue 'Spliff Politics' is also seen smoking a large spliff. Reception The film generated mixed reviews, garnering 59% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Film critic Colm Keaveny proclaimed this film to be Danny Dyer's \\"finest hour\\", and Irish critic James Murphy called Dyer's performance \\"truly remarkable\\". The film garnered 11 international awards and was nominated for a BAFTA. Leonard Maltin gave the film two and a half stars, describing it as \\"a writer’s film if there ever was one\\". Soundtrack An important part of this film is the soundtrack; which includes some of the most famous contemporary dance music producers of the time. These include Armand Van Helden, CJ Bolland, Fatboy Slim, Jacknife Lee, Pete Heller, Ferry Corsten, Carl Cox, Dillinja, Felix Da Housecat, Orbital, Aphrodite, Death in Vegas, Primal Scream, Liquid Child, Underworld, The Age Of Love, Energy 52, Brainbug and Lucid. The incidental music and scratching from the scene 'Puffin' the Herb' was by Mad Doctor X American version The version of the film released in the United States was heavily edited to remove certain British cultural references and terminology that it was presumably felt American audiences would be unable to identify with or understand. These are mostly in the form of re-dubbed dialogue, such as Jip saying that he and Lulu \\"recently became dropping partners\\" being changed to \\"clubbing partners\\"; Nina's speech to the journalists in which she says she is looking forward to getting into some \\"hardcore Richard and Judy\\" becoming \\"hardcore Jerry Springer\\"; and Jip's allusion to Only Fools and Horses with \\"he who dares, Rodders,\\" being rendered as \\"he who dares wins\\". Other material was simply cut, including Lulu dumping her boyfriend; most of Koop's conversation with his father in the psychiatric hospital; and the 1991 \\"Summer of Love\\" flashback sequence. As a result of various cuts, the US version runs to 84m 14s, compared to the original 99m 21s, losing just over 15 minutes of footage, in addition to the numerous re- dubs. Certain scenes also feature different music from the original UK version. Human Traffic Remixed On 21 October 2002, distributors VCI announced the DVD release of Human Traffic Remixed, promising a \\"modernised\\" soundtrack with new contemporary (2002) tracks, previously cut scenes, and \\"state-of-the-art CGI effects.\\" On 18 October The Guardian revealed that rather than being a \\"director's cut\\", it was the work of producer Allan Niblo, Kerrigan's tutor and \\"mentor\\" at film school. Niblo removed from the titles all shots of the 1994 anti-Criminal Justice and Public Order Act demonstration and subsequent riot, thus eliminating the implicit political element of the original. He also cut the more anti-royalist second verse of the spoof national anthem, and all references to Moff, played by Dyer, being a casual drug dealer. Dyer went on to star in other Niblo produced films, notably The Football Factory. He added scenes about Jip's internal struggles over his mother's prostitution, and another where the female leads play aliens, creating a film slightly less concerned with the politics and active promulgation of the Class-A Ecstasy & MDMA drug culture endemic in the 1990s, and more about coming of age struggles informed by a passive participation in it. Kerrigan only learnt about the project two weeks before the release was due. He explained: \\"I joke about it. How I signed over the copyright (to Niblo) for a pound and then never even saw the pound. When I finished I was £25,000 in debt. I've never made a penny from the film. Legally I don't have a leg to stand on, but I signed the contract because I was very naive and very broke. Now I'm just broke.\\" No longer able to afford living in London, where he had moved after the film's release, Kerrigan was preparing to return to his native Cardiff. Although shot on a budget of £340,000 and UK box office taking of £2.5 million, Niblo maintained that the film had not made a profit, stating: \\"the investment is still unrecouped.\\" John Simm was highly critical of the new release, describing it as \\"cynical exploitation\\" and complained of Niblo's attempts to get him to appear in a sequel when he had only been paid a nominal fee for the first film. Simm said that he only appeared in Human Traffic because of Kerrigan's involvement. While the original 99m 21s cinema version runs to 95m 21s on video due to PAL speed-up, the Remixed version runs to 95m 30s See also *Loved Up (1995 film), a BBC TV drama exploring clubbing and drug culture *Go, a US film about rave culture released the same year *Groove (film), a US film about rave culture released a year later *Sorted (film), a UK film about trance culture released a year later References External links  Category:1999 films Category:1999 comedy films Category:British films Category:British comedy films Category:Cool Cymru Category:Films about drugs Category:Films set in Cardiff Category:Films set in Wales Category:Irish comedy films Category:Irish films Category:Vertigo Films films Category:Stoner films Category:Films scored by Matthew Herbert ","title":"Human Traffic"},{"id":"2610021","text":"Longitudinal data system is a data system capable of tracking student information over multiple years in multiple schools.

Drake, LLC, reportedly for a purchase price of approximately $6.5 million, however, the companies will operate as separate entities; Blonder Tongue in Old Bridge, New Jersey, and R.L. Drake in Miamisburg, Ohio. Amateur radio products Drake manufactured equipment for amateur radio operators and short wave listeners for more than three decades. =Long wave, medium wave, and high frequency (HF) equipment= The Drake 1A receiver was the company's first meant specifically for radio amateurs. Introduced in 1957, it was revolutionary in at least two ways. First, it was much smaller than most receivers of the time period. The design emphasized simplicity and ease of operation. Second, it was designed specifically for reception of the relatively new and increasingly popular single sideband (SSB) mode of voice transmission. In 1959 they followed the 1A with the 2A, a more traditional looking receiver that was a bit larger but still much more compact than its contemporaries. The 2A had more features, increased sensitivity and selectivity, and was introduced at the same price as the 1A. It was followed two years later by the 2B, very similar in appearance but with improved performance and a new set of controls for adjusting the selectivity (bandwidth) and center frequency.Drake 2B radio receiver circa 1960s Rather than produce a transmitter to match the 2B, Drake designed a new line of equipment beginning with an SSB transceiver, the TR-3, in 1963. Again emphasizing size efficiency, the TR-3 was designed as a complete SSB station in a small package. Other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) capable of extremely linear, stable tuning and a dial resolution of better than 1 kHz across all amateur HF (shortwave) bands. Its size was so small, in part, because the power supply was in a separate chassis, connected to the transceiver with a multi-conductor cable. The AC-3 power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet, later designated the MS-4. An optional remote VFO (PTO), the RV-3 could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation (i.e., transmitting on a frequency different from the receiving frequency). The RV-3 (and, later, the RV-4) also contained a speaker. Beginning with the TR-3, Drake adopted a scheme for illuminating tuning dials and panel meters on its equipment using small incandescent bulbs behind greenish-blue transparent plastic filters. This lighting color became one of the most recognizable and distinguishing features of Drake radios. Drake R-4B receiver, T-4XB transmitter, and L-4B linear amplifier The TR-3 was superseded by several versions of the TR-4, ending with the TR-4C and its variants in 1978. The TR-6, covering the 50 MHz (6-meter) amateur band, was also introduced in 1968 and was produced for about six years. Because of their small size, the Drake transceivers were widely used for mobile operation, along with the DC-3 or DC-4 power supplies. In 1965, Drake introduced the matching T-4X transmitter and R-4 receiver. The \\"4-Line\\" twins satisfied a desire for high performance, operational flexibility and a set of features not possible to squeeze into the TR-4's small size. The matching units used the same PTO technology as the TR-4, and were capable of transceive operation using either the receiver's or the transmitter's PTO to control the operating frequency. Drake introduced the T-4 \\"reciter\\" which was a transmitter add on for the R4 series receivers (it had no PTO of its own and used the PTO and other signals from the R4 receiver to generate the transmit signal), making them a two piece \\"transceiver\\", but it saw limited sales and is a rare item on the used ham gear lists these days. The 4-Line continued to be improved through ‘A’ and ‘B’ versions, and underwent a significant receiver redesign when the “C-Line” came out in 1973. The T-4XC transmitter and R-4C receiver employed a few more solid state devices but were still primarily vacuum tube designs.Drake R-4B receiver circa 1971 Along with transceivers and separates, the 4-Line included a set of matching accessories including the L-4 linear amplifier, C-4 control console, W-4 and WV-4 power meters, transmit and receive converters for the 50 MHz (6 meter) and 144 MHz (2 meter) bands, and antenna impedance matching networks (tuners), the MN-4 and MN-2000. Midway through the 4-Line's run, in 1967, Drake introduced a receiver and transmitter pair meant for the Novice licensee - the 2-C receiver and 2-NT transmitter. The 2-C was an improved receiver based on the 2-B design using a few more solid state devices. Thus, it was a sophisticated design compared to most other receivers targeting Novices. The 2-NT used a crystal oscillator to control its frequency, a requirement of the Novice license at that time (the restriction was later removed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)). For short wave listeners, Drake produced the SW-4 receiver in 1967 (and later the SW-4A), which matched the rest of the 4-Line in appearance, was based on the R-4 design, but greatly simplified to be easier for the casual listener to use. It was replaced in 1973 by the SPR-4, a receiver similar in appearance to the R-4C but, again, simplified for ease of use. Its biggest difference, however, was that it was Drake's first all solid state design. It covered a greater portion of the high frequency (HF) and medium wave spectrum than did the SW-4, by using a large set of selectable heterodyne oscillator crystals for selecting the tuning range, each covering a 500 kHz wide segment. The receiver came supplied with 10 crystals and a user could add up to 14 more. In 1978 Drake abandoned vacuum tubes (except for their use in power amplifiers) in favor of solid state designs and digital frequency synthesis. The new “7-Line” included the TR-7 transceiver, the R-7 receiver, and various accessories including two linear amplifiers, the L-7 and L-75. The TR-5, largely a solid state version of the TR-4, was built and briefly sold during the early 1980s. Because so few of them were made they have become comparatively scarce. Drake's final entry into the Amateur radio and Shortwave listening markets was the R-8 receiver in 1991 – a high performance digital design with advanced features specifically meant for shortwave broadcast listening. The receiver, which primarily covered medium and short wave bands, could be expanded to cover two VHF ranges with an optional, internal adapter. Further improvements led to R-8A and R-8B models before it was discontinued in 2005 after a long production run.Loughmiller, J., “A Family Affair, The R. L. Drake Story”, 2000WB4HFN Drake Pages, “Drake Serial Number Database” =Very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high frequency (UHF) equipment= In addition to the converters designed as part of Drake's 4-Line, they began designing and selling compact VHF and UHF transceivers in the early 1970s. Powered by 12V DC, they were primarily intended for mobile use. Drake marketed a series of VHF transceivers manufactured in Japan, under the Drake brand. The ML-2 “Marker Luxury” was a crystal controlled FM transceiver for the 2-meter (144 MHz) band. The TR-22, TR-22C, and TR-33 were very small 2-meter FM transceivers that were entirely self-contained, including a telescoping antenna and rechargeable battery. They each came with a microphone and carrying case with shoulder strap. These transceivers were manufactured by Trio-Kenwood in Japan and marketed worldwide as TR-2200 and TR-2300 under their manufacturer's own brands. Drake's UV-3 FM transceiver, manufactured in the US, covered the 144, 220, and 440 MHz bands. A different model was available for covering one, two, or three bands. A user could start with one or two and add more later by purchasing modular add-in boards. It was their first VHF/UHF transceiver to use frequency synthesis instead of crystals for establishing the operating frequency. It was a model ahead of its time and the later compact multiband Kenwood TM-x41/x42 series that was sold in the late 1980s to mid 1990s, which could handle three band modules; the modules produced covered the 10,6,2,220,440 and 1200 MHz FM amateur bands). The TR-72 was a crystal controlled 2-meter FM transceiver that bore a striking resemblance to TR-7200 transceivers from Trio-Kenwood (now Kenwood Corporation), indicating its manufacturing origin.R.

Background Desi Xpress was first launched in the Midlands region in England in September 2004 before becoming national in September 2005. The entertainment weekly catered predominantly to the British South-Asian community and its tabloid format aimed to appeal to readers between the ages of 16 and 35. In the UK, Asian music and television stars have begun to enjoy wider mainstream success. Desi Xpress claimed to provide a platform for these stars and a source for their readers to understand and follow the Asian entertainment scene. It also explored the wider Bollywood scene. Controversy * In June 2005, the Jewish community became upset following an interview conducted by the newspaper in which top Bollywood actress Rani Mukherjee was asked to name her idol. Mukherjee's response of \\"Adolf Hitler\\" angered religious leaders in India and brought criticism from director Alex Hayim. Desi Xpress spokesperson Zakia Yousaf defended the actress saying, \\"We do not believe the actress meant it in that she truly idolised him. We believe she is intrigued as to why he was the way he was.\\" * The publication again came under fire in December 2005 following remarks made by its weekly columnist Adam Yosef about same-sex civil partnerships which were set to become legal in Britain. Yosef wrote, \\"Hmmm... gay weddings... Gay people and commitment? I don't think so... They'll be shagg*ng the neighbours before they even cut the cake. Bad idea I'm afraid. Great way of evading tax though....\\". The remarks were attacked by gay human rights activist Peter Tatchell and his OutRage! organisation. * In January 2006, the newspaper published a column by Yosef which was seen as an attack on Mr Tatchell himself. The journalist was accused of \\"homophobia and xenophobia\\" after comparing activist Tatchell with Nick Griffin, leader of the British National Party (BNP) and Omar Bakri Mohammed, leader of Al-Muhajiroun. Stewart C. Dawson of lobby group Gay Action Media Watch launched an international campaign against Desi Xpress and Adam Yosef. The campaign was subsequently backed by Peter Tatchell, OutRage! and the Green Party of England and Wales. Following further criticism from gay media outlets and factions of the Labour Party, Desi Xpress and Yosef issued an apology. In May 2006, Peter Tatchell wrote a full page article for the newspaper. Suspension * In June 2006, Desi Xpress editor Reena Combo left the newspaper to \\"pursue other interests\\". * In August 2006, publication of the tabloid newspaper was temporarily suspended by Urban Media Ltd. It returned later that year as a pull-out supplement in The Asian Today with former sub-editor Zakia Yousaf as the new editor. Editorial Reena Combo was the editor of Desi Xpress. Zakia Yousaf was the sub-editor. Columnists and contributors included radio Club Asia DJ Missy D, Bollywood correspondent Viral Bhayani, Beautician Naveeda, socio-political observer Adam Yosef and regular columnists from the BBC Asian Network.

The recreation area is located at the end of State Route 401 (Rye Patch Road), which connects to Interstate 80/U.S. Route 95 about northeast of Lovelock. History The park is located in a part of Nevada that in prehistoric times was under Lake Lahontan. When the lake had receded lower than the present-day reservoir, by about 23,000 years ago, animals such as camels, horses, rabbits, and squirrels would drink from the river, and some of their fossils have been found about north of the dam. Archaeological evidence from Lovelock Cave and elsewhere shows that humans would camp along the Humboldt about 8,000 years ago. In the mid-19th century, particularly during the California Gold Rush, travelers along the Humboldt would graze their cattle on the wild ryegrass in the area near present-day Rye Patch Reservoir, which was known as Lassen Meadows. At Lassen Meadows the Applegate-Lassen Cut-Off of the California Trail, which provided a quicker route to Goose Lake in northeast California and the California gold fields, left the main route of that trail and headed toward the Black Rock Desert. The Rye Patch Dam was constructed between 1933 and 1936 by the Public Works Administration as a New Deal relief project during the Great Depression. In 1971 the reservoir was made a Nevada State Recreation Area. Activities and amenities Among the facilities the park offers are a campground, picnic areas, and a launch for boating. Visitors can fish for crappie, wipers, white bass, channel catfish, black bass, and walleye.

Life and career Riviera attended St Nicholas Grammar School in Northwood, London and was in school bands and local groups in north-west London in the 1960s, and became road manager of pub-rock act Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers in the early 1970s. Assuming the role of manager, he engineered a street-level marketing campaign on behalf of the hard-gigging group by working with the late graphic designer Barney Bubbles.Reasons To be Cheerful: The Life & Work Of Barney Bubbles, Paul Gorman, Adelita. In 1975, Riviera organised 'Naughty Rhythms', a package tour featuring Chilli Willi, Dr. Feelgood, and Kokomo. When pub-rock failed to make the leap out of smaller venues, Chilli Willi split and Riviera became tour manager for Dr Feelgood for the group's US dates in early 1976. Encountering independent local record labels, Riviera was inspired on his return to the UK to found Stiff (music business parlance for a flop) with Dave Robinson, then manager of Graham Parker & the Rumour in mid 1976. Riviera signed the Damned - whom he also managed - to Stiff in September 1976, ensuring that the group was the first punk act to release a record with their October 1976 single \\"New Rose\\". In November 1976, Riviera arranged for Stiff to follow that with the single release of the Blank Generation EP which contained the punk anthem of the same name by Richard Hell & The Voidoids. Riviera managed other early Stiff signings Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe, who was also in-house producer, and in 1977 recruited Bubbles to work with him on an impressive run of designs for record sleeves, posters, badges and advertising and promotional campaigns for Lowe, The Damned, Costello and such performers as Ian Dury, Wreckless Eric and the veteran music hall star Max Wall. In late 1977 Riviera left Stiff, taking with him clients Costello and Lowe to the newly launched label Radar Records, set up by former UA Records executives Martin Davies and Andrew Lauder. Costello and Lowe scored successes with such respective albums as This Year's Model and Jesus of Cool (released as Pure Pop For Now People in the US), before joining Riviera at his and Lauder's next label launch, F-Beat Records, in 1980. As at Radar, Bubbles was F-Beat's art-director. F-Beat also released new music by contemporary artists such as Lowe's wife Carlene Carter, Clive Langer & the Boxes and Blanket of Secrecy, while Riviera, Lauder and Costello pioneered appreciation of archive music by reissuing music by a range of artists on their Demon and Edsel imprints, including classic albums by Al Green, the Pretty Things and the Merseybeats. Riviera's management of British pop/rock group Squeeze resulted in Elvis Costello producing the 1981 album East Side Story, which featured the hit single \\"Tempted\\". F-Beat folded in the mid-1980s, by which time Demon had developed into a large specialist label with several offshoots. It was acquired by Crimson productions in 1998 and now lays claim to being Britain's biggest independent music group. Riviera worked with Costello until 1993. Nick Lowe is currently managed by 2 Jakes Management, which, despite the name, has nothing to do with Riviera.

Well-known species include the Atlantic spadefish (Chaetodipterus faber) and the reef-dwelling genus Platax, the batfishes, which are kept as aquarium fish. They are spade-shaped and laterally compressed, and have very symmetrical, triangular dorsal and anal fins. They are shiny silver with areas of yellow and vertical brown or black banding. The eyes are often located in one of the vertical bands as a method of camouflage. Scuba divers sometimes mistake them for angelfish, which are similar in shape, but not closely related. Other genera in the family are characterized by long, trailing, pointed dorsal and anal fins. Most species feed primarily on algae and small invertebrates. Some spadefishes are popular sport fishing catches. The Atlantic spadefish (Chaetodipterus faber), for example, is a black and white striped fish common just offshore in the southeastern United States and Caribbean. They are favorites because they put up a fight as they are reeled in. Spadefish are generally considered to be an overfished group. Most of the individuals caught are small, young, and not near the maximum size recorded for their species. The batfish Platax pinnatus may play the role of a critical functional group in the Great Barrier Reef by eating seaweed that other herbivorous fishes such as parrotfish and surgeonfish will not touch. Overgrowth of seaweed among corals occurs as a result of overfishing of large fish species and inhibits the ability of coral to support life.Batfish may come to the Great Barrier Reef's rescue Timeline ImageSize = width:1000px height:auto barincrement:15px PlotArea = left:10px bottom:50px top:10px right:10px Period = from:-65.5 till:10 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:-65.5 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:-65.5 TimeAxis = orientation:hor AlignBars = justify Colors = #legends id:CAR value:claret id:ANK value:rgb(0.4,0.3,0.196) id:HER value:teal id:HAD value:green id:OMN value:blue id:black value:black id:white value:white id:cenozoic value:rgb(0.54,0.54,0.258) id:paleogene value:rgb(0.99,0.6,0.32) id:paleocene value:rgb(0.99,0.65,0.37) id:eocene value:rgb(0.99,0.71,0.42) id:oligocene value:rgb(0.99,0.75,0.48) id:neogene value:rgb(0.999999,0.9,0.1) id:miocene value:rgb(0.999999,0.999999,0) id:pliocene value:rgb(0.97,0.98,0.68) id:quaternary value:rgb(0.98,0.98,0.5) id:pleistocene value:rgb(0.999999,0.95,0.68) id:holocene value:rgb(0.999,0.95,0.88) BarData= bar:eratop bar:space bar:periodtop bar:space bar:NAM1 bar:space bar:period bar:space bar:era PlotData= align:center textcolor:black fontsize:M mark:(line,black) width:25 shift:(7,-4) bar:periodtop from: -65.5 till: -55.8 color:paleocene text:Paleocene from: -55.8 till: -33.9 color:eocene text:Eocene from: -33.9 till: -23.03 color:oligocene text:Oligocene from: -23.03 till: -5.332 color:miocene text:Miocene from: -5.332 till: -2.588 color:pliocene text:Plio. from: -2.588 till: -0.0117 color:pleistocene text:Pleist. from: -0.0117 till: 0 color:holocene text:H. bar:eratop from: -65.5 till: -23.03 color:paleogene text:Paleogene from: -23.03 till: -2.588 color:neogene text:Neogene from: -2.588 till: 0 color:quaternary text:Q.

Early years Folger was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts, the son of Samuel Brown Folger (born October 21, 1795) and wife Nancy Hiller (born September 30, 1798). His father was a master blacksmith who had invested in a tryworks and bought two ships. They had nine children of which James was the second youngest. The Folger family roots can be traced back to England.Remarks on the Origin and Genealogy of the Franklin Family. On July 13, 1846, a fire broke out in Nantucket's business section and burned the works and ship and 11 year old James helped in the reconstruction.  San Francisco  After the discovery of gold in California, James (age 14), along with his brothers Henry (age 16) and Edward (age 20) set out in the autumn of 1849 on a ship bound for the Isthmus of Panama. After a raft and hiking journey across the Isthmus, the brothers waited at Panama City for quite a while before catching the Pacific mail steamer Isthmus on April 10, 1850. They entered the Golden Gate on May 5, 1850. James decided to stay in San Francisco instead of heading to the gold fields as a result of the high wages being offered. He helped reconstruct after one of San Francisco's many fires, similar to how he had in Nantucket. He helped build a spice-and-coffee mill for a man named William H. Bovee. In 1860, he founded the San Francisco coffee firm, known as the J. A. Folger Coffee Company, known today simply as Folgers Coffee. Death and legacy J. A. Folger married Eleanor Laughran (born October 17, 1837) and was the father of James Athearn Folger, Jr. (1864–1921), who married Clare Luning. James and Eleanor had three other children; John Athearn m. Nancy Try (née Slaughter), Ernest Randolph, and Elizabeth. He is the paternal grandfather of Peter Folger, and the great-grandfather of Abigail Folger. Abigail was murdered in 1969, by members of the Manson family, along with her friend, actress Sharon Tate among others. He is also the uncle of Henry Clay Folger, founder of the Folger Shakespeare Library. He died June 26, 1889 at the age of 54 and is buried in the Folger family plot at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.

Kishenchand had a crouched stance but was a good driver and hooker, and an occasional leg break bowler. While studying in the Model High School in Karachi, he was elected the best schoolboy cricketer in Sind for the year 1939/40. In that season he hit twelve hundreds with a highest score of 175 notout. He made his debut for Sind at the age of 15. In his first season in the Bombay Pentangular, he hit a brilliant 75 against the Parsis and a 175* against Muslims. He migrated to the Western India States in the early 1940s, and later played for Gujarat, and Baroda as well for Sind. In his second term with Sind, he captained the team in 1945/46. He scored 264 runs at 26.40 in his eight unofficial Tests with a highest score of 73. In the Pentangular matches, he scored 611 at an average of 101, with three hundreds. His career highest first class score of 218 in the Zonal Quadrangular in 1946/47 helped his selection to the tour of Sri Lanka, and Australia in 1947/48. He did not achieve much in the Test matches but it was off his bowling that Don Bradman completed his 100th first class century. When Bradman reached 99, in the match for an Australian XI against the Indians, the Indian captain Lala Amarnath brought Kishenchand on to bowl. It was his first try at bowling during the tour. After playing a few balls carefully, Bradman took a single past mid-on to reach his hundred. He scored a duck in each of the five Tests that he played. Kishenchand served the Maharaja of Baroda as a member of his staff, and later worked for Satyadev Chemicals in Baroda. He was a small man, standing only 5 feet and four inches. His death was due to a heart attack.

Berlin  Julius Klinger: 1908, Möhring candelabra factory In 1897 he relocated to Berlin, where he worked extensively as a commercial graphic artist until 1915. Together with the printing house Hollerbaum und Schmidt, he developed a new fashion of functional poster design that soon gained him international reputation. In 1912 he designed the poster for the Rund um Berlin air show in Johannisthal. In Berlin he also contributed to Das kleine Witzblatt, Lustige Blätter and Das Narrenschiff humorous magazines.  Advertising campaign for the \\"Tabu\\" company  Julius Klinger: firewall, ca.1920 Beginning in 1918, Klinger designed a comprehensive and noted campaign promoting the \\"Tabu\\" company's cigarette rolling paper, that was advertised all over Vienna in 1918/19. Klinger devised a promotional strategy, spanning from small-sized newspaper advertisements to billboards and painted firewalls – construction site fences and winterized fountain paneling were used as advertising space, too.Plakat: Julius Klinger: Tabu, 1919 , Austrian National Library, 2003  Nazi persecution  Julius Klinger, late 1937, Vienna Being of Jewish descent, he suffered from national socialist harassment.

The chain store game A monopolist (Player A) has branches in 20 towns. He faces 20 potential competitors, one in each town, who will be able to choose or . They do so in sequential order and one at a time. If a potential competitor chooses , he receives a payoff of 1, while A receives a payoff of 5. If he chooses , he will receive a payoff of either 2 or 0, depending on the response of Player A to his action. Player A, in response to a choice of , must choose one of two pricing strategies, or . If he chooses , both player A and the competitor receive a payoff of 2, and if A chooses , each player receives a payoff of 0. These outcomes lead to two theories for the game, the induction (game theoretically optimal version) and the deterrence theory (weakly dominated theory): =Induction theory= Consider the decision to be made by the 20th and final competitor, of whether to choose or . He knows that if he chooses , Player A receives a higher payoff from choosing cooperate than aggressive, and being the last period of the game, there are no longer any future competitors whom Player A needs to intimidate from the market. Knowing this, the 20th competitor enters the market, and Player A will cooperate (receiving a payoff of 2 instead of 0). The outcome in the final period is set in stone, so to speak. Now consider period 19, and the potential competitor's decision. He knows that A will cooperate in the next period, regardless of what happens in period 19. Thus, if player 19 enters, an aggressive strategy will be unable to deter player 20 from entering. Player 19 knows this and chooses . Player A chooses . Of course, this process of backward induction holds all the way back to the first competitor. Each potential competitor chooses , and Player A always cooperates. A receives a payoff of 40 (2×20) and each competitor receives 2. =Deterrence theory= This theory states that Player A will be able to get payoff of higher than 40. Suppose Player A finds the induction argument convincing. He will decide how many periods at the end to play such a strategy, say 3. In periods 1–17, he will decide to always be aggressive against the choice of IN. If all of the potential competitors know this, it is unlikely potential competitors 1–17 will bother the chain store, thus risking the safe payout of 1 (\\"A\\" will not retaliate if they choose \\"\\"). If a few do test the chain store early in the game, and see that they are greeted with the aggressive strategy, the rest of the competitors are likely not to test any further. Assuming all 17 are deterred, Player A receives 91 (17×5 + 2×3). Even if as many as 10 competitors enter and test Player A's will, Player A will still receive a payoff of 41 (10×0+ 7×5 + 3×2), which is better than the induction (game theoretically correct) payoff. =The chain store paradox= If Player A follows the game theory payoff matrix to achieve the optimal payoff, they will have a lower payoff than with the \\"deterrence\\" strategy. This creates an apparent game theory paradox: game theory states that induction strategy should be optimal, but it looks like \\"deterrence strategy\\" is optimal instead. The \\"deterrence strategy\\" is not a Subgame perfect equilibrium: It relies on the non-credible threat of responding to with . A rational player will not carry out a non-credible threat, but the paradox is that it nevertheless seems to benefit Player A to carry out the threat. =Selten's response= Reinhard Selten's response to this apparent paradox is to argue that the idea of \\"deterrence\\", while irrational by the standards of Game Theory, is in fact an acceptable idea by the rationality that individuals actually employ. Selten argues that individuals can make decisions of three levels: Routine, Imagination, and Reasoning. =Complete information?= Game theory is based on the idea that each matrix is modeled with the assumption of complete information: that \\"every player knows the payoffs and strategies available to other players,\\" where the word \\"payoff\\" is descriptive of behavior—what the player is trying to maximize. If, in the first town, the competitor enters and the monopolist is aggressive, the second competitor has observed that the monopolist is not, from the standpoint of common knowledge of payoffs and strategies, maximizing the assumed payoffs; expecting the monopolist to do so in this town seems dubious. If competitors place even a very small probability on the possibility that the monopolist is spiteful, and places intrinsic value on being (or appearing) aggressive, and the monopolist knows this, then even if the monopolist has payoffs as described above, responding to entry in an early town with aggression will be optimal if it increases the probability that later competitors place on the monopolist's being spiteful. Selten's levels of decision making =The routine level= The individuals use their past experience of the results of decisions to guide their response to choices in the present. \\"The underlying criteria of similarity between decision situations are crude and sometimes inadequate\\". (Selten) =The imagination level= The individual tries to visualize how the selection of different alternatives may influence the probable course of future events. This level employs the routine level within the procedural decisions. This method is similar to a computer simulation. =The reasoning level= The individual makes a conscious effort to analyze the situation in a rational way, using both past experience and logical thinking. This mode of decision uses simplified models whose assumptions are products of imagination, and is the only method of reasoning permitted and expected by game theory. Decision-making process =The predecision= One chooses which method (routine, imagination or reasoning) to use for the problem, and this decision itself is made on the routine level. =The final decision= Depending on which level is selected, the individual begins the decision procedure. The individual then arrives at a (possibly different) decision for each level available (if we have chosen imagination, we would arrive at a routine decision and possible and imagination decision). Selten argues that individuals can always reach a routine decision, but perhaps not the higher levels. Once the individuals have all their levels of decision, they can decide which answer to use...the Final Decision. The final decision is made on the routine level and governs actual behavior.

Foundation of the Group The group claims Kanichi Otsuka (大塚 寛一 Ōtsuka Kan'ichi) as its founder, but his wife Kunie Miyashitain also had a role in the development of the group. Kanichi Otsuka claimed to be a child prodigy and took the religious name \\"Kyososama\\" (\\"revered founder\\"). Shinreikyo believes \\"Kyososama is God made flesh.\\" The group began in Nishinomiya, but by 1953 a site on a hill in the Akasaka district of Minato, Tokyo would become Shinreikyo headquarters. Shrinreikyo is a Japanese religion, which was originally created in 1939 but was recognized only in June of 1948 within the education system. The group is headquartered in Nishinomiya however, the religious group has churches in Tokyo, Wakayama, Kyoto, Osaka, Kanazawa and in 1977 had a place in Honshu as well. The founder of the group is Master Kanichi Otsuka. Master Kanichi Otsuka is seen as a wise leader who is looked to when there is a loss of power regarding religious teachings. He was born on the island of Shikoku in 1885. It has been thought that his place of upbringing has made a significant impact on his religious teachings due to the purity of nature in his surroundings. The island on which Otsuka was brought up was always said to pertain to a \\"sacred atmosphere\\" as it is attributed to the birth of the Buddhist saint Kobo Daishi. It appeared as though Otsuka carried these divine spirits along with him as he traveled at the age of 16 to search for what he called the \\"hidden secrets of nature\\" and again went on a spiritual search at the age of 21 through Korea, China, and Mongolia. Also, not only did he begin his spiritual search at such an early age but at the age of 16, he was also said to have been able to predict the future of relatives and friends. According to his wife, Otsuka was believed to possess a special insight into the divine world of nature and in an interview regarding her husband she compared his insight to an electrical generator able to tap into energies and distribute it to people. Master Otsuka's goal was to unite this religion with Christian and Buddhist beliefs because Christ appeared in the West and Buddha appeared in the East, thus he sees Shinreikyo being the religion of the \\"center\\". This notion of \\"the center\\" has to do with the cosmic forces illustrated in the religion. Beliefs Like many Japanese new religions the group is syncretistic. The primary connections are likely Buddhism and Taoism. The idea of \\"Kyososoma\\" as God made flesh has precedents in various pagan religions, as well as later in Christianity. The sect is dualistic in that it believes in a material and spiritual division, but apparently it values both. The group strongly believes in miracles. They also believe the deceased faithful go to heaven through Sublime Transmigration, leaving bodies without rigor mortis or putrefaction. Also that miracles can occur to animals, plants, and even inanimate objects. That in fact the world is full of miracles. Shinreikyo can be translated as \\"teachings of the spirit\\" and the symbol \\"shin\\" refers to either the heart of our \\"center\\". Therefore, this religious movement is a belief in the metaphysic. Shinreikyo follows the fundamental law of the universe, which is the existence of the truth and proof of this truth is illustrated through miracles. It is believed that the if one follows this law of the universe everything will go according to plan for one's health and happiness, however, if one goes against this law it will bring illness, misfortune, etc. Moreover, it is believed that master Otsuka of the Shinreikyo movement was able to heal individuals through his presence. He was able to heal people with diseases ranging from infantile paralysis, asthma, tuberculosis, and even cancer. In fact, a famous feature of Shinreikyo is that nearly all of those that follow the religion have experienced some sort of inexplicable miracle. The four main categories include: 1) healing from serious ill-health 2) increased brain development and expansion of the skull 3) Transmigration after death 4) Miracles of natural birth Practices in Shrinreikyo Many practices take place within the Shinreikyo movement. A big practice done by Master Otsuka has to do with the spreading of “sacred salt” over ritual centers. The spreading of this salt is meant to heal sickness but also accelerate the growth of crops and effectively eliminate insects and pests from farming grounds. Another ritual done by Master Otsuka in the Skinreikyo movement includes cleansing oneself before prayer sessions or before entering a room. This is done by placing one’s hands together and starting from the top of your head moving them slowly down to the middle of your stomach while vibrating one’s hands and saying “BU-KAN-SEI-KI”. This phrase is a set of symbols that have no meaning but simply allow the individual to be present at the moment. This allows one to start from a blank slate and has been said to create changes in character over time.

Many of the younger people do not speak the Korup dialect, although they do identify themselves as of the Korup tribe. The relationship of Korup villages with the other ethnic groups in the region (i.e. Oroko, Ejagham) is nowadays amiable, and there are often intercultural marriages, especially with the much larger Oroko ethnic group.

Background Karbaschi was trained as a cleric in the holy city of Qom and spent time in Evin prison for his political activities before the Islamic Revolution.The Case of the Tehran Mayor: Reform on Trial The New York Times Karbaschi was a driving force for many new modernization efforts. As the Mayor of Tehran he was known for having bulldozed apartment buildings and office buildings built without city approval, removed revolutionary graffiti from walls, planted thousands of trees, banned much of the private traffic in central Tehran and opened more than a hundred parks. Karbaschi also angered bazaar merchants by raising taxes and contributing to the city's soaring real estate prices, earning him the reputation during his time as mayor of \\"the most loved and hated man in Tehran.\\" He started the first Iranian full colour newspaper, Hamshahri when he was the mayor of Tehran. Karbaschi was one of the key supporters of President Mohammad Khatami's first presidential election campaign which led to Khatami's landslide victory (1997). After Khatami's victory, a power struggle started within the political establishment of Iran between the reformists and conservatives of the Iranian government. Karbaschi's arrest in April 1998 prompted thousands of student demonstrators to clash with riot police, and the Interior Minister (who was later arrested for sacrilege) to complain that he had not been informed of the arrest despite the fact that Karbaschi was a member of the president's cabinet in addition to being mayor of Iran's capital and largest city.The World: The Mayor and the Mullahs; The Mouths That Roared in Iran.

The trial was often \\"a heated debate — at times a shouting match\\" — between judge Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejehei and Karbaschi, who holds the same clerical rank as Ejei.

Located within the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester on the River Weaver, it is near the Trent and Mersey Canal at approximately 53˚ 16′ N, 2˚ 36′ W. It has a population of 602,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Vale Royal Retrieved 2009-12-10 increasing to 631 at the 2011 Census. Acton Bridge is served by its own railway station, operated by London Northwestern. Acton Bridge Parish Council meets in the Parish Rooms. There is an active Community Association, and a number of other organisations exist within the village. History This section is adapted (with permission) from Snapshots in Time, a book about the village published by the Acton Bridge WI to mark the Millennium in 2000. Acton Bridge is a small village of 265 households and about 600 inhabitants, situated four miles west of Northwich in Cheshire, on the south bank of the River Weaver. It is on the West Coast Main Line railway. The A49 trunk road crosses the River Weaver by the Acton swing bridge () to the northern boundary of the village. Once famous for its pear orchards and dairy farms, it is now a pleasant dormitory village with easy access to the motorway network. The earliest evidence of human presence in the area is by the discovery of a Langdale axe dating from the Iron Age. It was found near Acton Brook, about 70 metres from Acton Bridge station and 300 metres from Onston. Archaeological remains of an ancient fortification have also been found in that area, on the bluff above Acton Brook. The village was called Acton in Delamere until recent times, when it was a changed to Acton Bridge to avoid confusion with Acton near Nantwich. The old spelling is Actune; Ac (Saxon) meaning \\"oak\\", and tune or tun meaning \\"farm or place\\" – so the name meant \\"Oak Farm\\" or \\"a place in the oak forest\\". In George Ormerod's History of Cheshire, Acton in Delamere is mentioned with Milton as being part of \\"Wiverham fee\\" or parish at the time of Domesday Book (1086). In the Middle Ages, Weaverham included six entire townships, Weaverham, Acton, Crowton, Cuddington, Onston and Wallescote and also parts of Norley and Hartford. This parish was in the Eddisbury Hundred. The poetic description by Ormerod is: \\"The scenery of this district consists principally of fine meadow ground sloping to the banks of the Weever and not destitute of pleasing undulations of surface or fine timber which here receiving protection from the sea breezes begins to attain its wonted luzuriancy\\". Ormerod also tells us that \\"deer ranged from the forest to the bank of the Weever through these townships\\". At different times the Lords of Hellesby, the Abbots of Vale Royal, the Actons, the Duttons, the Gerrards and the Fleetwoods held Acton. In 1253 the tenure of Acton is recorded in the Red Book of the Exchequer as having the Lords of Hellesby as paramount Lords. In the reign of Edward I, Alan de Acton did homage at Vale Royal for the lands at Acton. Also around this time William de Acton and Hugh de Acton \\"entered into recognizances with Richard de Mascy and other Lords of Legh or Leigh near Acton, to settle boundaries of the townships of Legh and Acton by perambulation\\". In Edward II's reign a suit was brought by the widow of Walter de Acton against Robert de Mullington and John fitz Gilbert and other for disseizing her of her lands in Acton. John fitz Gilbert pleaded that the tenements consisted of wood and moor. In the year 1284 the Abbot of Vale Royal complained that Sir Hugh Dutton rendered his fisheries in the Weaver useless by erecting a mill and digging a pool. In 1308 Sir Peter Dutton offended having raised a fishery in the Weaver to the King's damage (Vale Royal Ledger Book). In 1356 Adam de Acton fought at the Battle of Poitiers with the Black Prince, and in 1408 John de Acton was appointed Governor and Admiral of the Fleet. In the reign of Henry VIII Sir Peter Dutton held the Manor of Acton from the King as of his manor of Weaverham by military service. At this time Omerod writes that the tithes of geese, pigs, hemp and flax in Acton are paid to the Lord of Dutton. During the Civil War in 1644 Sir Thomas Aston exercised \\"all manor of outrages and intollerable taxes. They plundered Weaverham and the country about, carried off old men out of their houses, bound them together, tyde them to a cart and rove them through mire and water to that dungeon, where they lie without fire or light and now through extremities are so diseased, they are ready to give up the ghost\\". The ancient inheritance of the Duttons was passed by marriage to the Gerrards and the Fleetwoods. It was sold to a Mr Scarfe or Scrasse from whom it was purchased by Richard Ashton Esq. In 1640 the land was sold, and became part of the Milner estate until 1918, when these properties were sold to individual householders.

Home to Concord College, it is also famous for an early meeting of Parliament where the Statute merchant was passed in 1283. The population at the 2011 census was 544. The village today has a post office and Anglican parish church, as well as a Roman Catholic cemetery. History Running to the north-west of the village is a Roman road, that ran between the modern day settlements of Wroxeter and Leintwardine. The etymology of Acton Burnell is Old English āc (oak) and tūn (farm, estate), joined with the family name Burnell (thus meaning the part of Acton held by the Burnell family).The Cambridge Dictionary of English Placenames, ed. by Victor Watts (Cambridge University Press, 2004). It was the birthplace of Robert Burnell, a thirteenth century prelate, politician and regent under Edward I. Attractions There are the remains of Acton Burnell Castle – not truly a castle but a fortified manor house — created by Robert Burnell and dating to the 13th century. Robert Burnell was the Bishop of Bath and Wells and Lord Chancellor to King Edward I. His family name was added to the placename Acton to give the village's name. The entire village is designated as a conservation area.Shropshire Council Acton Burnell conservation area map Acton Burnell Hall is now inhabited by Concord College, an international college, in the grounds of which stand the remaining walls (gable ends) of the 'Parliament Barn' where the first English Parliament at which the Commons were adequately represented met in 1283. Previously Parliament had met at Shrewsbury. Approximately to the south of the village is Langley Chapel. St Mary's Church Elizabethan tomb of Sir Richard Lee (died 1591) and his wife in St Mary's Church, ancestors of Robert E. Lee. Acton Burnell's parish church — St Mary's — was also built by Robert Burnell and dates from circa 1260, though additions were made to it during the 16th century. The church is situated approximately 50 yards from the Castle. Nearby villages Nearby villages include Frodesley and Pitchford.

The series depicts the simple, everyday life of Momoko Sakura, a young girl everyone calls Maruko, and her family in suburban Japan in the year 1974. Maruko is a troublemaker, and every episode recounts Maruko’s trouble and how she and her friends succeed in solving the situation. The series is set in the former of Irie District (入江町), Shimizu, now part of Shizuoka City, birthplace of its author. The first story under the title \\"Chibi Maruko-chan\\" was published in the August 1986 edition of the shōjo manga magazine Ribon. Other semi- autobiographical stories by the author had appeared in Ribon and Ribon Original in 1984 and 1985, and were included in the first \\"Chibi Maruko-chan\\" tankōbon in 1987. The author first began writing and submitting strips in her final year of senior high school, although Shueisha (the publisher of Ribon and Ribon Original) did not decide to run them until over a year later. The author's intent was to write \\"essays in manga form\\";\\"夢の音色\\" Chibi Maruko-chan, January 18, 1989, volume 4, page 135. many stories are inspired by incidents from her own life, and some characters are based on her family and friends. The nostalgic, honest and thoughtful tone of the strip led to its becoming popular among a wider audience. Chibi Maruko-chan was adapted into an anime television series by Nippon Animation, which originally aired on Fuji Television and affiliated tv stations from January 7, 1990 to September 27, 1992. It has also spawned numerous games, animated films and merchandising, as well as a second TV series running from 1995 to the present. Maruko's style and themes are sometimes compared to the classic comic Sazae-san. In 1989, the manga tied to receive the Kodansha Manga Award for shōjo. As of 2006, the collected volumes of the manga had sold more than 31 million copies in Japan, making it the fifth best-selling shōjo manga ever. On April 25, 2020, it was announced that the second series would be suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-04-26/chibi-maruko-chan- anime-delays-new-episodes-due-to-covid-19/.159006 On June 14, 2020, it was announced that it would resume on June 21, 2020.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-06-13/chibi-maruko-chan-anime- resumes-new-episodes-after-covid-19-delay/.160610 Themes The trademark face fault of this series, in reaction to an awkward \\"don't know what to say\\" situation (or sometimes, embarrassment) is the sudden appearance of on a character's face, sometimes with an unexplained gust of wind blowing above that character's head.

A square-headed parody version of manga Chibi Maruko-chan titled was published on Shueisha's Grand Jump magazine from October 19, 2016. =Anime= First series Chibi Maruko- chan originally aired on Fuji Television and affiliated tv stations. 142 episodes were broadcast, from January 1990 to September 1992. Maruko was voiced by Tarako; other voice actors included Kappei Yamaguchi and Hideki Saijo. Original manga author Momoko Sakura wrote the teleplay for most episodes. The first series was directed by Yumiko Suda, animated by Masaaki Yuasa (who later directed Mind Game in 2004), while the music was composed by Nobuyuki Nakamura. The series attained a TV viewer rating of 39.9% on October 28, 1990, the highest rating ever attained by an animated TV series in Japan. The outro song Odoru Ponpokorin became a hit and was interpreted by several artists including the KinKi Kids and Captain Jack. The series was exported throughout Asia and was especially popular in Taiwan. In addition, 65 episodes were dubbed into Arabic (called Maruko Assagheera, which means Little Maruko), where it garnered attention from people of all ages. It also aired in Germany with the same title as the original and was broadcast by RTL II, Super RTL and Jetix. It aired weekdays on Nick India in India.Nick India-Chibi Maruko Chan Accessed May 25, 2009 Opening theme: #Yume Ippai (ゆめいっぱい \\"Full of Dreams\\") by Yumiko Seki (eps. 1-142) Ending themes: #Odoru Pompokolin (おどるポンポコリン) by B.B.Queens (eps. 1-66) #Hashire Shoujiki-mono (走れ正直者 \\"Run, Honest Person\\") by Hideki Saijo (eps. 67-142) Second series A second series debuted on Fuji Television and affiliated tv stations in January 1995, airing on Sundays in the 6:00 pm time slot, before Sazae-san at 6:30 pm. The series is directed by Jun Takagi and Nobuyuki Nakamura, like the first series, composes the music. Majority of the voice actors from the first series reprised their role. The first 219 episodes were written by Momoko Sakura, however, she had supervised the episode screenplays from episode 220 up until her death in 2018. In Spain, the show is available via VOD on the website of Neox's children's block, Neox Kidz. On TV Japan, which is available in the United States and Canada, the second series (starting with the episodes broadcast in 2009) now broadcasts weekly in Japanese. In Latin America, is distributed by The Japan Foundation, the dub was produced in Mexico and broadcast on several local, public and other private television networks.

It is so called because the antenna feed is offset to the side of the reflector, in contrast to the common \\"front- feed\\" parabolic antenna where the feed antenna is suspended in front of the dish, on its axis. As in a front-fed parabolic dish, the feed is located at the focal point of the reflector, but the reflector is an asymmetric segment of a paraboloid, so the focus is located to the side. The purpose of this design is to move the feed antenna and its supports out of the path of the incoming radio waves. In an ordinary front-fed dish antenna, the feed structure and its supports are located in the path of the incoming beam of radio waves, partially obstructing them, casting a \\"shadow\\" on the dish, reducing the radio power received. In technical terms this reduces the aperture efficiency of the antenna, reducing its gain. In the offset design, the feed is positioned outside the area of the beam, usually below it on a boom sticking out from the bottom edge of the dish. The beam axis of the antenna, the axis of the incoming or outgoing radio waves, is skewed at an angle to the plane of the dish mouth. The design is most widely used for small parabolic antennas or \\"mini-dishes\\", such as common home satellite television dishes, where the feed structure is large enough in relation to the dish to block a significant proportion of the signal. Another application is on satellites, particularly the direct broadcast satellites which use parabolic dishes to beam television signals to homes on Earth. Because of the limited transmitter power provided by their solar cells, satellite antennas must function as efficiently as possible. The offset design is also widely used in radar antennas. These must collect as much signal as possible in order to detect faint return signals from faraway targets. Offset dish antennas are more difficult to design than front-fed antennas because the dish is an asymmetric segment of a paraboloid with different curvatures in the two axes. Before the 1970s offset designs were mostly limited to radar antennas, which required asymmetric reflectors anyway to create shaped beams. The advent in the 1970s of computer design tools which could easily calculate the radiation pattern of offset dishes has removed this limitation, and efficient offset designs are being used more and more widely in recent years.

Etymology The name Hikkaduwa is thought to have been derived from the two words Sip Kaduwa, with Sip (සිප්) being the shorter version of Shilpaya which refers to knowledge in Sinhalese and Kaduwa(කඩුව) which means sword. It is believed therefore that the name Hikkaduwa means sword of knowledge. Alternatively it means coral or seashell jungle. Transport Hikkaduwa is located on the Coastal or Southern Rail Line (connecting Colombo through to Matara). It is also located on the A2 highway, connecting Colombo to Wellawaya, which runs mostly parallel to the shore, through the town. Economy Hikkaduwa's economy was traditionally based on fishing and coconut cultivation. This was replaced by tourism when its golden sandy beaches were discovered. It is a well-known international destination for board-surfing. The town was featured in an episode of Anthony Bourdain's television show No Reservations. Hikkaduwa was affected by the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake along with nearby villages Telwatta, Paraliya (site of the Queen of the Sea rail disaster), Dodanduwa, Kahawa and Rathgama. In the aftermath of the tsunami, many of the families who had lost everything were given sewing machines as part of the relief operations. As a result, the town has a multitude of tailors who will custom make shirts, trousers, and shorts.

It describes either of two situations: where a weak executive branch of a government enacts something previously approved of by the legislative branch or where the legislative branch concurs and approves something previously enacted by a strong executive branch. General The concept serves to moderate the power of one branch of government by requiring the concurrence of another branch for selected actions. The expression is frequently used in weak executive systems where the head of state has little practical power, and in practice the important part of the passage of a law is in its adoption by the legislature. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, a constitutional monarchy, bills are headed: > BE IT ENACTED by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice > and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this > present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: This enacting formula emphasizes that although legally the bill is being enacted by the British monarchy (specifically, by the Queen-in-Parliament), it is not through her initiative but through that of Parliament that legislation is created. United States In the United States, \\"advice and consent\\" is a power of the United States Senate to be consulted on and approve treaties signed and appointments made by the president of the United States to public positions, including Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, United States attorneys, ambassadors, and other smaller offices. This power is also held by several state senates, which are consulted on and approve various appointments made by the state's chief executive, such as some statewide officials, state departmental heads in the governor's cabinet, and state judges (in some states). = Constitutional provision = The term \\"advice and consent\\" first appears in the United States Constitution in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, referring to the senate's role in the signing and ratification of treaties. This term is then used again, to describe the Senate's role in the appointment of public officials, immediately after describing the president's duty to nominate officials. Article II, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the United States Constitution states: This language was written at the Constitutional Convention as part of a delicate compromise concerning the balance of power in the federal government. Many delegates preferred to develop a strong executive control vested in the president, but others, worried about authoritarian control, preferred to strengthen the Congress. Requiring the president to gain the advice and consent of the Senate achieved both goals without hindering the business of government. Under the Twenty-fifth Amendment, appointments to the office of vice president are confirmed by a majority vote in both houses of Congress, instead of just the Senate. = Historical development of power = While several framers of the U.S. Constitution, such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, believed that the required role of the Senate is to advise the president after the nomination has been made by the president,Currie, David. The Constitution in Congress: The Federalist Period, 1789–1801, page 25 (University of Chicago Press 1997) via Google Books: \\"Madison, Jefferson, and Jay all advised Washington not to consult the Senate before making nominations.\\"Hamilton, Alexander. Federalist No. 76 (1788): “In the act of nomination, his judgment alone will be exercised.” Roger Sherman believed that advice before nomination could still be helpful.Letter from Roger Sherman to John Adams (July 1789) in The Founders Constitution: \\"their advice may enable him to make such judicious appointments.\\" President George Washington took the position that pre-nomination advice was allowable but not mandatory.U.S. Senate history on the power to advise and consent: \\"In selecting nominees, Washington turned to his closest advisers and to members of Congress, but the president resolutely insisted that he alone would be responsible for the final selection. He shared a common view that the Senate's constitutionally mandated 'advice' was to come after the nomination was made.\\" The notion that pre- nomination advice is optional has developed into the unification of the \\"advice\\" portion of the power with the \\"consent\\" portion, although several Presidents have consulted informally with Senators over nominations and treaties. = Use today = Typically, a congressional hearing is held to question an appointee prior to a committee vote. If the nominee is approved by the relevant committee, the nomination is sent to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. The actual motion adopted by the Senate when exercising the power is \\"to advise and consent\\".U.S. Senate Rule 30 : \\"On the final question to advise and consent to the ratification in the form agreed to, the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senators present shall be necessary to determine it in the affirmative.\\"U.S. Senate Rule 31 : \\"the final question on every nomination shall be, 'Will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?'\\" For appointments, a majority of Senators present are needed to pass a motion \\"to advise and consent\\". A filibuster requiring a three-fifths vote to override, as well as other similar delaying tactics, have been used to require higher vote tallies in the past. On November 21, 2013, the Democratic Party, led by then-majority leader Harry Reid, overrode the filibuster of a nomination with a simple majority vote to change the rules. As a result, for instance, judicial nominees to federal courts and a president's executive- branch nominations can be freed up for a confirmation vote by a simple majority vote of the Senate. However, he left the filibuster in place for Supreme Court nominees. In April 2017, the Republican Party, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, did the same for Supreme Court nominations, allowing Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch on the bench, despite what might have otherwise been a successful Democratic filibuster. Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination was controversial because of late allegations against him about instances of sexual assault in high school. Kavanaugh accused Democrats of opposing his nomination by replacing \\"advice and consent\\" with \\"search and destroy\\".

Although Australia was remote from the main battlefronts, there was considerable Axis naval activity in Australian waters during the Second World War. A total of 54 German and Japanese warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best- known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. In addition, many Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled several Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities. The Axis threat to Australia developed gradually and until 1942 was limited to sporadic attacks by German armed merchantmen. The level of Axis naval activity peaked in the first half of 1942 when Japanese submarines conducted anti-shipping patrols off Australia's coast, and Japanese naval aviation attacked several towns in northern Australia. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia was renewed in the first half of 1943 but was broken off as the Allies pushed the Japanese onto the defensive. Few Axis naval vessels operated in Australian waters in 1944 and 1945, and those that did had only a limited impact. Due to the episodic nature of the Axis attacks and the relatively small number of ships and submarines committed, Germany and Japan were not successful in disrupting Australian shipping. While the Allies were forced to deploy substantial assets to defend shipping in Australian waters, this did not have a significant impact on the Australian war effort or American-led operations in the South West Pacific Area. Australia Station and Australian defences Bathurst-class corvette. This class of ship was commonly used to escort convoys in Australian waters. The definition of \\"Australian waters\\" used throughout this article is, broadly speaking, the area which was designated the Australia Station prior to the outbreak of war. This vast area consisted of the waters around Australia and eastern New Guinea, and stretching south to Antarctica. From east to west, it stretched from 170° east in the Pacific Ocean to 80° east in the Indian Ocean, and from north to south it stretched from the Equator to the Antarctic.G. Herman Gill (1957). Australia in the War of 1939–1945. Series 2 – Navy. Volume I – Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942. Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Pages 52–53. While the eastern half of New Guinea was an Australian colonial possession during the Second World War and fell within the Australia Station, the Japanese operations in these waters formed part of the New Guinea and Solomon Islands Campaigns and were not directed at Australia. Two merchant navy seamen standing in front of a gun fitted to their ship The defence of the Australia Station was the Royal Australian Navy's main concern throughout the war.Gill (1957). Page 51. While RAN ships frequently served outside Australian waters, escort vessels and minesweepers were available to protect shipping in the Australia Station at all times. These escorts were supported by a small number of larger warships, such as cruisers and armed merchant cruisers, for protection against surface raiders.Alastair Cooper (2001). Raiders and the Defence of Trade: The Royal Australian Navy in 1941. Paper delivered to the Australian War Memorial conference Remembering 1941. While important military shipping movements were escorted from the start of the war, convoys were not instituted in Australian waters until June 1942. The Australian naval authorities did, however, close ports to shipping at various times following real or suspected sightings of enemy warships or mines prior to June 1942. A troop convoy escorted by a RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was also responsible for the protection of shipping within the Australia Station.Douglas Gillison (1962) Australia in the War of 1939–1945. Series 3 – Air. Volume I – Royal Australian Air Force, 1939–1942. Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Pages 93–94. Throughout the war, RAAF aircraft escorted convoys and conducted reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols from bases around Australia. The main types of aircraft used for maritime patrol were Avro Ansons, Bristol Beauforts, Consolidated PBY Catalinas and Lockheed Hudsons. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, RAAF fighter squadrons were also stationed to protect key Australian ports and escorted shipping in areas where air attack was feared. The Allied naval forces assigned to the Australia Station were considerably increased following Japan's entry into the war and the beginning of the United States military build-up in Australia. These naval forces were supported by a large increase in the RAAF's maritime patrol force and the arrival of United States Navy patrol aircraft. Following the initial Japanese submarine attacks, a convoy system was instituted between Australian ports, and by the end of the war the RAAF and RAN had escorted over 1,100 convoys along the Australian coastline. As the battlefront moved to the north and attacks in Australian waters became less frequent, the number of ships and aircraft assigned to shipping protection duties within the Australia Station was considerably reduced.George Odgers (1968) Australia in the War of 1939–1945. Series 3 – Air. Volume II – Air War Against Japan, 1943–1945. Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Page 349. Drummond Battery coastal defence gun emplacement near Port Kembla in 1944 In addition to the air and naval forces assigned to protect shipping in Australian waters, fixed defences were constructed to protect the major Australian ports. The Australian Army was responsible for developing and manning coastal defences to protect ports from attacks by enemy surface raiders. These defences commonly consisted of a number of fixed guns defended by anti-aircraft guns and infantry.Albert Palazzo (2001). The Australian Army : A History of its Organisation 1901–2001. Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 2001. Page 136. The Army's coastal defences were considerably expanded as the threat to Australia increased between 1940 and 1942, and reached their peak strength in 1944.Palazzo (2001). Pages 155–157. The Royal Australian Navy was responsible for developing and manning harbour defences in Australia's main ports.

Seapower Centre – Australia, Canberra. Pages 95–97. These defences consisted of fixed anti-submarine booms and mines supported by small patrol craft, and were also greatly expanded as the threat to Australia increased.Stevens (2005). Page 173. The RAN also laid defensive minefields in Australian waters from August 1941.Gill (1957). Page 420. While the naval and air forces available for the protection of shipping in Australian waters were never adequate to defeat a heavy or coordinated attack, they proved sufficient to mount defensive patrols against the sporadic and generally cautious attacks mounted by the Axis navies during the war.Stevens (2005). Pages 330–332. 1939–1941 =German surface raiders in 1940= The Italian liner Romolo being scuttled following her interception by . While German surface raiders operated in the western Indian Ocean in 1939 and early 1940, they did not enter Australian waters until the second half of 1940. The first Axis ships in Australian waters were the unarmed Italian ocean liners Remo and Romolo, which were in Australian waters when Fascist Italy entered the war on 11 June 1940, Eastern Australian Time. While Remo was docked at Fremantle and was easily captured, Romolo proved harder to catch, as she had left Brisbane on 5 June bound for Italy. Following an air and sea search, Romolo was intercepted by near Nauru on 12 June and was scuttled by her captain to avoid capture.Gill (1957). Pages 118–124. The German surface raider was the first Axis warship to operate in Australian waters during World War II. After operating off the northern tip of New Zealand and the South Pacific, Orion entered Australian waters in the Coral Sea in August 1940 and closed to within north-east of Brisbane on 11 August.Gill (1957). Page 261. Following this, Orion headed east and operated off New Caledonia before proceeding south into the Tasman Sea, sinking the merchant ship Notou south-west of Noumea on 16 August and the British merchant ship Turakina in the Tasman Sea four days later. Orion sailed south-west after sinking Turakina, passing south of Tasmania, and operated without success in the Great Australian Bight in early September. While Orion laid four dummy mines off Albany, Western Australia on 2 September, she departed to the south-west after being spotted by an Australian aircraft the next day. After unsuccessfully patrolling in the Southern Ocean, Orion sailed for the Marshall Islands to refuel, arriving there on 10 October.Gill (1957). Page 262. German attacks in Western Pacific, December 1940 to January 1941. was the next raider to enter Australian waters. Pinguin entered the Indian Ocean from the South Atlantic in August 1940 and arrived off Western Australia in October. Pinguin captured the Norwegian tanker StorstadWarsailors.com: M/T Storstad off North West Cape on 7 October and proceeded east with the captured ship. Pinguin laid mines between Sydney and Newcastle on 28 October, and Storstad laid mines off the Victorian coast on the nights of 29–31 October. Pinguin also laid further mines off Adelaide in early November. The two ships then sailed west for the Indian Ocean. Pinguin and Storstad were not detected during their operations off Australia's eastern and southern coasts, and succeeded in sinking three ships. Mines laid by Storstad sank two ships (Cambridge and City of Rayville) off Wilsons Promontory in early November, and the mines laid off Sydney by Pinguin sank one ship (Nimbin) and a further merchant ship (Herford) was damaged after striking a mine off Adelaide. Pinguin added to her tally of successes in Australian waters by sinking three merchant ships in the Indian Ocean during November.Gill (1957). Pages 270–276. On 7 December 1940, the German raiders Orion and arrived off the Australian protectorate of Nauru. During the next 48 hours, the two ships sank four merchant ships off the undefended island.Gill (1957). Pages 276–279. Heavily loaded with survivors from their victims, the raiders departed for Emirau Island where they unloaded their prisoners. After an unsuccessful attempt to lay mines off Rabaul on 24 December, Komet made a second attack on Nauru on 27 December and shelled the island's phosphate plant and dock facilities.Gill (1957). Page 281. This attack was the last Axis naval attack in Australian waters until November 1941.Gill (1957). Page 410. Consequences of the raid on Nauru led to serious concern about the supply of phosphates from there and nearby Ocean Island, though the general situation with naval forces allowed only limited response to threats to the isolated islands.Gill (1957). Pages 282–283. There was some redeployment of warships and a proposal to deploy six inch naval guns to the islands despite provisions of the mandate prohibiting fortification but a shortage of such guns resulted in a change to a proposed two field guns for each island.Gill (1957). Page 284. The most serious effect of the raid was the fall in phosphate output in 1941 though decisions as early as 1938 to increase stockpiles of raw rock in Australia mitigated that decline.Gill (1957). Page 283. Another consequence was the institution of the first Trans-Tasman commercial convoys with Convoy VK.1 composed of , , Empress of Russia, and Maunganui leaving Sydney 30 December 1940 for Auckland escorted by . =German surface raiders in 1941= Following the raids on Nauru, Komet and Orion sailed for the Indian Ocean, passing through the Southern Ocean well to the south of Australia in February and March 1941 respectively. Komet re-entered the Australia station in April en route to New Zealand, and sailed east through the southern extreme of the Australia Station in August.Gill (1957). Pages 446–447. Until November, the only casualties from Axis ships on the Australia Station were caused by mines laid by Pinguin in 1940. The small trawler Millimumul was sunk with the loss of seven lives after striking a mine off the New South Wales coast on 26 March 1941, and two ratings from a Rendering Mines Safe party were killed while attempting to defuse a mine which had washed ashore in South Australia on 14 July. On 19 November 1941, the Australian light cruiser —which had been highly successful in the Battle of the Mediterranean—encountered the disguised German raider , approximately south west of Carnarvon, Western Australia. Sydney intercepted Kormoran and demanded that she prove her assumed identity as the Dutch freighter Straat Malakka. During the interception, Sydneys captain brought his ship dangerously close to Kormoran. As a result, when Kormoran was unable to prove her identity and avoid a battle she had little hope of surviving, the raider was able to use all her weaponry against Sydney. In the resulting battle, Kormoran and Sydney were both crippled, with Sydney sinking with the loss of all her 645 crew and 78 of Kormorans crew being either killed in the battle or dying before they could be rescued by passing ships.The action between HMAS Sydney and the auxiliary cruiser Kormoran, 19 November 1941, Australian War Memorial, accessed 12 June 2006 Kormoran was the only Axis ship to conduct attacks in Australian waters during 1941 and the last Axis surface raider to enter Australian waters until 1943. There is no evidence to support claims that a Japanese submarine participated in the sinking of HMAS Sydney.Tom Frame (1993). HMAS Sydney. Loss and Controversy. Hodder & Stoughton, Sydney. Page 177. The only German ship to enter the Australia Station during 1942 was the blockade runner and supply ship Ramses, which was sunk by and HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerk on 26 November, shortly after Ramses left Batavia bound for France. All of Ramses crew survived the sinking and were taken prisoner.Gill (1968). Pages 197–198. 1942 The Allied shipping lines between the U.S. and Australia and New Zealand in July 1942. The Australian end of these shipping lines was targeted by Japanese submarines between May and August 1942. The naval threat to Australia increased dramatically following the outbreak of war in the Pacific. During the first half of 1942, the Japanese mounted a sustained campaign in Australian waters, with Japanese submarines attacking shipping and aircraft carriers conducting a devastating attack on the strategic port of Darwin. In response to these attacks the Allies increased the resources allocated to protecting shipping in Australian waters.Stevens (2005). Page 330. =Early Japanese submarine patrols (January–March 1942)= The first Japanese submarines to enter Australian waters were , , and , from the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN's) Submarine Squadron 6. Acting in support of the Japanese offensive in the Netherlands East Indies these boats laid minefields in the approaches to Darwin and the Torres Strait between 12 and 18 January 1942. These mines did not sink or damage any Allied ships.Stevens (2005). Page 183. After completing their mine laying missions the four Japanese boats took station off Darwin to provide the Japanese fleet with warning of Allied naval movements. On 20 January 1942 the Australian Bathurst-class corvettes , and sank I-124 near Darwin. This was the only full-sized submarine sunk by the Royal Australian Navy in Australian waters during World War II.Stevens (2005). Pages 183–184. The only other Axis submarines sunk in Australian waters were two of the three midget submarines which entered Sydney Harbour in May 1942. Being the first accessible ocean-going IJN submarine lost after Pearl Harbor, USN divers attempted to enter I-124 in order to obtain its code books, but were unsuccessful.McCarthy, M., (1990) HIJMS Submarine I 124. (1990) Report_ Department of Maritime Archaeology Western Australian Maritime Museum, No 43 The Japanese submarine . Following the conquest of the western Pacific the Japanese mounted a number of reconnaissance patrols into Australian waters. Three submarines (, and ) operated off Western Australia in March 1942, sinking the merchant ships Parigi and Siantar on 1 and 3 March respectively. In addition, conducted a reconnaissance patrol down the Australian east coast in February and March. During this patrol Nobuo Fujita from the I-25 flew a Yokosuka E14Y1 floatplane over Sydney (17 February), Melbourne (26 February) and Hobart (1 March).Stevens (2005). Pages 185–186. Following these reconnaissances, I-25 sailed for New Zealand and conducted overflights of Wellington and Auckland on 8 and 13 March respectively.Sydney David Waters (1956), The Royal New Zealand Navy. Historical Publications Branch, Wellington. Pages 214–215. =Japanese naval aviation attacks (February 1942 – November 1943)= A sunken ship and burnt-out wharf in Darwin Harbour following the first Japanese air raid. The bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942, was the heaviest single attack mounted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against mainland Australia. On 19 February, four Japanese aircraft carriers (, , and ) launched a total of 188 aircraft from a position in the Timor Sea. The four carriers were escorted by four cruisers and nine destroyers.Tom Lewis (2003). A War at Home. A Comprehensive guide to the first Japanese attacks on Darwin. Tall Stories, Darwin. Page 16. These 188 naval aircraft inflicted heavy damage on Darwin and sank nine ships. A raid conducted by 54 land-based bombers later the same day resulted in further damage to the town and RAAF Base Darwin and the destruction of 20 Allied military aircraft. Allied casualties were 236 killed and between 300 and 400 wounded, the majority of whom were non-Australian Allied sailors. Only four Japanese aircraft were confirmed to have been destroyed by Darwin's defenders.David Jenkins (1992), Battle Surface! Japan's Submarine War Against Australia 1942–44. Random House Australia, Sydney. Pages 118–120 and Lewis (2003). Pages 63–71. The bombing of Darwin was the first of many Japanese naval aviation attacks against targets in Australia. The carriers , and —which escorted the invasion force dispatched against Port Moresby in May 1942—had the secondary role of attacking Allied bases in northern Queensland once Port Moresby was secured.Samuel Eliot Morison (1949 (2001 reprint)). Coral Sea, Midway and Submarine Actions, May 1942 – August 1942, Volume 4 of History of United States Naval Operations in World War II. University of Illinois Press, Champaign. Pages 12–13. These attacks did not occur, however, as the landings at Port Moresby were cancelled when the Japanese carrier force was mauled in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Japanese aircraft made almost 100 raids, most of them small, against northern Australia during 1942 and 1943. Land-based IJN aircraft took part in many of the 63 raids on Darwin which took place after the initial attack. The town of Broome, Western Australia experienced a devastating attack by IJN fighter planes on 3 March 1942, in which at least 88 people were killed. Long-range seaplanes operating from bases in the Solomon Islands made a number of small attacks on towns in Queensland.Jenkins (1992). Pages 261–262. Japanese naval aircraft operating from land bases also harassed coastal shipping in Australia's northern waters during 1942 and 1943. On 15 December 1942, four sailors were killed when the merchant ship Period was attacked off Cape Wessel. The small general purpose vessel was sunk by a Japanese floatplane near the Wessel Islands on 22 January 1943 with the loss of nine sailors and civilians. Another civilian sailor was killed when the merchant ship Islander was attacked by a floatplane during May 1943.Gill (1968). Pages 264–266. =Attacks on Sydney and Newcastle (May–June 1942)= HMAS Kuttabul following the attack on Sydney. In March 1942, the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia.David Horner (1993). 'Defending Australia in 1942' in War and Society, Volume 11, Number 1, May 1993. Pages 4–5. This plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway.Horner (1993). Page 10. Following the defeat of the Japanese surface fleet, the IJN submarines were deployed to disrupt Allied supply lines by attacking shipping off the Australian east coast. On 27 April 1942, the submarines and left the major Japanese naval base at Truk Lagoon in the Japanese territory of the Caroline Islands to conduct reconnaissance patrols of Allied ports in the South Pacific. The goal of these patrols was to find a suitable target for the force of midget submarines, designated the Eastern Detachment of the Second Special Attack Flotilla, which was available in the Pacific.Jenkins (1992). Page 163. I-29 entered Australian waters in May and made an unsuccessful attack on the neutral Soviet freighter Wellen off Newcastle on 16 May. I-29s floatplane overflew Sydney on 23 May 1942, finding a large number of major Allied warships in Sydney Harbour.Stevens (2005). Pages 191–192. I-21 reconnoitred Suva, Fiji and Auckland, New Zealand in late May but did not find worthwhile concentrations of shipping in either port.Jenkins (1992). Page 165. On 18 May, the Eastern Detachment of the Second Special Attack Flotilla left Truk Lagoon under the command of Captain Hankyu Sasaki. Sasaki's force comprised , and . Each submarine was carrying a midget submarine.Jenkins (1992). Pages 163–164. After the intelligence gathered by I-21 and I-29 was assessed, the three submarines were ordered on 24 May to attack Sydney.Jenkins (1992). Page 171. The three submarines of the Eastern Detachment rendezvoused with I-21 and I-29 off Sydney on 29 May.Jenkins (1992). Pages 174–175. In the early hours of 30 May, I-21s floatplane conducted a reconnaissance flight over Sydney Harbour that confirmed the concentration of Allied shipping sighted by I-29s floatplane was still present and was a worthwhile target for a midget submarine raid.Jenkins (1992). Pages 185–193. A Japanese midget submarine being raised from Sydney Harbour On the night of 31 May, three midget submarines were launched from the Japanese force outside the Sydney Heads. Although two of the submarines (Midget No. 22 and Midget A, also known as Midget 24) successfully penetrated the incomplete Sydney Harbour defences, only Midget A actually attacked Allied shipping in the harbour, firing two torpedoes at the American heavy cruiser . These torpedoes missed Chicago but sank the depot ship , killing 21 seamen on board, and seriously damaged the Dutch submarine . All of the Japanese midget submarines were lost during this operation (Midget No. 22 and Midget No. 27 were destroyed by the Australian defenders and Midget A was scuttled by her crew after leaving the Harbour).Robert Nichols 'The Night the War Came to Sydney' in Wartime Issue 33, 2006. Pages 26–29 Following this raid, the Japanese submarine force operated off Sydney and Newcastle, sinking the coaster Iron Chieftain off Sydney on 3 June. On the night of 8 June, I-24 conducted a bombardment of the eastern suburbs of Sydney and I-21 bombarded Newcastle. Fort Scratchley at Newcastle returned fire, but did not hit I-21. While these bombardments did not cause any casualties or serious damage, they generated concern over further attacks against the east coast.Stevens (2005). Page 195. Following the attacks on shipping in the Sydney region, the Royal Australian Navy instituted convoys between Brisbane and Adelaide. All ships of over and with speeds of less than were required to sail in convoy when travelling between cities on the east coast. The Japanese submarine force left Australian waters in late June 1942 having sunk a further two merchant ships.G. Herman Gill (1968). Australia in the War of 1939–1945. Series 2 – Navy. Volume II – Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945. Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Pages 77–78. The small number of sinkings achieved by the five Japanese submarines sent against the Australian east coast in May and June did not justify the commitment of so many submarines.Jenkins (1992). Page 291. =Further Japanese submarine patrols (July–August 1942)= Damage to the merchant ship SS Allara after she was torpedoed off Newcastle in July 1942. The Australian authorities enjoyed only a brief break in the submarine threat. In July 1942, three submarines (, and ) from Japanese Submarine Squadron 3 commenced operations off the East Coast. These three submarines sank five ships (including the small fishing trawler Dureenbee) and damaged several others during July and August. In addition, conducted a patrol off the southern coast of Australia while en route from New Caledonia to Penang, though the submarine was not successful in sinking any ships in this area. Following the withdrawal of this force in August, no further submarine attacks were mounted against Australia until January 1943.Stevens (2005). Page 201. While Japanese submarines sank 17 ships in Australian waters in 1942 (14 of which were near the Australian coast) the submarine offensive did not have a serious impact on the Allied war effort in the South West Pacific or the Australian economy. Nevertheless, by forcing ships sailing along the east coast to travel in convoy the Japanese submarines were successful in reducing the efficiency of Australian coastal shipping. This lower efficiency translated into between 7.5% and 22% less tonnage being transported between Australian ports each month (no accurate figures are available and the estimated figure varied between months).Stevens (2005). Pages 206–207. These convoys were effective, however, with no ship travelling as part of a convoy being sunk in Australian waters during 1942.Stevens (2005). Page 205. 1943 U.S.-registered Liberty ship Starr King sinking after being attacked near Port Macquarie on 10 February 1943. Japanese submarines returned to Australian waters in January 1943 and conducted a campaign against Australian shipping during the first half of the year. The IJN also conducted a diversionary bombardment of Port Gregory, a small West Australian town. =East coast submarine patrols (January–June 1943)= Japanese submarine operations against Australia in 1943 began when and I-21 sailed from Rabaul on 7 January to reconnoitre Allied forces around Nouméa and Sydney respectively. I-21 arrived off the coast of New South Wales just over a week later. I-21 operated off the east coast until late February and sank six ships during this period, making it the most successful submarine patrol conducted in Australian waters during the Second World War.Stevens (2005). Pages 218–220. In addition to these sinkings, I-21s floatplane conducted a successful reconnaissance of Sydney Harbour on 19 February 1943.Jenkins (1992). Pages 268–272. In March, and entered Australian waters. While I-6 laid nine German-supplied acoustic mines in the approaches to Brisbane this minefield was discovered by and neutralised before any ships were sunk.Stevens (2005). Pages 223–224. Although I-6 returned to Rabaul after laying her mines, the Japanese submarine force in Australian waters was expanded in April when the four submarines of Submarine Squadron 3 (I-11, , and ) arrived off the east coast and joined I-26. This force had the goal of attacking reinforcement and supply convoys travelling between Australia and New Guinea.Jenkins (1992). Pages 272–273. As the Japanese force was too small to cut off all traffic between Australia and New Guinea, the Squadron commander widely dispersed his submarines between the Torres Strait and Wilson's Promontory with the goal of tying down as many Allied ships and aircraft as possible. This offensive continued until June and the five Japanese submarines sank nine ships and damaged several others.Stevens (2005). Pages 230–231. In contrast to 1942, five of the ships sunk off the Australian east coast were travelling in escorted convoys at the time they were attacked. The convoy escorts were not successful in detecting any submarines before they launched their attacks or counter-attacking these submarines.Gill (1968). Pages 253–262. The last attack by a Japanese submarine off the east coast of Australia was made by I-174 on 16 June 1943 when she sank the merchant ship Portmar and damaged U.S. Landing Ship Tank LST-469 as they were travelling in Convoy GP55 off the New South Wales north coast.Gill (1968). Pages 261–262. Some historians believe that RAAF aircraft searching for I-174 may have sunk I-178 during the early hours of 18 June, but the cause of this submarine's loss during a patrol off eastern Australia has not been confirmed.Crowhust (2012). Pages 29–30 AHS Centaur. The single greatest loss of life resulting from a submarine attack in Australian waters occurred in the early hours of 14 May 1943 when torpedoed and sank the Australian hospital ship Centaur off Point Lookout, Queensland. After being hit by a single torpedo, Centaur sank in less than three minutes with the loss of 268 lives. While hospital ships—such as Centaur—were legally protected against attack under the terms of the Geneva Conventions, it is unclear whether Commander Hajime Nakagawa of I-177 was aware that Centaur was a hospital ship. While she was clearly marked with a red cross and was fully illuminated, the light conditions at the time may have resulted in Nakagawa not being aware of Centaurs status, making her sinking a tragic accident. However, as Nakagawa had a poor record as a submarine captain and was later convicted of machine gunning the survivors of a British merchant ship in the Indian Ocean, it is probable that the sinking of Centaur was due to either Nakagawa's incompetence or indifference to the laws of warfare.Jenkins (1992). Pages 277–285. The attack on Centaur sparked widespread public outrage in Australia.Tom Frame (2004), No Pleasure Cruise: The Story of the Royal Australian Navy. Allen & Unwin, Sydney. Pages 186–187. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia was broken off in July 1943 when the submarines were redeployed to counter Allied offensives elsewhere in the Pacific. The last two Japanese submarines to be dispatched against the Australian east coast, I-177 and I-180, were redirected to the central Solomon Islands shortly before they would have arrived off Australia in July.Stevens (2005). Page 246. The Australian Naval authorities were concerned about a resumption of attacks, however, and maintained the coastal convoy system until late 1943 when it was clear that the threat had passed. Coastal convoys in waters south of Newcastle ceased on 7 December and convoys off the north-east coast and between Australia and New Guinea were abolished in February and March 1944 respectively.Stevens (2005). Pages 246–248. =Bombardment of Port Gregory (January 1943)= In contrast to the large number of submarines which operated off the east coast, only a single Japanese submarine was dispatched against the Australian west coast. On 21 January 1943, left her base at Surabaya, East Java, destined for Western Australia. The submarine—under Lt. Cdr. Kennosuke Torisu—was tasked with creating a diversion to assist the evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal following their defeat there. Another submarine——had undertaken a diversionary bombardment of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands on 25 December 1942.David Stevens, 'Forgotten assault' in Wartime Issue 18, 2002. It appears that Torisu's original objective was to bombard the port of Geraldton, Western Australia. After a six-day voyage southward, I-165 reached Geraldton on 27 January. However, Torisu believed that he had sighted lights of aircraft or a destroyer near the town and broke off his attack. I-165 instead headed north for Port Gregory a former whaling, lead and salt port. At around midnight on 28 January, the submarine's crew fired 10 rounds from her deck gun at the town. The shells appear to have completely missed Port Gregory and did not result in any damage or casualties for the town was not occupied and the raid initially went unnoticed.Jenkins (1992). Pages 266–267. While gunfire was sighted by nearby coastwatchers, Allied naval authorities only learned of the attack when Lt. Cdr. Torisu's battle report radio signal was intercepted and decoded a week later. As a result, the attack was not successful in diverting attention away from Guadalcanal.Stevens (2002) I-165 returned twice to Australian waters. In September 1943, she made an uneventful reconnaissance of the north west coast. I-165 conducted another reconnaissance patrol off north western Australian between 31 May and 5 July 1944. This was the last time a Japanese submarine entered Australian waters.Jenkins (1992). Page 286. =German raider Michel (June 1943)= Norwegian tanker Ferncastle docked at Fremantle was the final German surface raider to enter Australian waters and the Pacific. Michel departed from Yokohama, Japan on her second raiding cruise on 21 May 1943 and entered the Indian Ocean in June. On 14 June she sank the Norwegian tanker Høegh SilverdawnWarsailors.com: M/T Høegh Silverdawn about north-west of Fremantle. Michel followed up this success two days later by sinking a second Norwegian tanker, the Ferncastle,Warsailors.com: M/T Ferncastle in the same area. Both tankers were sailing from Western Australia to the Middle East and 47 Allied sailors and passengers were killed as a result of the attacks. Following these sinkings Michel sailed well to the south of Australia and New Zealand and operated in the eastern Pacific. On 3 September, she sank the Norwegian tanker IndiaWarsailors.com: M/T India west of Easter Island with all hands, while the tanker was sailing from Peru to Australia.Gill (1968). Page 297 and Bismarck- class.dk Hilfskreuzer (Auxiliary Cruiser) Michel. Accessed 3 June 2007. 1944–1945 The Axis naval threat to Australia declined in line with the Allied successes in the Pacific Theatre in 1944, and only three ships were sunk by Axis naval vessels on the Australia Station during 1944 and 1945. While the Japanese conducted their only landing on the Australian mainland during 1944, this was a small reconnaissance operation. As the threat from Axis attacks declined the Allies further reduced the forces assigned to protecting shipping in Australian waters. These forces were not completely disbanded until the end of the war, however. =Landing in the Kimberley (January 1944)= While the Japanese government never adopted proposals to invade Australia,Peter Stanley (2002). He's (Not) Coming South: The Invasion That Wasn't a single reconnaissance landing was made on the Australian mainland. Between 17 and 20 January 1944, members of a Japanese intelligence unit named Matsu Kikan (\\"Pine Tree\\") made a reconnaissance mission to a sparsely populated area on the far north coast of the Kimberley region of Western Australia.Peter Dunn Japanese Army reconnaissance party landed in Western Australia near Cartier and Brows Islands. Accessed 29 June 2006. The unit, operating from Kupang, West Timor, used a converted civilian vessel called Hiyoshi Maru and posed as a fishing crew. The mission was led by Lt Susuhiko Mizuno of the Japanese Army and included another three Japanese army personnel, six Japanese naval personnel and 15 West Timorese sailors. Their orders, from the 19th Army headquarters at Ambon, were to verify reports that the U.S. Navy was building a base in the area. In addition, the Matsu Kikan personnel were ordered to collect information which would assist any covert reconnaissance or raiding missions on the Australian mainland.Henry P. Frei (1991), Japan's Southward Advance and Australia. From the Sixteenth Century to World War II. Melbourne University Press, Melbourne. Page 173. Hiyoshi Maru left Kupang on 16 January and was given air cover for the outward leg by an Aichi D3A2 \\"Val\\" dive bomber which reportedly attacked an Allied submarine en route. On 17 January, Hiyoshi Maru visited the Ashmore Reef area. The following day the crew landed on the tiny and uninhabited Browse Island, about north west of the mainland. On the morning of 19 January, Hiyoshi Maru entered York Sound on the mainland. Although the crew saw smoke emanating from hills to the east of their location, they nevertheless anchored and camouflaged the vessel with tree branches. Local historians state that Matsu Kikan landing parties went ashore near the mouth of the Roe River ().Daphne Choules Edinger, 1995, \\"Exploring the Kimberley Coast\\" and; Cathie Clement, 1995, \\"World War II and the Kimberley\\" (The Kimberley Society) They reportedly explored onshore for about two hours, and some members of the mission filmed the area using an 8 mm camera. The Matsu Kikan personnel spent the night on the boat and reconnoitred the area again the following day, before returning to Kupang. The Japanese did not sight any people or signs of recent human activity and little of military significance was learnt from the mission. =Japanese operations in the Indian Ocean (March 1944)= The Japanese heavy cruiser . In February 1944, the Japanese Combined Fleet withdrew from its base at Truk and was divided between Palau and Singapore. The appearance of a powerful Japanese squadron at Singapore concerned the Allies, as it was feared that this force could potentially conduct raids in the Indian Ocean and against Western Australia.Odgers (1968). Pages 134–135. On 1 March, a Japanese squadron consisting of the heavy cruisers (flagship), and —under Vice Admiral Naomasa Sakonju—sortied from Sunda Strait to attack Allied shipping sailing on the main route between Aden and Fremantle. The only Allied ship this squadron encountered was the British steamer Behar, which was sunk midway between Ceylon and Fremantle on 9 March. Following this attack the squadron broke off its mission and returned to Batavia as it was feared that Allied ships responding to Behar's distress signal posed an unacceptable risk. While 102 survivors from Behar were rescued by Tone, 82 of these prisoners were murdered after the cruiser arrived in Batavia on 16 March. Following the war Vice Adm. Sakonju was executed for war crimes which included the killing of these prisoners, while the former commander of Tone, Capt. Haruo Mayazumi, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.Children & Families of Far East Prisoners of War. The Behar. Accessed 21 July 2017. The sortie mounted by Aoba, Tone and Chikuma was the last raid mounted by Axis surface ships against the Allied lines of communication in the Indian Ocean, or elsewhere, during World War II.Gill (1968). Page 390 While the Japanese raid into the Indian Ocean was not successful, associated Japanese shipping movements provoked a major Allied response. In early March 1944, Allied intelligence reported that two battleships escorted by destroyers had left Singapore in the direction of Surabaya and a U.S. submarine made radar contact with two large Japanese ships in the Lombok Strait. The Australian Chiefs of Staff Committee reported to the Government on 8 March that there was a possibility that these ships could have entered the Indian Ocean to attack Fremantle. In response to this report, all ground and naval defences at Fremantle were fully manned, all shipping was ordered to leave Fremantle and several RAAF squadrons were redeployed to bases in Western Australia.Odgers (1968). Pages 136–139. This alert proved to be a false alarm, however. The Japanese ships detected in the Lombok Strait were actually the light cruisers and which were covering the return of the surface raiding force from the central Indian Ocean. The alert was lifted at Fremantle on 13 March and the RAAF squadrons began returning to their bases in eastern and northern Australia on 20 March.Gill (1968). Pages 390–391. =The German submarine offensive (September 1944 – January 1945)= On 14 September 1944, the commander of the Kriegsmarine—Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Karl Dönitz—approved a proposal to send two Type IXD U-Boats into Australian waters with the objective of tying down Allied anti-submarine assets in a secondary theatre. The U-Boats involved were drawn from the Monsun Gruppe (\\"Monsoon Group\\"), and the two selected for this operation were and .Stevens (2005). Page 262. An additional submarine——was added to this force at the end of September.David Stevens (1997), U-Boat Far from Home. Allen & Unwin, Sydney. Page 119. Two Type IX submarines similar to those dispatched to operate against Australia Due to the difficulty of maintaining German submarines in Japanese bases, the German force was not ready to depart from its bases in Penang and Batavia (Jakarta) until early October. By this time, the Allies had intercepted and decoded German and Japanese messages describing the operation and were able to vector Allied submarines onto the German boats. The Dutch submarine Zwaardvisch sank U-168 on 6 October near SurabayaPaul Kemp (1997), U-Boats Destroyed. German Submarine Losses in the World Wars. Arms and Armour, London. Page 221. and the American submarine sank U-537 on 10 November near the northern end of the Lombok Strait.Kemp (1997). Page 224. Due to the priority accorded to the Australian operation, was ordered to replace U-168.Stevens (1997). Page 124. However, U-196 disappeared in the Sunda Strait some time after departing from Penang on 30 November. The cause of U-196s loss is unknown, though it was probably due to an accident or mechanical fault.Kemp (1997). Page 225. Kemp suggests that U-196 may have been lost in a diving accident or due to a fault in the boat's locally constructed snorkel. The only surviving submarine of the force assigned to attack Australia—, under Korvettenkapitän Heinrich Timm had left Kiel in May 1944 and reached Penang on 9 September, sinking five merchantmen on the way. She departed Batavia on 18 November 1944, and arrived off the south west tip of Western Australia on 26 November. The submarine had great difficulty finding targets as the Australian naval authorities, warned of U-862s approach, had directed shipping away from the routes normally used. U-862 unsuccessfully attacked the Greek freighter Ilissos off the South Australian coast on 9 December, with bad weather spoiling both the attack and subsequent Australian efforts to locate the submarine.Stevens (1997). Pages 147–151. Following her attack on Ilissos, U-862 continued east along the Australian coastline, becoming the only German submarine to operate in the Pacific Ocean during the Second World War.Uboat.net The Monsun boats. Accessed 5 August 2006. After entering the Pacific U-862 scored her first success on this patrol when she attacked the U.S.-registered Liberty ship Robert J. Walker off the South Coast of New South Wales on 24 December 1944. The ship sank the following day. Following this attack, U-862 evaded an intensive search by Australian aircraft and warships and departed for New Zealand.Stevens (1997). Pages 159–173. As U-862 did not find any worthwhile targets off New Zealand, the submarine's commander planned to return to Australian waters in January 1945 and operate to the north of Sydney. U-862 was ordered to break off her mission in mid-January, however, and return to Jakarta.Stevens (2005). Page 278. On her return voyage, the submarine sank another U.S. Liberty ship—Peter Silvester—approximately southwest of Fremantle on 6 February 1945. Peter Silvester was the last Allied ship to be sunk by the Axis in the Indian Ocean during the war.Gill (1968). Page 557. U-862 arrived in Jakarta in mid February 1945 and is the only Axis ship known to have operated in Australian waters during 1945. Following Germany's surrender, U-862 became the Japanese submarine but was not used operationally.Stevens (1997). Page 222. While Allied naval authorities were aware of the approach of the German strike force and were successful in sinking two of the four submarines dispatched, efforts to locate and sink U-862 once she reached Australian waters were continually hampered by a lack of suitable ships and aircraft and a lack of personnel trained and experienced in anti-submarine warfare.Stevens (2005). Page 258. As the southern coast of Australia was thousands of kilometres behind the active combat front in South- East Asia and had not been raided for several years, it should not be considered surprising that few anti-submarine assets were available in this area in late 1944 and early 1945.Stevens (1997).

The caption and design deliberately exaggerate the threat Japanese submarines posed to Australia.Caption to the copy of this poster on display in the Second World War gallery of the Australian War Memorial =Casualties= A total of six German surface raiders, four Japanese aircraft carriers, seven Japanese cruisers, nine Japanese destroyers and twenty eight Japanese and German submarines operated in Australian waters between 1940 and 1945. These 54 warships sank 53 merchant ships and three warships within the Australia Station, resulting in the deaths of over 1,751 Allied military personnel, sailors and civilians. Over 88 people were also killed by IJN air attacks on towns in northern Australia. In exchange, the Allies sank one German surface raider, one full-sized Japanese submarine and two midget submarines within Australian waters, resulting in the deaths of 157 Axis sailors. A further two German submarines were sunk while en route to Australian waters with the loss of 81 sailors.Uboat.net U-168 and U-537. Accessed 7 October 2006. * The six German and three Japanese surface raiders that operated within Australian waters sank 18 ships and killed over 826 sailors (including the 82 prisoners murdered on board Tone in 1944). Kormoran was the only Axis surface ship to be sunk within the Australia Station, and 78 of her crew were killed.Figures compiled from Gill (1957). * The 17 ships in the Japanese carrier force that raided Darwin in 1942 sank nine ships and killed 251 people for the loss of four aircraft.Lewis (2003). A further 14 sailors and civilians were killed in the sinking of HMAS Patricia Cam and the attacks on Period and Islander in 1943 and 88 people were killed during the raid on Broome in 1942. * The 28 Japanese and German submarines that operated in Australian waters between 1942 and 1945 sank a total of 30 ships with a combined tonnage of ; 654 people, including 200 Australian merchant seamen, were killed on board the ships attacked by submarines.Jenkins (1992). Pages 286–287. It has also been estimated that the RAAF lost at least 23 aircraft and 104 airmen to flying accidents during anti-submarine patrols off the Australian coast.David Joseph Wilson (2003) The Eagle and the Albatross : Australian Aerial Maritime Operations 1921–1971. PhD thesis. Page 120. In exchange, the Allies sank only a single full-sized Japanese submarine in Australian waters (I-124) and two of the three midgets that entered Sydney Harbour. A total of 79 Japanese sailors died in these sinkings, and a further two sailors died on board the third midget, which was scuttled after leaving Sydney Harbour.Figures compiled from Jenkins (1992). =Assessment= While the scale of the Axis naval offensive directed against Australia was small compared to other naval campaigns of the war such as the Battle of the Atlantic, they were still \\"the most comprehensive and widespread series of offensive operations ever conducted by an enemy against Australia\\".David Stevens. Japanese submarine operations against Australia 1942–1944 . Accessed 1 September 2006. Due to the limited size of the Australian shipping industry and the importance of sea transport to the Australian economy and Allied military in the South West Pacific, even modest shipping losses had the potential to seriously damage the Allied war effort in the South West Pacific. Despite the vulnerability of the Australian shipping industry, the Axis attacks did not seriously affect the Australian or Allied war effort. While the German surface raiders which operated against Australia caused considerable disruption to merchant shipping and tied down Allied naval vessels, they did not sink many ships and only operated in Australian waters for a few short periods.Alastair Cooper (2001). The effectiveness of the Japanese submarine campaign against Australia was limited by the inadequate numbers of submarines committed and flaws in Japan's submarine doctrine. The submarines were, however, successful in forcing the Allies to devote considerable resources to protecting shipping in Australian waters between 1942 and late 1943.Stevens. Japanese submarine operations against Australia 1942–1944 . Accessed 1 September 2006. The institution of coastal convoys between 1942 and 1943 may have also significantly reduced the efficiency of the Australian shipping industry during this period.Stevens (2005). Page 334. The performance of the Australian and Allied forces committed to the defence of shipping on the Australia station was mixed. While the threat to Australia from Axis raiders was \\"anticipated and addressed\\", Seapower Centre – Australia (2005). The Navy Contribution to Australian Maritime Operations . Defence Publishing Service, Canberra. Page 179. only a small proportion of the Axis ships and submarines which attacked Australia were successfully located or engaged. Several German raiders operated undetected within Australian waters in 1940 as the number of Allied warships and aircraft available were not sufficient to patrol these watersGavin Long (1973), The Six Years War. A Concise History of Australia in the 1939–45 War. Australian War Memorial and Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra. Page 33. and the loss of HMAS Sydney was a high price to pay for sinking Kormoran in 1941. While the Australian authorities were quick to implement convoys in 1942 and no convoyed ship was sunk during that year, the escorts of the convoys that were attacked in 1943 were not successful in either detecting any submarines before they launched their attack or successfully counter-attacking these submarines.Stevens (2005). Page 331. Factors explaining the relatively poor performance of Australian anti- submarine forces include their typically low levels of experience and training, shortages of ASW assets, problems with co-ordinating searches and the poor sonar conditions in the waters surrounding Australia.Stevens (2005). Page 281. Nevertheless, \\"success in anti-submarine warfare cannot be measured simply by the total of sinkings achieved\\" and the Australian defenders may have successfully reduced the threat to shipping in Australian waters by making it harder for Japanese submarines to carry out attacks.Odgers (1968).

The game emphasizes speed of play and reduced preparation over realism or detail. The game received the 2003 Origin Gamers' Choice Award for best role-playing game. Settings Although Savage Worlds is a generic rules system, Pinnacle has released \\"Savage Settings\\"—campaign settings or modules designed specifically for the Savage Worlds rules. These have included Evernight, 50 Fathoms, Necessary Evil, Rippers, and Low Life. Pinnacle has also published setting books based on the company's earlier lines, including Deadlands: Reloaded as well as the Tour of Darkness, Necropolis, and Weird War II settings based on the Weird Wars line. Beginning with 50 Fathoms, the majority of settings released by Pinnacle feature a concept known as a \\"Plot Point Campaign\\". In such campaigns, a series of loosely defined adventure scenarios are presented. A main storyline is presented as a series of \\"Plot Points\\" and additional side-quests (or \\"Savage Tales\\") expand the scope of the campaign. This format allow a group of characters to explore the game universe while playing through (or disregarding) the main storyline in a manner similar to that of role-playing video games. A licensing system is in place for electronic and book publishers to release material for the Savage Worlds game. Such \\"Savaged!\\" licensees are allowed to use the Savage Worlds mascot \\"Smiling Jack\\" as a logo on their products. Multiple PDF adventure scenarios are available using this licensing system, as well as setting related supplements like the Vampire Earth RPG Sourcebook and the Suzerain Legends RPG meta setting. System =Character creation= Player characters are built using a point allocation system, though game masters are encouraged to design non-player characters to the needs of the game rather than to fit the system. Characters in Savage Worlds are composed of a variety of statistics. These include Race, Traits, Edges, Hindrances and sometimes Powers. Race A character's race usually refers to their species, which may grant or impose modifiers to characteristics. In some settings (such as the Pirates of the Spanish Main RPG) this may instead refer to nationality, which typically does not. Nationality based differences may occur in campaigns where certain Skill specializations, Edges and Hindrances are affected by cultural or technological differences or are included to add flavor to a character. For instance, in Deadlands: Reloaded a non-Chinese character may learn Chinese Martial Arts but cannot acquire and use its Chi-based Powers. In Weird War II American, British, or French soldiers have special Edges and Hindrances to reflect their different national and military cultures. Traits (Attributes & Skills) A character's traits are characteristics that are rated by a single polyhedral die. The more sides the trait is rated in, the better the character is at the trait—ranging from a 4-sided die (d4—the lowest) to a 12-sided die (d12—the highest). So a character with a Strength trait of a ten- sided die (d10) is stronger than a character whose Strength trait is rated with a six-sided die (d6). Traits are divided into Attributes, which are inherent, and Skills, which are learned. The five Attributes used in Savage Worlds are Agility (Physical Precision and Speed), Smarts (Mental Power), Spirit (Willpower), Strength (Physical Power) and Vigor (Physical Health). Attributes start at Level 1 (d4) and cost one point per additional level; Level 1 (d4) in an Attribute would cost nothing and Level 5 (d12) would cost four points. The number of points assigned to spend on Attributes is usually 5 points, but can be more in certain gameworlds. Attributes are also used to set the point cost of skills in that Attribute's group. The player can buy levels in a Skill at cost as long as its level is lower than its controlling Attribute. The point cost doubles if the Skill level exceeds the controlling Attribute. For instance, Healing is a Smarts-based skill. If a character had a Smarts of Level 1 (4-sided die, or d4) and wants to buy the Healing skill at Level 2 (six-sided die, or d6), it will cost 3 points—one point for Healing at Level 1 (d4) and two points for Healing at Level 2 (d6). If they had a Smarts of Level 2 (or d6) it would only have cost 2 points—one point for Level 1 (d4) and another for Level 2 (d6). The number of points assigned to spend on Skills is usually 15 points, but can be more in certain gameworlds. In addition to Attributes a character has the following derived statistics: Pace (ground speed), Parry (the ability to defend one's self), Toughness (resistance to damage) and Charisma (presence and charm). Some setting supplements add a fifth derived statistic such as Reason (Problem Solving), Sanity (Mental Health) or Grit (Mental Strength) to reflect the special needs of the gameworld. Like in the FUDGE and FATE systems the skills are broad and allow the character to use them for a variety of related tasks. For instance, a character with Fighting would not just be skilled in fighting with their bare hands or with melee weapons. They might also be able to identify and counter an opponent's fighting style, know the name and reputation of a skilled fighter they meet, figure out the nationality and rank of a soldier by their uniform and insignia, or locate and hire a mercenary or bodyguard. Healing could be used to diagnose an illness, identify medicinal herbs or pharmaceutical drugs, find a healer or medical specialist, or prevent a disease outbreak in an encampment by organizing sanitation protocols. Edges and Hindrances Characters are also customized with advantages and disadvantages known as Edges and Hindrances. Edges and Hindrances, unlike Traits, are not rated with dice. Edges (character advantages) cost points, are based on their character Rank (Novice, Seasoned, Veteran, Heroic, or Legendary), and are unlocked as the character levels up. They are also grouped by Type, which may—depending on the campaign or world—affect their availability. Beginning Edges can only be granted at character creation. Social Edges affect interaction skills. Combat Edges affect the character's fighting skills and Leadership Edges affect group or massed combat. Professional Edges are related to the character's job or role and affects their career skills. Power, Weird, or Wild Card Edges are supernatural, paranormal, or superhuman advantages and grant bonuses to Powers; they may not be available in mundane game worlds. Hindrances (character disadvantages) grant points and are ranked as Minor (which grants a character point) or Major (which grants two character points). Powers Some gameworlds have the option of granting superhuman abilities to characters—usually with a magical, mystical, technological, psionic, racial, or mutant origin. They are ranked like Edges (Novice, Seasoned, Veteran, Heroic, or Legendary) and can be expanded by leveling up. =Task resolution= Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of character actions and interactions in the game. Usually a trait die is rolled against a target number of four. If the roll equals or exceeds the target number, the action succeeds; otherwise it fails. If a player rolls the highest number possible on a given die (such as an 8 on an eight-sided die), the die may be re-rolled and its result added to the initial roll. This is known as \\"Acing\\". A die may continue to Ace as long as the highest die number is rolled. Player characters and significant non-player characters are known as \\"Wild Cards\\". Wild Cards get to roll a second die, known as a \\"Wild Die\\", alongside their trait rolls. This roll may Ace as normal. The player of the Wild Card uses the higher of the two rolls (trait die or Wild Die) to determine the actual result of the roll. In addition Wild Cards also receive a number of Bennies (Slang for benefits, also called poker chips in Dead Lands) per session. These can be traded in to reduce or negate damage from a given attack, or to reroll a trait die, and are used as rewards for good play. Combat initiative is determined by a standard deck of playing cards (with two jokers); characters act in sequence according to the fall of the cards from highest to lowest. Ties are broken by suit (in order from best to worst, spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs). Jokers beat all other cards and additionally give bonuses on rolls made in the round one receives them. The deck is shuffled at the end of every round in which a joker was dealt. Any player that receives a Joker during initiative may take his action at any time during the round. So if he wishes to act first, or in response to another PC or NPC acting he may at any point. History In 1997, Pinnacle published Deadlands: the Great Rail Wars, a miniature wargame set in the \\"Weird West\\" world of Hensley's Deadlands role-playing game. The rules were a greatly simplified version of the full Deadlands system, focused on single-figure skirmishes. In 2003 the rules from The Great Rail Wars were revised and expanded into a generic, simple but complete role-playing system and retitled Savage Worlds. At Origins 2003, Savage Worlds was awarded the Gamer's Choice Award in the Roleplaying Game category. The main rulebook was revised and released as a PDF format eBook in late 2004, with a print version following in early 2005. The same year, Great White Games began releasing rules expansions in the form of several PDF format genre toolkit books. Self-contained miniature skirmish games based upon the Savage Worlds engine were also released in print and PDF form. Deadlands Reloaded, a version of the classic Pinnacle game using the Savage Worlds rules, was released in May 2006. In late 2005, Pinnacle entered into an agreement with WizKids to publish self-contained RPGs set in the worlds of Pirates, Rocketmen, and MageKnight using the Savage Worlds rules. Of the three licenses, only The Pirates of the Spanish Main RPG saw release, and was published in April 2007. Pinnacle released another licensed game, The Savage World of Solomon Kane, in 2007. In October 2007, Pinnacle released the Savage Worlds Explorer's Edition, a digest size paperback edition of the rules. It featured the revisions to melee damage rules first introduced in Deadlands Reloaded, as well as new chase rules, and was released at Origins 2007. At that event, Deadlands Reloaded won the Origins Award in the category of Best Roleplaying Game Supplement.Deadlands: Reloaded Wins Origins Award In August 2011, Pinnacle released Savage Worlds Deluxe, a hardcover and expanded version of the rules found in the Explorer's Edition. In August 2012, Pinnacle released the digest size paperback edition of the Deluxe rules, Savage Worlds Deluxe Explorer's Edition. In 2015 Pinnacle announced a series of supplements converting Rifts to the Savage Worlds system. In 2018 Pinnacle announced a new edition: Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (#SWADE). It funded in six minutes on Kickstarter, and went on to make $524,170 from 5,289 backers Kickstarter.

He served in both the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate, and was Virginia's first post-Reconstruction Republican Senator. Early life William L. Scott was born in Williamsburg, Virginia on July 1, 1915. He graduated from high school in St. Albans, West Virginia and began a career with the Government Printing Office. He received an LL.B. from National University School of Law (now George Washington University Law School) in 1938 and an LL.M. in 1939. Scott was admitted to the bar, and was employed as a trial attorney with the Department of Justice until 1966. Scott served in the United States Army during World War II, enlisting as a private in April 1945, and receiving his discharge later the same year as a result of the end of the war.William L. Scott at U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records, 1938-1946, National Archives and Records Administration He was later active in the American Legion.Biography, William L. Scott. Guide to the William Lloyd Scott papers, 1967-1979. George Mason University Libraries. He engaged in the private practice of law in Fairfax, Virginia from 1961 to 1966. In 1963 and 1965 he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Virginia State Senate. In 1965 he initially appeared to have won, but a recount showed that he had lost by 21 votes. United States House Scott won the Republican nomination for Virginia's 8th congressional district in 1966. He expected to face 18-term incumbent and House Rules Committee chairman Howard W. Smith, a conservative Democrat, but Smith lost renomination to a more liberal Democrat, State Delegate George Rawlings. With support from conservative Democrats as well as Republicans, Scott handily defeated Rawlings in November. He was easily re- elected twice, and served from January 3, 1967 to January 3, 1973. United States Senate In 1972, Scott won the Republican nomination for the United States Senate and defeated Democratic incumbent William B. Spong Jr. in a close race, making Scott the first Republican Senator from Virginia since Reconstruction. Scott benefited from Richard Nixon's landslide victory in that year's presidential election, with Nixon winning Virginia by almost 38 points and carrying all but one of the state's counties. Scott served one term, January 3, 1973 to January 1, 1979. He did not run for re-election in 1978, and resigned on January 1, 1979, two days before the end of his term. Scott's resignation enabled the Governor of Virginia to appoint the winner of the 1978 Senate election, John Warner, to fill the vacancy, giving Warner one day of seniority over other Senators who were elected in 1978.John William Warner at Congressional Biographical Directory During his Congressional service, Scott was criticized for excessive expenses incurred during his fact-finding trips abroad. Retirement and death In retirement Scott resided in Fairfax Station, Virginia. In his later years he suffered from Alzheimer's Disease and resided in a Fairfax nursing center. Scott died in Fairfax on February 14, 1997, and was interred at Fairfax Memorial Park in Fairfax. Racism Scott was frequently cited as an example of racism in Congress, and some of Scott's words and actions were reported in the media. At the time he was in office, Scott's views on race were considered mainstream in much of Virginia, where politics had long been dominated by the segregationist Byrd Organization. When criticizing the implementation of the Post Office's ZIP Code program, Scott was quoted as saying \\"the only reason we need zip codes is because niggers can't read.\\" In addition, his name appeared in an exposé of Congressional staff hiring practices as one of the members who had given \\"No Blacks\\" and other similar instructions to the Capitol Hill Placement Bureau. Scott was also alleged to have displayed anti-semitism while in Congress. One news report indicated that during a job interview, Scott was told that the applicant was Jewish, and he replied \\"Oh, I've got too many of them here now to hire you.\\" \\"Dumbest Member of Congress\\" A 1974 article in New Times by Nina Totenberg reported that Scott had been ranked at the top of the list of \\"The Ten Dumbest Members of Congress\\". Scott's critics cited many examples to support this claim. While being briefed about the military capabilities of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Scott reportedly confused missile silos for grain silos and said \\"Wait a minute! I'm not interested in agriculture. I want the military stuff.\\" In addition, 1975 press accounts of a trip he took to the Middle East stated that Scott was a \\"diplomat's nightmare\\" who mistook the Suez Canal for the Persian Gulf, refused to enter a mosque because it wasn't \\"a Christian building\\", and asked Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin \\"What is this Gaza stuff? I have never understood that.\\" Scott held a press conference to deny the claims of the New Times story, which had the effect of giving the allegation wider circulation and enhanced credibility.\\"Nina Totenberg\\", Current Biography Yearbook, 1996, pages 575–579. In 2000 and afterwards, journalist Harry Stein, who had provided much of the background information to Totenberg based on an earlier Stein article for another publication called The Private Faces of Bill Scott, said the articles had been a \\"vicious hatchet job\\", and agreed with Scott's assessment at the time that the articles were written by \\"some left-wing kids from Richmond with an agenda.\\" Stein went on to say that while Scott was a tempting target—roundly disliked by his colleagues and his staff, and widely regarded as incompetent—Stein and his colleagues had done Scott \\"a disservice\\" for which Stein expressed regret. Stein was noted for his liberal political point of view early in his career, but over time his politics became more conservative.

He lectures on constitutional interpretation, civil liberties, philosophy of law, and political philosophy. George, a Catholic, is considered one of the country's leading conservative intellectuals. In addition to his professorship at Princeton, he is the Herbert W. Vaughan senior fellow at the Witherspoon Institute, a research fellow at the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture, and is frequently a Visiting Professor at Harvard Law School. Early life and education George was born on July 10, 1955, and is of Syrian and Italian descent. He grew up in Morgantown, West Virginia, the grandson of immigrant coal miners. He was educated at Swarthmore College (BA), Harvard Law School (JD), Harvard Divinity School (MTS), and University of Oxford (DPhil, BCL, DCL, and DLitt). As a doctoral student at Oxford, he studied philosophy of law under the supervision of John Finnis and Joseph Raz, and served as a Lecturer in Jurisprudence in New College. Academic career George speaking in 2014 George joined the faculty of Princeton University as an instructor in 1985, and in the following year became a tenure-track assistant professor. He spent 1988–89 on sabbatical leave as a Visiting Fellow in Law at Oxford University, working on his book Making Men Moral: Civil Liberties and Public Morality (1993, Oxford University Press). George was promoted to associate professor with tenure at Princeton in 1994, and to professor in 1999, being named to Princeton's McCormick Chair of Jurisprudence, a celebrated endowed professorship previously held by Woodrow Wilson, Edward S. Corwin, Alpheus T. Mason, William F. Willoughby, and Walter F. Murphy. George founded Princeton's James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions in 2000 and continues to serve as its director. Since 2007, George has been teaching undergraduate seminars on leading thinkers in Western intellectual history with friend and colleague Cornel West, a leading left-wing public intellectual;Dyson, Michael Eric (2015). \\"The Ghost of Cornel West,\\" The New Republic, April 19.

In 2017, George and West did a three-hour interview together on C-Span's \\"Book Notes.\\" They have also appeared together at colleges and universities around the country, arguing for civil dialogue and a broad conception of campus freedom of speech as essential to the truth-seeking mission of academic institutions. In March 2017, they jointly published the statement \\"Truth-Seeking, Democracy, and Freedom of Thought and Expression,\\" which has been signed by several thousand professors, students, academic administrators and others. In April 2019, George and West participated in an \\"assembly series\\" discussion at Washington University in St. Louis titled \\"Liberal Arts Education: What’s The Point?\\". Other professional and public service activities George is of counsel to the law firm of Robinson & McElwee PLLC in Charleston, West Virginia. George served from 1993–1998 as a presidential appointee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and from 2002–2009 as a member of the President's Council on Bioethics. George was appointed to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom by the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012, and in the following year was elected Chairman of the Commission. He served until hitting the statutory term limit in 2016. He is a former Judicial Fellow at the Supreme Court of the United States, receiving during his tenure there the Justice Tom C. Clark Award. He has served as the U.S. member of UNESCO's World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST), of which he remains a corresponding member. He is a member of the boards of the Ethics and Public Policy Center (where he is Vice-Chairman of the Board), the American Enterprise Institute, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the Center for Individual Rights, the Heritage Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, and the Templeton Foundation Religion Trust. George is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. George has served or serves on the editorial boards of the American Journal of Jurisprudence, the Journal of American Political Thought, National Affairs, Touchstone and the editorial advisory board of First Things. Political activity President George W. Bush after receiving the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2008 George twice served as Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Youth Conference, and attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention as an alternate delegate. He moved to the right in the 1980s, largely due to his views on abortion, and left the Democratic Party as a result of what he saw as its increasingly strong commitment to legal abortion and its public funding, and his growing skepticism about the effectiveness of large scale government-run social welfare projects in Appalachia and other low income rural and urban areas. George founded the American Principles Project, which aims to create a grass- roots movement around his ideas. He is a past chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, an advocacy group opposed to same-sex marriage, and co-founder of the Renewal Forum, an organization fighting the sexual trafficking and commercial exploitation of women and children. George drafted the Manhattan Declaration, a manifesto signed by Orthodox, Catholic and Evangelical leaders that \\"promised resistance to the point of civil disobedience against any legislation that might implicate their churches or charities in abortion, embryo-destructive research or same-sex marriage.\\" He has also joined with Muslim scholar Shaykh Hamza Yusuf in urging hotel chains and other businesses to refrain from offering or promoting pornography. He has worked closely with his former student Rabbi Meir Soloveichik and with Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks of Great Britain to combat anti-Semitism in Europe. Along with other public intellectuals, George played a key role in creating the \\"theoconservative\\" movement and integrating it into mainstream Republicanism.Sullivan, Andrew. The Conservative Soul: How We Lost It, How to Get It Back. New York: HarperCollins, 2006; . Much of George's work on religious liberty has centered on the idea that religion is a \\"distinct human good\\", which he asserts allows people to \\"live authentically by ordering one's life in line with one's best judgments of conscience.\\" George was threatened with death by abortion rights extremist Theodore Shulman, who also targeted Priests for Life director Rev. Frank Pavone, saying that they would be killed if the accused killer of Dr. George Tiller (a Wichita abortion-provider) was acquitted. For his crimes, Shulman was sentenced by Federal Judge Paul A. Crotty to 41 months' imprisonment and 3 years' supervised release.https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pro-choice-terrorist- sentenced-for-death-threats-against-pro-lifers George endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. In his own words, he \\"fiercely opposed\\" the candidacy of Donald Trump, saying that he was \\"a person of poor character.\\" In July 2017, after Trump had become president, George praised his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. However, he characterized his attempts to restrict immigration to the United States from certain countries as \\"unnecessary and therefore unjust.\\" He went on to say, \\"One thing you have to say for President Trump is that he has been fortunate in his enemies. Although he gives them plenty to legitimately criticize him about, they always go overboard and thus discredit themselves with the very people who elected Mr. Trump and may well re-elect him.\\" Honors On December 8, 2008, George was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George W. Bush in a ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House. His other awards include the Honorific Medal for the Defense of Human Rights of the Republic of Poland, the Canterbury Medal of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the Philip Merrill Award of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, the Irving Kristol Award of the American Enterprise Institute, the Sidney Hook Award of the National Association of Scholars, the Paul Bator Award of the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy, and Princeton University's President's Award for Distinguished Teaching. He holds nineteen honorary degrees, including a Doctor Honoris Causa awarded by the Universitat Abat Oliba CEU University in Barcelona, Spain in 2017. Also in 2017, Baylor University launched the \\"Robert P. George Initiative in Faith, Ethics, and Public Policy,\\" as part of its Baylor in Washington, D.C. program. Reception George has been called the \\"most influential conservative Christian thinker\\" in the United States by David Kirkpatrick of the New York Times. Kirkpatrick goes on to state: Supreme Court Justice and former Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan has praised George as \\"one of the nation's most respected legal theorists,\\" saying that the respect he had gained was due to \\"his sheer brilliance, the analytic power of his arguments, the range of his knowledge,\\" and \\"a deeply principled conviction, a profound and enduring integrity.\\" In announcing his election as Chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in 2013, outgoing Chairwoman Katrina Lantos Swett, a Democrat appointed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, praised George as \\"a true human rights champion whose compassion for victims of oppression and wisdom about international religious freedom shine through all we have accomplished.\\" George was described by The New Yorker in 2014 as \\"a widely respected conservative legal philosopher\\" who has \\"played [intellectual] godfather to right-leaning students on [the Princeton] campus.\\" George's critics, including many Catholic scholars, have argued that he has neglected critical aspects of the Christian message, including \\"the corruption of human reason through original sin, the need for forgiveness and charity and the chance for redemption,\\" focusing instead on \\"mechanics\\" of morality, and – through his political associations and activism – turned the church \\"into a tool of Republican Party.\\" Musical activity George is a finger style guitarist and bluegrass banjo player. His guitar playing is in the style of Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed. His banjo playing mixes the styles of Earl Scruggs, Don Reno, and Bela Fleck. As a teenager, he performed with folk groups and bluegrass bands in coffee houses, rod and gun clubs, and at state and county fairs in West Virginia, Maryland, and Virginia. At Swarthmore he led \\"Robby George and Friends\\", a country and bluegrass band. He has performed with folk singer Ed Trickett, country music pioneer Stan Hitchcock, and the New Jersey-based bluegrass band \\"Blue Heart\\".http://www.blueheartband.com Works =Books= * Natural Law Theory: Contemporary Essays, 1992. * Making Men Moral, 1995. * Natural Law and Moral Inquiry: Ethics, Metaphysics, and Politics in the Work of Germain Grisez, 1998. * In Defense of Natural Law, 1999. * The Autonomy of Law: Essays on Legal Positivism, 1999. * Natural Law and Public Reason, 2000. * Great Cases in Constitutional Law, 2000. * The Clash of Orthodoxies, 2001. * Natural Law, Liberalism, and Morality, 2001. * Constitutional Politics: Essays on Constitution Making, Maintenance, and Change, 2001 * The Meaning of Marriage: Family, State, Market, And Morals, 2006 * Body-Self Dualism in Contemporary Ethics and Politics, 2007 * Embryo: A Defense of Human Life, 2008 * Moral Pública: Debates Actuales, 2009 * What Is Marriage?

It is the fifth longest state route in Ohio. Its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 42 in Cincinnati, Ohio, and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 6 in Sandusky, Ohio. Its path is nearly ruler-straight for many miles. Some portions of the route are still marked as Dixie Highway. The northern portion was constructed by the Columbus and Sandusky Turnpike Company, see Turnpike Lands. Route description State Route 4 begins in Cincinnati, running through Middletown as well as Dayton, then joining Interstate 70, with which it runs concurrently for over three miles. The route then goes through Springfield and continues to Marion. It then travels to Bucyrus, finally heading northeast to Sandusky, where it ends. The portion of SR 4 between High Street (SR 129) and North Fair Avenue in Hamilton is designated as the \\"Firefighter/Paramedic Patrick Wolterman Memorial Highway\\", in honor of a firefighter/paramedic for that city who died December 28, 2015, while battling an intentionally-set house fire. The two men who started the blaze were convicted of murder and arson in November 2017 and sentenced to life in prison. This portion of SR 4 passes by Wolterman's fire station. History *1912 – Route ran from Sandusky to Columbus *1924 – Route extended south from Columbus on former SH 5, following current US 23 alignment from Portsmouth to Waldo, and current SR 423 from Waldo to Marion.Route 4 (The Unofficial Ohio State Highways Web Site) by John Simpson *1926 – Alignment from Portsmouth to Marion certified as US 23; SR 4 realigned south of Marion to its current southern terminus in Cincinnati, replacing the former SR 6 from Cincinnati to Middletown, the former SR 52 from Middletown to south of Milford Center, and the former SR 38 from Marysville to Marion. *1959 – Alignment from Dayton to Springfield rerouted and upgraded to freeway; segment through Fairborn around Wright-Patterson Air Force Base designated as SR 444. *1967 – Segment from SR 201 to SR 444 upgraded to freeway. *2011 – Dayton segment is rerouted via I-75 Future =Huber Heights safety improvements= The intersection of SR 4 and New Carlisle Pike/Lower Valley Pike in Huber Heights, between SR 235/Chambersburg Road and Interstate 70, has had at least 15 accidents between 2012 and August 2018, resulting in three fatalities and 20 injuries. The intersection, which is uncontrolled, is along a high-speed portion of SR 4 that is near-expressway in character; additionally, the median is not wide enough to allow longer vehicles such as tractor-trailers to wait there safely before making a left turn (north) from New Carlisle Pike onto SR 4\\\\. Fixes for the problem intersection, all rejected, included adding lights and signage; closing the intersection; adding a traffic light; constructing a roundabout; adding an overpass; requiring traffic from New Carlisle Pike to northbound SR 4 to instead travel southbound to the SR 235/Chambersburg Road interchange, exit and re-enter northbound; and rerouting New Carlisle Pike to Chambersburg Road. At the August 6, 2018 Huber Heights city council meeting, an engineering firm hired by the city, working in conjunction with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), proposed two alternatives. The first, a restricted crossing U-turn (RCUT) (also known as a superstreet), would prohibit left turns from New Carlisle Pike or Lower Valley Pike, and cross- traffic between the two; those movements would be accomplished via right turns onto SR 4, followed by designated median U-turns. Left turns from SR 4 to New Carlisle Pike and Lower Valley Pike would still be permitted. This alternative has an estimated cost of $1 million, with ODOT paying 80% of the cost and the city paying 20%. The second alternative, sometimes called a \\"basic RCUT\\", is similar to the first alternative, but would additionally prohibit left turns from SR 4 to New Carlisle Pike and Lower Valley Pike; those movements would be accomplished via median U-turns, followed by right turns. This alternative's estimated cost is $701,000, using the same 80%/20% cost split. A superstreet already exists along the SR 4 Bypass in nearby Butler County. Major intersections State Route 4 Bypass Map of SR 4 By-Pass State Route 4 By- Pass (SR 4B or SR 4 Bypass, known locally as Bypass 4) is a north–south state highway through Butler County in the western part of the state. The route runs from SR 4 in Fairfield to SR 4 in Fairfield Township north of the Hamilton city limits. SR 4B begins at a quadrant roadway intersection with SR 4 (Dixie Highway) and Ross Road in eastern Fairfield. Here, the connector road is located in the northwest quadrant of the intersection. The route travels north as a divided four-lane road first crossing over a CSX railroad and intersecting Port Union Road. The next three intersections SR 4B has (from south to north: Symmes Road, Tylersville Road, and Hamilton–Mason Road) are superstreet intersections. The roadway briefly expands to three lanes in each direction between Symmes Road and Tylersville Road as it crosses over a Norfolk Southern railroad. This segment also features the Fairfield-Hamilton city boundary. After the Hamilton–Mason Road intersection, SR 4B comes to a diamond interchange with SR 129 (Butler County Veterans Highway). North of Princeton Road, the route shrinks to an undivided two-lane road, passes under an overpass carrying Milliken Road, and ends at a signalized intersection with SR 4. The entirety of SR 4B is included as a part of the National Highway System. SR 4B was constructed in the early 1970s by ODOT to allow for easier travel between Cincinnati and Middletown. In the 1990s, the Butler County Transportation Improvement District (BCTID) was formed to help address traffic congestion along the fully two-lane bypass route. Construction started on the widening of SR 4B in 2010 which included the widening of the road from the southern terminus to SR 129, the widening of three bridges, and the creation of three superstreet and one quadrant roadway intersections. The superstreet intersections were completed in 2011. Construction of the expanded roadway finished in August 2012 on time and on budget, at a cost of $22.8 million. The BCTID is continuing to study the option of widening SR 4B north of SR 129. SR 4B is the first superstreet corridor in Ohio. As of April 2013, it was reported that the majority of motorists in the area did not approve of the new design, with some avoiding SR 4B entirely. =Major junctions= References 004 ","title":"Ohio State Route 4"},{"id":"2610356","text":"Whispers was one of the new horror and fantasy fiction magazines of the 1970s. History Named after a fictitious magazine referenced in the H. P. Lovecraft story \\"The Unnamable\\", Whispers began as an attempt by editor and publisher Stuart David Schiff to produce a modest semi-professional little magazine that hoped to revive the legendary Weird Tales in a small way. The magazine was also a followup to August Derleth's The Arkham Collector, which had ceased after Derleth's death. Whispers was first published in July 1973. It went on to become a more elaborate showcase for dark fantasy fiction and artwork of the 1970s. Schiff's early influences included the story of Aladdin, the Gorgon and the Cyclops, Edgar Allan Poe, Weird Tales and Lee Brown Coye. He subsequently became an avid collector of horror books and materials.Gahan Wilson, ed. First World Fantasy Awards. NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 258. Among the fiction writers featured in the magazine were Manly Wade Wellman, Fritz Leiber, Robert Bloch, Ramsey Campbell, and Karl Edward Wagner. David Drake published much of his early fantasy fiction there. Among the artists to contribute were Stephen Fabian, Lee Brown Coye, Vincent Napoli, and many others, both legends in their own right and younger stars. The magazine won the first \\"Howard\\" or World Fantasy Award for non-professional publishing in 1975, though it was clearly on a professional level in editorial content and production. When Schiff and his wife had their first child, Geoffrey Ashton Schiff, Schiff brought out a special edition of Whispers devoted to the them of monstrous and ghastly babies.Gahan Wilson, ed. First World Fantasy Awards. NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 258. It ended publication in October 1987 with the issues 23 and 24. Beginning in 1978, an anthology series, drawing on work published in the magazine and mixing some new material, was published in hardcover by Doubleday and then in paperback by Playboy Press, soon after absorbed by Berkley/Putnam, which began a trend of parallel publication of increasingly infrequent issues of the magazine and a string of anthologies with an ever-larger proportion of original fiction. A total of six anthologies were published through 1987, and later a \\"Best of\\" volume was published in 1994. Whispers Press Schiff also launched a book-publishing arm, Whispers Press, in the latter 1970s, which produced illustrated volumes. The first Whispers Press volume was A Winter Wish, a volume of uncollected poetry by H.P. Lovecraft, edited by Tom Collins. Collins' edition was roundly criticised by S.T. Joshi for its being riddled with typographical errors. Shortly thereafter, Whispers Press issued the short novel Rime Isle by Fritz Leiber. Several other publications were issued, most in both trade and signed/numbered/slipcased editions (including Robert Bloch's Cthulhu Mythos novel Strange Eons), all showing an appreciation of fine bookmaking and quality workmanship. After a sampling from Whispers was published in the Gahan Wilson-edited First World Fantasy Awards volume, Schiff and Fritz Leiber co- edited the Second World Fantasy Awards volume for Doubleday.

It is known as Actone in the Domesday Book. Located around 4 miles southeast of Stafford, it is an affluent village, with many large homes but few local amenities (except for a Post Office which opens Tuesdays and Thursdays). Residents in this village have excellent views of Staffordshire farmland and Stafford Castle in the distance. Its close proximity to the M6 motorway (Junction 13) makes it a very convenient location for commuters. The majority of commuting from the village takes place to the areas of southern Staffordshire, eastern Shropshire and the West Midlands conurbation.Travel to Work Areas from the 2001 Census Etymology The name 'Acton' is derived from the Anglo-Saxon Āctūn meaning oak (āc) + town (tūn); the Trussells were a Norman family who were early lords of the manor. St James church St James' Church, Acton Trussell, May 2008 The village church dedicated to St James was originally built in 1212.Acton Trussel, Bednall, Coppenhall and Dunston - Diocese of Lichfield It was then enlarged and rebuilt in 1869 under the direction of G E Street, the architect being Andrew Capper. The main additions were a combined vestry and organ chamber on the north side and a new south porch.L. Margaret Midgley (editor), A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 5 - East Cuttlestone Hundred, Victoria County History, UK, 1959, pp.14-15 The church was re-opened after restoration in 1870 having been closed for 44 years. The Moat House The Moat House, Acton Trussell, May 2008 The village has one very large pub and hotel 'The Moat House' not to be confused with 'The Moat House Group'. The Moat House in Acton Trussell is owned independently by the Lewis family. The pub section of the hotel was the original farm house built on the property.  Roman Villa  In May 1985 the semi hexagonal wing of a Roman villa was discovered in the Churchyard.Acton Trussell Roman Villa The wing of a Roman villa was discovered in 1985 outside the east boundary of the churchyard; excavations have been ongoing since then, carried out by Penk Valley Archaeological Group. The work has shown that occupation of the site dates back to at least the Neolithic period (late Stone Age), with finds from the Bronze Age and Iron Age proving continuing occupation up to and including the Romano-British period. The wing is a 2nd- century addition to a rectangular building in the churchyard; by the 4th century further additions had been made, and the now old 2nd-century villa, including the wing, was rebuilt. There are extensive ditched enclosures of the 1st and late 2nd centuries, replaced with a walled enclosure in the 4th century when the villa was extended. The size of the final build stretches from the wing, just outside the east boundary, westward to the tower, and is at least 43 metres. This was proved by a watching brief carried out in 2010 during pipework installation for toilet and tea-making facilities in the church.

Tent and Geraghty (2001) comment that the origin of the Western Polynesian Papāalagi~Pālagi and the Fijian Vāvālagi~Pāpālagi remains a matter of speculation.Tent, Jan and Paul Geraghty, Paul, 2001, \\"Exploding sky or exploded myth? The origin of Papalagi\\", Journal of the Polynesian Society, 110, No. 2: 171-214. Papāalagi~Pālagi is a word in the Samoan language describing non-Samoans especially European westerners or Caucasians. In Samoa the term is used to describe foreigners. The word is both a noun e.g. a Palagi (European person) or an adjective e.g. Palagi house (non-traditional Samoan house). The word is a cognate in other Polynesian languages and has gained widespread use throughout much of western Polynesia, including in Tokelau, Tuvalu, 'Uvea and Futuna. Written Pālagi or Papālagi in Samoan, and Papālangi or Pālangi in Tongan,Tcherkezoff, Serge, 1999. \\"Who said the 17th-18th centuries paplagi/'Europeans' were 'sky-bursters'? A Eurocentric projection onto Polynesia\\", Journal of the Polynesian Society, 108, 4: 417-425. the term Pālagi is also used in Niuean. Use, meaning and origin of term The etymology of the term Palagi is disputed. An explanation that emerged in the 19th century is that word is derived from the Polynesian rootwords \\"pa\\" (meaning: gates) and \\"lagi\\" (meaning: sky or heaven), hence the standard translation \\"gates of heaven\\"Stair, John B., n.d. [c. 1897]. Old Samoa or Flotsam and Jetsam from the Pacific Ocean, Oxford: The Religious Tract Society. It has been suggested that the compound word comes from the Polynesian's reaction to seeing for the first time, European missionaries enter the country. Their skin being a different color made them think they were men sent from the gates of heaven.Turner, George, 1884. Samoa: A Hundred Years Ago and Long Before, London: Macmillan. Tcherkézoff (1999) argues that such an interpretation is a European projection to explain Polynesian cosmology. The explanation of Niuean word \\"Palagi\\", is that \\"pa\\" means bang such as that of a gun and \\"lagi\\" means sky, literally means bangs into the sky. In \\"Papa-lagi\\" \\"papa\\" means more than one bang or many bangs, and \\"lagi\\" means sky. In the olden days, Europeans who landed on Niue carried guns and often fired the guns into the sky, when they landed on the reef, to scare away potential trouble-making natives. Jan Tent, a Macquarie University linguist, and Dr. Paul Geraghty, director of the Institute of Fijian Language and Culture in Suva, suggest that the word may have its origins in the travels of the Polynesians themselves. They believe that the Polynesian islanders may have encountered Malay travellers prior to contact with Europeans, and adopted the Malay word barang (meaning: imported cloth). These researchers also suggest another possible etymology - the Malay word for European, as used in the 17th and 18th centuries, was faranggi. However, they discount this possibility as the word palangi seems to have originally referred to cloth; only later was the word transferred to the people. A possible alternative etymology for palangi is that is it derived from the Perso-Arabic term farangi, meaning \\"an outsider\\". The extent to which Arab traders explored the Pacific Islands, or that Pacific Island communities had contact with Muslim trades remains uncertain but Arab and Persian Muslim colonies were established in Indonesia and Malaysia starting around the 10th century AD. According to an unpublished paper by Prof. Bivar of the School of Oriental and African Studies, there is some textual evidence from Arab and Persian travelogues (cf. The Journeys of Sinbad in the One Thousand and One Nights) for contact between Muslim traders and Pacific islands prior to European discoveries and landfalls.  Recorded use Captain Cook noted the expression \\"ko e vaka no papalangi\\" (the boats of Papalangi) in Tonga, with Cook's transcription being \\"Towacka no papalangie\\" and his translation as \\"cloth ships\\".Beaglehole, J.C., 1961. The Journals of Captain James Cook on His Voyages of Discovery, vol.3. The Voyage of the Resolution and the Discovery 1776-1780. Cambridge p. 178. The specific origin of this term remains uncertain. The term has gained widespread use throughout much of western Polynesia including Tokelau, Tuvalu, 'Uvea and Futuna, etc., with the expansion of use of the term being though to have occurred in the 18th century when Tongans, and to lesser extent Samoans, regularly interacted with white sailors, beachcombers, convicts, missionaries, and whalers who clearly delineated ethnoracial boundaries between themselves (papalagi/papalangi) and the Polynesians they encountered. The missionary John Williams, of the London Missionary Society, records a speech in Samoa, in 1830, referring to the great powers of the \\"papalangis\\".Williams, John, 1841.

Modern usage Largely because of the growing Pacific Islander culture in New Zealand, this word has been adopted by other Pacific cultures. Its usage in New Zealand's Pacific Islander media such as television and radio is common, and it is often used by the mainstream media to describe non-Samoans of European descent. The term is now also used in New Zealand in a similar way to the Māori term Pākehā, but it is not restricted in referring to white people within Pacific- island surroundings. As with Pākehā, Samoans and Tongans initially applied palagi/palangi and papalagi/papalangi to whites of British derivation. Today, the Samoan term \\"gagana fa'a Palagi\\", the Tongan term \\"lea fakapālangi\\" and the Tuvaluan term \\"faka-Pālagi\\" still refer to the English language specifically, even though it is understood that many ethnic Europeans who are considered \\"palagi\\" do not speak English but rather German, French, Spanish, etc. While the term is generally applied to people of European ancestry as a means of differentiation or categorization, some feel the term is derogatory, especially when aimed pointedly toward half-caste Samoans or ethnic Samoans who were born and raised in western, metropolitan societies; \\"fia palagi\\" and \\"fie palangi\\" are commonly applied to ethnic Samoans and Tongans, respectively, who are viewed as favoring the \\"white man's\\" lifestyle or culture in lieu of traditional Polynesian modes of speech, dress, housing, interpersonal relations, etc. Tcherkezoff (1999) comments,\\"Europeans are still called Papālagi in today's languages. In Samoan, it is an absolutely common everyday word, not in any way a metaphoric ceremonial expression used for special circumstances or used in [purely] derogatory/laudatory ways.\\" See also * Haole, the equivalent Hawaiian term * Pākehā, the equivalent term in the Māori language References External links * Lingua Franca: Tent and Geraghty's research into Papalangi Further reading    Category:Ethno-cultural designations Category:New Zealand society Category:Samoan words and phrases Category:Tongan society Category:White Oceanian ","title":"Palagi"},{"id":"2610366","text":"Floyd Kirk Haskell (February 7, 1916August 25, 1998) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Senator from Colorado from 1973 to 1979. Early life and career Floyd Haskell was born in Morristown, New Jersey, to Edward Kirk and Gladys (née Clarkson) Haskell. His father was an investment banker. He attended Harvard University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1937. During college, he played on the football, rugby, and soccer teams and was president of the Rocky Mountain Club. He received a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1941. That same year he married Eileen Nicoll, to whom he remained married until their divorce in 1976; they had three daughters, Ione, Evelyn, and Pamela. During World War II, Haskell served in the U.S. Army from 1941 to 1945, seeing action in Asia and reaching the rank of major. He was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for his intelligence work. Following his military service, he was admitted to the bar in 1946 and moved to Denver, Colorado, where he worked as a tax lawyer. In 1964, Haskell was elected as a Republican to the Colorado House of Representatives from Arapahoe County, serving until 1969. As a state legislator, he became assistant majority leader in 1967 and also served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a member of the House Education and Finance Committees. In 1970, he left the Republican Party and became a Democrat in protest of President Richard Nixon's invasion of Cambodia. U.S. Senate In 1972, Haskell decided to challenge three-term Republican incumbent Gordon L. Allott for a seat in the U.S. Senate. He defeated state Senator Anthony Vollack (later chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court) in the Democratic primary. In the general election, he narrowly won457,545 a four-way race between Allott447,957 and candidates from the Raza Unida Party13,228 and the American Independent Party,7,353 receiving only 49% of the vote. He defeated his closest competitor, Senator Allott, by less than 10,000 votes while President Nixon carried Colorado by over 267,000 votes. Haskell was sworn into the Senate on January 3, 1973. He served as a member of the Senate Finance and Energy and Natural Resources Committees, where he earned a reputation as a tax reformer and advocate for the environment. He supported the regulation of auto emissions, the Panama Canal treaties, and alternative sources of energy. In 1978, he was defeated for re-election by Representative and future Colorado Christian University president William L. Armstrong, losing by a margin of 59%-40%. Later life and death After his Senate career, Haskell established his residence in Washington, D.C., where he practiced law before joining Common Cause and a bipartisan group of retired lawmakers calling for campaign finance reform and an end to congressional gridlock. In 1979, he married Nina Totenberg, the legal affairs correspondent for National Public Radio; they remained married until his death in 1998. Haskell suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in 1994 after falling on ice near his home in Washington. He died of pneumonia four years later, at age 82, while returning from a vacation in Maine with his wife.

The southern terminus of SR 300 is at a T-intersection with U.S. Route 6 (US 6) approximately west of the village of Helena. Its northern terminus is at US 20 just over southeast of Woodville. SR 300 is a two-lane highway that provides access to the village of Gibsonburg from both US 6 and US 20\\\\. When first designated in the early 1930s, SR 300 only connected US 20 to Gibsonburg. Later in that decade, it would be extended south to link the village with US 6\\\\. Route description SR 300 lies entirely within the western portion of Sandusky County. Commencing at a T-intersection with US 6 on the boundary between Scott Township and Madison Township west of Helena, SR 300 heads due north through a landscape that is primarily farmland. Some patches of trees and a few homes also appear along this stretch of the highway. North of where it intersects County Road 55 (CR 55), the state highway is bounded on the east side by woods for a distance, up to its intersection with CR 65\\\\. Continuing north, SR 300 enters into Gibsonburg as it passes by Gibsonburg High School along Main Street, which the highway follows through the village. SR 300 passes through a primarily residential portion of Gibsonburg as it crosses the CSX railway line, with side streets meeting the highway along the way. The state highway enters the central business district upon crossing Yeasting Street. One block north of there, SR 300 meets SR 600 at Gibsonburg's only signalized intersection. One block north of there, after Stevenson Street, SR 300 re-enters residential territory. The highway passes a few commercial businesses on the outskirts of the village, and upon crossing CR 79, the route re-enters rural Madison Township, bounded by a large pond and trees to the west and some homes to the east. After crossing CR 85, SR 300 enters a vastness of farmland, as it passes into Woodville Township. Upon crossing into the township, the route travels amidst a primarily forested terrain as it passes its intersection with CR 115, and then arrives at its endpoint at the four-lane divided US 20 southeast of Woodville. Continuing north of US 20 after SR 300 ends is CR 56. Frequently, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) conducts surveys throughout its highway system to determine the volume of traffic utilizing it. This is done using a metric called the average annual daily traffic (AADT). The AADT identifies the amount of traffic using a given stretch of roadway on any typical day of the year. According to a 2009 survey, ODOT determined that the portion of SR 300 with the highest traffic volume was the stretch between CR 65 south of the Gibsonburg village limits and SR 600 in downtown Gibsonburg, which saw an average of 2,740 passenger vehicles and 90 commercial vehicles on a daily basis. This same report identified the segment of SR 300 between its southern terminus at US 6 and its intersection with CR 65 as having the lightest volume of traffic, with an AADT of 1,340 passenger vehicles and 40 commercial vehicles. No portion of SR 300 is included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a system of routes deemed to be most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. History SR 300 was designated in 1932. Originally, the state highway was a paved spur route connecting US 20 with Gibsonburg. By 1937, SR 300 was extended south from Gibsonburg to its current endpoint at US 6\\\\. The entirely of this stretch of roadway was paved upon being brought into the state highway system.

Biography James Pearson was born in 1920 in Nashville, Tennessee, the son of a Methodist minister. With his parents, he moved to Virginia in 1934 and attended public school. He went on to attend college at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. During the Second World War he interrupted his schooling to serve as a pilot in the air transport service of the United States Navy, flying DC3's across country (1943-1946), and was discharged as a lieutenant. Pearson's legislative accomplishments included the \\"National Weather Modification Policy Act,\\" which authorizes a member of the cabinet to \\"negotiate an International agreement concerning the peaceful uses of weather modification.\\" It was written into public law October 13, 1976. Stationed at the Olathe Naval Air Station in Kansas, Pearson met and married the former Martha Mitchell. Pearson graduated from the law school of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville in 1950. He was admitted to the bar and commenced the practice of law in Mission, Kansas. Pearson served as Assistant County Attorney of Johnson County, Kansas from 1952 to 1954; County Probate Judge from 1954 to 1956; and was elected to the State Senate, where he served from 1956 to 1960. He did not seek reelection but returned to the practice of law. Pearson campaigned with Attorney General John Anderson for governor in 1960. Anderson was elected and Pearson became the state GOP chairman. On January 31, 1962, Anderson appointed Pearson to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Andrew F. Schoeppel. Pearson was elected on November 6, 1962, in a special election for the term ending January 3, 1967; reelected in 1966 for a full six-year term; and reelected again in 1972. Pearson initially voted regularly with the leadership of his party, opposing Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society programs. However Pearson moderated his positions with time. Following the Kent State massacre in 1970, Pearson shifted his position to oppose the bombing of Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam War. In the Senate he became known for working with colleagues across the political aisle. When a group of senators led by Walter Mondale of Minnesota set out to change the filibuster rule, which had been used to block civil rights legislation, they asked Pearson to join them. Together they reduced the number of votes required to end debate from 67 to 60. Pearson voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pearson's other legislative accomplishments came as a member of the Commerce Committee, where he was the ranking minority member of its aviation subcommittee. Those successes included the creation of the airport/airways trust fund, which allowed for the expansion of the nation's airports and air traffic system, and the deregulation of \\"new\\" natural gas, which brought increased production of that clean-burning fuel. Pearson collaborated with Senator Howard Cannon, D-Nevada, and others, on the former legislation and Senators Russell Long, D-Louisiana, and Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, on the latter. Pearson and Democrat Fred Harris of Oklahoma introduced the first major legislation with economic incentives for rural development. With Democrat Phil Hart of Michigan, Pearson sponsored the first major campaign reform legislation following World War II. Pearson was an early supporter of consumer protection legislation. Pearson was a member of the Wednesday Club, a group of moderate and liberal Republican senators who met for lunch to discuss issues. He opposed President Richard Nixon on several Cold War issues, but voted with the president on the Safeguard anti-missile program, which narrowly passed the Senate. The president and his national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, took that program to Moscow and negotiated the abolition of such systems. Back in Kansas, Pearson was considered by some conservatives as not \\"Republican enough.\\" He dealt with this criticism by providing strong constituent service and championing Kansas interests, especially the aviation, oil and gas, and cattle industries. Pearson braved this criticism by introducing his University of Virginia Law School classmate, Robert F. Kennedy, at the University of Kansas and Kansas State University just days after Kennedy had announced he would run for president. On the podium, smiling, Pearson wished Kennedy a long, successful career in the Senate. Following his reelection in 1972, Pearson was appointed by Nixon as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. He retired from the Senate in 1978 and was again named by the Senate to the U. N. delegation. Pearson was succeeded by Nancy Landon Kassebaum Baker. After retiring from the Senate, Pearson and his second wife, the former Margaret Lynch, traveled frequently to Japan and Southeast Asia. Pearson served as a member of the Board of Governors of the East-West Center based in Honolulu, Hawaii, from 1983 to 1991. He and former Senator Ribicoff were selected by the Senate to co-chair a commission to study the structure and procedures of the Senate. After leaving the Senate Pearson had a relationship with the Washington, D. C. office of the law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Lieby and MacRae. A fellowship program named for Pearson allows foreign service officers to work temporarily in other branches of government, including state and local, to learn more about domestic politics. In Kansas, a Pearson Fellowship helps graduates of public universities study abroad. The U.S. Post Office in Prairie Village, Pearson's home town, was named the James B. Pearson Post Office in 2004. Pearson's children include three sons, James, William, and Thomas, and a daughter, Laura. Pearson served from January 31, 1962 until his resignation on December 23, 1978. He was not a candidate for re-election in 1978. Pearson died on January 13, 2009 at his home in Gloucester, Massachusetts at the age of 88. As of 2016, Pearson is the last U.S. Senator from Kansas from the Kansas City metropolitan area, even though Johnson County has the state's largest population.

The neighborhood acquired its name during the second half of the 19th century, when the area was the site of butcher shops and meat packing plants to process pigs transported from the Midwest on the B&O; Railroad; they were herded across Ostend and Cross Streets to be slaughtered and processed. Pigtown's annual festival famously features a pig race, called \\"The Squeakness\\", to commemorate its history. Pigtown has long been considered one of Baltimore's most promising neighborhoods due to its proximity to the I-95 corridor, the University of Maryland Medical Center, Camden Yards, Ravens Stadium, the Inner Harbor, and Downtown Baltimore. New developments on the eastern edge of the neighborhood of luxury townhomes were stalled after the 2008 market crash but eventually resumed and have continued into 2016. Other parts of the neighborhood contain classic Baltimore-style rowhouses, often with 1950s-era formstone facades on brick fronts. Pigtown has a relatively diverse population, which, besides its longtime residents, includes a sizeable graduate student population. Because of its proximity to Interstate 95, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, and its low housing costs, Pigtown also has a great number of commuters to Washington, D.C and Fort George G. Meade. History The area where Pigtown is now located was originally part of the Mount Clare plantation, a 2,368-acre estate owned by Dr. Charles Carroll in the 18th century. Carroll built one of Maryland's first iron foundries on the property, which operated the largest pig iron furnace in the colonies prior to the American Revolution. Dr. Carroll was a cousin of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who signed the Declaration of Independence. In 1827, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was founded in Baltimore. Ground was broken on the Mount Clare property in 1828, with the first stone laid by Charles Carroll of Carrollton, at the age of 90. Initially providing service between Baltimore and Ellicott Mills (now Ellicott City, Maryland), the railroad began operating along West Pratt Street on May 22, 1830. The horsedrawn cars of the early B&O; Railroad were the nation's first regular passenger rail. Construction of the first houses to the north and south of the railroad yards began in 1833. A community of railroad workers grew along Columbia Avenue (now Washington Boulevard) in the 1840s, followed by industrial development in the 1850s and 1860s. Slaughter houses located near the railroad yards earned the area its name as Pigtown as workers herded pigs for slaughter and processing to shops and packing plants across the streets from the rail cars. Although official records have identified the neighborhood as Washington Village at various points since the 1970s, it has been consistently labeled as Pigtown since 2006 at the insistence of community groups such as Southwest Community Council, Inc. Historic landmarks Pigtown has several historic landmarks, including some national landmarks. Patrick's of Pratt Street, which has operated at 934 West Pratt Street for more than 160 years, claims to be \\"America's Oldest Irish Pub\\". The Bayard Station valve house at 1415 Bayard Street, built in 1885 by the Chesapeake Gas Company to distribute coal gas in Baltimore, now serves as home to Housewerks, an architectural salvage store. Pigtown is also home to the historic B&O; Railroad Museum, which houses exhibits of historic significance to American railroading and items specific to the Pigtown community. Mount Clare Mansion, a brick Georgian plantation house built in 1763, is the oldest remaining Colonial-era structure in Baltimore. It was purchased by the city government in 1890, along with 70 acres of land, for use as a park. Located at 1500 Washington Boulevard, the former home of Dr. Charles Carroll has been maintained as a museum by the Maryland chapter of The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America since 1917. Culture The blue collar culture of Pigtown began with the individuals who worked on the B&O; Railroad and German immigrants who opened butcher shops in the neighborhood. Community organizations have emphasized the importance of the neighborhood's history and blue collar origin as they rebuffed attempts to rename it Washington Village. Pigtown celebrates its culture yearly during the Pigtown Festival, which features local food, entertainment and \\"\\", a race featuring pigs. The pig race pays homage to the neighborhood's beginning with the railroad, railroad workers and German butchers. Many white residents of Pigtown are out-migrants or descendants of out-migrants from Appalachia, particularly West Virginia and Western Maryland. Poor white Appalachian residents of Pigtown report discrimination from the police on the basis of class. Some poor white residents of Pigtown allege that while poor black people in Pigtown and the nearby neighborhood of Sandtown experience more discrimination due to the combination of racism and classism, poor whites nonetheless experience targeting and harassment from the police. According to David Simon, a police reporter from the Baltimore Sun, a nickname for Pigtown among police officers is \\"Billyland\\", derived from the term hillbilly, a derogatory term for poor white Appalachians. =Horseshoe pit= Since the 1970s, an empty lot at the corner of Ward and Bayard Streets has served as the community horseshoe pit. Its significance in the community is commemorated by a mural, painted on a building beside the lot, about 15 years after the first horseshoe stakes were planted there. In 2007, the 12-by-60 foot area was sold by the city government to a developer. It was repurchased by the city in 2010, and is now preserved and maintained as the community horseshoe pit by Baltimore Green Space, a local nonprofit organization. The first Annual Horseshoe Tournament at the Pit In Pigtown was held in 2011. =Tailgating Parties= Another empty lot, this time on the corners of Ostend and Wicomico streets serves as the location of tailgate parties before Ravens football games. The lot has an area of 35,718 square feet and can hold around twenty trucks and tents during those tailgating parties.

S. Cardone and starring Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton and Chloë Grace Moretz. The film was claimed to be based on true events. Plot In 1913, in Carlton, Pennsylvania (shot in Bulgaria), the cruel owner of the Carlton mine exploits poor immigrant children. In order to excavate a new shaft quickly, he employs a dynamite charge, but the explosion causes the mine to collapse, burying a large group of the children alive. Following his later trial for wilfully causing the death of his workers, Carlton is acquitted and the mine closed down. In present day, eighty years later, Karen Tunny has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease and has inherited his birthhome near the since-abandoned Carlton mine. She moves to the house with her daughters, Sarah and Emma. The three stop by the local market for supplies and are told by Walter, the shopkeeper, that he doesn't deliver to the area they live in. While driving, Karen has a near miss with a man crossing the road. She exits the car, looking for the man, but he's nowhere to be found. They arrive at the house and Sarah points out the blood on the door while Karen declares it's just \\"paint.\\" When Emma hears children giggling, she leaves the house, following the sound of it. Karen goes out looking for Emma and finds her in an old mine. As they try to find their way back to the house, it becomes nightfall and they get lost. They find a house, which is occupied by Hanks, and enter. Karen is advised by Hanks to stay at home during the night, and he also tells her that there is no need to thank him for the blood smeared on his and the Tunny's door. William Carlton, the last surviving heir of the Carlton estate, which has owned the mine since 1913, is hungrily devouring property and kicking people off his own property. Meanwhile, the zombie children begin to kill, which is dismissed among the community as disappearances, though it is hinted that most of the community is aware of the presence of the children. As it turns out, the Tunny and Hanks families are relatives of the zombie children who happen to leave blood relatives alive while killing all others. Emma, who has had friendly contact with a less-violent zombie named Mary, informs her mother that the zombies won't eat her, and that Mary would not directly hurt her mother (who is not a direct Tunny blood relative), but passes on the warning that the other children might. Karen finds some old family photo albums in the basement that contain pictures of her late husband, as well as the Tunny and Hanks children who died in the mine disaster, thus revealing that the family is related to some of the children who died in the mine. Karen and Sarah leave the house to go look for Emma. As they exit the mine, not being able to find Emma, they become surrounded by a dozen of the children. They escape, with the children pursuing them, and find a car passing through with Carlton inside. They enter, telling him to drive, but the tires are slashed before they can pull away. Karen and Sarah run to Hanks' house, unsure of what to do. Soon enough, Karen figures out that Hanks' blood has a supposed repellent effect on the zombie children. As both Hanks and Carlton attempt to shoot the children, they realize the bullets are ineffective, and run to the barn. Hanks realizes that, as he and Emma are direct blood relatives, it turns out Mary has an older brother that's also a Tunny, and Karen is in some way protected by Emma's relationship with Mary. The children are really after Carlton, as they blame his family for the mining accident that killed them. After Carlton is killed by the children, Emma remarks that they won't be hurting anyone anymore. At the end, the Tunny family drives away and reveals that the house has not been sold. Now, Mary lives in the house, with the bear that Emma gave her, and a few of the other children as well.

The film follows a woman desperate to reunite with her dead lover. It also follows three other tragic romances, set in a Middle Eastern city; in Venice, Italy; and in the Chinese Empire. Plot In \\"Some Time and Some Place,\\" a loving young couple is riding in a carriage on a country road, when they pick up a hitchhiker, offering him a ride into town. Little do they know, this stranger is Death himself. In town, Death visits the mayor's office, where he purchases a small piece of land adjacent to the town cemetery. Surrounding this property, Death erects a giant, mysterious wall. At the local tavern, the young couple encounters Death again, and when the young woman is distracted, her lover disappears. Grief stricken, she sobs in front of the mysterious wall, when she sees a large group of ghosts walk past her, and through the wall. The last among these ghosts is her lover; and despite her protests, he also moves through the wall, entering the realm of Death. Relentless, the young woman confronts Death, begging him to bring her to her lover. He leads her to a large, dark room, with numerous long candles, each one in different stages of burning. The young woman demands to know why Death took her lover away, to which Death explains that he was simply following God's will, and that it was her lover's time to die. She asks if there is anything that can be done to get her love back, arguing that love is stronger than Death. Death tells her that each candle in the room represents a human life, and that currently, three candles are flickering, representing three lives hanging in the balance. Death promises the young woman that, if she can save one of these lives with love, he will return her lover to the living. = The Story of the First Light = During the holy month of Ramadan in \\"The City of the Faithful,\\" a Muezzin calls those of Islamic faith to prayer. Zobeide, a princess and the Caliph's sister, meets with her secret lover, the Frank, in the mosque. The Frank, however, is exposed as an infidel, and is chased to the roof, where he escapes by diving into a nearby body of water. The Caliph visits Zobeide, attempting to find where her loyalties lie. Although she denies an affair with the Frank, the Caliph is unconvinced, and tells her his guards are scouring the city for him. After he leaves, Zobeide orders her servant, Ayesha, to find the Frank, and tell him to infiltrate the royal palace by nightfall. One of the Caliph's guards tails Ayesha to the Frank, and reports back to his master. At nightfall, the Frank scales the palace wall and reunites with Zobeide; this reunion is cut short by Ayesha warning them that the Caliph is aware of the Frank being in the palace, and has sent his guards. After a short chase through the palace grounds, the guards capture the Frank, and the Caliph sentences him to death. The Caliph orders his gardener, El Mott, to bury the Frank alive. When Zobeide sees what has become of her lover, Death appears to claim him. The first of three candles burns out. = The Story of the Second Light = During the Carnival festival in Venice, Monna Fiametta, a noblewoman, is visited by her lover, Gianfrancesco, a merchant of the middle class. He is forced away by the appearance of Monna's fiancé, Girolamo, a member of the Council of Fourteen. Jealous of Monna's affections for Gianfrancesco, and aware of her hatred towards him, Girolamo reveals to her his plot to have her lover executed by order of the Council. Desperate and angry, Monna plots to kill her fiancé, sending two separate letters by way of messenger. The first letter, addressed to Girolamo, asks him for a private meeting. When Girolamo reads this note delivered by the messenger, he notices he still holds an additional letter. Commanding the messenger to hand it over, he reads the second letter, addressed to Gianfrancesco, alerting him of Girolamo's plot, as well as her plan to kill him. Furious, Girolamo orders the messenger to send his own note, as well as his lavish Carnival costume, to Gianfrancesco, under the guise that it is from Monna. Entering her home in costume, Gianfrancesco is attacked by Monna, who is unaware of his identity. He is also stabbed from behind by the Moor, Monna's servant. Gianfrancesco reveals his identity to Monna, and dies. As Monna grieves over her dead lover, Death appears to claim his soul. The second of three candles burns out. = The Story of the Third Light = On a farm in the Chinese Empire, master magician A Hi receives a letter from the Emperor, requesting him to perform magic tricks at his birthday party. He warns, however, that should A Hi bore him, he will be beheaded. Using his jade wand, A Hi flies a carpet to the Emperor's palace, with his two assistants, Tiao Tsien and Liang, in tow. Performing for the Emperor, A Hi creates a miniature army. The Emperor is impressed, but wants his female assistant, Tiao Tsien as his gift. A Hi deflects, and offers him a magic horse. Again, the Emperor is impressed, but orders A Hi to hand over his assistant. Liang, Tiao Tsien's lover, attempts to escape with her, but is captured, while she is taken to the Emperor's private quarters. When the Emperor tries to sleep with her, she quickly rejects him. Obsessed with having Tiao Tsien's affections, the Emperor turns to A Hi, and orders him to make her submit. When A Hi confronts his assistant, she takes his wand, accidentally cracking it. Using the wand, she turns A Hi into a cactus, and several guards into pigs. She notices that the more she uses the wand, the more it degrades. Spawning an elephant, Tiao Tsien breaks Liang out of his cell, and they escape the palace together. The Emperor calls upon his archer to kill them. When the Emperor's archer confronts the assistants, he kills Liang, but spares Tiao Tsien. Death appears to claim Liang's soul, and the last of the three candles burns out. = Ending = Although Death has won their bet, he takes pity on the female lover, and offers her one last chance to reunite with her beloved. Death tells her that if she can find another soul to replace her lover in death, he will return to the living. He warns that she will only have an hour to do this. Asking many of the older villagers to trade their lives, she is quickly rejected. When a fire starts in a large building, many people rush to escape, leaving behind a baby. The female lover runs into the burning building and holds the baby. Death appears, and is ready to accept the child in place of her lover. However, she looks through the window to see the grieving mother cry for her child. Unwilling to let another experience such a loss, she hands the baby over to the mother. She then turns to Death, and offers her soul to him, content to join her lover in death. Death takes her through his wall, and rejoices, as she reunites with her lover.  Cast   Inspiration  The film was largely inspired by the Indian mythological tale of Sati Savitri as well as the director's own personal experience. According to Lang's biographer, Patrick McGilligan, the film \\"came on the heels of his mother's death, [and] would be the director 's most thoughtful and compassionate meditation on mortality.\\" He goes on to explain that Lang reportedly came up with his vision of Death while suffering from a fever in bed as a child: \\"He recalled envisioning the approach of 'the dark stranger' in a wide-brimmed hat, illumined by the moonlight streaming in through a half- open window. 'I slept and dreamed—or was I awake?' He glimpsed 'the tear- stained face of my adored mother,' as she slipped from view. He raised himself up weakly, to be led away by Death. Helping hands grabbed him, pushed him down, saved him. The horror of the dream-experience combined with 'a kind of mystical ecstasy which gave me, boy though I still was, the complete understanding of the ecstasy which made martyrs and saints embrace Death.' Lang recovered, 'but the love of Death, compounded of horror and affection,' he said, 'stayed with me and became a part of my films.'\\" Release =Theatrical release= For a time, the intertitles for the film were thought to be lost; Munich Stadtmuseum director Enno Patalas recovered most of them from the Cinématèque Française thanks to Lotte Eisner. =Home media= In 2016, Kino released a restored version of the film on Blu-ray. This release included Lang's original color tintings, thanks to the Murnau Foundation. Reception =Initial response= Destiny was poorly received on its release, with critics complaining that it was not 'German' enough. However, the film was well-received in France, which in turn brought it more acclaim in Germany. =Later response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on , with a weighted average rating of 8/10. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars, praising the film's art direction, photography, and special effects.  Analysis  John S. Titford of Cinema Journal includes the character Death as an example of Lang's thematic interest with humans acting as machines. He argues that characters like Death \\"take on the quality of symbols, become archetypes of sub-human forces who embody the concept of Destiny, or the threat to the German nation in the years immediately after the first World War.\\" The ghost-like appearance of Death is a recurring feature in Lang's films, reportedly stemming from dreams he had as a child. Similar figures appear in Metropolis (1927) and While the City Sleeps (1956). Legacy Luis Buñuel, director of Un Chien Andalou, was highly inspired by this film. He states: \\"When I saw Destiny, I suddenly knew that I wanted to make movies. It wasn’t the three stories themselves that moved me so much, but the main episode – the arrival of the man in the black hat (whom I instantly recognised as Death) in the Flemish village – and the scene in the cemetery. Something about this film spoke to something deep in me; it clarified my life and my vision of the world.\\" In Buñuel's Un Chien Andalou, two lovers are buried in the sand, in reference to the Frank's death in the film. Alfred Hitchcock once stated he was impressed with the film. Hollywood actor Douglas Fairbanks was reportedly so impressed with the film's special effects, the flying carpet scene in particular, he quickly secured the rights to the film, so they could be replicated for Raoul Walsh's 1924 film, The Thief of Baghdad. According to Robert Cashill of Cineaste, Bernhard Goetzke's performance as Death had an influence on Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal (1957).

They're also seen as an emoviolence band, sometimes verging on grindcore. The band has also been commonly labeled as hardcore punk. Earlier releases showed the band playing a more straightforward style that's heavily influenced by hardcore punk and grindcore, while later releases showed the band experimenting with progression and atmosphere, such as Document #7. All of the band's releases were known as \\"documents\\", according to the guitarist Mike Taylor, this was done because each release by the band was seen as a document of their state at the time of recording. The band has gone on to name many groups as influences, such as Born Against, Rorschach, Deadguy, Unwound, Jeromes Dream, Leonard Cohen (who is referenced by the band with their song \\"The Lonesome Waltz of Leonard Cohen\\"), Orchid, and Sunny Day Real Estate.

It lies 17 miles (27 km) east-northeast of Bristol and 93 miles (150 km) due west of London, with the M4 south of the parish. Acton Turville consists of a cluster of households across 1,009 acres, with a total population of 370 people.GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth, History of Acton Turville in South Gloucestershire  Map and description, A Vision of Britain through Time. Acton Turville is also listed as \\"Achetone\\" in the Domesday Book. According to John Marius in 1870, From the imperial gazetteer of England and Wales - Acton Turville is: \\"a parish in Chipping Sodbury district, Gloucester; near the Fosse way and under the Cotswold Hills. It lies 5.5 miles east of Chipping Sodbury, and 7.5 miles east of Yate railway station\\". Ordnance Survey of the Parish of Acton Turville located in Gloucestershire. Geography The source of the Avon is just north of the village. History =The Parish Church= The Parish Church St, Mary's is dated back to the 12th century and is Grade II* listed. According to the Church of England, in the Diocese of Gloucester \\"minor alterations were made in the 13th century and again in the 15th century\\". And, in 1853 with the help of architect T,H Wyatt, enlarged the parish church that was so central to the parish, due to a population increase within the parish. The church's stained glass windows were \\"due to the generosity of a few local benefactors\\", which were finely designed by some of the \\"leading studios of the day\\". The most notable benefactor in the parish - Reverend R H Mullens, who was appointed vicar in 1869, made a very generous donation to St Mary's Church in his retirement in 1911. One stained glass window was presented in memory of his wife. As the monarchy was restored, the presentation of a Royal Coat of Arms was made compulsory, asserting a royal \\"supremacy\\" within the church. St Mary's Church coat of arms reflects George III monarchy, dated 1801-1816. Population Total Population of Acton Turville, Gloucestershire, as reported by the Census of Population from 1801-2011 From the 1800s, population evidently began to rise until it reached a total of 175 residents in 1850. This can be explained by the events occurring in Gloucester in the 1800s, where city boundaries were beginning to be breached, and a population increase was beginning to take place in surrounding rural areas. Evidently, in 1852 suburbs were reported to be \\"extending\\" a considerable distance and villages and parish's such as Acton Turville, were beginning to increase up to six times more than the population a hundred years ago. Acton Turville's sudden increase in population can also be explained by the introduction of industry in the area, where new canals and railways were promoted. Following this, there was a significant decrease in population around the 1900s, where population was 20% lower than it was in 1850, possibly due to expansion in other surrounding areas. However, we see an exponential increase from 1950 to 2000, where population peaks at 370 residents, which to date, is the current population of Acton Turville. Religion and ethnicity The 2001 Census data, show Acton Turville to have a population of 328 British/Irish, and very small number of other ethnicity groups. The ward of Cotswold Edge however, presents a much more diverse range of results with a total of 78 residents from other ethnic groups such as; Irish, \\"other\\" White, \\"other\\" Mixed, Caribbean and Chinese. According to the 2011 census data, 72% are Christian, 18% have no specified religion and the remaining 8% state no religion at all. Economy Graph to show a range of occupations within the area of Acton Turville in 1831 Occupation Statistics of Residents in Acton Turville dated in 1881. This shows both the occupations of male and female residents in a number of professions. In the first census in 1801, Britain saw a great increase in international trade. A global introduction to trading is a fact that reflects on occupational change in such small villages such as Acton Turville. In the 1831 occupational statistics, where industrialisation is beginning, 0 residents were employed in the manufacturing industry, whereas 44 were employed in the agricultural sector. Women however, were extremely domesticated or under an \\"unspecified\\" occupation. In the following census data, 50 years later in 1881, more industrialised sectors appeared. The transport and communications sector had a total of 3 residents, where occupations such as \\"dress\\", \\"professionals\\", \\"domestic service and offices\\", and \\"workers in house, furniture and decorations\\" had increased with both male and female employees. In this 50 year difference, those employed in agriculture had decreased by 5, showing a progressive shift in industry. Evidence for this can also be reflected in the decline of servants which could explain the rising affluence within Acton Turville. Presently, a total of 6 residents are in the agricultural field, and a high number in education, real estate, manufacturing and retail in accordance with the 2001 census data. Transport Public transport in Acton Turville is limited, with the main transport link being the local bus service. The local bus service is named \\"Coachstyle\\", with a total of 12 bus links between locations such as: Bath, Bathwick, Yate, Malmesbury, Chippenham, Badminton and Hullavington. The nearest train stations are Yate and Chippenham which are around 7–8 miles away from the parish. According to the 2001 census data, only 6% of households in the parish are without a car/van. This shows evidence for the lack of reliance on public transport, whereas the result of those reliant on personal transport is a high result of 88.6%.

It often appears as a black dog but is known to take the form of other animals.Henderson, William (1879). Notes on the Folk-Lore of the Northern Counties of England and the Borders London: W. Satchell, Peyton and Co. p. 274. Retrieved 8 April 2015.Briggs, Katharine (1976). An Encyclopedia of Fairies. Pantheon Books. pp. 74–5. . English folklore The English church grim usually takes the form of a large black dog and guards churchyards from those who would profane them including thieves, vandals, witches, warlocks, and the Devil himself. In the 19th century, folklorists believed that it had once been the custom to bury a dog alive under the cornerstone of a church as a foundation sacrifice so that its ghost might serve as a guardian. Like many spectral black dogs, the grim, according to Yorkshire tradition, is also an ominous portent and is known to toll the church bell at midnight before a death takes place. During funerals the presiding clergyman may see the grim looking out from the churchtower and determine from its aspect whether the soul of the deceased is destined for Heaven or Hell. The grim inhabits the churchyard day and night and is associated with dark stormy weather.Wright, Elizabeth Mary (1913). Rustic Speech and Folk-Lore. Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press. p. 194. When a new churchyard was opened it was believed that the first person buried there had to guard it against the Devil. In order to prevent a human soul from having to perform such a duty a black dog was buried in the north part of the churchyard as a substitute.Tongue, Ruth (1965). County Folk-Lore (Vol. 8). p. 108. According to a related belief in Scotland the spirit of the person most recently buried in a churchyard had to protect it until the next funeral provided a new guardian to replace him or her.Campbell, John Gregorson (1900). Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons. p. 242. This churchyard vigil was known as the faire chlaidh or \\"graveyard watch\\". A folktale of the Devil's Bridge type is also an example of the motif of a dog (in this case a dog also named Grim) being sacrificed in place of a human being. In the North Riding of Yorkshire attempts were made to build a bridge that could withstand the fury of the floods but none were successful. The Devil promised to build one on condition that the first living creature that crossed it should serve as a sacrifice. When the bridge was complete the people gave long consideration as to who should be the victim. A shepherd who owned a dog named Grim swam across the river then whistled for Grim to follow, who went over the bridge and became the Devil's sacrifice. The bridge then became known as Kilgrim BridgeGutch, Eliza (1901). County Folk-Lore (Vol. 2). London: David Nutt. p. 19. and was later renamed Kilgram Bridge which today crosses the River Ure in North Yorkshire.\\"So where does Wensleydale end?\\".

It dwells in the churchtower or some other place of concealment, or wanders the grounds at night, and is tasked with protecting the sacred building. It keeps order in the church and punishes those who perpetrate scandals. It is said that the first founders of Christian churches would bury a lamb (\\"church-lamb\\") under the altar. When a person enters the church when services are not being held, he may see the lamb, and if it appears in the graveyard (especially to the gravedigger) then it portends the death of a child. In some tellings, the lamb is said to have only three legs. The lamb is meant to represent Christ (the Lamb of God) as the sacred cornerstone of the church, imparting security and longevity to the physical edifice and congregation. Other animals used to create the church grim included a boar, pig and horse. A grave-sow (or \\"graysow\\"), the ghost of a sow that was buried alive, was often seen in the streets of Kroskjoberg where it was regarded as an omen of death.Thiselton- Dyer, T. F. (1893). The Ghost World. London: Ward & Downey. pp. 125–6. There are tales of the Danish Kirkegrim and its battles with the Strand-varsler that tried to enter the churchyard. Strand-varsler are the spirits of those who die at sea, are washed up on the shore, and remain unburied. In Swedish tradition, a person attempting the Årsgång, or year walk, a divination ritual that involved circling a churchyard on New Year's Eve, would have to contend with the church grim, which was the natural enemy of the year walker. In popular culture The Last of the Giant Killers, published in 1891, includes a story where Jack the Giant Killer defeats an evil church grim that takes the shape of a goat. In this tale, Jack is helped by the ghost of a young woman who, like the church grim, was buried alive as a foundation sacrifice. \\"The Church- grim\\" by Eden Phillpotts is a short story published in the September 1914 edition of The Century Magazine, New York.

It was released by Charisma Records as a single from Gabriel's eponymous third album in 1980. The song is a musical eulogy, inspired by the death of the black South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko in police custody on 12 September 1977. Gabriel wrote the song after hearing of Biko's death on the news. Influenced by Gabriel's growing interest in African musical styles, the song carried a sparse two-tone beat played on Brazilian drum and vocal percussion, in addition to a distorted guitar, and a synthesised bagpipe sound. The lyrics, which included phrases in Xhosa, describe Biko's death and the violence under the apartheid government. The song is book-ended with recordings of songs sung at Biko's funeral: the album version begins with \\"Ngomhla sibuyayo\\" and ends with \\"Senzeni Na?\\", while the single versions end with \\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\\". \\"Biko\\" reached No. 38 on the British charts, and was positively received, with critics praising the instrumentation, the lyrics, and Gabriel's vocals. A 2013 commentary called it a \\"hauntingly powerful\\" song, while review website AllMusic described it as a \\"stunning achievement for its time\\". It was banned in South Africa, where the government saw it as a threat to security. \\"Biko\\" was a personal landmark for Gabriel, becoming one of his most popular songs and sparking his involvement in human rights activism. It also had a huge political impact, and along with other contemporary music critical of apartheid, is credited with making resistance to apartheid part of western popular culture. It inspired musical projects such as Sun City, and has been called \\"arguably the most significant non-South African anti-apartheid protest song\\". Background Bantu Stephen Biko was an anti-apartheid activist who was a founding member of the South African Students' Organisation in 1968 and the Black People's Convention in 1972. Through these groups, and through other activities, he promoted the ideas of the Black Consciousness movement, and became a prominent member of the resistance to apartheid in the 1970s. The government of South Africa placed a banning order on him in 1973, preventing him from leaving his hometown, meeting with more than one person, publishing his writing, and speaking in public. In August 1977 Biko was arrested for breaking his banning order. Steve Biko on a Heerlen church stained glass window After his arrest Biko was held in custody in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape for several days, during which he was interrogated. During his interrogation he was severely beaten by some of the policemen questioning him. He suffered severe injuries, including to his brain, and died soon after on 12 September 1977. News of his death spread quickly, and became a symbol of the abuses perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally. Several musicians wrote songs about Biko, including Tom Paxton, Peter Hammill, Steel Pulse, and Tappa Zukie. British musician Peter Gabriel, who heard of Biko's death through the BBC's coverage of the event, was moved by the story and began researching his life, based on which he wrote a song about the killing. This coincided with Gabriel becoming interested in African musical styles, which influenced his third solo album Peter Gabriel (1980), also known as Melt, on which \\"Biko\\" was ultimately included. Gabriel was also influenced to write the song through his association with politically inclined new-wave musician Tom Robinson; Robinson is said to have encouraged Gabriel to release the piece when Gabriel began to have doubts. Though there were other political songs on the album, \\"Biko\\" was the only piece that was explicitly a protest song. Music and lyrics Gabriel performing in 1978 The lyrics of the song begin in a manner similar to a news story, saying \\"September '77/Port Elizabeth, weather fine\\". The next lines mention \\"police room 619\\", the room in the police station of Port Elizabeth in which Biko was beaten. The English lyrics are broken up by the Xhosa phrase \\"Yila Moja\\" (also transliterated \\"Yehla Moya\\") meaning \\"Come Spirit\\": the phrase has been read as a call to Biko's spirit to join the resistance movement, and as a suggestion that though Biko was dead, his spirit was still alive. The tone of the songs shifts after the first verse, growing more defiant, and the second verse of the song criticises the violence under apartheid, with Gabriel singing about trying to sleep but being able to \\"only dream in red\\" because of his anger at the death of black people. The lyrics of the third verse seek to motivate the listener: \\"You can blow out a candle/But you can't blow out a fire/Once the flames begin to catch/The wind will blow it higher\\", suggesting that though Biko is dead, the movement against apartheid would continue. The lyrics express a sense of outrage, not only at the suffering of people under apartheid, but at the fact that that suffering was often forgotten or denied. Gabriel incorporated three songs by other composers into his recording. The album version of the songs start with an excerpt from the South African song \\"Ngomhla sibuyayo\\" and ends with a recording of the South African song \\"Senzeni Na?\\", as sung at Biko’s funeral. The 7- and 12-inch single versions ended instead with an excerpt from \\"Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika\\", a song which would later become South Africa's National Anthem. The German version of the song began and ended with \\"Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika\\". The recording ends with a double drum beat reminiscent of gun shots that cuts off the singers at the funeral, seen as representing a repressive government. The recording at the beginning of the song fades into a two-toned percussion, played on a Brazilian Surdo drum, described by Gabriel as the \\"spine of the piece\\". \\"Biko\\" makes use of a \\"hypnotic\\" drum beat throughout the song, influenced strongly by African rhythms Gabriel had heard. In particular, Gabriel would credit the soundtrack LP Dingaka with influencing the percussion of the track. Music scholar Michael Drewett writes that Gabriel tried to create an \\"exotic\\" African beat \\"without really approximating the sound he imitated\\", thus creating a \\"pseudo-African\\" beat. The tune is punctuated with vocal percussive sounds that have a \\"primordial\\" feeling, combining Gaelic and African influences. The drums are overlaid with an artificially distorted two-chord guitar sound, which fades out briefly during the vocal percussion, before returning during the first verse. The first verse describing Biko's death is followed by a distinct chord change before the Xhosa invocation \\"Yehla Moya\\". The sound of bagpipes, created with a synthesiser, enters the song during the interlude between the verses. Played in a \\"mournful\\" minor key, they have been variously described as creating a \\"funeral\\" and a \\"militaristic\\" atmosphere. The bagpipes continue alongside the drums and guitar through the second verse, followed by an interlude identical to the first. A snare drum is also added to the sound for the second and third verses. The third verse concludes with a non-verbal chant following the chord progression of the song, while the climax is a chorus of male voices, accompanied by bagpipes and drums. Recording and releases Gabriel provided lead vocals and piano. The guitarist for \\"Biko\\" was David Rhodes, Gabriel's longtime collaborator. Other participants included Jerry Marotta on drums, Phil Collins on surdo, Larry Fast on synths and synthesised bagpipes, and Dave Ferguson on screeches. However, a 2016 \\"listener's companion\\" to Gabriel's music named Phil Collins as the drummer on the song, Larry Fast as playing the synthesiser, and Jerry Marotta as playing the snare drum. \\"Biko\\" was first released as a single in 1980. Gabriel donated the proceeds from both versions of the single to the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa. These donations would total more than 50,000 pounds. The B-side of the 7\\" version contained Gabriel's version of the Ndebele folks song \\"Shosholoza\\", while the 12\\" version also carried a German vocal version of Gabriel's 1979 track \\"Here Comes the Flood\\". \\"Biko\\" was included on Gabriel's third solo album Peter Gabriel III (1980) (a.k.a. Melt) released by Charisma Records in 1980. At seven and one-half minutes, it was the album's longest song. The track was later included on his 1990 compilation Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats. Reception Upon its release \\"Biko\\" reached No. 38 on the British charts. The 1987 live version reached No. 49 in the UK. In 2016 Gabriel's biographer Durrell Bowman ranked \\"Biko\\" as among Gabriel's 11 most popular songs. Peter Gabriel III topped the British charts for two weeks, giving Gabriel his first No. 1 hit. Soon after its release, a copy of \\"Biko\\" was seized by South African customs and submitted to the Directorate of Publications, which banned the song and the album on which it featured for being critical of apartheid, calling it \\"harmful to the security of the State\\". Thus, despite enduring popularity outside South Africa, it had no presence within the country. The song received strongly positive responses from critics, and it was frequently cited as the highlight of the album. Phil Sutcliffe in Sounds magazine said the song was \\"so honest you might even risk calling it truth\\". Music website AllMusic called \\"Biko\\" a \\"stunning achievement for its time\\", and went on to say that \\"It's odd that such a bleak song can sound so freeing and liberating\\". Writing in 2013, Mark Pedelty would say that \\"Biko\\" \\"stood out for its unusual instrumentation (bagpipes and synthesiser), haunting vocals, and funerary chant,\\" and credited Gabriel with doing a \\"masterful job of creating catalytic imagery and getting out of the way\\". Music scholar Michael Drewett wrote that the lyrics skillfully engaged the listener by moving from a specific story to a call for action. The musical elements of the song also received praise. Drewett stated that Gabriel's singing throughout the song was \\"clear and powerful\\". Though Drewett questioned the use of bagpipes, he stated that they heightened the emotional effect of the song. 2013, scholar Ingrid Byerly called \\"Biko\\" a \\"hauntingly powerful\\" song, with \\"a hypnotic drumbeat thundering beneath commanding guitar, lyrical bagpipe dirges, and the intense eulogy of Gabriel's voice\\". A review in Rolling Stone was more critical of the song, saying that the melody and rhythms of the piece were \\"irresistible\\", but that the song was a \\"muddle\\", and that \\"what Gabriel [had] to say was mostly sentimental.\\" Gabriel's use of Xhosa lyrics have been read by scholars as evidence of the \\"authenticity\\" of Gabriel's effort to highlight Biko. By using a language that many South Africans, and the majority of outsiders, did not know, the words trigger curiosity; in the words of Byerly, \\"compelling [listeners]...to become, like Gabriel, insiders to the struggle\\". In contrast, scholar Derek Hook has written that the song highlighted the artist, rather than Biko himself, and \\"[secured] for the singer and his audience a kind of anti-racist social capital\\". Hook questioned whether the \\"consciousness raising\\" efforts of the song could turn into \\"anti-racist narcissism\\". Drewett stated that the use of a simplistic and generic \\"African\\" beat was an indication of an \\"imperial imagination\\" in the song's composition. Impact and legacy \\"Biko\\" had an enormous political impact. It has been credited with creating a \\"political awakening\\" both in terms of awareness of the brutalities of apartheid, and of Steve Biko as a person. It greatly raised Biko's profile, making his name known to millions of people who had not previously heard of him, and came to symbolise Biko in the popular imagination. Byerly writes that it was an example of the \\"right song written at the right time by the right person\\"; it was released in circumstances of social tension that contributed to its popularity and influence. It triggered a rise in enthusiasm for fighting against apartheid internationally, and has been described as \\"arguably the most significant non-South African anti-apartheid protest song\\". \\"Biko\\" was at the forefront of a stream of anti-apartheid music in the 1980s, and sparked a worldwide interest in music exploring the politics and society of South Africa. Along with songs such as \\"Free Nelson Mandela\\" by The Specials, and \\"Sun City\\" by Artists United Against Apartheid, \\"Biko\\" has been described as part of the \\"soundtrack for the global divestment movement\\", which sought to persuade divestment from companies doing business in apartheid South Africa. These songs have been described as making the fight against apartheid part of Western popular culture. Gabriel's piece has been credited as the inspiration for many of the anti-apartheid songs that followed it. Steven Van Zandt, the driving force behind the 1985 track \\"Sun City\\" and the Artists United Against Apartheid initiative, stated that hearing \\"Biko\\" inspired him to begin those projects; on the cover of the album, he thanked Gabriel \\"for the profound inspiration of his song ‘Biko’ which is where my journey to Africa began\\". Irish singer and U2 frontman Bono called Gabriel to tell him that U2 had learned of the effects of apartheid from \\"Biko\\". The song was a landmark for Gabriel's career. \\"Biko\\" has been called Gabriel's first political song, his \\"most enduring political tune\\", and \\"Arguably [his] first masterpiece\\". It caught the attention of activist organisations, and in particular anti-apartheid groups and human rights organisations such as Amnesty International (AI). \\"Biko\\" became popular among AI workers, along with Gabriel's 1982 song \\"Wallflower\\". The song triggered Gabriel's involvement in musical efforts against apartheid: he supported the \\"Sun City\\" project, and participated in two musical tours organised by AI: A Conspiracy of Hope in 1986, and Human Rights Now! in 1988. It also led to him beginning a deeper involvement in those groups. Other versions Gabriel sang the piece at Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in 1988. The concert featured a number of well-known artists, including Dire Straits, Miriam Makeba, Simple Minds, Eurythmics, and Tracy Chapman. During his live performances of \\"Biko\\", Gabriel frequently concluded asking the audience to engage in political action, saying \\"I've done what I can, the rest is up to you.\\" It was often the last song of a performance, with the band members gradually leaving the stage during the song's concluding drum coda. A live version, recorded in July 1987 at the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, was released as a single later that year, to promote Richard Attenborough's Biko biopic Cry Freedom. The music video consists of clips from the film and Gabriel singing. The song did not appear in the actual film. \\"Biko\\" was covered by a number of well known artists. Robert Wyatt's 1984 version from his Work in Progress EP made #35 in that year's John Peel Festive Fifty. \\"Biko\\" was featured prominently in \\"Evan\\", the penultimate episode of the first season of the American television show Miami Vice in 1985. Folk musicians and activist Joan Baez recorded a version on her 1987 album Recently. Simple Minds released a cover version on their 1989 album Street Fighting Years, a version later featured on other collections of their music. It was covered by Cameroonian musician Manu Dibango on his 1994 album Wakafrika. Dibango's version also featured Gabriel, Sinead O'Connor, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Geoffrey Oryema, and Alex Brown. Folk-rock musician Paul Simon recorded a cover of the song for inclusion on the 2013 Gabriel tribute album And I'll Scratch Yours.

It was written over the course of eight years from 1992 to 2000 when it was published by Knopf. The book argues that the nature of problems faced by our society are becoming more complex and that our ability to implement solutions is not keeping pace. Homer-Dixon focuses upon complexities, unexpected non-linear results, and emergent properties. He takes an inter- disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, and ecology. After Robert D. Kaplan referenced Homer-Dixon's work in the 1994 The Atlantic Monthly article, \\"The Coming Anarchy\\", Homer-Dixon was offered a book deal. He spent the next half decade preparing until it was finally published in 2000 in North America and the United Kingdom. While it spent three weeks at #1 on a Canadian best-seller list, it did not sell many copies in the United States. Critics were pleased with Homer-Dixon's scholarship, straightforward presentation, and the book's breadth but some found the writing to have a self-indulgent quality. Homer-Dixon was awarded the Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction in 2001 and the book went on to be translated into French and Spanish. Background Author Thomas Homer-Dixon was a 44-year-old academic and director at the University of Toronto's Peace and Conflict Studies program at the time of publication. While the book took eight years to write, Homer-Dixon had been developing the ideas behind it for most of his career. As a youth, an interest in current events was fostered by his parents and led him to study causes of human violence at university. He graduated from Carleton University with a Bachelor of Arts and, in 1989, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a doctorate in Political science. He accepted the director position at the Peace and Conflict Studies program in 1990. Homer-Dixon and his theories were featured in an article written by Robert D. Kaplan, in the February 1994 edition of The Atlantic Monthly, entitled \\"The Coming Anarchy\\". The article made him into an emerging academic celebrity and resulted in several book deal offers. By 1997 Homer-Dixon, working out of his home office, had accumulated more than of paper and was overwhelmed by the project, stating, \\"I'm living the problem I'm describing.\\" In 1999, Homer-Dixon and Princeton University Press published Environment, Scarcity, and Violence containing Homer-Dixon's research on resource scarcity leading to violence. For The Ingenuity Gap, he re-organized the framework along three strands, thematic, geographical, and metaphoric, and structured it like a travelogue from which he could launch examples. Content Homer-Dixon begins by presenting his personal and academic background that led to the drafting of this book. He establishes that the nature of problems are becoming overly burdensome, including providing resources for exponentially growing populations, managing international environmental impacts, and creating a secure global economic market. Modern problems often contain numerous factors that interact to create hidden complexities and non-linear results. The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis is used to illustrate a system in which professed experts had confidence in but internal and external factors compounded upon each other to create a sudden, unexpected drop. The delusion of control, or the assumption that experts were in control, led to overconfidence in an economic system that was not well understood. Homer-Dixon finds that the experts are just as susceptible to groupthink as non-experts and that they have boundless capacity for hindsight rationalization of unexpected movements. As older problems are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction of these new parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and increase the amount of time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence. Homer-Dixon explains how his theory was influenced by endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science. Style The Ingenuity Gap is a popular science book. Homer-Dixon takes an inter-disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, biology, and ecology. The narrative is structured as a travelogue as the author travels to meet experts and construct his theory. His observations along the way illustrate the concepts he is explaining and supplement interviews and research. Collecting pieces of his theory from each of his interviews and destinations appears as a recurring metaphor. He includes anecdotes and social commentary. Publication and reception The book was published in September 2000 as a hardcover, and Homer-Dixon shortly after began a 10-city tour across Canada with stops in Toronto, Ottawa, Kingston, Hamilton, London, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Victoria, amongst several other smaller venues. Promotional events were also held in the United States and England. It was published by Knopf in North America and by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom. An excerpt was published in the October issue of Report on Business Magazine. In the Canadian market, the book spent seven weeks on the Maclean's nonfiction best sellers' list, including three weeks at the #1 spot.. Note: The book debuted at #4 on November 6 and was listed at #1 in the November 13, November 20, and November 27 issues. It was #6 on December 4, #10 on December 10, and #9 on December 18. It did not sell well in the United States. Homer- Dixon was awarded the 2001 Governor General's Award for English language non- fiction for the book. The trade paperback was released a year after the hardcover edition. It was translated into French and published in 2002 by Éditions du Boréal. A Spanish version was published by Espasa in 2003. Homer- Dixon went on to write a similar book, The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization, in which he elaborates upon the idea that societies are becoming less able to cope with problems, like global warming or population imbalances, as complexities compound each other and the readily available resources, like fossil fuels, are rapidly consumed. The book's scholarship was very well received by critics. The research behind the book was called impressive for its breadth, and its presentation was said to be straightforward and thought-provoking. Critics called Homer-Dixon's writing clear, accessible, and engaging. In his review in the Quill & Quire, Mark Shainblum wrote \\"[d]espite the book's serious import and prodigious endnotes, The Ingenuity Gap is a surprisingly engaging and even exciting read. Homer- Dixon spins parables masterfully, using comprehensible examples to represent the almost incomprehensible complexity of our social system.\\" The Library Journal highly recommended it for academic and general public libraries. Several critics were disappointed by the lack of recommendations to address the problems he raises. The reviewers for Books in Canada, The Canadian Geographer, and the National Post found Homer-Dixon's writing self-indulgent because it overly details his travels and experiences, and because of his overly authoritative tone that compliments people that agree with him and shows little consideration of differing perspectives.

Typically, all stages of manufacture are carried out by the artists themselves.Emmanuel Cooper, Ten Thousand Years of Pottery. British Museum Press, 2000. . Studio pottery includes functional wares such as tableware and cookware, and non-functional wares such as sculpture. Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists, ceramists, ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium. Much studio pottery is tableware or cookware, but an increasing number of studio potters produce non-functional (sometimes called decorative) or sculptural items. In Britain since the 1980s, there has been a distinct trend away from functional pottery, for example, the work of artist Grayson Perry. Some studio potters now prefer to call themselves ceramic artists, ceramists or simply artists. Studio pottery is represented by potters all over the world and has strong roots in Britain. Art pottery is a related term, used by many potteries from about the 1870s onwards, in Britain and America; it tends to cover larger workshops, where there is a designer supervising the production of skilled workers who may have input into the pieces made. The heyday of British and American art pottery was about 1880 to 1940. Since the second half of the 20th century ceramics has become more highly valued in the art world. There are now several large exhibitions worldwide, including Collect and Origin (formerly the Chelsea crafts fair) in London, International Sculpture Objects & Functional Art Fair (SOFA) Chicago and International Sculpture Objects & Functional Art Fair (SOFA) New York City which includes ceramics as an art form. Ceramics have realized high prices, reaching several thousands of pounds for some pieces, in auctions houses such as Bonhams and Sotheby's.  British studio pottery  =Pre-1900= The Martin brothers in their studio Notable studios included Brannam Pottery, Castle Hedingham Ware, Martin Brothers and Sir Edmund Harry Elton. =1900-1960: Development of contemporary British ceramics= Several influences contributed to the emergence of studio pottery in the early 20th century: art pottery (for example the work of the Martin Brothers and William Moorcroft); the Arts and Crafts movement, the Bauhaus; a rediscovery of traditional artisan pottery and the excavation of large quantities of Song pottery in China. Leading trends in British studio pottery in the 20th century are represented by Bernard Leach, William Staite Murray, Waistel Cooper, Dora Billington, Lucie Rie and Hans Coper. Originally trained as a fine artist, Bernard Leach (1887–1979) established a style of pottery, the ethical pot, strongly influenced by Chinese, Korean, Japanese and medieval English forms. After briefly experimenting with earthenware, he turned to stoneware fired to high temperatures in large oil- or wood-burning kilns. This style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th century. Leach's influence was disseminated by his writings, in particular A Potter's BookLeach, Bernard. A Potter’s Book, Faber and Faber, 1988. and the apprentice system he ran at his pottery in St Ives, Cornwall, through which many notable studio potters passed. A Potter's Book espoused an anti-industrial, Arts and Crafts ethos, which persists in British studio pottery. Leach taught intermittently at Dartington Hall, Devon from the 1930s. Other ceramic artists exerted an influence through their positions in art schools. William Staite Murray, who was head of the ceramics department of the Royal College of Art, treated his pots as works of art, exhibiting them with titles in galleries. Dora Billington (1890–1968) studied at Hanley School of Art, worked in the pottery industry and was latterly head of pottery at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. She worked in media that Leach did not, e.g. tin-glazed earthenware, and influenced potters such as William Newland, James Tower,Timothy Wilcox, The ceramic art of James Tower 2012 Margaret Hine,Oliver Watson, Studio Pottery, London: Phaidon Press, 1993Nicholas VergetteJulian Stair, \\"Dora Billington\\", Crafts, 154, September/October 1998 and Alan Caiger-Smith. Thrown vase by Lucie Rie Lucie Rie (1902–1995) came to London in 1938 as a refugee from Austria. She had studied at the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule and has been regarded as essentially a modernist. Rie experimented and produced new glaze effects. She was a friend of Leach and was greatly impressed by his approach, especially about the \\"completeness\\" of a pot.Gowing, Christopher, and Rice, Paul, British Studio Ceramics in the 20th Century, Barrie and Jenkins, 1989, p. 113. The bowls and bottles which she specialised in are finely potted and sometimes brightly coloured. She taught at Camberwell College of Arts from 1960 until 1972. Hans Coper (1920–1981), also a refugee, worked with Rie before moving to a studio in Hertfordshire. His work is non-functional, sculptural and unglazed. He was commissioned to produce large ceramic candlesticks for Coventry Cathedral in the early 1960s. He taught at Camberwell College of Arts from 1960 to 1969, where he influenced Ewen Henderson. He taught at the Royal College of Art from 1966 to 1975, where his students included Elizabeth Fritsch, Alison Britton, Jacqui Poncelet, Carol McNicoll, Geoffrey Swindell, Jill Crowley and Glenys Barton, all of whom produce non-functional work. After the Second World War, studio pottery in Britain was encouraged by two forces: the wartime ban on decorating manufactured pottery and the modernist spirit of the Festival of Britain.Harrod, Tanya, \\"From A Potter's Book to The Maker's Eye: British Studio Ceramics 1940-1982\\", in The Harrow Connection, Northern Centre for Contemporary Art, 1989 Studio potters provided consumers with an alternative to plain industrial ceramics. Their simple, functional designs chimed in with the modernist ethos. Cranks restaurant, which opened in 1961, used Winchombe pottery throughout, which Tanya Harrod describes as \\"handsome, functional with pastoral but up to date air\\". Cranks represented the look of the period. Elizabeth David's food revolution of the post-war years was associated with a similar kitchen look and added to the demand for hand-made tableware. Harrod notes that several potteries were formed in response to this fifties boom. There was in turn a demand for potters trained in workshop practice and able to throw quickly. As this training was not offered by the art schools of the period, the Harrow Art School studio pottery diploma was created to fill the gap. According to Harrod, \\"the production potter of the Harrow type had a good innings well into the seventies\\", by which time the market for this style of pottery was falling away. = 1960s-present: Modern British potters = From the 1960s onwards, a new generation of potters, influenced by Camberwell School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design including Ewen Henderson, Alison Britton, Elizabeth Fritsch, Gordon Baldwin, Ruth Duckworth and Ian Auld began to experiment\\\\abstract ceramic objects, varied surface and glaze effects to critical acclaim. Elizabeth Fritsch has work represented in major collections and museums worldwide. The number of potters increased in the mid-1970s the Craft Potters Association had 147 members and by the mid-1990s it had 306.Potters, The Craft Potters' Association members directory, 3rd edition and 11th edition. = British organisations = A representative body for studio pottery in the United Kingdom is the Craft Potters Association, which has a members’ showroom in Great Russell Street, London WC1, and publishes a journal, Ceramic Review.  US studio pottery  Pottery had been an integral part of the United States Arts and Crafts movement in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Charles Fergus Binns, who was the first director of the New York State School of Clay-Working and Ceramics at Alfred University, was an important influence. Some potters in the United States adopted the approach from emerging studio pottery movements in Britain and Japan. In addition, American folk pottery of the southeastern United States was seen as an American contribution to studio pottery. University programs at Ohio State University, under the direction of Arthur Eugene Baggs in 1928 and under Glen Lukens in 1936 at the University of Southern California, began training ceramic students in presenting clay ware as art. Baggs had been intimately involved in the Arts and Crafts movement at Marblehead Pottery and, during the 1930s, he revived interest in the salt glazing method for studio pottery. European artists coming to the United States contributed to the public appreciation of pottery as art, and included Marguerite Wildenhain, Maija Grotell, Susi Singer and Gertrude and Otto Natzler. Significant studio potters in the United States include Otto and Vivika Heino, Warren MacKenzie, Paul Soldner, Peter Voulkos and Beatrice Wood. = US organizations = * National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts * American Ceramic Society; mainly focused on scientific research rather than studio pottery.

He got his break through in his second year as a professional, when he won the 1995 edition of Gent–Wevelgem. In the 1997 Vuelta a España he won stage 1 and wore the leader's jersey for three days (stage 2, 3 and 5). In 2002 he finished fifth in Paris–Roubaix, a result he would duplicate in 2005. In the 2006 Paris–Roubaix he was once again in the group of favourites, but he helped teammate Fabian Cancellara win the race and finished 19th himself. In his last race, the 2007 Paris–Roubaix, he finished 11th after a strong race, where only a mechanical failure prevented him from following the favorites. Again a teammate, Stuart O'Grady, won the race. Michaelsen rode at four Olympic Games. After retiring he became a directeur sportif, continuing with his final team until 2011 when he joined .

The highway connects Cle Elum to Blewett Pass and begins at an interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90) in Cle Elum. Traveling east, SR 970 intersects SR 903 north of the interchange and SR 10 in Teanaway before ending at U.S. Route 97 (US 97) in Virden. The highway was first added to the state highway system in 1909 as part of the Snoqualmie Pass Road and State Road 7\\\\. It was later signed as the Sunset Highway in 1913 and State Road 2 in 1923 before becoming part of US 97 and US 10\\\\. State Road 2 became Primary State Highway 2 (PSH 2) in 1937 and was replaced by US 97 during the 1964 highway renumbering. US 97 was realigned onto SR 131 between Thorp and Virden in 1975 and SR 970 was created on the former route. Route description SR 970 east of its western terminus, a diamond interchange with I-90 SR 970 begins at a diamond interchange with I-90 southeast of Cle Elum. The highway travels northeast and crosses over a BNSF rail line before intersecting SR 903, another highway that travels into Downtown Cle Elum. SR 970 turns southeast to intersect SR 903 Spur and continues out of Cle Elum and towards Teanaway, following the rail line and the Yakima River upstream. The highway intersects SR 10 south of De Vere Field and continues as a two-lane roadway northeast following the Teanaway River to Virden, also known as Lauderdale Junction, where SR 970 ends at an intersection with US 97. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 2,800 and 5,600 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Cle Elum area. SR 970 is designated as a part of the National Highway System and as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes principal arterials that are needed to connect major communities in the state. History PSH 2 and its branches, at the time of the 1964 highway renumbering. SR 970 was first defined under law to be built and paved by the state of Washington in 1909 as part of the Snoqualmie Pass Road, signed as State Road 7, between Snoqualmie Pass and Blewett Pass. The highway was renamed to the Sunset Highway in 1913 and became State Road 2 during a 1923 restructuring of the state highway system. State Road 2 became concurrent with US 10 from Cle Elum to Teanaway and US 97 from Cle Elum to Virden after the creation of the United States Numbered Highways in 1926. State Road 2 became PSH 2 during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937 and US 10 was moved onto US 97 over Blewett Pass in the late 1930s. US 10 was moved to its original route in 1946 after US 2 was extended west from Idaho. After the 1964 highway renumbering, PSH 2 was removed from the highway system and replaced with US 97. US 10 was replaced with SR 10 in 1970 and US 97 was moved east on SR 131 in 1975, constructed two years prior to the realignment. SR 970 was established on the former route of US 97 in 1975 and repairs to the highway were needed immediately, with WSDOT deciding against dropping the designation from the state highway system and turning over the highway to Kittitas County in 1985. No major revisions to the route of SR 970 have occurred since 1975.

His participation in the radical Anti-Vietnam War movement convinced him that he should choose an artistic career. He lives in Oslo.  Common themes There have been several common themes in his art, ranging from environmentalism, to the European Union, as well as the peace movement and politics. Frequent motifs are religion and scenes from the Romsdal and Lofoten areas of Norway. Among his environmentally themed works, Groven created several works in the 1970s that propagated the nature conservation. Much of his artwork commented on the fear that the Norway's newly-won status as a petroleum-producing country would lead to excessive pollution.Oil Painting He also commented on the dangers of nuclear powerThe nuclear power kid and he agitated for the preservation of waterfalls.VandalismSite Inspection His politically charged works include European Union, for which Norway has held two referendums about joining.

Under Mrs. Belinda Pearl the Academic team has made it to state multiple times. Academic team is a contest where students answer questions with a buzzer system. The questions are over a variety of topics including math, science, history, language, sports, current events, and common knowledge. Contestants are awarded points for every question answered correctly, and there are four rounds: the first and third consist of 15 toss-ups and the second and fourth contain 10 toss-ups with the potential for bonus questions on a correct toss-up response. Bonuses are questions that require 4 answers for the correct answer. Players get 10 pts for every toss-up and 5 pts for each of the four parts of a bonus question. Union Star was a dominant competitor through most of the 1960s in six-man football, at one point going over half a decade without losing a contest. Northwest Missouri schools switched to eight-man football almost immediately following this period, and the Trojans still compete in the MSHSAA eight-man league. The team's most recent football team accolade came in 1989, when the Union Star team won a District Championship, advancing to the State Semifinal. In 2006 The football team finished with a 1-9 record under Coach Tom Corrington. The starting quarterback was Matthew Tritten who was the team's most valuable player.

It features recordings of Star Wars-themed Christmas songs and stories about a droid factory where the robots make toys year-round for \\"S. Claus\\". Much of the album is sung and narrated by British actor Anthony Daniels, reprising his role as C-3PO from the Star Wars films. Sound designer Ben Burtt also provided sound effects for R2-D2 and Chewbacca.  Production  The album was produced by Meco Monardo (who had previously recorded Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk), with the hope that this would be the first in a series of annual Star Wars Christmas albums. The majority of the album's original songs, both music and lyrics, were written by Maury Yeston, a Yale University music professor who went on to become a Tony Award- winning Broadway musical composer. One of his songs, \\"What Can You Get A Wookiee For Christmas (When He Already Owns A Comb)\\", with vocals by Yeston, went on to become a recurring top-40 X-mas hit. The album is notable for featuring the first professional recording of Jon Bon Jovi (credited as \\"John Bongiovi\\", his birth name), who sang lead vocals on the song \\"R2-D2 We Wish You a Merry Christmas.\\" His cousin Tony Bongiovi co-produced the album and ran the recording studio at which it was recorded, where Jon was working sweeping floors at the time. After the first printing of 150,000 copies, Meco was asked to allow George Lucas' name to be credited beside his under \\"Concept by\\". Due to the success of the album, the studios were ready to do a second printing, which would give Lucas credit. But before the second record printing could be done, RSO Records shut down due to an unrelated lawsuit.

This original printing featured cover art by the Star Wars film's production artist, Ralph McQuarrie. The cassette version is now quite hard to come by. Also in 1980, RSO released a 45 of \\"What Can You Get a Wookiee for Christmas (When He Already Owns a Comb)\\" (credited to The Star Wars Intergalactic Droid Choir and Chorale- actually Yeston's voice, auto- tuned, and multi-tracked; Yeston also is the voice of Santa on \\"The Meaning of Christmas\\") backed with \\"R2-D2 We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" with a picture sleeve. In late 1983, a second 45 from the album was released by Polygram on the RSO label, \\"R2D2's Sleigh Ride\\" backed with \\"Christmas in the Stars\\", also with a picture sleeve. This album was one of the music industry's first non- classical-or-jazz projects to be recorded and mixed digitally, and when \\"What Can You Get a Wookiee for Christmas (When He Already Owns a Comb)\\" reached No. 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1980 it was only the third digitally recorded single in the chart's history. = CD = In November 1990, Polydor Records Japan released a 3-inch CD single featuring the songs \\"R2-D2 We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" and \\"Christmas in the Stars\\". The album made its CD debut in 1994 as an unheralded budget-label release by JFC/Polygram Special Markets with all artwork and references to Star Wars (except for those in the song titles) removed from the packaging. The only credit on the package was \\"Meco\\" and it featured a generic cover photo of Christmas boxes and decorations. In October 1996, during the popularity of the Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire project, the album was re-released on CD by Rhino Records with Ralph McQuarrie's cover art restored.

It breeds in North and South America. Northern populations winter in the warmer waters of the Caribbean and the tropical and subtropical Pacific coasts, but the South American races make only shorter movements in response to annual floods which extend their feeding areas in the river shallows. Taxonomy The black skimmer was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1755 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae and given the binomial name Rynchops niger. The genus name Rynchops is from the Ancient Greek rhunkhos \\"bill\\" and ops \\"face\\". The specific niger is the Latin word for \\"black\\". The black skimmer is one of three species in the genus Rynchops. There are three subspecies: *R. n. niger (Linnaeus, 1758) – migratory, breeds on the Atlantic coast of North America, and from southern California to Ecuador in the Pacific *R. n. cinerascens (von Spix, 1825) – is larger, has dusky underwings, only narrow white fringe to its black tail, and breeds in northern and northeastern South America and the Amazon basin *R. n. intercedens (Saunders, 1895) – occurs on the rest of the Atlantic coast of South America south to central Argentina  Description  The black skimmer is the largest of the three skimmer species. It measures long with a wingspan. (2011). This species ranges from , with males averaging about , as compared to the smaller females .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . The basal half of the bill is red, the rest mainly black, and the lower mandible is much-elongated. The eye has a dark brown iris and catlike vertical pupil, unique for a bird. The legs are red. The call is a barking kak-kak-kak. Adults in breeding plumage have a black crown, nape and upper body. The forehead and underparts are white. The upper wings are black with white on the rear edge, and the tail and rump are dark grey with white edges. The underwing colour varies from white to dusky grey depending on region. Non-breeding adults have paler and browner upperparts, and a white nape collar. Immature birds have brown upperparts with white feather tips and fringes. The underparts and forehead are white, and the underwings as the adult. Behaviour and ecology Skimmers loafing gregariously on a sandbar. Skimmers will often lay flat on the ground. feeding, Texas feeding, Brazil They spend much time loafing gregariously on sandbars in the rivers, coasts and lagoons they frequent. =Breeding= The black skimmer breeds in loose groups on sandbanks and sandy beaches in the Americas, the three to seven heavily dark-blotched buff or bluish eggs being incubated by both the male and female. The chicks leave the nest as soon as they hatch and lie inconspicuously in the nest depression or \\"scrape\\" where they are shaded from high temperatures by the parents. They may dig their own depressions in the sand at times. Parents feed the young almost exclusively during the day with almost no feeding occurring at night, due to the entire population of adults sometimes departing the colony to forage. Although the mandibles are of equal length at hatching, they rapidly become unequal during fledging. =Feeding= Skimmers have a light graceful flight, with steady beats of their long wings. They feed usually in large flocks, flying low over the water surface with the lower mandible skimming the water (in order of importance) for small fish, insects, crustaceans and molluscs caught by touch by day or especially at night. =Development= File:Rynchops niger1.jpgChick and egg File:Black Skimmer and Chick by Dan Pancamo.jpgAdult feeding a chick File:Black Skimmer Chicks by Dan Pancamo.jpgJuveniles at four weeks.

It was erected by the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great as his palace chapel during the first quarter of the 6th century (as attested to in the Liber Pontificalis). This Arian church was originally dedicated in 504 AD to \\"Christ the Redeemer\\".A study of the mosaics in the Basilica of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, Italy. , 2010\\" It was reconsecrated in 561 AD, under the rule of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, under the new name \\"Sanctus Martinus in Coelo Aureo\\" (\\"Saint Martin in Golden Heaven\\"). Suppressing the Arian church, the church was dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours, a foe of Arianism. According to legend, Pope Gregory the Great ordered that the mosaics in the church be blackened, as their golden glory distracted worshipers from their prayers. The basilica was renamed again in 856 AD when relics of Saint Apollinaris were transferred from the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe because of the threat posed by frequent raids of pirates from the Adriatic Sea. Its apse and atrium underwent modernization at various times, beginning in the 6th century with the destruction of mosaics whose themes were too overtly Arian or which expressed the king's glory, but the mosaics of the lateral walls, twenty-four columns with simplified Corinthian capitals, and an Ambo are preserved. On some columns, images of arms and hands can be seen, which are parts of figures once representing praying Goths and Theodoric's court, deleted in Byzantine times. Renovations (and alterations) were done to the mosaics in the mid-19th century by Felice Kibel. The present apse is a reconstruction after being damaged during World War I. Architecture and decoration View towards the Apses On the upper band of the left lateral wall are 13 small mosaics, depicting Jesus' miracles and parables; and on the right wall are 13 mosaics depicting the Passion and Resurrection. However, the flagellation and crucifixion are lacking. They describe the parts of the Bible that were read aloud in the church during Lent under the rule of Theodoric the Great. On the left, Jesus is always depicted as young, beardless man, dressed as a Roman Emperor. On the right, Jesus is depicted with a beard. For the Arians, this emphasized that Jesus grew older and became a \\"man of sorrows\\", as spoken of by the prophet Isaiah. These mosaics are separated by decorative mosaic panels depicting a shell-shaped niche with a tapestry, cross, and two doves. These mosaics were executed by at least two artists. Mosaic on the right side wall of the nave: palace of Theodoric. Remains of hands are still visible in the columns. The next row of mosaics are a scheme of haloed saints, prophets and evangelists, sixteen on each side. The figures are executed in a Hellenistic-Roman tradition and show a certain individuality of expression as compared to the other figures in the basilica. Each individual depicted holds a book, in either scroll or codex format, and, like many of the other figures throughout the basilica, each of their robes has a mark or symbol in it. These mosaics alternate with windows. They were executed in the time of Theodoric. The row below contains large mosaics in Byzantine style, lacking any individuality, having all identical expressions. These were executed about 50 years after the time of bishop Agnellus, when the church had already become an orthodox church. To the left is a procession of the 22 Virgins of the Byzantine period, led by the Three Magi, moving from the city of Classe towards the group of the Madonna and Child surrounded by four angels. (The Magi in this mosaic are named Balthasar, Melchior and Gaspar; this is thought to be the earliest example of these three names being assigned to the Magi in Christian art.) To the right is a similar procession of 26 Martyrs, led by Saint Martin and including Saint Apollinaris, moving from the Palace of Theodoric towards a group representing Christ enthroned amid four angels. This lower band, containing a schematic representation of the Palace of Theoderic on the right wall and the port of Classe with three ships on the left wall, gives us a certain idea of the architecture in Ravenna during the time of Theodoric. In another part of the church there is a rough mosaic containing the portrait of the Emperor Justinian. The entrance of the church is preceded by a marble portico built in the 16th century. Next to the church, on the right side of the portico, stands a round bell tower dating from the 9th or 10th century. When the UNESCO inscribed the church on the World Heritage List, its experts pointed out that \\"both the exterior and interior of the basilica graphically illustrate the fusion between the western and eastern styles characteristic of the late 5th to early 6th century. This is one of the most important buildings from the period of crucial cultural significance in European religious art\\".UNESCO World Heritage List - Early Christian Monuments of Ravenna: Advisory Body Evaluation. Some art historians claim that one of the mosaics contains the first depiction of Satan in western art. In the mosaic, a blue angel appears to the left hand side of Jesus behind three goats (mentioned in St Matthew's account of Judgement Day).

Incorporated in 1890, the town was founded by Hiram Walker, owner and producer of Canadian Club Whisky. Walker planned it as a 'model town’ (originally called 'Walker's Town') that would be the envy of both the region and the continent. He established a distillery on the Detroit River, diversifying the business by growing grain, milling flour, and raising cattle and hogs. Later, the town supported other major industries, notably automotive manufacturing. Annexed to Windsor, July 1st, 1935. Architecture Walker established homes for his workers, a church dedicated to his late wife, and a school. The town, which developed outward from the distillery, included buildings designed by Albert Kahn, notably Willistead Manor, the home of Walker's second son, Edward Chandler Walker. Upon Walkerville’s eventual amalgamation with Windsor, the Manor became heritage-protected property of the city, being used as an art gallery and, currently, a function venue. The neighbourhood is characterized by large houses, wide streets and abundant greenery. A three-story high school, carrying the name 'Walkerville', stands next to Willistead Manor. Other structures include former Prime Minister Paul Martin’s home, Kahn- designed houses, the distillery (now belonging to Wiser’s ) and the Via Rail station. The Tivoli Theatre (recently reopened Old Walkerville Theatre), is of 1920s art-deco design by C. Howard Crane (who would also design the Fox Theater in Detroit, Michigan). A large performance stage, ornate fixtures, balconies, and grating-lattice hint at the community's grandeur in those days.http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2013/07/17/new-owners-eager-to-restore- theatre-to-its- glory/http://www.internationalmetropolis.com/2007/11/26/walkerville-theatre/ Social and industrial growth Divided into three sub-precincts, Walkerville was an amalgam of business, commercial, and residential land use, at times all nestled together. This cohesive character gave the community its uniqueness as compared to surrounding cities. Walker acted as self-appointed overseer of everything, including the police, fire and church facilities. During the period of Prohibition in the United States, Walkerville became a principal source of cross-border alcohol exportation. Hiram Walker favoured diversification and Walkerville welcomed many industries including the automotive industry. The Ford Motor Company of Canada opened its factory there in 1904, followed by the E-M-F Company whose plant was acquired by Studebaker in 1910 and which became the assembly line for right-hand-drive vehicles exported to the UK and British Empire. In 1929, the Financial Post reported that 500 of the town's families were supported by Studebaker, > \\"only one of its activities being the manufacture of motor cars.

It is also called the Orthodox Baptistery to distinguish it from the Arian Baptistery constructed on behest of Ostrogothic King Theodoric some 50 years later. History The octagonal brick structure was erected during the late Western Roman Empire by Bishop Ursus at the end of the 4th or beginning of the 5th century, as part of his great Basilica (destroyed in 1734). The baptistery was finished by Bishop Neon at the end of the 5th century, at which time the mosaic decorations were added. Architecture and Decoration The original floor is now some 3 meters underground, so the proper structure and extent of the building can no longer be seen. The octagonal design of the building, employed in virtually all Early Christian baptisteries, symbolizes the seven days of the week plus the Day of the Resurrection and Eternal Life. The ceiling mosaic depicts John the Baptist baptizing Jesus (depicted with beard) standing waist high in the Jordan River. To one side stands the personification of the Jordan river, with a reed in one hand and a garment in the other. A procession of the twelve apostles proceeds around the center mosaic in two directions, ending with Saint Peter meeting Saint Paul. The ceiling mosaic in the Baptistry of Neon The Baptistry is one of the eight structures in Ravenna registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. According to the ICOMOS evaluation of this patrimony, \\"this is the finest and most complete surviving example of the early Christian baptistery\\" which \\"retains the fluidity in representation of the human figure derived from Greco-Roman art\\".

He purchased the Sun in 1949, and served as its editor and publisher until his death. Greenspun was also a prominent real estate developer in the Las Vegas Valley. Early years Greenspun was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of immigrants from then Russian-dominated Poland. During World War II, while stationed in Northern Ireland, Greenspun met his wife, Barbara, at a dinner party hosted by Maureen Black (née Peres) daughter of Harold Peres of Solomon and Peres and wife of British Businessman, Roy Keith Black. As a young man, Greenspun became closely involved with Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel and the work he was doing to reopen his Flamingo casino. Greenspun worked as the Flamingos's publicity agent. Following the murder of Siegel in Los Angeles in 1947, Greenspun renewed his interest in his Jewish heritage and became a prominent figure in supporting the struggle to establish the State of Israel. People standing on the Newseum's Hank Greenspun Terrace, which overlooks Pennsylvania Avenue and the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The United States Capitol, the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, and the Embassy of Canada are visible in the background. Supplies arms to foreign power In 1947, when the Haganah was already in armed conflict with Arab forces, Greenspun shipped machine guns and airplane parts to that organization (which later became the core of the Israel Defense Forces). This was a violation of the U.S. Neutrality Acts, a crime for which Greenspun was arrested and ultimately convicted on July 10, 1950. He was fined $10,000 but received no prison time. On October 18, 1961, President John F. Kennedy granted Greenspun a pardon. Upon Greenspun's death in 1989, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres called Greenspun \\"a hero of our country and a fighter for freedom.\\" Feuds with Joe McCarthy Greenspun began a feud with Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1952, publishing several articles attacking him as a demagogue. He also wrote articles accusing McCarthy of being a homosexual, an act that brought Greenspun considerable criticism, even among McCarthy foes. Greenspun became further entrenched in domestic politics when allegations were made that he held blackmail information against prominent Democratic presidential nominees. Tied to Watergate scandal On June 17, 1972, Virgilio González, Bernard Barker, James W. McCord, Jr., Eugenio Martínez and Frank Sturgis were arrested while placing electronic devices in the Democratic Party campaign offices in an apartment block called Watergate, in Washington, D.C. It later emerged that people working for President Richard Nixon wanted to wiretap the conversations of Larry O'Brien, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The Watergate Scandal developed from this incident, leading to wide-ranging investigations, Congressional hearings, and steady media coverage for the next two years. On May 23, 1973, McCord admitted that this group (known as the \\"Plumbers\\") had been involved in several covert activities. This included a plot to steal documents from Hank Greenspun's safe. McCord testified that Attorney General John N. Mitchell had told him that Greenspun had in his possession blackmail type information involving a Democratic candidate for president. As Greenspun was an avowed Republican, it was assumed that Greenspun would use his political influence and connections to sway the election. Business dealings Immediately after Greenspun's death, his family entered the Sun into a joint operating agreement with the Las Vegas Review-Journal. As a result, the Sun operated as an afternoon daily from 1990 on. Beginning in October 2005, under an amended joint operating agreement, the paper began delivery with the morning Review-Journal as an insert. Greenspun formed The Greenspun Corporation to manage the family's assets. Greenspun was also heavily involved in real estate, acquiring most of the western portion of Henderson, Nevada for a development that eventually became Green Valley. Much of the original seed money for the real estate investment was acquired through a loan from the Teamsters Union. His family controls the majority of this land and associated real estate developments, including golf courses and the Green Valley Ranch, Resort and Spa with interest being held through The Greenspun Corporation. Greenpsun started the first TV station in Nevada, KLAS-TV. A middle-school in Henderson, Nevada, was dedicated to Hank and Barbara Greenspun. In 2008, SGP Media produced the feature documentary about the life and times of Hank Greenspun, narrated by Anthony Hopkins.Where I Stand  PaletteMusic Personal life In 1944, he married Northern Ireland native, Barbara Joan Ritchie who also was Jewish. They had 4 children: Brian Greenspun, president and editor of the Sun and chairman of The Greenspun Corporation; Daniel Greenspun, president of the Greenspun Media Group and vice president of the Sun; Susan Greenspun Fine, member of the Anti-Defamation League Board; and Jane Greenspun Gale, animal-rights activist. Barbara died in 2010 at the age of 88. Barbara & Hank Greenspun Junior High School, a middle school in the Henderson, Nevada opened in 1991 in honor of the two.

It is located on the north shore of Lake Erie, approximately south of the town of Harrow. Colchester was formerly part of the Township of Colchester South and is now a part of the amalgamated Town of Essex within the County of Essex. Colchester shares its postal code with Harrow as N0R 1G0. Europeans began to settle in Colchester in the 18th century. Many United Empire Loyalists leaving the United States around the time of the American Revolutionary War were given land grants in Colchester. Some of names of these pioneers can still be found today in the names of residents throughout the region including: Snider, Huffman, Ferris, Hutchins, Iler, McCormick, Quick, and Tofflemire. One such Loyalist was John Snider of Pennsylvania. In 1798 Snider was given Lot 82 along the lakefront and built a home for his family just west of the village. As the oldest known structure along Lake Erie's shoreline, the house was completed in 1813 and a letter from the time indicates that men were working on the home's roof as cannons roared during the Battle of Lake Erie. The area was also a destination for slaves escaping the U.S. via the Underground Railroad in the mid-19th century, and for freed slaves during and after the American Civil War. In the 1870s a church was built along Dunn Road by many pioneering blacks, and it was named Zion African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. The church's cemetery still stands today on the western edge of the Road. Colchester was also the birthplace and hometown of railroad engineer and inventor Elijah McCoy, whose 45 patents and the invention of the locomotive lubrication cup led to the slogan \\"The real McCoy\\", denoting quality. Today, in addition to its many lakeside cottages, Colchester is home to several hundred year-round residents who have converted older homes and built new ones. Restaurants, a public beach, and a marina have been an important part of Colchester for some years now. The population is approximately 900. Colchester lies along the southernmost road on mainland Canada, County Road 50, and has recently become a tourist destination because of the nearby wineries, the beach and harbour, and the scenery of the area. Every year, the village plays host to the \\"Colchester Villagefest\\" and \\"Explore the Shore\\", which are aimed at attracting visitors to the venues and attractions along the historic lakefront road. The village is also home to Christ Church Colchester (Anglican) which has a long history dating back to the beginnings of Colchester as a settlement.

The term was developed to reflect a United Kingdom (UK) regulatory position and has a specific UK meaning, although it has been adopted in other parts of the world, such as Hong Kong. The term \\"independent financial adviser\\" was coined to describe the advisers working independently for their clients rather than representing an insurance company, bank or bancassurer. At the time (1988) the UK government was introducing the polarisation regime which forced advisers to either be tied to a single insurer or product provider or to be an independent practitioner. The term is commonly used in the United Kingdom where IFAs are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and must meet strict qualification and competence requirements. Typically an independent financial adviser will conduct a detailed survey of a client’s financial position, preferences and objectives; this is sometimes known as a factfind. The adviser will then recommend appropriate action to meet the client's objectives; and if necessary recommend a suitable financial product to match the client’s needs. Individuals and businesses consult IFAs on many matters including investment, retirement planning, insurance, protection and mortgages (or other loans). IFAs also advise on some tax and legal matters.  New rules for financial advisers in the UK from 2013  From the end of 2012, there will be two types of financial advisor: independent or restricted. IFAs will no longer be allowed to receive commissions from financial services companies on new sales of investments. Instead, they will have to set their own fees, based on the services they offer, and agree with the client on fees before providing any services. Any advice that does not meet this standard must be labelled as restricted. IFAs should also be able to demonstrate to the FCA that they review all the suitable products in a market and that they give fair, unbiased and unrestricted advice. These changes are intended to make their charges more transparent and advice more genuinely independent. However, some banks, building societies and insurance advisers could switch to offering an ‘information only’ (non-advised) service instead, where fees won’t be apparent. Advisers will also be allowed to keep earning it on products they have sold before the end of 2012, and still charge a regular fee if they are providing an ongoing service such as reviewing and advising on a client's investments. Neither do these new rules apply to the sale of cash savings products, general insurance, protection products (term life insurance, critical illness cover, income protection insurance etc.) or mortgages unless they are sold at the same time as a regulated investment product.  Qualifications for IFAs in the UK  To offer financial advice an individual must represent or be an appointed representative of a firm registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA require that firms ensure that individuals acting for them have appropriate qualifications. The list of appropriate qualifications is determined by the Financial Services Skills Council at the behest of the FCA. Up to the end of 2012 all financial advisers only required a qualification at Level 3 or above of the Qualifications and Credit Framework. From the end of 2012, financial advisers will need to be qualified at Level 4 or above. (This is about the same as completing the first year of a university degree.) From the end of 2012, financial advisers will need to obtain an annual Statement of Professional Standing. This statement confirms that the adviser is suitably qualified, that the adviser subscribes to a code of ethics and that the adviser has kept his or her knowledge up-to- date through continuing professional development. Most financial qualifications are assessed under the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF). You will see that these have a QCF grade, from level 1 to level 8. = IFA Network = IFA Network is an association of IFAs. All financial advisers in the UK must either be authorised or exempt under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Membership of an IFA Network qualifies an IFA as being exempt from regulation. The IFA Network is then responsible for the advice and regulatory compliance of its members. Source: Financial Conduct Authority What is an appointed representative? An appointed representative is a firm that conducts regulated business on behalf of a directly FCA-authorised firm, who is its ‘principal’. The principal firm takes regulatory responsibility for the appointed representative, and must ensure it meets FCA requirements.

It lies in the heart of the city's historic center, between the Via dei Coronari and the Tiber River. Its name commemorates the Torre dell'Annona, a mediaeval tower which once stood there and was later converted into one of the city's most important theatres, the Teatro Tordinona, later called the Teatro Apollo. History =Early history= The Torre dell'Annona was a medieval stronghold of the Orsini family and from the early 15th century acted as a pontifical prison. Prisoners included Benevenuto Cellini who experienced the dungeon's lightless cells, one of which was known as \\"the pit\\", Beatrice Cenci, and Giordano Bruno who was imprisoned here before being burned alive in Campo de' Fiori. = Theatre= When the New Prison (Le Carceri Nuove) was built in Via Giulia, Tor di Nona was rebuilt in 1667 as a theatre patronized by Queen Christina of Sweden and the best Roman company. In January 1671 Rome's first public theatre opened in the former jail.Early Music History: Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Music By Iain Fenlon The Teatro Tordinona was inaugurated in January 1671 with the opera Scipione Affricano by Francesco Cavalli, with Antonia Coresi as Scipione and Medea, and Angelica Quadrelli as Sofonisba and Isifile.Zilli, Anna, Drottning Kristinas sångerskor: en omvälvande kraft i Roms musikliv 1655-1689, Nordic Academic Press, Lund, 2019 For the opening Scipione affricano by Francesco Cavalli was performed; also operas by Antonio Sartorio, Giovanni Antonio Boretto and Giovanni Maria Pagliardi. Filippo Acciaiuoli was the first director. The new pope Clement X worried about the influence of theatre on public morals. When Innocent XI became pope, things turned even worse; he made Christina's theatre into a storeroom for grain, although he had been a frequent guest in her royal box with the other cardinals. He forbade women to perform with song or acting, and the wearing of decolleté dresses. Christina considered this sheer nonsense, and let women perform in her palace.Zilli, Anna, Drottning Kristinas sångerskor: en omvälvande kraft i Roms musikliv 1655-1689, Nordic Academic Press, Lund, 2019 There are many perhaps unexecuted drawings for it by Carlo Fontana, bound in an album which passed into the hands of Scottish architect Robert Adam, now at Sir John Soane's Museum, London (Concise Catalogue). The theater suffered the fires and rebuildings that theaters are prone to, and was finally swept away when the embankments of the Tiber (lungoteveri) were built in 1888; this section was named Lungotevere Tor di Nona. Memorial to the Teatro Apollo A free-standing white marble fountain (1925) memorializes the theater in its late-18th century transformation as the Teatro Apollo, with suitable theatrical masks, and a small trickle of water into a massive sarcophagus, in the somewhat theatrical classical style of Vittorio Emmanuele III and Benito Mussolini. As the Teatro Apollo, the largest lyric theater of Rome, the site witnessed the world premieres of two operas of Giuseppe Verdi, Il Trovatore and Un Ballo in Maschera. Now nothing is left of the original tower nor of the theatre but their name, although in the early 1930s a smaller theatre bearing the name Teatro Tordinona was built on the Via degli Acquasparta, near the original site. It remains a going concern, presenting works by Luigi Pirandello and contemporary theater.Teatro Tordinona (official website). \\"Cenni storici\\". Retrieved 28 December 2014 . =Later history= At the end of the 19th century, the neighborhood was partially destroyed because of the construction of the Lungotevere, the alleys bordering the river. The whole north side of the street was pulled down, including buildings like the Teatro Apollo and the palazzo del Cardinale di Parma. Another blow came in the 1910s with the construction of via Zanardelli, which cut the thousand-year link with Via di Monte Brianzo. This accelerated the decay of the quarter, which in the 1940s became part of a development plan as part of the fascist demolition strategy in Rome. As in Borgo and Via Giulia, this work was halted by World War II. During the last years of World War II, the Roman \\"mercato nero\\" (black market) was located in the Tor di Nona quarter. In the postwar years, although the population had already left the quarter, a strong press campaign led by journalists like Antonio Cederna and intellectuals like Italo Insolera and Giulio Carlo Argan saved Tor di Nona from destruction. From that time until the present, the centre of Rome has been protected against further destruction.

It expands on previous versions of the Xbox exclusive games. It has also been noted for taking a more irreverent tone than previous installments, such as the inclusion of challenges in which two players compete to amass the most injuries, and for its unique cut-scenes using different visual media, from hand puppets to anime. Gameplay Amped 3 features several ski resorts with a variety of challenges in addition to the main story. Completing these challenges earns the player respect points and money. In addition, certain challenges unlock new clothing, gear, tricks, and music. These challenges include media call-outs that require the player to perform a certain type of trick, timed runs, sled and snowmobile challenges, races that require the player to collect a certain number of objects within a set time, and challenges that require the player to beat a professional snowboarder. Gaining respect points allows the player to unlock new areas of the mountain and advance the main story. The game has a single-player story mode, while having 2-player minigames throughout. No online content or play, other than a high-score leaderboard, is available. Plot The story begins at Northstar at Tahoe, with the main character \\"Player 1\\" dressed in a pink bunny suit heading up the mountain with friends Wienerboy, Sebastian, J Dawg, and Hunter. Player 1 snowboards down the mountain and takes a big drop off of a cliff. Once there, Player 1 meets Dandelion, a snow goddess with a passion for scrap-booking. From here, you can choose Player 1's gender and appearance. As the story progresses, it is revealed that Player 1 and his crew are saving up for a vacation to a ski resort in Chile. After completing several training challenges, Player 1 and his crew participate in an Easter Egg Roll to earn more money for their vacation fund. After saving Wienerboy from a trio of mysterious thugs, the player follows them to see what they are up to. During the chase J Dawg confronts Player 1 and accuses him of stealing the vacation money from Hunter's locker. The rest of the crew heads to Chile, while Player 1 tries to earn money to replace the stolen funds. As the story moves to Snowbird, Player 1 accepts several jobs for a marketing company. These jobs require the player to perform several dangerous stunts. After the marketing company decides to relocate, Player 1 meets up with his friend Roman who suggests he try out for the ski patrol. After making some more money, Roman sets up Player 1 with a new job: taking pictures of celebrity Berlin Sheridan on her snowboard trip. Player 1 manages to avoid Sheridan's bodyguards and makes enough money to replace the stolen vacation fund. The story cuts to a news report of a comet on a collision course with Earth. Another reporter cuts in to share Player 1's photos of Berlin Sheridan in embarrassing positions during her trip. Player 1 makes it to Valle Nevado and sets out to investigate what happened to his friends. He finds out they were selected for sponsorship by a company called Colonotronic Arts Inc. Player 1 reunites with Wienerboy first and finds out he was rejected by C.A.I. Next, he meets up with Sebastian who was sent by H.R. to assist in Player 1's “re-orientation.” Player 1 destroys Sebastian's laptop (which has a red eye similar to HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey). This breaks C.A.I.’s influence over him. Sebastian directs Player 1 to Laax Resort where Hunter has been sent to recruit more minions for Colonotronic Arts. The cut-scenes reveal that a villain named Baron von Havoc is behind this, as he seeks to create a game called Emag Live. Upon arriving at Laax, Player 1 confronts Hunter and beats her in two snowboarding challenges. The crew discovers that J Dawg has been made a part of a boy band whose music contains subliminal messages. Player 1 manages to stop J Dawg’s concert before it broadcasts its message around the world. Once J Dawg has been rescued the crew meets up with Dandelion again. She informs them that she was the one who stole their vacation fund and framed Player 1 for it so the crew would be split up and wouldn’t fall under Baron von Havoc’s mind control. The crew makes their way to Baron von Havoc’s zeppelin and stops his plan. The game ends with a musical number featuring the main characters in the story. At the song’s conclusion the comet hits the Earth and destroys everything. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

The economic depression of the Special Period was at its most severe in the early to mid-1990s, before slightly declining in severity towards the end of the decade once Hugo Chávez's Venezuela emerged as Cuba's primary trading partner and diplomatic ally, and especially after the year 2000 once Cuba–Russia relations improved under the presidency of Vladimir Putin. It was defined primarily by extreme reductions of rationed foods at state-subsidized prices, the severe shortages of hydrocarbon energy resources in the form of gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum derivatives that occurred upon the implosion of economic agreements between the petroleum-rich Soviet Union and Cuba, and the shrinking of an economy overdependent on Soviet imports. The period radically transformed Cuban society and the economy, as it necessitated the introduction of organic agriculture, decreased use of automobiles, and overhauled industry, health, and diet countrywide. People were forced to live without many goods and services that had been available since the beginning of the 20th century. Overview Cuban oil production and consumption The shortage of sugar and the loss of trade from the former Soviet Union nations hit the Cuban economy severely. The country lost approximately 80% of its imports, 80% of its exports and its Gross Domestic Product dropped by 34%. Food and medicine imports stopped or severely slowed. The largest immediate impact was the loss of nearly all of the petroleum imports from the USSR; Cuba's oil imports dropped to 10% of pre-1990 amounts. Before this, Cuba had been re-exporting any Soviet petroleum it did not consume to other nations for profit, meaning that petroleum had been Cuba's second largest export product before 1990. Once the restored Russian Federation emerged from the former Soviet Union, its administration immediately made clear that it had no intention of delivering petroleum that had been guaranteed the island by the USSR; this resulted in a decrease in Cuban consumption by 20% of its previous level within two years. The effect was felt immediately. Entirely dependent on fossil fuels to operate, the major underpinnings of Cuban society—its transport, industrial and agricultural systems—were paralyzed. There were extensive losses of productivity in both Cuban agriculture—which was dominated by modern industrial tractors, combines, and harvesters, all of which required petroleum to run—and in Cuban industrial capacity. The early stages of the Special Period were defined by a general breakdown in transportation and agricultural sectors, fertilizer and pesticide stocks (both of those being manufactured primarily from petroleum derivatives), and widespread food shortages. Australian and other permaculturists arriving in Cuba at the time began to distribute aid and taught their techniques to locals, who soon implemented them in Cuban fields, raised beds, and urban rooftops across the nation. Organic agriculture was soon after mandated by the Cuban government, supplanting the old industrialized form of agriculture Cubans had grown accustomed to. Relocalization, permaculture, and innovative modes of mass transit had to be rapidly developed. For a time, waiting for a bus could take three hours, power outages could last up to sixteen hours, food consumption was cut back to one-fifth of its previous level and the average Cuban lost about nine kilograms (twenty pounds). Although starvation was avoided, persistent hunger, something not seen since before the Cuban Revolution, suddenly became a daily experience, and initially, malnutrition in children under five was evident after just a few weeks of these food shortages. At the time, United States law allowed humanitarian aid in the form of food and medicine by private groups. Then in March 1996, the Helms-Burton Act imposed further penalties on foreign companies doing business in Cuba, and allowed U.S. citizens to sue foreign investors who use American-owned property seized by the Cuban government. The Cuban government was also forced to contract out more lucrative economic and tourism deals with various Western European and South American nations in an attempt to earn the foreign currency necessary to replace the lost Soviet petroleum via the international markets. Additionally faced with a near-elimination of imported steel and other ore-based supplies, Cuba closed refineries and factories across the country, eliminating the country's industrial arm and millions of jobs. The government then proceeded to replace these lost jobs with employment in industrial agriculture and other homegrown initiatives, but these jobs often did not pay as well, and Cubans on the whole became economically poorer. Alternative transport, most notably the Cuban \\"camels\\"—immense 18-wheeler tractor trailers retrofitted as passenger buses meant to carry hundreds of Cubans each—flourished. Food-wise, meat and dairy products, having been extremely fossil fuel dependent in their former factory farming methods, soon diminished in the Cuban diet. In a shift notable for being generally anathema to Latin American food habits, the people of the island by necessity adopted diets higher in fiber, fresh produce, and ultimately more vegan in character. No longer needing sugar as desperately for a cash crop—the oil-for-sugar program the Soviets had contracted with Cuba had, of course, dissipated—Cuba hurriedly diversified its agricultural production, utilizing former cane fields to grow consumables such as oranges and other fruit and vegetables. The Cuban government also focused more intensely on cooperation with Venezuela once the socialist Hugo Chávez was elected president in 1998. =Famine= Cubans had to resort to eating anything they could find. Garth, Hanna. 2009 Things Became Scarce: Food Availability and Accessibility in Santiago de Cuba Then and Now. NAPA Bulletin. In the Havana zoo, \\"The peacocks, the buffalo and even the rhea\\" were reported to have disappeared. Cuban domestic cats disappeared from streets to dinner tables. Cows on the island were eaten. Before 1959, Cuba boasted as many cattle as people. Today meat is so scarce that it is a crime to kill and eat a cow. To combat illegal cow eating, the government established harsh penalties. A person can get more jail time for killing a cow (10 years in prison) than killing a human. Those who sell beef without government permission can get three to eight years in prison. Eaters of illegal beef can get three months to one year in prison. The Special Period's malnutrition created epidemics, but it had positive effects too. Manuel Franco describes the Special Period as \\"the first, and probably the only, natural experiment, born of unfortunate circumstances, where large effects on diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality have been related to sustained population-wide weight loss as a result of increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake\\". A paper in the American Journal of Epidemiology, says that \\"during 1997–2002, there were declines in deaths attributed to diabetes (51%), coronary heart disease (35%), stroke (20%), and all causes (18%). An outbreak of neuropathy and a modest increase in the all- cause death rate among the elderly were also observed.\\" This was caused by how the population tried to reduce the energy store without reducing the nutritional value of the food. A letter published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) criticized the American Journal of Epidemiology for not taking all factors into account and says that \\"The famine in Cuba during the Special Period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a famine in North Korea in the mid-1990s. Both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled when the public food distribution collapsed; priority was given to the elite classes and the military. In North Korea, 3%–5% of the population died; in Cuba the death rate among the elderly increased by 20% from 1982 to 1993.\\" All editorial matter in CMAJ represents the opinions of the authors and not necessarily those of the Canadian Medical Association or its subsidiaries. In this article the author's name has been withheld in order to safeguard her or his right to free communication. The regime did not accept American donations of food, medicines and cash until 1993. Thirty thousand Cubans fled the country; thousands drowned or were killed by sharks.\\" Nutrition fell from per day in 1989 to per day in 1993. Other reports indicate even lower figures, per day. Some estimated that the very old and children received only per day. The recommended minimum is between , depending on age, sex, and activity levels. Effects =1994 protest= Hundreds of Cubans protested in Havana on August 5, 1994, some chanting \\"\\" (\\"Freedom\\"). The protest, in which some protesters threw rocks at police, was dispersed by the police after a few hours. A paper published in the Journal of Democracy argued that this was the closest that the Cuban opposition could come to asserting itself decisively. =Energy crisis= Immediate actions taken by the government included televising an announcement of the expected energy crisis a week before the USSR notified the Cuban government that they would not be delivering the expected quota of crude oil. Citizens were asked to reduce their consumption in all areas and to use public transport and carpooling. As time went on, the administration developed more structured strategies to manage the long-term energy/economic crisis as it stretched into the 21st century. =Food rationing= Food rationing intensified. Monthly allocations for families were based on basic minimum requirements as recommended by the United Nations. = Housing, land distribution, and urban planning = The cost of producing cement and the scarcity of tools and of building materials increased the pressure on already overcrowded housing. Even before the energy crisis, extended families lived in small apartments (many of which were in very poor condition) to be closer to an urban area. To help alleviate this situation, the government engaged in land-distribution where they supplemented larger government-owned farms with privately owned ones. Small homes were built in rural areas and land was provided to encourage families to move, to assist in food production for themselves, and to sell in local farmers' markets. As the film The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil discusses, co-ops developed which were owned and managed by groups, as well as creating opportunities for allowing them to form \\"service co-ops\\" where credit was exchanged and group purchasing-power was used to buy seeds and other scarce items.The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil =Transportation= File:El Camello.jpgThe \\"camel\\" (called this because of its two \\"humps\\") bus-trailers were introduced during the period.

File:Bicicleta de Tres Cuba.jpgA family of three sharing a bicycle in 1994. Cubans were accustomed to cars as a convenient mode of transport. It was a difficult shift during the Special Period to adjust to a new way of managing the transport of thousands of people to school, to work and to other daily activities. With the realization that food was the key to survival, transport became a secondary worry and walking, hitch-hiking, and carpooling became the norm. Privately owned vehicles are not common; ownership is not seen as a right but as a privilege awarded for performance. Public transport is creative and takes on the following forms: * Cars – old US cars common in Cuba are used as taxis to transport from six to eight passengers, stopping at locations as needed. * Trucks – canopies and steps were added to accommodate more passengers and protect them from the natural elements; or open \\"dump-truck buses\\" are used. * Bikes – 1.2 million bicycles were purchased from China and distributed as well as another half a million produced in Cuba. * \\"Camels\\" – Conversion of semi- truck flatbeds into bus-like vehicles that hold up to 300 passengers. * Government vehicles pick up passengers as needed. * Horses and mules are used as well as bike- and horse-drawn carriages with taxi licenses are numerous both in rural and urban areas. * Convenience for the individual is secondary to efficient use of energy. =Agriculture= Cuba's history of colonization included deforestation and overuse of its agricultural land. Before the crisis, Cuba used more pesticides than the U.S. Lack of fertilizer and agricultural machinery caused a shift towards organic farming and urban farming. Cuba still has food rationing for basic staples. Approximately 69% of these rationed basic staples (wheat, vegetable oils, rice, etc.) are imported. Overall, however, approximately 16% of food is imported from abroad. Initially, this was a very difficult situation for Cubans to accept; many came home from studying abroad to find that there were no jobs in their fields. It was pure survival that motivated them to continue and contribute to survive through this crisis. The documentary, The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil, states that today, farmers make more money than most other occupations. Due to a poor economy, there were many crumbling buildings that could not be repaired. These were torn down and the empty lots lay idle for years until the food shortages forced Cuban citizens to make use of every piece of land. Initially, this was an ad-hoc process where ordinary Cubans took the initiative to grow their own food in any available piece of land. The government encouraged this practice and later assisted in promoting it. Urban gardens sprung up throughout the capital of Havana and other urban centers on roof-tops, patios, and unused parking lots in raised beds as well as \\"squatting\\" on empty lots. These efforts were furthered by Australian agriculturalists who came to the island in 1993 to teach permaculture, a sustainable agricultural system, and to \\"train the trainers\\". The Cuban government then sent teams throughout the country to train others. Downtown Havana kiosks provided advice and resources for individual residents. Widespread farmers' markets gave easy access to locally grown produce; less travel time required less energy use.Around the World in 80 Gardens =Cuban culture= Trinidad, Cuba, in 2006 The ideological changes of the Special Period had effects on Cuban society and culture, beyond those on the country. A comprehensive review of these effects concerning ideology, art and popular culture can be found in Ariana Hernandez-Reguant's Cuba in the Special Period. As a result of increased travel and tourism, popular culture developed in new ways. Lisa Knauer, in that volume, describes the circulation of rumba between New York and Havana, and their mutual influences. Antonio Eligio Tonel has described the contemporary art networks that shaped the Cuban art market, and Esther Whitfield the channels through which Cuban literature accessed the wider Spanish speaking world during that period. Elsewhere, Deborah Pacini, Marc Perry, Geoffrey Baker and Sujatha Fernandes extensively wrote about Cuban rap music as a result of these transnational exchanges. In recent years, that is, not in the 1990s which is the period identified with the Special Period, reggaeton has replaced timba as the genre of choice among youth, taking on the explicitly sexual dance moves that originated with timba.Hernandez-Reguant, Ariana. \\"A Macho Sound for Black Sex.\\" in Kamari Clarke and Deborah Thomas, Globalization and Race, Duke University Press. Fairley, Jan. \\"'Como hacer el amor con ropa' (As making love with your clothes on): Dancing regeton and hip- hop in Cuba.\\" In Reading Reggaeton (forthcoming, Duke University Press), 2. Whereas timba music was a Cuban genre that evolved out of traditional song and jazz, emphasizing blackness and sexuality through sensual dancing, with lyrics that reflected the socio-cultural situation of the period with humor [Hernandez-Reguant 2006]. Cuban hip hop evolved as a socially conscious movement influenced heavily by its kin genre American hip-hop. Thus it was not so much a product of the Special Period—as timba was—as one of globalization [Fernandes 2004]. The Revolution and the blockage of all imports from the US had made the dissemination of American music difficult during the sixties and seventies, as it was often \\"tainted as music of the enemy and began to disappear from the public view.\\" But all of that changed in the 1990s, when American rappers flocked regularly to Cuba, tourists brought CDs, and North American stations, perfectly audible in Cuba, brought its sounds. Nonetheless, hip hop circulated through informal networks, thus creating a small underground scene of rap enthusiasts located mostly in Havana's Eastern neighborhoods that called the attention of foreign scholars and journalists. Eventually, rappers were offered a space within state cultural networks. The lack of resources to purchase the electronic equipment to produce beats and tracks gives Cuban rap a raw feel that paralleled that of \\"old school\\" music in the US.Pacini-Hernandez, Deborah and Reebee Garofalo. \\"The emergence of rap Cubano: An historical perspective.\\" In Music, Space, and Place, editors Whitely, Bennett, and Hawkins, 89–107.

The theory was proposed by Judee K. Burgoon in the late 1970s and continued through the 1980s and 1990s as \\"nonverbal expectancy violations theory\\", based on Burgoon's research studying proxemics. In J. Blumler, K. E. Rosengren, & J. M. McLeod (Eds.), Comparatively speaking: Communication and culture across space and time (pp. 53–69). Newbury Park, CA: Sage Burgoon's work initially analyzed individuals' allowances and expectations of personal distance and how responses to personal distance violations were influenced by the level of liking and relationship to the violators. The theory was later changed to its current name when other researchers began to focus on violations of social behavior expectations beyond nonverbal communication. This theory sees communication as an exchange of behaviors, where one individual's behavior can be used to violate the expectations of another. Participants in communication will perceive the exchange either positively or negatively, depending upon an existing personal relationship or how favorably the violation is perceived. Violations of expectancies cause arousal and compel the recipient to initiate a series of cognitive appraisals of the violation. The theory predicts that expectancies influence the outcome of the communication interaction as either positive or negative and predicts that positive violations increase the attraction of the violator and negative violations decrease the attraction of the violator. Beyond proxemics and examining how people interpret violations in many given communicative contexts, EVT also makes specific predictions about individuals' reaction to given expectation violations: individuals reciprocate or match someone's unexpected behavior, and they also compensate or counteract by doing the opposite of the communicator's behavior.  Components  The EVT examines three main components in interpersonal communication situations: Expectancies, communicator reward valence, and violation valence. = Expectancy = Expectancy refers to what an individual anticipates will happen in a given situation. Expectancies are primarily based upon social norms and specific characteristics and idiosyncrasies of the communicators. Burgoon (1978) notes that people do not view others' behaviors as random. Rather, they have various expectations of how others should think and behave. EVT proposes that observation and interaction with others leads to expectancies. The two types of expectancies noted are predictive and prescriptive. Predictive expectations are \\"behaviors we expect to see because they are the most typical,\\" (Houser, 2005) and vary across cultures. They let people know what to expect based upon what typically occurs within the context of a particular environment and relationship. For example, a husband and wife may have an evening routine in which the husband always washes the dishes. If he were to ignore the dirty dishes one night, this might be seen as a predictive discrepancy. Prescriptive expectations, on the other hand, are based upon \\"beliefs about what behaviors should be performed\\" and \\"what is needed and desired\\" (Houser, 2005). If a person walks into a police department to report a crime, the person will have an expectation that the police will file a report and follow up with an investigation. When the theory was first proposed, EVT identified three factors which influence a person's expectations: Interactant variables, environmental variables, and variables related to the nature of the interaction. Interactant variables are the traits of those persons involved in the communication, such as sex, attractiveness, race, culture, status, and age. Environmental variables include the amount of space available and the nature of the territory surrounding the interaction. Interaction variables include social norms, purpose of the interaction, and formality of the situation. These factors later evolved into communicator characteristics, relational characteristics, and context. Communicator characteristics include personal features such as an individual's appearance, personality and communication style. It also includes factors such as age, sex and ethnic background. Relational characteristics refer to factors such as similarity, familiarity, status and liking. The type of relationship one individual shares within another (e.g. romantic, business or platonic), the previous experiences shared between the individuals, and how close they are with one another are also relational characteristics that influence expectations. Context encompasses both environment and interaction characteristics. Communicator characteristics lead to distinctions between males and females in assessing the extent to which their nonverbal expressions of power and dominance effect immediacy behaviors. Immediacy cues such as conversational distance, lean, body orientation, gaze, and touch may differ between the genders as they create psychological closeness or distance between the interactants. Behavioural expectations may also shift depending on the environment one is experiencing. For example, a visit to a church will produce different expectations than a social function. The expected violations will therefore be altered. Similarly, expectations differ based on culture. In Europe, one may expect to be greeted with three kisses on alternating cheeks, but this is not the case in the United States. Harvard Business School Working Paper, No. 10-048. = Communicator reward valence = The communicator reward valence is an evaluation one makes about the person who committed a violation of expectancy. Em Griffin summarizes the concept behind Communicator Reward Valence as \\"the sum of positive and negative attributes brought to the encounter plus the potential to reward or punish in the future\\". The social exchange theory explains that individuals seek to reward some and seek to avoid punishing others. When one individual interacts with another, Burgoon believes he or she will assess the \\"positive and negative attributes that person brings to the encounter\\". If the person has the ability to reward or punish the receiver in the future, then the person has a positive reward valence. Rewards simply refer to the person's ability to provide a want or need. The term 'communicator reward valence' is used to describe the results of this assessment. For example, people will feel encouraged during conversation when the listener is nodding, making eye contact, and responding actively. Conversely, if the listener is avoiding eye contact, yawning, and texting, it is implied they have no interest in the interaction and the speaker may feel violated. When examining the context, relationship, and communicator's characteristics in a given encounter, individuals will arrive at an expectation for how that person should behave. Changing even one of these expectancy variables may lead to a different expectation. = Violation valence = Behavior violations arouse and distract, calling attention to the qualities of the violator and the relationship between the interactants. A key component of EVT is the notion of violation valence, or the association the receiver places on the behavior violation. A violatee's response to an expectancy violation can be positive or negative, and is dependent on two conditions: positive or negative interpretation of the behavior and the nature (rewardingness) of the violator. Rewardingness of the violator is evaluated through many categories – attractiveness, prestige, ability to provide resources, or associated relationship. For instance, a violation of one's personal distance might have more positive valence if committed by a wealthy, powerful, physically appealing member of the opposite sex than a filthy, poor, homeless person with foul breath. The evaluation of the violation is based upon the relationship between the particular behavior and the valence of the actor. A person's preinteractional expectancies, especially personal attributes, may cause a perceiver to evaluate the communication behavior of a target differently in terms of assigning positive and negative valenced expectancies. Another perspective of violation valence is that the perceived positive or negative value assigned to a breach of expectations is inconsequential of who the violator is. This perspective places much greater weight on the act of the breach itself than the violator. = Arousal = Expectancy violations refer to actions which are noticeably discrepant from an expectancy and are classified as outside the range of expectancy. The term 'arousal value' is used to describe the consequences of deviations from expectations. When individuals' expectations are violated, their interests or attentions are aroused. When arousal occurs, one's interest or attention to the deviation increases, resulting in less attention paid to the message and more attention to the source of the arousal. There are two kinds of arousals. Cognitive arousal is an idea that people will be mentally aware of the violation. Physical occurs when people have body actions and behaviors in response to the deviations from their expectations. = Threat threshold = The occurrence of arousal is aligned with threats. Burgoon introduced the term \\"threat threshold\\" to explain that people have different levels of tolerance about distant violations. The threat threshold is high when people feel good even if they keep a very close distance with the violator, whereas people with low threat threshold will be sensitive and uncomfortable about the closeness of distance with the violator.  Theoretical assumptions and viewpoints  = Propositions = After assessing expectancy, violation valence, and communicator reward valence of a given situation, it becomes possible to make rather specific predictions about whether the individual who perceived the violation will reciprocate or compensate the behavior in question. Guerrero (1996) and Burgoon (2000) noticed that predictable patterns develop when considering reward valence and violation valence together. Specifically, if the violation valence is perceived as positive and the communicator reward valence is also perceived as positive, the theory predicts individuals will reciprocate the positive behavior. Similarly, if one perceives the violation valence as negative and the communicator reward valence as negative, the theory again predicts that one will reciprocate the negative behavior. Thus, if a disliked coworker is grouchy and unpleasant, people will likely reciprocate and be unpleasant in return. Conversely, if one perceives a negative violation valence but views the communicator reward valence as positive, it is likely that the person will compensate for his or her partner's negative behavior. For example, imagine a supervisor appears sullen and throws a stack of papers in front of an employee. Rather than grunt back, EVT predicts that the employee will compensate for the boss's negativity, perhaps by asking if everything is OK (Guerrero & Burgoon, 1996). More difficult to predict, however, is the situation in which a person who is viewed unfavorably violates another with positive behavior. In this situation, the receiver may reciprocate, giving the person the \\"benefit of the doubt.\\" The assumptions discussed thus far can be summarized into six major propositions posited by EVT:Burgoon, J. K., Stern L. A., & Dillman, L. (1995). Interpersonal adaptation. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. # People develop expectations about verbal and nonverbal communication behavior from other people. # Violations of these expectations cause arousal and distraction, further leading the receiver to shift his or her attention to the other, the relationship, and the meaning of the violation. # Communicator reward valence determines the interpretation of ambiguous communication. # Communicator reward valence determines how the behavior is evaluated. # Violation valences are determined by three factors: (1) The evaluation of the behavior; (2) whether or not the behavior is more or less favorable than the expectation; and (3) the magnitude of the violation. A positive violation occurs when the behavior is more favorable than the expectation. A negative violation occurs when the behavior is less favorable. # Positive violations produce more favorable outcomes than behavior that matches expectations, and negative violations produce more unfavorable outcomes than behavior that matches expectations. = Needs for personal space and affiliation = EVT builds upon a number of communication axioms. EVT assumes that humans have two competing needs: A need for personal space and a need for affiliation. Specifically, humans all need a certain amount of personal space, also referred to as distance or privacy. People also desire a certain amount of closeness with others, or affiliation. EVT seeks to explain 'personal space', and the meanings that are formed when expectations of appropriate personal space are infringed or violated. Another feature of personal space is territoriality. Territoriality refers to behavior which \\"is characterized by identification with a geographic area in a way that indicates ownership\\" (Hall, 1966). In humans, territoriality refers to an individual's sense of ownership over physical items, space, objects or ideas, and defensive behavior in response to territorial invasions. Territoriality involves three territory types: Primary territories, secondary territories and public territories. Primary territories are considered exclusive to an individual. Secondary territories are objects, spaces or places which \\"can be claimed temporarily\\" (Hall, 1966), but are neither central to the individual's life nor are exclusively owned. Public territories are \\"available to almost anyone for temporary ownership\\". Territoriality is frequently accompanied by prevention and reaction. When an individual perceives one of their needs has been compromised, EVT predicts that they will react. For instance, when an offensive violation occurs, the individual tends to react as though protecting their territory. = Proxemics = EVT offers an opportunity to study how individuals communicate through personal space. This part of the theory explains the notion of \\"personal space\\" and our reactions to others who appear to \\"violate\\" our sense of personal space. What we define as personal space, however, varies from culture to culture and from person to person. The \\"success\\" or \\"failure\\" of violations are linked to perceived attraction, credibility, influence and involvement. The context and purpose of interaction are relevant, as are the communicator characteristics of gender, relationships, status, social class, ethnicity and culture. When it comes to different interactions between people, what each person expects out of the interaction will influence their individual willingness to risk violation. If a person feels comfortable in a situation, they are more likely to risk violation, and in turn will be rewarded for it. Introduced by Edward Hall in 1966, Proxemics deals with the amount of distance between people as they interact with one another. Spatial distance during an interaction can be an indication of what type of relationship exists between the people involved. thumb Personal Space Expectations diagram There are 4 different personal zones defined by Hall. These zones include: # Intimate Distance: (0-18 inches) - This distance is for close, intimate encounters. Normally core family, close friends, lovers, or pets. People will normally share a unique level of comfort with one another. # Personal Distance: (18 inches – 4 feet) - Reserved for conversations with friends, extended family, associates, and group discussions. The personal distance will give each person more space compared with the intimate distance, but is still close enough to involve touching one another. # Social Distance: (4–10 feet) - This distance is reserved for newly formed groups, and new acquaintances and colleagues one may have just met. People generally do not engage physically with one another within this section. # Public Distance: (10 feet to infinity) - Reserved for a public setting with large audiences, strangers, speeches, and theaters. Many different cultures are influenced by Proxemics in different ways and respond differently to the same situation. In some cultures, those who have not formed close relationships may greet each other with kisses on the cheek, engaging one another well within the intimate range of proxemics. In other cultures, a custom greeting is a handshake which maintains a physical separation but is well within personal distance. Across the Proxemic Zones, actions can be interpreted differently among different cultures. For example, Japanese people do not address others by their first names unless they have been given permission. Calling someone by their first name in Japan without permission is considered an insult. In the Japanese culture, they address people using their last name and 'san', which is equivalent to 'Mr.','Mrs.' and 'Ms.' in the English language. The way Japanese people address each other is an example of a verbal Proxemic zone. A Japanese person allowing another to call them by their first name is an example of intimate distance, because this is a privilege extended only someone very close to them.  Applications  = Interpersonal communication = It is important to note that EVT can apply to both non-relational interaction and close relationships. In 1998, more than twenty years after the theory was first published, several studies were conducted to catalog the types of expectancy violations commonly found in close relationships. Participants in friendships and romantic relationships were asked to think about the last time their friend or partner did or said something unexpected. It was emphasized that the unexpected event could be either positive or negative. Participants reported events that had occurred, on average, five days earlier, suggesting that unexpected behaviors happen often in relationships. Some of the behaviors reported were relatively mundane, and others were quite serious. The outcome of the list was a list of nine general categories of expectation violations that commonly occur in relationships. # Support or confirmation is an act that provides social support in a particular time of need, such as sitting with a friend who is sick. # Criticism or accusation is critical of the receiver and accuse the individual of an offense. These are violations because they are accusations not expected. An example is a ball player telling a teammate he should have caught the ball rather than supportively giving him or her a slap on the back and offering words of encouragement. # Relationship intensification or escalation intensifies the commitment of the communicator. For instance, saying \\"I love you\\" signifies a deepening of a romantic relationship. # Relationship de-escalation signifies a decrease in commitment of the communicator. An example might be spending more time apart. # Relational transgressions are violations of the perceived rules of the relationship. Examples include having an affair, deception, or being disloyal. # Acts of devotion are unexpected overtures that imply specialness in the relationship. Buying flowers for no particular occasion falls into this category. # Acts of disregard show that the partner is unimportant. This could be as simple as excluding a partner or a friend from a collective activity. # Gestures of inclusion are actions that show an unexpected interest in having the other included in special activities or life. Examples include invitations to spend a special holiday with someone, disclosure of personal information, or inviting the partner to meet one's family. # Uncharacteristic relational behavior is unexpected action that is not consistent with the partner's perception of the relationship. A common example is one member of an opposite- sex friendship demanding a romantic relationship of the other. In later review of the studies, the support or confirmation category was inserted into acts of devotion and included another category, uncharacteristic social behavior. These are acts that aren't relational but are unexpected, such as a quiet person raising his or her voice.Guerrero, L. K., Andersen, P. A., & Afifi, W. A. (2001). Close Encounters: Communicating Relationships. New York: McGraw- Hill. In terms of the response to expectancy violations, the sensitivity of expectancy violations varies from genders. Research found that women are less tolerant than men when their expectation are violated by negative behaviors, regardless of the types of violations such as dishonesty and immorality.  Friendship  Expectations with friends formulate over time and are usually brought together by a series of observations of behavior and predictions on how that friend will act in the future. When these expectations are violated, it often can be damaging and dangerous for a close friendship. It can cause an end to the friendship and bring a strong negative experience in that person's life. After time and experiences with that friend we might suspect them to act consistently around me in the way they have always acted, that is until a violation to this expectation takes place. For example, when they begin “breaking promises or even acting in an inauthentic manner to impress others, can have aversive consequences for close relationships” (Cohen 2010). The fact is, we expect our friends to act in a social manner where they are adhere to all of our personal rules we set in our minds. That includes being nice, kind, considerate, and refraining from any comment that puts another down. This is a part of the personal rules we set within ourselves with a personal friendship, that is until we are in a different setting with that individual and they are around different people and the rules are broken. While this might be an offense in one's eyes, it may not be offensive in the others. Each negative experience can deteriorate the relationship and allow more experiences where expectations are continually violated until the relationship is dissolved. Cohen said “the more that a friendship is voluntary, easily replaceable, and disconnected from external pressures to continue, the more vulnerable it is to expectancy violation damage” (Cohen, 2010). Someone will always look for the better option if a negative experience has taken place. The more invested someone is in a friendship, the stronger the effect will have on the individual when expectations are violated. There is also an interesting perspective of expectation violation when gender is considered. Friendships with members of the same sex usually have a completely different feel to the relationship than friendships with members of the opposite sex. Women are generally less tolerant with members of the opposite sex when violations have taken place. Relationships over time, whether it be with the same sex or not, tend to fail when the other will fall away from the behaviors and norms that the other is used to. This can be shown with hostile attitudes, sharp comments, distancing away from the other, etc. Both parties are also capable of violating each other's expectations at the same time. It is not just one person in the relationship that perceives behavior as unusual. One can respond to a violation with another social violation, leaving the friendship in confusion of direction it is going.  Family Relationships: Phubbing  Expectations in family relationships are prone to being violated via phubbing. Phubbing is a term coined to describe when individuals are interacting in physical proximity with one another, however they end up going on their phone, and mentally remove themselves from the conversation and physical reality. This violates expectations in family relationships when a younger individual is around an older adult. Travis Kadylak's article “An investigation of perceived family phubbing expectancy violations and well-being among U.S older adults” reveals that “older adults feel ignored and disrespected” in situations where a younger family is phubbing. In this case, the younger individually unconsciously violate the older adult's expectations—that stems from the adult's perception of social etiquette. Kadylak then call for further research in the future on how phubbing expectancy violations affect the well- being of older adults.  Romantic relationships  Application in interpersonal relationships-romantic relationships Expectancy violations happen frequently in romantic relationships. In relationships there is an unspoken expectation when interacting and that is the significant other will give their full undivided attention when in the presence of their significant other. As the new generation evolves we can see the face to face contact has changed. Unfortunately, with the access use of phones and social media the attention of individuals has shifted to their devices and continues to become worse. With the access to many mobile devices there has been an increase of lack of communication face to face. This has made it difficult for some relationships to grow and or has created conflict because the expectation of attention has been shifted. \\"Individuals expect conversational partners to be moderately involved in an interaction (Burgoon, Newton, Walther, & Baesler, 1989). Within existing relationships, partners rely on one another to show interest and immediacy in interactions (White, 2008). However, the presence of cell phones and the expectation to be constantly available (Ling, 2012) impacts partners' abilities to give full attention to one another\\" (Miller- Ott, A., & Kelly, L. 2015). Regardless of where the romantic relationship takes place, people are likely to have negative valence about cell phone usage if their demand of attention and intimacy are violated. The negative behaviors include texting, viewing news and playing games. In addition, large quantity of annoying cell phone usage during the date has great impact on romantic partner's negative valence towards the violated behaviors. However, Miller-Ott and Kelly found that small amount of cell phone usage during date is acceptable, such as responding to a text message and quickly bringing attentiveness back to the date partner. The same behavior in different occasions and contexts is viewed differently in terms of the degree of valence. Research found that same behavior is viewed as more negative in a restaurant than at home. Since people are more likely to have higher expectations for undivided attention during formal contexts, using cell phone in formal dates will more negatively violate partner's expectations. Divided attention is acceptable in casual contexts – therefore, the degree of expectancy violations is low under a hanging out context. After expectation are violated in the romantic relationships, one may assume that an apology may fix expectations that were violated, however that is not the case, in the article “ Apologies, Expectations, and Violations: An Analysis of Confirmed and Disconfirmed Expectations for Responses to Apologies” Benjamin W Chiles and Michael E. Roloff found that “apology is positively evaluated by apologizers, this relationship is moderated by their expectations of acceptance prior to the actual response to the apology”. In the article “Forgiveness and forgiving communication in dating relationships: An expectancy-investment explanation” Laura K. Guerrero and Guy F. Bachman found that high quality relationships tend to forgive more than relationships with less investments, they tend to inflict hurt intentionally. = Cell phone usage = Cell phone usage behaviors that do not contradict intimate moment are viewed as positive violations, including sharing interesting messages and playing online games together. People have less negative valence on cell phone usage if they gain more reward from the behaviors. Research also found the most common response to the violated cell phone usage is to do nothing. However, people have different reactions to the violations under different stages of romantic relationships. In the early stage of dating, people are more likely to respond by indirect messages and silence. While there are direct verbal responses when expectations are violated in established relationships. = Sexual resistance = Sexual resistance is viewed as a typical expectancy violation in romantic relationships. In 2003, Bevan used EVT to evaluate the impact of sexual resistance on close relationships. The research focused on two considerations: relational contexts and directness of the messages. The research concluded that people who are resisted in a romantic relationship perceived the violation of sexual resistance as more negative and unexpected than those resisted in a regular cross-sex friendship. The reason might because romantic partners believe that they have clearer and deeper understanding of each other's expectations and degree of acceptance and tolerance. When it comes to message directness of sexual resistance, although the study did not find any significant difference of levels of violation valence and expectedness between direct and indirect messages, direct sexual resistance messages in close relationships proved to be more relationally important than indirect messages. Therefore, direct sexual resistance messages will be a harmful factor that affects the continuity of a romantic relationship. =Expectancy Violation Theory in Romantic Relationships: Hurtful Events= The degree of expectancy violations in romantic relationships quality affect how partners react to hurtful events caused by their partner. Partners who view their significant others as positively rewarding are more keen to use constructive communication after experiencing a negative hurtful event. EVT analysis approach also show that if the negative valence happens when partners find the other to be unrewarding, it results in destructive communication, leading to breakups. = Computer-mediated communication and social media = As has previously been addressed, EVT has evolved tremendously over the years, expanding beyond its original induction when it focused on FtF communication and proxemics. The advancement of information and communications technology has provided tools for expressing oneself and conveying messages beyond just typing in text. As already discussed, arousal can divert one's attention or interest from a message to the source of the arousal. Virtual realities created online through computer- mediated communication, especially those which evoke strong visual presence through media, can increase arousal levels, such as those with high violent or sexual content. Just as people may use television viewing to increase or decrease arousal levels, people may use media in online communication to increase or decrease arousal levels. People may interact with others online by assuming the identities of avatars which may take on completely different, alternate personalities. The differences in perceived intimateness, co- presence, and emotionally-based trust can very significantly between avatar communication and other communication modalities such as text chat, audio, and audio-visual. The media options available to users when communicating with others online present a host of potential expectancy violations unique to CMC. The introduction of social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as dating social networks such as Match.com and eHarmony, has greatly contributed to the increased use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) which now offers a context for studying communication devoid of nonverbal information. Though these media are relatively new, they have been in existence long enough for users to have developed norms and expectations about appropriate behaviors in the online world. However, there has been a lag by researchers to study and understand these new established norms, which makes CMC rich with heuristic possibilities from a communications theory perspective. Ramirez and Wang studied the occurrence and timing of modality switching, or shifts from online communication to FtF interaction, from the perspective of EVT. Their research documented inconsistent findings which revealed in some instances relationships were enhanced and in others they were dampened, indicating the expectations, evaluations, and outcomes associated with initial modality switches varied amongst individuals. Additionally, studies have found that when individuals who meet online meet face-to-face for the first time, the length of time spent communicating online can determine whether individuals will rate physical characteristics of each other positively or negatively. Unlike FtF communication, CMC allows people to pretend to be connected with a person who violates their expectancy by ignoring violations or filtering news feed. Meanwhile, people can also cut the connection completely with someone who is not important by deleting friendship status when a serious violation occurs. A confrontation is much more likely for close friends than for acquaintances, and compensation is much more likely for acquaintances, a finding which contrasts typical EVT predictions. Furthermore, EVT on the Internet environment is strongly related to online privacy issues. Facebook Application in computer-mediated communication and social media-Facebook In social media such as Facebook, people are connected online with friends and sometimes strangers. Norm violations on Facebook may include too many status updates, overly emotional status updates or Wall posts, heated interactions, name calling through Facebook's public features, and tags on posts or pictures that might reflect negatively on an individual. Research has also shown that the act of unfriending on Facebook is perceived as a highly negative expectancy violation, with the duration of the Facebook friendship and personal ties to the unfriending party dictating how negatively the act is perceived. Moreover, the importance of the violation was also found to dictate whether the unfriending person informed the other individual of their actions. In a study conducted by Fife, Nelson, and Bayles of focus groups from a Southeastern liberal arts university, five themes were ascertained regarding Facebook use and expectancy violations: * \\"\\"Don't stalk' – and when you do, don't talk about it\\"  Though an understanding exists among Facebook participants that users will use the site to keep track of the behavior of others in a number of ways, excessive monitoring is likely to be perceived as an expectancy violation. * \\"Don't embarrass me with bad pictures\\"  Users may have the ability to control which pictures they post on their own Facebook page, but they do not have the ability to control what others post. Posting and \\"tagging\\" unflattering pictures of others may create expectancy violations. * \\"Don't mess up my profile\\"  Several participants expressed annoyance of others who alter their profiles knowing that their alterations could be perceived negatively, though they did not mention changing their passwords or protecting themselves in other ways. * \\"Choose an appropriate forum for messages\\"  Messages can be sent between Facebook participants through 'Facebook messages', which are not public, or 'wall postings', which can be viewed by anyone specified in the user's privacy controls. Posting messages which may be perceived as private, embarrassing, or inappropriate to a wall posting can create expectancy violations. * \\"Don't compete over number of friends\\"  Facebook users maintain a running total of 'friends' on their profile which is viewable to others. Engaging in comparisons with others over this statistic can create expectancy violations. In 2010, Stutzman and Kramer- Duffield examined college undergraduates' motivations to have friends-only profiles on Facebook. Having a friends-only profile is a practical method to enhance privacy management on Facebook. The two authors made distinctions between intended audience, to whom one hopes to disclose the Facebook profile, and expected audience, a group of people by whom one thinks the Facebook profile has been viewed. The study indicated that \\"expectancy violations were identified as instances where an expected audience was not jointly identified as an intended audience\\". Facebook networks were categorized into different levels: strong ties of family and intimate friends, weak ties comprising \\"casual friends and campus acquaintances\\", and outsiders such as \\"faculty or administrators\\". According to the study, expectancy violations by weak ties showed greater relevance to the establishment of a friends-only profile among college undergraduates, compared to other Facebook network ties.  Electronic mail  Email has become one of the most widely used methods of communication within organizations and workplaces. When discussing expectancy violations with electronic e-mail, just as with other modes of communication, a distinction must be made between inadvertent violations of norms and purposeful violations, referred to as 'flaming'. Flaming is defined as hostile and aggressive interactions via text-based CMC. One form of expectancy violation in email is the length of time between the sending of the initial email and the receiver's reply. Communicator reward valence plays a large part in how expectancy violations are handled in email communications. In computer- mediated communication, people have expectations to others’ online behaviors based on individual identity. In online contexts, violations are not simply assessed as positive or negative. Some violations are ambiguous such as e-mail response latency. In 2017, Nicholls and Rice stated that “when deviation is ambiguous, the communicator’s reward value will mediate the perceptions of the deviation.” Chronemic studies on email have shown that in organizations, responder status played a large part in how individuals reacted to various lapses in response to the previously sent email. Long pauses between responses for high-status responders produced positive expectancy violation valence and long pauses from low-status responders produced a negative expectancy violation valence. However, in the case of job interviews, long pauses between email for high-status candidates reflected negatively on their reviews. Expectations for email recipients to respond within a normative time limit illustrate the medium's capacity for expectancy violations to occur. = Academic environment =  Teacher anger  Application in academic environment McPherson, Kearney, and Plax examined teacher anger in college classrooms through the lens of norm violations. Naturally, teachers will become frustrated and angry with students in classrooms from time to time. How teachers express themselves and convey those emotions will determine how students respond and interpret those emotional demonstrations. The students judged the appropriateness of teachers' anger in classrooms in the modal expressions of distributive aggression, passive aggression, integrative assertion, and nonassertive denial. Students rated the aggressive expressions as highly intense, destructive, and inappropriate (or non-normative), including such behaviors as sarcasm or putdowns (most frequently cited), verbal abuse, rude and condescending behaviors toward students, and acts intended to demoralize students. The students described assertive displays as appropriate and less intense. Although anger is often considered to be a negative emotion, teacher anger is not necessarily a violation of classroom norms. Based on the study, intense and aggressive displays of teacher anger are considered socially inappropriate by students. These perceived norm violations result in negative evaluations of the teacher and the course. Because only integrative-assertive expressions of teacher anger were positively related to students' perceptions of appropriateness, the study concluded that teachers should avoid intense, aggressive anger displays and should rather assertively and directly discuss the problem with students.  Teacher dress  Clothing is considered a form of nonverbal communication. Dress communicates status, hierarchy, credibility, and attractiveness. Specific social codes dictate what forms of dress are appropriate in various cross-cultural contexts. When individuals wear clothing that is deemed inappropriate for a given situation, or when an individual's clothing does not seem to match their perceived status or attractiveness, this can constitute an expectancy violation. Studies on clothing and teacher perceptions have shown that when teachers wear formal attire, students rate their credibility higher. However, for high-reward teachers, clothing formality did not raise perceptions of attractiveness.  Instructor credibility in college classroom  Generally, students have expectations to their instructors in college classroom. According to Sidelinger and Bolen, students might be dissatisfied about instructors who talk a lot during class. After they did the research about the compulsive communication and communication satisfaction, they concluded that if an instructor is evaluated as credible by the students, his credibility decreases students’ dissatisfaction despite of his talkativeness. Particularly, instructor's goodwill such as politeness and care for students is the most effective characteristic to alleviate students’ negative feelings towards a talkative instructor.  Course ratings  Most American colleges and universities employ course rating surveys as a method to gauge teacher effectiveness and the degree to which students are satisfied with the pedagogy of their professors. Expectancy violation and violation valence play a part in course ratings because a wide range of expectancies exist for students while taking a course. Common expectancies for students include stimulation and interest, instructor behavior, relevance of the course, and the student's expected and actual success in the course. A higher education study on EVT and course ratings analyzed 228 students in seven introductory sociology classes at a university of 25,000 students. Since the courses were required for most students, were open to all students, used the same textbook, and met for the same length of time during the semester, expectancy violations in the classroom could be reported more accurately. Some factors used to report the data included instructor personality, interestingness and informativeness of textbook materials, difficulty of lectures, lecturer speaking ability, and the ability to answer questions. At the end of the study, the only factor that affected course ratings was relevance. Expectancies had virtually no effect otherwise on course evaluations. This reason could be attributed to the fact that students who found a course highly relevant were already interested in the subject area and were more motivated to do well.  Nontraditional college students  EVT has been used to study the experiences of non-traditional college and university students who begin an undergraduate education over the age of 25. The study focused on the students' expectations of their professors and how they should behave in the classroom. Since nontraditional students often feel that they are different from their academic peers, and since the traditional university setting focuses on the 18-23-year-old demographic, studying nontraditional student classroom experiences can help higher education institutions instruct teachers on how to behave in the classroom. Traditional and non-traditional students have been shown to expect teachers to make use of examples, provide feedback, and adequately prepare them for exams. Both traditional and non-traditional students have been found to have their expectations for instructor clarity negatively violated. Surprisingly, non- traditional students differed from traditional students by responding negatively to affinity-seeking behaviors and believed that instructors should be less concerned with making class more fun and enjoyable.  Student disclosures in college classroom  In 2013, Frisby and Sidelinger conducted a research about student disclosures in college classroom, which discussed about what kinds of student disclosures would violate peers’ expectations and their perceptions about the disclosers. According to the study, those who make inappropriate disclosures violate others’ expectations most in a classroom environment. Inappropriate disclosures are described as high frequent, negative, offensive and irrelevant topics. Disclosers of inappropriate information are more likely to be described as incompetent students, and they are less likeable than students who disclose appropriate information that are related to course materials. = Expectancy Violation Theory in Business Communication Crisis = EVT can also apply to everyday business interaction between long-term partners, new partners, and even the consumers. Each time a business interacts with another, both sides expect a positive gain in some capacity, however in reality this is not the case, losses are inevitable. In the article “The Role of Prior Expectancies and Relational Satisfaction in Crisis” (2014), Sora Kim asserts that \\"expectancy violations caused by a crisis tend to increase uncertainty about an organization’s performance in the crisis-related area\\". The author states that stakeholders, in the case of the BP Oil spill, held high levels of uncertainty towards the organization due to the high level of expectancy violations committed by BP. In the article \\"How does Corporate Reputation Affect Customer Loyalty in Corporate Crisis\\", Sabrina Helm and Julia Tolsdorf found that firms with greater reputation and customer loyalty are set to high expectations by the public, and tend to suffer more loss in profits in the event of a crisis, while firms with low reputations suffer minor losses. This shows that the public places its trust and loyalty in corporations due to their reputation, thus resulting in favorable outcomes for corporations. This reputation is also an Achilles heel for the corporation in times of crisis because when an expectation violation is committed by the corporations it produces negative outcomes for the corporation and the public's trust in them. Sora Kim also exposes similar findings in her study, specifically on how expectations violations produces uncertainties in stakeholders and the public during times of crisis. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is an expectation the public has set for major corporations and businesses, Nick Lin-Hi and Igor Blumberg also found that not practicing CSR negatively affect corporate reputation. Application in profanity use = Profanity use = Swearing is one example of observable instance of verbal expectancy violations. Examples of swearing expectancy violations include U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney telling Patrick Leahy, Senator of Vermont, to \\"go fuck yourself\\", actor Christian Bale's lashing out toward a bystander who walked in front of the camera while he was filming, and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's remarks during a live broadcast of his speech congratulating U.S. President Barack Obama on passage of the health care reform bill, commenting that it was a \\"big fucking deal\\". Expletives also vary among different cultures, so valence of expectancy violations involving swearing may differ when used in different contexts.  In workplaces  Swearing is common among many workplaces. Swearing has been identified functionally as one of several ways to express emotion in response to workplace stress, to convey verbal aggression, or to engage in deviant workplace behavior (Johnson, 2012). In formal work settings, people have much stronger feelings that their expectations are violated by swearing than in casual occasions. Expletives are more prevalent in unstructured conversations than in more structured, task-oriented ones (Johnson, 2012). The use of profanity has been shown to influence the perceptions of speakers. It may also have emotional impact on the user and the audience. Research has shown that profanity users appear less trustworthy, less sociable, and less educated. The more swearing messages one expresses that violate respondent's expectations in workplaces, the more negative evaluations the respondent will generate about the speaker's incompetency. These traits are likely to appear as fixed among profanity users. Moreover, the content of the swearing messages also poses great impact on the extent of expectancy violations in formal work settings. The verbal messages include words related to sex, excretion and profaneness. Research found that respondents experience highest level of surprise about the swearing with sexual expressions. Thus their expectations are more likely to be violated by sexual swearing than excretory and profane words. A more productive approach than focusing on whether a specific word is offensive may be to make sure that those engaging in workplace swearing are aware of how they and their messages might be perceived in multiple ways (Johnson, 2012). = Evaluation of media figures = Expectancy violations are tightly related to the changes of people's evaluation on their relationships with media figures. In 2010, Cohen made comparisons between relationships with friends and media figures in order to find similarities and differences of people's reactions when their expectations are violated in these two relationships. Violations were generally divided in three categories: social violations such as making offensive comments, trust violations such as making up stories about their life experience, and moral violations such as cheating in a marital relationship or drunk driving. Research indicated that in both friendships and relationships with media figures, social and trust violations are more offensive than moral violations. Specifically, people are more intolerable about moral violations from media figures than from their friends. According to the study, the reason for the intolerance is because relationships with media figures are relatively weak that people invest less on the relationships with media figures than on friendships. The type of media figures is also an important factor to determine the changes of closeness with media figures. People have different expectations to various types of media figures. Research discussed that moral violations negatively influence relationships with athletes, damaging their positive and energetic appearance expected by the public. Social violations reduce closeness with TV hosts, whom people expect as amiable public figures. = Health and self-improvement = Expectancy violation theory has even been applied to encouraging healthy habits and changing bad ones. In a study by Karolien van den Akker, Myrr van den Broek, Remco C. Havermans, and Anita Jansen, expectancy violation theory was tested to see if it was successful in changing ingrained cravings for chocolate. Although researchers did not find that expectancy violation mediated responses to chocolate cravings, they believe more research is needed to determine whether this theory is profitable for this kind of application to human behavior.  Metatheoretical assumptions  = Ontological assumptions = EVT assumes that humans have a certain degree of free will. This theory assumes that humans can assess and interpret the relationship and liking between themselves and their conversational partner, and then make a decision whether or not to violate the expectations of the other person. The theory holds that this decision depends on what outcome they would like to achieve. This assumption is based on the interaction position. The interaction position is based on a person's initial stance toward an interaction as determined by a blend of personal Requirements, Expectations, and Desires (RED). These RED factors meld into our interaction position of what's needed, anticipated, and preferred. = Epistemological assumptions = EVT assumes that there are norms for all communication activities and if these norms are violated, there will be specific, predictable outcomes. EVT does not fully account for the overwhelming prevalence of reciprocity that has been found in interpersonal interactions. Secondly, it is silent on whether communicator valence supersedes behavior valence or vice versa when the two are incongruent, such as when a disliked partner engages in a positive violation. = Axiological assumptions = This theory seeks to be value-neutral as supporting studies have been conducted empirically and sought to objectively describe how humans react when their expectations are violated.  Critique  = Predictability and testability = EVT has undergone scrutiny for its attempt to provide a covering law for certain aspects of interpersonal communication. Some critics of EVT believe most interactions between individuals are extremely complex and there are many contingencies to consider within the theory. This makes the prediction of behavioral outcomes of a particular situation virtually impossible to consistently predict. Another critique of the theory is the assumption that expectancy violations are mostly highly consequential acts, negative in nature, and cause uncertainty to increase between communicators. In actuality, research shows expectancy violations vary in frequency, seriousness, and valence. While it is true that many expectancy violations carry a negative valence, numerous are positive and actually reduce uncertainty because they provide additional information within the parameters of the particular relationship, context, and communicators.  A First Look at Communication  Emory Griffin, the author of A First Look at Communication Theory, analyzed unpredictability in EVT. His test consisted in analyzing his interaction with four students who made various requests from him. The students were given the pseudonyms Andre, Belinda, Charlie and Dawn. They start with the letters A, B, C and D to represent the increasing distance between them and Griffin when making their requests. thumb Adapted from Griffin's diagram in the book A first look at communication theory. Andre needed the author's endorsement for a graduate scholarship, and spoke to him from an intimate eyeball-to-eyeball distance. According to Burgoon's early model, Andre made a mistake when he crossed Griffin's threat threshold; the physical and psychological discomfort the lecturer might feel could have hurt his cause. However, later that day Griffin wrote the letter of recommendation. Belinda needed help with a term paper for a class with another professor, and asked for it from a 2-foot distance. Just as Burgoon predicted, the narrow gap between Belinda and Griffin determined him to focus his attention on their rocky relationship, and her request was declined. Charlie invited his lecturer to play water polo with other students, and he made the invitation from the right distance of 7 feet, just outside the range of interaction Griffin anticipated. However, his invitation was declined. Dawn launched an invitation to Griffin to eat lunch together the next day, and she did this from across the room. According to the nonverbal expectancy violations model, launching an invitation from across the room would guarantee a poor response, but this time, the invitation was successful. Griffin's attempt to apply Burgoon's original model to conversational distance between him and his students didn't meet with much success. The theoretical scoreboard read: : Nonverbal expectancy violations model: 1 : Unpredicted random behavior: 3 However, when Grifffin applied the revised EVT standards on his responses to \\"the proxemic violations of Andre, Belinda, Charlie, and Dawn,\\" the scorecard \\"shows four hits and no misses.\\"A First Look at Communication Theory, 9th edition, p. 92  Related theories  Because EVT is sociopsychological in nature and focuses on social codes in both intrapersonal and interpersonal communication, it is closely related to communication theories such as cognitive dissonance and uncertainty reduction theory. Recently, this theory has undergone some reconstitution by Burgoon and her colleagues and has resulted in a newly proposed theory known as interaction adaptation theory, which is a more comprehensive explanation of adaptation in interpersonal interaction. As mentioned above, EVT has strong roots in uncertainty reduction theory. The relationship between violation behavior and the level of uncertainty is under study. Research indicates that violations differ in their impact on uncertainty. To be more specific, incongruent negative violations heightened uncertainty, whereas congruent violations (both positive and negative) caused declines in uncertainty. The theory also borrows from social exchange theory in that people seek reward out of interaction with others. Two other theories share similar outlooks to EVT – Discrepancy-Arousal Theory (DAT) and Patterson's social facilitation model (SFM). Like EVT, DAT explains that a receiver becomes aroused when a communicative behavior does not match the receiver's expectations. In DAT, these differences are called discrepancies instead of expectancy violations. Cognitive dissonance and EVT both try to explain why and how people react to unexpected information and adjust themselves during communication process. The social facilitation model has a similar outlook and labels these differences as unstable changes. A key difference between the theories lies in the receiver's arousal level. Both DAT and SFM maintain that the receiver experiences a physiological response whereas EVT focuses on the attention shift of the receiver. EVT posits that expectancy violations occur frequently and are not always as serious as perceived through the lenses of other theories. Anxiety/uncertainty management theory is the uncertainty and anxiety people have towards each other, relating to EVT this anxiety and uncertainty can differ between cultures. Causing a violation for example violating someones personal distance or communicating ineffectively can cause uncertainty and anxiety. The popularity of computer- mediated communication (CMC) as means of conducting task-oriented and socially oriented interactions is a part of the social information processing (SIP) theory. Coined by Joseph Walther, the theory explores CMC's ability to fulfill many of the same functions as the more traditional forms of interaction, especially face-to-face (FtF) interaction. SIP can be used in conjunction with EVT to examine interpersonal and hyperpersonal relationships established through CMC.  Further use and development of the theory  The concept of social norms marketing follows expectancy violation in that it is based upon the notion that messages containing facts that vary from perception of the norm will create a positive expectancy violation. Advertising, strategic communications, and public relations base social norms campaigns on this position. Interaction adaptation theory further explores expectancy violations. Developed by Burgoon to take a more comprehensive look at social interaction, IAT posits that people enter into interactions with requirements, expectations, and desires. These factors influence both the initial behavior as well as the response behavior. When faced with behavior that meets an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, the response behavior will be positive. When faced with behavior that does not meet an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, he or she can respond either positively or negatively depending on the degree of violation and positive or negative valence of the relationship.Floyd, K. & Ray, G. (2005). Adaptation to Expressed Liking and Disliking in Initial Interactions: Nonverbal Involvement and Pleasantness Response Patterns. Conference Papers -- International Communication Association Annual Meeting, 1-39. Expectancies exert significant influence on people's interaction patterns, on their impressions of one another, and on the outcomes of their interactions. People who can assume that they are well regarded by their audience are safer engaging in violations and more likely to profit from doing so than are those who are poorly regarded. When the violation act is one that is likely to be ambiguous in its meaning or to carry multiple interpretations that are not uniformly positive or negative, then the reward valence of the communicator can be especially significant in moderating interpretations, evaluations, and subsequent outcomes. EVT also applies to international experience in the workplace. “A foreign newcomer who has the necessary education, work experience, and international experience will be perceived as having the ability to make valuable contribution to the group's task. Consequently, education, work experience and international experience will influence a foreign newcomer's initial task-based group acceptance (Joardar, 2011). It can be argued that a person with significant international experience will be perceived as having had the opportunity to learn how to build valuable relationships in a cross-cultural setting. Hence, international experience will have effects on initial relationship-based group acceptance as well. Meaning, this will make for a more positive expectancy violation, in the workplace especially. EVT is also used as a framework to analyze the negative impact of mind reading expectations on romantic relationships. In 2015, Wright and Roloff explain the idea of mind reading expectations (MRE) that romantic partners should clearly know about each other's feelings even though they are not being informed. When relational partners have done something wrong without self-consciousness, people's expectations are violated. Particularly those who hold high value of MRE are more likely to become distressful once their relational partners are unaware of their violations to expectations. The study asserts that such kinds of violations related to MRE result in responses such as combative attitude and silent treatment, which is harmful to long-term romantic relationships.

It began as an in-house publication, but grew to 5,000 subscribers in 1963. In the early 1990s the magazine collapsed into a four- page newsletter. In 1994, Jack Tucker was appointed as the Editor the publication into today's magazine. Walter Fernandez Jr. leads the magazine's team, with publications committee chair Edgar Burcksen. ACE Student Editing Competition The American Cinema Editors also holds an annual student competition, awarding one student editor for editing a set of video dailies for a dramatic scene. Three finalists are guests at the annual ACE Eddie Awards in February. Applications are accepted through October and cost US$125. The competition is limited to the first 100 students only. Gunsmoke editing exercise The ACE Store is the source of the dailies used at most film schools today, primarily for editing exercises. One scene that many film students must edit is from \\"Buffalo Man,\\" a 1958 episode of the TV series Gunsmoke. The educational film with this footage is called Film Editing: Interpretation and Value, and is available only to instructors of film editing classes. The film includes three different edits of the Gunsmoke scene, as well as the scene's original dailies.
