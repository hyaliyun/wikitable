Smith is Director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic and Co-Director of the E. Barrett Prettyman Fellowship Program. Before joining the faculty at Georgetown Law, Smith worked as a public defender in Philadelphia for many years and she was also on the faculty at Harvard Law School. Professor Smith regularly writes and comments on criminal defense, the criminal justice system, criminal prosecution, legal ethics, and juvenile justice. Smith wrote a memoir about her experience of helping Patsy Kelly Jarrett earn her freedom from a conviction for which Jarrett maintained her innocence. Education Smith earned a B.A.degree from Yale College in 1978 and a J.D. degree from the New York University School of Law in 1982. During her second year of law school at NYU—while working in the Prison Law Clinic with Professor Claudia Angelos—Smith began working on Patsy Kelly Jarrett's federal habeas corpus petition. In March 1977, a jury found Jarrett guilty of two counts of murder and two counts of robbery, but Jarrett maintained her innocence. Smith worked on Jarrett's case for the next 25 years. From 2005–2006, Smith was a Fulbright Program scholar at the University of Melbourne School of Law in Melbourne, Australia. Legal career =Public defender= After law school, Ms. Smith began work as an assistant public defender with the Defender Association of Philadelphia. She would later work as a member of the Special Defense Unit, and a Senior Trial Attorney. While working as a public defender in Philadelphia, Smith began working as a law professor, teaching criminal law at City University of New York Law School. =Law professor= In 1990, Smith moved to Harvard Law School where she was Deputy Director of the Criminal Justice Institute, a clinical instructor in HLS' criminal defense clinic, and a lecturer on law in Harvard's Trial Advocacy Workshop. The Criminal Justice Institute is the curriculum-based criminal law clinical program of Harvard Law School.http://www.law.harvard.edu/academics/clinical/cji/ Smith joined the Georgetown University Law Center faculty in 1996. Professor Smith is the Director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy (CDPAC) Clinic. From 1994–2005, Smith was the attorney for Patsy Kelly Jarrett. Over the years, Smith contacted journalists, public relations firms and wrote about Kelly in law journals. In 2003, Smith convinced documentarian Ofra Bikel—who was working on a film about guilty pleas for the PBS television show Frontline—to include Jarrett in the documentary. The documentary aired in 2004. During a March 2005 review of the case, the members of the New York Parole Board watched Bikel's account of Jarrett's story, and she was released. Case of a Lifetime was a finalist in the 21st Lambda Literary Awards for best lesbian memoir/biography. In 2010, she was elected to the American Board of Criminal Lawyers. She is also on the board at the Bronx defenders., and the National Juvenile Defender Center. In 2012, she was the recipient of the Legal Teaching Award from New York University School of Law. In 2015, Smith eulogized her friend and colleague Monroe Freedman. Writings & commentary Professor Smith writes and comments on criminal defense, the criminal justice system, criminal prosecution, legal ethics, and juvenile justice.\\"I Ain't Taking' No Plea\\": The Challenges in Counseling Young People Facing Serious Time, 60 Rutgers L. Rev. 11–31 (2007).Defending and Despairing: The Agony of Juvenile Defense, 6 Nev. L.J. 1127–1136 (2006) Her scholarship has been cited in numerous opinions. In State v. Citizen, The Supreme Court of Louisiana cited her scholarship on indigent defendants' right to appointed counsel under Gideon v. Wainwright.http://www.lasc.org/opinions/2005/04ka1841.opn.pdf =Criminal defense= Professor Smith writes about representing unpopular clients. She wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post titled, \\"What motivates a lawyer to defend a Tsarnaev, a Castro or a Zimmerman?\\" Smith co- edited How Can You Represent Those People? with Monroe Freedman. In the book—a collection of essays—criminal defense lawyers and others share stories about how it feels to defend people accused of crimes ranging from the ordinary to the horrific. In a piece on Judy Clarke and representing unpopular clients, she remarked: \\"Criminal defense is kind of a unique calling — not to sound pretentious — it takes a peculiar heart-set, mind-set to do the work for a career.\\" She continued, \\"We stand behind people who are often the most reviled.\\" She discussed why lawyers defend monsters on MSNBC. In Too Much Heart and Not Enough Heat: The Short Life and Fractured Ego of the Empathic, Heroic Public Defender, Smith writes about how one can sustain a career in indigent criminal defense. In order to do this, Smith recommends respect for clients, passion for the professional craft of defense lawyering, and a sense of outrage about the system. Smith writes about two former Prettyman fellows who left indigent criminal defense. Smith rejects Charles Ogletree's paradigm of public defenders as empathetic heroes. In The Bounds of Zeal in Criminal Defense: Some Thoughts on Lynne Stewart, Smith discusses the conduct that led to Lynne Stewart's prosecution and her approach to lawyering generally. Smith examines whether Stewart's view of zeal and devotion is at odds with the prevailing ethics and ethos of defense lawyering. Smith finds it troubling when the government criminally prosecutes members of the defense bar, especially when it goes after lawyers who represent unpopular clients. =Prosecutors= Smith often writes about prosecutors. In Are Prosecutors Born or Made?, Smith writes about her encounters with prosecutors and countless conversations during the course of her thirty-year criminal law practice. In Can You Be a Good Person and a Good Prosecutor?, Smith examines the morality of prosecution. First, she explores the context of criminal lawyering at the millennium and what it means to prosecute under current conditions. Then, she discusses whether it is possible to do \\"good\\" in this context—that is, whether a well-intentioned prosecutor can temper the harsh reality of the criminal justice system—in view of the institutional and cultural pressures of prosecutor offices. Smith concludes by answering the question posed: she hopes so, but thinks not. In A Call to Abolish Peremptory Challenges by Prosecutors, Smith argues that courts should acknowledge the unenforceability of Batson v. Kentucky, the landmark United States Supreme Court case prohibiting prosecutors from excluding jurors in criminal cases based solely on race, and admit that the only way to end this insidious practice that leads to less diverse juries is to abolish peremptory challenges by prosecutors.

Often simply referred to as “The Harrisons”, Helen and Newton have produced multimedia work across a vast range of disciplines. They work in collaboration with biologists, ecologists, historians, activists, architects, urban planners and fellow artists to initiate dialogues and create works exploring biodiversity and community development. Helen and Newton Harrison are both Professors Emeriti at University of California, Santa Cruz, and University of California, San Diego. They have had numerous international solo exhibitions and their work is in the collections of many public institutions including the Pompidou Center, the Museum of Modern Art, the San Jose Museum of Art, the Nevada Museum of Art, and the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2013 the Harrisons became the first recipients of the Corlis Benefideo Award for Imaginative Cartography. Stanford University Libraries acquired The Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, an extensive archive that documents their life and work with a significant amount of audiovisual material and born-digital files.  Early life and education  Helen Mayer was a gifted student born on July 1, 1927, in New York City in the city's easternmost borough of Queens where her parents worked as schoolteachers. Graduating from Forest Hills High School in 1943 at sixteen years old, she earned a full tuition scholarship to attend Cornell University. She enrolled at Cornell and majored in psychology for two years, but ultimately returned home to earn her bachelor's degree in English from Queens College in 1948. She also earned a master's degree in the philosophy of education from New York University (NYU) in 1952. Newton Abner Harrison was born on October 20, 1932 in New York City in the borough of Brooklyn and then raised in the nearby suburb of New Rochelle. Newton's grandfather Simon W. Farber was a tinsmith who emigrated from Russia to seek prosperity in America in the late 19th century. He opened a small brassware shop on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Kitchen utensils and ornamental objects sold well. Customers appreciated the immediacy and quality of his product as compared to the expensive brassware imported from Europe. When Simon transitioned from hand hammering to metal spinning with an automated machine lathe, both production and sales dramatically increased. In 1907 he opened a manufacturing plant in Brooklyn to further expand his line of kitchen utensils, which he branded Farberware. The Meyer Corporation acquired Farberware in 1997 and promotes the company as one of the oldest and most trusted brands in American housewares. At age fifteen Newton told his parents Estelle Farber and Harvey Harrison that he wanted to become an artist. They asked that he continue his studies at Peddie Prep High School, a college preparatory school in New Jersey, but arranged a fine arts apprenticeship with New Rochelle's celebrated sculptor Michael Lantz. Newton assisted Lantz in the off intervals of his high school and college years from 1948 through 1953. The apprenticeship included lessons in modeling, plaster casting, woodwork, and the creation of architectural scale models as well as drafting and reading architectural blueprints. Newton attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio for several years before transferring to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) in Philadelphia to formalize his study of sculpture. PAFA faculty and local art collectors encouraged Newton to develop his Rodin-like approach to the human figure: his ability to convey the poetic motions of the body and soul using clay.Mrs. Catherine Biddle Cadwalader Scull, whom along with her husband Mr. Richard Barclay Scull commissioned Newton to create a rooftop sculpture for their home in the Radnor Township of Villanova, likened Newton's Love Groups (1957) to the work of Auguste Rodin, citing The Kiss (1889) as a comparable example of two nudes embracing. See Mrs. Scull quoted in \\"Nude Statues on Roof Cause Traffic Jam on Main Line\\" and Thomas Hovenden, \\"Plastic Nudes in Quaker Land: Ups and Downs of Works Raise Stock of Plymouth Mtg. Sculptor,\\" The Times Herald (undated) in Scrapbook 1 (1957-1958). Series 7, Early Work by Newton Harrison, Flat Box 290. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections & University Archives, Stanford University. Helen and Newton married in 1953. There is a notable collection of letters in the Harrison Papers at Stanford written and received by the Harrisons on their first trip abroad to Florence, Italy where they lived from 1957 to 1960 with partial funding from PAFA's Scheidt Memorial Scholarship and the rest financed by Newton's parents Estelle and Harvey. The Florence letters express the couple's experience living abroad and contemplating the purpose of their lives. Helen was the director of the International Nursery School in Florence for two of the three years they lived abroad, although the focus of the letters is Newton's resolve to become a professional artist. \\"Many thanks,\\" begins one letter to Estelle and Harvey, for you both \\"enable us to find ourselves. The way of the artist is not an easy one, but the rewards for us are many, and the promise of being able to use ourselves significantly according to our capacities is the only promise that holds meaning for us.\\"\\"Dearest Mother and Dad, Much Love, Us\\" (undated). Series 4. Correspondence, Box 121, Folders 2-4. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections & University Archives, Stanford University. The Harrisons returned from Florence to the bustling New York City art scene in 1960. Newton initially found work teaching experimental painting to children at housing settlement projects and neighborhood centers. He then enrolled at the Yale University School of Art and Architecture to complete his bachelor's degree in fine arts. The Korean War draft had interrupted progress towards his bachelor's degree at PAFA. He enrolled in 1952, but was then obliged to serve two years in the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1955. The Harrisons' time living abroad in Florence had further postponed completion of the bachelor's degree. In the early 1960s New York City was ground zero for the Greenbergian ethos of abstract painting, emphasizing the autonomy and primacy of paint applied to a transcendent picture plane. The conventions of figure modeling and perspective had become extremely passé. With these influences, Newton set sculpture aside and began establishing himself as a painter. Sewell Sillman and Al Held were two key mentors for Newton during his time at Yale. Combining lessons in color theory with Sillman and lessons in hard-edged abstraction with Held, he painted bold compositions. Yet those paintings retained their objectness. They appeared as if pigmented sculptures set in relation to the surrounding architecture. Newton graduated from Yale in 1965 at age thirty-two with both a bachelor's and master's degree in fine art. He then secured his first faculty position as Assistant Professor in Charge of Visual Fundamentals at the University of New Mexico (UNM). With four school- aged children and her own set of degrees, Helen also went back to work at UNM teaching literature, although she oriented her work in the field of education more broadly. Helen wanted to raise the issue of equality and access to good education at every level of society. She and Newton collaborated on writing an essay exploring new directions in arts education for high school dropouts. Entitled \\"Dropouts and a 'Design for Living',\\" the essay was published in New Perspectives on Poverty.Shostak, Arthur B. and William Gomberg, eds. (1965). New Perspectives on Poverty. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc. The Harrisons moved to La Jolla, California in 1967 when abstract expressionist painter Paul Brach, the founding chair of the Visual Arts Department at UC San Diego, recruited Newton to join his faculty.The \\"Early Life and education\\" segment of this page is adapted from Eliasieh, Laura (née Rogers). \\"The Social and Environmental Turn in Late 20th Century Art: A Case Study of Helen and Newton Harrison After Modernism.\\" PhD diss., Stanford University, 2017. https://purl.stanford.edu/gy939rt6115  Sculpture in the expanded field  Newton had a peripheral relationship to the structuralist theory of Rosalind Krauss presented in her seminal essay \\"Sculpture in the Expanded Field.\\" In this essay Krauss describes a trend in American art after modernism and the Greenbergian ethos of abstract painting. She observed between 1968 and 1970 that American artists began to challenge the ontology of art objects and to see artistic agency as extending beyond the confines of the museum and art gallery. Working in the expanded field could no longer be described as modernist. This essay published in 1979 made an important contribution to the discourse on transformations of the late 20th century avant-garde. After arriving at UC San Diego in 1967, Newton began a three-year period of intensive experimentation in the expanded field. During this time he engaged directly and freely with engineers, biologists, politicians, and even corporations outside the domain of art. He participated in Billy Kluver's Experiments in Art and Technology as well as Maurice Tuchman's Art and Technology program at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). He produced schematic designs for artworks exploring the organic and interactive behavior of living and technological systems, and began thinking about growth processes and transformations as the work of art more so than images and objects.The \\"Sculpture in the expanded field\\" segment of this page is adapted from Eliasieh, Laura (née Rogers). \\"The Social and Environmental Turn in Late 20th Century Art: A Case Study of Helen and Newton Harrison After Modernism.\\" PhD diss., Stanford University, 2017. https://purl.stanford.edu/gy939rt6115  Switching careers midstream  Helen and Newton proceeded along different paths and at different speeds to transform their careers after arriving at UC San Diego in 1967. The unsettled period of reflecting on ideas about science, technology, equality, and justice in the late 1960s is key to understanding their decision to begin collaborating with one another in 1970 on the occasion of the \\"Furs and Feathers\\" exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City. In a work called An Ecological Nerve Center presented at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, they inaugurated a career of experimenting in the production as well as display of art as knowledge informing social and environmental change. Moving to California in 1967, Helen enrolled at United States International University (known today as Alliant International University) to begin an interdisciplinary doctoral program in the Graduate School of Leadership and Human Behavior. With continuing concern for equality and social justice, she was looking to refresh and synthesize three areas of expertise—language, learning, and social psychology—so that she could contribute research towards ensuring that all students have equal prospects for living well. However, Helen withdrew from the doctoral program after joined UC Extension Division as an education program coordinator in 1969 and promoting to a director position in 1970. During her tenure as director of UC Extension Division's education programs, enrollment and course offerings rose from an average of forty-two classes to fifty-five classes per quarter. Helen's goal was to provide teachers of San Diego County with courses to enhance their level of expertise in subject areas, while also providing them with a deeper understanding of psychology and childhood development. She expanded the reach of UC Extension Division's education programs to more than ten school districts in the county and introduced one-day and two-week conferences that drew participants from across the country. While studying at United States International University, Helen also collected writings by the vanguard of the Women's Liberation Movement including: Alice S. Rossi's \\"Status of Women in Graduate Departments of Sociology: 1968-1969,\\" accepted for publication in The American Sociologist (Fall 1969) and made available through the Women's Caucus of the American Sociological Association at their San Francisco convention; Beverly Jones and Judith Brown's \\"Toward a Female Liberation Movement,\\" published by New England Free Press; and Naomi Weisstein's \\"Kinde, Kuche, Kirche as Scientific Law: Psychology Constructs the Female,\\" published by New England Free Press.\\"On Women\\" paper notes (1968-1969). Series 1, Personal/Biographical, Subseries 5, Harrison Family, Box 218, Folder 9. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections & University Archives, Stanford University. In the wake of second wave feminism, Helen's concern for equality and social justice had grown to include, in a more direct way, her own rights as a woman to use herself significantly according to her own capacities and to be recognized for her contributions. It is this alchemy of ambition and social consciousness that led Helen to begin collaborating with Newton in the conceptualization and making of An Ecological Nerve Center (1970-1971) at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City. Helen actually took the lead in producing An Ecological Nerve Center for the \\"Furs and Feathers\\" exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts. She assembled students from the Visual Arts Department at UC San Diego into a small research team to expand on information that she had requested from the World Wildlife Fund regarding the destruction of natural habitats and resident species that suffer from that destruction; their fleshy bodies subject to the insatiable demands of the world market economy. Her influence is especially apparent in the team's approach to presenting the information in the context of a museum. Artists experimenting with art and technology in the late 1960s, including Newton, had been working with information. They had been using new computer technologies to program sculptures as self-regulating cybernetic systems built on the concept of feedback to explore the relationship of machines (perhaps as proxies for humans) to their surroundings.Plasma Chambers (1969–1971), designed in collaboration with engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as part of the Art and Technology Program at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), is the most distinguished of Newton’s art and technology projects. Newton began working with a student in the Physics Department at UC San Diego to experiment with glow discharge demonstrations, which show how an electric force introduced to a medium of noble gas plasma will produce colored light—orange in the case of neon gas—in a process called ionization. A neon light is a miniature glow discharge environment. JPL engineers helped Newton design an even larger glow discharge chamber to increase the visibility of ionization, which can form diffuse shapes and patterns. Plasma Chambers traveled to the 1970 World Exposition in Osaka along with seven other esteemed works from LACMA’s Art and Technology Program before the opening of the official “Art and Technology” exhibition in Los Angeles on May 16, 1971. Helen's approach was different. She worked with students to produce a Rolodex (appreciating the simplicity of the rotating desktop card index invented in 1956 by the Danish engineer Hildaur Neilsen) as a sculptural object containing didactic yet poetic descriptions of species extinct, endangered, formerly endangered, and in over supply, and constructed in a way that would permit change as new data became available. She and the students then created a 4'x14' chart visualization of the data contained in the Rolodex to be hung on the wall of the museum gallery, as if a painting, alongside a 14'x14' world map produced by Newton interpreting the Rolodex data as a spatial narrative. It is important to recognize the work that Helen and the students produced for An Ecological Nerve Center as politically entangled, unspectacular, and strong because of it. The Rolodex invited people to participate in the tactile process of retrieving and making sense of information, rather than stand in awe before an eye-catching digital media display. The chart asserted that people are already equipped to process the gravity of species extinction and take decisive action. \\"The numbers always change\\" explained Newton in the exhibition catalog \\"and research shows that an endangered form can regenerate itself when protection is enforced, and again assume its role in the life cycle.\\"Harrison, Newton (1971). \\"An Ecological Proposal\\" in Furs and Feathers, ed. Paul J. Smith. New York: Museum of Contemporary Crafts of the American Crafts Council. In his review of the \\"Furs and Feathers\\" exhibition, Richard Elman described gazing at \\"a large white map of the world in the main entranceway that was annotated densely with print, especially the U.S. portion, in tones of red and gray to distinguish 'endangered' from 'exterminated' species of wildlife.\\" Even more impressionable was an accompanying audio recording that Elman recalls as \\"a litany, a casualty list, intoned in a flat dispirited voice. On and on it went for quite some fifteen minutes about the hunting pursuits of the sheiks of the Arabian peninsula, entire populations of sea birds, monkeys, lions, vincuñas, and the great auk.\\"Elman, Richard. \\"Furs and Feathers.\\" Craft Horizons 31, 2 (April 1971): 43. So why, after many months of working with students to prepare An Ecological Nerve Center for exhibition, is Helen's name conspicuously absent from the exhibition catalog, Elman's review, and other promotional materials? Neither the \\"Furs and Feathers\\" curator nor critic acknowledged her contributions. It would take yet more time and dedication, in the wake of second wave feminism, for Helen to come forth as an artist equal to Newton. She resigned from her director position with UC Extension Division's education programs in 1972 to pursue art full-time. In her resignation letter, she wrote with affection, \\"I have had too much fun here! However, I am becoming an artist in my old age and I am doing what we have offered a number of Extension courses about - 'switching careers midstream'.\\"Resignation letter from Helen to Dr. Martin N. Chamberlain, University Extension (August 25, 1972). Series 10, University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Box 178, Folder 1. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections & University Archives, Stanford University. Pivotal to the story of Helen solidifying her career as an artist are two solo works through which she arrived at her own avant-garde understanding of participation in growth form and growth activism. Strawberry Jam (1973), the first solo work, began when Dextra Frankel, Director of the Art Gallery of California State University at Fullerton, contacted Helen in February 1973 to inquire if she would like to participate as a solo artist in a large group exhibition entitled \\"In a Bottle.\\" As Helen recalls in a typewritten statement reflecting back on the exhibition: “I had just finished assisting Newton Harrison with a work called Strawberry Wall and he suggested that I do a performance of making jam, since I did the feasts for his growth works, and I thought—what goes in a bottle but Jam.” On a separate piece of paper, torn from an old notepad of the English Language and Literature Department at the University of New Mexico (where Helen taught from 1965 to 1967), she recorded a stream of consciousness that further elaborates on her creative process: “One of the things to do with a bottle is fill it. One of the basic things to fill a bottle with is food. One makes the food and preserves it in the bottle. Collecting bottles and filling them with food…imagine there is no food for us this year and we have to make next year’s food—Food Wall—give up its yield to other people in a series of feasts—abundance ritual—record it.”Materials from Strawberry Jam at the Woman's Building, Los Angeles, CA (March 23, 1974). Series 5, Performances and Exhibitions, Box 136, Folder 8-9. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections & University Archives, Stanford University. Strawberry Jam thus became an endurance performance in which Helen made fifteen jars of strawberry jam per day for six consecutive days using only natural ingredients like lemon juice and wine to thicken the mixture, and as little sugar as possible to acquaint herself with the sweet flavor of the fruit itself. The recipes varied each day based on the sweetness of the berries plucked from the plants, and the jam became increasingly tart as Helen came to appreciate the way lemon and wine enhanced the acidic undertone of the berries. The initial five days of the performance took place in private. On the sixth day, Helen staged the making of Strawberry Jam for an audience at the Art Gallery of California State College at Fullerton. And on the seventh day, she rested. Six months later Helen resumed making strawberry jam as an artistic research project. She had continued ruminating on the conceptual imagery of the bottle and its attendant ideology of preservation. She wondered how the medium of photography would serve as a tool of preservation or perhaps continuity, not of the fruit itself, but of the knowledge and skill required to plant, grow, and harvest strawberries in cycles of regeneration with moments of abundance and scarcity. As a studio experiment, Helen used square wall-mounted shelves to arrange a canvas-like grid composition of jars filled with jam left over from the Fullerton exhibition. She then entreated Philip Steinmetz, a conceptual artist and photographer who in 1971 had joined the Visual Arts Department faculty at UC San Diego, to make two color images: one of abundance with all the jars in place so as to fill the shelves, and one of scarcity with only a few jars in place. She also produced a third and compelling image in which she placed just three jars on top of a short stack of books, including Jack Burnham’s The Structure of Art, and printed several copies such that she could modify the composition using collage techniques. With collage, Helen could adjust the quantity of jars and stack them in different cumulative formations as a way of reflecting on the merits of growth form and growth activism by women in relation to the so-called structure of art. Off Strawberry Wall (1974), Helen's second solo work, began when feminist art historian Arlene Raven invited Helen to participate in the exhibition program at the Women's Building of Los Angeles. Helen paired up with Joyce Shaw for a three-week exhibition at Grandview One Gallery inside the Women's Building. The artist statement that she produced for this show further demonstrates the fluidness of her thinking about time, labor, culture, art, preservation, and continuity of life. In this statement, she explained that both strawberry works are “spin-offs and amusements from feasts and performances that I have done in other contexts. I am interested in the relationship between the morphologies and transformations that happen in living and growing and cooking and the transformations that we call art. I am especially interested in those intentional transformations that make objects stand for process. The play of time, nature and artifice is an important element in my work and I am intrigued by the juxtaposition of real growth strawberries, shelf-life for the jam and the instantaneous transformations of the camera and collage.” On the largest wall of Grandview One Gallery, Helen hung the Steinmetz photographs alongside her exploratory collage that questioned the merits of work by women in relation to the structure of art. On an adjacent wall, she installed a low- lying horizontal pasture of strawberry plants in modular container-like forms that Newton had designed for Survival Pieces. But the closing of the exhibition on March 23, 1974 would coincide with a special celebration explicitly called \\"A Woman Made Day\\" to include an array of events such as a gynecological self-help slideshow by the Feminist Women's Health Center, a karate and self-defense demonstration by Karen Iwafuchi, an open forum on survival and power by the Commission Against Rape, a presentation about the creation of the Feminist Studio Workshop (the entity that founded the Women's Building), and a jamming performance by Helen. With Strawberry Jam (1973) and Off Strawberry Wall (1974), Helen reaffirmed the work of art as an opening for participants to learn, sense, and even bond with their food sources as precious—and in turn to see themselves as capable of making growth and form choices that benefit society without degrading the earth. These two strawberry works also signaled a turning point in a new politics of knowledge—an affirmative politics—by which Helen and Newton Harrison began combining scientific research on environmental issues like pollution and global warming with self-critical introspection, mixed media technologies, and the live action of performance art to energize the epistemologies and ontologies of academia and civic life.The \\"Switching Careers Midstream\\" segment of this page is adapted from Eliasieh, Laura (née Rogers). \\"The Social and Environmental Turn in Late 20th Century Art: A Case Study of Helen and Newton Harrison After Modernism.\\" PhD diss., Stanford University, 2017. https://purl.stanford.edu/gy939rt6115 A decade or two later, the Harrisons both became tenured faculty in the Visual Arts Department at UC San Diego.  Collaborative studio practice  Helen and Newton recruited their youngest son Gabriel Harrison and Vera Westergaard to join them in establishing the Harrison Studio in 1993. The Studio relocated from La Jolla to Santa Cruz in 2004. The Harrison Studio's subject matter ranges across a large number of disciplines, yet always has at its core the eco-social well-being of place and community. Whether dealing with the reclamation of watersheds, reforestation, or modest projects in cities and their surrounds, whole systems thinking guides the conceptual processes of their research. They have exhibited broadly and internationally with large-scale installations using diverse media that have critical and propositional thinking in them. They use the exhibition format in several ways, often in the sense of a town meeting, always with the intention of seeing their proposals moving off the walls, landing in planning processes, and ultimately resulting in interventions towards social and environmental justice. The Harrison Studio locates their work within the domains of both art and science. By operating in the domain of art, the Harrisons teach the ecological dimensions of the human condition better than they could were they working in the domain of science. By doing art with ecological content, the Studio implies that the human species should treat the planet as a sculpture. The first major collaborative work Helen and Newton produced in the early 1970s is known collectively as Survival Pieces, so named because they intended each installation in the series to contribute to the design of a productive and sustainable food system (e.g. hog pasture, a catfish farm, and a citrus and avocado orchard). The Survival Pieces were exhibited in reputable galleries, commissioned by major museums, praised by influential critics, and studied by historians as well as philosophers. The work heralded future histories of BioArt and debates over the ethics, ontologies, and affects of non-human or posthuman life. The Harrisons worked with living entities as art mediums, and adopted biofunctions like waste, procreating, growing, evolving, dying, and decaying as art processes. Helen and Newton began working with global warming in the late 1970s as a result of a career-defining work called “The Lagoon Cycle”. All the work the Harrison Studio does involving this issue assumes that the world's oceans are indeed rising and reshaping the planet; they too are sculptors. This poetic idea is especially prominent in the Harrison Studio’s ongoing series “The Force Majeure” (2007–Present). The Center for the Study of the Force Majeure, founded by Helen and Newton Harrison at UC Santa Cruz, operates on the principle that \\"We as a species must adapt ourselves to a very different world...proceed[ing] on our assertion that ecologically based, large-scale systems of adaptation to the extreme changes in the ever-warming environment are necessary for collective survival and so must be invented. Seen metaphorically, two frontiers are emergent and evolving exponentially: One is a wave front of water, advancing on the edges of all continents that touch the oceans; the other is a heat wave that is increasingly (apparently slowly, but in fact exponentially) and covering, touching, and affecting the whole planet and the lives on it. These are different from all other frontiers that have been part of human experience, frontiers that we have advanced toward, most often by conquering or exploiting to our own advantage. These new frontiers move toward us, and our habitual responses of exploiting resources for production, consumption, and profit are no longer meaningful behaviors. Rather, we must adapt ourselves to meet these two frontiers on the scale on which they operate.\\" One of the Harrison Studio projects from 1993, entitled Serpentine Lattice, was quite successful. It was an installation that measured 10’x36′, and consisted of a dissolving slide mural of the disappearing North American Pacific Coast Temperate Rain Forest. The installation also included a 12’x36′ hand drawn map, text and forest image photo panels. At the time, 95% of the old forest growth had been harvested, and the cutting of the trees had left around 75 thousand miles of disturbed river and stream. The Studio created a design that would require controlling the high ground from the San Francisco Bay to Yakutat Bay in Alaska. This would create a scaffolding for the sustainable reclaiming of the Pacific Northwest Temperate Coastal Rain Forest. The main idea was to generate an eco-friendly security system, not too different from the social security system, and to use 1% of the Gross National Product to try and fight against the seemingly endless destruction of the environment. Included in this installation was a piece of writing to better explain their ideas and reasoning. This project took place at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Susan Fillin-Yeh supported the Harrisons in this endeavor. Douglas F. Cooley, from the Memorial Art Gallery of the college, commissioned the project. Serpentine Lattice is now in the permanent collection of the San Jose Museum of Art. Harrison Studio works are mainly done by invitation and commission. They often come when they are asked to begin research, propose ideas, and discuss with leaders in the area to try to make a change. They leave when they feel their work is done, or they have done all they are able to do.

LaRue (1746-1792) was a Kentucky pioneer and member of the LaRue family of Virginia. Biography John LaRue was the second child of Isaac and Phebe (Carman) LaRue, born in Frederick County, Virginia on January 24, 1746. He grew up on his father's farm, where there was plenty of work to be done, and few opportunities for acquiring an education. John owned land in Spottsylvania County, Virginia, and served as an officer in the Virginia Militia during the Revolutionary War. After leaving the militia, in 1779 John and his brother Samuel built a cabin along Guist Creek, about five miles north of Squire Boone's Station in what is now Shelby County, Kentucky. John married Mary Brooks (1766-1843) of Virginia in 1783 and took her back to Kentucky a year later, after selling his land in Spottsylvania County. They settled at Nolin Station, located at the mouth of Beach Fork, fifty miles from the station at the Falls of the Ohio, and about one mile from what would become the town of Hodgenville. Nolin Station was a small settlement and the site of a stockade fort, established just three years before in 1781. The fort was known as Phillips' Fort, because it was built on land owned by Phillip Phillips. With the help of Squire Boone, a prominent surveyor and brother of Daniel Boone, John acquired large tracts of lands in Shelby County and elsewhere, eventually laying claim to some 40,000 acres. John died on his plantation outside of Hodgenville on January 4, 1792, and was buried in the old Phillips Fort Cemetery. In 1843 the state legislature established LaRue County, Kentucky, which was named in honor of John by his grandson, John LaRue Helm, who was serving as the speaker of the house at the time. In 1809, John's widow, Mary, who by this time had remarried, served as the midwife for the birth Abraham Lincoln on the nearby Sinking Spring Farm.

The company specializes in short dental implants that use a locking taper or cold welding connection to secure the abutment to the implant. Bicon is notable and worthy of mention for the following three reasons: First, Bicon implants are extremely short in length. The size of Bicon implants allow them to be placed in regions that are crowded with natural teeth and/or implants, or in regions that would otherwise require bone grafting. Second, the implants do not have the screw-form design typical of other available implants. Third, the abutments are connected to the implant via a locking taper. This is notable from both a medical and engineering standpoint as no other implant company offers an implant with a biological seal at the implant/abutment interface; almost all other implants possess an internal screw to connect their abutments. History Bicon has been in operation since June 1994. Prior to Bicon, its main product line was under the ownership of two other entities, Driskell Bioengineering (1985–1987) and Stryker Corporation (1988–1994) of Kalamazoo Michigan. The following section briefly describes the history of the Bicon company and the dental implant products that it offers. = Vietnam War = The style of implant offered by Bicon can trace its provenance to the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, where in 1968 the US Army Medical Research and Development Command Dental Research Division funded a project aimed at developing prosthetics to address the influx of craniofacial injuries sustained by personnel in the escalating Vietnam War. Research performed by the implant's inventor, Thomas Driskell, showed that a multi- finned plateau design more effectively distributed occlusal forces to the underlying bone as compared to contemporary screw form implants. Using rhesus monkeys as an experimental animal, Driskell et al. were able to demonstrate direct bone-to-implant contact in the plateau style implant, a process called osseointegration. Furthermore, the implant designed by Driskell possessed a sloping shoulder that, in later years, would be shown to play a role in the maintenance of crestal bone height and a natural looking interdental papillae. With the advent of the 1970s, renewed interest in the use of ceramics began to develop. In 1975, Driskell et al. unveiled the Synthodont implant, an implant made of high density aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Unlike other conventional screw- type implants, the Synthodont implant design incorporated the use of the “fins” that had proved so successful in the U.S. Army project. Plateau Root Form (PRF) or \\"finned\\" dental implants of three different sizes. =1970s–1980s= In the late 1970s, following the initial successes of the Synthodont implant, Driskell et al. introduced the Titanodont implant. The Titanodont implant was composed of surgical grade titanium (grade 5, Ti-6Al-4V). The Titanodont implant was unique for three main reasons. First, the Titanodont implant allowed for complete interchangeability with abutments of varying diameters and angles. This interchangeability allowed for a more natural biological width. Second, the implant was grit blasted and acid etched, which provided both a larger surface area and preferable substrate for cells involved in osseointegration. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the Titanodont implant had a locking taper abutment connection, which allowed 360° of abutment positioning, along with a bacterial seal. Unlike screw-form implants, the locking taper connection design prevents the infiltration of bacteria into the implant crypt and surrounding tissues. =1980s–1990s= In the mid 1980s, Driskell and his partners formed a company called DB Bioengineering. DB Bioengineering received pre-market notification in October, 1985 for the implant Driskell and his team had developed at Batelle – now known as the DB Precision Fin Implant System. Two short years later, in 1987, DB engineering – along with the DB Precision Fin Implant System – were sold to the multinational conglomerate, the Stryker Corporation. At this juncture, the DB Precision Fin Implant System possessed the qualities that separated it (along with modern Bicon implants) from its competitors: a sloping shoulder, specialized titanium instrumentation, and a slow speed drilling system. Slow speed drilling was included in order to prevent the thermal damage induced by the high speeds conventional drilling. =1990s – Present day= Following its purchase from DB Bioengineering, Stryker held control of the DB Precision Fin Implant System for 7 years. Owing to its large size, as well as being more accustomed to dealing with purchasing agents at large hospitals, Stryker lacked the infrastructure necessary for direct interaction and sales with private practice dentists. In late 1993, Stryker made plans to sell the DB Precision Fin Implant System. Catching wind of the sale, Dr. Vincent Morgan (current owner and president of the company) along with other business partners, formed a group whose purpose was the acquisition of the implant system. In 1994, Stryker sold the DB Precision Fin Implant System to a group based in Boston which, at that point in time, had been renamed Bicon Dental Implants or simply Bicon (a name that is a portmanteau of the Latin “bi” – meaning two – and “con” – indicating the simple two-part design of the implant/abutment connection). Bicon's headquarters are located in Jamaica Plain, a historic neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts. The company employs 200 people and offers their implant system in 77 countries. Reception Bicon has been called “the smallest of the large implant companies.” Manufactured in the United States for over 30 years, Bicon implants have been generally well received. Because Bicon implants utilize a unique press-fit system instead of a screw, many clinicians have been hesitant to implement their use. Other clinicians praise the Bicon implant design for both its ease of use, versatility, and cost effectiveness. Like other dental companies that use or have used hydroxyapatite coated implants or hydroxyapatite derivatives (e.g. Zimmer, Straumann, Nobel Biocare, Dentsply, etc.), Bicon too has been criticized for the use of hydroxyapatite. Bicon implants have also been criticized for their small size; however, following a series of scientific studies, these concerns were shown to have been unwarranted. Unbeknownst to its creators at the time, the Bicon implant design (i.e. namely the use of fins or plateaus, along with a hemispherical base) took advantage of a biological phenomenon called load bearing platform switching (LBPS). Briefly, platform switching occurs when the diameters of the implant and abutment are unequal. LBPS results when the hemispherical base of the abutment generates a load onto the tissue below it. This mechanical stimuli induces bone repair and maintenance and results in crestal bone gain coronal to the implant. Bicon dental implants have been successfully functioning in patients since the inception of the product line in 1985. Implants retrieved after 18 years show evidence of lamellar bone consisting of multiple layers and multiple osteonic structures. Depending on the surgical procedure, implant size, implant coating, and patient, the long-term survival rate for Bicon dental implants ranges from 92.2% to 100%. Products In addition to dental implants, Bicon also offers implant-abutments, β-tricalcium phosphate,K. Müller:Klinische Erfahrung mit Beta-Tricalciumphosphat in der oralen Chirurgie. Quintessenz zahnärztl.Lit. Nr. 4/5 1985 and other dental restorative materials. As mentioned in the introduction, one of the reasons Bicon implants are notable (and also a source of criticism) is because of their small size. Bicon implants – referred to as short or ultrashort – can be as short as 5.0 mm. This allows the implants to be placed in regions that would otherwise require a sinus lift or bone graft.

It includes eleven middens in all, including the well-known Whaleback Shell Midden and the Glidden Midden, which is the largest shell midden in the northeastern United States. The area has the largest concentration of such midden sites under conservation protection in the eastern United States.Spiess, Arthur and Cranmer, Leon (1997). National Register nomination for Damariscotta Shell Middens Historic District; redacted version available by request from the National Park Service The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description The Damariscotta River is a tidal river that runs south through central Lincoln County, Maine. Its upper reaches (below Damariscotta Falls) are flanked by the towns of Newcastle on the west and Nobleboro and Damariscotta on the east. The river banks in this area remained largely undeveloped by European settlers (who first arrived in 1640) until the 19th century, when much land was cleared for agriculture. Since then, the land above the town centers of Damariscotta and Edgecomb (located on United States Route 1 on opposite sides of the river) has gradually become reforested. Located on this stretch of river bank, now largely in the hands of the state or conservation organizations, are eleven shell middens. Two of these are famous: the Whaleback Shell Midden, now part of a state historic site, was the east coast's largest shell midden until it was commercially excavated for lime in the late 19th century. Opposite it stands the Glidden Midden, now the largest midden, which escaped that fate because its owner refused permission for commercial excavation. The Whaleback Midden commercial activity was observed by archaeologists, with samples, artifacts, and drawings of the midden cross-sections forming part of its historic record. It was again examined by the state in 1996. Maine Survey Site 26.15 is also particularly noteworthy. It is located on a point of land, with deposits more than deep. Archaeologists have recovered stone tools, bone fragments, ceramic artifacts, and fire-cracked rocks from within the midden matrix, evidence of human habitation and activity. Most of this midden consists of oyster shells, which were harvested in the winter and spring. The other eight middens are all roughly dated, like the first three, to Maine's Middle Ceramic Period. Some of them are subjected to erosive forces due to their location on the banks of the river, while others have had their upper layers damaged by agricultural activity. The historic district includes one non-midden site, Maine Survey 26.47, which includes an Indian burial mound where at least one set of remains was found, as well as stone artifacts. All of these sites are owned by either the state or the Damariscotta River Association.

Web. It is very similar to pine-oak gall rust, but its second host is another Pinus species. The fungal infection results in gall formation on branches or trunks of infected hosts. Gall formation is typically not detrimental to old trees, but has been known to kill younger, less stable saplings.Pomerleau, Rene. \\"The Spherical Gall Rust of Jack Pine.\\" Mycologia 34.2 (1942): 120. Web. Galls can vary from small growths on branch extremities to grapefruit-sized galls on trunks. Hosts and symptoms The hosts of the aecial stage of the fungus includes two and three needled Pinus spp. The most important aecial hosts include jack pine (P. banksiana), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), western yellow pine (P. ponderosa), and the European Scots pine (P. sylvestris).\\"Pine-oak Gall Rust and Pine-pine Gall Rust.\\" Pine-oak and Pine-pine Gall Rusts. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2014. A variety of other pines, such as Pinus nigra, P. mugo, P. palustris, P. banksiana, P. muricata, and P. radiata have also been reported as hosts to pine-pine gall rust (E. harknessii), but these pine species are considered less valuable. Because E. harknessii is an autoecious short-cycle rust lacking telial a host, there is no alternative hosts. The pathogen can infect actively growing shoots of any age very quickly without infecting an alternative host, making the disease cycle more destructive that typical rust species that switch between hosts. This also prevents control of the fungus by management of the alternative host species. Symptoms of pine- pine gall rust can be quite conspicuous and are useful for diagnostic identification.Pine-Pine Gall Rust: Endocronartium harknessii. Cornell Department of Plant Pathology and Plant Microbe Biology http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/factsheets/pinepinegallrust.pdf The most prominent symptoms are hip cankers and swollen, spherical to oblong growths (galls) on the branches, stems, or main trunk of the host. The galls on small twigs of 1–2 years of age are often pear-shaped. Gall formation results from the overproduction of xylem tissue stimulated by the fungus.Western Gall Rust. Portland, Or.: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Region, 1983. Web. Witches brooming occasionally occurs along with galling. The bark on large galls will slough off over time, exposing the smooth wood beneath. Signs of pine-pine gall rust include the pale yellow aecia (1-8mm in diameter) formed on galls in spring as well as the yellow-orange aeciospores contained within. Immature galls are spindle-shaped. Infections usually occur on more succulent (thick) branches. When mature, galls can grow as large as a softball (30.5 cm circumference), but most are the size of a golf ball (4.2 cm). Before the production of spores, the needles on highly infected branches become chlorotic or red, eventually turning brown when the branch dies. Western gall rust can cause dwarfing to occur if leader stem of younger pines are infected. Early identification of the disease is important for treatment, but is often hard to diagnose due to the inconspicuous initial symptoms and a lack of galls until the second year. A red pigmentation may develop on the epidermal galls of P. contorta seedlings 14–28 days after infection, but this is not always a reliable indicator. Disease Cycle Pine-pine gall rust has characteristically brown to yellow-orange sori visible on large globular galls on pines. Gall formation on trunks occurs over 2–4 years and is stimulated by the pathogen, which causes cells to grow and divide quickly at the site of initial infection. When mature, the gall splits open and the yellow-orange aeciospores are dispersed and carried to new hosts by wind. Because P. harknessii does not require an alternate host, the aeciospores can infect another pine directly.\\"Region 10 - Forest & Grassland Health.\\" Region 10 - Forest & Grassland Health. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2014. This typically occurs during moist conditions and rarely infects older shoots. Infection continues on the host shoots and needles until they have reached 90% of their elongation. Gall mortality is associated with squirrel feeding or invasion and inactivation by secondary organisms. The life cycle of E. Harknessii is different from other pine stem rust in that it is autoecious, making large stands of pines ideal hosts for survival and reproduction of the fungus. Wind carries teliospores to pines shoots that then germinate under cool humid conditions, producing germ tubes with up to three side branches that act as basidia. The basidium directly penetrate the cuticle and epidermis. Other pines rusts like Cronartium ribicola and C. comandrae infect through the stomata. After penetration and establishment of a intracellular infection structure, primary hyphae are produced, infecting the epidermis and cortex intercellularly. Haustoria extend through neighboring cells and the cortex to reach the vascular cambium before the host becomes dormant follow the first infection season. The cambium is invade inwardly through the phloem and cortex, as opposed to a vertical or peripheral hyphael growth. Initiation of gall formation is through exogenous stimulation of the cambium and pith rays, causing an increased production of ray parenchyma. The host reacts by hyperplasia (increased division) providing the resources needed for further hyphae proliferation in the cortex, phloem, and cambium until the galls death. The gall will enlarge for 2 years and sporulate on the third. Spermogonia ooze from infected bark in early spring, but they are non-functional since they do not form aecia (vestigial). Dikaryotization of the haploid mycelium that produce the teliospores takes place in the outer cortex, just beneath the first periderm. They are surrounded by a membrane called a peridium that bursts, releasing the spores. Stimulation of dikaryotization is not understood, though it is likely a combination of host sap flow and environmental cues. Environment Damp surfaces on these pine trees provide an environment conducive to spore germination; these surfaces are usually found on very young tissue of the current season's growth.http://treedoctor.anr.msu.edu/Feb12_GallRustofPines.pdf The proper conditions must persist for at least 24 hours after the spore lands on its host in order to allow enough time for germination, penetration of host defenses, and establishment of the fungus. Environmental conditions conducive to infection typically occur during spring and early summer when weather is consistently cool and moist. Because of the very specific conditions required for spore germination and infection, pine-pine gall rust may not be observed in consecutive years as it is unlikely that optimal weather conditions and susceptible host tissue are both present at the time of spore release. Furthermore, infection severity is not uniform year after year. Only minor infections occur in an ordinary year, however infection may be prolific in certain years if the proper conditions occur. These years of abundant infection are termed \\"wave years\\" and are characterized by consistent cool, wet conditions and the increased local sporulation E. harknessii. Favorable conditions for large outbreaks of pine-pine gall rust do not occur often, but when they do they can affect areas as large as an entire state. Localized outbreaks are much more common, occurring in dense even-aged stands. Management Good cultural practices to prevent pine-pine gall rust include removal of dense patches of grasses, weeds, and brush near susceptible trees, as they may prevent good spray coverage of the lower whorl (spiraling pattern) of branches. Severely infected trees should be rogued and burned to prevent further spread of inoculum.\\"Western Gall Rust - Field Guide to Insects and Diseases of AZ and NM Forests.\\" Western Gall Rust - Field Guide to Insects and Diseases of AZ and NM Forests. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2014. It is often difficult to detect infection in trees before symptoms such as stunting, chlorosis, and witch's brooming are evident. Until all diseased trees in the area are diagnosed and destroyed it is suggested that a protectant fungicide be applied to all susceptible trees in the stand. Using a registered systemic fungicide such as Bayleton (50% Dry Flowable Fungicide, EPA Reg. No. 2135-32 ) registered in California can help control western gall rust, although it is not used on seeds or seedlings and may kill mycorrhizal fungi if advised application concentration is exceeded. If trees in a commercial stand are only lightly infected it is possible to prevent an increase in galling by applying a fungicidal spray, allowing the tree to reach cutting age so that it may be harvested. Copper-based and manganese-based fungicides have proven effective in the field but the sensitivity of P. harnknessii to these fungicides has not yet been researched in a laboratory setting.http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2007_ramsfield_t001.pdf It has been demonstrated that development of the rust fungus is closely synchronized with Pinus sylvestris. Spore dissemination begins when needles start to emerge from the fascicle sheaths and has finished when the needles have grown to three-quarters of their final length. This provides a basis for the timing of the application of fungicides either before or during sporulation, depending on the chemicals mode of action. Other chemical applications like Armada 50 WDG at 9 oz/100 gal water or Dithane M45 at 2 to 4 lb/A or per 100 gal water to protect bud breakthrough in seedlings that would have severely altered growth and diminished marketability. Although pruning infected stems from the tree may lower the initial inoculum, it provided little benefit to lesioned branches as they often die. The best time to prune is during the late dormant seasons like winter when insects and infections are less likely. For infections during warmer weathered seasons, apply. If left untouched, branches with galls will eventually become necrotic. Infected tissue that has not been removed will continue to sporulate until the host tissue has dried out. There is also some evidence that rodents strip the wood from galls, but it is uncommon to see this result in further spread of the disease or death of the gall. Insects frequently associate with the gall rust as well. Some feed on the aeciospores and can negatively impact the fungus’ survival while other insects, like the red turpentine beetle, can carry spores to other trees. Large populations of the beneficial insects in the environment could potentially aid in suppressing a large outbreak of pine-pine gall rust. Importance Pine-pine gall rust is especially important in areas containing large stands of pine species due to ability of the causal fungus to infect other pines without first infecting an alternate host. Pine-pine gall rust is economically significant because of its detrimental effects on lumber content, quality, and growth rate. Though the disease is not known to wipe out entire stands, it can kill individual trees. Due to the density of trees within managed stands on tree farms the disease can be much more severe. Pine-pine gall rust is also an important disease for nursery owners growing pines to look out for because young trees and seedlings are particularly susceptible. Severe outbreaks in natural stands and plantations of P. contorta, P. ponderosa, P. banksiana, and P. sylvestris have been observed in regions of Canada. In the US, the most significant damage occurs in commercial stands of P. contorta in the Rocky Mountains. The disease is also significant due to its negative impact on the aesthetic quality of specimen trees in public gardens, arboretums, and residential areas. Christmas tree farms growing Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra, and P. ponderosa are also at high risk of infection. True epidemics of pine-pine gall rust are rare, occurring only in years when susceptible hosts, virulent pathogens, and proper environmental conditions are present simultaneously.

Her body was quickly found but remained unidentified until a 2014 DNA test, after an amateur Internet researcher suggested a match between the Texas unidentified decedent and Connecticut missing-person data. Circumstances Michelle Garvey went missing from New London, Connecticut, presumably after running away from home, on June 1, 1982, at the age of fourteen. She was believed to have intended to return to her birth state, New Jersey, or to North Carolina. She had a previous history of running away, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Initially, it was unknown what had happened to Garvey, as she may have left home to start a new life and was thought to have possibly been still alive. Discovery Artist's impression of what the then-unidentified Garvey looked like in life Garvey's body was found on July 1, 1982, in Baytown, Texas, one month after she went missing. Authorities were unable to identify her body, but could determine that the victim was a white female between fifteen and twenty years old with blue eyes and curly red hair. The cause of death of the victim was determined to be strangulation. The girl also had an inverted left nipple, O-positive blood type, a scar on one foot, was approximately five feet one inch to tall, and had one of her ears pierced. Her body was found wearing brown clothing, including a long-sleeved, button-down shirt with a distinct horse embroidery on the breast pocket. Her pants were made of corduroy material. The body was disposed of in a field after she died, possibly merely hours after her murder. She was buried near two other unidentified murder victims, the Harris County Does. There was evidence that Garvey had been sexually assaulted. No bra or shoes were recovered and the shirt had also been unbuttoned. Identification The body was exhumed in May 2011 to obtain a DNA profile to compare to potential matches, including Garvey's brother. An amateur online sleuth, Polly Penwell, came across the cases of Garvey and the unidentified body and suggested to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and the Harris County medical examiner that they could be the same person after she compared both cases, while using a website known as Websleuths. Penwell said, describing her interest in unidentified people, \\"I felt so much sadness for them. I've always been very sensitive – compassionate, I guess – even as a little kid.\\" Garvey was identified in January 2014, through the efforts of NCMEC and by the Harris County Police Department, who had contacted her family and obtained samples of their DNA for testing in August 2013, to add to an old sample taken from her brother, which had previously been submitted to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System and analyzed by the University of North Texas. She had remained unidentified for 31 years; Garvey was fourteen when she disappeared from Connecticut, and was fifteen at the time of her death, more than half-way across the country. Since her identification, authorities have continued their investigation, now aimed at finding Garvey's murderer. It was revealed that Garvey likely ran away from home, escaping through a window, then probably hitched a ride with an unknown driver. Authorities expressed interest in how the victim arrived in Texas and what the motive for her murder may have been, as well as who may have transported her to where she later died. Her case was also possibly connected to other \\"Texas Killing Fields\\" murders, although no link has been officially determined. After being returned from Texas to Connecticut, Garvey's body was reburied by her family on March 1, 2014, in Montville, Connecticut.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, and sewing instructor at Atlanta's Evening School) and Jefferson Sigman Ward (graduate of the Haynes Institute in Augusta, GA, World War I veteran, Pullman porter and small businessman), Ward demonstrated musical prowess, including the ability to memorize tunes, from two years of age. As a four-year-old kindergartner at Atlanta's Oglethorpe School, he attracted his teacher's attention when he played the hymn \\"Just as I Am\\" in thirds on the classroom toy piano. He began formal music lessons when he entered first grade and within a year was playing complete sonatas. By the age of 10, Ward was accompanying the church choir and performing throughout Atlanta. Dr. Calvin Edouard Ward in 2011, photo by Vincent Bryant After graduating from high school, Ward studied piano at Morehouse College, then served for two years in the United States Army, rising to the rank of sergeant chaplain's assistant. Resuming music studies, he earned Bachelor of Music in pipe organ performance in 1949 and Master of Music in choral performance in 1950. Ward taught at Florida A&M; University and served as University Organist from 1950-1951. Ward received a Fulbright Fellowship to study organ at the Staatsakademie und Hochschule für Musik und darstellende Kunst in Vienna, Austria, and earned his Doktorat in Musical Research from the University of Vienna in 1955. Ward taught at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana from 1957 to 1958, and was chair of the Department of Music and Fine Arts at South Carolina State College from 1959 to 1961. He taught at Kingsborough Community College in New York for two years. From 1968 to 1972, he conducted the choir and chaired the Department of Music at the Tuskeegee Institute. He taught music theory, applied organ and African-American classical music at the Peabody Conservatory of Music at Johns Hopkins from 1972 to 1977, and later taught as an adjunct at the University of Maryland at Baltimore and at Coppin State College. In 1977, a Fulbright-Hays fellowship provided the opportunity to do research in Paris, France and Lambaréné, French Equatorial Africa. Ward was a guest lecturer at Cuttington University College in the Republic of Liberia in 1979, and was a Phelps-Stokes African-American Exchange Scholar at Kenyatta University College in Nairobi, Kenya. In 1986 he became the first Fulbright fellow to both lecture and perform. He was the first African-American visiting professor and co-conductor of the choir at the State Conservatory of Music in Vilnius, Lithuania and the first American guest conductor/lecturer of the Ave Sol Choir at the State Conservatory of Music in Riga, Latvia. He was the first American to perform on the Riga Cathedral's renowned Walcker pipe organ. Ward traveled to the St. Petersburg State Conservatory in the USSR, where he lectured in African-American classical composers, and to St. John's Theological College in New South Wales, Australia in 1990. In 1998, he accompanied the Street Theatre Dance Ensemble on piano in concerts at the Island Center for the Performing Arts in St. Croix, Virgin Islands. Ward administered music activities for the Trenton, NJ public school system from 1991 to 1995, and conducted vocal music workshops for teachers and students.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Miscellany 14 Distinguishing features Vermilacinia paleoderma is distinguished by its thallus divided into relatively long tubular-prismatic branches—to 6 cm long in contrast to 4 cm long in V. combeoides—that arise from a common base, the branches generally of longitudinal spiraled cortical ribs with recessed crater-like depression between the ribs; the craters frequently separated by transverse pastry-like creases, which gives the overall prismatic appearance to the branches. Primary branches vary from less than 5 to more than 20, simple or often divided well above base into equal secondary branches, or with many shorter branches developing along one side when the primary branches spread out and curve upwards towards light. Black pycnidia are conspicuous on the branches, giving the thallus the appearance of having the measles except for the black color. Apothecia usually develop terminally on some branches, often in small aggregates. Lichen substances are primarily three terpenoid compounds, T3, zeorin and (-)-16 α-hydroxykaurane; bougeanic acid undoubtedly present; salazinic acid occasionally present. Vermilacinia paleoderma is perhaps the most common species in the subgenus Vermilacinia on rocks near the immediate coast of the Baja California peninsula, from Punta Canoas south to Miller’s Landing. It occurs sporadically on the Vizcaíno Peninsula and offshore islands, namely Guadalupe Island, Islas San Benito, Isla San Martín (near San Quintín), and in the Channel Islands. It often grows in small tufts with species of Niebla, or in extensive pure colonies on rock outcrops on ridges that receive more fog from ocean wind Taxonomic History Although Vermilacinia paleoderma is widely distributed, it had remained unknown until 1996. In 1994, two closely related species were described; Vermilacinia cedrosensis was first distinguished (as Niebla cedrosensis) from thalli growing on Cedros Island by the cylindrical shape of the branches, and recognized to also occur on the Vizcaíno Peninsula at Punta Eugenia,Marsh, J. & T. H. Nash, III. 1994. A new lichen species, Niebla cedrosensis, is described from Baja California, Mexico. Phytologia 76: 458-460. in contrast to Vermilacinia polymorpha (synonym Niebla polymorpha) distinguished by its irregularly dilated branch segments, based on specimens from Santa Catalina Island and nearby California mainland. Both species that were originally described in the genus Niebla in 1994 were transferred to Vermilacinia in 1996,Bowler, P. A., R. E. Riefner, Jr., P. W. Rundel, J. Marsh & T.H. Nash, III. 1994.

Marsh. 2004. \\"Niebla\\". ‘Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2’: 368–380. however, V. paleoderma was placed in synonymy under Niebla laevigata, a species that has mostly flattened branches, in contrast to the diagnostic features of “sublinear branches” given for the species in 1996. Another closely related species, V. reptilioderma, which differs by chemistry in having the tripterpenes, referred to as T1 and T2 by where they form spots on thin-layer chromatography plates, was considered a synonym of Niebla cedrosensis. The genus Niebla differs in having free chondroid strands in the medulla and by lichen substances primarily of depsides (divaricatic acid or sekikaic acid with accessory treterpenes), and depsidones (salazinic acid or hyprotocetraric acid or protocetraric acid or acid deficient, without accessory triterpenes); the terpenes when present are not the triterpene zeorin and the diterpene (-)-16 α-hydroxykaurane that characterizes the genus Vermilacinia. It was stated by Darrell WrightWright, D. 1995. A Simplified TLC Method. Bull. Calif. Lichen Soc.2. “that not one of the eight substances found in N. laevigata [= Vermilacinia laevigata] appears to correspond to any of the seven substances in its congener, N. homalea.” Additionally, cortical differences were described by Peter Bowler: as (1) a “thick outer cortex with palisade cell lines and a subtending layer of supportive tissue,” \\"Bowler, P.A. 1981. Cortical diversity in the Ramalinaceae. Can. J. Bot. 59: 437–453. corresponding to the genus Niebla, (2) “a thin cortex of branching hyphae in a matrix with mechanical tissue either absent or sparsely present,” corresponding to subgenus Cylindricaria, and (3), cortex “a thick mechanical layer and a variable palisade layer,” corresponding to subgenus Vermilacinia.

Review: linked lists (Singly) linked lists are fundamental data structures that are widely used as is, or to build other data structures. They consist of \\"nodes\\", or \\"links\\", that are put in some order indicated by a \\"next\\" pointer on each node. The last node in the list (the \\"tail\\") has a next pointer. The first node (the \\"head\\") is a sentinel: it stores no interesting information and is only used for its pointer. The operations that must be supported on lists are as follows. * Given a node that is not yet part of the list, and a pointer to a node in the list (perhaps the head), insert after . * Given a pointer , delete from the list. Both operations must support concurrent use: two or more threads of execution must be able to perform insertions and deletions without interfering with each other's work (see diagram). Harris's solution A linked list in an inconsistent state, caused by application of the naive lock-free deletion algorithm. Dotted lines are links that exist in intermediate states; solid lines represent the final state. Deletion of the node holding has executed simultaneously with insertion of after , causing the insertion to be undone. In a 2001 paper, Harris gives a solution to concurrent linked list maintenance that is non-blocking, using a compare-and-swap () primitive. Insertion of after is simple: # # # # If the was not successful, go back to 1. Deletion of is more involved. The naive solution of resetting this pointer with a single CAS runs the risk of losing data when another thread is simultaneously inserting (see diagram). Instead, two invocations of are needed for a correct algorithm. The first marks the pointer as deleted, changing its value but in such a way that the original pointer can still be reconstructed. The second actually deletes the node by resetting .

It is located at the former Ohel Moshe or Moishe Synagogue, in the Tilanqiao Historic Area of Hongkou district, Shanghai, China. The museum features documents, photographs, films, and personal items documenting the lives of some of the more than 20,000 Jewish residents of the Restricted Sector for Stateless Refugees, better known as the Shanghai Ghetto, during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Background The museum is situated in what was once the Jewish Quarter of Shanghai, which had had a Jewish community since the late 19th century, in Hongkou District (formerly rendered as \\"Hongkew\\"). After the 1937 Battle of Shanghai, Japan occupied the Chinese sections of Shanghai, but the foreign concessions—the Shanghai International Settlement and the Shanghai French Concession—were still under the control of the European powers. In the 1930s, Nazi Germany encouraged German and Austrian Jews to emigrate, but most countries closed their borders to them, Shanghai and the Dominican Republic being the only exceptions. 20,000 European Jews sought refuge in Shanghai, which did not require a visa to enter, the most of any city in the world. The Ohel Moshe Synagogue was the primary place of worship for the Jewish refugees in Shanghai. Soon after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and declared war on the allies, Japan invaded Shanghai's foreign concessions and occupied the whole city. The war ended the flow of American funds to the impoverished Jewish refugees. The Japanese imposed restrictions on the Jews, and in 1943 officially established the Restricted Sector for Stateless Refugees, better known as the Shanghai Ghetto, in Hongkou, forcing most Jews to live there. After World War II, China soon fell into a civil war, which ended in the victory of the Communist Party in 1949, and almost all the Shanghai Jews emigrated by 1956.  Ohel Moshe Synagogue  A closeup view of the synagogue The Ohel Moshe congregation was established by Russian Jewish immigrants in Shanghai in 1907. This Ashkenazi congregation was named after Moshe Greenberg, a member of the Russian Jewish community, and was first established in a rented space. As the congregation grew to 250 families by the 1920s, Rabbi Meir Ashkenazi, Chief Rabbi of Shanghai, supported the creation of a new space for the congregation. In 1927, the current structure was created by remodeling an existing three-story building in the Hongkou District, removing the second floor and adding a mezzanine. The synagogue is situated on what was once Ward Road (now Changyang Road), close to the Ward Road Gaol (now Tilanqiao Prison). The synagogue was confiscated by the government after the communist takeover in 1949 and converted into a psychiatric hospital. It was also used for office space. It reopened in the 1990s. Ohel Moshe and Ohel Rachel are the only two Jewish temples of old Shanghai that still stand, out of the original six. In 2004, the Ohel Moshe Synagogue was inscribed on the list of architectural heritage treasures of Shanghai. In 2007, the Government of Hongkou District restored the synagogue to its original architectural style based on the original drawings in the municipal archives, and opened it as a museum commemorating the Jewish refugees. Some of the residential buildings from the ghetto period still stand around the former synagogue, though most have been demolished. The museum itself, and the remaining historic structures, are preserved as part of the Tilanqiao Historic Area. Monument In 2014 the museum unveiled a monument to the refugees, which includes more than 13,000 names and a memorial statue commemorating their experience. The memorial was designed by artist He Ning. Monument on display at the entrance to the museum, with Chinese flag. Exhibits A Jewish girl and her Chinese friends in the Shanghai Ghetto, from the collection of the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum The Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum encompasses the Ohel Moshe Synagogue building, two additional exhibition halls, and a courtyard. The synagogue exhibition presents a \\"small collection of artifacts\\" depicting the lives of Jewish refugees who found shelter in Shanghai during the Holocaust. One exhibit on the second floor of the synagogue is devoted to the life of the Chief Rabbi of Shanghai, Rabbi Meir Ashkenazi. While the synagogue still contains a Torah ark, Ark cover, and reader's platform, it does not have a Torah scroll or prayer books, precluding its use for prayer services. The No. 2 Exhibition Hall, completed in 2007, displays more than 140 historical photographs and other artifacts including artworks, a refugee's passport, copies of the Shanghai Jewish Chronicle, and a stone tablet engraved with the words of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin during his visit to Shanghai. A documentary film about the refugees is also shown in the hall. The No. 3 Exhibition Hall was completed in May 2008, and is used for temporary exhibits. In September 2014, a long copper memorial wall was unveiled at the site, engraved with the names of 13,732 Jewish refugees harbored in China during World War II.

History  The Retribution Army was originally founded in Deir ez-Zor by Sunni Arabs and took part in the three-way battle for the city between loosely allied rebel factions, the Syrian Armed Forces, and ISIL. When the FSA units in Deir ez-Zor were overrun by ISIL in mid-2014, surviving remnants of the Retribution Army retreated north into areas held by the People's Protection Units (YPG). Eventually relocating to Kobanî Canton, the Retribution Army became a founding member of the Euphrates Volcano operations room in September 2014. The group then took part in the defence of the town of Kobanî against the siege by ISIL, and continued to fight with the YPG and its allies until mid-2015. At the time led by Abu Ali, a former primary schoolteacher, they took part in the Tell Abyad offensive. After Tell Abyad was captured, however, disputes erupted between the Retribution Army and the YPG. Abu Ali later claimed that his men had hoisted the Syrian Independence flag over the city per a previous agreement, but it was taken down and replaced by the YPG banner. Feeling insulted, the Retribution Army then left Euphrates Volcano and went to Turkey. There, Abu Ali said in an interview that the Syrian Kurds are \\"like the devil\\", though admitted that many other FSA units remained allied to the YPG. Though Abu Ali claimed that the Retribution Army would continue to fight in Syria at another front after \\"some much-needed rest\\", the unit has not resurfaced since.

History  The history of the Swiss in Guatemala dates back to the 19th century, with the first wave of immigration culminating in the Swiss government opening a consulate in 1891. The majority of immigrants from this first wave originated from Geneva and settled primarily in Guatemala City, with some additional settlement in the surrounding highlands. Switzerland and Guatemala have sustained a committed trade partnership that began during this time period.La Hora, Permanencia de Suiza en Guatemala Guatemala, 23 Agost 2014.

Built in 1946, it was founded as Orthodox. In 1950 the Rabbi was Harry Zwick, and congregation officers were: president Isadore Spitulnik, vice-president Louis Eisenberg MD, financial secretary Joseph Cropp, recording secretary Edward Schulimson, treasurer Hyman Jacobsen. Temple Beth-El was unable to support a full-time rabbi following Hornell's economic and demographic collapse after the closure of the Erie Railroad's repair shops, its main industry, in 1960. It operated briefly as a Conservative congregation, but is currently (2014) inactive. In 2010 it was a target for graffiti, a red pentagon and the initials FBG sprayed on the side. The building reflects the pattern of Jewish settlement seen in small towns across New York State in the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and illustrates the economic, social, and cultural impact this ethnic and religious group made to the community. Previous to the synagogue, the congregation worshiped in local homes and later the Erlich Hebrew Center, a Jewish center established in a downtown commercial building (converted into studios for WLEA after the Jewish community moved out). After World War II, the center proved to be inadequate and the congregation pooled its resources. Renamed Temple Beth-El, the congregation was able to build its own house of worship near the center of the city where other religious houses of worship were prominently sited. Design and construction were guided by a building committee and the synagogue was dedicated in 1947. The only change made to the building since its dedication was a new roof and ceiling in the worship space in 1976. The presence of the synagogue reinforces the fact that the congregation was and still is part of the Hornell community.https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/16000021.htm In 2016 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is situated on the London road in the centre of the town. It was built in 1836 and is a Grade II listed building. History It was built in 1836, seven years after the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829, and fourteen years before the Restoration of the English hierarchy in 1850. As there were no dioceses in England at the time, the church came under the administration of the Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District. It was built in a classical revival style of architecture, similar to Chipping Norton Town Hall. From 1922 until 1969, Heythrop Park, a country house in the parish, was occupied by the Society of Jesus. During that time, Heythrop Hall was a philosophy and theology college for those studying to become Jesuits. While they were there, the Jesuits also staffed Holy Trinity church. After they left, the church reverted to the care of the Archdiocese of Birmingham, who continue to serve the parish.Arkell, W.J.

Bishop Mark Jabale inducted as Parish Priest from Independent Catholic News, 17 March 2009, retrieved 25 November 2014 Architecture The church is made of rubble stone at the rear side and ashlar to the other sides. There are three round headed windows on either side of the nave of the church. There is a gallery in the west part of the church and a stained glass window behind the altar made in 1873. There are two doorways on the side of the church facing the road, above them are bays in the façade. Above the bays and the windows is a coved cornice. There are porches projecting out at either side with antae, sunburst shells and ammonite scrolls in the stonework. Parish There are two Sunday Masses held in the church, one is on Saturday evening at 6:00pm and the other is at 11am Sunday morning. The church has a relationship with the nearby Holy Trinity Catholic School.

Laundry Detergents, 4. Ecology and Toxicology. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. doi: 10.1002/14356007.o15_o15 Some laundry wastewater goes directly into the environment, due to the flaws of water infrastructure. The majority goes to sewage treatment plants before flowing into the environment. Some chemicals remain in the water after treatment, which may contaminate the water system. Some have argued they can be toxic to wildlife, or can lead to eutrophication. General influences of laundry wastewater Data show that United States has more than 35,000 laundries. On average, a single laundry can discharge 400 m3 of wastewater every day.Ciabattia, I., Cesaro, F., Faralli, L., Fatarella, E., & Tognotti, F. (2009). Demonstration of a treatment system for purification and reuse of laundry wastewater. Desalination, 245(1), 451-459. doi:10.1016/j.desal.2009.02.008 Annually, about 5.11 km3 laundry wastewater is produced, which can fill 1,460 Superdomes in New Orleans. =Treatment of laundry wastewater= There are several parameters in the evaluation of laundry wastewater: temperature, pH-value, suspended substances, Cl2, sediment substances, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrogen ammonia, chemical oxygen demand(COD), biochemical oxygen demand(BOD5), anionic surfactants.Šostar-Turk, S., Petrinić, I., & Simonič, M. (2005). Laundry wastewater treatment using coagulation and membrane filtration. Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 44(2), 185-196. doi:10.1016/j.resconrec.2004.11.002 =Chemicals in detergents= Several common detergent ingredients are surfactants, builders, bleach-active compounds and auxiliary agents. The surfactants can be classified into anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants. The most widely used surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) is an anionic surfactant. In builders, sodium triphosphate, zeolite A, sodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) are the most important substances. Bleach-active compounds are usually sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate. Enzymes and fluorescent whitening agents are added into detergents as auxiliary agents. Mechanism =Environmental harm of surfactants= Surfactants are surface active agents, as they have both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties and are widely used in various washing process. With the lipophilic tails, surfactants are biologically active. Anionic surfactants have the ability of binding to bioactive macromolecules like enzymes, DNA, peptides, causing changes of surface charge and the folding of polyp eptide chain(structure o different. Cationic surfactant can bind to the inner membrane of bacteria, and by this way disorganize the bacteria through their long alkyl chain. Nonionic surfactants are able to bind to both proteins and phospholipid membrane, leading to leakage of low molecular mass compounds by increasing the permeability of membranes and vesicles. This may result in serious damage in cells or even cell death.Ivanković, T., & Hrenović, J. (2010). Surfactants in the environment. Arhiv za higijenu rada i toksikologiju, 61(1), 95-109. doi: 10.2478/10004-1254-61-2010-1943 LAS and its biodegradation Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) with the formula of C12H25C6H4SO3Na, also known as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, is the most widely used anionic surfactant in laundry detergent because it has minimal environmental impact for its readily biodegradation. A complete biodegradation under aerobic conditions consists of two steps, primary biodegradation and ultimate biodegradation. The first step begins from the terminal carbon in the alkyl chain as omega-oxidation, which can start from one or both ends, then is followed by beta-oxidation. After the first step the residual is sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates (SP(d)Cs), a large molecule which can be involved in the second step. The second step occurs only when the required bacteria exist. The ring cleavage of benzene and the further desulphonation of the mono- and dicarboxylic sulphophenyl acids happen. After the two-step biodegradation, LAS is degraded into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic salts and residual biomass. During the biodegradation, several specific bacteria and oxygen are required in both omega-oxidation of the alkyl chain and the benzene ring cleaving process, so this biodegradation can only happen in aerobic conditions. In anaerobic conditions in treatment process, LAS shows no change. Researchers also prove that biodegradation process is restricted in 20–40 mg/L and even inhibited at a higher concentration, which leads to the incomplete biodegradation of LAS in sewage treatment plants.Patterson, D. A., Metcalfe, I. S., Xiong, F., & Livingston, A. G. (2001). Wet air oxidation of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate 1. Effect of temperature and pressure. Industrial & engineering chemistry research, 40(23), 5507-5516. doi: 10.1021/ie010293k Omega-oxidation of LAS biodegradationScott, Matthew J., and Malcolm N. Jones. \\"The biodegradation of surfactants in the environment.\\" Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes 1508.1 (2000): 235-251. doi:10.1016/S0304-4157(00)00013-7 Beta-oxidation of LAS biodegradation =Harm of builders to the environment= Builders in detergents are water softeners, which can remove calcium and magnesium ions by complexation or precipitation in hard water which contains high levels of calcium and magnesium. Sodium triphosphate, with a formula of Na5P3O10, is a largely used builder in laundry detergents, which can lead to eutrophication caused by phosphorus (P). P is needed for energy transfer, the formation of DNA, RNA and many other intermediary metabolites. Only P in orthophosphate can be assimilated by autotrophs, other P compounds like sodium triphosphate can be chemically or enzymatically hydrolyzed to orthophosphate.Correll, D. L. (1998). The role of phosphorus in the eutrophication of receiving waters: A review. Journal of Environmental Quality, 27(2), 261-266. doi:10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700020004x The mechanism is shown below.McComb, R. B., Bowers, G. N., & Posen, S. (1979). Alkaline phosphatase (p. 986). New York: Plenum Press. Degradation of sodium triphosphate with enzyme Excessive phosphorus can make for excessive production of autotrophs, like algae and cyanobacteria, leading to eutrophication in an inorganic nutrient pathway. Nutrient enrichment in lakes and reservoirs results in the microscopic floating plants, algae and formation of dense mats of larger floating plants that can produce oxygen by photosynthesis. When they die and sink to the bottom, they consume oxygen in decomposition. Bacteria thriving in this process consume oxygen. With the depletion of oxygen, fishes die and anaerobic bacteria produce methane, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which can destroy the ecosystem. Prevention To reduce the eutrophication caused by sodium triphosphate, there are phosphorus-free builders substitutes, such as inorganic builders zeolite A and soda ash, and organic builders like polycarboxylates, citrates et al.

The original house, which was designed by architects Davidson and Henderson, dates from 1866; subsequent additions and alterations were made in the late nineteenth century and in the 1900s-1910s. The homestead also comprises large formal gardens, a bakehouse and laundry, stables, coach-house and implement shed (south-west of the homestead), a woolshed, two bluestone cottages north-east of the homestead, and a ram shed located 1 km south. The property is strongly associated with the grazing history of the Western District, and prior to subdivision for soldier settlement in 1946, was the largest sheep station in Victoria. The homestead and outbuildings were listed on the Register of the National Estate on 14 May 1991; they are also classified by the National Trust of Australia and protected under the Golden Plains Shire Heritage Overlay. History The run on which the homestead sits was originally named The Long Waterhole. It was settled by Thomas Austin in 1846, who established a merino stud. It was sold to brothers Thomas and Philip Russell in 1851, who renamed the property Barunah Plains. The Weekly Times reported in 2000 that the Barunah Plains wool stud \\"has provided the genetic base for many of Australia's leading fine wool studs\\". At its peak, the station held over 50,000 sheep and was the largest sheep station in the state. It remained in the Russell family until 1978. Graham Mills bought the property from the Russell family in 1978, and subsequently restored the homestead and surrounds. In the early 1990s, GW Mills and sons decided that they needed an alternative source of income to supplement their wool business, and opened the property as tourist accommodation, using parts of the homestead, two cottages and the former shearers' quarters. In 1995, he added a 9-hole golf course, using the shearers' quarters as a clubhouse. The clubhouse was ranked by BRW as the fifth-best in Victoria in 1998; the course was then in the process of expansion. That year, the property had 11,000 sheep, crops of wheat, barley and oats, and the tourist business. In 1998, the local council approved plans to create a country-club development, motel and conference centre at the site, but this did not eventuate. In 1999, part of the property was sold off when the owners were unable to sell the property as a whole. It was bought by internet entrepreneur and politician Evan Thornley in 2001. He advertised the property for sale in 2012, at which time the Geelong Advertiser reported that potential buyers were visiting the property \\"in helicopters that cost almost half the property's $4.5 million-plus asking price.\\" Significance Barunah Plains is a late nineteenth-century homestead development and is important for exhibiting a rich array of cultural features as follows: a collection of bluestone buildings including the homestead and outbuildings; and a homestead garden and parkland with a large attractively crafted timber gate, a timber pedestrian bridge, shrubberies, a sunken croquet lawn, a rose garden and mature trees (Criterion A.3). Barunah Plains has a strong and long association with the grazing history of the western district, and thus with a major chapter of the history of Victoria (Criterion A.4). The range of structures on the property, including bakery, laundry, cottages, implement shed, stables, coach house, woolshed and ram building, is important for the way it reflects a functioning western district sheep property founded in the nineteenth century. Additionally, the ram shed and the gate providing entry to the garden and park are unusual features. The garden is also important as an example of the Gardenesque design style, exhibiting the following style characteristics: a dominance of shrubberies with minimal lawn area; use of gravel paths; and use of trees with distinctive form as features (Criterion B.2). Barunah Plains is important for technical and creative excellence exhibited in the evolved form of the bluestone house, the collection of substantial bluestone outbuildings, and in the 1890s garden design layout (Criterion F.1). Description Barunah Plains on the Hamilton Highway at Wingeel was established in the 1840s. Philip Russell, with John Simson and Thomas Russell, took over the property in 1851 and from 1856 Thomas, with other Russell family members, had the property. Barunah Plains remained in Russell family hands until 1978. The oldest section of the homestead (which contains main rooms) dates from 1866 and was designed by architects, Davidson and Henderson, who designed a number of homesteads and other buildings in this part of Victoria. Additions were made later in the nineteenth century and major additions and alterations date from the 1900s to the 1910s. These early twentieth century works included the western wing with its polygonal window, filling in of the central courtyard to create an enormous lantern lit room with two fireplaces and refitting of parts of the older house, such as leadlights in the front door surround. The dates of the various outbuildings are unknown. In 1904 it was stated that the Barunah Plains Merino flock was 'the most noted in the western district', comprising 50,000 sheep on the 51,000 acres. The ram building is one unusual manifestation of this once very large sheep property, evidently the largest in Victoria when it was subdivided for soldier settlement in 1946. Barunah Plains homestead is a large, single storey bluestone residence, comprising two main sections forming a U-shape around the rear courtyard, infilled in the 1900s to the 1910s. The eastern section of the building was built in 1866 to Davidson and Henderson's design. This eastern section is asymmetrically composed with a cast iron verandah at the north-east corner. The present front door faces east and is beside a projecting bay window and sheltered by a stone porch; this section may well be an addition. The north side elevation has a projecting bay windowed room with a higher roof crowned by cast iron cresting. Further west is the 1900s to the 1910s wing, comprising principal bedrooms and intact bathrooms. On the western side of the old courtyard is a bluestone section reputed to be the oldest part and a timber section. Immediately south of the rear of the house is the bluestone bakehouse and laundry. Further south again are the bluestone and timber station buildings, stables, coach house and implement shed, arranged to form a large courtyard. The garden encloses the homestead on the south, east, north and part of the west sides. Separating the garden and station outbuildings is a picket fence, which is the last surviving section of this fencing which was more extensive. The garden has a layout dating from at least the 1890s and has much mature planting. The garden originally extended to the other side of the Warrambine Creek, but became badly overgrown in recent times. Warrambine Creek runs along the north side of the garden, and a sunken croquet lawn is just north-east of the house. The garden has 2ha of informal area and parkland, and 3ha of formal garden which includes a rose garden, orchard, kitchen garden, various shrubberies with small trees, a variety of shrubs and perennials, and mature pines, monkey puzzle trees, and cypresses. The garden has an approach through and attractive old style timber gate, and also across a timber pedestrian bridge, spanning the creek. The T-shaped bluestone woolshed is on the other side of the creek, on a rise; its south wall is concealed by corrugated iron additions. There are two bluestone houses east of the woolshed, on the other side of the creek. The coursed bluestone ram shed has a slatted floor, with subfloor access doors below.

Early life  Serena Thorne was born in England at Shebbear, Devon. She was the daughter of Bible Christian Methodist preachers, Samuel and Mary Thorne. Her grandfather, William O’Bryan was the founder of the Bible Christian Church. Bible Christians allowed women preachers and by the age of 21 she was a widely known preacher through Devon, Cornwall and South Wales.  Australia  Serena Thorne was sent to preach and help establish Bible Christianity in Queensland, Australia in 1865 and in 1870 she was invited by Samuel Way and Dr Allan Campbell to preach at Bible Christian Churches in Adelaide, South Australia. She preached to large crowds in Adelaide and travelled widely amongst the parishes of South Australia. In March 1871 she married Reverend Octavius Lake (1841 – 9 September 1922), whom she had previously known in England. They were married by Rev. James Way in Samuel Way's house in Adelaide on 2 March 1871. Between 1873 and 1883 she gave birth to seven children only one of whom survived to adulthood. Women's Suffrage League In 1888 Lake was involved in the foundation meeting of the South Australian Women's Suffrage League and was appointed to the council. Lake believed gender equality was \\"the original design of the Creator\\" and combined her passion for women's suffrage with her evangelical passion. Lake shared platforms with suffragists such as Mary Lee, and used logic, wit and evangelical fervour to argue in favour of women's suffrage. Lake was a strong believer in the evils of alcohol and felt confident that once women had the vote it would help to end the liquor trade. Woman's Christian Temperance Union In 1889 Lake was appointed to the position of Colonial Organiser of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of South Australia as well as Suffrage superintendent of the Union. Lake travelled widely across South Australia, as well as to Broken Hill, to enrol new members and establish branches of the Union throughout country South Australia. She was, with Elizabeth Webb Nicholls (1850–1943), Maria Peacock Henderson, Mary Jane George, Hannah Chewings, and Sarah Lindsay Evans a trustee of the Union when it was incorporated in 1891. She also spread the women's suffrage message through the Union in her role as Suffrage superintendent. In an 1890 report to the Union, Lake recorded 27 new Unions she had organised across South Australia. Lake requested each of the 65 South Australian Unions to report on the works of their women's suffrage departments, however, in her 1891 report she noted that only half replied and some did not have suffrage departments. The 1891 report provided information on the progress of women's suffrage legislation and contained an appeal from Lake to members to spread the suffrage work. A quote from Lake's 1891 report states: \\"The aim of our work is to wake both men and women up to the injustice and absurdity of a national life in which the mother influence has no acknowledged authority or legal recognition.\\". In 1891 Lake was made a life vice-president of the Union and stepped down from her other roles in the Union. Later life In the last ten years of her life, Lake devoted herself to evangelical and humanitarian causes. Lake was involved in the establishment of the Bible Christian Woman's Missionary Board to support missionary work in China and in 1892 she became the superintendent of evangelists. Lake died in Adelaide, South Australia, on 9 July 1902 and is buried in Payneham Cemetery. Octavius survived her by 20 years, and was an important figure in the unified Methodist Church in South Australia. A cousin, John Thorne (17 April 1838 – 22 August 1914), served the church in the northern areas of South Australia, arriving in 1873.

It was first activated in 1812. The regiment was consolidated with the 1st Regiment of Light Dragoons on May 12, 1814, forming the Regiment of Light Dragoons. Background An act of Congress on January 11, 1812 authorized an additional regiment of light Dragoons.Heitman pp. 80 By June 1812, the regiment had been activated.Rauch p. 8 Organization Although the regiment was organized on January 11, 1812 the regimental colonel, James Burn, was not appointed until April 25. Secretary of War William Eustis delayed recruiting for almost a month, then allowed recruitment of only three out of twelve companies. No clothing or equipment was supplied until September and October. The regiment was not fully equipped until December. Purchase of horses had been ordered in March but by September only half the regiment was mounted; many of its mounts were unfit for service. Eustis scattered the regiment from the Ohio River to New England. One company disappeared from the War Department's records.Elting p. 14 While stationed at Sackett's Harbor, New York, both the 1st and 2nd Regiments had their strength increased by the transfer of soldiers from the 26th Infantry Regiment.Brenner Service Neither the 1st Regiment nor the 2nd Regiment were used as consolidated units during the War of 1812. Generals frequently used their assigned dragoons as escorts, couriers and scouts rather than fighting men.Unwin p. 49 William Henry Harrison ordered Colonel John B. Campbell of the 19th Infantry to lead a force which included Major James Ball's squadron (including Captain Samuel Hopkins's troop) of the 2nd Regiment of Light Dragoons from Fort Greenville, Ohio to attack a cluster of Miami Indian villages on the Mississinewa River. On December 17, 1812, Campbell's force attacked and destroyed the principle village. The Miami counterattacked before dawn on December 18 and, although Campbell and his soldiers persevered, they suffered ten dead and thirty-eight wounded. Campbell retreated to Fort Greenville. The expedition suffered the loss of over one hundred horses and more than three hundred men were disabled by frostbite. More than one hundred dragoons were temporary or permanent but non-fatal, casualties. On April 28, 1813, General Procter and Tecumseh attempted to lure U.S. troops, including Major Ball's re-constituted 2nd Squadron into a battle outside Fort Meigs, Ohio. The U.S. forces held their ground inside the fort and the British and Indians broke off he attack.Urwin pp. 42—45Rauch p. 31 The regiment participated in the attack on Fort George, Upper Canada in May 1813. On September 27, 1813, Ball and his dragoons, although dismounted, accompanied Harrison on his invasion of Canada at Amherstburg. The squadron captured a bridge over the Aux Canards River.

Player profile Coming straight from the MICAA, Saldaña was signed to a rookie contract by Toyota in 1982. He would have become the PBA Rookie of the Year awardee in 1982 had he not figured in a brawl against the visiting South Korean national team (led by Lee Chung-hee) in the 1982 PBA Invitationals. Although he was leading the rookie stats race, he was disqualified and his namesake (but not related), Marte Saldaña of San Miguel, won the honor instead. Back then, he was said to have been the youngest player to join the PBA at 17 years old. However, after closer scrutiny, it turned out that Saldana was at least 4 years older than his claimed age. Saldaña was known for his blue-collar work on the hardcourt, defending the opposing team's best player, collaring rebounds on both ends, diving for loose balls, setting up bone-crunching picks to free his teammates and even acting as the team enforcer. He was also a very capable scorer, with an accurate perimeter jumper and excellent pivot moves. Early in his career, he was known as the \\"Plastic Man\\" for his twisting hang-time shots inside the paint. In his first year with the Gilbey's Gin team in 1983, Saldaña easily emerged as the team's top local performer, leading his team in scoring and rebounding, thus, becoming the very first Most Improved Player Awardee in the PBA. In 1987, Saldaña suffered one of the most gruesome injuries in the PBA when he overextended and violently twisted his knee when he landed badly while trying to block a shot attempt by, ironically, his namesake Marte Saldańa, then of Hills Bros. Coffee. He, however, miraculously recovered from what many perceived as a career-ending injury and even went on to play for at least 16 seasons in the PBA as a power forward. He may have been a journeyman, having played for at least six different PBA teams but there’s no denying how coaches appreciated his game. In his late 30s, he remained a key player for Gordon’s Gin’s successful championship bid in the 1997 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals against Alaska. In 2000, he suited up for Red Bull when he was about 42 years old, one of the very few PBA players to play at age 40.

Early Life and Family  Colton was born in London, the eldest of three children of Samuel Cutting, bootmaker, and his wife Hannah. In 1839 she emigrated with her widowed father, her brother Alfred and sister Hannah to Adelaide, South Australia aboard Orleana, arriving in June 1840. In 1844 Colton married (later Sir) John Colton saddler, hardware merchant and politician. Colton had nine children, several of whom died in infancy with her last child being born in 1865.  Philanthropy  Colton worked tirelessly for the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children. A committed Methodist, Mary began her philanthropy with the church's Dorcas Society, the South Adelaide Wesleyan Ladies' Working Society and the Nursing Sisters' Association. In the 1860s she served on the ladies' committee that managed the practical affairs of the Servant's Home, a facility for newly arrived female immigrants and servants awaiting employment. In 1867 she joined the ladies' committee of the Female Refuge, which sheltered single pregnant girls, reformed sex workers, deserted wives and victims of violence. In 1876 she was a founder of the Adelaide Children's Hospital and remained on the board of management for the rest of her life. Colton actively contributed to 22 causes in her public work as well as contributing to the lives of many in a private capacity including the Home for Incurables; the Maternity Relief Association; and the Strangers' Friend Society. In the 1880s and 1890s, as president of the Adelaide Female Reformatory, she visited women prisoners and assisted them on discharge.  Social Activism  In 1870 and in 1872 Colton joined deputations pressing the South Australian government to end institutional care and to introduce boarding-out for state children. After they succeeded in 1872, Colton worked on the Boarding-out Society's committee, then on the pioneering State Children's Council which was responsible for children cared for by licensed foster parents, in reformatories or in industrial schools. In 1883 she became treasurer and then president of the new ladies' division of the Social Purity Society, which successfully campaigned to have the age of consent raised from the age of 12. Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Colton worked with young women all her life and was particularly concerned for the welfare of girls with no family home. In 1884 she co-founded a club with a Christian focus for working girls which in December that year became a branch of the Young Women's Christian Association. Colton remained president of the YWCA for the remainder of her life opening city residential premises and suburban branches and successfully extending religious meetings, clubs and classes to supplement work of the churches.  Women's Suffrage League  In May 1892 Colton succeeded Edward Stirling as the President of the Women's Suffrage League where she guided it 'through all difficulties and discouragements'. The magnitude of her efforts for others had made her widely known and respected and this undoubtedly influenced some opinion to support the women's suffrage platform. Colton was applauded warmly when the league met to dissolve itself after the suffrage legislation was gazetted in March 1895. Later life After her husband was knighted in 1891, she became Lady Mary Colton. She died at her home on 30 July 1898 and is buried in West Terrace cemetery, and was survived by her husband, one daughter and four of her sons. The Colton Ward at the Women's and Children's Hospital and Lady Colton Hall in the 1900 YWCA building on Hindmarsh Square were named in her honour.

He is the co-founder of CareNex Health Services (now part of Anthem, Champion Health Enterprises, and Plymouth Health, the latter of which previously owned Alvarado Hospital in San Diego. He has served on numerous boards and is the youngest president in the history of the Los Angeles County Medical Association, a title he has held since 2014. Salimpour is also the first two-time recipient of the American College of Physicians' Research Award. As a keynote speaker he delivered the commencement address to the University of California, Riverside's 2008 graduating class, and gave the keynote address at the 2012 annual colloquium for the Whitehead Institute at MIT in 2012. Early life and education Dr Pedram Salimpour keynote speaker at 2008 commencement exercises, University of California, Riverside. Salimpour was born and raised in Tehran, Iran during the Iranian Revolution in the late 1970s. At the age of 10, he was forced to stop playing the piano due to the ban on Western music implemented by radical clerics who were put in place during the revolution. He immigrated along with his family to the United States, six months after his older brother Pejman Salimpour had immigrated to the U.S. Salimpour moved to Los Angeles at age 12 where his father eventually opened his own medical practice after working for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He mastered the English language from watching cartoons in English. During his early childhood in Iran, he had previously watched the same cartoons that were dubbed into Persian. He stated that he was able to make the association between the languages after watching the same cartoons again in English. He spoke fluent English without an accent by the time he began junior high school in Woodland Hills in 1981. Salimpour attended the University of California, Riverside upon graduating from high school. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from the school in 1990. He went on to attend UCLA where he earned his Master's Degree in Public Health, Health Services Administration in 1992. Salimpour attended Boston University School of Medicine where he earned a medical degree in 2000. During his time at Boston University, he authored a widely publicized research project that studied the tie between erectile dysfunction to frequent bicycle riding. His study was attributed as the first scientific proof that there is a significantly higher chance of being impotent if you are a cyclist. He was also a principle in the research that led to the introduction of Viagra, later creating the first department of sexual medicine in the United States. He completed his residency at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California Medical Center. He returned to the University of California, Riverside as a keynote speaker, giving the commencement address to the school's 2008 graduating class. Career Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Dr Pedram Salimpour. Salimpour's early career as a physician is linked to the Salimpour Pediatric Medical Group, a pediatric center operated by his father Ralph Salimpour in the greater Los Angeles area. As an entrepreneur, he is the co-founder of three medical companies, one of which previously owned one of San Diego's largest hospitals. He is the co-founder of CareNex Health Services, a health-care technology company that specializes in neonatal and perinatal disease management. The company was founded in 2005 along with his brother Pejman and was acquired by WellPoint (now Anthem) in 2013. The brothers also founded the physician-owned company Plymouth Health, formed for the purpose of acquiring Alvarado Hospital in San Diego. The previous owner of the hospital, Tenet Healthcare Corporation, was accused of paying kickbacks to physicians for referrals to the hospital. As part of a settlement from a civil complaint filed against them, Tenet agreed to sell the hospital and pay a settlement of $21 million. Salimpour and his brother paid approximately $36.5 million for the hospital and invested millions of dollars to upgrade the hospital's equipment and bring in some of the nation's top physicians prior to selling the hospital to Prime Healthcare in 2010. Dr. Pedram Salimpour (left) and brother Dr. Pejman Salimpour (right) with former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. After the sale of Alvarado, Salimpour co-founded Champion Health Enterprises, a company that specializes in health ecosystems for Native American tribes and business entities with greater than $500 million in annual revenue. He serves as the company's CEO and has partnered with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians since the inception of Champion Health. Salimpour's career in medicine has led him to the role of a writer, filmmaker, and professor. He has written more than 40 medical journal articles. In addition to his contributions in various medical journals, he wrote Photographic Atlas of Pediatric Disorders and Diagnosis, a book that he co-authored with his brother Pejman and his father Ralph Salimpour. He also received a Los Angeles area Emmy Award for his 2006 news documentary The Face of America.

By 2014 Census estimates, the New York City-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area was home to 262,375 Filipino Americans, 221,612 (84.5%) of them uniracial Filipinos. History New York City has a shorter settlement history compared to historically more common locations for Filipinos to immigrate to, such as the West Coast. =Early demographics= While larger populations Filipinos immigrated to New York City after 1965, many Filipinos began arriving in New York in the early 1900s. Many came to study as pensionados (or sponsored students) in universities like Columbia University and New York University. Like other immigrants at the time, these Filipinos entered through Ellis Island; Manuel Quezon and Carlos Romulo are among the small group of Filipinos who arrived in this way. In 1911, some Filipinos worked at the Dreamland Amusement Park in Coney Island, where they simulated what \\"savage\\" life was like in the Philippines. Most other Filipinos in New York at this time were seamen who docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yards. A Filipino restaurant called Manila Restaurant opened in the late 1920s and was located at 47 Sand Street in Brooklyn. In 1927, one of the first Filipino civic organizations in New York City, the Filipino Women's Club, was founded. In 1960, there were only 2,744 Filipino Americans in New York City. In 1970, there were 14,279 Filipinos in New York State, 52.4% of whom were college graduates. Filipinos in the New York City metropolitan area also did not enjoy the early advantage of their counterparts on the West Coast of the United States in terms of perceived geographic proximity to the Philippines by marine and air routes. Also in the 1990s, Philippine Airlines, which had provided service to Newark Liberty International Airport, discontinued this service due to financial difficulties. However, the determined Filipino American communities of the New York City metropolitan region ultimately overcame these obstacles in conjunction with the sheer number of opportunities provided by the region for Filipinos to work and thrive as a highly achieving, ambitious, and rapidly growing presence, first within the New York City region's Asian American milieu and eventually amidst its mainstream population. Filipino Americans started working in the traditional nursing and healthcare fields in the region's numerous hospitals and clinics,From Philippines, With Scrubs; How One Ethnic Group Came to Dominate the Nursing Field, The New York Times, November 24, 2003 before branching out to other professional fields. In the East Village and the Lower East Side, Manhattan, there was significant Filipino migration in the late 1980s due to mass recruitment of Filipino medical professionals to area hospitals, notably New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, Beth Israel Medical Center, and the former Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center. Migration was spurred by the hospitals' offer of subsidized housing to employees, in the midst of ongoing rent strikes in the neighborhood. The burgeoning Little Manila centered on 1st Avenue and 14th Street, around which there were, at the peak, a number of grocery/video rental stores and Filipino restaurants within a few blocks of one another. Filipino American community relations were strengthened by local Roman Catholic churches in the East Village and Gramercy Park areas. As rents increased, and properties were taken over by New York University, the number of Filipinos and Filipino businesses in the East Village's Little Manila waned. Elvie's Turo-Turo, the longest standing Filipino business in the area, closed in late 2009 after almost 20 years of operation.

It is the first fully paperless digital investment advice platform in Australia and provides consumers with access to professional investment services for less than the typical cost of a traditional financial adviser or wealth manager. History Stockspot was founded in 2013 by Chris Brycki, a former portfolio manager at UBS. He created Stockspot to provide an alternative for consumers in Australia who were being priced out of getting professional investment advice due to high fees, as well as receiving compromised advice. The business follows robo-advisor models similar to Wealthfront and Betterment in the US and Nutmeg in the UK where it provides automated investment advice and portfolio management. The beta version of its website was launched in September 2013. In April 2014, Stockspot secured A$250,000 of seed funding from AWI ventures to support its growth strategy. It was selected to represent Australia at the SWIFT Innotribe Startup Challenge in Singapore in May 2014 and recognised as one of Asia’s top 10 most innovative early stage financial technology companies from over 280 entries. At the Singapore event, it was chosen as one of the winners from Asia to advance to the Grand Finale at Sibos in Boston in October 2014. Stockspot was also runner-up in the 2014 Sydstart Startup Pitch Competition and named the top 25 hottest financial services startups from around the globe by Informilo. Stockspot completed a second Series A round of venture capital financing in June 2015 adding Rocket Internet and H2 Ventures onto its register. It was named in the global FinTech100 report by KPMG in December 2015. It completed another round of capital financing (Series B) in May 2017, led by Exchange- traded fund pioneer and ETF Securities founder Graham Tuckwell and Alium Capital. Products and services Stockspot’s platform provides both financial advice and investment management to its customers. Based on an online questionnaire, it uses software and algorithms to determine the customer’s risk profile and goals. It recommends an investment strategy and the platform then monitors and rebalances the portfolio for the customer. Money is invested in low-fee Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) across multiple asset classes including Australian Shares, Global Shares, Emerging Markets Shares, Fixed Income and Gold. It also provides the ability for its customers to personalise their portfolios with various investment themes. A strategic asset allocation strategy is used to optimise portfolio returns, and reduce volatility by asset class or geography. Its investment philosophy is that investing in index-based ETFs provides better after-fee returns compared to actively managed portfolios in developed markets like Australia. Controversy In December 2016, Stockspot accidentally released the financial and personal details of customers. According to the ABC report, Stockspot was unaware of the breach until they were contacted by the affected customer. CEO Chris Brycki confirmed that this was a one-off incident that affected a single client account and there was no financial risk to the client impacted.

It was built in c.1900. It is also known as Richard Randall's Studio. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Richard Randall Art Studio was purpose-built in 1900 as a two-storey timber studio and residence for Queensland artist Richard John Randall. While located at its original address at 72 Cordelia Street, South Brisbane, it served as the artist's residence, art studio, classroom and gallery for the last 6 years of his life, before his untimely death in 1906 at the age of 37. Subsequently, used as a residence, the upper floor of the studio was saved from demolition in 1988 when it was purchased by the Brisbane City Council and moved to a site in Musgrave Park. In 2007 the studio was relocated for a second time to its current location within the grounds of Brisbane Botanic Gardens at Toowong. Richard John Randall was born in Brisbane in 1869, the first son of George and Naomi Randall, former domestic servants who had recently emigrated from England to Brisbane. Growing up in South Brisbane, where his parents owned an increasingly successful retail business, Richard and his younger brother George (born in 1871) were both educated at the Brisbane Normal School. Richard went on to attend art classes at the Brisbane Technical College, which had been formed in 1882, operating under the control of the Brisbane School of Arts. While studying there he won awards for drawing and modelling. Watercolours and drawings by Richard were also included in the fine arts section of Queensland National Association exhibitions in the late 1880s. Queensland's art scene was still in its infancy in the late 19th century. The first art society was formed in 1887, the primary aims of which were to promote the fine arts and to establish annual exhibitions in Brisbane at a time when artists had almost no venues for exhibiting and selling their works. The Society was also seen as an important step towards forming a gallery for Queensland, such as had already been established in Sydney and Melbourne. The first exhibition held by the Society took place in the Masonic Hall in Alice Street, Brisbane, on 14 August 1888. In 1881 Richard's father George Randall was appointed Queensland Emigration Agent to Britain, a position that required him to take extended tours to England. There, he would travel around the various counties encouraging emigration to Queensland, engaging particularly with agricultural labourers. Between 1881 and 1902, George Randall travelled to England 4 times in the position of Emigration Agent, his longest trip lasting 5 years. In the meantime, the profits from the Randall family's South Brisbane business allowed the family to invest extensively in real estate and establish a large farming property at Birkdale, known as Somersby Grange. In April 1891, at the age of 22, Richard departed Brisbane with his mother and brother to accompany George Randall on his third tour to England. While there, Richard furthered his art studies and applied to enter a well known art school run by Professor Hubert von Herkomer at Bushey, Hertfordshire. In December 1892 he was accepted into the Herkomer School and spent the next few years there, eventually earning a free scholarship and life membership. In 1895 Richard Randall attained his highest commendation, when one of his watercolour paintings, entitled \\"The Old Mill\\", was accepted and exhibited by the Royal Academy of Arts. After leaving the Herkomer School, Richard Randall spent 18 months working in London, occupying a studio in Queensborough Terrace, Bayswater. During his time there he painted portraits of many eminent gentlemen, as well as making excursions to picturesque spots around England and to Paris. In 1899 Richard Randall returned to Queensland, the purpose of which (according to some sources) was \\"to carry out his father's patriotic wish, that now he had received some training and experience he should go back and use this and his talent to help lift art matters in his native city and country\\". Richard continued to pursue his career as an artist in Brisbane, becoming involved in exhibitions and competitions. In November 1899 he exhibited 50 of his water-colours for sale in Messrs Isles, Love and Co.'s auction mart, in relation to which he was described as a \\"daring colourist\\". The influence of Randall's style upon other artists was soon observed in local exhibitions. Richard Randall set about establishing his own residence and studio in Brisbane soon after his return. The site chosen was a block of land owned by his father at 72 Cordelia Street in South Brisbane, opposite St Andrew's Church of England. Purchased in May 1884, a residence (known as 'Hatfield') was built on the site and early photographs show this residence and the later studio standing close together on the site. Some sources state that the studio was built for Richard Randall by his father, however as George Randall was in England at the time of its construction in 1900, the level of his involvement in the project (beyond providing the land) is unclear. A 1914 account of Richard Randall's life states that Richard personally superintended the erection of the studio. As a purpose-built studio, rather than an adaptation of an existing building, it is likely that the building's design was based upon the type of artists' studios constructed in parts of London in the late 19th and early 20th century. Favouring the Queen Anne Revival style, these artists' studios were either part of or attached to a single house, or constructed as groups of units. In studio houses, the domestic function of the house was separate from and secondary to its studio use, with the studio itself usually located on the upper floor. Common features of artists' studios included a substantially sized painting room (that served as both a working and entertaining space), and large windows and skylights for adequate natural light, controlled by blinds. In particular, a window joined to an inclined skylight was very popular as it provided both top and side light. Careful consideration was also given to circulation, with an entrance located close to the painting room so that models and visitors would not have to pass through other areas of the house. Purpose-built artists' studios, whether grand or modest, were a reflection of the improved social and professional status of artists working in London in the late Victorian period. While modest in size and incorporating local materials and construction techniques, the Randall studio's design reflects many of the aspects of a typical London artist's studio, which Richard Randall would have been familiar with, having lived and worked there for some time. Its style, described in a Brisbane newspaper article as resembling a \\"Swiss chalet\\", incorporates characteristics of Australian \\"Queen Anne\\" style, such as an asymmetrical facade, steeply pitched Marseilles tile-clad roof, terracotta roof apex ornaments, a street-facing gable, and projecting bay window with multi-paned top lights. Built on steeply sloping ground, the studio occupied the upper floor at street level and the residence below was accessed by an external staircase at the rear. The residential level consisted of at least four rooms connected by a side verandah, however its exact layout is unknown. The studio itself was a single volume lit by a large bay window and skylight in the centre of the main elevation, with blinds to control light levels. A part-height timber partition wall created an entrance passageway, with a curtain hung across it to shield views into the studio from the front door. The high walls (painted a \\"cool green\\") had few windows, providing ample hanging space for pictures, and the room contained a \\"model's throne\\". A contemporary description called it \\"a fine commodious studio (said to be one of the best-equipped private studios in Australia)\\". Richard Randall's studio was not the first artist's studio to be constructed in Queensland, however free-standing, purpose-built studio buildings remained rare, constructed only by those able to afford it. Of the many practicing artists and photographers working in Brisbane at the time, most operated from existing commercial premises. One known exception was the English-born artist Godfrey Rivers, appointed second art master at the Brisbane Technical College in 1890, who built a wooden studio building in the grounds of the Brisbane School of Arts in 1891 to a design by George Henry Male Addison. His studio was described as \\"a wooden building of one room, lofty, sufficiently spacious, and admirably lighted by a single fine south window\\" (building no longer extant). Once settled into his new studio residence, Richard Randall began advertising for pupils in the Brisbane Courier, offering drawing and painting lessons in a variety of mediums, including oils, water-colours and pastels. On Wednesday afternoons he was \\"at home\\" to visitors, providing an opportunity for socialising and displaying his latest works. Richard worked, exhibited and taught at the studio, establishing a reputation as a popular and successful Brisbane artist and teacher, and providing a focus for a coterie of local artists influenced by the Randall style. When he was not teaching, Richard travelled around south-east Queensland in search of new subjects and scenes to paint. He also took an active role in many artistic clubs and societies, including the Brisbane Sketching Club and the Queensland Art Society, of which he was vice-president from December 1903. A breakaway art society, calling itself the New Society of Artists, formed in 1904, as a result of dissatisfaction with some policies of the more elite Queensland Art Society. In August 1906, the engagement of Richard Randall to Miss Minna Wirth, daughter of one of the founders of the Queensland Art Society, artist Lewis Wirth, was announced in a local paper. Some time after his return to Australia, Richard received overtures from various London art galleries, and subsequently collections of his works were sent back to England and displayed for purchase. His watercolours and paintings of Australian landscapes and scenery were particularly admired, as they conveyed \\"a more pleasing and favourable impression of the Australian bush and scenery than had hitherto been entertained\\". Tragedy struck in October 1906 when Richard Randall died unexpectedly, of what is believed to have been a brain tumour, at Somersby Grange, aged 37. The funeral held on 16 October was well attended by members of Brisbane's artistic circles, including representatives of the Queensland Art Society and the New Society of Artists, who, in a rare moment of unity between the two groups, acted as pall bearers. Richard's death came as a great shock to his father, who spent much of his time after 1906 promoting the life and works of his son. In 1907 he compiled and published an elaborate memorial brochure, featuring photographs of Richard, his studio and some of his paintings. The studio and its contents were kept intact until , and opened for viewing by the public and eminent guests, such as Govennor and Lady Chelmsford, who visited in December 1906 and purchased several watercolour sketches. In 1909 the South Brisbane City Council was persuaded to accept 600 of Richard's works in perpetual trust. A quarter-acre of vacant land adjoining the studio was offered by George Randall as a location for a gallery to house the collection, however it was eventually housed on the upper floor of the South Brisbane Library, which had been converted from a library space into the Randall Art Gallery. The Randall Collection contained everything from early and incomplete works and sketches to his most prized paintings. After 1922 the collection was added to by George Randall upon his return from a visit to England, where he had purchased a number of his son's paintings from a London art gallery. Memorial bust of Richard Randall, 1925 In 1925, sculptor Charles Lowther was commissioned to make a memorial bust of Randall. The bust was unveiled on 19 June 1925 by the Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan at Randall's studio. When the City Council of Greater Brisbane was formed in 1925 it took over the assets of the South Brisbane Council, including the Randall Collection, which was moved to Brisbane City Hall. Some paintings were hung in reception rooms, while the majority were displayed in a large, well-lit room on the fifth floor. The collection's continuous occupation of the foremost gallery space in Brisbane caused friction between the Council, representatives of the Randall family and the Royal Queensland Art Society, who requested to use the gallery for other purposes. In 1943, after being closed for a year due to lack of staff, the collection was removed from the gallery and stored in the City Hall basement. After the end of World War II, the collection was not reinstated to the gallery and the majority of works remained in poor storage conditions in the basement, or were loaned out or taken without any record being kept of where they went. A 1953 newspaper article claimed that the paintings were being eaten by rats and falling into disrepair; however it was not until the mid-1980s that a concerted effort was made to track down and restore the collection, which had dwindled to 154 pieces. In 2013 the Richard Randall collection remains part of the Brisbane City Council owned Museum of Brisbane art collection. Members of the Randall family retained ownership of the Cordelia Street property until 1981. From late 1913 the studio was rented out as a residence, and at some point the upper floor was partitioned. In a 1926 sewerage plan the studio is named \\"Brindisi\\" and is fenced off from two other residences on the property. In 1987, Richard Randall's Studio was listed by the National Trust of Queensland, who described it as \\"a unique example of a purpose-built artist's studio and reception rooms\\". In 1988 the building was threatened with demolition due to redevelopment of the site; however it was purchased in time by Brisbane City Council in recognition of its historical significance. Only the upper floor (the former studio) was saved and relocated approximately along Cordelia Street to Musgrave Park, while the remainder of the building was demolished. In 1989 the studio was stumped and re-orientated to a north-west aspect to face an avenue through the park. Internal partitions and a lowered ceiling were removed and the building was repaired and renovated, with facilities such as a small kitchenette installed in a rear corner. In front of the studio a timber picket fence, similar to one which had existed at the original location, was constructed. The studio was officially opened by the Lord Mayor Sallyanne Atkinson, in December 1990 as the Richard Randall Studio, part of the Jagera Arts Centre in Musgrave Park. The Richard Randall Artist's Studio Award, established by the Council the same year, provided rent-free use of the building to selected local artists for set periods as a studio and gallery. Artists were chosen by a panel of professional arts community representatives, and were required to produce a quota of artwork for public use during their residency. By the mid-2000s the studio was in need of repairs and had become vulnerable to damage by vandals. In 2007 it was relocated for the second time by Brisbane City Council to its present site in the Mt Coot-tha Botanic Gardens, adjacent to the main visitor's car park. Officially opened on 6 October 2008 by the Lady Mayoress Mrs Lisa Newman, in the presence of descendants of the Randall family, the renovated studio is used as a function and exhibition venue available to the public and community groups for hire.  Description  The Richard Randall Art Studio is a small, single-storey, timber-framed building located within the grounds of Brisbane Botanic Gardens Mt Cooth-tha in Toowong. Set against a backdrop of mature trees and bamboo, the building is adjacent to and clearly visible from the car park in the northern area of the Gardens. High-set on timber and steel stumps over sloping ground, the building is orientated to face south-west and sited to accommodate a level timber and steel walkway from the car park to the front door on the left-hand side of the main elevation. A timber picket fence and gate, constructed in the style of the fence at the studio's original location, stands at the edge of the footpath, with a garden bed behind. Trees and grassed lawns surround the remainder of the building. Measuring approximately , the studio building is rectangular in plan with a narrow frontage and a small verandah at the rear. The steeply-pitched roof is clad in red Marseilles tiles with terracotta finials and metal acroteria, and has timber lined eaves, wide. The front section of the roof has a half gable, while the rear is hipped, extending over the rear verandah. Centrally located immediately below the front half gable is a large rectangular inclined skylight supported by timber mullions, the bottom of which meets the top of a projecting bay window. This tripartite window consists of a central sash window with casements on either side. The upper portion of all 3 windows is multi-paned, while the lower portions have a single pane. Both the skylight and the bay window have modern roller blind systems attached to the outside. The studio has only two other small windows, one on each side elevation. These are timber, double-hung sashes with multi-pane upper lights and a single pane lower light, one on the north-west wall next to the main entry and one on the south-east wall near the rear corner. The front elevation is clad in timber chamferboards, and the sides with weatherboards. The rear verandah wall retains exposed timber studs, however the southern end has had a modern accessible bathroom inserted within the verandah space. This bathroom is clad with flat sheeting and the verandah?s two-rail dowel balustrade and stop- chamfered posts are retained. A small sunhood over the entrance is supported by curved timber brackets and clad in mini-orb sheeting, positioned higher than its original location. The low-waisted, 4-panel timber door features some early door hardware, including a central door knob and a door knocker, and has glazed upper panels. Two short posts with ornamental tops incorporated into the door's architrave are the remnants of the original front stair balustrade. The interior of the studio is a single large room, well-lit by the large bay window and inclined skylight. An entrance hall area is formed by a timber partition wall that extends into the room, topped by wide timber boards that act as shelves, partly supported by a small turned timber column. The high ceiling is coved, with the tie beams of the roof framing exposed through the space. These beams are stop-chamfered and the end beams braced in each corner. The ceiling and walls are lined with timber, v-jointed tongue and groove boards, and the floor with polished timber boards. Fittings and fixtures within the space include a contemporary aluminium rail for picture hanging, reproduction suspended and wall light fittings, switches and power outlets, and strip lighting fitted discreetly to the upper side of the tie beams. A small kitchenette and fridge are located in the south-eastern corner. The door to the rear verandah is a contemporary 4 panel timber door, located at the northern end of the north-east wall. The verandah floor is lined with linoleum and the raked ceiling is clad in timber v-jointed boards. The underfloor area of the studio is used as storage space and is enclosed with vertical timber battens.  Heritage listing  Richard Randall Art Studio was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Richard Randall Art Studio (1900) is important in demonstrating the evolution and growth of artistic culture in Queensland in the late 19th and early 20th century. Constructed for an aspiring young Queensland artist who had studied and worked in England, the studio is representative of the confidence felt by members of Brisbane's artistic elite in the future of Queensland as a place of culture and artistic inspiration. The studio building has served as an important venue for the education and professional development of both artists and art students in Queensland, initially under the tutelage of the studio's first owner, Richard Randall, and since the late 1980s as a workshop and exhibition space available to the public. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As the surviving portion of Richard Randall's purpose-built studio and residence, the Richard Randall Art Studio is an example of a building type that is and always has been rare in Queensland. The building is the only known artist's studio of its type from the early 20th century remaining in Queensland, built in a period when most professional artists worked from existing commercial premises. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Richard Randall Art Studio demonstrates the principal characteristics of a purpose-built artist's studio, with a single large internal volume able to accommodate a variety of functions and arrangements of furniture and objects; large plain wall surfaces for displaying artworks; and strategically placed windows and skylight to provide southern light, controlled by blinds. Based upon the type of artist's studio that was common in London in the late 19th century, the studio's design is illustrative of the ideal working environment preferred by professional artists of the period. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Richard Randall Art Studio has a special association with the Queensland artist Richard John Randall. A popular and influential artist in his day, Richard Randall made an important contribution to the advancement of art and culture in Queensland through his artworks, teaching and his involvement with leading art societies and clubs. Designed especially for him, the studio was where he lived, worked, taught and exhibited his works for the last 6 years of his life, and where his works were displayed for a further 7 years after his death. The collection of his works, donated by the Randall family to the local authorities in perpetual trust, formed the foundation of the Brisbane City Council's art collection.

The main wave of immigrants came during the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s, in order to escape the violence and political and economic instability in the country. Since then, Salvadorans have continued to migrate to Los Angeles as well as other cities around the United States. The community is well established in Los Angeles and stands as an integral part of its cultural and economic life. Demographics Salvadoran population in the United States. Los Angeles has a higher population than El Salvador's capital amd largest city San Salvador In Los Angeles, the Salvadoran population has a slightly larger number of women than men, which is 52.6% women versus 47.4% men out of 255,218 Salvadorans in the area. Out of 67,842 Salvadoran households in Los Angeles, about 80% of them have more than one person living in the home. About 71% over the age of 16 are employed. Men and women have about equal employment rates. Most work in education or health care industries. Another 36% are employed in service- oriented jobs. About 23.8% of men are employed in construction or maintenance occupations while only about 1.5% of women work in these sectors. The median amount of income that Salvadorans earn per household is about $36,850 and about 30% of all families are at or below poverty level. Almost 50% of Salvadorans over 25 have not graduated high school and about 7% have graduated from college within 4 years or have a degree higher than a bachelor's degree. An estimated 95% speak Spanish at home and 53.5% speak English \\"less than well\\". Pico Union and the El Salvador Community Corridor, a part of Vermont Avenue, have the highest concentration of Salvadorans in Los Angeles. Culture =Language= Salvadoran Spanish and Central American Spanish is the second most spoken Spanish in Los Angeles. Salvadorans and other Central Americans are the largest Voseo speakers in the United States Most Salvadorans speak Spanish. Among the Los Angeles diaspora, 95% speak a language other than English at home. =Religion= About 57% of Salvadorans are Roman Catholic, and there are several Latino Catholic congregations in Los Angeles. However, Central American Catholicism is different than US Catholicism; recent immigrants feel that US Catholicism does not align with their practices and so many convert to Protestantism. Both Protestant and Catholic churches in Los Angeles play crucial roles in the diaspora community. During the civil war, churches were among the first to provide safe spaces for refugees and house them even when they did not have official US government status. They also provide services for youth to steer them away from gangs and drugs and towards education and community. =Family= Families in El Salvador are traditionally large and close-knit. Though men were traditionally the heads of households and the breadwinners, in the era of migration, women have increasingly become the heads as the men migrate to find work. Women also usually find work faster in Los Angeles, because of the high demand for low wage women workers in sectors such as the garment industry, the electronics industry, cleaning services, and personal aides for the elderly or children. This shift in gender roles can increase tension within families as they adjust to living in the US. Families are often separated when parents or those able to work migrate to the US and leave children in the care of their grandparents or older siblings. Some families are reunited, but may still have tense relationships between parents and their kids as kids may have felt abandoned or their parents have lost authority after they migrated. Children usually integrate into US culture faster than their parents, causing some additional tension between parents and children due to the differences in values and interests, especially those regarding discipline and connections to El Salvador. History and Reasons For Migration Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Belize are historically the seven nations in Central America politically, geographically and culturally. Salvadorans first started migrating to the United States after World War I following shipping lines that went to ports in Los Angeles. There they hoped to find jobs in coffee shipping and processing. Salvadoran Americans started emigrating from El Salvador in high numbers during the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s. About 20-30% of Salvadorans left the country and about half of them migrated to the U.S. the rate of emigration from El Salvador reached a peak of 46 persons per 1,000 population in 1981. The reasons for which Salvadorans have migrated to United States vary but most of the academic community and organizations such as the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants and American Civil Liberties Union believe that migration trends are mostly derived from \\"direct fear of political violence and persecution.\\" According to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Salvador, which recorded many events, during the high instability of the early 1980s, there were many political killings, many of which were done by the government. Crops were also destroyed which worsen the already unstable economy and farmers who lived off their crops. With the amount of instability increasing in El Salvador, large numbers of internal migration occurred within the country that eventually resulted in the external migration of many people. The U.S government played a role in these situations. The U.S was supportive of the Salvadoran government during the civil war due to their mutual dislike of the leftist rebel group FMLN (Farabundo Mardi National Liberation Front). However, the U.S State and Justice departments argue that increased violence has only caused the economic hardship to worsen which then gives more people more reason to emigrate. The Reagan administration first refused to classify incoming Salvadoran immigrants as refugees because it believed that they were merely seeking economic prosperity. =Gangs and Deportation= The most prominent gangs in Los Angeles and El Salvador are MS-13 and 18th Street Gang. La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) was created as a form of security for the Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles against the other gangs in the area. The 18th Street gang is a Chicano gang that was developed around 1959, and it is a rival to La Mara Salvatrucha. These gangs have spread to several countries in Central America, like El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. The gang-related violence in Los Angeles has generally decreased from 2001 to 2009. Some of these gang members are undocumented, and when they are deported back to El Salvador, they often join the MS-13 or 18th Street cliques, or they return to the United States illegally. Although El Salvador is riddled with gang activity and crime, the United States does not consider Salvadoran immigrants to be refugees since peace was officially declared after the civil war in 1992 by the Chapultepec Peace Accords. A diaspora is a group of people who are united by ethnic or cultural ties. It is a branch of transnationalism, which is a group of ideas coming from outside different nations or countries. A diaspora “is not a discrete entity, but rather it is a combination of contradictory convergences of people, ideas, and their cultural considerations”. According to Danielle Renwick, tens of thousands of refugees from The Northern Triangle ( Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans) came to the U.S seeking asylum from their violence ridden countries, many of them with children. Those countries that belong to the Northern Triangle were in the midst of civil wars in the 1980s. Since their migration from the 1980s, MS 13 grew in power in the United States during the 1990s. At this time, towards the end of Clinton’s Presidency, the U.S. intervened to get these foreign individuals out of the country. To do so, foreign born residents that had varying criminal records were deported back to their homelands. The U.S. deportation policy were at an all time high, thereafter starting the trend of MS 13 influx to and from the U.S. and El Salvador. The strict deportation policies created to target MS 13 and other gangs like M 18, created a “Revolving Door migratory pattern.” (1) The migration of MS 13 from Central America to the U.S., and being deported from the U.S. back to Central America, created an ideology that was strengthened throughout that migratory pattern. This was possible because people who fled Central America were able to come together as a group and adapt to a new way of life in the U.S. This brought about their knowledge and involvement in extortion, kidnapping, turf protection, human trafficking, and illegal drug marketing. These ideas were brought back and forth through the “revolving doors,” and they consistently found ways to improve in these areas. This was the start of their diaspora and became a source of great concern. According to Paul Liquorie, “We have seen time and time again people who have been deported returning back to the United States because they are already networked into the criminal element that is running the human smuggling routes.” Foreign Policy and Domestic Policy Issues President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama greet children during the arrival ceremony at Comalapa International Airport in San Salvador, El Salvador, March 22, 2011. Salvadoran activism was strong during the Salvadoran Civil War (1980-1992) between the right-wing government and its paramilitary forces and the left- wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and its guerrilla fighters. The Salvadoran diaspora focused on lobbying the US government to stop supporting the Salvadoran government and to provide refugee status and temporary protected status (TPS) for Salvadorans fleeing the civil war. The US government was supporting the Salvadoran government with military aid because the US viewed it as an anti-communist force fighting the communist (FMLN). The US did withdraw support from the Salvadoran government after the Soviet Union collapsed and as the human rights violations of the Salvadoran government became more public. After the peace treaty was signed in 1992, the Salvadoran diaspora shifted its focus inward to domestic policy issues, especially those regarding immigration, status in the US, and workers rights. The Salvadoran diaspora concentrates legal services for those in the US on visas, without visas, those seeking citizenship, or those petitioning for family to come to the US . They advocate for extending TPS and help those with TPS renew their status. The diaspora is also engaged in pushing for immigration reform that, \\"that acknowledges the valuable contributions immigrants bring and that respects the basic human rights of all immigrants and allows them to live a life full of dignity and equal opportunity\\". Salvadorans are also closely following President Obama's plan Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) as many youth are facing deportation and loss of status. Community Groups in Los Angeles and Modes of Organizing  Pico-Union, Los Angeles became the first destination Salvadorans settled in when entering the city There are many Salvadoran and Central American organizations in Los Angeles. Primary among them are El Rescate, Central American Resource Center (CARECEN), Salvadoran American National Association, and the Salvadoran American Leadership and Education Fund (SALEF). There are more left-leaning Salvadorans, those that generally support the FMLN, than right-wing, conservative Salvadorans in Los Angeles and so the left-wing activists organizations are more organized in the community. El Rescate, founded in 1981, was the first Salvadoran organization founded in Los Angeles. CARECEN, founded in 1983, came next. Most of the Salvadoran organizations in Los Angeles engage in legal services, immigration reform, education, civic and voter engagement, and cultural events for the community. The diaspora organizes through these organizations to participate in elections and vote for Salvadoran candidates or those who support Central American issues. They also organize and participate in protests for immigration reform and human rights. Staffs from the organizations and members of the community also contact their representatives to fight for their issues. Organizations also organize events for Salvadoran holidays and to celebrate Salvadoran culture. These events bring the diaspora together in a cultural identity and love for the homeland. There is a large parade every year in Los Angeles for Salvadoran Independence Day on September 15. The major event for Salvadorans every year is Feria Agostina on August 6. El Rescate has organized a parade and festival for the event every year since 1996. The festival aims to bring together the Salvadoran community, businesses, and organizations to celebrate Salvadoran culture. There are games, prizes, Salvadoran food, and parades. There is also information about financial services, housing, health care, legal services, real estate and travel to El Salvador, and remittance services. Organizations also host trips to El Salvador to teach those in Los Angeles about Salvadoran culture and instill a love for the country. To serve the daily needs of the community, CARECEN provides educational spaces for adults and youth to help with school, engage creatively, and have safe spaces to meet with others. CARECEN also runs a day labor center to connect workers in Los Angeles with employers and help workers make sure they are paid fair wages. The day labor center also provides English language programs, computer literacy programs, and health programs. Connections to El Salvador The Salvadoran diaspora as a whole maintains strong connections to El Salvador. One of the main ways they do this is through remittances. 70% of Salvadorans in the US send remittances to friends and family in El Salvador. These remittances account for about 16% of the Salvadoran Gross Domestic Product and go to helping receivers pay for food, education, health care, clothes, and business, land, and real estate investments. The Salvadoran diaspora also maintains several thriving industries in order to connect with El Salvador. There is a strong tourism industry of migrants returning to visit their hometowns and family. There are courier services around Los Angeles that bring money and goods to El Salvador and bring back goods, news, and letters to the US. The diaspora also invests in real estate in El Salvador either for monetary investments, for their families in El Salvador, and/or for a place to move back to and retire. The diaspora wishes to keep track of Salvadoran news, so several major Salvadoran dailies, including El Diario de Hoy and La Prensa Gráfica, have started publishing US editions. La Prensa Gráfica additionally has a section on the website called Departmento 15 that is devoted to stories about Salvadorans living abroad and international news. The name is a play on geography; El Salvador is divided into 14 departments, so those outside the country make a 15th for the country. Salvadorans in Los Angeles engage not only socially and culturally but also politically. Salvadoran candidates may travel to the US to campaign in the hopes of raising funds and convincing Salvadorans outside El Salvador to tell their friends and family in El Salvador how to vote. After lobbying the Salvadoran government, starting in 2014 Salvadorans living abroad are able to vote in the presidential elections. Emigrants say they deserve this right because they support the country economically and so should have influence in the political processes.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1881 to 1902 by W Macfarlane. It is also known as South Brisbane School of Arts, South Brisbane Mechanics Institute, South Brisbane Technical College, and South Brisbane Post & Telegraph Office. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. It now houses the Griffith University Film School, which forms part of the Queensland College of Art.  History  This complex is composed of three structures built at different times in response to different needs: the South Brisbane Post Office (1881); the South Brisbane Municipal Library (1897); and the City Concert Hall (1902). The South Brisbane Post Office was designed by FDG Stanley and W Macfarlane was the contractor. The one-room post office occupied the ground floor. The postmaster's accommodation included three bedrooms and verandah upstairs and basement dining room, kitchen and bedroom. The original symmetrical front facade included a ground floor arcade with an open verandah above. The central focus was the arched masonry frontispiece. The Post and Telegraph Office was closed in late 1889 to become the South Brisbane Mechanics Institute and Library. In 1893 the South Brisbane Town Council took over the site. About 1897, the council with the help of a government subsidy built the corner structure and the complex became known as the South Brisbane Municipal Library and Technical College. John Henry Burley is said to be the architect. The third stage is the concert hall designed by Alexander Brown Wilson in 1902. This building included Technical College classrooms in the basement. In 1909 the council was offered the Richard John Randall collection of artwork. About the same time, with the Queensland Government take-over of the Technical College, many classrooms became vacant. The council decided to convert the library on the first floor into an art gallery. Architect George David Payne was employed to convert the former library to the Randall Art Gallery and extend the concert hall and supper room. About 1911 the hall was enlarged at the river end and the supper room extended so that they were capable of seating 600 and 400 persons respectively. The Gallery was officially opened in July 1914. Between 1910 and 1920 the post office section was rendered and the front enclosed. The Greater Brisbane City Council took over the structure in 1925 and the library continued to function until 1973. However, the Randall collection was transferred to the Brisbane City Hall. For many years the concert hall continued to be well patronised particularly during the Second World War (1939–45). Between 1973 and about 1987 the building was neglected and vandalised. The derelict library was refurbished for World Expo '88 as a convention centre and exclusive club. The exterior was painted and the interior was substantially altered to provide two large conference rooms and club rooms. The former Post Office section was converted to modern offices and concrete stairs installed. It now houses the Griffith University Film School, which forms part of the Queensland College of Art.  Description  View from Dock Street, 2015 The former South Brisbane Library is located within an historic precinct centred on South Brisbane Memorial Park. It is opposite the former South Brisbane Municipal Chambers (South Brisbane Town Hall) and adjacent to the former South Brisbane Railway Easement and South Brisbane Dry Dock (Queensland Maritime Museum). Other historically significant places in the immediate vicinity include Cumbooquepa (Somerville House) and Ship Inn. The former South Brisbane Library consists of three interlinking buildings. The two-storeyed former Post Office and Library both have Stanley Street frontages, similar gable roofs and string courses that delineate the two floors. The former City Concert Hall is a single-storeyed auditorium with a Dock Street frontage. Both the hall and corner building are polychromatic brick structures with matching arched windows. The first stage (1881) is a two-storeyed masonry building with basement. The hipped roof has a gablet and there was a frieze above the verandah roof. The front facade has multi-paned windows, a pair of faceted bays and raked verandah roof supported by large timber brackets. The 1890s section, on the corner, is an asymmetrical brick building. It has a gable roof, a gablet of similar proportions to the post office, and a tower on the southern corner. The World Expo '88 interior refurbishment included the carpeting and painting of the interior, a new staircase from the front foyer to the first floor and modern fretwork brackets. The third stage (1902), at the rear, is a long rectangular building with light coloured horizontal strings and window arches. The corrugated iron hipped roof has a continuous raised roof ventilator. The interior walls has timber panelled dados, plaster raked ceilings and an unadorned proscenium stage. French doors open onto a verandah. A gallery and new verandah were added as part of the Expo renovations.  Heritage listing  The former South Brisbane Library was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former South Brisbane Library is significant historically for its importance as the former Post and Telegraph Office, mechanic's institute, technical college, library, art gallery, and concert hall of South Brisbane, and remains a tangible reminder of civic identity. It is also significant as a marker of the former alignment of Stanley Street, the main commercial thoroughfare of South Brisbane in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Despite internal refurbishment, the former concert hall remains important in illustrating the principal characteristics of an early 20th century auditorium designed to address the warm Queensland climate. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building demonstrates a visual cohesiveness, despite having been constructed in several stages to the designs of at least three architects, and makes a significant landmark and aesthetic contribution to the historic precinct centred on South Brisbane Memorial Park. It is a significant component of the riverside townscape as seen from the city. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is an important example of the public work of Brisbane architect AB Wilson.

His art studio, the Richard Randall Art Studio, was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.  Early life Richard John Randall was born in Brisbane in 1869, the first son of George and Naomi Randall, former domestic servants who had recently emigrated from England to Brisbane. Growing up in South Brisbane, where his parents owned an increasingly successful retail business, Richard and his younger brother George (born in 1871) were both educated at the Brisbane Normal School. Richard went on to attend art classes at the Brisbane Technical College, which had been formed in 1882, operating under the control of the Brisbane School of Arts. While studying there he won awards for drawing and modelling. Watercolours and drawings by Richard were also included in the fine arts section of Queensland National Association exhibitions in the late 1880s. Queensland's art scene was still in its infancy in the late 19th century. The first art society was formed in 1887, the primary aims of which were to promote the fine arts and to establish annual exhibitions in Brisbane at a time when artists had almost no venues for exhibiting and selling their works. The Society was also seen as an important step towards forming a gallery for Queensland, such as had already been established in Sydney and Melbourne. The first exhibition held by the Society took place in the Masonic Hall in Alice Street, Brisbane, on 14 August 1888. In 1881 Richard's father George Randall was appointed Queensland Emigration Agent to Britain, a position that required him to take extended tours to England. There, he would travel around the various counties encouraging emigration to Queensland, engaging particularly with agricultural labourers. Between 1881 and 1902, George Randall travelled to England 4 times in the position of Emigration Agent, his longest trip lasting 5 years. In the meantime, the profits from the Randall family's South Brisbane business allowed the family to invest extensively in real estate and establish a large farming property at Birkdale, known as Somersby Grange. European career In April 1891, at the age of 22, Richard departed Brisbane with his mother and brother to accompany George Randall on his third tour to England. While there, Richard furthered his art studies and applied to enter a well known art school run by Professor Hubert von Herkomer at Bushey, Hertfordshire. In December 1892 he was accepted into the Herkomer School and spent the next few years there, eventually earning a free scholarship and life membership. In 1895 Richard Randall attained his highest commendation, when one of his watercolour paintings, entitled \\"The Old Mill\\", was accepted and exhibited by the Royal Academy of Arts. After leaving the Herkomer School, Richard Randall spent 18 months working in London, occupying a studio in Queensborough Terrace, Bayswater. During his time there he painted portraits of many eminent gentlemen, as well as making excursions to picturesque spots around England and to Paris. Queensland career In 1899 Richard Randall returned to Queensland, the purpose of which (according to some sources) was \\"to carry out his father's patriotic wish, that now he had received some training and experience he should go back and use this and his talent to help lift art matters in his native city and country\\". Richard continued to pursue his career as an artist in Brisbane, becoming involved in exhibitions and competitions. In November 1899 he exhibited 50 of his water-colours for sale in Messrs Isles, Love and Co.'s auction mart, in relation to which he was described as a \\"daring colourist\\". The influence of Randall's style upon other artists was soon observed in local exhibitions. Richard Randall set about establishing his own residence and studio in Brisbane soon after his return. The site chosen was a block of land owned by his father at 72 Cordelia Street in South Brisbane, opposite St Andrew's Church of England. Purchased in May 1884, a residence (known as 'Hatfield') was built on the site and early photographs show this residence and the later studio standing close together on the site. Some sources state that the studio was built for Richard Randall by his father, however as George Randall was in England at the time of its construction in 1900, the level of his involvement in the project (beyond providing the land) is unclear. A 1914 account of Richard Randall's life states that Richard personally superintended the erection of the studio. As a purpose-built studio, rather than an adaptation of an existing building, it is likely that the building's design was based upon the type of artists' studios constructed in parts of London in the late 19th and early 20th century. Favouring the Queen Anne Revival style, these artists' studios were either part of or attached to a single house, or constructed as groups of units. In studio houses, the domestic function of the house was separate from and secondary to its studio use, with the studio itself usually located on the upper floor. Common features of artists' studios included a substantially sized painting room (that served as both a working and entertaining space), and large windows and skylights for adequate natural light, controlled by blinds. In particular, a window joined to an inclined skylight was very popular as it provided both top and side light. Careful consideration was also given to circulation, with an entrance located close to the painting room so that models and visitors would not have to pass through other areas of the house. Purpose-built artists' studios, whether grand or modest, were a reflection of the improved social and professional status of artists working in London in the late Victorian period. While modest in size and incorporating local materials and construction techniques, the Richard Randall Art Studio's design reflects many of the aspects of a typical London artist's studio, which Richard Randall would have been familiar with, having lived and worked there for some time. Its style, described in a Brisbane newspaper article as resembling a \\"Swiss chalet\\", incorporates characteristics of Australian \\"Queen Anne\\" style, such as an asymmetrical facade, steeply pitched Marseilles tile- clad roof, terracotta roof apex ornaments, a street-facing gable, and projecting bay window with multi-paned top lights. Built on steeply sloping ground, the studio occupied the upper floor at street level and the residence below was accessed by an external staircase at the rear. The residential level consisted of at least four rooms connected by a side verandah, however its exact layout is unknown. The studio itself was a single volume lit by a large bay window and skylight in the centre of the main elevation, with blinds to control light levels. A part-height timber partition wall created an entrance passageway, with a curtain hung across it to shield views into the studio from the front door. The high walls (painted a \\"cool green\\") had few windows, providing ample hanging space for pictures, and the room contained a \\"model's throne\\". A contemporary description called it \\"a fine commodious studio (said to be one of the best-equipped private studios in Australia)\\". Once settled into his new studio residence, Richard Randall began advertising for pupils in the Brisbane Courier, offering drawing and painting lessons in a variety of mediums, including oils, water-colours and pastels. On Wednesday afternoons he was \\"at home\\" to visitors, providing an opportunity for socialising and displaying his latest works. Richard worked, exhibited and taught at the studio, establishing a reputation as a popular and successful Brisbane artist and teacher, and providing a focus for a coterie of local artists influenced by the Randall style. When he was not teaching, Richard travelled around south-east Queensland in search of new subjects and scenes to paint. He also took an active role in many artistic clubs and societies, including the Brisbane Sketching Club and the Queensland Art Society, of which he was vice- president from December 1903. A breakaway art society, calling itself the New Society of Artists, formed in 1904, as a result of dissatisfaction with some policies of the more elite Queensland Art Society. In August 1906, the engagement of Richard Randall to Miss Minna Wirth, daughter of one of the founders of the Queensland Art Society, artist Lewis Wirth, was announced in a local paper. Some time after his return to Australia, Richard received overtures from various London art galleries, and subsequently collections of his works were sent back to England and displayed for purchase. His watercolours and paintings of Australian landscapes and scenery were particularly admired, as they conveyed \\"a more pleasing and favourable impression of the Australian bush and scenery than had hitherto been entertained\\". Death Tragedy struck in October 1906 when Richard Randall died unexpectedly, of what is believed to have been a brain tumour, at Somersby Grange, aged 37. The funeral held on 16 October was well attended by members of Brisbane's artistic circles, including representatives of the Queensland Art Society and the New Society of Artists, who, in a rare moment of unity between the two groups, acted as pall bearers. Legacy Richard's death came as a great shock to his father, who spent much of his time after 1906 promoting the life and works of his son. In 1907 he compiled and published an elaborate memorial brochure, featuring photographs of Richard, his studio and some of his paintings. The studio and its contents were kept intact until , and opened for viewing by the public and eminent guests, such as Govennor and Lady Chelmsford, who visited in December 1906 and purchased several watercolour sketches. In 1909 the South Brisbane City Council was persuaded to accept 600 of Richard's works in perpetual trust. A quarter-acre of vacant land adjoining the studio was offered by George Randall as a location for a gallery to house the collection, however it was eventually housed on the upper floor of the South Brisbane Library, which had been converted from a library space into the Randall Art Gallery. The Randall Collection contained everything from early and incomplete works and sketches to his most prized paintings. After 1922 the collection was added to by George Randall upon his return from a visit to England, where he had purchased a number of his son's paintings from a London art gallery. In 1925, sculptor Charles Lowther was commissioned to make a memorial bust of Randall. The bust was unveiled on 19 June 1925 by the Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan at Randall's studio. When the City Council of Greater Brisbane was formed in 1925 it took over the assets of the South Brisbane Council, including the Randall Collection, which was moved to Brisbane City Hall. Some paintings were hung in reception rooms, while the majority were displayed in a large, well-lit room on the fifth floor. The collection's continuous occupation of the foremost gallery space in Brisbane caused friction between the Council, representatives of the Randall family and the Royal Queensland Art Society, who requested to use the gallery for other purposes. In 1943, after being closed for a year due to lack of staff, the collection was removed from the gallery and stored in the City Hall basement. After the end of World War II, the collection was not reinstated to the gallery and the majority of works remained in poor storage conditions in the basement, or were loaned out or taken without any record being kept of where they went. A 1953 newspaper article claimed that the paintings were being eaten by rats and falling into disrepair; however it was not until the mid-1980s that a concerted effort was made to track down and restore the collection, which had dwindled to 154 pieces. In 2013 the Richard Randall collection remains part of Museum of Brisbane art collection (owned by the City Council. Members of the Randall family retained ownership of the Cordelia Street property until 1981. From late 1913 the studio was rented out as a residence, and at some point the upper floor was partitioned. In a 1926 sewerage plan the studio is named \\"Brindisi\\" and is fenced off from two other residences on the property. In 1987, Richard Randall's Studio was listed by the National Trust of Queensland, who described it as \\"a unique example of a purpose-built artist's studio and reception rooms\\". In 1988 the building was threatened with demolition due to redevelopment of the site; however it was purchased in time by Brisbane City Council in recognition of its historical significance. Only the upper floor (the former studio) was saved and relocated approximately along Cordelia Street to Musgrave Park, while the remainder of the building was demolished. In 1989 the studio was stumped and re-orientated to a north-west aspect to face an avenue through the park. Internal partitions and a lowered ceiling were removed and the building was repaired and renovated, with facilities such as a small kitchenette installed in a rear corner. In front of the studio a timber picket fence, similar to one which had existed at the original location, was constructed. Richard Randall Art Studio, 2013 The studio was officially opened by the Lord Mayor Sallyanne Atkinson, in December 1990 as the Richard Randall Studio, part of the Jagera Arts Centre in Musgrave Park. The Richard Randall Artist's Studio Award, established by the Council the same year, provided rent-free use of the building to selected local artists for set periods as a studio and gallery. Artists were chosen by a panel of professional arts community representatives, and were required to produce a quota of artwork for public use during their residency. By the mid-2000s the studio was in need of repairs and had become vulnerable to damage by vandals. In 2007 it was relocated for the second time by Brisbane City Council to its present site in the Mt Coot-tha Botanic Gardens, adjacent to the main visitor's car park. Officially opened on 6 October 2008 by the Lady Mayoress Mrs Lisa Newman, in the presence of descendants of the Randall family, the renovated studio is used as a function and exhibition venue available to the public and community groups for hire.

Beach Memorial Fountain, officially titled Water Sculpture, is an abstract 1975 stainless steel fountain and sculpture by artist Lee Kelly and architect James Howell, installed in Washington Park's International Rose Test Garden in Portland, Oregon. The memorial commemorates Frank E. Beach, who christened Portland the \\"City of Roses\\" and proposed the Rose Festival. It was commissioned by the Beach family and cost approximately $15,000. Previously administered by the Metropolitan Arts Commission, the work is now part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. Description The abstract geometric fountain is installed in a sunken area on the west side of the International Rose Test Garden's upper level, in southwest Portland's Washington Park. The stainless steel sculpture measures x x . It comprises three vertical posts supporting two horizontal posts, plus two smaller vertical posts which stand alone. Accompanying the fountain is a plaque which reads: The artwork cost $15,000 and was described by Kelly as \\"a symbol of human involvement with the annual renewal of nature\\". The Oregonian writers Janet Goetze and Jean Henninger described the memorial's crossed columns as \\"like an ancient architectural structure\\" and \\"something like Stonehenge\\", respectively. In her book The Garden Lover's Guide to the West (2000), Kathleen McCormack said the fountain \\"provides cooling water music for hot summer days in the garden\\". History The sculpture was created and built by Kelly in memory of Frank E. Beach, who christened Portland the \\"City of Roses\\" and first proposed the annual Rose Festival. James Howell served as architect; additional assistance was provided by David Cotter and the architectural firm James M. Howell and Associates. It was commissioned as a gift from the Beach family—Frank L. Beach and the estate of Ruth B. Mehlin—in honor of their father. Frank L. Beach proposed a memorial in 1973. In May 1974, Kelly's design was selected from six proposals by artists who were granted $200 to complete models. Kelly presented his scale model at a press conference hosted at the Portland Art Museum, where the proposed designs by all candidates were exhibited temporarily. The Oregonian described his plans for the artwork, which would be completed within a year: \\"two 12-foot-high stainless steel arches, joined at right angles, edging a 12-foot square reflecting pool set with water jets\\", with concrete aggregate paths crossing the pool and benches nearby. Beach traveled from Los Angeles to Portland for the memorial's June 14 groundbreaking ceremony at the International Rose Test Garden, as part of the Rose Festival. The sculpture in 2019 In March 1975, The Oregonian said that the fountain would have water \\"gently fall from a pair of steel pillars set within\\" the pool and confirmed that the three benches would also be made from stainless steel. Kelly and the garden's curator reportedly considered having waterlilies in the pool and \\"subdued\\" lighting to illuminate the artwork's columns. The sculpture was dedicated by city parks commissioner Mildred Schwab and Beach on June 14, ahead of the Rose Festival's 63rd annual knighting ceremony. The artwork was surveyed and considered \\"well maintained\\" by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in October 1993. It was administered by the City of Portland's Metropolitan Arts Commission at that time, and is now part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. The sculpture was not wheelchair accessible until the 2010s, when stairs to the area surrounding the installation site were replaced with sloped paths. Reception Willamette Week Shannon Gormley has described the artwork as \\"meditative\\" and \\"one of local legend Lee Kelly's best sculptures\\".

He is an independent representing the 42nd district, encompassing parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Prior to being elected to the State Assembly, he was a Yucca Valley Town Councilman.  Early life and education  The son of a pastor, Mayes grew up in Yucca Valley, graduating from Grace Christian School at 16. He went on to take courses at Copper Mountain College before graduating from Liberty University. While attending Liberty he interned for John Ashcroft in Washington, D.C. Mayes earned a Bachelor of Science in Government from Liberty University. Mayes became a businessman at 23, working as a stockbroker at the Edward Jones office he opened.  Yucca Valley Town Council  Mayes served on the Yucca Valley Town Council from 2002–2011, and was twice elected by the council to serve as mayor. In 2004, Mayes and then-councilman Paul Cook voted against a proposed 42-percent pay increase for town elected officials. In his final budget as Mayor, Yucca Valley spent $8.7 million, a slight decrease from the previous year, and had over $5 million in reserves. In 2011, Mayes resigned as a member of the town council to focus on his responsibilities as Chief of Staff to San Bernardino County Supervisor Janice Rutherford, saying he found it \\"difficult to keep up with the basics of serving as a council member,\\" and that \\"Yucca Valley deserves a council member who will give them 100 percent every day.\\"  California State Assembly  =First term= In 2014, Mayes ran for the California State Assembly to succeed term-limited Republican Brian Nestande, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress that year. Mayes defeated former Palm Springs Police Chief Gary Jeandron in the primary and was elected to the State Assembly in November 2014, with 57.3% of the vote.http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2014-general/pdf/64-state- assemblymember.pdf He was appointed Vice Chair of the Assembly Human Services Committee and a member of the Committees on Governmental Organization, Insurance and Rules, as well as the Special Committee on Legislative Ethics. Mayes was also appointed to the Select Committee on Renewable Energy Development and Restoration of the Salton Sea, and was named Chief Republican Whip. He was appointed to the Little Hoover Commission by former Speaker of the Assembly Toni Atkins in September 2015 and reappointed by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon in January 2018. Mayes was also appointed by Toni Atkins to serve on the California Commission on Disability Access, which works to improve accessibility by fostering dialogue between the disabled and business communities. During his first year in office, he introduced AB 851, which provides an orderly process for municipal disincorporation, AB 1286, which would create a body to holistically examine the state's regulatory environment, and AB 1202, which would have reduced the California State Fire Prevention Fee for residents who also pay for fire prevention at the local level. All three bills received unanimous bi-partisan support in their policy committee hearings. =Assembly Republican Leader= Mayes was selected by his colleagues to serve as Assembly Republican Leader on Sept. 1, 2015 succeeding Assemblywoman Kristin Olsen. Mayes became Assembly Republican Leader effective Jan. 4, 2016. Mayes was the Member who challenged the notion of poverty in California by stating that “California has the highest poverty rate in the nation.” The fact checking website Politifact.com labeled Mayes statement as “True”. To promote his assertion, Mayes placed professionally produced advertisements that were delivered digitally throughout California. As one of his first actions as Leader, Mayes took the entire Assembly Republican Caucus to visit St. John’s Program for Real Change to meet with mothers who have emerged from abuse, poverty and homelessness. Later, Mayes negotiated with Governor Brown and legislative Democrats to craft a health plan tax package designed to draw down in more than a billion dollars in matching federal money. In exchange for Republican support, Mayes secured language to provide more money to help people with autism and other developmental disabilities and forgiving a budget debt owed by skilled-nursing facilities. In May 2017, the California Family Council criticized Mayes for posting a tweet that endorsed Harvey Milk Day. In July 2017, Mayes led a handful of Republicans in the State Assembly to vote with the Democratic majority in favor of AB 398, which extended the state's climate change program – colloquially referred to as “cap and trade” – for an additional 13 years. Mayes, along with six other Assembly Republicans and one Republican in the State Senate, voted for the bill alongside almost all of the Democrats in both chambers, and Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law. The effort was viewed by conservative activists as a vote in favor of more government regulations and increased taxes, and after multiple county parties officially called on Mayes to step down as Assembly Minority Leader, the state board of the California Republican Party did the same. On August 24, the Republican caucus announced the removal of Mayes as the Minority Leader, and he was succeeded by Brian Dahle on September 15. = Wildfire catastrophe fund = Following a series of devastating wildfires caused by electric utility equipment, including the 2018 Camp Fire, Mayes was among the first to call for the creation of a wildfire catastrophe fund. Under California's unusual inverse condemnation liability standard, utility Pacific Gas & Electric was expected to be liable for $30 billion in damages resulting from fires caused by its equipment; this led the utility to file for bankruptcy, calling into question whether the utility would be able to pay claims. Recognizing the need to protect both fire victims and utility ratepayers, Mayes’s plan would create a fund to pay claims to victims following a catastrophic event. In 2019, Mayes authored AB 235, the first legislation introduced to create a wildfire catastrophe fund, and also authored AB 1054, which created a $21 billion fund to pay claims following a major wildfire. =Independent= On December 6, 2019, Mayes left the Republican party and filed for re-election as an independent. New Way California In January 2018, Mayes formed “New Way California”, aiming to broaden the appeal of the Republican Party by advocating for \\"individual freedom, shared responsibility, educational excellence, environmental stewardship, efficient government and an open economy.\\" The group has been publicly supported by former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and both Mayes and Schwarzenegger – along with Ohio governor John Kasich – headlined the group's inaugural summit in Los Angeles on March 21. The summit featured several other Republicans from the State Assembly, including Rocky Chávez, Devon Mathis, and Jordan Cunningham. The summit was criticized by some in the California Republican Party, including former chairman Ron Nehring, who described them as “elites talking down to grassroots voters.”  Election results  =2014= =2016= =2018= =2020= References  External links  * Governmental Website * Campaign Website * Official Biography * Facebook * Twitter Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:California city council members Category:Liberty University alumni Category:People from Yucca Valley, California Category:California Republicans Category:21st-century American politicians Category:1977 births ","title":"Chad Mayes"},{"id":"44514007","text":"Brisbane School of Arts is a heritage-listed school of arts at 166 Ann Street, Brisbane City, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1865 to 1985. It is also known as former Servants Home. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This building was erected in 1865-66. Known as the Servants Home, it provided accommodation for single adult females who had migrated to Queensland and were awaiting employment as domestic servants. Designed by H Edwin Bridges, the building comprised a ground floor and two upper galleries. All four elevations were identical. A notable feature of the interior was the lantern above the void in the two upper floors which provided natural lighting to the building. A 6,000 imperial gallon (27,300 litre) tank under the roof serviced the building with water. The contractors were Messrs Butler and Forster. In 1873 the property was purchased by the trustees of the North Brisbane School of Arts for . The building was let to tenants for several years before it was converted to a school of arts. In 1877 contractor Blair Cunningham added verandahs and other modifications designed by Richard Gailey for a cost of . The new School of Arts building was opened on 17 May 1878. The first North Brisbane School of Arts Building, ca. 1877 The North Brisbane School of Arts was established in 1849 and its first premises were located on the corner Queen and Creek Streets. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it played an important role in the cultural life of the community. The School of Arts provided a library for members, conducted public lectures, and organised classes in a wide variety of subjects. To meet the needs for technical education classes, a hall was added to the rear in 1884. This space was used for the Brisbane Technical College which operated under the auspices of the School of Arts until 1902 when the Queensland Government took responsibility for technical education. Interior view of the library at the Brisbane School of Arts, 1908 The lending library was a major activity of the School of Arts. In 1908, to make room for an increase in the number of books, an extension, designed by Messrs Atkinson and McLay, was built beside the hall. School of Arts building in Brisbane, 1925 Shops added to the front, 1937 Membership of the School of Arts steadily declined during the 1920s and 1930s. To increase revenue, shops were built in front of the building in 1937. In 1955 a brick upper storey was added to the shops with connections to the School of Arts building. The verandahs were removed at this time. In 1966 trusteeship of the property was transferred to the Brisbane City Council which continued to operate a public library at the site until 1981. In 1983 the front offices and shops were demolished and restoration work undertaken. The building was re- opened on 13 February 1985 and let to various community groups. As of 2020 the property has been closed for several years pending renovations.https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/inside-the- brisbane-cbd-heritage-wonder-shuttered-for-years-20190702-p523e3.html  Description  The School of Arts building is a two-storey masonry building elevated above Ann Street. The lower level is of coursed rubble masonry with red brick quoins and string courses. The upper two levels of the building are entirely brick, with the arched headed openings symmetrically arranged. The rolled iron hipped roof is surmounted by a lantern light with projecting eaves. The entry stairs and front and side verandahs contain timber balustrades of diagonal crossed pieces and circular brackets below the eaves. The verandah roof drops in a shallow curve from below the eaves brackets of the main roof to its gutter line. The double height lecture hall and three classrooms (1884) have face brick with timber floors, roof trusses, and corrugated galvanised iron roof. The library extension (1908) is constructed in a similar manner and consists of a double height room with a lantern roof light. The building was restored in 1984-1985. Few interior fittings and furnishings remain, but the organisation of the internal space is relatively intact. Rooms on the ground floor are used for exhibitions while the first floor contains offices and a craft gallery. Original roof strutting is visible in the uppermost floor of the 1860s section and staircases and fireplaces have been retained. The tiered seating and balconies in the first floor of the lecture hall remain.  Heritage listing  Brisbane School of Arts was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The School of Arts is significant for its association with the North Brisbane School of Arts which played a prominent role in the cultural life of Brisbane during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The building remains as a rare surviving example of an inner-city masonry building of the 1860s. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The School of Arts is significant for the successful integration of the extensions under various architects, especially the verandahs designed by Richard Gailey.

It was built from onwards. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Warrawee is believed to have been built in the mid 1880s, for Albert Henry White, owner of the three acre site. E. John White, manager of the New Zealand Accident Insurance Company, was then in residence. In late 1886 the property was purchased by Alexander John Hunter, who does not appear as a resident until the 1892-93 directory, though a James Hunter is listed for 1891 and 1892. Apparently the property was rented during much of its lifetime. In 1924 John Mullan, a union organiser and politician, purchased the house on 2 roods 34.3 perches. The present owners purchased the property in 1986.  Description  Entrance, 2014 Surrounding gardens, 2014 Warrawee is a vernacular style residence, with a most impressive facade and a full sub-floor. The twelve foot wide verandahs have elegant cast-iron balustrading, and brackets and are lined underneath with ripple iron. The verandah portico with its intricate fretwork pediment, groups of columns, landing, gates and iron lace is quite spectacular, complemented by the twin curved stairs with their Scottish thistles in cast-iron panels. The front verandah is supported by emphatic brick piers with elaborate capitals. Upstairs originally comprised a central hallway with two rooms on the left and three on the right, and a kitchen incorporated at the rear. The upstairs windows are all of the step-out sash type, and doors are of panelled cedar. The fanlights are casements with opaque, diamond pattern glass, though grooves suggest the former presence of fretwork panels. The inside walls are lined internally with vertical joint boards and externally with chamferboards which are believed to have been milled locally at Pattersons, Toowong. Downstairs the unlined room on the left of the central corridor, which ran the length of the house, was reputedly the \\"ballroom\\". The righthand side originally comprised three rooms.

He served as a member of the honor guard at the coronation of Catherine the Great, and in turn was given a high rank in the civil service and rewarded part of the estate that had been confiscated from his father, along with 600 souls to work on it. By 1769 he had been promoted to chamberlain. His military career was not neglected either. A colonel by 1765, he saw active service in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 under his Father- in-Law General-in-chief Vasily Dolgorukov, commander of the 2nd (Crimean) Field Army. Major General Musin-Pushkin was a leading participant in the storming of Bendery in 1770, for which he was rewarded the Order of St. George, 3rd class, the Order of Alexander Nevsky and a promotion to lieutenant general. He would be further promoted in 1782 to full general, and made an adjutant general the following year. The General managed to secure his future political position by befriending Grand Duke Pavel Petrovich, the future Paul of Russia. This created some conflict with his relationship to Catherine, who had a troubled relationship regarding her son, but Musin-Pushkin managed to approach this issue with great tact and never compromised his personal obligations to the Empress. In 1786 he was awarded the Order of St. Andrew and made Vice-President of the War College, the commanding body of the Russian Imperial Army. By 1787 he had been made a member of Catherine's Council of Advisers. With the outbreak of the Russo-Swedish War (1788–90), General Musin- Pushkin was made Chief Commander of the Russian forces, numbering some 15,000 men. By 1790, Catherine was disappointed with his performance and had him replaced as commander by Count Ivan Saltykov. Nevertheless, Musin-Pushkin continued to be showered with awards for his war service, including the Gold Sword for Bravery, the Order of St. Vladimir, and Diamonds to his St. Andrew's Star. Under Paul, the Count was made chief of the Chevalier Guard Regiment and field marshal in 1797 but would see no further military service before his death seven years later. His remains were interred in Simonov Monastery. His marriage to Praskovya Dolgorukaya produced two children, Anastasia and Vasily. The latter would go on to have some success in the Diplomatic Corps during the first decades of the 19th century. References *Бантыш-Каменский, Д.

The thermal power plant may be divided into different subsectors and the CFD analysis applied to critical equipment/components - mainly different types of heat exchangers - which are of crucial significance for efficient and trouble free long-term operation of the plant. Overview The thermal power station subsystem involves multiphase flow, phase transformation and complex chemical reaction associated with conjugate heat transfer. Typical layout of thermal power plant. Methods =Finite difference method= Finite difference method describes the unknowns of the flow problem by means of point samples at the node points of a grid co- ordinate lines. Taylor series expansions are used to generate finite difference approximations of derivatives in terms of point samples at each grid point and its immediate neighbours. Those derivatives appearing in the governing equations are replaced by finite differences yielding an algebraic equation. =Finite element method= Finite element method uses piece wise functions valid on elements to describe the local variations of unknown flow variables. Here also a set of algebraic equations are generated to determine unknown co-efficients. =Finite volume method= Finite volume method is probably the most popular method used for numerical discretization in CFD. This method is similar in some ways to the finite difference method. This approach involves the discretization of the spatial domain into finite control volumes. The governing equations in their differential form are integrated over each control volume. The resulting integral conservation laws are exactly satisfied for each control volume and for the entire domain, which is a distinct advantage of the finite volume method. Each integral term is then converted into a discrete form, thus yielding discretised equations at the centroids, or nodal points, of the control volumes. Application of CFD in thermal power plants =Low NOx burner design= When fossil fuels are burned, Nitric oxide and Nitrogen dioxide are produced. These pollutants initiate reactions which result in production of ozone and acid rain. NOx formation takes place due to (1) High temperature combustion i.e. thermal NOx and (2)Nitrogen bound to fuel i.e. fuel NOx and which is insignificant. In the majority of cases the level of thermal NOx can be reduced by lowering flame temperature. This can be done by modifying the burner to create a larger (hence lower temperature) flame, in turn reducing the NOx formation. The role of CFD analysis is vital for design and analysis of such low NOx burners. Many available CFD tools, such as CFX, Fluent, Star CCM++ with different models as RNG k-ε turbulence models with hybrid and CONDIF upwind differencing schemes has been used for analysis purpose and the data obtained with these analysis helped in modifying the burner design in turn lowering the adverse effect on the environment due to NOx formation during combustion.P. J Stopford, “Recent Application of CFD Modeling in the Power Generation and Combustion Industries”, Applied Mathematical Modeling, Vol 26, Pg. No. 351-374, 2002. =CFD analysis of economiser = The economiser is a crucial component for efficient performance of a thermal power plant. It is a non-steaming type of heat exchanger which is placed in the convective zone of the furnace. It takes the heat energy of the flue gases for heating the feed water before it enters the boiler drum. The thermal efficiency/boiler efficiency largely depends on the performance of the economiser. CFD analysis helps in optimizing the thermal performance of the economiser by analysing the pressure, velocity and temperature distribution, and to identify the critical areas for further improvement with the result obtained by CFD analysis. =CFD analysis of superheaters= Superheaters, which are generally placed in the radiant zone of the furnace, are used for increasing the temperature of dry saturated steam coming out from boiler drum and to maintain the required parameters before sending it to the steam turbine. The thermal efficiency of a thermal power plant depends on the performance of the superheater. The CFD analysis of superheaters is done at design stage and later at the troubleshooting and performance evaluation during the operation of the plant. The CFD results obtained can be useful for the maintenance engineer to make suitable predictions of the tube life and make suitable arrangements for the high temperature zone to reduce the erosion of the tube coil and restricting the tube leakage problem. CFD analysis consists of modelling the superheater and doing analysis to study the velocity, pressure and temperature distribution of the steam inside the superheater. The uneven temperature distribution of steam in the tube leads to boiler tube leakage. CFD also helps to study the effect of the operating parameters on the tube erosion rate. Thermal power plants operates round the year and it is not always possible to shut down and analyse the problem. CFD helps in this. =CFD analysis of pulverized coal combustion= In a thermal power plant combustion of fuel, especially pulverized coal, is of significant importance. Proper and complete combustion, with the required proportions of air and fuel, is required for total energy transfer to water for steam generation and to reduce pollutants. CFD models based on fundamental conservation equations of mass, energy, chemical species and momentum can be used to simulate the flow of air and coal through the burners. The results obtained from CFD analyses give insight to identify the potential areas for improvement.Cristiano V. da Silva, Maria Luiza S. Indrusiak, Arthur B. Beskow \\" CFD Analysis of the Pulverized Coal Combustion Processes in a 160 MWe Tangentially-Fired-Boiler of a Thermal Power Plant\\" Journal of the Braz. Soc. of Mech. Sci. & Eng. October–December 2010, Vol. XXXII, No. 4. =CFD application in other areas of thermal power plants= There are some other areas of importance where CFD can play a significant role in performance and efficiency improvement. The unbalanced coal/air flow in the pipe systems of coal fired power plants leads to non-uniform combustion in the furnace, and hence an overall lower efficiency of the boiler. A common solution to this problem is to put orifices in the pipe systems to balance the flow. If the orifices are sized to balance clean airflow to individual burners connected to a pulverizer, the coal/airflow would still be unbalanced and vice versa. The CFD with standard k–e two-phase flow model can be used to calculate pressure drop coefficients for the coal/air as well as the clean air flow.SowjanyaVijiapurapua, JieCuia, SastryMunukutla \\"CFD application for coal/air balancing in power plants\\" AppliedMathematicalModelling30(2006)854–866 The CFD is also used to obtain the numerical solution to address the problem of water wall erosion of the furnace of a thermal power plant. This is caused by flame misalignment, thermal attack and erosion due to the contact with chemicals. The flame misalignment occurs because of alteration in fluid dynamics factors due to burner geometry. CFD results show velocity profiles, pressure profiles, streamlines and other data that is helpful in understanding the fluid flow phenomena inside the equipment.Jairo Z. Souzaa, Leonardo P. Rangel\\" Numerical Simulation of Coal Boiler at Electric Thermal Plants Using Computational Fluid Dynamics\\" 10th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering - PSE2009 It is clearly evident from above examples how crucial is the application of CFD in addressing the bottlenecks in thermal power plants, improving power plant efficiency and assisting in maintenance decisions.

Caskey of the 5th Queensland Contingent, circa 1901 This monument was erected at Toowong Cemetery in May 1902 in memory of Lieutenant Lachlan John Caskey, who was killed in action at Makari Drift, Caledon River, South Africa on 27 September 1901. He was 31 years old. Caskey was a member of the 5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen and, like all Australian troops participating in the South African War (Boer War) of 1899-1902, was a volunteer. As a member of the QIB he was under British command, and his pay was issued by the colonial government at an English cavalryman's rate. The Caskey Monument is the first known South African War monument to be erected in Queensland. A design competition was won by prominent monumental mason William Busby, a public committee was established to raise the construction cost, and the project was sponsored by the Queensland Government. Caskey was a sportsman and school teacher, and his monument was unveiled by the Minister of Public Instruction. The Caskey Monument is one of only four known South African War monuments in Brisbane, the others being the Berry and MacFarlane Monument (1902) at Sherwood , the Anning Monument (1903) at Hemmant and the South African War Memorial (1919) in Anzac Square in the Brisbane central business district. The design of the Caskey Monument, particularly the obelisk and draped shroud, appears to have been the model for the others. Another monument to Caskey, erected near Allora where he had taught, has been lost.  Description  The monument, which consists of an obelisk on a pedestal, is executed in Helidon sandstone and stands high. The white sandstone obelisk is draped in a shroud. A sword is carved in relief on the front face. Below it is a quill, a tribute to Caskey's academic achievements. On the west face are crossed tennis racquets and on the east, crossed cricket bats, acknowledging his sporting interests. This theme is continued with a football on the front of the pedestal. The pedestal also features recessed slabs of Italian marble on all sides, flanked by columns of brown sandstone. The front slab bears a leaded inscription.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built in 1877 by Henry Pears. It was also known as St Thomas' Church of England. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Thomas' Church of England was constructed in 1877 as the second purpose built Anglican church in Toowong, replacing an 1865 timber building on another site. The church, which was designed by parishioner and prominent Brisbane architect, FDG Stanley, has had two major additions, the first in 1886 when the nave was extended and the second in 1947 when transepts and a chancel were added. Toowong was described in 1862 by a local resident, Richard Langler Drew, when he nailed a sign to a tree in the district proclaiming the village of Toowong, although the name of the district had been decided much earlier after the call of local birdlife. Soon after Drew's proclamation many large houses were erected in the area and Toowong prospered as a small elite settlement removed from the noise and dust associated with the town centre. It was not long before discussions were held about the establishment of a Church of England congregation which was to be an extension of the All Saints Church on Wickham Terrace. When Queensland separated in 1859, Brisbane became the seat of an Anglican Diocese and the first Bishop, Edward Wyndham Tufnell was appointed. One year later, state aid to the Church of England officially ceased. Unlike England, where the Church of England was the established church which received state aid, the Church of England in Australia was to survive in the same manner as the other churches then operating in the country. This decision caused much uneasiness during the early history of the church as the hierarchy was unaccustomed to the processes involved with self funding, most significantly the fundraising aspect. Therefore, it is significant that following a meeting on 6 May 1865, Church of England residents of Toowong pledged to assist in the raising of about £150, necessary to construct a building for use as a Church of England. Among those at this first meeting was architect, William Henry Ellerker who was to design the first St Thomas' Church. Also at the meeting was Richard Drew who donated Allotment 13 where the church was to be built in Curlew street overlooking a cutting on Burns Road. In June 1865, another meeting was held and this time it was chaired by Reverend Thomas Jones of All Saints' Church in Wickham Terrace; a manifestation of the diocese's support of the Toowong residents' scheme. The congregation at Toowong was to be part of the All Saints' Parish, and at this meeting details for the construction of the church were finalised and it was decided that the church could also be used as a temporary school as there was yet to be a state school established in the area. By 1866 the first St Thomas' was complete; a small timber framed and clad building with a gabled shingled roof featuring tripartite lancet window groups. The building cost £185.12.6 and was designed by Ellerker, the parishioner and architect, formerly of Melbourne who practised in Brisbane from 1864 until 1866. To defray the cost of the church a system of letting pews was instigated, securing a regular income but exposing the church to allegations of elitism. By 1867 a newspaper reported that the church, with a capacity of fifty people, was inadequate for the growing congregation. It was clear that steps toward procuring enlargements or the construction of a new church were necessary. In 1870 St Thomas' became a parish, independent of All Saints'. The congregation then decided that both enlargements to the building and procuring the services of a minister were necessary. To fulfil the latter requirement Robert Creyke was appointed, but it would take some years before steps toward a larger building were taken. During the early 1870s many memorial items were donated to the church including a stone font commemorating Miss Georgina Hely, still in use today in the parish; an altar, an organ and a sedilia (or altar seat). When Robert Creyke resigned his post in 1875, Benjamin Glennie, a prominent and prolific Queensland Church of England minister was appointed. In the mid 1870s, Toowong was rapidly growing particularly after the rail line was introduced in 1875 with a station at Toowong. While large houses were still constructed in the area, many newly planned streets started to fill with smaller family houses on tighter allotments. By 1878 a State School was opened in Aston Street. In November 1875, at a meeting of the St Thomas' Parish a decision was made to enlist the help of Church of England residents in the area for fundraising and donations toward acquiring a central site for a new permanent masonry church. The construction of a bi-chrome brick church followed the laying of a foundation stone on 17 February 1877. The land on which the church was built, part of Allotment 27, was initially bought by Henry Buckley in December 1853 and then acquired in July 1865 by Robert Cribb, a successful Brisbane merchant. A Certificate of Title was granted to Benjamin Cribb for Allotment 27 in March 1872 and, after changing hands within the Cribb family once more, was acquired by trustees for the Church of England on 15 December 1876. The trustees nominated were William Leworthy Good Drew, Walter Horatio Wilson and William Henry Miskin. The land remained vested in trustees for the parish until acquired by the Corporation of the Synod of the Diocese of Brisbane in 1968. Again, the new church was designed by an active parishioner, Francis Drummond Greville Stanley who was the Queensland Colonial Architect at the time. Stanley was responsible for the design of many large churches throughout Queensland including Holy Trinity Anglican Church (Fortitude Valley), St Paul's Anglican Church (Maryborough), St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church (Carlton Hill, Gympie), St Paul's Presbyterian Church (Spring Hill), as well as smaller examples like St David's Church of England (Allora). The church Stanley designed for the St Thomas' parish, of which he was a longstanding and involved parishioner, followed many of the traditions of Early English Gothic parish churches, most significantly in its picturesque setting. The site was chosen for its centrality and prominence and the church was designed as a landmark on this prominent site. Many of the other features of the building contribute to its strong Gothic aesthetic including its dominant steeply pitched gabled roof, gabled porches, bi-chrome brickwork and lancet window openings, many of which were filled with stained and coloured glass in the twentieth century. St Thomas' Church of England, circa 1900 The foundation stone of St Thomas' Church was laid by Bishop Matthew Hale on 17 February 1877. The contractor for the project was Henry Pears and the building was constructed for about £850. An official opening ceremony in the form of a service was held on 14 October 1877. The first extension to the church was executed in 1886 when the original six bay nave was extended by one bay to form a seven bay nave. This work was designed by the original architect of the building, FDG Stanley and is apparent in the slight variation in colour of the brickwork of the seventh bay, at the northern, chancel end of the church. At this time the chancel was a temporary timber framed structure, to be replaced in masonry when funding was available. In 1887 FDG Stanley designed a Sunday School for the Parish which is thought to have been constructed to the north of the building on land adjacent to the church. Later a rectory was constructed between the church and the Sunday School. A second storey was added to the rectory in about 1900. Choir boys at St Thomas', 1923 The celebration of the 75th anniversary of St Thomas' Parish was to incorporate an extension to the church building, incorporating a tower and a permanent masonry chancel at the northern end. Prominent Melbourne ecclesiastical architect, Louis Williams was commissioned to prepare a design for the building. It is not known whether he visited the site, but the perspective sketch he prepared for St Thomas' is a radical departure from the design of the original building. The additions proposed by Williams displayed a more Romanesque than Gothic influence, with a large parapeted tower partially concealing a pyramidal roof, and a chancel with parapeted stepped facades and grouped openings with, what seems to be, round arched heads. This construction of these additions was to cost £3400 and was to coincide with the construction of the large Roman Catholic Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola nearby. However, although many memorial gates, plaques and stained glass windows were added at this time, the proposed additions did not proceed. By 1947 another scheme was commissioned, this time by Brisbane architect, Arnold Henry Conrad, from the partnership of Conrad and Gargett. His design was more in keeping with the original design of the church and, like the Williams' scheme, incorporated a tower and chancel at the northern end. Although the tower did not proceed, the new chancel was constructed at a cost of £3365 by Ashlar constructions. Like the original building this addition was constructed from brick, but on concrete foundations and with a concrete plinth. In the early 1960s a new low set brick rectory was constructed adjacent to the church, and this and the nineteenth century Sunday School and Parish Hall survive to the north of the church, although a fire in May 1970 gutted the School.  Description  St Thomas' seen from Jephson Street, 2008 St Thomas' Church of England is situated on a prominent triangular site at the corner of High and Jephson Streets, Toowong. The site comprises a brick church surrounded by established plantings and trees and containing early retaining walls, fences, gates and stairs. The southern, entrance end of the church addresses the corner of the two streets, where three substantial gate pillars with an iron palisade gate provide a principal entrance to the grounds of the church. Two sets of concrete stairs containing memorial gate posts and memorial plaques give access from the church grounds to the streets flanking the site. The church is a bi-chrome brick building with a seven bay nave, chancel and a very steeply pitched gabled roof clad with diamond patterned fibrous cement shingles and terracotta ridge capping. A small decorative timber framed fleche at the southern, entrance, end of the church surmounts the apex of the gabled roof, and has a steeply pitched pyramidal roof with an iron cruciform finial. Generally the church is constructed from a dark brown brick and has cream brick detailing, in the form of window surrounds, arched window heads, quoining and string coursing. The church sits on a two course sandstone plinth, the lower course comprises rockfaced blocks and the blocks in the upper course are sparrow picked and margined. The plinth at the northern, most recently constructed, end of the church is constructed from smooth rendered concrete. The southern, entrance facade has an almost triangular facade due to the overhanging eaves of the steeply pitched roof and squat side walls. This elevation is dominated by a centrally located tripartite window comprising three lancets filled with stained glass and with stuccoed sills and heads and all embraced by a cream brick pointed arch. Flanking the principal window are smaller lancets, with similarly detailed heads and sills. The bays of the nave are defined on the eastern and western external facades with angle buttressing, which also lines the southern facade. The buttressing features a tapered head of rendered concrete, from which the timber eaves brackets spring. Diagonal buttressing braces the chancel of the church. Centrally located within each bay is an operable lancet window, filled alternately with figured and grisaille stained and coloured glass panels. At the southern end of both side elevations are steeply gabled porches, which are the principal entrances. These are flanked by buttressing which support the timber framing of the roof structure. The gabled ends are open, with a small triangular timber panel near the apex. The porches provide access to double pointed arched timber doors featuring ornate and overscaled iron strapwork hinges. The northern end of the church comprises a chancel and two transepts. The chancel is a square planned, gable roofed structure abutting the body of the church to which it is similarly detailed although subordinate in height to the principal building. Flanking the chancel are smaller, square planned abutments with hipped roofs, which are in the form of transepts but are, in fact, small rooms, a vestry and a store. Reverend A. E. Loxton at the altar, 1952 Internally the church is arranged around a central rectangular nave dominated by dark stained timber boarded ceiling, on the underside of a steeply pitched roof. Supporting the roof and defining the nave bays internally are a number of dark stained timber, king post roof trusses. At the northern end of the nave is a chancel, separated from the body of the church by a pointed chancel arch. Internally the walls of the body of the church are rendered and scoured to resemble ashlar stone work. Though externally the church seems to have transepts, these projections, in fact, house a vestry to the west and a store room to the east with entrance to the rooms through timber doors flanking the chancel arch. The chancel is boarded to about with timber panelling, featuring carvings of pointed arches with foiled heads. This panelling steps higher on the rear, northern, wall. On this wall and above the stepped panelling is a tripartite group of stained and coloured glass featuring images from the Adoration of the Magi and housed in a pointed arched recess. A number of stone, marble or brass plaque memorials line the internal walls of the church and commemorate various figures in the history of the parish of St Thomas, including RL and A Drew and Sarah Frances Zitella Clark. Many of these memorials were carved by Toowong stonemason, William Busby and bear his signature. As well most of the stained and coloured glass, windows thought to be executed by William Bustard are memorials to parishioners. The tripartite stained glass window in the sanctuary depicts a scene of the Adoration of the Magi.  Heritage listing  St Thomas' Anglican Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Thomas' Church is important in demonstrating both the pattern of growth of Toowong from an elite residential settlement in the 1860s to closer settlement following the introduction of the railway in the mid 1870s. As home to one of the earliest established Church of England parishes in Queensland, St Thomas' Church illustrates the development of the Church in the state. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a fine example of nineteenth century church architecture, showing a strong influence of an Early English Gothic style, which informed most ecclesiastical buildings of the second half of the nineteenth century. Elements of St Thomas' which show this Gothic influence include the steeply pitched and dominant roofscape; the picturesque setting of the building; bi-chrome brickwork; lancet and pointed arched openings; gabled porches; cruciform plan; heavy internal roof trusses and stained and coloured glass. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. St Thomas' Church has remarkable aesthetic value with strong landmark qualities; it is a well composed building picturesquely situated on a prominent site. The building has many well crafted items of considerable aesthetic value including internal joinery, particularly the altar, pulpit, lectern and internal panelling; stained and coloured glass windows of William Bustard; font; various internal and external memorials and landscaping. The established plantings surrounding the church contribute to its picturesqueness and contain remnants of nineteenth and twentieth century garden design. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The church has a special association with the St Thomas' parish as their principal place of worship for about 120 years. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building has associations with prominent Brisbane architect, FDG Stanley and with other early parishioners, many of whom were important in the early history of the Church of England in Queensland.

Such approximations tend to be more accurate for their stencil size (i.e. their compactness) and, for hyperbolic problems, have favorable dispersive error and dissipative error properties when compared to explicit schemes. A disadvantage is that compact schemes are implicit and require to solve a diagonal matrix system for the evaluation of interpolations or derivatives at all grid points. Due to their excellent stability properties, compact schemes are a popular choice for use in higher-order numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes Equations. Example The classical Pade scheme for the first derivative at a cell with index i ( f'_i) reads; \\\\frac{1}{4}f'_{i-1} + f'_{i} + \\\\frac{1}{4}f'_{i+1} = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\frac{f_{i+1}-f_{i-1}}{2\\\\Delta}. Where \\\\Delta is the spacing between points with index i-1,\\\\ i\\\\ \\\\&\\\\ i+1. The equation yields a fourth-order accurate solution for f' when supplemented with suitable boundary conditions (typically periodic). When compared to the 4th-order accurate central explicit method; f'_{i} = \\\\frac{-f_{i+2} + 8f_{i+1} - 8f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}}{12\\\\Delta}, the former (implicit) method is compact as it only uses values on a 3-point stencil instead of 5. Derivation of compact schemes Compact schemes are derived using a Taylor series expansion. Say we wish to construct a compact scheme with a three-point stencil (as in the example): \\\\alpha_1 f'_{i-1} + f'_{i} + \\\\alpha_2f'_{i+1} = b_1 f_{i+1} + a f_i + b_2 f_{i-1}. From a symmetry argument we deduce \\\\alpha_1 = \\\\alpha_2 = \\\\alpha, a = 0 and b_1 = -b_2 = -b, resulting in a two-parameter system, \\\\alpha f'_{i-1} + f'_{i} + \\\\alpha f'_{i+1} + b f_{i+1} - b f_{i-1} = 0. We write the expansions around x_i up to a reasonable number of terms and using notation \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^nf}{\\\\mathrm{d}x^n}=f^n, \\\\begin{align} f_{i+1} & = & f_i + \\\\Delta &f;'_i + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Delta^2&f;^2_i + \\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\Delta^3 &f;^3_i + \\\\frac{1}{24}\\\\Delta^4f^4_i + \\\\mathrm{etc.}, f_{i-1} & = & f_i - \\\\Delta &f;'_i + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Delta^2&f;^2_i - \\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\Delta^3 &f;^3_i + \\\\frac{1}{24}\\\\Delta^4f^4_i + \\\\mathrm{etc.}, f'_i & = & & f'_i,  f'_{i+1} & = & & f'_i + \\\\Delta&f;^2_i + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Delta^2&f;^3_i + \\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\Delta^3f^4_i + \\\\frac{1}{24}\\\\Delta^4f^5_i + \\\\mathrm{etc.}, f'_{i-1} & = & & f'_i - \\\\Delta&f;^2_i + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Delta^2&f;^3_i - \\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\Delta^3f^4_i + \\\\frac{1}{24}\\\\Delta^4f^5_i + \\\\mathrm{etc.}, \\\\end{align} Each column on the right-hand side gives an equation for the coefficients \\\\alpha, b, \\\\begin{align} f_i:&\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ b - b & = 0, &\\\\ \\\\mathrm{(Trivial)}  f'_i:&\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ 2\\\\Delta b + 1 + 2\\\\alpha & = 0, &\\\\ \\\\mathrm{(eq.\\\\ 1)}  f^2_i:&\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ b - b + \\\\alpha - \\\\alpha & = 0, &\\\\ \\\\mathrm{(Trivial)} f^3_i:&\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{3}b\\\\Delta^3 + \\\\Delta^2\\\\alpha & = 0. &\\\\ \\\\mathrm{(eq.\\\\ 2)}. \\\\end{align} We now have two equations for two unknowns and therefore stop checking for higher-order-term equations. \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{eq.\\\\ 2}:&\\\\ b = \\\\frac{-3}{\\\\Delta}\\\\alpha, \\\\rightarrow  \\\\mathrm{eq.\\\\ 1}:&\\\\ -6\\\\alpha + 1 + 2\\\\alpha = 0, \\\\rightarrow  & \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{4},\\\\ \\\\mathrm{and},\\\\ \\\\rightarrow  & b = -\\\\frac{3}{4 \\\\Delta}, \\\\end{align} which is indeed the scheme from the example.

The shooting left eight employees and tourists dead. Another eight were either shot at or wounded. The perpetrators were five Virgin Islanders whom authorities initially believed to have committed the execution-style shooting in the course of a robbery gone bad. However, in court, the defense, led by civil rights activists William Kunstler and Chauncey Eskridge, argued in part that the accused were politically motivated victims of systematic race-based civil rights deprivation; all of the defendants were Afro-Caribbean, while seven of the eight victims were white. Two of the accused, Rafael Joseph and Warren Ballentine, explained that they had only planned on committing a robbery, but that things got out of hand because one of the co-defendants, Ishmael LaBeet, was adamant that they also make \\"a political statement\\" because \\"he was angry about foreigners coming in to take our money and leaving us with nothing.\\" According to Joseph, LaBeet, during the commission of the robbery, suddenly began shooting people while yelling epithets like, \\"I hate you white motherfuckers!\\" LaBeet, who escaped from custody and fled to Cuba in 1984, has denied this version of events, as well as any involvement at all in the shooting. All five men were convicted after a trial in federal court of multiple charges of murder, assault, and robbery, in violation of Virgin Islands law. Each was sentenced to eight consecutive life sentences. The public's perception of a racially tinged motivation for the killings and fear of further violence led to a steep decline in tourism to St. Croix, from which the island's tourism industry did not begin to recover until decades later. On 31 December 1984, the group's leader, Ishmael LaBeet, hijacked American Airlines Flight 626 while in United States federal custody on a transfer to new detention. The flight was forced to land in Cuba, where LaBeet escaped. He was never recaptured. With the thawing of Cuban–American relations in 2015, was confirmed to be living at large in Cuba following an indeterminate amount of time spent in a Cuban prison.

It was designed by James Birrell and built in 1961 by Stuart Brothers. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 August 1998. In 2001, the library moved to Toowong Village Shopping Centre and the original building has been used as business premises.  History  The former Toowong Municipal Library is prominently located on Coronation Drive and was opened in April 1961, built to the design of Chief Architect at the Brisbane City Council, James Birrell. It provides evidence of the City Council's expansion of public facilities in the post war period. Following World War II, when shortage of both labour and materials restricted building work to essentials, the Brisbane City Council embarked on a capital works programme which provided the city with a substantial number of upgraded and new recreational and educational facilities. During the period from 1945 to the early 1960s about ten libraries were constructed and two renovated and redevelopment and construction occurred at five major pool complexes. From the period 1955 until 1960, when most of this vast programme was realised, the Chief Architect with the Brisbane City Council was James Birrell. He was responsible for the design of about 150 sites ranging from his two major projects – the Centenary Pool Complex and the Wickham Terrace Car Park to a number of bus shelters, park entrances, public toilets, cemeteries, sewerage depots and a bus depot. Included in his work of this time was the redevelopment of the Toowong Baths and the construction of a major municipal library at Toowong. Birrell graduated from architecture at the University of Melbourne in 1951, where he was much influenced by one of his teachers, Melbourne architect Roy Grounds. It was Grounds' use of strong primary forms which influenced Birrell's early work, including that work for the Brisbane City Council. Like Grounds, Birrell used highly identifiable forms sited in landscapes which, apart from a reality associated with their function have an abstract reality or quality which relies solely on their form and siting. The Toowong Library characterises this aspect of his work. The library is a twelve-sided figure where the geometry is made more insistent by the walls sloping outward with diagonal external framing. The derivation of the library's form can be explained by book- shelving arrangements and its ring-beam construction, but if it has any meaning in itself this is in having the appearance of a flying-saucer and being easily identifiable at on a busy road. In 1952, Birrell expressed aspects of his architectural philosophy in the Melbourne journal Architecture and the Arts, with which he was much involved. These ideas are manifest in many of his Queensland buildings, including those constructed for the Brisbane City Council. This philosophy described the primacy of material and structural integrity, advocating a new engineering dynamism imbued by the materials, technical knowledge and industrial procedures of contemporary culture. This is certainly one of the enduring forces in his work. Following World War II rapid progress was made in the technology of building materials, particularly in the Brisbane steelworks industry. The new and developed materials and products which Birrell used frequently include acrylics and plastics; concrete screen blocks; and timber based boards significantly plywood. Using expertise gained during the war years, Evans Deakin, local ship builders were instrumental in solving complex geometrics in steel work often required on the projects of Birrell. Of the work James Birrell designed for the Brisbane City Council, very few buildings remain substantially unaltered. Several toilet blocks survive – at Nundah Cemetery, Victoria Park, Mount Coot-tha; two libraries at Annerley and Chermside survive although both have been substantially altered; an entrance feature at Albert Park survives; several buildings in the Abbotsford Road Workshops and the Ann Street Bus Depot survive; two buildings at the Wynnum Civic Centre survive although they have been dramatically altered; buildings survive at the Pinnaroo Lawn Cemetery although later unsympathetic buildings significantly alter the original context; a number of pool complexes survive although many of these have been redeveloped; an electrical substation at Stafford survives and the much altered Centenary Pool and Wickham Terrace Carpark. Many of Birrell's council projects were illustrated in national design journals including the Chermside, Annerley and Toowong municipal libraries, the Stafford substation; the Langlands Park pool complex and the Toowong Baths redevelopment; toilets at Mt Coot-tha; Centenary Pool, Wickham Terrace Carpark and a works depot at Mt Gravatt. Following his years at the Brisbane City Council, Birrell moved on to firstly, the University of Queensland and after to the James Cook University where he was involved in master planning the site, and, from there, to Papua New Guinea where he designed many substantial buildings, before returning to private practice in Australia. The work of James Birrell, particularly during his time at the Brisbane City Council and after, as the architect to the University of Queensland is widely held to be influential, innovative and excellent. The Toowong Municipal Library was opened in April 1961 as the largest suburban library in Brisbane and designed to service the western suburbs. The design of the timber, glass and steel framed building, a twelve sided externally framed form floating on an organic brick base, was controversial and received much attention when completed. The library was constructed on three allotments which were part of a New South Wales Land Purchase by Robert Towns and George Christie. The site was also part of the 1889 Moore subdivision of this area of land and changed hands a number of times before one of the lots was acquired by the Toowong Town Council on 1 September 1903. This lot remained in the Council's use as a storage facility until the decision to build the library was made in 1959. At this time the two other allotments, closer to Booth Street were also acquired. Houses had been constructed on these blocks and these were demolished to accommodate the library. The provision of libraries by municipal councils in Queensland is a relatively new phenomena, with most libraries currently operating established since the late 1940s. Previously, Schools of Arts and privately owned Reading Rooms provided a similar service and these were often run by local committees and subsidised by local councils. Local councils were granted authority in the Local Government Act 1878 to establish and operate libraries, although this was very uncommon until the twentieth century. The first publicly funded municipal library was opened in Kurilpa (West End) in 1929 and a similar library was operating in South Brisbane soon after. Local councils became seriously involved in the construction of libraries in Queensland after the Libraries Act 1943 was passed which provided for the establishment of a State Library Board which was to provide for the improvement of library services throughout the state. By 1950 seven libraries were operating throughout Brisbane and by April 1961 when Toowong Library was opened the Council was operating twelve libraries. Prior to the construction of the Toowong Library, James Birrell designed two other libraries for the Council at Chermside (1957-8) and Annerley (1956-7). The design of these buildings, although modern, were more conventional than the design of the Toowong Library. In 2014 the Annerley Library (with substantial additions) still operates as a municipal library. The much altered Chermside Library was sold in November 1997. Discussions concerning the provision of a municipal library at Toowong started in 1956 when the Council set aside £4000 for the construction of a district library to service the western suburbs of Brisbane. Over the next few years several properties near the Toowong railway station were investigated as potential library sites. It was not until March 1959 that firm plans were made to use the Council storage facility at the end of Coronation Drive. Alderman Ord, the local councillor, announced to the press in March 1959 that \\"a library of brick, glass and steel would be the biggest municipal library in the suburbs and the first in the western suburbs. It would serve the people of St Lucia, Indooroopilly, Toowong, Auchenflower, Taringa, Brookfield and Kenmore\\". Ord went on to say that the library would form a civic block with the recently redeveloped Toowong Baths site. The design of the Toowong Library was innovative and controversial. From the earliest reports of the unusual 12 sided library in 1959, the press covered the story of the planning and growing controversy over the design of the building. The City Librarian lodged a formal complaint over the design of the building with the City Council's Manager of Planning and Building, detailing criticism of the shape, internal layout and lack of consultation with librarians through the design process. In reply to this James Birrell prepared a memorandum addressing the complaints: > \\"The City Librarian has criticised the circular shape of the building, > stating that most library authorities favour the more conventional > rectangular or square buildings as being more economical of shelf > space...his opinion is correct that square buildings have more perimeter > than round buildings. However shelf space is not the only criterion upon > which the circular plans have been adopted...a circular building form is the > most economical for the structural enclosure of a large open space and > results in functional arrangements for the provision of natural light and > ventilation and circulation within the reading room...Criticisms have been > levelled at libraries of all shapes and sizes. Each should be treated on its > own merits.\\" Criticism continued until the opening of the building on 13 April 1961 and it is thought that the reason the project was realised substantially unaltered from the first plans of 1959 and amid the controversy was that the Lord Mayor, Alderman Reg Groom and local councillor, Alderman Ord's interest in, and fostering of, modern architecture. An article in The Courier-Mail quoting Alderman Ord suggested that the controversy surrounding the building was a sign of vigour in the local architecture scene. The building was constructed for about £26,000 by local contractors Stuart Brothers, using innovative construction techniques and materials, with the design involvement of the Engineering Branch of the Council's Department of Works. Many architectural and building journals featured the building following its opening. As early as August 1959 a photograph of a model of the library appeared in Cross-section. In December 1961 an article about the library with photographs appeared in the RAIA journal, Architecture in Australia. New materials used on the library were detailed in the May/June 1961 issue of Building Materials, which featured the building. Such materials included Rotary Red Cedar Exterior plywood panelling, also featured in the Plywood and Plywood Products journal of September 1961. The roof membrane of the library was formed with thick laminated fibre board clad with bituminous felt and finished with white grain render and a copper fascia. When completed, the centre point of the roof of the building was finished with an amber acrylic light dome, apparently the largest acrylic dome produced in Australia at the time. Machinery connected to the upper most level of glazing surrounding the building allowed the windows to be mechanically opened. Installed in the ceiling of the library were two concentric light troughs formed with fluorescent tubes between purlins concealed with a translucent acrylic sheeting, operating in much the same way internal lighting operates with most current suspended ceiling systems. As well there were a number of suspended lighting features of circular fluorescent tubes fixed together on a light framework. The careful placement of the Toowong Library on its site, likened to the work of Birrell's great and abiding influence, Walter Burley Griffin, allows it to be viewed from the street as a one storeyed structure floating amid surrounding vegetation. The rear of the building reveals its true two storeyed nature, but even this view reinforces its floating quality, as the base is an organic form of dark face brick. The skilful manipulation of the site allowed the original entrance to the base and to the library level to remain segregated. The considered landscape design by the Brisbane City Council's parks section includes the use of succulents, rocks and palms and is credited to the talented landscape architect, Harry Oakman. During the 1960s, following Birrell's' departure from the Council, alterations were made to the library including the replacement of the light troughs and suspended lighting features. The library was threatened for closure in 1982 following the opening of a new municipal library at Indooroopilly in 1981. The Toowong Library did in fact close but local residents' action saw it re-opened in 1983. Alterations were made to the building in 1983 when one of the rooms on the lower floor was acquired for use by the local councillor as a ward office. This room which was originally planned as an auditorium was used by the library as a workroom and to accommodate the councillor was partitioned to form a reception, office and storage space. By 2001 the building had been painted externally and the amber plastic roof dome was replaced with a large funnel shaped object concealing an air conditioning plant. The interior of the building remains substantially intact with original unpainted internal timberwork, glazed brickwork on the lower floor and original furniture and fittings including the counter, some perimeter shelving and other shelving units. The building ceased operating as the Toowong Library in 2001 and is privately owned.  Description  The former Toowong Municipal Library is located on the western side of Coronation Drive in Toowong. The library site comprises a two storeyed building sited amid dense vegetation on a corner site, with open air car parking facilities off Booth Street and a terraced area with seating and a playground. The library comprises a cavity brick lower floor, the plan of which is formed by three intersecting circles. Above this base floor is a \\"floating\\" crystalline form with 12 sided polygon (dodecagon) floor plan whose external walls taper outward as they rise and which houses the principal public floor of the library. The external steel wall framing of the upper floor is diagonally crossed, or braced, and sheeted with plywood panels set within the structural framing and framed with silky oak beading. The upper two rows of steel framing are infilled with glazed panels, the top level of which are operable windows. The first floor is a suspended reinforced concrete slab spanning from the brick base of the building to an outer steel channel welded to twelve diameter steel columns, coincident with the twelve edges of the building. The roof, supported on RSJ purlins is pitched upward toward the centre of the building where a large, recently constructed, funnel shaped form houses an air conditioning plant. The roof has been clad with metal decking. The principal entrance to the library floor is via wide concrete steps extending along one of the sides to the east of the building, off Coronation Drive. The entrance comprises a recessed portico from which electronic glass doors give access to the library. Access is provided to the lower floor from a doorway in the rear of the building and via an internal stair. The lower floor of the building is of glazed face brick and contains a number of irregularly but well proportioned timber framed window openings and small concrete panels reflecting the placement and layout of the internal stair. The internal layout of the library floor is essentially open plan, with part-height partitions allowing space to continue beyond room divisions. Central on the floor is a large symmetrically arranged, circular counter and workspace area. The curved counter is lined on the front face with vertical strip timber boarding and this also lines the partitioning on this floor which form the workspace and office beyond the counter. The workspace is a circular semi open room adjacent to the counter. This floor plan of this space is reflected on the lower ground floor as one of the intersecting circles forming the floor plan. On the western side of the workspace is a small office which is formed with 1/2 glazed full height partitioning screens, maintaining the feeling of space in confined areas. Between the workspace and the office is a spiralling cantilevered concrete stair. The interior of the lower floor of the library has a concrete floor and glazed brick walls. Built along the walls of the major work area are original timber cupboards, shelving and counter units. Within a small pod to the north of this workspace is a toilet and bathroom. The other large space on the lower floor accessed via a door at the west of the building houses a reception area, office, and bathroom and storage facilities.  Heritage listing  The former Toowong Municipal Library Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 August 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Toowong Municipal Library is important in demonstrating the provision and upgrading of public facilities by the Brisbane City Council in the post war years. The Toowong Municipal Library, opened in 1961 as a district library for the western suburbs of Brisbane, demonstrates the accelerated provision of municipal public libraries following the introduction of the Libraries Act 1943 and the consequent establishment of a State Library Board. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The library is a rare surviving and substantially intact example of the architecture and planning of James Birrell. Birrell is an architect of national stature and repute and the place is significant as evidence of Birrell's thought and practice. Birrell was Chief Architect of the Brisbane City Council in the period from 1955 to 1960. James Birrell was responsible for the design of more than 150 projects during his six years as the Chief Architect, of these projects only a few survive intact. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is a good representative example of one of the most important schools of thought on architecture in Australia in the post war period; that of the Melbourne School of Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The library has aesthetic and architectural significance as a civic landmark designed, in conjunction with the Toowong Pool, to herald the suburb of Toowong and the western suburbs beyond. The place is a fine example of Birrell's considered approach to siting strong forms within landscapes. The scale, texture, mass, proportions, juxtaposition of elements and siting has produced a fine, well composed building of significant architectural quality. The Toowong Library is an exceptionally fine architectural accomplishment and one of the finest examples of post war architecture in the state. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. As well the building demonstrate Birrell's preoccupation with structural integrity and his use of innovative building materials and techniques which reflected the culture of the time. This was particularly apparent in post war society when many new and innovative building materials and techniques were developed using expertise gained in various industries during the war years. The building was designed to incorporate many innovative building techniques and products and are creative works of the period. The project received considerable attention in national building and architecture journals. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building has social significance and has strong associations with the Toowong and wider Brisbane community as an important public facility of considerable usage and prominence. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building has strong associations with the architect, James Birrell, as a fine examples of his prolific and influential Council work.

Beliefs Dominican Vudú is composed of three main divisions and an annexed extra: Rada Division also known as the white or sweet division, whose spirits are of African origin (usually Fon, Ewe and Nago spirits); the Petro Division also known as the fire or bitter division (mostly of Bantu origin spirits); the Gede Division also called black division (whose spirits deal with death and the ancestors); and lastly the Native American Division also called the water division, whose spirits are of Pre-Columbian origin (usually refers to Taíno ancestral spirits of the island). Most spirits are syncretized with a catholic saints image. These are some of the main features that distinguishes Dominican Vudú from other forms of Vodoo. Some major deities venerated in Dominican Vudú include: *Anaisa Pye, the loa of love and happiness. She is syncretized with Saint Anne. Her feast day is July 26. *Belie Belcan, the loa of justice and protection against demons. He is syncretized with Saint Michael the Archangel. His feast day is September 29. *Candelo sé Difé, Loa of fire, also a warrior and protector spirit. Considered to be one of the Ogou, syncretized with Charles Borromeo. His feast day is November 4. *Santa Marta Dominadora, or Filomena Lubana, the loa responsible for dominion over men. She is syncretized with Saint Martha. Her feast day is July 29. *Ogun Balenyo, the loa of warriors and soldiers. He is syncretized with Santiago. His feast day is July 25. *Baron, the loa of death. He is syncretized with San Elías. His feast day is November 2. *Metresili, the loa of love, beauty and wealth. She is syncretized with the Mater Dolorosa.  Music  Dominican Vudú music uses Afro-Caribbean percussion, a lot of times it is played with drums popularly known as \\"Atabales or Palos\\", which are of Kongo origin; along with it a Guira (metal scraper). The drummers are known as \\"Paleros\\", the ceremonies which they perform are usually referred to as \\"Fiesta de Palo\\" or \\"Maní\\". Some of the most popular artists to record this music are Enerolisa Nuñez and Bembesito.  Characteristics  Dominican Vudú is practiced through a Tcha- Tcha (“maraca” – which means rattle) lineage.Las 21 Divisiones ~ Dominican Vodou In Haiti, Vodoo has come about and become more popular through another lineage known as the Asson. However, before the Asson, the Tcha-Tcha lineage was the prominent lineage in Haiti. Thus the Tcha-Tcha lineage is one of the oldest lineages within the Vodou tradition all over the island. Dominican Vudú practitioners are often called \\"Caballos”, \\"Brujos\\" or \\"Servidores\\" but they are also known as Papa Bokos and Papa Loa (masculine); and Mama Mambos and Mama Loa (feminine). One who has obtained this title has gone through the last and highest level of initiation that can take anywhere between 3 and 9 days and nights as well as have spent a time working for the community. Differences with Haitian Vodou Dominican Vudú is less uniform in comparison to the popularly known Haitian lineage called \\"Assogwe\\". There is much regional variation in the Dominican Republic and parts of Haiti, one will still surely find a base structure throughout the island that defines and connects all lineages. Altars or shrines range from shacks, to compounds, or even dedicated temples. There is also variations in how ceremonies are conducted or how \\"caballos\\" (horse of the spirit) may mount a specific Loa. Differences depend on lineage and or region of practice no matter if in Haiti or the Dominican Republic. It is said that Vodou on the island is a big tree with many branches.

Background The second daughter of William and Lydia Inglis, Milne was born on 1 December 1851 in Lambeth Walk, London, England. In 1855 her family migrated to South Australia, where they settled at Hindmarsh, Adelaide. Milne taught at the Hindmarsh Congregational Church Sabbath School and worked as a shirtmaker prior to her marriage to Henry Milne in 1873. Milne and Henry had four children, none of whom survived infancy and in 1883 Henry himself died. Milne attempted to keep his saddlery business operating but when this failed she returned to shirtmaking. Commitment to improving the working lives of South Australian women Milne's concern over the wages and conditions for women and her own experiences of working 14–16 hours a day lead her to becoming a founding member of the Women Worker’s Trades Union along with Augusta Zadow and Mary Lee in 1889. She was also heavily involved in the pursuit of women's suffrage. Milne differed from both Zadow and Lee in that she was a working woman with grass roots involvement in the clothing trade. In this same year she also became a foundation member of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and she was president of the Bowden branch for twenty six years. By 1892 Milne had her own shirtmaking workshop in her home at Bowden where she employed five other women. In that same year she gave evidence at the Commission of Enquiry into Shops and Factories. Milne spoke of long working days as a cutter, and impressed on the Commission that fatigue and exhaustion were common among clothing trade workers. Role as Inspector of Factories Following the death of Augusta Zadow in 1896, Milne was appointed as South Australia’s second Female Factory Inspector. In her first six months in this role she made 342 inspection visits to factories. Milne later recalled that these visits were ‘greatly resented’ and that she was sworn at, threatened with being kicked downstairs and had doors bolted against her. Milne was committed to eliminating the practice of ‘sweated labour’ and used her inspector’s position to lobby for the formation of an Anti-Sweating League. Milne also used her position to promote the establishment of the Working Girl’s Club, a place for female workers to spend ‘a quiet and enjoyable time, instead of parading the streets’. While Milne at first had the support of her superiors for these activities, when she began to agitate for the formation of a Co-operative Shirtmaker’s Association, J Bannigan the Chief Inspector of Factories wrote to the South Australian Ministry of Industry and the Minister about her activities. In 1904 Milne was forced to defend her reporting to the Committee of the Alleged Sweating Evil and the accuracy of her reports was discussed in the South Australian parliament. Later life In 1907 Milne retired as South Australia’s Female Factory Inspector to become the manager of the South Australian Co-operative Clothing Factory which was owned and run by women and which had been Milne's idea. In 1913 Milne retired to a house next door to the Hindmarsh school that had once been her mother’s. From this house she sold lollies and lunches to the school children. In 1916 she married Hartley Wright Edwards at Holy Trinity Church Adelaide. Only three years later, in 1919, she died of cancer and was buried in the Hindmarsh Cemetery.

A newspaper report of a club meeting in May 1935 confirms this, \\"It is thought that there is a few shillings still belonging to the old Entrance Football Club, so negotiations are being made to have this transferred to the present club's list of funds.\\" The Entrance did not enter the local league competitions in the 1920s or 1930s, and played only social or Challenge Cup matches. The format of the latter involved a club hosting visiting teams from Sydney or other country areas. The visiting side that was the best performed against the hosts was invited back at the end of the season to play a Grand Final. The local competitions experienced a decline in interest in the mid-thirties, and from 1937 the other clubs on the Central Coast played only in Challenge Cup matches. Matches continued to be played during the early years on World War Two. In 1947, The Entrance was a founding member of the Central Coast Rugby League Football Association. The club entered a team in each of the three grade competitions, reaching the final in both lower grades. In the top grade, The Entrance were runners-up in 1948 and premiers in 1949. Three successive Grand Finals were played against Ourimbah, for a loss (7-15 in 1948), a draw (7-all) and a win (15-11 in the 1949 replay). Further A Grade or First Grade premierships were won in 1956, 1957, 1961, 1989, 1993, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2015, 2018 and 2019. The club has had two stints in third tier competitions run by the New South Wales Rugby League, from 2003 to 2007 in the Jim Beam Cup and in its successor, the Ron Massey Cup from 2010 to 2014. The Entrance won those competitions in 2003, 2007 and 2014.

She held six Swiss senior titles in her own division, picked up a total of thirty medals in her career, including a silver from the 2003 European Judo Championships in Düsseldorf, and represented Switzerland as a lone female judoka at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Throughout most of her sporting career, Goeldi trained for the Biel Judo Club in Biel, and also became a full-fledged member of the Swiss national judo squad, under head coach and sensei Leo Held. Goeldi qualified for the two-member Swiss judo squad in the women's lightweight class (57 kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, based on the nation's entry to the top 22 for her own division in the world rankings by the International Judo Federation. Despite having a torn anterior cruciate ligament on her right knee, Goeldi managed to secure two straight victories over 2000 Olympic bronze medalist Maria Pekli of Australia and Catherine Ekuta of Nigeria in the prelims. Facing off against Cuba's Yurisleydis Lupetey in the quarterfinals, Goeldi could not throw her opponent into the tatami because of a knee injury, and had to pull herself out of the tournament through a kiken gachi decision. After the match, she was immediately carried by head coach Leo Held and physiotherapist Pascal Bourban to the wheelchair from the tatami, and was sent directly to the medical clinic within the Olympic Village. Because the ligament had been completely torn in her right knee, medics required her to undergo a six-month rehabilitation and a surgery. Because Lupetey advanced further into the semifinals, Goeldi was also unable to fight against France's Barbara Harel in their scheduled repechage match, granting her opponent a quick victory by a default (a fusen gachi decision). Goldi also sought her second Olympic bid in Beijing, but she had been lingered by foot and shoulder injuries during her pre-Olympic campaign, and thereby decided to retire from judo.

It was designed by George Rae and built by Andrew Lang Petrie Monumental Works. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 2007.  History  Toowong Park, bounded by the Ipswich-Brisbane Railway line to the west, Sylvan Road to the south and Dixon Street to the north, was allocated as a park in 1918 by Toowong Town Council. Following the dedication of Toowong Soldiers' Memorial in 1922, it became known as the Toowong Memorial Park. Since this time, Toowong Memorial Park has been important to the community as a central venue for Anzac Day ceremonies, organised and informal sports, and other recreational activities. The Toowong area (then known as West Milton), was surveyed and divided into several large estates in 1850. In its early days the Toowong area was an upper-middle class suburb, consisting of detached \\"villas\\" on large allotments and made popular by its proximity to the central business district. The opening of the Brisbane to Indooroopilly railway line and Toowong station in 1875 triggered a period of rapid development and a large number of shops and houses were established for the increasing number of residents. In 1880 Toowong's first local authority was elected, the Toowong Divisional Board. However, on 30 May 1880 the area was regrouped and the Shire of Toowong was formed. By the end of the nineteenth century, a large amount of the land surrounding many of the early grand homes had been subdivided into estates. Following sustained growth, on the 19 August 1903, the area was declared the Town of Toowong under the provisions of the Local Authorities Act 1902, and the tram lines were extended to the Toowong Cemetery in the same year. In addition to many other achievements during its time, Toowong Town Council was successful in its focus on securing numerous land allotments for recreational use. Despite the large number of subdivisions that occurred during the later half of the 19th century, a map from 1895 shows the parcel of land bounded by Sylvan Road, Dixon Street and the railway line to retain large allotments. On the 7 September 1918, Toowong Town Council declared the land a park reserve, to be known as Toowong Park. When Toowong was amalgamated to become part of Greater Brisbane in 1925, management of the park passed to Brisbane City Council. Australia's involvement in the First World War exacted a heavy toll in death and injury. Of a relatively small population of about five million people, 60,000 service people were killed and 152,000 wounded. The outpouring of grief in Australia that accompanied these deaths, and the fact that the dead were buried overseas, led to a period of memorial building across the nation and residents of Toowong were quick to commemorate their soldiers by rededicating Toowong Park as Toowong Memorial Park and erecting a number of memorial features. The park's memorial gates were erected to mark both the official opening of the park on 7 September 1918, and to honour people from the local community who enlisted during the First World War. They were originally located closer to the centre of the Sylvan Road perimeter; and were moved to their current location near the southeast corner of the park in 1959. In September 1918, a commemorative avenue of palms was also planted in the park. In 1919 a competition was held to design a memorial for the park. It was won by a young Scottish draftsman, George Rae, who worked in the Brisbane office of renowned architect Lange Powell. The work on the memorial was carried out by Andrew Lang Petrie Monumental Works, who were the largest monumental masonry firm in Queensland at this time. The firm was also responsible for many other First World War memorials throughout Queensland. The memorial cost £700 and was financed by public fundraising. The new memorial was known as the Toowong Soldiers' Memorial and was located on a prominent hill within the park. It was unveiled by Queensland Governor Sir Matthew Nathan on 2 July 1922. Following the opening of the memorial, the park became known as Toowong Memorial Park. Recorded on marble tablets affixed to the memorial are the names of 101 residents of the Town of Toowong who enlisted in the First World War. In April 1993, the Toowong sub-branch RSL dedicated another memorial cairn, located just inside the memorial gates in the southeast corner, intended as the new location for Anzac Day ceremonies. In the same year, part of the memorial avenue of palms was relocated to allow completion of a second oval rugby union oval. The palm avenue remains in this alignment, leading toward the RSL memorial from the main entrance of the park. On Anzac Day, processions continue to march along this avenue and gather at the new memorial for the Dawn Service. The park provides an open space for community activities, recreational pastimes and organised sport, a tradition which is continued today. In its early days, the park was the venue for the annual Sunday School picnics, and the Methodist inter-church children's sporting competitions. In 1919, Toowong Council celebrated the signing of the peace treaty at Versailles by throwing a picnic for the local children in the park. More recently, the park has also been home to local Girl Guide and Scout groups, and the former headquarters of both remain in the park. One of the earliest sporting facilities associated with the park was the Auchenflower Bowls Club, established on Bayliss Street in 1920. The club was sold in 2003 and demolished to make way for townhouses. Part of the land which protruded into the north-west perimeter of the park was resumed by Brisbane City Council. Originally known as the Toowong Rugby Club, the Western Districts Rugby Football Club, formed in 1960, is the only remaining sporting club to still use the park. Wests Junior Rugby Union Club was formed in 1966 and in 1968 a clubhouse was opened. In 1994 the first Women's team was formed. Sharing the grounds until 1999 was the Toowong Cricket Club, also originally established as a section of the Toowong Amateur Recreation Club in 1948. The Toowong Harriers, one of the oldest athletic clubs in Queensland also used the park during the early 1970s. The park is also home to the Vince Hickey Basketball Stadium and neighbouring public half-court. The stadium was used to host the 1994 World Masters Games, and has also been a venue for the Australian Basketball Championships. It is still currently used for Brisbane Basketball League games. The Toowong Memorial Park enjoys regular patronage from the Brisbane public for both sporting or recreational purposes and is utilised by the Toowong Returned Services League to conduct remembrance ceremonies throughout the year.  Description  Toowong Memorial Park is bordered by the Ipswich-Brisbane Railway line to the west, Sylvan Road to the south, and Dixon Street to the north. Park Lane also borders the park for a small portion of the north-west perimeter and the remainder is lined by housing. The park contains a prominent stony ridge, which runs roughly east to west. In the south and south west, the ridge slopes down towards a large flat area of the ground along Sylvan Road, and in the north, slopes towards Dixon Street. The Dixon Street slope contains the remnants of an avenue of hoop pines. The former Auchenflower Girl Guide Hut, a timber hall with gabled roof, is located along the north-west boundary, alongside Park Lane. The old Toowong Scout Hall, located in the south-eastern corner of the park, is a rectangular, concrete block building with a hip-roof. The main oval is located in the south-west corner of the park. Around the northern perimeter of the main oval are numerous buildings and structures of the Western Districts Rugby Football Club. A playground and public toilet facilities are located between the main oval and the far western corner of the park. A car park is located mid-way along the Sylvan Road boundary and is marked by a row of mature fig trees and smaller trees. Mature figs also encircle the main oval, which is neighboured by another football field to the east. A small stand of palms, from the original location of the avenue, runs alongside the north-eastern side of the main oval. A large section of the original palm avenue, which was relocated in 1993, now runs parallel to Sylvan Road from the car park, and then curves gently towards the memorial gates. The memorial gates consist of a pair of red brick piers with moulded stone copings painted cream, supporting a set of decorative wrought iron gates. The west pier contains a marble plaque commemorating the enlisted from the town in the First World War and the marble plaque on the east pier lists the aldermen for the Town of Toowong in 1918. Located in the south-west corner of the park, immediately inside the memorial gates, the RSL memorial cairn. A rough-hewn blue stone boulder monument, standing on a horizontal marble slab, it is encircled by a low blue stone wall which is open to the north and south. A plaque on the cairn records it was erected by the Toowong Sub Branch of the Returned Services League. The Toowong Soldiers' Memorial is located on the summit of the ridge and is encircled by palm trees. Composed of Helidon freestone, it stands high on a square base. It has a fluted Queensland marble drinking fountain, surrounded by carved wreaths and swags. The whole structure is surmounted by a carved cap and ball. Three sides of the monument have marble slabs with the names of the enlisted in lead letters. Twelve stone pillars surround the monument and have metal chains threaded between them. A marble plaque on the eastern pier of the southern opening in this low fence lists those responsible for the erection of the monument. The Vince Hickey Basketball Stadium, located inside the Dixon Street boundary, is not considered to be significant.  Heritage listing  Toowong Memorial Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The memorial gates, Soldiers' Memorial and avenues of trees, created between 1918 and 1922, are important aspects of the park, demonstrating the theme of remembrance and establishing the layout of the park. They are representative of the process of grieving that was occurring across not only Toowong, but also Queensland and Australia at that time. After the First World War, Toowong Town Council, like most Queensland communities, erected a public memorial to honour local participation in the war. Toowong Memorial Park is also representative of the importance of sport and recreation in Queensland's history as demonstrated through the sporting ovals and Girl Guide and Scouts Huts. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The memorial gates in Toowong Memorial Park are a type of commemorative structure uncommon in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. A public park since 1918 and a memorial park since 1922, Toowong Memorial Park is important as an intact example demonstrating early twentieth century ideals and designs for the layout of such places. Elements within the park include sporting ovals and clubhouses, a Girl Guide hut and Scouts' hut, memorial gates, the Soldiers' Memorial and avenues of palm trees and pines which demonstrate the use of the park for recreational and memorial purposes. The memorial gates and Soldiers' Memorial are commemorative structures erected as a record of the local impact of a major historical event, and are good examples of their type. Memorial gates are also a less common type of commemorative structure. The Soldiers' Memorial is also a fine example of the early work of prize winning architect George Rae, who was only 21 years of age at the time, and the craftsmanship of the Brisbane masonry firm, A L Petrie and Son. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Toowong Memorial Park is important for its aesthetic values as it provides a pleasant vista of open, green space in the otherwise densely populated Toowong landscape. The elements within the park are also important for their aesthetic qualities. The memorial gates provide a dignified entrance and display high quality workmanship and design. The Soldiers' Memorial's elevated position and craftsmanship, make a significant contribution to the park's aesthetic value. The abundance of trees, including mature figs and palms, interspersed with open sporting areas, provide for pleasing vistas within the park. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Toowong Memorial Park is important as a community landmark which has been continuously used by the people of Toowong for a variety of social, recreational and memorial functions for almost 90 years. The park, memorial gates and Soldiers' Memorial were commissioned by the Toowong Town Council and are important as a place for remembering the participation and deaths of local Toowong residents in the First World War, and as evidence of the impact of a major historic event. The avenues of palms are also significant for their commemorative function. The park has a long history of use by sporting groups, Girl Guide and Scout groups and strong, ongoing association with the local community, and its aesthetic contribution to the Toowong townscape.

This credit had not been adjusted since its inception in 1976; this bill adjusts it for inflation and the minimum wage. Thurmond's AB 1496 requires the California Air Resources Board to measure and reduce methane emissions to help curb greenhouse gas emissions statewide. AB 1343 helps ensure due process for defendants who are immigrants; it was part of a package of legislation focused on protecting undocumented immigrants. AB 768 bans use or possession of smokeless tobacco products in California's five professional baseball stadiums. AB 2X-9, the Tobacco-Free Schools Act, co-authored by Thurmond and Assemblymember Adrin Nazarian, bans tobacco use on all school district-owned or school-leased property. This bill also mandates that schools post signs reading \\"tobacco use is prohibited\\" at entrances. Thurmond's legislation AB 435 was the first piece of legislation sponsored by the First 5 Contra Costa Children and Families Commission. The bill was signed by Governor Brown and provides more subsidies to early childcare services for low-income families in multiple California counties. Thurmond's legislation AB 1014 moved $35 million from the California prison system directly to local school districts to invest in programs to reduce truancy. Another bill of Thurmond's, AB 1502, reduced paperwork to provide free and reduced lunch to more eligible California students. Previously, only 63% of eligible students were matched to the free and reduced lunch program. As Chair of the Budget Subcommittee #1 on Health and Human Services, Thurmond helped secure resources in the California State Budget for county welfare offices for Medi-Cal eligibility administration, caregiver resource centers, medical clinics to extend urgent care hours, an HIV prevention outreach program, syringe exchange programs and mental health advocacy especially for veterans, youth and racial and ethnic minorities.

The program launched publicly with prominent websites, like The Onion and Mashable among others, to test this service. After November 2015, the program opened up to any publisher who displayed ads on their websites through Google AdSense without requiring any sign-on from publishers. After November 2015, the program was available for everyone in the United States. Google Contributor stopped accepting new registrations after December 2016 in preparation for a new version launch in early 2017. On January 17, Google Contributor was shut down, with the landing page stating \\"We're launching a new and improved Contributor in early 2017!\\" In June 2017, the new Google Contributor was launched, but at some point after that it was shut down again. Some of the pages for Google Contributor still exist, but there is no way to sign up nor to log in, and the link for site owner help just goes to a generic Google help page. In August 2020, some website were available for Google Contributor, such as MTL Blog.  Background  Contributor was invented by Nemo Semret, as a 20% Project. The system allowed users to view online content resources (webpages, video streams, mobile apps), without advertising, by automatically bidding for the publisher's ad slots in real-time on behalf of the user and competing against advertisers. Thus it was a market-based content micro-payment system, ensuring fewer ads for users, and at least as much revenue for publishers as they would get from ads. Users could set a maximum monthly contribution starting at US$1.99 up to $14.99. After February 2016, Google Contributor changed to a fixed subscription fee of $6.99. When the user visits any of the Contributor- supported websites, a small part of the contribution will go to the website owners. The ad blocks, instead of displaying advertisement material, will, by default, display a thank you message with a pixel pattern. This pattern can be configured to contain cats or other patterns. In the implementation, Contributor bids for ad slots on the user's behalf using the standard Google ad auction system; if the user wins the auction, the Contributor image is placed in the ad space, and the cost of the ad is deducted from the user's monthly contribution. If the user does not win, the winning ad is displayed as normal and the user pays nothing for that slot. The website owners are paid for the ad slot as normal, although the revenue could, in theory, be marginally higher due to an additional participant in the ad auction. With the new Google Contributor, each site set its own price independently. This is a fixed price per page view. Each time a visitor views a page, the corresponding fixed fee is deducted from the Contributor balance.

While writing the book Brandon drew inspiration from several kidnappings in the United States and saw this as a way for the character of Toby to \\"distinguish himself from the common vandals and shoplifters Citrus County is crawling with.\\" Synopsis The book follows Toby, a young man that wants to set himself apart from the other criminals and hoodlums in his area. He's decided to accomplish this by kidnapping the young sister of a schoolmate, Shelby. Toby finds himself drawn to Shelby and the two bond over their mutual dissatisfaction with their lives and community, but Shelby has no way of knowing that he has kidnapped her sister. During all of this their high school geography teacher has been made to coach the school's all-girl basketball team while making plans with Shelby's aunt to murder one of his co-workers. Reception Critical reception for Citrus County has been largely positive and the book has received praise from Publishers Weekly, the Sydney Morning Herald and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The Tampa Bay Times noted that the book's location worked in its favor, drawing comparison to the 2005 kidnapping and murder of Jessica Lunsford. The Phoenix and the SFGate both highlighted the relationship between Toby and Shelby, which the SFGate felt added additional pressure to the novel's atmosphere.

Founded in 2007, the organisation aims to empower Dalit women and children in Rajasthan through educational programs, vocational training, and social services. The trust is active in Jodhpur and Setrawa, and reaches approximately 800 per year. Since its founding, it has worked with more than 12,000 children and women in Western Rajasthan. The NGO list About Sambhali TrustThe better India from 29. August 2013 About Sambhali Trust Times of India from 31.03.2015 Rajasthan Day celebrated with enthusiasm History Sambhali Trust was founded on 16 January 2007 by Govind Singh Rathore, after experiencing violence and discrimination against the women of his family. Hence, Sambhali Trust was created to help alleviate Rajasthani women out of poverty and financial dependence on their families. This was initially done by creating a platform to teach basic Hindi, English, Mathematics and sewing for free to women and girls in Jodhpur, and later Setrawa, through \\"empowerment centres\\". The aim of this training is to enable women and girls to acquire the skills and knowledge required to find or create employment for themselves. The name \\"Sambhali\\" means \\"rising of the deprived women\\".Darpan Magazine from 15. March 2014 Sambhali Trust HistoryTimes Now A short video about Sambhali's story Structure The trust now consists of 20 projects: nine empowerment centres, two sewing centres, two educational programs and scholarship funding, the \\"No Bad Touch\\" and \\"Aadarsh - Save Youth, Save Nation\\" projects, one Rural Schools Project, one women's shelter service, one self-help group and a toll- free helpline. Each project is headed by a project manager, with additional support from subject teachers or assistants. 10 teachers in Hindi and Sewing, many of them graduates of the Sambhali program themselves, are employed by the trust, with approximately 15-30 other teachers working on a voluntary basis from all over the world. Predominantly, these volunteers teach English and Mathematics with some specialising in fashion and design and others working within the administration of the trust. The trust has seven trustees, with Govind Singh Rathore acting as Managing Trustee. A national and international advisory board also partake in decision making. Sambhali Trust is financed mainly through foreign donations and grants. Since 2013, the Trust has been affiliated with Austrian, German, Swiss and British sister organisations. Nowadays, Sambhali's Associates are Sambhali Austria, Sambhali Germany, Sambhali U.S., Sambhali France and Sambhali UK respectively. Donations through these sister organisations are all directed to the central, Indian based Trust. Projects Located across Jodhpur and Setrawa, empowerment centers provide women and girls with cost free access to education in Hindi, English, and Mathematics. Women are also trained in the traditional arts of sewing and needlework. This enables them to manufacture their own products after training, or to go on and work for Sambhali Trust in the sewing centres. The sewing centres employ over 20 women to produce handmade fashion and accessories for the Sambhali Boutique, based in Jodhpur, as well as bespoke orders for overseas.The Hindu from 30.

Sambhali Trust during COVID-19 During the lockdown in 2020, Govind Singh Rathore's family and some people of the NGO moved to his village Setrawa. There, most of the people work in mines as laborers and were hit badly by the total lockdown. In the strong summer heat of the Indian Thar Desert, some women walked miles to ask the trust for any possible help. By the end of March 2020, the NGO started to distribute food packages including flour, rice, chili, turmeric & chai powder, sugar, salt, oil & lentils to 22 tribal families around the family home. A few days after, the Trust established its new project and helped more than 500 families by delivering 2,300 ration kits in 12 villages of Dechu Tehsil from end of March until end of July. Additionally, more than 2,000 masks were and are still delivered to people in need, police officers and laborers in the desert and Jodhpur. Around 1,500 additional families were informed about COVID-19 and were given soaps & masks by our international and national volunteers who went into the field. Even though the main deliveries stopped by the end of June, Sambhali is still supporting 22 vulnerable families with food rations for 15 days and is using its Nirbhaya tollfree helpline number for this matter as well. During the extreme lockdown, the NGO’s Headquarter was offered to the local administration in Jodhpur for isolation camps and shelters. References 13\\\\.

He is a Republican representing the 26th District, encompassing southeastern parts of the Central Valley. Before joining the Assembly, Devon served for 10 years as a Sergeant in the Army National Guard, including two tours in Iraq. During his second tour in Iraq, Devon was severely injured in a roadside bomb attack, for which he was awarded a Purple Heart. He holds a Bachelor's Degree in Public Administration from Fresno State University, and an Associate Degree in Social Sciences from Porterville College. Devon and his wife, Aubrey live in Visalia with their five children. His election in 2014 was a surprise to many when he defeated Woodlake Mayor Rudy Mendoza, a fellow Republican who was better known and had much support from established Republicans. Mendoza sought a rematch in 2016, but Mathis defeated him again in the primary. Mathis, who had no previous political experience, ran on his status as a former US Army sergeant and veterans advocate. However, a controversy arose when it was revealed that he had been collecting both his 100% VA disability benefits and his state salary as an Assemblyman, including benefits. In July 2017 Mathis, along with four other Republican assemblymen, voted \\"Yes\\" on AB 398 to extend California's Cap and Trade program. In 2018, Mathis was vigorously challenged for reelection. In the primary, he won only 30% of the vote, narrowly defeating Republican Visalia Mayor Warren Gubler. But in the November runoff, he rallied and defeated Democratic Tulare City Councilman Jose Sigala with 58% of the vote. Allegations of sexual assault In October 2017 it was announced by the Sacramento Police Department that Mathis was being investigated for an alleged sexual assault against a female member of his staff. A conservative political blog, American Children First, reported that sources had informed them that Mathis and several staff members had gone out drinking and returned to the home of one of the staff members. There, it was alleged, an inebriated female staff member had gone into a bedroom and passed out on the bed, and Mathis was alleged to have \\"digitally penetrated\\" her while she was unconscious. Regarding the incident, Mathis' office released this statement: “We have a policy of not responding to unsubstantiated, random social media posts.” A spokesman for the Sacramento Police Department. said that “information of a possible sexual assault was brought to our attention. We are starting to follow up with the information we have.\\" California Assembly officials disciplined Mathis for violating the body's sexual harassment policy. They found that he frequently engaged in the utterance of coarse language and made sexual remarks about fellow lawmakers. 2014 California State Assembly  2016 California State Assembly  2018 California State Assembly  2020 California State Assembly  References  External links  * * Campaign website * Debating rises Around Mathis's Veteran Benefits *A Bipartisan vote for climate action Category:Living people Category:People from Visalia, California Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:California Republicans Category:21st-century American politicians Category:1982 births ","title":"Devon Mathis"},{"id":"44514564","text":"Yuan Xian (born 515 BC), courtesy name Zisi or Yuan Si, was a major disciple of Confucius. Classic Chinese sources stated he was modest and incorruptible, and adhered strictly to the teachings of Confucius despite living in abject poverty. Life Yuan Xian was born in 515 BC, 36 years younger than Confucius. His origin is uncertain. The Kongzi Jiayu says he was a native of the State of Song, but according to Han dynasty Confucianist Zheng Xuan, he was from the State of Lu. Yuan Xian was Confucius' chief household officer when Confucius served as Minister of Justice of Lu. After the death of his master, Yuan Xian moved to the State of Wey, where he lived in obscurity and poverty. The Zhuangzi and the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) both record a conversation between Yuan Xian and Duanmu Ci (Zigong), another well- known disciple of Confucius. Zigong, who served as a high official and was a wealthy businessman, went to visit Yuan Xian's village in his quadriga. According to these texts, Yuan lived in a tiny hut with a thatched roof, reached via alleys too narrow for a chariot. Zigong expressed pity and shame at Yuan's distress, but Yuan Xian countered that he was able to put the Tao into practice, and lived a life of poverty but not of distress. The chronicles stated that for the rest of his life, Zigong felt ashamed of his own words.. Legacy In Confucian temples, Yuan Xian's spirit tablet is placed in the outer court, beyond those of the Four Assessors and Twelve Wise Ones. During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously awarded Yuan Xian the nobility title of Count of Yuan (原伯). During the Song dynasty, he was further awarded the title of Marquis of Rencheng (任城侯).

She is a Democrat. Prior to being elected to the Assembly, she was a community representative for the North Valley Occupational Center-Aviation Center. After serving in the Assembly, she ran for a seat on the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education, but did not make the run-off election. Personal life She arrived in the United States at the age of 12 from Michoacán, Mexico, speaking no English. Her parents did not enroll her in public school. Ultimately, she taught herself how to read and write in English and re-enrolled in adult night school at the age of 18 in order to earn her high school diploma. Having worked since the age of 14, she held various jobs as a housekeeper, children's nanny, fast food worker, factory worker, and educational advocate. Her experience of having to seek out education as an adult instilled a lifelong interest in public education for her. She helped found the Padres Activos of the San Fernando Valley, an organization dedicated to helping immigrant parents secure their children's academic rights in public school. Career =2014 California State Assembly = In 2014, she ran for office for the first time and was elected to the California State Assembly, defeating the incumbent. She was immediately accused of numerous serious campaign finance violations by her opponents, including money laundering, purposefully hiding donors, and secretly arranging independent expenditures to benefit her. She was subjected to an over year long investigation by the California Fair Political Practices Commission. The Commission ultimately exonerated her of all serious charges although they found some minor infractions in record-keeping and she was fined accordingly.http://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/documents/Stipulations/2016/March/06%20Patricia%20Lopez%20-%20Campaign%20Reporting-%20Mar-2016%20-%20Fine$7500.pdf Her most serious campaign finance law violation was her failure to properly deposit approximately $800 in campaign funds raised from selling homemade pupusas and tamales on the side of a freeway off-ramp into her campaign bank account first before spending it on campaign t-shirts for her volunteers. Since joining the Assembly, Patty López has authored several pieces of legislation that have been successfully enacted into law. Her most important piece of legislation was the Right to Dry bill, which prohibits apartment complexes and multiple family residential dwellings from banning individuals who wish to dry their clothing on a clothes line. She also authored legislation to require an independent film maker to sit as a boardmember on California's Filming Commission. In 2016, she was honored by the National Women's Political Caucus as the recipient of their annual Leadership award. She was also given the annual Green Leadership Award in 2016. She notably authored a bill to make prosecutorial misconduct a felony offense. Although she was accused of being a secret Republican, Patty López earned a perfect score from the Courage Campaign in their review of her 2015 voting record. She also has led activist rallies in her community in defense of the rights of undocumented immigrants and the rights of transgender individuals. Patty López has also been known to occasionally give remarks on the State Assembly floor in Spanish, which is her first language.

It was first published in 1966, and since 2004 has been updated every three to six years. The most recent version of the standard was published in 2017.  Organization of standard  The body of the standard consists of a foreword (describing changes made in the current version), eight sections and two normative appendices: # Purpose # Scope # Definitions # General requirements # Conditions that provide thermal comfort # Design compliance # Evaluation of comfort in existing buildings # References : Normative Appendix A: Methods for determining operative temperature : Normative Appendix B: Computer program for calculation of PMV/PPD After the body of the standard there are 11 informative appendices. These are not part of the standard, but provide additional information about terms and methods described within the standard, as well as a bibliography, and a description of the addenda incorporated from the previous version in the current version.  Purpose  As described within the standard: \\"The purpose of the standard is to specify the combinations of indoor thermal environmental factors and personal factors that will produce thermal environmental conditions acceptable to a majority of the occupants within the space\\".  Scope  The standard addresses the four primary environmental factors (temperature, thermal radiation, humidity, and air speed) and two personal factors (activity and clothing) that affect thermal comfort. It is applicable for healthy adults at atmospheric pressures in altitudes up to (or equivalent to) , and for indoor spaces designed for occupancy of at least 15 minutes.  Definitions  = Adaptive model = Adaptive model is a model that relates indoor design temperatures or acceptable temperature ranges to outdoor meteorological or climatological parameters. = Thermal comfort = Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation. = Occupant-controlled naturally conditioned spaces = A occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space is where the thermal conditions of the space are primarily regulated by occupant- controlled openings. = Predicted mean vote (PMV) = Predicted mean vote is an index that predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation votes (self- reported perceptions) of a large group of persons on a sensation scale expressed from -3 to +3 corresponding to the categories \\"cold,\\" \\"cool,\\" \\"slightly cool,\\" \\"neutral,\\" \\"slight warm,\\" \\"warm,\\" and \\"hot.\\" = Comfort zone = Comfort zone refers to the combinations of air temperature, mean radiant temperature (tr), and humidity that are predicted to be an acceptable thermal environment at particular values of air speed, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation (Icl) = Clothing insulation (Icl) = Clothing insulation is the resistance to sensible heat transfer provided by a clothing ensemble (expressed in units of clo, which is a unit to quantify the insulation provided by garments and clothing ensembles. 1 clo = 0.155 m² °C/W (0.88 ft²·h·°F/Btu)) = Metabolic rate (met) = Metabolic rate is the rate of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities of an individual, per unit of skin surface area (expressed in units of met) equal to 58.2 W/m² (18.4 Btu/h·ft²), which is the energy produced per unit skin surface area of an average person seated at rest. = Exceedance hours = Exceedance hour is the number of occupied hours within a defined time period in which the environmental conditions in an occupied space are outside the comfort zone.  Methods to evaluate thermal comfort  = Graphic comfort zone method = The graphic method utilizes an overlay on a psychrometric chart to indicate the operative temperatures and humidity at which thermal comfort is achieved in the winter (1.0 clo) and summer (0.5 clo). It is based on the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model. The graphic comfort zone model is limited in applicability to conditions when the metabolic rate of occupants is 1.0-1.3 met and the humidity ratio is below 0.012 kg H2O/kg dry air (0.012 lb H2O/lb dry air). If these requirements are met and the environmental conditions inside the building fall within the indicated ranges, then compliance is achieved. = Analytical comfort zone method = For humidity ratios above 0.012 kg H2O/kg dry air (0.012 lb H2O/lb dry air), or for metabolic rates up to 2.0 met, the analytical model must be used to determine thermal comfort sensation. Also based on the PMV model, this method uses tools such as the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool or the online CBE Thermal Comfort Tool to evaluate thermal comfort. Users provide operative temperature (or air temperature and mean radiant temperature), air speed, humidity, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation value, and the tool evaluates predicted thermal sensation on a scale from -3 (cold) to +3 (hot). Compliance is achieved if the conditions provide thermal neutrality, measured as falling between -0.5 and +0.5 on the PMV scale. = Elevated air speed = The section sets provisions for increasing the upper air temperature limit at elevated air speeds above . The methodology is based on the SET (Standard Effective Temperature) model, which provides a way to assign an effective temperature (at a standard metabolic rate, and clothing insulation values) to compare thermal sensations experienced at a range of thermal conditions. The upper limit of air speed is based on whether occupants have local control or not. To evaluate compliance, the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool may be used, or a computer model validated against the code provided in Informative Appendix D of the standard. = Local thermal discomfort = Radiant temperature asymmetry between ceiling and floor, and air and walls must be limited to reduce discomfort. To reduce draft risk at temperatures below , air speed due to the HVAC system must be or below. The vertical air temperature difference between ankle and head is limited to for seated occupants and for standing occupants. If occupants' feet will be in contact with the floor, the temperature must be . = Temperature variations with time = When occupants do not have control over the cyclical variation or drifts in indoor environmental conditions, the conditions within this section must be met. Operative temperatures may not fluctuate more than within 15 minutes, nor change more than within 1 hour. = Acceptable thermal conditions in occupant- controlled naturally conditioned spaces = This method, also known as the adaptive comfort model, is applicable in buildings without mechanical cooling (and no operating heating system) where occupants’ met rates are 1.0-1.3 met and their clothing levels are 0.5-1.0 clo. For this model the standard provides a graph of acceptable indoor temperature limits at prevailing mean outdoor temperatures (a mean of the daily mean outdoor temperatures of the previous 7–30 days). An accompanying table lists provisions for higher operative temperatures at air speeds above and up to . The graph is valid for prevailing mean temperatures between . It provides 80% and 90% acceptability ranges, indicating the percentage of occupants expected to be comfortable at the indicated indoor and prevailing mean outdoor temperatures.  Demonstrating design compliance  This section of the standard is applicable for the design of buildings. All of the building systems must be designed to maintain the occupied spaces at the indoor conditions specified by one of the described evaluation methods at design conditions. The systems must be able to maintain these conditions within the expected range of indoor and outdoor operating conditions. To demonstrate compliance the following must be documented, where applicable. Sample documentation is provided in Informative Appendix J. * Method of compliance (e.g. Graphic Comfort Zone Method) * Design operative temperature and humidity, heating and cooling design outdoor conditions, total indoor loads, and design exceedance hours * Assumed values for environmental factors (operative temperature, humidity, and average air speed) and personal factors (clothing insulation and metabolic rate) for heating and cooling design conditions; spaces where personal factors are outside the specified limits should be indicated as not within the standard’s scope * A description of how local thermal discomfort will be addressed, including calculation methods, inputs and results * System equipment capacities for each space demonstrating that thermal loads will be met under heating and cooling design conditions * Where occupant-controlled elevated air speed is provided, a description of control type * Air speed, radiant temperature asymmetry, vertical radiant temperature asymmetry, surface temperatures, and temperature variations in time must be calculated per engineering industry standards (e.g. Chapter 57 of the ASHRAE Handbook-HVAC Applications)  Evaluation of comfort in existing buildings  Although the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 does not require the evaluation of comfort in existing building, this part of the standard offers a guideline of performing an evaluation when one is required from other codes or standard. Generally, the evaluation of comfort in existing buildings can be performed from two perspectives: from occupant satisfaction survey and physical environmental measurements. = Measurement methods =  Occupant Survey  Indoor thermal comfort can be determined from the responses of the occupant survey. The survey shall be distributed to the entire occupancy or representative part of the occupancy. The standard suggests that if the surveys were distributed to more than 45 occupants, the response rate must exceed 35%. If that number is between 20 and 45, the minimum number of responses is 15. When the number is under 20, at least 16 must reply for the survey to make the survey representative. For satisfaction surveys, the thermal satisfaction scale shall end with choices: \\"very satisfied\\" and \\"very dissatisfied\\", and, also, the occupants should be allowed to explain their dissatisfaction by answering an open-ended question. As for point-in-time surveys, the survey should be solicited during the time of occupancy, and the satisfaction scale ought to be continuous. There should be at least seven points on the scale ending with \\"very acceptable\\" and \\"very unacceptable.\\" The standard also specifies that when asking thermal sensation questions, the scale should be \\"cold, cool, slightly cool, neutral, slightly warm, warm, and hot.\\"  Physical measurements  For mechanically conditioned spaces, the PMV-based comfort zone has to be determined, which includes measuring and recording the metabolic activity and clothing insulation. The comfort zone boundaries must be adjusted to the air movements, and the zone conditions should be adjusted to avoid local thermal discomfort. For occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space, the adaptive model shall be used to determine the thermal comfort boundaries. For such spaces, the indoor and outdoor air temperature and mean radiant temperature and the air speed need to be measured. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 provides guideline on the position, time, and equipment accuracy of the physical measurement. The measurement locations should be where the occupants are expected to spend time in. If there are multiple such locations, the measurement can be performed at a representative location. In cases that the optimal representative location cannot be found, the standard suggests specific locations in the space. For seating occupants, the air temperature and air speed measurements shall be taken at heights of 0.1, 0.6, and 1.1 m (4, 24, and 43 in.), and operative temperature and PMV shall be measured at 0.6 m (24 in.). The heights need to be adjusted for standing persons. Local discomfort caused by radiant temperature asymmetry shall be measured at occupants’ locations, with the sensors oriented to catch the maximum surface temperature differences. The standard suggests that the time of measurements should last two or more hours long, and it should also be a representative time of the year for this specific building. Measuring time step should be no more than five minutes for air temperature, mean radiant temperature, and humidity, and no more than three minutes for the air speed. In order to achieve acceptable results, the standard also suggests the minimum equipment accuracy based the current industry standard. When extracting environmental data from the Building Administration System, one should evaluate the location, height, and time step of the sensors based on the previous suggestion. = Evaluation methods =  Occupant Survey  To evaluate the probability of satisfaction from satisfaction surveys, the standard suggests dividing the number of the votes falling between \\"just satisfied\\" and \\"very satisfied\\" by the total number of votes in that questions. The answers of open-ended questions from \\"very dissatisfied\\" occupants should be documented for later analysis. For point-in-time surveys, the comfort evaluation shall be performed by dividing the number of votes between -1 and +3 by the total number of votes. One has to keep in mind that the results from point-in-time surveys are only effective during the time when the surveys were solicited.  Physical measurements  The measured results should be evaluated against the adjusted comfort zone for the specific building. There are two cases when evaluating thermal comfort: at a specific time or over a period of time. For a mechanically conditioned space at an instance in time, the PMV and SET model shall be used to establish the comfort zone, and the local thermal discomfort shall be evaluated against the limit posed this standard as well. For occupant-controlled naturally conditioned spaces, the measured results shall be check with the comfort zone established by adaptive model. To evaluate the thermal comfort over a period of time in a mechanically conditioned space, the exceedance hours are the sum of all the hours when the absolute value of PMV is greater than 0.5. For an occupant- controlled naturally conditioned space, the exceedance hours are the sum of hours when the operative temperature falls outside of the lower and upper boundaries of the comfort zone.  Appendix D: Use the metabolic rate data  Metabolic rate is the rate of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities of an individual. It is defined as per unit of skin surface area which equals to 58.2 W/m² (18.4 Btu/h·ft²). This is the energy produced from a unit skin surface area of an average person seated at rest. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 provides a table of metabolic rate of different continuous activities. These values are valid for an average adult with surface skin area of 1.8 m² (19.6 ft²). The standard reminds the users that they should use their own judgment to match the activities being considered to the comparable activities in the table. Except sedentary activities, metabolic rate for all other activities is likely to have range of variation. This variation is depending on the individual performing the task and his/her environment. When the duration of an activity is equal or less than one hour, one can use a time-weighted metabolic rate. As metabolic rates increase over 1.0 met, the evaporation of the sweat becomes an increasingly important factor, and the PMV method does not fully account for this factor.  Appendix E: Clothing insulation  Clothing insulation refers to the heat transfer of the entire body, which includes the uncovered parts, such as hands and heads. There is a variety of means to determine the insulation provided by clothing. Accurate data from the measurement using thermal manikins is acceptable. When such measurement is not feasible, this standard provides four methods to determine the clothing insulation. It is also specified that the methods provided by this standard are no longer valid when the clothing insulation exceed 1.5 clo. And it is also not valid when occupants wear clothing that is highly impermeable to moisture transport. The first method is the least accurate, according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55, and the accuracy increases in order of the methods. First, one can estimate the clothing insulation from the table provided in section five. If the clothing ensemble in question reasonably matches the clothing ensemble in the table, the indicated value can be used. The second method is to add or subtract individual garment clo value to achieve the clothing ensemble in question. Section five of the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 provides a table with clothing insulation of a variety of individual garments. This table can be used together with the previous one, so that one can add or subtract the clothing ensemble from the clo value of each garment. The third method is to add all the clo value of each garment to match the clothing ensemble in question. The fourth method described in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 can be used to determine the clothing insulation in mechanically conditioned spaces. This method is based on the concept that when occupants choose their clothing according to their environment, the outdoor environment is more influential than the indoor one. There is a figure in the section five of the standard which predicts the representative clothing insulation of the occupants as a function of the average outdoor air temperature at 06:00 am. The function line has four segments: the average outdoor air temperature is below , between and , between and , and above . There is a function to determine the representative clothing insulation at each segment. One can also take into account the posture of the occupants. So far, all the clothing insulation value can be used when the occupant is standing. When occupant is sitting, one has to realize the insulation effect of the chair, and the decrease of insulation due to compression of the air in the clothing. If the occupant is moving, it also affects the insulation value of clothing. In general, body motion decreases the clothing insulation by pumping air through clothing. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 recognizes that this effect varies largely depending on the nature of the movements and the nature clothing, such as how tight the clothing is. Thus, it only provides an approximation of the clothing insulation value of a moving person. This approximation is an equation that relates the clothing insulation with the metabolic rate. And this equation is only valid when the metabolic rate is between 1.2 and 2.0. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 also states that the thermal environment conditions desired for sleeping and resting vary largely among individuals and cannot be determined using the methods provided in this standard. Considering that a sleeping person or one in reclining posture will be provided with sufficient insulation with the bedding material, and he or she is also free to adjust, it is impossible to determine the clothing insulation effect for these occupants unless they are immobile. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 cautious the users that there are two forms of variability among occupants. In the first form, different individuals wear different clothing due to factors that are not related to thermal conditions, and the second form is opposite. For the first, it is not correct to use the average clothing insulation value to determine the desired thermal conditions for all occupants.  History of the standard  ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 was first published in 1966. It was revised in 1974, 1981, 1992, 2004, 2010, 2013 and 2017. Starting in 2004, it is now updated based on ASHRAE’s standard maintenance procedures. These periodic revisions are based on publicly reviewed addenda to the previous version available on ASHRAE’s website. In 1992 the standard was updated with more extensive information on measurement protocols and an expanded definitions section. In 2004 the standard underwent significant changes with the addition of two thermal comfort models: the PMV/PPD model and the adaptive comfort model. In 2010 the standard included the following changes. It re-introduced the Standard Effective Temperature (SET) as a method to calculate the cooling effect of air movement. It also added a general satisfaction survey to section 7 intended to evaluate general thermal comfort in an occupied space, bringing the standard in line with current survey-based post-occupancy evaluation (POE) practices. In 2013 the body of the standard was rewritten in mandatory language, with informative language moved from the body of the standard to informative appendices. The applicability of the cooling effect of air movement was expanded to apply to naturally conditioned spaces. Section 7 underwent major revisions for measuring thermal comfort in existing spaces including procedures for physical measurements and survey methods, and how to evaluate and report results. The last major change concerns measuring air speed and air temperature experienced by the occupant, which now must be an average across three heights and over a period of time.

Biography  Born in the Los Angeles area, Kruger grew up in South Pasadena, Her mother is Jamaican and her father is Jewish. She attended Polytechnic School in Pasadena, California. She then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude from Harvard University, where she wrote for the Harvard Crimson and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She graduated with a Juris Doctor degree from Yale Law School, where she served as Editor-in-Chief of the prestigious Yale Law Journal. In the summer of 1999, she interned at the United States Attorney's office in Los Angeles. In 2000, she worked as a summer associate at Munger, Tolles & Olson. Kruger worked as an associate at the Jenner & Block law firm from 2001 until 2002. She then worked as a law clerk for Judge David Tatel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 2002 until 2003. Kruger then clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens of the United States Supreme Court from 2003 until 2004. From 2004 to 2006, Kruger was an associate at Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale and Dorr. She was a visiting assistant professor in 2007 at the University of Chicago Law School. From 2007 to 2013, Kruger was an assistant to the United States Solicitor General and the acting principal deputy solicitor general. She argued 12 cases before the US Supreme Court. In 2013, Kruger became a deputy assistant attorney general at the United States Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel. On November 24, 2014, Governor Jerry Brown announced the appointment of Kruger to the California Supreme Court. She was confirmed on December 29, 2014, and replaced Associate Justice Joyce L. Kennard, who retired. She was sworn in on January 5, 2015 and became the court's second African-American woman justice, following Janice Rogers Brown. At 38, she was the youngest appointee to the court in recent years and the third youngest appointee to the court ever, after Hugh C. Murray and M. C. Sloss. In November 2015, Kruger delivered the annual Bernard E. Witkin lecture before the Los Angeles County Bar Association. Her opinions include Barry v. State Bar of California (2016), concerning subject matter jurisdiction and California's anti-SLAPP statute.Barry v. State Bar of California, 2016 S.O.S. 45. On the court, Kruger has emerged as a moderate, and is sometimes considered one of the swing votes when the court is occasionally divided. After the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, made a campaign pledge to appoint an African- American woman to the United States Supreme Court, Kruger became the subject of speculation as a future nominee. Personal life Kruger is married to Brian Hauck, a partner at Jenner & Block in Los Angeles, and they have two children.

She previously served as Garda Commissioner from 2014 to 2017. In October 2018, Nóirín was appointed UN Assistant Secretary-General for the Department of Safety and Security. The first woman to lead the Gardaí in its 92-year history, O'Sullivan announced her retirement on 10 September 2017.

In this role she had responsibility for elite, specialist national units such as the Special Detective Unit, Emergency Response Unit and National Surveillance Unit. She became Deputy Commissioner of Operations in 2011 and oversaw some of the most high profile VIP visits to the State. In March 2014, O’Sullivan was appointed interim Commissioner and following an international competition, she was appointed on a permanent basis, by the Government on 25 November 2014, becoming the first female Commissioner to head the force since its foundation in 1922.

She informed Department of Justice secretary general Noel Waters, who spoke to Minister for Justice Charles Flanagan, and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.

The SDP is described in the book Service Design, one of the five books that comprises the core of ITIL. The SDP follows the lifecycle of a service from when it is first suggested as a possibility to when it is finally retired. It is the central reference point for all documentation of a service, so it contains many links to other documents. A description of the sort of information that should be kept in an SDP is found in Appendix A of the Service Design book. The main categories described are: * Service lifecycle plan * Service programme * Service transition plan * Service operational acceptance plan * Overall operational strategy, objectives, policy, risk assessment and plans * Service acceptance criteria At major stages through the life of a service, the \\"Service Design Package (SDP)\\"' will contain project plans, project progress and project outcomes, as well as the business case that justified the service or the transition of the service from one status to another.  Definition of a 'Service'  In the ITIL model, a 'Service' is defined as, \\"A means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve without the ownership of specific costs and risks.\\" The meaning is thus highly business-focused and assumes some degree of outsourcing, although this may just be outsourcing from within the functional business unit to some IT services group within the same overall business. 'Service' in this context should not be confused with the IT meanings of 'service', such as a web service. This is somewhat confused by ITIL also recommending the adoption of service-oriented architecture, as expounded by OASIS. In most technical contexts, SOA is widely assumed to imply the provision and interconnection of technical services. Although a fashionable buzzword for ITIL to have incorporated, they do not use the term according to its general meaning.

He was employed by Morris & Co. and later by James Powell and Sons, before he became a freelance designer, when he continued to undertake commissions for Powell's. His major works include the Lady Chapel windows and the east window of Liverpool Cathedral.  Biography  Brown was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1842, and he trained as an artist under William Bell Scott, a friend of William Morris. In the late 1860s he moved to London and worked with Morris & Co. In 1874 he joined James Powell and Sons where he became a stained glass designer. He was also a painter whose works were in the style of the Aesthetic movement. Brown left Powell's in 1886 to work freelance, but he continued to be their preferred designer for important projects. He continued to produce designs for Powell's up to 1923, but in the later part of his career most of his work was carried out for Henry Holiday. Towards the end of his life his eyesight deteriorated, and he died in 1928.  Works  One of the 'Noble Women' windows = Liverpool Cathedral = In 1907 the competition to design the first stained glass windows for Liverpool Cathedral was won by Powell's, and Brown was commissioned to design them. The first part of the cathedral to be built was the Lady Chapel and, as the chapel was dedicated to St Mary, the designs reflect the part that women have played in the history of Christianity. On the staircase leading from the chapel to the main body of the cathedral are windows known as the 'Noble Women' windows that honour the contribution of women to society. In 1921 Brown went on to design the large east window of the cathedral, which rises above its reredos. The design of the window is based on the theme of the Te Deum laudamus, with the risen Christ at the top, and below are four windows each representing one of the communities praising God. = Elsewhere = Other designs by Brown in Northwest England include windows in Chester Cathedral (1921) and its Refectory (c. 1913), and opus sectile panels in Blackburn Museum and Art Gallery. He also designed windows in churches in Sussex.

She picked up a total of thirty medals in her career, including three from the Pan American Games (1995, 1999, and 2007), and a bronze from the 1995 World Judo Championships in Chiba, Japan, and also appeared in the 57-kg class in two editions of the Olympic Games (1996 and 2004). Growing up in Santos, Zangrando took up judo at the age of 5 following her brother to the dojo of sensei Paulo Duarte. Throughout most of her sporting career, Zangrando trained under Duarte as a full-fledged member of the judo squad for Santos FC Judô. As a 16-year-old neophyte to the sport, Zangrando reached the pinnacle of her judo career at the 1995 World Judo Championships in Chiba, Japan, where she became the first ever Brazilian female to pick up a bronze medal in the lightweight category. Zangrando's remarkable result marked her official debut on the Brazilian team to compete in the same division at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Being inexperienced to the senior stint, Zangrando succumbed her opening match to an ippon and a tsurikomi goshi (lifting and pulling hip throw) assault from Hungary's Maria Pekli. She managed to collect another bronze in the 57-kg division at the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, but missed a chance to campaign for her 2000 Olympic bid due to spinal disc herniation, nearly reaching her early retirement from judo. Coming out of temporary halt, Zangrando paved her stretch to qualify for her second Brazilian judo squad, as a 25-year-old, in the women's lightweight class (57 kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. She placed first in her own division from the Pan American Judo Championships in Margarita Island, Venezuela to guarantee her spot on the Brazilian team for the first time in eight years. Zangrando got off to a firm start with an effortless victory over China's Liu Yuxiang, before falling short in the quarterfinals by an ippon and an uchi mata (inner thigh throw) from Dutch judoka Deborah Gravenstijn. In the repechage round, Zangrando lost to Italy's Cinzia Cavazzuti on a thirteen- second waza-ari tiebreaker after she received a yuko and conceded with only three shido penalties over her opponent by four, resulting to her elimination from the tournament. When her country Brazil hosted the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Zangrando overpowered U.S. judoka Valerie Gotay to claim her first and only career gold in the 57-kg division by the enchantment of her home crowd. Although she decided not to pursue her third Olympic bid, Zangrando added a silver to her career hardware in the same category at the 2009 Pan American Judo Championships in Buenos Aires, Argentina, losing the final to Cuba's Yurisleydis Lupetey. The following year, Zangrando officially announced her retirement from the sport. Zangrando was already in law school when ESPN Brasil invited her to comment on the judo tournament for the 2000 Summer Olympics. The experience made Zangrando interested in studying journalism following her law degree. Following her graduation, Zangrando has been a sports reporter for Terra Networks, Rede Globo and ESPN.

It is native to the tropics of Central America where its typical habitat is wet tropical forests or seasonally dry forests with a dry season of four to seven months, when it may become deciduous. This tree grows to about and has pinnate compound leaves and flowers with a boss of prominent reddish-purple stamens. It is not very drought-tolerant and the above-ground parts are short-lived but the roots regularly resprout. It is a multipurpose legume tree that can improve the soil by fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere. It is easily grown from seed; growth is slow at first but speeds up after the first year. It is used for reforestation, provides soil stabilisation on sloping sites, and provides useful high quality fodder for livestock. It can be regularly coppiced to provide firewood. Because of these features, it has been planted in other parts of the tropics, but care has to be taken that it does not become an invasive species. Basic information Calliandra calothyrsus is a small tree or a large shrub.http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/pdf/outputs/forestry/cfr71_calliandra.pdf (29.11.2014) It is usually 4–6 m high but might reach a height of 12 m under favourable conditions. The stems are quite small with a maximum base diameter of about 30 cm, the bark is blackish- brown.http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/AGPC/doc/Gbase/data/pf000470.htm (29.11.2014) The canopy is dense with alternate, petiolate, bipinnately compound leaves of 10–28 cm lengths, which are folding together at night. Calliandra calothyrsus has both superficial and deep-growing roots. While the above-ground parts are only short lived, the roots are able to sprout up to 20 years. The flowers are subterminal inflorescences with numerous long, hair-like purple or red stamens. Flowering starts 3–6 months after planting. The fruits consist of pods (8–11 cm long and 12 mm wide) that contain 3-15 seeds. Seeds mature 2 months after pollination and can be planted immediately as they have no dormancy period. =Systematics= The genus Calliandra belongs to the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae), subfamily Mimosoideae and tribe Ingae. Calliandra is a large genus with about 145 species, mainly from South and North America but also from Madagascar, India and Africa.http://www.nzdl.org/gsdlmod?e=d-00000-00---off-0hdl--00-0----0-10-0---0 ---0direct-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-help--- 00-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00-0-0-11-10-0utfZz-8-00&a;=d&c;=hdl&cl;=CL3.58&d;=HASH01c80496ecbd184652a2bf98.3 (29.11.2014) Calliandra calothyrsus is one of seven species in a subgroup of the genus, the Racemose. Calliandra calothyrsus was described by Meissner (1848). The names Calliandra confusa and Calliandra similis can be used synonymously.http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPC/doc/publicat/gutt- shel/x5556e09.htm (29.11.2014) =Origin and regions of cultivation= Calliandra callothyrsus is native to the humid and sub-humid areas of Central America and Mexico. There it can be fround from the western Pacific coast of Mexico to Panama.http://www.tropicalforages.info/key/Forages/Media/Html/Calliandra_calothyrsus.htm (17.11.14) But people most probably haven’t been cultivating or studying it there. Calliandra has been introduced to Java in 1936 and spread from there over the Indonesian Archipelago and to other parts of southeast Asia. Nowadays it can also be found in other parts of the tropics, mainly in Uganda, Rwanda and other parts of east Africa as well as in Australia, Hawaii, Brazil and Bolivia. =Environmental requirements= Temperature and altitude Calliandra calothyrsus grows in regions with mean monthly minimum temperatures of 18-24 °C and mean monthly maximum temperatures of 24-28 °C. It can be found in a wide range of altitudes but seems to grow best at altitudes of 250–1300 m asl. However it can naturally reach an altitude of 1800 m asl in Guatemala and even grows well if planted at 2000 m asl as it was done in Indonesia and Kenya. At these altitudes Calliandra calothyrsus has quite some cool tolerance for a tropical species but it is not tolerant to frost. Precipitation Calliandra calothyrsus tolerates annual rainfalls of 700–4000 mm.http://projects.nri.org/biomass/conference_papers/calliandra_calothrysus.pdf It usually grows in wet tropical forests or in seasonally dry forests with a dry season of 4–7 months. Calliandra calothyrsus is not very drought tolerant and will die back under severe droughts. However it is recovering in most cases after the onset of the rainy season. Calliandra calothyrsus is semi- deciduous in regions with long dry seasons whereas it is evergreen in humid climates. Soil Calliandra calothyrsus is adapted to different types of soils. The best growing conditions are on light textured, slightly acidic soils but it is also well adapted to acidic soils with poor soil fertility and is able to grow on infertile and compacted soils.http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb/AFTPDFS/Calliandra_calothyrsus.pdf (25.11.2014) Production =Seed production= The seed production is during the dry season from June to September. After collecting, drying and storing of the seeds they can germinate without treatment, but a quicker germination is achieved by soaking the seeds in cold water for 48 hours. The seeds could be stored for 1–2 years,http://www.infonet- biovision.org/default/ct/734/agroforestry (25.11.2014) but since Calliandra calothyrsus sets fruits continuously there is no need to store. =Nursery practices= Otherwise seedlings can be produced by sowing seeds in a nursery bed and allowing them to grow until they are 20 to 50 cm high with a root collar diameter of 0.5 to 1.0 cm. At this stage they can be replanted. Another method is to produce stumps. In this case the seedlings can grow for four months until they reach a height of 75 to 100 cm subsequently they are top- and root-pruned to about 30 to 20 cm. Stumps are very useful for interplanting among other trees or for a better establishment on steep slopes. =Cultivation= Plantation of Calliandra calothyrsus can be either done by direct seeding or by seedlings. For direct seeding the rows should be free of weeds and the ground should be roughly cultivated. The seeds should be sown at 1 to 3 cm depth. In case of planting seedlings the complete area or at least strips or spots have to be cleared. Plantation of seedlings is done at the beginning of the rainy season and an initial treatment of fertilizer can have a positive effect on the seedlings. The early growth is slow but after the mycorrhizal infection the plant grows up to 3.5m in 6 months. Because of the slow early growth weeding is necessary in the first year but afterwards the canopy closes and weed is no longer problematic. Within the first year Calliandra flowers and bears fruits and after 12 months the plants can be 3 to 5 m tall and 5 cm in diameter at stump height. At this stage the plant has the optimal size for the use of firewood. Harvesting is done at the end of the dry season and for a faster resprounting the cutting is done 20 to 50 cm above the ground. =Pests and diseases= Only minor damages are caused by pests on Calliandra calothyrsus. Seedlings might be attacked by the teak sapling borer (Sahyadrassus malabaricus). Further Pachnoda ephippiata might feed on flowers, fruits and foliage, what causes floral abortion and poor seed production. Fungal attacks can cause serious damages on Calliandra calothyrsus when the plants are cut back too low prior to rainfall or during the wet season.http://www.nzdl.org/gsdlmod?e=d-00000-00---off-0hdl--00-0----0-10-0---0 ---0direct-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-help--- 00-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&a;=d&cl;=CL3.58&d;=HASH01c80496ecbd184652a2bf98.8 (29.11.2014) Product and uses =Soil improvement= Calliandra calothyrsus is a small legume tree able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere,National Research Council (U.S.), Advisory Committee on Technology Innovations, Perhum Perhutani, Indonesia (1983): Calliandra, a Versatile Small Tree for the Humid Tropics which has a positive effect on the nitrogen content in the soil.http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPC/doc/publicat/gutt-shel/x5556e09.htm (17.11.14) Calliandra calothyrsus can be used in crop rotation with sugar cane or with other crops.https://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/Calliandra_calothyrsus.html (17.11.14) Calliandra calothyrsus is used for example as stake for other crop species, such as climbing beans.Nyeko et al (2004). “Farmer’s experiences in the management and utilisation of Calliandra calothyrsus, a fodder shrup in Uganda” Calliandra calothyrsus also provides shade for seedlings of plantations species, like damar (Agathis loranthifolia) for example. =Reforestation= Calliandra calothyrsus is a fast growing tree that has a potential for reforestation in the Tropics. It can be aerially seeded to afforest inaccessible mountainous areas.Heuzé V., Tran G., Doreau M., Lebas F., 2017. Calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/586 It prevents soil erosion encountered in deforested areas. Its rooting system is composed by deep roots as well as numerous lateral roots that enhance a good soil structure. =Animal fodder= Calliandra leaves, pods and young shoots provide a high valuable protein source for animals. It is already used widely in the Tropics: in Indonesia for example for the dairy cattle. Normal supplementation rate of Calliandra calothyrsus is around 20-40%. In Uganda, Calliandra calothyrsus is mostly mixed with other fodder for cows (grasses, tree species…). Calliandra calothyrsus leaves do not contain any toxic compounds but high condensed tannins concentrations, which could limit the digestibility for ruminants. It has been shown that moderate condensed tannin concentrations (2-4% dry matter) can enhance the protein metabolism for ruminants.Rakhmani et al. (2005) “Composition of condensed tannins from Calliandra calothyrsus and correlation with in sacco digestibility” However, high tannin levels up to 11% have a negative effect on the digestibility mechanisms. Monogastric animals seem to have more problems to metabolize the amount of tannins in Calliandra calothyrsus. Calliandra calothyrsus should not be used in grazing regions only, because the risk that animals destroy the tree bark is high, which leads to a high tree mortality. Animals should eat freshly cut Calliandra leaves that were cut between 0 and 1 meter. Apparently, dry leaves seem to be less palatable to animals. Some beneficial effects of using Calliandra calothyrsus as fodder have been observed in Uganda, where farmers noticed an increase in milk production. It is a cheap fodder that also increases production and fat content of milk. The crude protein content is 20-25% of dry matter. Calliandra calothyrsus has a yield of 7-10 t/ha/year of dry matter in Indonesia. =Firewood= Calliandra calothyrsus is a valuable wood source to poor populations that still rely on firewood as energy source. Its fast growing rate enables a quick fuelwood production. The drying process is faster because Calliandra calothyrsus has already lower moisture content (9-12%) than other tree species (13,5%). The wood can already be used after 6 days. Its calorific value is around 4720 kcal/kg. The yield is long-term high: Calliandra calothyrsus can be harvested during 10 to 20 years. Perspectives Calliandra calothyrsus might have a huge potential use in the Tropics which are the regions where problems linked to agricultural products are growing. As most of the tropical soils are losing their fertility, planting Calliandra calothyrsus is a way to improve soil fertility and stabilize the soil structure. Agricultural systems such as intercropping with Calliandra calothyrsus are promising and are a way to deal with deforestation issues. Despite all its benefits, Calliandra calothyrsus could become an invasive plant if it’s not well managed. Moreover, pest and diseases have recently started to appear in East Africa. Nevertheless, Calliandra calothyrsus has a promising future in the Tropics.

Her works are most well known for their critical viewpoint on the Indian women's movement and cultural theory. Activism In 1978 she helped to found Sthri Shakti Sangatana (SSS-Women Power Organization), an organization whose main focus was women. The group consisted of women active in the Maoist Party. Through this organization, Tharu helped to stop the vegetable export which affected housewives, vegetable vendors, and middle-class women. The organization also has raised question about the Rape Law through a series of street performances and public campaigns. Later, Tharu helped to found Anveshi Research Centre for Women's Studies. The organization was founded after SSS, when the ambitions of that organization grew too large for her. The organization was grown from the members of SSS and many still retain membership in both. The new organization, Anveshi, is based on research, critical reflection, and activism surrounding our current historical moment. The organization looks to explore feminist theory and ways of understanding issues in education, Dalits and minorities, development studies, health and healthcare systems, legal studies, and the public domain. The centre is located in Hyderabad, India. Tharu has expressed that Anveshi is very interested in connecting feminist thinking and other thinking, as well as exploring why feminism does not easily invite Muslim or Dalit women. This organization also does a large number of translations of Women's writing in India.

A halfback, Greene represented Waikato at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, in 1976 and 1977. He played eight games for the All Blacks but did not appear in any test matches. Greene was the coach of Waikato before finding himself in Scotland coaching amateur side Glasgow Academicals. During this time he also helped out coaching with Glasgow Academy, Greenock Wanderers and Clydebank Rugby Club. He was to take charge of the fledgling professional side Glasgow Rugby, now Glasgow Warriors, as head coach. This was a dual role with his coaching of Glasgow Academicals. During his time managing Glasgow they entered the Heineken Cup for the first time in the 1997–98 season. Glasgow qualified out of the group stage but lost to Leicester in the quarterfinals, 19 points to 90 points. The dual coaching role that Greene had between Glasgow Academicals and the professional side Glasgow Rugby caused friction with other amateur clubs. It was announced prior to the European Cup quarter final match that Greene would leave the Glasgow Rugby post after the Leicester match and that Keith Robertson would take over the Glasgow side in November 1997. In Super Rugby, he was assistant coach of the in 2001, and coach in 2002 and 2003. Glasgow's flyhalf Calum MacGregor once gave this tribute of his boss: \\"Kevin Greene, the Glasgow coach, is the kind of man who makes the players think for themselves, like Ian McGeechan, and I prefer that to the blood-and-thunder approach. I have enjoyed playing for Glasgow this year more than any other. I look around at the young guys in the team and they are keen and excited and that makes me feel good about the game. The players have a belief in it and a desire to win and I like that.\\" Greene was noted for his eye for detail in coaching. He would even change the way players ran: 'He demands they run upright, elbows in to the waist, when they give and take the ball, and they are to pass high. The reason? An upright player doesn't need to break his stride pattern as he receives a ball, unlike one that has been taught to give and take a ball at waist height and whose hands will interfere with his lifting knees. And the eyes can remain on the opposition.' Even when leaving Glasgow to go home to New Zealand he still remained helpful to the Scottish professional side. He was to organise a training trip to New Zealand for the Glasgow Thistles; 22 players in the Glasgow District's age grades. Included in the 22 were Euan Murray and current Warriors development coach Iain Monaghan.

His term included the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 which effectively heralded the end, in 1990, of the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet government played a key role in this process. Life and career Kochemasov became a member of the Communist Party in 1942. Directly after the end of World War II he became an official in the international section of the Young Communist League (Komsomol). After that, between 1955 and 1960, he worked at the Soviet Embassy in East Berlin. From 1966 till 1983 he was deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers for the Russian Federation. At the same time he held leadership positions in the \\"All- union society for protecting Culture and Historical Monuments\\" and with the Rossotrudnichestvo.Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States, Compatriots Living Abroad and International Humanitarian Cooperation/Федеральное агентство по делам Содружества Независимых Государств, соотечественников, проживающих за рубежом, и по международному гуманитарному сотрудничеству Between 1966 and 1983 he was listed as a candidate for membership of the Central Committee: between June 1983 and June 1990 he was a full member of it. In 1983 Yuri Andropov, the new Soviet leader, appointed Kochemasov to succeed Peter Abrassimov as Soviet Ambassador to East Germany. In 1985 a new generation took over at the Kremlin as Mikhail Gorbachev became Soviet Party Secretary in March 1985. Gorbachev took a substantially changed approach to relations between Moscow and East Berlin, but Vyacheslav Kochemasov nevertheless remained in his ambassadorial post for more than five of the Perestroika-Glasnost years that ensued. During the evening of 9 November 1989, as The Berlin Wall came down, there was widespread speculation as to how the Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic might react. Vyacheslav Kochemasov did nothing. It was later reported that on the evening of 9 November, he had tried, without success, to telephone Mikhail Gorbachev and then the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, for instructions. During the reunification process Kochemasov continued to represent his country's interests. In this connection it was Kochemasov who on 16 April 1990 handed over to East Germany's recently elected prime minister, Lothar de Maizière, the so-called \\"Non-paper\\" which set out, unofficially and in an informal manner, the Soviet Union's eleven ground-rules for the rapidly unfolding reunification of East and West Germany. The note recorded that Article 23 of the East German constitution clearly rejected a union of the two German states and also rejected membership of NATO for a reunited Germany. At the beginning of June 1990 Vyacheslav Kochemasov, now aged nearly 72, was recalled to Moscow and entered into retirement. His successor as Soviet Ambassador to East Germany was Gennadi Schikin. Kochemasov died in 1998 in Moscow. He is buried, with his wife Ziniaida Nicolaevna, a highly qualified medical doctor, in the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery on the western edge of Moscow., The ambassador's insights =On tensions in East German government during the Perestroika years= The extent to which East Germany's leader Erich Honecker and his inner circle felt unsettled and undermined by on-going Perestroika in the Soviet Union became more widely known after Honecker himself had retired. In 1992 Kochemasov gave a remarkable interview to the western press, disclosing that as far back as 1986 a senior member of the East German government, Werner Krolikowski had told him, in confidence, that the situation in the country's SED Politburo had become \\"unbearable\\": policy decisions were totally driven by dogma, there was no longer any discussion, there was an absurd level of centralisation and an utterly implausible communications strategy. Something must be done: the leader must be replaced. =On the limitations imposed on a Warsaw bloc leader's autonomy by the Brezhnev Doctrine= The year before he died Kochemasov gave another western press interview in which he concentrated on the events of November 1989 and their aftermath. He confirmed that the Brezhnev Doctrine had left an East German head of state with surprisingly little autonomy. He recalled that he had been invited to interpret an instruction from Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that long running demonstrations in Leipzig should be brought under control, regardless of how it was done. The East German leader Erich Honecker and his successor Egon Krenz were unable to agree whether Gorbachev's instruction amounted to a mandate to suppress the Leipzig demonstration using force. Kochemasov, representing the Soviet viewpoint had immediately supported the Krenz interpretation that force should on no account be used against the Leipzig demonstrators. He had also, for the avoidance of any doubt, then lost no time in communicating the same interpretation to Soviet army commanders based in East Germany. =On the Gorbachev strategy over East Germany= The same interview included discussion on whether prosecuting of the country's former leaders for the killings of people trying to escape from East Germany represented a treaty breach by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Kochemasov believed that court actions against former East German leaders represented a breach of a gentlemen's agreement between Kohl and Gorbachev, implying that Gorbachev had been too trusting in his dealings with the West German leader. But as far as Kochemasov knew there had been no express treaty provision or other documented agreement covering the issue. At the end of the interview, when pushed for an opinion, Kochemasov confirmed that in terms of the fundamental interests of the Soviet Union, he believed that Gorbachev had shown excessive and unnecessary weakness over German reunification.

Background Sydney Construction purchased a 3-acre block of land in Mt Albert, with the intention of a residential development. At the time of the sale, the seller had informed Sydney that there was rubbish buried in the land. Sydney subsequently subdivided the land, and built numerous houses there. On the section that Johnson ultimately purchased, six flats were constructed in 1967. In 1970, Johnson purchased the flat, and within the year she had noticed subsidence in the building, and as a result she got an engineer to do an inspection. The engineer did some test drilling, and discovered amongst other rubbish, gib board and motor vehicle parts buried in the foundation, requiring 20 steel poles to be drilled to rectify the subsidence. Johnson in 1973 sued the council for negligently approving the building permit. Then council filed for Sydney Construction to be made a third party, which Johnson later applied to have Sydney listed as a codefendant. The High Court awarded Johnson $10,000 in damages. The Council appealed. Held The court dismissed the appeal.

Facts Richard Lester wrote a testament to devise a house to the eldest son of his nephew, Randal Minshull, and in default other male heirs (the eldest was another Randal, the second John). It said: There was also a provision that whoever inherited should pay other brothers and sisters £20 a piece. Randal died without children. It passed to John, who gave the property to his youngest son, instead of his eldest son. The question was whether this was allowed, or the will had meant the second son of the second Randall Minshull (i.e. not Richard Lester's nephew, but Richard Lester's nephew's son). Those potential inheritors were claiming for rents. Judgment Lord Hardwicke LC held that the will was valid, and on the true construction, the property was to pass to John's sons. Significance *Robinson v Robinson (1756) 96 ER 999, Lord Mansfield took over the case upon Ryder CJ's death, and held a will valid, \\"to effectuate the manifest general intent of the testator\\".

ZigTech debuted in January 2010 and was first introduced with the ZigPulse later that year. ZigTech includes a zigzag foam sole that is designed to push athletes forward. The design assists in energy return to the wearer by absorbing impact at the heel and dispersing the energy through the zigzag composition which propels the athlete forward and also reduces stress on the shins. Reebok has released various styles of ZigTech designs that are compatible across a variety of sports. Product history The first shoe debuted with the Reebok ZigTech design was the ZigPulse, which was released in March 2010 in six colorways. The shoe was lightweight, flexible and made for runners and athletes. In June 2010, Reebok announced the release of Zig Slash. ZigSlash was designed as the signature shoe of professional basketball player John Wall, the 2010 NBA draft first pick and point guard for the Washington Wizards. Styles Reebok has released other collections and styles with the brand's Zig technology since the two introductory styles in 2010. In Spring 2011, Reebok debuted the next ZigTech shoe, the ZigTech Nano Fly. The shoes were designed as a lower-profile version of the original lightweight running shoe. Later in 2011, the brand introduced ZigWild TR running shoes that were modified with spikes placed between the \\"zigs\\" on the sole, along with a reinforced nylon upper. The shoes were released in six colorways and designed to create more traction for trail running. In 2012, the ZigLite Run shoes debuted as a more flexible, better-cushioned running shoe with Zig 2.0 technology. The shoes were originally released in NHL inspired colorways and later in neutral tones. ZigTech Sharks were also introduced in 2012. The shoes had redesigned zigzag soles with 20-degree backward angles that resembled shark teeth. ZigKicks were also released and had an arched soles to improve stride. The Zig Carbon shoes debuted in 2013 reinforced with a carbon plate running from the heel to the ball of the foot. The following year, ZigTech Big 'N Fast high-performance running shoes were introduced.

The romance and drama novel, released on 25 November 2014 through Penguin Books, is aimed at a teen audience and focuses on a fifteen-year-old anonymous blogger and what happens when her blog goes viral. The novel is a New York Times Best Seller in the Young Adult category. The book was the fastest selling book of 2014 and it broke the record for highest first-week sales for a debut author since records began. Plot The novel surrounds Penny Porter, a 15 year old living with her parents in Brighton. Penny starts blogging about her problems, such as school drama, friends, family, boys and the panic attacks she has been having. When things in her life go from bad to worse her family travels to New York City where her mother is organizing a wedding. Attending the wedding, Penny meets a musician, Noah, with whom she falls in love, resulting in her blog going viral. Penny then faces some unexpected challenges. Background While based around similar experiences, Sugg has stated that the book is \\"in no way autobiographical\\". The book was listed before release by pop culture website ANDPOP as one of \\"10 Books by Celebrities that are Worth Reading\\". =Authorship= Penguin stated that \\"Sugg did not write Girl Online on her own\\", stating that she \\"has worked with an expert editorial team to help her bring to life her characters and experiences in a heartwarming and compelling story\\". It has been reported that young-adult novelist Siobhan Curham was a ghostwriter for the novel, although this has not been confirmed by Sugg, Curham, or Penguin. Penguin stated that Curham was an \\"editorial consultant\\" for the novel. Publication history Girl Online was officially released on 25 November 2014, though Penguin stated that due to high demand \\"every bookseller broke the embargo on its sale\\" before this date. The book was in the amazon.co.uk \\"Top 100 Best Seller\\" list for 67 days prior to release, reaching third position, based on pre-sales alone. The novel entered The New York Times Best Seller list for young adult fiction in position 9 for the week ending 14 December, dropping to 13 the following week. Sugg went on a book signing tour in the UK to promote the release of the novel. The sessions were held at secret locations and ticketed for health and safety concerns, due to the exceptional demand. The UK and US covers feature different images provided by Sugg's fans, selected via a competition hosted on Instagram. =Release= Girl Online broke the record for the highest ever first-week sales for a debut author since records began in 1998, selling a total of 78,109 copies, making it the fastest selling book of 2014. 343,562 copies have been sold. * 2014, UK, Penguin Books , pub date 25 Nov 2014, Hardback * 2014, USA, Atria , pub date 25 Nov 2014, Hardback * 2014, Penguin Books, pub date 25 Nov 2014, Audiobook =Sequel= A sequel entitled Girl Online: On Tour was released on 20 October 2015. =Third book= A third book, Girl Online: Going Solo was confirmed by Sugg on 8 July 2016 and published on 17 November 2016. Reception Girl Online received a mixed review from Anita Singh for The Daily Telegraph, who awarded it a score of three out of five. Singh found the romance to be unrealistic and stated that \\"the teenagers in this book bear no resemblance to any I have ever met\\", while also acknowledging that she is \\"not Zoella's target market\\" and that \\"times must have changed\\". She further states that while the book itself is \\"sugary as a frosted cupcake\\", \\"so is Zoella and six million YouTube subscribers love her that way\\" and that \\"Sugg has tapped into a truth\\"; \\"growing up doesn't have to mean leaving childish stuff behind.\\" The novel was well received by Daisy Wyatt, for The Independent, who found the novel \\"difficult to fault\\", calling it \\"fun and easy to relate to, while also having a positive message\\". Wyatt found, however, that \\"while Girl Online does teach sound advice to teenagers about being cautious of their online activity\\", Sugg has \\"found fame and fortune in sharing personal details on the internet\\" and felt that her fans are more likely to copy her than the fictional Penny. The novel was well received in The Guardian with reviewer 'lilybelle' stating \\"I could relate so much to everything\\" and that \\"This book inspired me... I literally feel as though I've changed overnight\\". She also found that Sugg \\"made Penny a bit too similar to herself\\", making it \\"confusing at times\\", but described the novel overall as \\"special and inspiring.\\" Shorty after release, Sugg faced huge backlash after it emerged that Girl Online was ghostwritten.https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/zoella-theres- nothing-wrong-with-hiring-a-ghost-writer-as-long-as-you-admit-it-9910453.html References Category:2014 British novels Category:Novels by Zoe Sugg Category:Novels set in London Category:Novels set in New York (state) Category:Penguin Books books Category:British young adult novels Category:Novels about the Internet Category:Books by YouTubers Category:2014 debut novels ","title":"Girl Online"},{"id":"44515890","text":"Ramin Toloui Tehrani or Ramin Toloui () is an American academic, civil servant, and financial advisor.

Early life and career  Born in November 1960, Fankhauser has a doctorate from the University of St. Gallen in political science. He was responsible for managing the European division of the tourism company Kuoni and worked for the leisure airline LTU in Germany.  Thomas Cook Group  Fankhauser joined Thomas Cook Group in 2001. He was promoted to chief operating officer in November 2013. In November 2014, it was announced that Harriet Green was to leave Thomas Cook Group with immediate effect, and that Fankhauser would take over as CEO. Fankhauser received £8.3 million worth of pay since becoming CEO, including a £2.9 million bonus in 2015. During that year, he faced criticism of how Thomas Cook handled the deaths of two children whilst on holiday in Corfu. He admitted that Thomas Cook \\"failed to show compassion\\" following calls to boycott the company over its behaviour. Thomas Cook was subject to widespread speculation about its financial position throughout 2019. By September the company had secured £900 million in funding as part of a debt-for-equity swap, including a £450 million investment from Chinese travel group Fosun International. Despite this, a late demand emerged from funders of the Group including Royal Bank of Scotland Group and Halifax, who insisted that the Group be sufficiently recapitalised to ensure operations were protected through to January, when bookings are traditionally quieter and liquidity would be challenging. This demand meant the group needed an extra £200 million of funding to keep the company operational. These efforts did not succeed, with the UK Government Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps stating that they would not step in to provide financial support, instead stating it would only support the Civil Aviation Authority response to any bankruptcy, which he said was \\"on track so far\\" and \\"running smoothly\\". Media reports indicated that a group including the Turkish government and a group of Spanish hoteliers backed by Spanish ministers had offered financial support in order to assist their domestic industries, but that the rescue had failed because \\"the British government said it was not prepared to provide any financial guarantees to underpin the funding package.\\" In the morning of 23 September the company declared bankruptcy and entered compulsory liquidation, which took effect at all Thomas Cook Group UK companies. Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia temporarily ceased operations, while other sister companies suspended or continued operations, depending on their corporate relationship. The liquidation left 150,000 British tourists in need of repatriation, the largest such case in British history, ahead of the 2017 collapse of Monarch Airlines. Fankhauser apologised to colleagues and customers for the \\"deeply sad day\\", but blamed banks for its collapse stating that \\"an additional facility requested in the last few days of negotiations presented a challenge that ultimately proved insurmountable.\\" Hedge funds have also been noted as major beneficiaries of the events, with \\"Thomas Cook the most shorted company on the London Stock Exchange\\" prior to the collapse. On 15 October 2019 Fankhauser was questioned by a cross-party committee of MPs over the collapse of Thomas Cook. Committee chair Rachel Reeves, who asked Fankhauser if he would hand the bonus back, told him that his apologies rang \\"rather hollow\\".

The conference never fully utilized the bandwidth; maximum bandwidth use was approximately 200 Mbit/s. The main political topic of the conference was the fight against the DMCA and similar anti-hacker legislation under way in Europe.http://www.securityfocus.com/news/234 The name HAL was primarily derived from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which HAL is the name of the ship's artificial intelligence. This name was backronymed Hackers At Large. The conference was held primarily outdoors. Logistically speaking, the network structure was quite a feat, with approximately 15 km of category 5 cable for the ethernet backbones, as well as supplying power feeds for the tents' computers. There was a technology-free zone, The Solaris Sl@ckers S@lon, named for the 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky, which is often thought to be the Russian answer to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The only technology permitted in the place was a television, a DVD player running the movie, and a Turkish (electric) samovar for brewing tea.

History Alpha Epsilon Rho is commonly known as NBS, AERho, or NBS-AERho. The society was founded as a local recognition group for students interested in radio technology called Beta Epsilon Phi at Stephens College on December 1, 1941. With interest in national expansion the Stephens students reached out to similarly-inclined students at other institutions for a series of meetings, including representatives from Syracuse University and the University of Minnesota, held at the Institute for Education by Radio, in Columbus, Ohio. The young organization adopted the name of Alpha Epsilon Rho on 30 April 1943, which it considers its founding date. In 1975 the organization became The National Broadcasting Society - Alpha Epsilon Rho, and changed itself from a recognition society into a professional society. As a unit of the NBS, Alpha Epsilon Rho would later became an honor society. Alpha Epsilon Rho was admitted to the Association of College Honor Societies in 2009. Several grades of membership are available. The Society explains that AERho membership is inter-related but separate from NBS membership, consisting of those students who achieve the required scholastic and participatory requirements.

The OCSiAl headquarter is located in Luxembourg, with offices in the US, Russia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Australia and Germany, with a team of over 450 employees. Technology The synthesis technology used by OCSiAl for graphene nanotubes (also known as single wall carbon nanotubes – SWCNT) is based on research by one of the company's founders, Mikhail Predtechensky, OCSiAl's Chief Technology Officer and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The technology is notable for producing SWCNT in tonnes to enable low enough pricing for industrial applications to become economically feasible. The company's initial synthesis facility, named Graphetron 1.0, was built at the company's scientific and prototyping center in Akademgorodok, Novosibirsk. The first industrial-scale batch of graphene nanotubes – 1.2 tonnes – was synthesized by OCSiAl in 2015, which at the time exceeded the entire volume of this material ever produced since its discovery in 1991. In February 2020, OCSiAl announced the launch of its second synthesis facility, named Graphetron 50, with a production capacity of 50 tonnes of grahene nanotubes per year. The Graphetron 50 facility is currently the world’s largest plant for graphene nanotube production and increases OCSiAl’s production capacity to 75 tonnes per year. In 2017, together with Luxembourg's Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Finance, OCSiAl signed a Memorandum of Understanding to construct a graphene nanotube factory in the Grand Duchy. The commissioning of the first production line with an annual capacity of up to 100 tonnes per year is scheduled for 2023. History In December 2014, Frost & Sullivan recognized the OCSiAl Group with its 2014 North American Award for Technology Innovation for OCSiAl's TUBALL SWCNT products. The award was given for the high purity and large-scale production capability of TUBALL products, which has significantly increased the commercialization potential of single wall carbon nanotube products. In 2015, the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), a United States government program to accelerate nanotechnology commercialization, recognized OCSiAl for expanding its matching grant program (iNanoComm) for exploratory research with SWCNT. In September 2016, OCSiAl registered its core product TUBALL through the EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation under the number 01-2120130006-75-0000. As of November 2016, OCSiAl is the only company with the license toproduce and commercialize up to 10 tonnes of nanotubes in Europe annually. In 2019, OCSiAl was added to the list of unicorn startup companies,a list of startup companies valued at $1 billion or more, according to CB Insights and Techcrunch. Products The company's core product is TUBALL, high-purity graphene nanotubes that can be used as a universal additive for a wide range of materials. Graphene nanotube is an extremely thin rolled-up sheet of graphene. The key advantage of graphene nanotubes centers around the very low loadings, starting at 0.01%, that are sufficient for achieving uniform and permanent conductivity while also reinforcing mechanical properties. The very low loadings made possible by SWCNT provide the ability to maintain the original color and minimally impact secondary properties of most materials. OCSiAl has also developed nanotube- based concentrates that simplify graphene nanotubes use in various materials. In 2015, the company opened a research facility focused on nanotubes applications for batteries, elastomers, paints and coatings, thermoplastic, and thermoset materials. Applications =Elastomer applications= TUBALL- based masterbatches use rubber polymers, fillers and oil plasticizers as nanotube carriers, allowing performance improvements with minimal changes to the composition of a rubber compound. In October 2016, LANXESS and OCSiAl announced new nanotubes products targeting reinforced and conductive latex rubbers. =Energy storage applications= TUBALL nanotubes bring performance improvements to Li-ion and lead–acid batteries, and to supercapacitors and fuel cells. In these applications SWCNT has the potential to replace carbon black and other carbon-based additives, with a study by Aleees demonstrating 10% higher volumetric energy density and decreasing cathode thickness by 18% in 10 Ah pouch cells. In another study by Aleees, SWCNT-coated foils showed an increase in energy delivered to cells by 0-252%, depending on the discharge rate. In trials of lead-acid batteries 0.001% of SWCNT in the electrode paste increased cycle life and rate capability five-fold. =Paints & coatings applications= TUBALL nanotubes provide conductivity to colored and transparent coatings with minimal impact on color or transparency, while maintaining or increasing mechanical properties. Conductivity may be employed for ESD-control properties or electrostatic painting methods. =Resins & composites applications= In November 2016, OCSiAl announced an agreement with BÜFA Composite Systems in Europe to provide TUBALL nanotubes and TUBALL MATRIX nanotube concentrates for BÜFA-developed resin formulations. In 2017 BÜFA hit the market with its line of conductive gelcoats with colored, smooth and glossy surfaces. There are some particular applications where nanotube- based gelcoats can almost completely replace standard gelcoats. Pipes and tanks for chemicals, ventilation systems, printing rollers, control boxes for electronics, floor coatings at industrial production plants, tooling gelcoats and resins for composites, to name just a few. The companies noted that using graphene nanotubes in composites provides a conductive and reinforcing network at low loadings, enabling conductive parts to retain color and improve mechanical strength.

He was described as \\"competent and versatile\\".A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, H M Colvin Life He was born around 1771, the son of James Crichton (d.1797) an Edinburgh mason. He trained under John and Robert Adam, probably the best training an architect in 18th century Britain could hope for. In May 1797 he was appointed as a burgess in the city of Edinburgh, reflecting the public esteem with which he was viewed. He continued the style of the Adams: a simple but very well-proportioned Classicism, occasionally venturing to the Gothic or Greek Revival styles, all with equal competence. In 1813 he submitted a competition design for the extension of Princes Street over to Calton Hill but despite winning this (jointly with William Reid of Glasgow), the scheme was ultimately executed by Archibald Elliot. Crichton’s career was cut short by his premature death on 17 August 1817, aged only 46.

It was formulated by Linus Pauling in 1948 and later revised.The Nature of the Chemical bond, L. Pauling, 1960, 3d edition, pp. 172-173, 270, 273, 547 Cornell University Press, The principle has been used to predict which of a set of molecular resonance structures would be the most significant, to explain the stability of inorganic complexes and to explain the existence of π-bonding in compounds and polyatomic anions containing silicon, phosphorus or sulfur bonded to oxygen; it is still invoked in the context of coordination complexes.R.H. Crabtree, The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals, 6th edition, John Wiley & Sons, (e-book), However, modern computational techniques indicate many stable compounds have a greater charge distribution than the principle predicts (they contain bonds with greater ionic character). History Pauling first stated his \\"postulate of the essential electroneutrality of atoms\\" in his 1948 Liversidge lecture (in a broad-ranging paper that also included his ideas on the calculation of oxidation states in molecules): :“...the electronic structure of substances is such as to cause each atom to have essentially zero resultant electrical charge, the amount of leeway being not greater than about +/- ½ , and these resultant charges are possessed mainly by the most electropositive and electronegative atoms and are distributed in such a way as to correspond to electrostatic stability.\\" A slightly revised version was published in 1970: :“Stable molecules and crystals have electronic structures such that the electric charge of each atom is close to zero. Close to zero means between -1 and +1.”General Chemistry, Linus Pauling, 1988 p 192, Dover (reprint of 3d edition orig. pub. W.H. Freeman 1970), Pauling said in his Liversidge lecture in 1948 that he had been led to the principle by a consideration of ionic bonding. In the gas phase, molecular caesium fluoride has a polar covalent bond. The large difference in electronegativity gives a calculated covalent character of 9%. In the crystal (CsF has the NaCl structure with both ions being 6-coordinate) if each bond has 9% covalent character the total covalency of Cs and F would be 54%. This would be represented by one bond of around 50% covalent character resonating between the six positions and the overall effect would be to reduce the charge on Cs to about + 0.5 and fluoride to -0.5. It seemed reasonable to him that since CsF is the most ionic of ionic compounds, most, if not all substances will have atoms with even smaller charges. Applications of the principle =Explanation of the structure adopted by hydrogen cyanide= There are two possible structures for hydrogen cyanide, HCN and CNH, differing only as to the position of the hydrogen atom. The structure with hydrogen attached to nitrogen, CNH, leads to formal charges of -1 on carbon and +1 on nitrogen, which would be partially compensated for by the electronegativity of nitrogen and Pauling calculated the net charges on H, N and C as -0.79, +0.75 and +0.04 respectively. In contrast the structure with hydrogen bonded to carbon, HCN, has formal charges on carbon and nitrogen of 0, and the effect of the electronegativity of the nitrogen would make the charges on H, C and N +0.04, +0.17 and -0.21. The triple bonded structure is therefore favored. =Relative contribution of resonance structures (canonicals)= As an example the cyanate ion (OCN)− can be assigned three resonance structures:- :^-O-C{\\\\equiv}N <-> O=C=N^- <-> {^+O{\\\\equiv}C-N^{2-}} The rightmost structure in the diagram has a charge of -2 on the nitrogen atom. Applying the principle of electroneutrality this can be identified as only a minor contributor. Additionally as the most electronegative atom should carry the negative charge, then the triple bonded structure on the left is predicted to be the major contributor.John Kotz, Paul Treichel, John Townsend, David Treichel, 7th Edition, 2009, Chemistry & Chemical Reactivity , pp. 378-379, Thomson Brooks/Cole, =Stability of complexes= The hexammine cobalt(III) complex [Co(NH3)6]3+ would have all of charge on the central Co atom if the bonding to the ammonia molecules were electrostatic. On the other hand, a covalent linkage would lead to a charge of -3 on the metal and +1 on each of the nitrogen atoms in the ammonia molecules. Using the electroneutrality principle the assumption is made that the Co-N bond will have 50% ionic character thus resulting in a zero charge on the cobalt atom. Due to the difference in electronegativity the N-H bond would 17% ionic character and therefore a charge of 0.166 on each of the 18 hydrogen atoms. This essentially spreads the 3+ charge evenly onto the \\"surface\\" of the complex ion. =π-bonding in oxo compounds of Si, P, and S= Pauling invoked the principle of electroneutrality in a 1952 paper to suggest that pi bonding is present, for example, in molecules with 4 Si-O bonds. The oxygen atoms in such molecules would form polar covalent bonds with the silicon atom because their electronegativity (electron withdrawing power) was higher than that of silicon. Pauling calculated the charge build up on the silicon atom due to the difference in electronegativity to be +2. The electroneutrality principle led Pauling to the conclusion that charge transfer from O to Si must occur using d orbitals forming a π-bond and he calculated that this π-bonding accounted for the shortening of the Si-O bond. The adjacent charge rule The \\"adjacent charge rule\\" was another principle of Pauling's for determining whether a resonance structure would make a significant contribution. First published in 1932, it stated that structures that placed charges of the same sign on adjacent atoms would be unfavorable.L Pauling, The Electronic Structure of the Normal Nitrous Oxide Molecule, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 1932, 18, 498 References Category:Chemical bonding Category:Quantum chemistry ","title":"Pauling's principle of electroneutrality"},{"id":"44516011","text":"Muslim Youth Helpline (MYH) is a national helpline in the UK providing free and confidential faith and culturally sensitive support services targeted at vulnerable young people.

He is best known as the author of the 2001 flying memoir Propellerhead, and the 2010 gardening memoir The Garden in the Clouds, an account of moving with his wife and family to a Welsh mountain-top to create an unlikely garden, Tair-Ffynnon, fit to open to the public. Previously, Woodward worked as an advertising copywriter at various London advertising agencies including Collett Dickenson Pearce (CDP).  Early life  Woodward was born in Bristol and grew up in the Mendip Hills in Somerset. His father, Dr Peter Woodward, was an x-ray crystallographer and lecturer in inorganic chemistry at Bristol University. His mother, Dr Elizabeth Davies (granddaughter of Liberal politician Sir William Howell Davies) was a botanical geneticist. Woodward's mother was wheelchair-bound following a riding accident in 1968. It was this fact, according to Woodward, along with growing up in a Modernist house, which drove the craving for wildness he describes in The Garden in the Clouds.  Education  Woodward was educated at Eton and Selwyn College, Cambridge (where he was an Exhibitioner). Aged 28 he went to St Peter's College, Oxford as a postgraduate to study History of Art, also attending Florence University on an Italian Institute scholarship, before completing an MA in Architectural History at the Courtauld Institute of Art in 1993.  Career  From 1986 to 1991 Woodward worked as an advertising copywriter at Mavity Gilmore Jaume, Still Price Court Twivy D'Souza and Collett Dickenson Pearce. After two years as a postgraduate, Woodward returned to copywriting from 1994 to 2001 (Ammirati Puris Lintas, Publicis) while writing his first book. He has also written columns for the Independent on Sunday, Perspectives on Architecture, Tatler and Country Life  Personal life  Woodward had a near-death escape in 1996 when he crashed his microlight aircraft into electricity cables near Lockerbie during the 1996 Round Britain Rally – an event recounted in Propellerhead. Woodward is married to Verity Williams, a former board director of the advertising agency AMV BBDO. They have three children.  Publications  * 2001 – Propellerhead (Harper Collins) * 2007 – The Wrong Kind of Snow: The Complete Daily Companion to the British Weather, with Rob Penn (Hodder & Stoughton. * 2010 – The Garden in the Clouds (Harper Collins) Propellerhead is a bildungsroman cataloguing Woodward's serial misadventures as he attempts to achieve pilot status to facilitate his stated aim of seducing women – one woman in particular, known throughout the book as 'Lift Girl'. In the process he inadvertently becomes obsessed with flying. The Wrong Kind of Snow, co-written with Rob Penn, is a weather almanac doubling as a meteorological history of Britain. 'An idiosyncratic accumulation of strange weather-related factoids, quotes and anecdotes'. 'It is arranged in calendar format, a day to a page, and combines... tales of monster snowfalls... with first-hand accounts and weather-themed quotes from writers and poets.' The Garden in the Clouds recounts Woodward's attempts to connect with the inner countryman he never found as a rural child. This he sets about by first seeking out his 'ultimate rural hideaway' – a cottage on a bleak mountain top – then trying to create a garden there: his way, he says, to ‘consummate’ his relationship with his idyll. The narrative touches on various linked themes: the true impulses behind the desire to garden; the meaning of place; the joys of winter; the human search for paradise – in particular the ‘garden in our heads’ that we all supposedly carry around and which hypnotists like to access to make their subjects relax.  Critical reception.  = Propellerhead = On publication different commentators said the book reminded them of the writings of Redmond O'Hanlon, Roger Deakin, Jonathan Raban and T.H.White. Propellerhead made several best-seller lists and was critically well received. 'What Nick Hornby did for football, Antony Woodward has done for flying ... Wonderful' (Observer). ‘Woodward has a gift for storytelling and comic timing and his acute awareness of the absurdities of maleness make this an impossible book not to like’ (Independent). 'Hugely engaging ... a true love affair, albeit with clouds and air' (Sunday Telegraph). 'A brilliant evocation of the thrill and romance of the sport' (Sunday Express). Propellerhead has remained continuously in print since publication and on its tenth anniversary, in 2011, was described by Pilot magazine as 'one of the best books ever written about flying'. = The Wrong Kind of Snow = 'Endlessly fascinating, written with flair and a feel for the drama of the moment' said the Financial Times. = The Garden in the Clouds = ‘You start to see where all gardeners get their pleasures and compulsions’ – The Times. 'I set out determined to dislike the book, and I completely failed to do so. There can be no higher praise than that.' – The Spectator. The Garden in the Clouds was a winner of the National Trust and Hay Festival Outdoors Books of the Year 2011, was a Book of the Year in The Spectator, The Times and The Tablet and was shortlisted for the Banff Mountain Book Prize.  Garden (Tair-Ffynnon)(The Garden in the Clouds)  In 2007, Tair-Ffynnon, the six-acre smallholding in the Brecon Beacons which became the subject of The Garden in the Clouds, was accepted into The Yellow Book of gardens opening under the National Gardens Scheme for charity. At just over 1,200 feet, Woodward has claimed the garden is the highest in the UK, although this has been disputed. Woodward has cited the influence of Derek Jarman's garden in Dungeness, for its simplicity, sense of place and limited range of local, often wild, plants, herbs and flowers. He has claimed that Tair-Ffynnon is, in his phrase, a ‘not garden’, because conventional garden features such as lawns, beds, shrubs, even plants, deliberately have no place in it. ‘Tair-Ffynnon already was a garden – at least to me. It needed no embellishment. Our “garden” would consist merely of the existing idioms of the hill: the spring, walls, gates, wildflower meadows, stone piles, rusting farm implements. The views and clouds could do the rest.’ The garden’s few ‘features’ are site-specific, hill-top ones: an ‘infinity vegetable patch’; clipped box balls ‘rolling’ down through a wild flower meadow; part of the Anglo-Welsh poet Edward Thomas's ‘The Lofty Sky’ painted onto the wall of a barn facing a take-off point for hang gliders and paragliders. Some commentators have declared the garden ‘non-existent’. In 2011 Tair-Ffynnon featured on ITV's Countrywise (ITV 14 June 2011) and in 2013 the garden was included in the book The Gardens of England: Treasures of the National Gardens Scheme (2013).  Television  In 2011 Woodward was followed for the BBC 'Wonderland' documentary 'The Real Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines'. The programme featured three competing teams as they prepared for and entered the British Microlight Aircraft Association's Round Britain Rally. The event was significant because it was the same rally in which Woodward had crashed so disastrously 15 years earlier and also because it marked the centenary of the original Daily Mail Circuit of Britain Air Race in 1911. Explaining his decision to re-enter the race, aged 48, as a 'routine midlife crisis', the film demonstrated Woodward's extreme incompetence in the air. The film, especially Woodward's definition of a microlight as 'a chainsaw attached to a deckchair', sparked heated debate within the microlighting fraternity between the 'nutters or eccentrics' on one side and the more serious-minded, anxious to demonstrate the credibility of the sport, on the other.

The burial mounds date back to the early Bronze Ages 1800–1000 years B.C.Århus Amts og Naturstyrelsens infostander v. højene These hills are some of the more known view points in Mols Bjerge National Park. Other view points in the area are Agri Baunehøj, Trehøje, Ellemandsbjerg and Jernhatten. View from Stabelhøje, south-west, across Knebel Vig and Aarhus Bay towards Aarhus and the west coast of Jutland. In the early Bronze Ages tribal leaders and other important members of society where buried in mounds placed in coffins made from hollowed out oak tree trunks. According to archaeological findings the burial customs changed during the Bronze Ages from coffin burials in oak trunks to cremation in the late Danish Bronze Ages. Probably due to international influence caused by long-distance trade with commodities such as copper, tin and cattle. This change in burial customs is probably also the case at Stabelhøje, that most likely hold several generations of burials from different Bronze Age time periods. From the top of the mounds there is a view to Kalø Castle Ruin in Egens Bay – part of Aarhus Bay, and to the coast of Jutland, with Aarhus, Denmarks second largest town, in the distance. One can also see the hilly fields of southern Djursland, and the unfarmed hills of protected central Mols, including the tallest hill in the area, Agri Baunehøj, 137 meters above sea level. There is also a view of Ebeltoft Bay, and of the southernmost peninsula on Djursland, Helgenæs. The difference in elevation is accentuated by views that go all the way down to the surface of the sea. Flowering thrift at the top of the southernmost Stabelhøje. The vegetation on mounds can be special and varied, caused by a dry and warm south side, and a moist and shady north side. Stabelhøje is accessible via small country roads. There is an infoboard at a small parking lot by the mounds. From here there is a short walk to the top of the southernmost of the two mounds. The mounds are 5–6 meters tall. Each is built of up to 650.000 rectangles of turf that where cut out by hand, corresponding to of peeled heath- and grass-turf per mound.Danmarks Kulturarvs Forening Under influence of rain draining through the surface of the mounds many of the Danish Bronze Age mounds have developed a hard mineral rich layer of soil close to the surface, that isolates the inner mound from contact with water and oxygen from the outside. This lid of hardened soil has helped preserve the artifacts insides the mounds over the centuries. The construction of Bronze Age mounds such as Stabelhøje is an undertaking that involved the work of many people using primitive pre-iron-age tools. A feat that is part of the creation of the 60.000 Stone- and Bronze Age burial mounds registered in Denmark.

After eight successive seasons playing at the third tier, Maccabi Shmuel finished third in Liga Bet South A division at the 1962–63 season and promoted to Liga Alef. However, the club's spell in Liga Alef lasted only one season, as they finished second bottom at the South division in the 1963–64 season, winning only four games, and relegated back to Liga Bet. The club played five more seasons in Liga Bet, until 1969–70, in which the club was eventually folded before the end of the season.Maccabi Tel Aviv instead of Netanya in \\"Hapoel\\" bloc at Liga Leumit Maariv, 6 May 1970, Historical Jewish Press Honours *Liga Gimel: ** Winners (1): 1954–55 References *From now on – Grasping nails (Page 3) Hadshot HaSport, 27 June 1963, archive.football.co.il *Maccabi Shmuel Tel Aviv Maariv, 2 July 1963, Historical Jewish Press Shmuel Tel Aviv Shmuel Tel Aviv Category:Association football clubs established in 1950 Category:1950 establishments in Israel Category:Football clubs in Tel Aviv Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1970 Category:1970 disestablishments in Israel ","title":"Maccabi Shmuel Tel Aviv F.C."},{"id":"44516380","text":"Philipp Sichler (born 16 July 1974) is a German cinematographer.

He was arrested in Vietnam on 30 July 2011, convicted over a two-day trial in January 2013 and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Dieu was released and exiled to France on 12 January 2017. 2011 Arrest An engineer known for being a citizen journalist and social activist, Dieu was arrested on July 30, 2011 at Tan Son Nhat Airport along with Hồ Đức Hoà and Nguyễn Văn Oai upon their return to Vietnam. This was the first in a series of arrests during the 2011 crackdown on Vietnamese youth activists. 2013 Conviction On January 8–9, 2013, a trial was held by the People's Court of Nghệ An Province for 14 democracy activists, mostly Catholics, one of which was Dang Xuan Dieu. All of them were sentenced to 3–13 years in prison on charges of subversion. During the court case, Dang Xuan Dieu was accused of participating in a training of Viet Tan, a US-based pro-democracy organization to establish democracy and reform Vietnam through peaceful and political means. Dieu has said of the allegations against him, “I have done nothing contrary to my conscience, so although the authorities may punish me physically and impose a severe sentence upon me, the government is only thereby trampling on the eternal good morals of the Vietnamese nation, which as its affair is a matter for which it must bear responsibility.” International Response Dang Xuan Dieu's conviction sparked international outcry from elected representatives and NGOs including the Center for Public Justice which described the sentencing as “outrageous lengths that Vietnamese authorities are willing to go to to suppress independent reporting.” The United States Embassy in Hanoi also released a statement which conveyed that it was “deeply troubled” by the convictions and called them “part of a disturbing human rights trend in Vietnam.” Following reports of abuse and mistreatment while arbitrarily detained, activists in Vietnam and around the world have started a grassroots campaign in support of Dang Xuan Dieu. Efforts include several NGO's issuing a joint letter calling to “cease the ill- treatment, physical and psychological abuse of Dang Xuan Dieu while in arbitrary detention” as well as the release of Dieu. Allen Weiner of Stanford Law School also filed an update to the petition to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD) in which the detention of 16 Catholic youth was ruled arbitrary and unlawful, regarding the accounts of assault Dieu has faced in prison. Various Swiss elected representatives have also visited the Vietnamese Consul in Geneva to bring attention to Dieu's case. On the 27th of October, 2014, many organisations had expressed their concern for Dang Xuan Dieu and his mistreatment in prison. Together, they released a letter calling for his immediate and unconditional release. These organisations include English PEN, ACAT France, Electronic Frontier Foundation, PEN International, Media Legal Defence Initiative and Viet Tan. 2017 Release On 13 January 2017 Dang Xuan Dieu was finally released from prison after six years of arbitrary detention and sent to Paris. This followed pressure from the EU, human rights groups, elected officials and the Vietnamese community around the globe. Allen Weiner of Stanford Law School, who serves as Dieu's international lawyer, stated: “It is gratifying that Mr. Dang Xuan Dieu has at last been released from prison. Mr. Dieu should never have been imprisoned; his arrest and imprisonment for engaging in peaceful political expression violated settled international human rights standards that Vietnam itself has accepted, as well as Vietnam’s own constitution. Mr. Dieu has suffered terribly for engaging in forms of political expression routinely practiced in democratic states all over the world. At the same time, his release highlights the limits of the Vietnamese government’s repressive power. It shows how the actions of civil society movements, international organizations, and governments around the world that support human rights can help defend the human rights of Vietnam’s citizens.” Viet Tan's chairman, Do Hoang Diem, also stated: \\"We would like to thank Professor Allen Weiner, the EU, and every human rights organization and activist who has campaigned for Dang Xuan Dieu. While Dieu should never have been arrested in the first place or exiled from his home country, we are comforted that his ordeal is now over and that he can receive much needed medical attention.” See

The Sacks property is used to control the value of certain cardinal invariants in forcing arguments. It is named for Gerald Enoch Sacks. A forcing notion is said to have the Sacks property if and only if the forcing extension has the Sacks property over the ground model. Examples include Sacks forcing and Silver forcing. Shelah proved that when proper forcings with the Sacks property are iterated using countable supports, the resulting forcing notion will have the Sacks property as well..

In the 17th century, the Ordenanças became a kind of \\"home guard\\" and reserve of the Portuguese Army. They were disbanded in 1831 History After some failed attempts made earlier, the Ordenanças were instituted by King Sebastian of Portugal on 10 December 1570. They were the first country-wide system of conscription in Portugal and thus are considered the ancestor of the future Portuguese national army. They were organized in territorial captaincies (capitanias), covering the area of a city, town or municipality and included several companies. Each captaincy was under charge of a captain-major (capitão-mor), appointed by the respective municipal councils or, in areas where an alcaide (castle governor) existed, he assumed that role. Therefore, the organization and command of the Ordenanças usually fell to the most notable local residents of each region. The base of the Ordenanças were the companies of 250 men. Each company was headed by a captain, assisted by an ensign (alferes), a sergeant, a marshal (meirinho) and a scrivener. It was divided in 10 squads, each one headed by a corporal (cabo de esquadra). For King Sebastian's Morocco Campaign of 1578, the Ordenanças mobilized 32 companies with a total of around 8000 men, constituting four terços of the Portuguese expeditionary army. After Portugal was taken over by the Habsburg dynasty in 1580, the Ordenanças declined. =17th century reorganization= The Ordenanças were revived for the Portuguese Restoration War (1640-1668). In addition, units of paid troops and units of auxiliary troops (called \\"Militias\\") were also created. These became, respectively, the first and second line of the Portuguese Army, the Ordenanças being relegated to third line and increasingly employed as a kind of home guard and reserve for the conscription of soldiers for the paid and auxiliary troops. The Ordenanças of the city of Lisbon were organized in regiments, due to the fact that the inhabitants of this city were exempt from serving in the first and second lines, between the 17th century and early 19th century. =18th century= According to the military reforms undertaken in 1764 by the Count of Lippe, the Ordenanças captaincies were grouped in 45 recruitment districts, corresponding to 43 Army first line regiments and 2 naval infantry regiments. =19th century= The Army organization of 1806 divided the country in 24 brigades of Ordenanças, each commanded by a colonel. Each brigade corresponded to a geographical area which constituted the recruitment district of an infantry regiment of the first line and of two militia regiments. Each brigade, by itself, was divided in eight captaincies and each of these in eight companies. Each captaincy corresponded to each of the eight fusiliers company in each regiment. Although mainly used as conscription reserve since the creation of the auxiliary troops in 1646, active units of Ordenanças were created for the national defense in some war periods. Some of these units acted as guerrilla forces in their respective areas, attacking the rearguard and the logistic lines of the enemy invader armies. Active units of the Ordenanças were also employed in the reinforcement of cities and fortress garrisons. A good example of this was the Peninsular War, where units of Ordenanças constituted a greater part of the garrison of the forts of the Lines of Torres Vedras, including being responsible for the manning most of its artillery. In 1809, in the scope of the Peninsular War, 16 national legions of Ordenanças were organized for the defense of the city of Lisbon. Each national legion included three battalions, with each including 10 companies of 105 men. For the mobilization of the legions, the city was divided in 16 legion districts, each subdivided in three battalion zones. In 1829, the national legions of Lisbon were disbanded and replaced by eight regiments of Ordenanças. The Ordenanças were finally extinct on the 24 March 1831, their role partially assumed by the newly created National Guard.

Sailer (born April 17, 1943 in Erlangen) is a German maxillofacial surgeon. He leads the Klinik Professor Sailer in Zurich and is the founder of the Cleft-Children International Foundation.  Life and scientific career  Sailer studied medicine from 1962 to 1968, dentistry from 1968 to 1971 at the University of Erlangen... and received the degree of Doctor of Medicine (Dr. med.) and then Doctor of Dentistry (Dr. med. dent). He completed further studies in the fields of internal medicine, gynaecology, surgery and maxillofacial surgery (1970 under Gerhard Steinhardt) and then in surgery and emergency surgery (1971/72 at the University of Würzburg under Ernst Kern). He thereafter went to Zurich to work at the university hospital there (1972–76). Under the tutelage of Hugo Obwegeser Sailer completed his knowledge in the department of maxillofacial surgery. Sailer was working as a Research Fellow at the Royal College of Surgeons of England and later in Boston, USA he worked in the department of facial plastic surgery under the guidance of R. Webster. In 1980 Sailer obtained his postdoctoral qualification (habilitation). From 1985 onwards Sailer was an Associate professor for maxillofacial surgery at the University hospital in Zurich.http://the-european.eu/story-7582/professor- hermann-f-sailer-one-man-many-faces.html In 1987 he was appointed as Chairman and Director of the Hospital and the Policlinic for Maxillofacial Surgery of the University Hospital Zurich, the Clinic for Oral Surgery and Oral Diagnosis and the Department for Maxillofacial Radiology at the Institute of Dentistry of the University of Zurich. From 1989 to 1994 he was the medical director of the institute for dentistry of the University of Zurich. From 1996 to 1998, he presided over the European Association for Cranio Maxillo Facial Surgery.http://www.eacmfs.eu/about-us/past-presidents/ Sailer has published upward of 300 scientific works in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. In 2002 Sailer founded the Klinik Professor Sailer in Zurich.http://www.presseportal.ch/de/pm/100003659/100017878 The clinic focuses on cosmetic maxillofacial and oral surgery and the surgical treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.  Research  In 1983 Sailer described a new operative procedure in which lyophilized cartilage of organ donors is used as a replacement for patients’ bones.Sailer, H.F., Transplantation of Lyophilized Cartilage in Maxillofacial Surgery: Experimental Foundations and Clinical Success, Basel 1983 In the following decades the material has been tried and tested for reconstructions of all types in the region of the skull, jaws and the face.Sailer, H.F., Longterm Results after Implantation of different lyophilized Bones & Cartilage for Reconstruction in Craniofacial Surgery, in: A.G. Montoya, Monduzzi Bologna, 1992, p. 69-72 This saves the patient from undergoing a second operation for removal of bones and cartilage. Even completely lyophilized human mandibles were used successfully in patients. In 1989, Sailer was the first to describe the use of dental implants simultaneously with the reconstruction of the atrophic maxilla.Sailer, H.F., A New Method of Inserting Endosseous Implants in Totally Atrophic Maxillae, in: J. Cran-Max-Fac Surgery Nr. 17, 1989, p. 299 Between 1992 and 2001 Sailer published several works on the production and application of bone-regenerating proteins (bone morphogenetic proteins) in collaboration with his colleagues Edit Kolb und Franz Weber. These proteins were designed to save the patient from undergoing an operative removal of the bone during reconstruction surgery in the region of the jaws and the faceSailer, H.F. & Weber F.E., Gewebsersatz durch die Anwendung von Bone morphogenetic proteins, in: Nova Acta Leopoldina Nr. 32, 2001, p. 73-80 Since the 1990s, Sailer has been working on the treatment of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The main cause for this condition are extremely narrow upper respiratory (oropharyngeal) tracts. This anatomical situation that leads to respiratory arrests, decrease of oxygen in the blood and other symptoms like high blood pressure can be eliminated by the bimaxillary Rotation Advancement Operation developed by Sailer, where the upper respiratory tracts are dilated permanentlySailer, H.F. et al., Treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea with orthognatic rotation advancement procedures; evaluation of the posterior airway space with a 3D abstract program, 20th Congress of the EA CMFA, Sept. 14-17 2010, Brügge Sailer and his team were among the first people to develop the resorbable osteosynthetic materials. The osteosynthetic material made from resorbable lactic acid-based substances is used for fixation of bone fractures as well as for fixation of bones after orthopaedic operations of the skull, the mandible and the maxilla. The material developed can be bent in the cold state as well as moulded in the hot state. As it disintegrates on its own after a programmable period, no second operation for removal of the material is necessary, whereas in case of osteosynthesis with metallic materials a second operation is requiredSailer, H.F. et al., Overview of new biodegradable self-reinforced osteosynthesis systems in cranio-maxillofacial surgery, in: International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, No. 28:75, 1999 In his studies on human physiognomy Sailer put forth the theory that a new ideal of beauty was established in the thirties and forties of the twentieth century and that this ideal is the face that protrudes forward, called \\"Anteface\\" and its extreme version \\"Hyperanteface\\". This special growth of the face is seen today with top models, actresses and actors and winners of beauty contestsSailer, H.F., Beauty and Success or the Prejudice is inborn, in: International Proceedings, 18. Congr. EACMFS, Barcelona, 2006  Cleft-Children International Foundation  Sailer founded the Cleft-Children International (CCI) Foundation in 2000.http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070925/asp/calcutta/story_8313866.asp The foundation manages centres where children with cleft lip and palate are operated free of charge.http://www.europeanceo.com/business-and- management/klinik-professor-sailer-adds-a-new-dimension-to-aesthetic-surgery/ The primary focus of this assistance is in India, where there are cleft- centres (so-called Partner Clinics) run in Mangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai (Madras),http://www.meenakshiccc.org/about-us/ Mumbai (Bombay) and Chenganoor (Kerala). Besides, there is also a cleft-centre in Romania. The concept of these centres encompass not only the performance of surgeries, but also scientific studies, e.g. reports on symphyseal mandibular cleft, reconstruction of nasal clefts,Ramanathan, Manikandhan et al., Reconstruction of Nasal Cleft Deformities Using Expanded Forehead Flaps: A Case Series, in: Journal of Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery, 2014 Dec; 13(4), pp. 568–574 the prevalence of CLP in IndiaReddy, Srinivas Gosla et al., Incidence of cleft Lip and palate in the state of Andhra Pradesh, South India, in: Indian Journal of Plastic Surgery, 2010 Jul-Dec; 43(2), pp. 184-189 or the vascular anatomy in cleft lips.Mueller AA et al., Intraoperative vascular anatomy, arterial blood flow velocity, and microcirculation in unilateral and bilateral cleft lip repair, in: Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 2012 Nov;130(5) A school for cleft-children was founded in Hyderabad in the year 2009. Two support organisations were founded in Germany in the years 2005 and 2008 to support the activities of the CCI: the Cleft-Children-Aid, Professor Hermann-Sailer Foundation in Hannover and the Cleft-Children-Assistance, Professor Hermann- Sailer Foundation in Bielefeld.

It is defined as the ratio of the engine's net power output to its displacement, the internal size. Power is measured at its rated speed and full throttle. The same measurement may also be stated in units of kilowatts per liter (kw/l). This term was first used by André Erasmus and Morné Basson. It is also termed specific power, although this should be qualified as volume-specific power. A similar measurement of power to weight ratio is also important, but takes into account the weight of the engine. Power density may also be considered similar, although this is usually stated in terms of the engine's external overall size, rather than its internal. A 'typical' car engine, of around 1980, would be considered 'highly-tuned' if it delivered more than 100 bhp/litre.

At one time the house served as the official residence of Davenport's Catholic bishop. It is a contributing property in the Riverview Terrace Historic District. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History This house was built for Selma Schricker in 1902. She was the daughter of Lorenzo Schricker, a lumber baron, and his third wife Johanna. The Schricker's had lived nearby in the Marquette Heights neighborhood. Selma had been educated in the local public schools and graduated from St. Katherine's, a private preparatory school for girls in Davenport. She had this house built after her mother's death in 1898. Selma never married and died in the house in September 1931 at the age of 50. She is buried with her mother, sister and half-brother in a mausoleum in Oakdale Memorial Gardens. The Diocese of Davenport purchased the house as the official residence of its bishop in 1933. It was the home of Bishops Henry Rohlman, Ralph Hayes, Gerald O'Keefe and William Franklin. The diocese sold the house in 1996. Mark and Judy Westrom bought the house in November 2000 and did extensive restoration work for which they received recognition from local preservationists. The house suffered a roof fire on November 6, 2010. Architecture The Selma Schricker House was designed by the prominent Davenport architectural firm of Clausen & Burrows. The two-story house is one of the finest examples of the Georgian Revival style in the city. The rectangular main block is capped with a bracketed cornice and a hipped roof. It features a symmetrical three-bay front, a large portico on the main façade, a sun porch on the east side, a porte-cochère on the west side, and a gabled wing off the back of the house. The exterior is composed of yellow-tan Roman brick with quoining on the corners of the main block, also in brick. It is built on a stone foundation. The house is situated on a slightly raised terrace, across the street from Riverview Terrace Park. The front of the house is dominated by a large semi-circular, Federal inspired, portico. It features fluted columns following the Ionic order. The main entrance into the house is framed with sidelights and a transom with Adamesque tracery. There is art glass on the double-door entrance onto the upper level of the portico. Above the portico is a large central dormer with a Palladian window. It is flanked by two smaller dormers with round-arch windows. The other dormers on the house have similar windows.

It was based on the ancient Chinese symbols of the Twelve Ornaments.  History  The Empire of China during the Manchu-led Qing dynasty did not have an official state emblem, but the flag featured the azure dragon on a plain yellow field with a red sun of the three- legged crow in the upper left corner. It became the first national flag of China and is usually referred to as the Yellow Dragon Flag. Following the end of Manchu rule, new national symbols were deemed necessary by the leaders to represent the changed circumstances. The renowned writers Lu Xun, Qian Daosun, and Xu Shoushang from the Ministry of Education were tasked with designing a new national emblem. It was presented on August 28, 1912, and was adopted as national emblem in February 1913. President-Emperor Yuan Shikai continued its use during his short imperial reign from 1915 to 1916. Coins issued during this time feature the emblem.http://coin007.com/bbs/read.php?tid=34187http://home.netvigator.com/~ykleungn/phoenix.htm A variation of the emblem was shown on orders and illustrations.http://www.guokr.com/blog/151573/?page=2 The Northern Expedition led by General Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang party led to the overthrow of the fractious but legitimate Beiyang government in 1928. This ushered in a one-party state under the Kuomintang known as the Nanjing decade. The state emblem was therefore replaced with the Kuomintang party symbol Blue Sky with a White Sun.  Design  The emblem is based on the ancient symbols of the Twelve Ornaments.Description of proposed national emblem to the state council - Lu Xun, February 1913 These are first mentioned as already ancient in the Book of Documents by Emperor Shun, who was one of the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Oral tradition holds that he lived sometime between 2294 and 2184 BCE. According to the book, the emperor wished for the symbols to be used on official robes of the state. The symbols were considered most auspicious and therefore as a set were reserved only for the emperor to be shown on his ceremonial robes. The national emblem arranges these symbols in such a way to reflect the order of achievement in western heraldry.  Symbols  *The supporter sinister is a dragon, which symbolizes strength and adaptability. The azure dragon already featured on the national flag during the preceding Qing dynasty. *On the back of the dragon is fire, which symbolises light and brightness. *Behind the head of the dragon is the crescent moon of the moon rabbit who is constantly pounding the elixir of life. *The supporter dexter is a fenghuang, or pheasant-phoenix, and represents peace and refinement. *The phoenix holds pondweed or algae in its right talon, a symbol of purity and brightness. *Behind its head are three stars, which could be the Fu Lu Shou stars, which symbolise happiness, prosperity and longevity. *Both creatures hold in one of each claws the zongyi (), which is a sacrificial cup, symbolising devotion and loyalty. The dragon and phoenix represent the natural world. In yin and yang terminology, a dragon is male yang and the phoenix a female yin. Therefore, the emperor was often identified as the dragon, while the empress was the phoenix. The inclusion of the phoenix into the national symbol, opposite but equal to the dragon, can be seen as a symbol of women being equal to men, and a visual and poignant representation of women's rights in the new China. *Featuring as the crest on top is an abstract symbol of the sun of the three-legged crow. *In the middle functioning as the escutcheon is the axe head, which symbolises courage and resolution, but also executive justice. The blade of the axe head is pointing downwards, the head is shaped like a sloping mountain. *Overlaid on the axe head are grains of rice, which symbolise nourishment and the country's agriculture. It can also be seen as a symbol of the concept of a moderately prosperous society. *In the center of the axe head framed by a pentagon is a simplified symbol of a rice ear, which again stresses the importance of agriculture as the basis of the country's wealth and prosperity. The shape on the emblem is based on a carved stone dating to the Han dynasty. *The downward-pointing blade of the axe head features a hardened edge in shape of the four sacred mountains. These represent tranquility and steadiness. The fifth Center Great Mountain is represented by the axe head. The mountains represent earth, the cups metal, the pondweed water, the rice grains wood, and fire, which are all representations of wu xing. *The figure 亞 fu underneath the axe represents two animals with their backside together. This symbolises the capability to make a clear distinction between right and wrong. *The fu sign is in the middle of complex interlacing ribbons, which connect the dragon, the phoenix and the axe to each other. The ribbons could symbolise Great Unity and Harmonious Society.

The film stars Eddie Murphy as the title character with Britt Robertson, Xavier Samuel, Lucy Fry, Christian Madsen and Natascha McElhone also starring. The movie is based on the short story \\"The Cook Who Came to Live with Us\\" written by McMartin. The film centers around a cook who becomes a caretaker and father figure to three generations of women over the years. The film debuted on April 22, 2016, at the Tribeca Film Festival and was released on September 16, 2016, by Cinelou Releasing and Freestyle Releasing. This is Murphy's first film role in four years.  Plot  Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Brooks lives with her single mother, Marie Brooks, in California. One morning, Charlie awakes to the sounds and delicious smells of cooking wafting in from the kitchen. Upon inspection, Charlie is shocked to find a strange Black man preparing breakfast. Her mother informs her that the man is Mr. Church, and he will be their new cook. Convinced that Mr. Church would intrude on the life she shared with her mother, Charlie is initially distrustful of Mr. Church and urges her mother to fire him. Marie learns that Mr. Church was hired by Richard Cannon, a wealthy entrepreneur she'd dated until she learned he was married. When Cannon died, he left provisions in his will that provided financial support for Marie, who was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. The provisions were slated to last for six months, to match her diagnosed life expectancy. When Mr. Church informs Marie that he was guaranteed a lifetime salary to care for the family, she decides to keep Mr. Church as their cook on the condition that he keeps her cancer a secret from Charlie. Six years later, Marie is still living, and Mr. Church has become a comfortable fixture in the household for both Charlie and her mother. They discover that Mr. Church is a renaissance man of sorts, being an avid reader, sketch artist, gardener, gourmet cook, jazz enthusiast, and pianist. Charlie is now a senior in high school and aware of her mother's cancer. Charlie grows distant from her mother and closer to Mr. Church because of her inability to come to terms with Marie's impending death. When Marie finds out that Charlie has decided not to attend her prom, she promises her daughter that she will stay alive if Charlie promises to go. On the big night, the three take photos as a family, and Charlie goes to the prom. Several days later, Mr. Church meets Charlie at the bus stop to deliver the news that her mother has passed. Mr. Church stays with Charlie after Marie dies. Charlie graduates from high school and gets accepted to Boston University. With some financial assistance from Mr. Church and the gift of a car, Charlie begins her freshman year. Two years later, a pregnant Charlie shows up on Mr. Church's doorstep, stating that she's returned home to take a break from her studies. Charlie eventually asks Mr. Church if she could live with him. He agrees, as long she abides by one rule, and that is to respect his privacy. One night, a drunk Mr. Church finds her snooping, they argue, and, pregnant or not, he throws her out of his home for breaking the rules. She leaves, and the next day runs into an old friend from the neighborhood, named Larson, at a store parking lot. After exchanging greetings, Charlie heads back to her car and is knocked unconscious to the ground by a kid on a skateboard. Larson drives her to the hospital just in time for Charlie to deliver her baby. Mr. Church arrives shortly after and claims her as his responsibility. Charlie gives birth to a baby girl named Izzy, and they come home to live with Mr. Church. Five years later, Charlie is working as a waitress, and she and Mr. Church are raising Izzy as a blended family. When Mr. Church becomes sick and becomes too ill to cook, Charlie begins to cook and learns that she has inherited Mr. Church's talent for cooking, based on years of watching him prepare food. Mr. Church grows sicker and eventually dies of an enlarged heart. During the wake, Charlie is startled to find out from a friend of Mr. Church, who owned a night club, that Mr. Church had played the piano there for nearly 30 years. It dawns on Charlie that Mr. Church was even more mysterious than she thought and that he had separate lives that he kept apart from one another. She'd always suspected that there was more to Mr. Church than meets the eye, and she was curious to find out more. The film ends with Charlie writing the story of her life with Mr. Church.

He worked for the publication for 17 years to help preserve the stories of Holocaust Survivors and their families. He was featured in the book Who Stole My Religion? By Richard Schwartz. The story correlated nature with Judaism faith. He was invited to write The Oxford 50th Anniversary Book of The United Nations. Patterson's most recent book is In Dante's Footsteps: My Journey to Hell (a modern update of Dante's Inferno).  Education  He studied at the Kent School, Kent, Connecticut in the class of 1954. Patterson was educated at Amherst College from where he graduated in 1958, and Columbia University, from where he received an MA in English Literature and a PhD in Religion. He later studied at the Yad Vashem Institute for Holocaust Education in Jerusalem.  Achievements  The National Council for the Social Studies awarded him the Carter G. Woodson Book Award in 1989. He received the secondary level award for his children's story, Marian Anderson. Patterson's Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust was featured in the publication The Animal’s Agenda in 2002. The article was the cover story of the March/April issue and was titled The Holocaust and Animal Exploitation. He was honored with an Animal Rights Writing award in 1995 for his story Animal Rights. The award was presented to him by the International Society for Animal Rights. ' Patterson's Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust is featured at the United States Holocaust memorial museum. He was featured in People for The Ethical Treatment of Animal's campaign titled Holocaust on Your Plate. PETA quoted Patterson's comparison of animal slaughterhouses to gas chambers of the Holocaust.  Eternal Treblinka  Political Affairs called Eternal Treblinka, \\"a wonderful book about terrible subjects\\". JVNA called it \\"very well researched ... written with great sensitivity and compassion\\". Criticism Patterson's positions have been criticized by groups, namely Jewish anti-defamation and Holocaust memorial organizations. Some claim that Patterson's comparisons between slaughterhouses and the Holocaust trivialize the experience of Holocaust victims and survivors. Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld writes on Holocaust comparisons such as Patterson's that, \\"In essence, the animal rights supporters who trivialize the Holocaust humanize animals to develop their flawed and perverse discourse.\\"Gerstenfeld, Manfred. The Abuse of Holocaust Memory: Distortions and Responses. Jerusalem: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Institute for Global Jewish Affairs, 2009; p. 121. Other opposition to Patterson's claims argue that the Holocaust and factory-farming are predicated upon different historical and sociological frameworks. Jewish animal rights activist Roberta Kalechofsky writes that although there are aesthetic similarities between the treatment of factory-farmed animals and Jews in the Holocaust, “The agony of animals arises from different causes from those of the Holocaust. Human beings do not hate animals. They do not eat them because they hate them… Human beings have no ideological or theological conflict with animals.”Kalechofsky, Roberta. Animal Suffering and the Holocaust: The Problem with Comparisons, Micah Publications, 2003 The Anti- Defamation League contests the validity of some of Patterson's historical claims, writing that, “his treatment of some of [Eternal Treblinka]’s themes moves from the offensive and ridiculous to the absurd. Apparently compelled to demonstrate that Hitler could not have been a vegetarian (nor have liked them), Patterson writes: \\"Hitler discovered that when he reduced his meat intake, he did not sweat as much, and there were fewer stains in his underwear. He also became convinced that eating vegetables improved the odors of his flatulence, a condition that distressed him terribly and caused him much embarrassment….Nonetheless, Hitler never gave up his favorite meat dishes, especially Bavarian sausages, liver dumplings, and stuffed and roasted game….” \\"Whatever his dietary preferences, Hitler showed little sympathy for the vegetarian cause in Germany. When he came to power in 1933, he banned all the vegetarian societies in Germany….Nazi persecution forced German vegetarians, a tiny minority in a nation of carnivores, either to flee the country or go underground.\\"\\"Holocaust Imagery and Animal Rights.\\" Holocaust Imagery and Animal Rights. Anti-Defamation League, 2 Aug. 2005. . Other criticisms arise from Patterson's interpretation of Abrahamic tradition as catalyzing animal abuses. Jewish Animal Rights author Richard H. Schwartz writes, “Patterson states that some historians and environmentalists blame the Genesis verse, in which God grants people dominion over the earth, for western civilization's destruction and despoliation of the environment. By failing to mention traditional Jewish interpretations of this verse that define dominion as responsible stewardship rather than as domination, he may leave the mistaken impression that the exploitation of animals and the environment is religiously sanctioned.”Schwartz, Richard. \\"Judaism and Vegetarianism: Book Review, \\"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust\\"\\" Judaism and Vegetarianism: Book Review, \\"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust\\" Jewish Vegetarians of North America,.

Here are some other readings that do the same. * \\"Speciesism as a Precondition to Justice\\" by Michael Barilan- Barilan discusses how the use of certain members of a community for the benefit of others is justified by moral sociability, and not moral considerability. The idea explored here is that speciesism occurs due to differences in sociability within a group, and not due to consideration of individual rights among species. This idea is compared to Nazi racism because this institution gave praise to the strong and condemned the weak, humans and animals alike.Y. Michael Barilan. (2004).

Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/4236729 * \\"Can the Treatment of Animals Be Compared to the Holocaust?\\" by David Sztybel- Sztybel gives a very detailed comparison of animal treatment and the Holocaust, through the use of a thirty- nine-point comparison. He counters the protest that these comparisons should not be made by questioning whether or not animal liberationists have the right to express their thoughts and beliefs. The four points considered are whether or not a comparison between animal treatment and the Holocaust is offensive, whether this comparison trivializes the happenings of the Holocaust, if significant differences are overlooked through comparison, and the possibility that there is an affinity between animal liberationists and Nazis. Sztybel argues that arguments against him are insufficient in proving those four points, and this actually further supports claims of poor animal treatment happening presently.Sztybel, D. (2006).

Stein also discusses how human discrimination is different than the continual mistreatment of animals in society. This critique finally argues that animals in certain living spaces should not be divided into categories based on their proximity and association with humans.Stein, T. (2015).

Sax explains how his concern for animal treatment and emotion is not a way of trivializing what happened to humans during the holocaust. Additionally, he looks into certain species’ roles in human culture, the psychology of animals, biologically based ideologies, and methods of animal protection that were once implemented by the Nazis. Finally, Sax discusses the Nazi and overall German views of animal slaughter and death, and the role this may have played in the Holocaust.Sax, B. (2000).

The district includes a large portion of Lubbock County and all of Gaines, Borden, Scurry, Terry, Lynn and Mitchell Counties. On January 13, 2015, he succeeded Charles Perry, who won a special election in the summer of 2014 to the Texas State Senate. Biography Burrows graduated from Monterey High School in Lubbock. In 2001, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Rhodes College, a private college in Memphis, Tennessee, affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. In 2004, Burrows received a Master of Business Administration from the Rawls College of Business at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and a Juris Doctor from the Texas Tech University School of Law. He and his father, Dennis Ray Burrows (born 1947), are in private partnership together. The younger Burrows is licensed to practice law in New Mexico and Texas. He is a member of the West Texas Home Builders Association and the Texas Residential Construction Commission. In 2010, he was a member of the Lubbock Charter Review Committee and used to serve on the Lubbock Zoning Board of Adjustments. An active Republican since 2008, Burrows was named by the party leadership to succeed Perry as the party nominee for the Texas House after Perry won the contest to succeed veteran Senator Robert L. Duncan. Duncan had resigned to become the new chancellor of the Texas Tech University System, succeeding Kent Hance in that position. Burrows defeated his Democratic opponent, Max R. Tarbox, 26,932 (81.2 percent) to 6,218 (18.8 percent) percent in the general election held on November 4, 2014. Burrows said that he will work closely with regional colleagues Charles Perry and John Frullo, a neighboring state representative from District 84, who was first elected in 2010. Frullo said that Burrows \\"has a lot of agriculture in his district, and that is good. And there are a lot of committees where he can do a lot of good.” Burrows indicated he would seek a seat on the Agriculture & Livestock Committee. In the general election held on November 6, 2018, Burrows won his third legislative term with 45,327 votes (77.3 percent). The Democrat, Drew Landry, trailed with 13,276 votes (22.7 percent). On August 22, 2019, Burrows announced he would seek re-election. Concurrently, Texas Governor Greg Abbott endorsed Burrows. Burrows ran unopposed in the 2020 Republican primary.  Ways and Means Committee Chairman in the 86th Session  After the 2018 election, Burrows was elected as Chair of the House Republican Caucus. In the 86th Texas Legislative Session, Burrows was appointed to chair the powerful Ways and Means Committee. In this capacity Burrows authored the landmark HB2, which enables Texas taxpayers to control local tax rates and tax increases. The legislation was partnered with another piece of legislation which dealt with public school finance reform, HB3; that bill provides almost $5 billion in property tax relief and increased the state's share of school funding. In addition to these bills, Burrows was the driving force behind legislation supporting Texas firefighters, an issue he had begun to successfully address during the prior session. During the 86th Session, Burrows co-authored House Bill 1521 -- \\"which would penalize insurers that illegally deny Texas first responders access to medical treatment for line-of-duty injuries covered under state workers’ compensation laws. This proposed legislation would amend Section 415.021 of the Labor Code to add sanctions, administrative penalties, and other remedies, including attorney's fees, for administrative violations by self- or collectively insured municipalities obligated to cover eligible workers’ compensation claims. The amount of the administrative penalty shall not be less than two times the total amount of benefits payable in connection with the first responder employee's claim.\\" HB 1525 - also authored by Burrows, Flower Mound Republican Senator Jane Nelson and Dallas Democratic Senator Royce West, will enable Texas to collect more than half a billion dollars over the next two years after enforcing the state’s sales tax across state lines. Prior to this legislation, the state could only force sellers to collect Texas sales tax if they had a physical location in Texas, putting small businesses at a financial disadvantage. Resignation as Republican Caucus Chairman Burrows was involved in a June 12, 2019 meeting between House Speaker Dennis Bonnen and Michael Quinn Sullivan of Empower Texans. At the meeting, which Sullivan secretly recorded, Burrows allegedly presented Sullivan with a \\"hit list\\" of Republican members both Burrows and Bonnen would like to see the organization defeat politically in the 2020 Republican primaries in exchange for House media credentials for Sullivan's group. Bonnen hoped to stop Sullivan's Empower Texans from criticizing him and his fellow Republican's efforts in the 86th Session. Initially, Bonnen denied the allegations made by Sullivan. A member of the alleged \\"hit list\\", Ernest Bailes, has called upon Burrows to answer for his alleged involvement, stating the \\"deft silence only solidifies truth within the allegations.\\" On August 12, 2019, the Texas House General Investigating Committee voted unanimously to ask the Texas Rangers's Public Integrity Unit to investigate for \\"reasonable suspicion\\" that Bonnen engaged in \\"potential criminal behavior,\\" which would include \\"the quid pro quo offer of media credentials in exchange for political targeting\\" of Republican House members that Bonnen wanted defeated at the polls.\\"Pollock, Cassandra. Texas Rangers asked to investigate allegations against House Speaker Dennis Bonnen, Texas Tribune, Austin, Texas, August 12, 2019. On August 19, the Dallas Morning News reported that Republican state representative Jim Murphy and Sullivan associate Daniel Greer stated that after listening to the secret recording, the \\"list\\" from which Burrows read was the names of Republican House members who had voted against a bill, popular with conservatives, prohibiting the ability of local governments, like cities and counties, to spend public funds on lobbying (commonly referred to as the \\"taxpayer-funded lobbying\\" bill). Following reports that Sullivan had recorded the meeting and had begun to make the recording available to a small group of people, Burrows resigned as Republican Caucus Chairman and Bonnen issued an apology for saying \\"terrible things\\" during the meeting. Burrows spoke to local Lubbock, Texas media on August 22, 2019, and described his reasons for participation in the meeting with Sullivan and his expected, but not realized, goals in meeting with Sullivan. State Representative Stephanie Klick, from Fort Worth was appointed to the position of Republican Caucus chair to replace Burrows. On August 31, 2019, Klick called for the release of the recording to the public. Sullivan published the recording in October 2019, and the release of the recordings’ negative comments by Burrows and Bonnen toward local governments prompted angry responses from a number of Texas county and city officials. In mid December 2019, a House General Investigating Committee unanimously adopted a report from its legal advisers that said House Speaker Dennis Bonnen “likely violated” state law during the June meeting but the committee took no other action and said the matter was closed. Burrows remained as the Ways and Means Committee Chairman. Personal life Burrows is married to the former Elisabeth Hause, who grew up in South Texas in a family engaged in cattle ranching and oil and natural gas. They have three sons. The family is evangelical Christian.

Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) is an effective treatment for patients suffering from decreased levels of dopamine. Often dopamine agonists, compounds that activate dopamine receptors in the absence of that receptor's physiological ligand, the neurotransmitter dopamine, are used in this therapy. DRT has been shown to reduce symptoms and increase lifespan for patients suffering from Parkinson’s Disease. Dopamine regulation plays a critical role in human mental and physical health. The neurons that contain the neurotransmitter are clustered in the midbrain region in an area called the substantia nigra. In Parkinson's patients, the death of dopamine-transmitting neurons in this area leads to abnormal nerve-firing patterns that cause motor problems. Research in patients with schizophrenia indicates abnormalities in dopamine receptor structure and function. Dopamine Replacement Therapy in Parkinson’s Disease DRT has been used to improve motor skills, impulsivity, and decision making in Parkinson’s patients. In Parkinson’s Disease patients, dopamine deficiencies can be seen in two key areas of the brain: the dorsal frontostriatal circuit, the area responsible for motor skills and task- switching, and the ventral frontostriatal circuit, the area responsible for impulsivity. Impairment in these areas can be treated with dopamine agonists, a group of medications that mimics the ligand dopamine and bonds to dopamine receptors. Other medications that convert into dopamine, as opposed to functioning as dopamine analogs, alleviate the effects of the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons. One dopamine precursor, Levodopa, was the first drug approved specifically for Parkinson’s disease. DRT increases dopamine in the brain to optimal levels in order to return motor skills, impulsivity, and decision making to normal function. Although DRT can improve motor skills and decision making in patients with mild to severe Parkinson’s Disease, an overdose of dopamine is associated with impaired impulsivity (see next section). The Overdose Hypothesis Dopamine deficiency is more severe in the dorsal frontostriatal circuit than in the ventral frontostriatal circuit. However, DRT does not target these areas differently, and delivers the same amount of dopamine to both areas of the brain. DRT medication can increase dopamine in the dorsal frontostriatal circuit to an optimal level, leading to an improvement in task-switching activities and working memory. Simultaneously, the ventral frontostriatal circuit will experience an overdose of dopamine that will lead to increased impulsive behavior. Problems controlling impulsivity due to DRT drugs have been shown to induce impulsive forms of behavior, such as compulsive gambling. Although DRT drugs can worsen impulse control, a lack of DRT drugs does not necessarily result in better impulse control. Levels of improvement depend on the severity of psychiatric disorder. Early Studies of Dopamine Therapy in Schizophrenia In patients with schizophrenia, evidence indicates abnormal dopamine receptor D2 structure, as well as a reduced link between dopamine receptor D1 and receptor D2. Studies have shown that targeting the D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex can improve the cognitive functioning of schizophrenic patients. However, adverse effects of dopamine therapy may occur, including difficulty with impulse control. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of dopamine therapy in patients suffering from schizophrenia.

Biography He was born before 1662, the second son of John Swinton, of Swinton in Berwickshire, and his wife Margaret, daughter of William Stewart, 2nd Lord Blantyre. Swinton's father had become a Quaker, was an active politician during the Protectorate, and had had his estates forfeited at the Restoration. The younger Swinton, who remained a Presbyterian, became a successful merchant in the Netherlands. He succeeded his elder brother as head of the family in 1687 and returned to Scotland at the time of the Glorious Revolution, of which his uncle Lord Mersington was a supporter. In 1689 he was appointed a commissioner of supply for Berwickshire, and the following year he was restored to his father's estates. From 1690 until 1707 he was a commissioner for Berwickshire in the Parliament of Scotland. He became a director of the Company of Scotland and of the Bank of Scotland in 1695, incurring huge losses during the Darien Scheme.https://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?action=print&id;=54250&filename;=williamii_trans&type;=trans As he is also one of the signatories on the Act of Union of 1707 this means he was one of the several persons who were fully compensated for their losses in return for signing the Union with England.https://www.scottisharchivesforschools.org/union1707/documentDownloads/Signatures.pdf As such he was one of those Parcel of Rogues referred to in the bitter poem by Robert Burns.

From 1974–77 she attended the Department of Biochemistry, King's College London where she completed her PhD. During this time Foyer also attended a course on immunology at Chelsea College, London. In 1998 Foyer was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Biology. Work Foyer researches plant growth regulation and development under optimal circumstances and in conditions of stress (caused by, for example, lack of water, low temperatures, high light, infestation by aphids). Her work has a special focus on how cellular reduction/oxidation (redox), homeostasis and signalling interact with phytohormone–mediated pathways, particularly involving abscisic acid, auxin and strigolactones. Her research is centered on ascorbate and glutathione as key regulators of plant responses to stress and on how redox processes associated with primary metabolism particularly photosynthesis and respiration regulate gene expression. The department addresses research problems of intrinsic scientific interest but is always mindful of the needs of agriculture and food security. In addition to undertaking fundamental studies on model plant species such as arabidopsis thaliana, research in the Foyer lab includes work which relates the research findings, particularly in relation to enhancing stress tolerance, to crop species such as soybean, maize and barley.

They are small fish, averaging at around in length. They are bright orange and transparent yellow in life, with a white stripe running down from between the eyes to the upper lip and a dark brown spot at the base of the tail fin. They are usually found in large schools in the sloping or vertical drop-offs at coral reef edges. Taxonomy Trimma nasa belongs to the Trimma nasa species group of the dwarfgoby genus Trimma. It was included in the true goby subfamily Gobiinae in the goby family Gobiidae. However, the 5th Edition of Fishes of the World does not give any subfamilies in the Gobiidae. It was first recognized as a separate species in 2005 by the ichthyologist Richard Winterbottom. The type specimens were collected from Siquijor Island in the Philippines. Though specimens of this species have been recovered previously, they were misidentified with Griffiths' dwarfgoby (Trimma griffithsi). The generic name Trimma is derived from Greek τρίμματος (trimmatos, \\"something crushed\\"). The specific name is derived from English \\"nasal [helmet]\\" in reference to the stripe on the snout. Description Like other dwarfgobies, the nasal dwarfgoby are typically very small fish. Maximum recorded lengths are for males, and for females. The space between the two eyes (interorbital) is about the same width as the eyeballs. The dorsal (back) fin has seven spines and eight soft rays. The anal fin has one spine and seven to nine soft rays. The fifth and usually fourth ray of the pelvic fin branches into two. The caudal (tail) fin is squarish (truncate) in shape. Two rows of scales are present in front of the pelvic fin. Scales are absent on the cheeks. In life, the body is transparent yellow with bright orange abdominal cavity lining and iridescent blue and green highlights on the fins. There is a large dark brown spot at the base of the tail fin. There is usually a thin white stripe (dark in preserved specimens) on the snout, running from the upper lip to the area between the eyes. It overlies a rounded hump, also from the upper lip to just before the eye orbits. This is the source of their specific name, since it resembles the projecting bar of medieval nasal helmets. Distribution Nasal dwarfgobies can be found in the Western Pacific coral reefs usually at depths of , though they have been known to reach below the water's surface. They have been recorded in Australia (including the Great Barrier Reef), Fiji, Indonesia, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Ecology Nasal dwarfgobies generally congregate in large, loose schools near coral reef drop-offs pockmarked by caves or recesses. They may school together with related species like the blue-striped cave goby (Trimma tevegae). They usually orient themselves vertically with their heads facing upwards along the coral reef wall and presumably feed on zooplankton traveling down the water column. When threatened they will quickly retreat inside hiding places. Nasal dwarfgobies are very short-lived. The maximum recorded age is only 87 days. Of this, around 34 days are spent as pelagic larvae which is 39% of the total lifespan (in contrast to less than 1% for the vast majority of other reef fish species). They have high mortality rates, averaging at 4.7% per day. Their mating behavior has not been studied, but females are usually larger than males and more numerous (at a ratio of 1 male per 1.6 females). Since no specimens with intermediate gonad morphologies have been collected thus far, it is likely that they are not hermaphroditic as some other goby species are. They have also been observed sheltering in the tentacles of the hoplites corallimorph (Paracorynactis hoplites), with no apparent adverse effects from the stinging cells. Importance Nasal dwarfgobies are not fished for food by humans. However, like other dwarfgobies in the genera Trimma and Eviota, they may occupy a valuable trophic role in the reef ecosystems due to their short lifespans and thus higher biomass generation rates.

The publication was founded in 2012 by Alex Skatell. Skatell serves as its CEO, with Camden Stuebe as President and Shushanna Walshe, former political director at ABC News as the Editor-At-Large. The site covers general interest topics including politics, culture, entertainment, and viral news content. History = Founding and early expansion = In 2012, Alex Skatell, a former digital director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, launched the Independent Journal Review, using $40,000 that Skatell had earned via a software application that he developed at college and $20,000 borrowed from his parents. He believed that there was a gap in the market for a publication that would appeal to \\"a more mainstream center-right audience\\" and began aggregating news stories on a Facebook page called Conservative Daily. Skatell promoted the page and later launched the Independent Journal Review. Skatell then teamed up with Phil Musser, a former executive director of the Republican Governors Association, to launch IMGE and Media Group of America. Atkinson then hired a staff of writers and editors to contribute to and grow the journal. In 2012, Skatell hired Bert Atkinson as chief editor. By November 2014, the organization employed over 62 staff across Media Group of America. The site attracted an audience that largely lived outside Washington D.C. political circles that had broader interests than average consumers of political news. In June 2015, they hired Benny Johnson as a \\"creative director\\" from National Review. Johnson had previously worked at Buzzfeed, being fired after plagiarizing content from other websites. In March 2015, the site was named \\"Best New Publisher of the Year\\" by Digiday. = 2016 election cycle = During the 2015 campaign season, a number of Independent Journal Review political videos acquired national attention, such as Lindsey Graham destroying his cell phone and Ted Cruz making \\"machine gun bacon.\\" Then, Independent Journal Review partnered with ABC News to host the Republican Presidential Debate on February 6, 2016. During the 2016 election, Independent Journal Review was listed in the top 10 websites engaged per news story on Facebook. In November 2016, Independent Journal Review became one of the first two digital media companies accepted into the News Media Alliance, formerly the Newspaper Association of America. = Post-2016 election = In January 2017, the website was noted for being the first major U.S. news outlet to confirm that Judge Neil Gorsuch would be nominated by president Donald Trump for the Supreme Court, news which failed to spread quickly due to other media outlets' distrust of the Review. During United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's diplomatic trip to Asia in March 2017, the Independent Journal Review was the only news publication invited to send a reporter to accompany the trip. Several key members of the Independent Journal Review's editorial staff, including Benny Johnson and Kyle Becker, were suspended in March 2017 over an opinion piece on former President Barack Obama's visit to Hawaii prior to a judge's ruling on the travel ban. Becker later resigned from IJR, and Johnson was fired from Independent Journal Review in October 2017. In May 2017, Haley Byrd, a congressional reporter for the Independent Journal Review, said she was kicked out of the Speaker's Lobby in the U.S. Capitol because she was wearing a sleeveless dress; Byrd says she was told that she was violating the rules. In July 2017, IMGE CEO Phil Musser purchased IMGE and formally split the agency out of Media Group of America. A few months later, in September 2017, Musser was named Senior Vice President of Communications at Boeing and left IMGE to a new leadership group. In mid 2017, IJR launched conservative and liberal verticals, IJR Red and IJR Blue to transparently present a variety of perspectives around conversations across the United States. The site broadened its mission to help organize communities around a set of facts and a variety of perspectives.

Background  Dating back from 1925, the Italian Army had engaged in experiments to find a new model of combat helmet that could replace the aging and not completely satisfactory Adrian helmet adopted in 1915; coupled to this was the fact that the Adrian was originally a French design, and it was probably felt (under the fascist regime) that an Italian-designed model was more appropriate. In 1932 after lengthy trials (with prototypes from many Italian and foreign firms) it was decided to adopt one of them as the M31 helmet. However this model (recognizable by the small crest on its top) wasn't completely satisfactory, because its cupolar blowhole design wasn't seen as being efficient, and was rather perceived as a structural weakness. By replacing it with three ventilation holes (two on the sides and one on the rear), the Model 33 was born, and was adopted with a circular on November 29, 1934.  Usage  Italian M33/47 from 1956 While not possessing the same degree of protection offered by the German Stahlhelm, the M33 was seen as a successful design, since it offered three times the resistance of the Adrian, was light at 1.2kg, and was relatively comfortable. During World War II, it was the main combat helmet of the Italian Army, but lack of resources meant that some second-line troops were issued the Adrian helmet, or even no helmet at all. It continued to serve as the main combat helmet of the Esercito Italiano until the 1990s.
