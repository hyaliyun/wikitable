Built in 1873, it is one of the major surviving works of local architect George W. Orff in the city, and one of the few of the period to survive Bangor's Great Fire of 1911. Description and history The Adams-Pickering Block is located in central Bangor, just south of West Market Square, at the northwest corner of Main and Middle Streets. It is a four- story, Second Empire-style building, which is distinctive for its granite facade, cast iron trim, and mansard roof. The Pickering Block, at the corner with Middle Street, is six bays wide, while the Adams Block, to its right, is seven. Windows on the second and third floors are set in segmented-arch openings, with decorative key-stoned hoods. When built in 1871, its ground floor had mostly cast iron elements, but the storefronts have been modernized, and only fragments of the original trim remain. The twin blocks were built in 1871 to a design by Bangor native architect George W. Orff, and was built on the site of \\"The Main Street Fire\\" of 1872, which killed one and injured 8.The Bangor FireNew York Times, Oct. 13, 1872. Retrieved June 15, 2008 It was one of a number of high-profile commissions Orff executed in downtown Bangor in those years, of which this is a rare survivor of both the Great Fire of 1911 and urban renewal of the 1960s. The building was one of the largest local commissions for Orff, who subsequently migrated to Minnesota. George W. Pickering (1799-1876) was a prominent local merchant and President of the Kenduskeag Bank (incorporated 1847). His maternal grandfather Jacob Dennett was one of the original settlers of Bangor, part of a group which arrived in 1771. Pickering was also the 12th Mayor of Bangor (1853‚Äì54), and Vice President of the Bangor Theological Seminary. Pickering Square in Downtown Bangor is named for him.

A subrange within the larger Ouachita Mountains that extend from Oklahoma to western Arkansas, the Kiamichi Mountains sit within Le Flore, Pushmataha, and McCurtain counties near the towns of Poteau and Albion. The foothills of the Kiamichi Mountains sit within Haskell County, Northern Le Flore County, and Northern Pittsburg County. Its peaks, which line up south of the Kiamichi River, reach 2,500 feet in elevation. The range was the namesake of Kiamichi Country, the official tourism designation for southeastern Oklahoma, until the designation was changed to Choctaw Country. The Kiamichi Mountains Black bear, coyote, bobcat, deer, cougar, minks, bats, bald eagles (sacred to the Choctaw), varieties of woodpeckers, doves, owls, road runners and 328 vertebrate species are native to this region. The Kiamichi Mountains are ancient. By projecting the existing mountains down to their subsurface roots geologists know that they once stood as tall as the modern-day Rocky Mountains, which are much younger. The highly serrated, jagged appearance of the Rockies and other tall mountain ranges may be attributed to their youth. By contrast the Kiamichi Mountains, which are much older‚Äîand now shorter‚Äîfeature the highly eroded characteristics common among much older mountains. Geologists generally define a mountain as a natural landform topping at least 1,000 feet in elevation. Numerous of the mountains, particularly those along the Kiamichi River's lower reaches, measure between 700 and 900 feet in elevation. Although called ‚Äúmountains‚Äù they are, more formally, hills. Precise definitions of the extent and scope of the Kiamichi Mountains have never been formally assigned. They constitute more of a cultural construct than formal geographical designation. Local residents generally identify the mountains as those occurring on either side of the Kiamichi River along the full extent of its course, until it flows into the flat coastal plain of southern Oklahoma. Several groupings of mountains‚Äîall subranges of the Ouachita Mountains‚Äîmay be found in southeastern Oklahoma, some of them associated with the Kiamichi Mountains, and some not. North of the Kiamichi Mountains are the Winding Stair Mountains, named by early American explorers for their cascading appearance as a series of stairsteps. East of Little River are the Bok Tuklo Mountains, which are commonly considered a continuation of the Kiamichi Mountains, although far removed from the namesake river. These mountains take their name from Bok Tuklo County in the old Choctaw Nation. Bok Tuklo, in the Choctaw language, means ‚Äútwo creeks‚Äù and refers to Lukfata Creek and Yasho Creek, both in McCurtain County, Oklahoma.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 26. Portions of the mountains are protected by the Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness National Wildlife Refuge and the Ouachita National Forest. The wildlife refuge includes much of the Kiamichi River's upper reaches and headwaters. The National Forest exists as two spurs, or arms, of its larger area in Arkansas, and may be found in Le Flore County and McCurtain County. Substantial portions of the mountains are owned by timber companies, who operate massive tree plantations consisting of fast-growing pine trees. Logging is the region's chief industry. Tourism is also important, although it makes a smaller economic impact. The Talimena Scenic Drive, connecting Talihina, Oklahoma with Mena, Arkansas is a popular destination during autumn. Fishing is popular year-round, as is hunting during hunting season. Several flood control reservoirs built and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the state, including Broken Bow Lake, Clayton Lake, McGee Creek Lake, Pine Creek Lake, and Sardis Lake (Oklahoma), are framed by views of the mountains and add to the area's scenic beauty. Due to the restricted nature of land ownership in the region‚Äîwith much of it owned by the federal government or timber companies‚Äîthe Kiamichi Mountains remain rustic, rural, economically undeveloped and with few population centers. Climate The Kiamichi Mountains experience a humid subtropical climate, with long, hot, humid summers, and short and cool winters. Temperatures below zero are very rare, but possible. Light snowfall usually occurs once or twice each winter, but rarely lasts more than 24 hours without melting. Substantial amounts of precipitation fall throughout the year. Summers can be extremely hot, and are usually very humid. Thunderstorms are common throughout the spring and summer. Higher elevations are substantially cooler than the valleys during the day, and tend to receive more precipitation throughout the year.

Described as 'Noirists', their musical style combined elements of punk, new wave, dance, prog rock, indie and Britpop. The band referred to themselves simply as 'new wave'. Haunts' line-up consisted of Banks (vocals, guitar, synth), Alex Woodcock (guitar, backing vocals), Gareth Grover (drums, backing vocals) and Mitch Mitchener (bass guitar, backing vocals). Haunts disbanded in 2009. Early history Haunts formed in late 2006. Shortly after posting a demo of the song \\"Bomz II Drop\\" online, they received a request from Welsh band Lostprophets to support them at a sold out 'secret' show at London's Scala on 26 April 2007. This was followed by tours with Switches, The Sunshine Underground and Funeral For a Friend, as well as many low-key dates at indie club nights in London. Haunts made their first festival appearance on 24 June 2007 at London's Hyde Park Calling festival, which was headlined by Aerosmith. Haunts released their debut single, \\"Low Slung City Skyline\\" through Grand Recordings in September 2007 on 7\\" vinyl. The single was limited to 500 pieces and featured unusually elaborate packaging. All musical and design production was done by the band themselves, a work ethic they persevered with on subsequent releases (Woodcock is a graduate of Chelsea College of Art & Design; Banks was an up-and-coming record producer, having just produced Gallows' critically acclaimed debut album Orchestra of Wolves Orchestra of Wolves liner notes Epitaph Records). The single won BBC Radio 1's 'Fresh Meat' competition hosted by DJ Zane Lowe. After the single's release Haunts toured extensively on the club NME circuit and with indie rock band Boy Kill Boy. Haunts' second single, \\"Underground\\" was released in April 2008 through Black Records, again as a limited edition vinyl, this time a heavyweight blood-red disc with gatefold case, mirror- finish writing, and a glossy black outer sleeve. Again, Zane Lowe championed the single on his BBC Radio 1 show but this time the single was also picked up by XFM and other stations. The accompanying video clip also aired on MTV2. Appearances at London's Camden Crawl and Brighton's The Great Escape Festival also helped promote the single. On 13 June, Haunts headlined Club NME at London's KOKO. Other festival appearances in 2008 included Donington's Download, Scotland's T In The Park, Newquay's Boardmasters, Reading Festival, the Animal Windfest and the FS04 Freeze Festival at Battersea Power Station. In August, Haunts released their third independent single, \\"Live Fast Die Young\\", as a limited edition 2-part 7\\" vinyl set comprising a coloured vinyl with gatefold sleeve and a picture disc. The release was supported by support slots with Lostprophets and The Automatic. Anticipating the imminent release of their debut album, October saw Haunts tour the UK as part of the 'No Half Measures Tour' which also featured The Holloways, Underground Heroes, Bear Hands and Regards. Near the end of the tour on 31 October, Haunts released the \\"London's Burning\\" EP. Unlike previous singles which were released both on limited 7 inch vinyl and iTunes, this EP was available exclusively in digital form via the 7digital music downloading service. The EP included a 'Halloween Remix' of \\"London's Burning\\" and a cover of Billy Idol's \\"White Wedding\\". Debut LP Haunts released their eponymous debut album on 17 November through the independent label Black Records. Entirely self-produced and recorded in the band's own studio, the LP reinforced the band's DIY work ethic. The LP was mixed by Dan Weller and Justin Hill of WellerHill productions at their private studio in Old Street, London. Haunts toured the UK and Europe extensively to promote the LP, both as a headline act and as a support band for White Lies and Eagles Of Death Metal. August saw the release of the \\"Love Is Blind\\" EP and a UK tour, with Sharks as main support. Haunts disbanded at some point in the months following the tour. Influences Although the band were cagey about their personal influences, they were known to perform cover versions of songs by artists linked to the new wave genre such as Elvis Costello, Depeche Mode, The Cure, Devo, The Police and Talking Heads. Comparisons to other artists were erratic but included a diverse range of bands such as Talking Heads, Bauhaus, Queens of the Stone Age, Refused, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand and The Futureheads. Banks' distinctive deep, dry voice has been likened to Nick Cave and David Bowie.

K.M. Kenny Millions live Biography Kenneth Keshavan Maslak was born in downtown Detroit, Michigan to a family of Ukrainian immigrants who worked at the Ford Motor Company. Kenny began studying music from his grandfather at the age of five on the mandolin, and then started on the clarinet and saxophone at the age of six. He began working professionally from the age of 12. While attending Cass Technical High School, Kenny became a student of Larry Teal and Donald Sinta. After high school Maslak studied music and psychology at the University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University and North Texas State University where he studied music composition with Martin Mailman in the late 1960s. Following this he played with Motown touring bands and many other jazz and R&B; bands. After two years living in San Francisco and playing with Charles Moffett, Ray Anderson and David Murray, Maslak moved to New York City in 1972 and participated in the New York loft scene during the 1970s, performing his compositions frequently at Studio Rivbea, Ladies' Fort, Maslak Gallerxy, The Kitchen, Five Spot Cafe, Village Vanguard, CBGB, Museum Of Modern Art and at the Charlotte Moorman avant-garde festivals. At The Kitchen he performed with experimental musicians such as Garrett List, Rhys Chatham, Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson and associated with John Cage. During that period he developed his conceptual style of musical performance which he refers to as Multiplexmulti. Kenny also invented the Hum Ha Horn which he recorded with on some of his early LP releases. From 1978 to 1981 Maslak lived in Amsterdam, Netherlands where he played in avant-garde jazz circles with groups such as Instant Composer's Pool and recorded several titles for Leo Records, Black Saint Records and various other European labels with his trio. He also formed a punk rock-free jazz group, Loved by Millions, in which he began to use the pseudonym Kenny Millions. He returned to New York City in 1981 to 1987 then first moving to Miami, Florida in 1987. In 1988 to 1989 Kenny lived in Brussels, Belgium and in Moscow, The Soviet Union. Back to Miami, Florida in 1989 he and his wife became restaurateurs and opened up Sushi Blues Cafe and then afterwards Cafe Jamm in Florida, which they retired from in 2011. Kenny also collaborated with Hannibal Lokumbe, Abbey Rader, Paul Bley, Jack DeJohnette, Katsuyuki Itakura, Kazutoki Umezu, Sergey Kuryokhin, Sam Rivers, Sunny Murray, Frank Wright, Rashied Ali, Curtis Fuller, Marty Cook, Otomo Yoshihide, Toshinori Kondo, Roland Kirk, Misha Mengelberg, Han Bennink, Peter Br√∂tzmann, Derek Bailey, Roscoe Mitchell, John Tchicai, Dr. John, Mick Taylor, Bobby Keys, The Rolling Stones, Larry Coryell, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Eddie Kirkland, Thurston Moore, Otto von Schirach, Blowfly (musician), Kool Keith, Tatsuya Nakatani, Weasel Walter, Frank \\"Rat Bastard\\" Falestra, etc. Discography * Cass Tech Symphony Band (Cass Tech, 1964) * One O'clock Lab Band (North Texas State, 1969) * Lower East Side Insane Shit (Hum Ha, 1974) * Multiplexmulti (Hum Ha, 1977) * Variations on a Coffee Machine (Kharma, 1977) * Maslak 1000 (Waterland, 1978) * Buddha's Hand (Circle, 1978) * New York Bust Out (Hum Ha, 1978) * Mayhem in Our Streets (Waterland, 1979) * Humanplexity (Leo, 1979) * Loved by Millions (Leo, 1980) * Big Time (Daybreak, 1981) * Blaster Master (Black Saint, 1981) * Dead in Germany (Moers Music, 1982) * Japan/Japon (DIW, 1983) * Lovely (ITM, 1985) * Better and Better (Leo, 1986) * Get the Money Whatever It Takes (Leo, 1987) * The Ass (Hum Ha, 1988) * Mother Russia (Leo, 1989) * Madmen from the Moon (Soundings of the Planet, 1990) * Not To Be a Star (Black Saint, 1992) * Soul Brothers (Hum Ha, 1992) * Romance in the Big City (Leo, 1993) * Play Satie (Hum Ha, 1993) * Harmonic Motion (Third Stream, 1994) * Excuse Me Mr. Satie (Leo, 1994) * Suburban Utopic (Abray, 1995) * Jet Lag (Solyd, 1996) * Friends Afar (Sound Wave, 1996) * Dear John Cage (Long Arm, 1996) * Ground Zero Plays Standards (Nani, 1997) * Live at the Rip-Off Knitting Factory (Hum Ha, 1997) * Kenny Millions Jams (Hum Ha, 1998) * Without Kuryokhin (Long Arms, 1999) * Ping Pong Birthday (Hum Ha, 1999) * Back to It (Hum Ha, 2000) * Live in Hollywood (Hum Ha, 2000) * I Wish I Was A Bird (Hum Ha, 2000) * Eat Cake (Hum Ha, 2000) * Beautiful and Boring (Hum Ha, 2000) * Junko's Dream (Hum Ha, 2000) * Mixed Nuts (Hum Ha, 2000) * No Money No Honey (Hum Ha, 2001) * Brother Charles (Hum Ha, 2001) * April in Japan (Hum Ha, 2001) * Masking Tape Music (Hum Ha, 2001) * Tokyo Is Now (Hum Ha, 2001) * Screams and Whispers (Hum Ha, 2001) * Blues Inside Out (Hum Ha, 2001) * Live in Nasu (Hum Ha, 2001) * Sun and Fun (Hum Ha, 2001) * Space Between Worlds (Hum Ha, 2001) * Blue Skies (Hum Ha, 2001) * Jazz Fantasy (Hum Ha, 2002) * When You're Smiling (Hum Ha, 2002) * Let Freedom Swing (Hum Ha, 2002) * Kenny Meets Tatsu (Hum Ha, 2002) * Midnight in Chicago (Hum Ha, 2002) * Feed the Kitty (Hum Ha, 2003) * Mad Giants of Jazz (Hum Ha, 2005) * Wild Candy (Hum Ha, 2005) * Groove Detroit (Hum Ha, 2006) * West Side (Hum Ha, 2006) * Detroit Bohemia Live (Hum Ha, 2007) * Bim Huis Live 1st Set (Hum Ha, 2008) * Eat Shit @ Churchill's (Hum Ha, 2009) * No Mor Musik (ugEXPLODE, 2010) * Millions of Bastards (Hum Ha, 2010) * Screams in Brooklyn (Hum Ha, 2011) * Cum and Jizz (Florida Noise Ordinance, 2012) * Weapon (MuteAnt Sounds, 2013) * Yo Honkies (MuteAnt Sounds, 2013) * I Died for Your Sins (Hum Ha, 2014) * Elephants Fucking (Hum Ha, 2014) * Making Recordings Are B.S.

Early life and family Darbishire was born in London, the son of Colonel C. H. Darbishire of Plas Mawr, Penmaenmawr in North Wales. He was educated at Giggleswick School in Yorkshire. In 1905 he married Frances Middleton whose father had been Sheriff, or local judge, in Fort William, Scotland. Darbishire served as a volunteer member of the armed forces. He was a member of the Artists Rifles between 1897 and 1899 and the Royal Welch Fusiliers, Territorial Force from 1905‚Äì08, attaining the rank of Lieutenant.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Far East connections Darbishire went into the trading business. He was associated with the East India merchant trade and had particular connections with Malaya and Singapore. He became one of the managing directors of Paterson Simons & Co, which traded between London, the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States. He became an acknowledged expert on trade with area and contributed the chapter on Commerce and Currency to the book One Hundred Years of Singapore: being some account of the capital of the Straits Settlements from its foundation by Sir Stamford Raffles on 6 February 1819 to the 6 February 1919 which was published in 1921. Public service in Singapore Darbishire lived in Singapore for some years and became involved in public and military service there as well as commercial life. He served as a member of the Municipal Commission of Singapore from 1908‚Äì10, was an unofficial Member of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements from 1910‚Äì19 and a member of the Singapore Harbour Board between 1910 and 1919. He was also Chairman of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce from 1914‚Äì19. He carried on his volunteer soldiering in Singapore and was Officer Commanding the Singapore Volunteer Rifles from 1914‚Äì1919, with the rank of temporary Major. In February and March 1915 he was involved in the operations to suppress the Singapore Mutiny. In 1921-22 he was President of the Association of British Malaya, a pressure group formed to represent planting, mining and commercial interests in the Malay states.National Library of Singapore: Liberal politics In 1922, Darbishire was adopted as the Liberal candidate for the Wiltshire constituency of Westbury. Although the seat had been represented by both Conservatives and Liberals over the years, since it became a county seat in 1885 it had been Liberal for most of the time. At the 1918 general election a Coalition Conservative, Brigadier-General George Palmer had received the government ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô, the official letter of endorsement from Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the Conservative leader Bonar Law. Darbishire won the election of 1922 standing as a Liberal, defeating Palmer in a three-cornered contest.The Times, 6.11.22 The 1923 General Election At the next election however, Darbishire was in more difficulty. Although Westbury could be termed a traditional Liberal seat (unusually for Wiltshire) resting on foundations of Nonconformism and the Liberal tradition, the character of the seat was changing with industrialisation. The new Unionist candidate, Captain Shaw, seemed more in tune with the times than the old one and Darbishire probably suffered by his refusal to support the call for protectionism in motor tyre production made to him by workers in the industry locally. There was high unemployment amongst workers in the rubber industry in Melksham and Bradford on Avon. Elsewhere in the country the traditional Liberal policy of Free Trade was helping to re-unite the party and was proving a popular policy. In Westbury however it seemed less convincing to commentators on Liberal election prospects against the poor economic and industrial background in the area. Labour obviously tried to capitalise upon this situation and took the decision to abandon campaigning in Chippenham to concentrate on Westbury.The Times, 24.11.23 They took votes from Darbishire but not enough to deprive him of the seat. At the 1924 general election however Unionist prospects were altogether brighterThe Times, 15.10.24 and in another three-cornered contest, Darbishire lost out to Captain Shaw. Death Darbishire did not get the chance to contest any more Parliamentary elections. He died aged 49 in Singapore general hospital in June 1925, having been taken ill a few days earlier. He had been taking a tour of the Far East travelling with his wife and had arrived in Singapore from Siam (as Thailand was then known).The Times, 6.6.25 ReferencesExternal links * Category:1875 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Businesspeople from London Category:People educated at Giggleswick School Category:UK MPs 1922‚Äì1923 Category:UK MPs 1923‚Äì1924 Category:Royal Welch Fusiliers officers ","title":"Charles Darbishire"},{"id":"18042963","text":"The Platinum Collection is the third greatest hits/compilation album released by English boy-band Blue.

It is stationed at Osan Air Base, South Korea as a Geographically Separated Unit (GSU). The squadron is the fifth oldest United States Air Force squadron, its history dating to 5 May 1917 as the World War I 5th Aero Squadron. The squadron operates Lockheed U-2 aircraft conducting reconnaissance and surveillance missions. It carries out missions for U.S. Forces Korea, United States Pacific Command, Air Combat Command, along with other national authorities through the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There are approximately 200 personnel assigned to the 5 RS. HistoryWorld War I= DH-4 at Souther Field Georgia 1918 The 5th Reconnaissance Squadron's origins unofficially begin before the United States entry into World War I. In December 1916 the squadron was first organized as an un- designated unit at Rockwell Field, California, it being the fifth Aero Squadron authorized by the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps.Hennessey, pp. 165, 192 After flight training, the squadron was formally organized on 5 May 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas where it performed flight training duties.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 32‚Äì33 It was transferred to the new Souther Field, Americus, Georgia in April 1918 where it joined the 116th, 236th and 237th Aero Squadrons as Curtiss JN-4D flight training squadrons. Souther Field was one of thirty-two Air Service training camps established after the United States entry into World War I in April 1917. It consisted of warehouses, barracks, fifteen hangars and other structures. Eventually over eighty JN-4s were used for training. In July 1918, as part of a re-organization of training squadrons in the United States, it was disbanded and replaced by Squadron \\"A\\", Souther Field which continued the flight training mission.Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the World War, Vol. 3 The flying training at Souther Field continued until November 1919 when the War Department deactivated the field and sold its surplus airplanes to the public. One of the planes was sold to Charles Lindbergh who bought a JN-4 with a brand-new OX-5 engine, and an extra 20 gallon gasoline tank in May 1923. =Inter-war period= A new 5th squadron was established after World War I as part of the permanent United States Army Air Service in 1919. Authorized as the 5th Aero Squadron at Hazelhurst Field, New York, it was assigned to the 3d Observation Group. The squadron was equipped with war surplus Dayton-Wright DH-4Bs. The squadron moved to Mitchel Field, New York the following month. In 1921, the unit became the 5th Squadron (Observation) and two years later the 5th Observation Squadron.History of the 5th Reconnaissance Squadron, 5 May 1917 to 31 December 1998. Prepared by the 9th Reconnaissance Wing History Office, Beale AFB, California In May 1921, the 5th was attached to General Billy Mitchell's 1st Provisional Air Brigade at Langley Field, Virginia. From May to October 1921, the squadron and other units of the Air Brigade bombed battleships off the eastern seaboard. Mitchell was determined to prove airplanes could sink warships. In July, in the well known SMS Ostfriesland incident, brigade airplanes sunk a modern, German-made battleship. General Mitchell proclaimed the era of battleships had ended and the age of airpower had begun. On 1 August 1922, the 5th Observation Squadron joined with the 1st Observation Squadron to form the 9th Observation Group, today's 9th Operations Group and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing's predecessor. In 1928, the Army attached the 99th Observation Squadron to the 9th Observation Group and assigned the squadron to the group the following year. Throughout the 1920s and early 1930s the 5th flew routine observation and training missions and participated in air shows. Squadron pilots flew a variety of World War I-vintage aircraft, including the DH-4, O-1, O-2, A-3, B-6, and several others. In the mid-1930s, as tensions increased in Europe, the United States began to expand its air arm. On 1 March 1935, the Army re-designated the 5th Observation Squadron as the 5th Bombardment Squadron. Soon after the re- designation, the squadron received new Martin B-10 bombers. The B-10, a small bomber best suited for coastal defense, could out-fly the best Army pursuit plane of its day. In 1938, the 5th switched to the larger Douglas B-18 Bolo. =World War II= Sixth Air Force By November 1940 German U-boats actively patrolled waters off Central America near the Panama Canal. The Army dispatched the 9th Bomb Group to guard the canal. The 5th Bombardment Squadron deployed to Rio Hato Army Air Base, Panama with that Group on 13 November 1940, at which time it was designated as the 5th Bombardment Squadron (Medium), this being changed to (Heavy) five days later.Hagdedorn Two B-18A Bolos of the unit made \\"training flights\\" through Central America commencing 12 January 1941, flying from Albrook Field in the Panama Canal Zone. Their route took them first to San Jose, Costa Rica, then to San Salvador, El Salvador, Guatemala City, Managua, Nicaragua and thence back to David Field, Panama and home to Rio Hato. Major General Sanderford Jarman, Commander of the Panama Coast Artillery Command, was a VIP passenger on this flight which gave the crews excellent familiarity with airfields, flight conditions and navigational problems unique to the Caribbean. The Squadron received a single Boeing B-17B Flying Fortress to augment its four B-18As by 25 August 1941 and, on 28 September 1941, deployed to Beane Field, St. Lucia, in the Antilles, from Rio Hato. By January 1942, unit strength at Beane Field consisted of but four B-18A's and a single B-18, where the unit was attached as an clement of the Trinidad Base Command. In May 1942, the Squadron was formally assigned to the Antilles Air Task Force/Antilles Air Command, still at Beane Field, and, in October 1942 the squadron was relieved of its mission and ordered back to the United States at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida. Its personnel and B-18s were reassigned to other units. At Orlando AAF, the squadron was re-manned and re-equipped with B-24 Liberators was assigned to the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics, training aircrews in advanced combat tactics. For the next sixteen months, squadron pilots developed new tactics, tested equipment, perfected glide bombing techniques, and trained crews in high-altitude precision bombing. Eventually the squadron received B-17 Flying Fortresses, B-25 Mitchells and B-26 Invaders as part of the training program. B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan In February 1944, the 5th was again transferred, without personnel and equipment to Dalhart Army Airfield, Texas then to McCook Army Airfield, Nebraska. At McCook Field, the 5th and its sister squadrons received new Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. Squadron crews spent the next six months training in their new airplane. When training was completed, moved to North Field Tinian in the Mariana Islands of the Central Pacific Area in January 1945 and assigned to XXI Bomber Command, Twentieth Air Force. Its mission was the strategic bombardment of the Japanese Home Islands and the destruction of its war-making capability. It flew \\"shakedown\\" missions against Japanese targets on Moen Island, Truk, and other points in the Carolines and Marianas. The squadron began combat missions over Japan on 25 February 1945 with a firebombing mission over Northeast Tokyo. The squadron continued to participate in wide area firebombing attack, but the first ten- day blitz resulting in the Army Air Forces running out of incendiary bombs. Until then the squadron flew conventional strategic bombing missions using high explosive bombs. Re-equipped with incendiary bombs, the squadron returned to attack Tokyo's wooden structures that housed Japan's war industry, American bombers kept up a relentless attack on Japanese aircraft factories, chemical plants, naval bases, and airdromes throughout the final months of the war. Despite stiff opposition ‚Äì heavy and light antiaircraft fire, search lights, flak boats, and fighter planes ‚Äì squadron aircraft inflicted heavy damage on Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, Tokyo, and other cities. Conditions were so difficult on two of the missions the squadron earned Distinguished Unit Citations. First, on 15‚Äì16 April 1945, the 5th and other 9th Bomb Group units attacked the industrial area of Kawasaki, Japan. Kawasaki provided vital components for Tokyo and Yokohama's industry. Strategically located, Kawasaki's industrial area was heavily defended, both on the flanks and surrounding the target area. This made the approach, bomb run, and breakaway extremely hazardous. Adding to the danger, squadron pilots flew the 1,500 miles from Tinian to Japan low- level, over water, at night. Severe turbulence along the way affected the mechanical navigation equipment, but the bombers held their course. Attacking according to the bombing plan, the 5th Bomb Squadron was in the last run over the target. By then the Japanese defenders were fully alerted and knew the approximate bombing altitude and direction of the attack. Exceptionally close coordination between the enemy searchlights and antiaircraft guns subjected the bombers to powerful concentrations of antiaircraft fire on their way to the target, over the target, and after their breakaway. Intense, accurate fire from flak boats on the flight to and from the target caused more damage. Approximately 56 Japanese fighters attacked the 5th and its two sister squadrons. The American strike destroyed Kawasaki's industry, but the squadrons of the 9th Bomb Group paid a heavy price. Four of the group's 33 B-29s crashed during the mission. Six other sustained heavy damage. The squadron won a second Distinguished Unit Citation the following month. Effectively mining the Shimonoseki Straits and the waters around the harbors of northwest Honshu and Kyushu would block sea traffic on the Inland Seas and isolate important northern ports. By laying mines in the seas around Japan, the Allies hoped to isolate Japan's main islands and deprived them of resources from conquered territories in China, Manchuria, and Korea. The mines would also prevent reinforcement of Japanese-held islands. The squadron continued attacking urban areas with incendiary raids until the end of the war in August 1945, attacking major Japanese cities, causing massive destruction of urbanized areas. It also conducted raids against strategic objectives, bombing aircraft factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, and other targets in Japan. The squadron flew its last combat missions on 14 August, when hostilities ended. Afterwards, its B-29s carried relief supplies to Allied prisoner of war camps in Japan and Manchuria. The squadron was largely demobilized on Tinian during the fall of 1945. Remained in Western Pacific, assigned to Twentieth Air Force. Moved to Clark Field in the Philippines on 15 April 1946. It relocated to Harmon Field on Guam on 9 June 1947, by which time it was largely a paper organization with few personnel or aircraft. The squadron was inactivated on Guam on 20 October 1948. =Strategic Air Command= Strategic bombardment Following World War II, the National Security Act of 1947 established the U.S. Air Force as a sister service of the Army and Navy. The concurrent establishment of major commands within the Air Force brought wholesale realignments, including creating new wings with subordinate groups and squadrons. The Air Force established the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing on 25 April 1949 and activated it on 1 May. The Air Force also activated and redesignated the 9th Bomb Group and its subordinate squadrons, making them the 9th Reconnaissance Group, and the 1st, 5th and 99th Reconnaissance Squadrons. The 5th Reconnaissance Squadron's new home was Fairfield-Suisan (later Travis) AFB, California. For the next 11 months, squadron crewmembers flew RB-29s on visual, photographic, electronic, and weather reconnaissance missions. On 1 April 1950, the Air Force again redesignated the 9th Wing and its subordinate squadrons. The squadron again became the 5th Bomb Squadron. In February 1951 the Air Force placed all flying squadrons directly under the wing. On 19 June 1952 the 9th Bomb Group inactivated. The 5th continued to fly B-29s from Fairfield-Suisun AFB until 1 May 1953. After the Strategic Air Command assumed jurisdiction over Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, the Air Force Moved the 9th Bomb Wing there. The following year, B-47 \\"Stratojets\\" replaced the 5ths B-29s. For the next twelve years, the squadron served as an important element in the Strategic Air Command's nuclear deterrent force. Massive retaliation became a cornerstone of national policy and an effective deterrent to perceived threats. Crewmemebers trained and practiced incessantly to achieve and maintain the high state of readiness needed to fulfill their demanding and vital mission. They then spent alternating weeks in Alert Sites, ready to launch their bombers at a moment's notice. For its role in testing a new deputy-commander organizational concept to improve America's immediate retaliatory strike capability, the 5th received an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 1958. It maintained alert during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.  Strategic Reconnaissance By 1966, however, the B-47 was obsolete, replaced by the newer, larger B-52 Stratofortress. On 25 Bomb Wing and its subordinate units inactivated at Mountain Home AFB. Although the 9th immediately activated at Beale AFB, California as the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, only the 1st and 99th squadrons activated with it. When the 9th Wing moved to Beale AFB in 1966, it became the parent organization for the SR-71 \\"Blackbird.\\" Ten years later the U-2 \\"DragonLady\\" joined the 9th. The wing was the home for both America's high altitude, manned, reconnaissance aircraft. In 1986, the 5th activated and rejoined the 9th as the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Training Squadron. The squadron recruited, screened, and trained U-2 pilots to fly operational missions around the world. Because the U-2 is so unique and difficult to fly, the instructor-to-student ratio was one-to-one. For the next four years, 5th pilots taught students at Beale AFB and also flew operational missions around the world. When the Air Force removed the SR-71 from active service in 1990, however, U-2 pilot training moved to the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron and the 5th again inactivated. =From the 1990s in Korea= On 1 October 1994, the 5 RS was reactivated as a subordinate unit to the 9th Operations Group, 9th Reconnaissance Wing, at Beale Air Force Base, California. It replaced the 9th Reconnaissance Wing's Detachment 2 at Osan AB, Korea. Detachment 2, the \\"Blackcats,\\" had operated from Osan AB since 1976. The 5th had a \\"real world\\" mission-flying classified reconnaissance in Korea and the Far East. In 1995 the 5th RS was the first unit to have the new U-2S model aircraft fully operational and on 20 October 1995, Lieutenant Colonel Charles P. Wilson II flew the first ever U-2S operational mission. Additionally, in 1995 the U-2 flew the 2000th Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System mission. The squadron was the recipient of the 1995 Lockheed Advanced Development Corporation Hughes Trophy, distinguishing the unit as Best Reconnaissance Squadron in the 9th Reconnaissance Wing and was also nominated for the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. Since 1976, the unit has flown more than 7,000 operational sorties, utilizing an integrated suite of all-weather Multi- spectral image sensors. The unit has maintained a 98 percent mission effectiveness rating, despite challenging weather and a long logistics trail. Significant past events include the 1976 Korean Demilitarized Zone \\"tree cutting\\" incident in which two U.S. officers lost their lives. The unit provided continuous coverage of the area during the tense period that followed. Since 1976, surge operations have been conducted many times due to heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. In 1987, President Chun Doo-hwan visited the detachment to honor the unit for its outstanding contribution to the security of the country. In addition to its real world mission, the unit has flown humanitarian sorties to assess ROK environmental concerns, such as flood damage, and assist the Philippines in surveying the devastation caused by the Mount Pinatubo eruption.

Church of San Giacomo History The site on which the church was built in 1402 was originally the site of an old hospice, dedicated to St. James, as attested in a document of Pope Innocent III in 1210. The hospice and its chapel were passed on the Servite Order by bishop Paperone de' Paperoni in 1273. They transformed the main hall of the hospice into a church. The present church was built in 1402 under Prior Filippo di Massiolo da Foligno, incorporating the older church at its crossing. This was probably largely financed by Ugolino III Trinci, the lord of Foligno. The church was modified in the 17th and 18th centuries. The earthquake of 1997 badly damaged the church; restoration of the church was finished in 2000. The Servite Order remained with a small presence in Foligno until 1994 but their convent had been closed in 1860. The Gothic fa√ßade with its white and red bands and large window has remained unfinished. One enters the church through a beautiful ogival portal. Two inscriptions flank the portal, one records the enlargement of the church in 1402, while the other shows the arms of the Servites. Main altar The lower part of the campanile was built at the same time, but the upper part was rebuilt in the 17th century. The three-naved interior was redecorated in Baroque style during the period 1721-1729. The presbytery was rebuilt by the bishop Luca Cibo. He also probably added the cupola around 1490. The main altar stands before a construction with five winged angels on top of the gilded columns. The three statues behind the altar represent the Grieving Madonna flanked by the apostles James the Great and James the Less and were sculpted by Antonio Calcioni in 1702. Banner of \\"St. Roch and the Redeemer\\" There are several works of art over the side altars. The first side altar on the left is dedicated to St. Roche and was constructed in the period 1480-1485 to thank the saint for protecting the city during the plague that affected the city in 1476-81. The processional banner over the altar, attributed to Pierantonio Mezzastris, depicts St. Roch commending the people of Foligno to the Redeemer. It was first used in procession in 1481. Adjoining the church is a cloister with two arcades on top of each other. The lower arcade dates from 1442-1454, while the upper arcade is an addition from the 17th century. The lunettes of the lower arcade show the damaged frescoes by Giovan Battista Michelini, Il Folignate depicting scenes from the life of San Filippo Benizi (1611), a canonized general superior of the Servites. The Chapter Room retains the original windows of the ancient hospice. The sacristy of the church stands on the same spot as the chapel of the old hospice.

The party campaigned on a wide range of issues but principally on the more vigorous promotion of a bypass for the town of Boston, Lincolnshire. The party contested all 32 seats, winning 25 to become the first party to take overall control of the council since the borough was formed in 1974. By autumn 2008, the party had 18 borough councillors remaining, after losing four members in defections to the Better Boston Group, one to become an independent, and two in by-elections. Following the 2011 local elections, the party was almost wiped out completely. In July 2009, the Audit Commission said, in an assessment covering the period from 2004 to 2009, that the council gave poor value for money for taxpayers. That period included 3 years of the previous administration's term of office and only 2 under the BBI. The most recent report from the Audit Commission, in February 2010, judged Boston as a 'fair' Council. In 2008, leader Richard Austin helped found a county-wide party, \\"Lincolnshire Independents ‚Äì Lincolnshire First!\\". In 2012, the party was renamed as the Boston District Independents. Formation The Boston Bypass Independent Party was formed in September 2006. The bypass issue had already generated two campaign groups, the Boston & District Bypass Pressure Group (BBPG) and the Boston Bypass & Economic Growth Pressure Group (BBEG), and the BBI hoped to give this campaign a political element. Additionally the party hoped to re-invigorate local politics in the town which were perceived to have stagnated with several councillors elected unopposed. The BBI group were partly inspired by the success of the Kidderminster Hospital Campaign, which won 16 of the seats on Wyre Forest District Council in 2004. Electoral performanceBoston Borough Council elections, 2007= The party's slogan for the 2007 local elections was \\"Getting Boston Moving\\". Boston had no opposition group as all the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and independent councillors were represented in a joint administration, meaning that public discontent over traffic congestion was directed at all the existing councillors. The Boston Bypass Independents won the election in a landslide victory with 25 seats, the first party to take overall control since the borough was formed in 1972. All the Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors lost their seats, with only five Conservatives and two Independents elected. =2008 by-elections= One councillor stood down in June 2008 when he was convicted of drink driving. The party lost the subsequent by-election in Coastal ward on 25 July 2008 to the Conservative candidate. Another by-election in Fenside ward on 13 November 2008 saw the party lose another seat to the British National Party, on a 22% turnout. =2009 County Council election= In the Lincolnshire County Council election on 4 June 2009, party leader Richard Austin lost his Boston South seat to the Conservative candidates, but Ray Newell took the Boston West seat from Labour. =Boston Borough Council elections, 2011= In May 2011 the BBI were defeated by the Conservatives with 14 of the remaining 18 Boston Bypass Independents losing their seats. =Name change= In August 2011, the name of the party was changed from the BBI to the Boston District Independents \\"to shake off its image as the ‚Äòbypass party‚Äô\\". Finances According to its Electoral Commission records, the party had income of ¬£6,639 (including ¬£460 subscriptions), and expenditure of ¬£6,248, for the year 2007, in which it contested the local council elections. In the year 2006, it had an income of ¬£656, and an expenditure of ¬£340.Statement of accounts 2007 Better Boston Group The Better Boston Group is a political group that split from the Boston Bypass Independents in October 2007 under the leadership Cllr Anne Dorrian. She had unsuccessfully stood for leadership of the BBI group after their landslide victory in April 2007. It has four councillors on Boston Borough Council. Cllr Brian Rush, the other unsuccessful candidate for Party leadership in April 2007, of the group said of the Boston Bypass Independents that \\"We came in on a typhoon and we are nothing more than a gentle breeze now. It appears to me that we haven't done anything yet. There is nothing that I can put my hand on and say the BBI have thought of that, the inspiration was there and they have carried it through.\\" The group criticised the record of the BBI, including their approval of the Lincolnshire County Council Transport Strategy for Boston. A deal with the county council was struck to aid the BBI with the bypass proposal if they agreed not to stand in the next county council elections, prompting two councillors to resign. The chairman of the Boston Bypass Pressure Group also called on Cllr Austin and his deputy, Cllr Peter Jordan to resign over the deal with Lincolnshire Council. Both Cllrs Austin and Jordan vigorously denied any such deal and there were four BBI candidates in the subsequent County Council elections in 2009.

FEED is an impact-driven lifestyle brand, making products that help feed the children of the world. For every product to accessory bought, school meals are donated to children in need here in America and across the globe. Instead of talking about percentages, FEED transparently labels each of their products with a number. THE NUMBER equals how many school meals your purchase helps provide. History FEED was founded by Lauren Bush-Lauren (granddaughter of George H.W. Bush and wife of David Lauren) in 2007, with a mission to end childhood hunger through fashion and design. Lauren‚Äôs idea was to create a tangible, shareable, way to show consumers their impact, by stamping a number on every product that represents the school meals donated by their purchase. She was inspired by her travels as a student ambassador with the World Food Programme, and wanted to find a way to raise funds and awareness around the issue of hunger. Combining fashion and philanthropy, she designed her first product, the FEED 1 Bag. In 2012, FEED Projects is listed as a partner of the (RED) campaign, together with other brands such as Nike, Girl, American Express and Converse. The campaign's mission is to prevent the transmission of the HIV virus from mother to child by 2015 (the campaign's byline is \\"Fighting For An AIDS Free Generation\\"). In July 2019, FEED Projects signed a partnership with Ralph Lauren on a capsule collection. IN May 2020, FEED Projects signed a partnership with Clarins to sell limited-edition bags filled with products from the cosmetics brand.  Description  FEED is an impact-driven lifestyle brand, making products that help feed the children of the world. FEED has provided more than 110 million meals to date globally through the World Food Programme and domestically through Feeding America and No Kid Hungry. The number on the product signifies that for every bag sold, one child in school for one year will be provided with school meals. Every FEED product has a number on it, which indicates the number of school meals provided with that purchase. There are a variety of FEED products available for purchase on the FEED website, with new collections launched seasonally, as well as in person, at the FEED Shop & Cafe in DUMBO, Brooklyn. FEED bags are sold in a variety of models, including duffel bags, backpacks, and totes. Every single product provides school meals when purchased, represented by the number stamped on each bag or accessory. The meals are distributed by the brand's giving partners, the UN World Food Programme (global giving) and No Kid Hungry (US giving). One of the first bags, The FEED 1 bag, provides one child with a year's worth of meals (185 school meals).

His then for-profit company, Disaster Recovery Solutions LLC, operated on the highly profitable debris removal contracts working in the aftermath of large- scale disasters. Typically, Agoglia and his crew wouldn‚Äôt start their work in the ravaged communities until months after the initial devastation, after the contracts had been finalized.

He left Missouri with his equipment from his LLC, and started toward what was left of Greensburg. Greensburg‚Äôs already limited resources were either destroyed or inaccessible to its firefighters and the town was in desperate need for Agoglia‚Äôs uniquely specialized equipment. Fortuitously, Agoglia had brought the exact machinery needed to clear the roads of debris and power lines, and helping the firefighters access their firehouse and equipment. Agoglia spent weeks in Greensburg, assisting families to clear debris from their home sites. From that Greensburg storm moving forward, Agoglia and his Team travelled from one disaster zone to the next, offering their assistance to every community they could, for no charge. The first 2 years of the not-for-profit work operated using over $1 million worth of equipment from Disaster Recovery Solutions LLC and also from Agoglia‚Äôs personal life‚Äôs savings of over $1 million; a pocket of wealth earned not solely from the LLC, but also first pennies earned since he started working at just 12 years old. Responding pro bono to 18 communities in those 2 years, Agoglia felt fulfilled but was financially depleted. Entering the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, it was poor timing to launch an official non-profit dependent on donor assistance. In planning a more specialized fleet for the newly founded charity, Agoglia went to a Peterbilt dealership in Baltimore, with the intentions of buying a new truck. He met the dealership President, John Arscott, who was inspired by his story. In the midst of the recession, he insisted that Agoglia take 3 Peterbilt trucks of his choosing for only the promise that one day, John and his sons could join Agoglia in a response. Presently, Agoglia‚Äôs organization relies on individual and private donations to continue responding to communities across the US affected by large-scale disasters. In 2008, Agoglia was chosen as a CNN Top Ten Hero of the Year and featured as People Magazine‚Äôs Heroes Among Us. In 2010, Agoglia was presented with the Jefferson Award for Public Service and recognized in GQ Magazine‚Äôs Better Men Better World Search. In 2015, Agoglia was awarded the Extraordinary Commitment of Service to the Community Award by the RUMI Forum of Washington, DC. Agoglia and his organization have received recognition from MSNBC, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, PBS, USA Today, U.S. News & World Report, Good Morning America, and Men‚Äôs Health, among many others. First Response Team of America From its inception until presently (2015), the FRTA has responded to 84 communities in the US and to Haiti for the 2010 earthquake. The Team specializes in confined space search and rescue, swift water rescue, powering critical infrastructure, and quick-response debris removal. The organization derived from Agoglia's previous business, Disaster Recovery Solutions LLC, a crane company that operated on debris removal government contracts after large-scale disasters. In May 2007, Disaster Recovery Solutions was working a contracting job in Missouri when an EF-5 tornado leveled the town of Greensburg, Kansas, destroying 95% of the community. The town's limited resources were destroyed and/or inaccessible to its firefighters and the town was in need of specialized heavy equipment. Agoglia left the contract job in Missouri and brought machinery to clear the roads of debris and power lines, helping the firefighters access their firehouse and equipment. In the following days and weeks, home sites and crucial buildings were cleared for families and the community.  References  * 2008 CNN Heroes.

History Alan White had achieved success in his role as the drummer with Yes, as well as having worked with John Lennon, George Harrison and Joe Cocker. He had previously worked with two Seattle-based bands, MerKaBa and Treason (including guesting on Treason's eponymous 1997 album). Alan White and Treason keyboardist Ted Stockwell began working with MerKaBa on a new album, with Treason's guitarist, Karl Haug, subsequently becoming involved. The MerKaBa identity was dropped and the band took on the new name of White. An album was completed in mid-2004 with Stockwell on keys to have been called New Day (tracks: \\"Fate\\", \\"The Way You See Me\\", \\"DreamAway\\", \\"New Day\\", \\"Shine\\", \\"Up\\", \\"Loyal\\", \\"Rite of Rain\\", \\"Mighty Love\\", \\"Burn All the Maps\\", \\"Waterhole (I'll Come Around)\\") and the band played a small number of live dates in the Seattle area. However, the band and Stockwell split and the album was not released. Geoff Downes, who had previously worked with Alan White in Yes, joined in April 2005 and the entire album was re-recorded, re-working songs from New Day and adding new material. The More Drama Tour, a joint tour, with White, The Syn, Steve Howe and a joint set with Howe, Squire and White together, was planned for 2005, but belatedly cancelled. The album White was released in 2006, with Alan White, Kevin Currie, Steve Boyce, Karl Haug and Geoff Downes. Occasional live work followed, but Downes left the band given other commitments. The band continued, with a number of replacement keyboardists, including Phil Davis. Former MerKaBa member, Richard \\"Wayo\\" Hogan, also worked with them in 2006. After a period of inactivity, White returned with a new line-up and occasional live work, again in the Seattle area, in September 2010. The current line-up retains Alan White (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Karl Haug (guitars, backing vocals) and Steve Boyce (bass, guitar, backing vocals), who are now joined by two musicians from the Yes tribute band Parallels (who have previously worked with Alan White): Robyn Dawn (vocals) and Jonathan Sindelman (keys).

Women's Erotic Emporium is a British sex shop, founded and run by women for women. Its premises in the East End of London and its website sell sex toys, strap-on harnesses, dildos, bondage gear, lingerie, books, DVDs and accessories. Founded in 1992 by Kathryn Hoyle and Sophie Walters, the company also manufactures dildos and harnesses, and commissions BDSM equipment, lubricant, massage oil, toy cleaner and vibrating toys. The Sh! shop is located in Hoxton Square, London. A second shop, on Portobello Road, ceased trading in May 2012. The company also runs a mail order business with headquarters in Forest Gate. Sh! is a small company, employing nine women. Founders' biographies Kathryn Hoyle was born in Ilkley, West Yorkshire and grew up with a feminist mother, a free-thinking father and one brother. She attended her local school, Ilkley Grammar, before going on to complete a foundation art course in Bradford and graduating with a degree in Fine Art from The Faculty of Arts and Architecture, Brighton University. Sophie Walters was born in Bracknell, Berkshire and went to Marist Convent Catholic School in Sunninghill, Berkshire. At 17, she started a business and commerce course at Windsor College. Upon completion of the course Walters worked for Securicor Heathrow, Air Courier Division and later on for Roy Bowles Transport & Cargo. In 1989, she took up the position of Logistics Manager at Sony Corporation Air Cargo and then, after meeting Hoyle in 1991, joined Sh! Cultural impact Sh! was the first sex shop in the UK focusing solely on women. Sex shops were created to cater mainly to men's needs. One of the effects of the sexual revolution was that women took charge of their own sexuality, and with that have pushed into the sex business. However, in late 2014, the company changed its door policy regarding male customers; previously men had to be accompanied by a female to enter the store and browse. Since October 2014 the lower floor of the premises is open to all customers, including unaccompanied men, while the upper floor remains women-only. Vibrators were first developed in the 19th century as medical equipment to help cure women of hysteria by inducing hysterical paroxysm, also known as orgasm. Many medical practitioners working with sexual dysfunctions have limited or no knowledge of vibrators or dildos, so Sh! has been working to educate practitioners from NHS Trusts. The Sh! website provides advice and guidance, and the shop offers customers to opportunity to handle various toys or to speak to highly trained staff. The company is the only sex shop which offers a 30-day warranty. Hoyle discovered the Rabbit vibrator in a sex toy warehouse in 1992. It was named \\"Roger Rabbit\\", but her renamed version, the \\"Jessica Rabbit\\", has since gone on to fame, starring in television shows including Sex and the City. However, it was in 1999, when Cosmopolitan ran an article on female masturbation, that the \\"Jessica\\" really started to enter women's homes. Pornography and sex shop licensing Sh! stocks women- friendly pornographic material, such as films by Anna Span. Women-friendly means depicting female desire convincingly and realistically, as opposed to mainstream pornography which embodies the male gaze and objectifies women by making them into a tool for both the male pornographic actor's sexual gratification and the viewer's purposes. The pornography which Sh! stocks is softcore - that is, having any explicit money shots and genitalia blurred or pixelated. This is due to the premises not having the appropriate licensing to stock hardcore pornography. Projects Sh! runs educational workshops and collaborates with National Health Service Trusts in providing sex toys for women with sexual difficulties. This includes a dilator set, composed of vibrators of varying diameters. The Sh! dilator set is also part of a PhD project, at The Royal United Hospital Bath Gynae Oncology department, to research the possibilities and implications of using vibrators in the post- surgery dilating process for women. 2003 International Sexology Conference In 2003, Adeola Agbebiyi from the Barts and the London NHS Trust, and Kathryn Hoyle and Angel Zatorski both from Sh! Women's Emporium, presented two papers exploring the relationship between women and sex toys. Sh! Sex Toy Workshops Sh! wrote the introduction to sex toys and safer sex for the Oxford University Student Guide. Books Sh! is one of three remaining women's bookstores in London and has a comprehensive selection of women's erotica and books dealing with women's sexuality and related issues. Awards Sh! has been awarded Ethical Consumer status by ethicalconsumer.org for their informed and information-giving standpoint on sex toys. Sh! has also won the 2005 Erotic Awards Special Judges Award for being 'the best sex shop in town ~ possibly the world!' In 2007, Sh! was named in the g3 magazine Readers' Poll as 'Best adult store online' and 'Best LBGT friendly business'. In 2008 the business was awarded the Readers' Poll 'Best online retailer' award.g3 magazine, June 2008 In March 2012 Sh! was awarded the UK & Ireland Shopping Venue of the Year, and the UK & Ireland Best Business of the Year, at the first annual Qype Business awards.

It is a painting traditionally attributed to Francisco de Goya that shows a giant in the centre of the canvas walking towards the left hand side of the picture. Mountains obscure his legs up to his thighs and clouds surround his body; the giant appears to be adopting an aggressive posture as he is holding one of his fists up at shoulder height. A dark valley containing a crowd of people and herds of cattle fleeing in all directions occupies the lower third of the painting. The painting became the property of Goya's son, Javier Goya, in 1812.According to Nigel Glendinning (op. cit., 1993, p. 140.) the painting \\"was painted between that date [1808] and 1812, when the painting was included in an inventory of possessions that became the property of the painter's son, Javier Goya, after the death of his mother, Josefa Bayeu. The painting is identified as The Giant in this inventory of goods The painting was later owned by Pedro Fern√°ndez Dur√°n, who bequeathed his collection to Madrid's Museo del Prado, where it has been kept since 1931.  History of the painting  The Giant, also called The Colossus (unnumbered print, 1814-1818). Burnished aquatint etching by Francisco de Goya, the bottom part of the print, where the title would have been inserted, has been cropped. The painting became part of the Museo del Prado's collection in 1931, when it was donated by the estate of Pedro Fern√°ndez Dur√°n. The first documented attribution of the painting to Goya dates from 1946 when Francisco Javier S√°nchez Cant√≥n published the inventory of the estate of Josefa Bayeu, Goya's wife, on her death in 1812. The inventory describes a painting of \\"a giant\\" with the same measurements as The Colossus, which was identified with an X (Xavier Goya) and the number 18. The painting was passed into the ownership of Miguel Fern√°ndez Dur√°n Fern√°ndez de Pinedo y Bizarr√≥n, Marquis of Perales, as he left it to his great-grandson, Pedro Fern√°ndez Dur√°n on his death in 1833. The painting is listed in the notarised estate of Paula Bernaldo de Quir√≥s (Marchioness of Perales and Tolosa and mother of Pedro Fern√°ndez Dur√°n) on her death in 1877. At this time the painting was described as \\"A prophetic allegory of the misfortunes that took place during the War of Independence, Goya original, measuring 1.15 by 1.[0]3 (global measurement units) ( having a value of one thousand five hundred pesetas\\". More recently, the questions raised regarding the authorship of The Colossus and its absence from the Prado's exhibition Goya in wartime have focussed attention on, among other matters, Goya's etching of the same theme, which was included in the same exhibition (exhibition catalogue number 28). In an article entitled \\"Artistic technique as a research method relating to Goya's 'The Colossus'\\" (in the journal Goya No. 324) Jesusa Vega established the relationship between the etching known as The Giant (of which there is second copy in the Spanish National Library in Madrid) and The Colossus in these words: \\"the giant, moves from resistance / defence, proud and erect, to slumped melancholy, reflecting the mood of many Spaniards, a collective feeling shared by its creator\\".Jesusa Vega, \\"La t√©cnica art√≠stica como m√©todo de conocimiento, a prop√≥sito de El Coloso de Goya\\", in Goya: Revista de arte, No. 324, January - March 2008, pages 229-44. . Dialnet [http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2714917 2714917. If the painting is attributed as being painted between 1808‚Äîthe start of the Peninsular War‚Äîand 1812‚Äîwhen the painting is recorded as being among the goods divided between Goya and his son Javier‚Äîthen the print should be dated as originating after the end of the war due to the technique and materials used in the series of etchings The Disasters of War. Drawing with the title Gran Coloso dormido (Large sleeping Giant) in Goya's handwriting. Lithographic pencil, Album G-3 or First Burdeos Album (1824-1828), former Gerstenberg collection, Berlin, and Hermitage Museum (Saint Petersburg).  Analysis  The large body of the giant occupies the centre of the composition. It appears to be adopting a fighting pose due to the position of its one visible arm and its clenched fist. The picture was painted during the Peninsular War so it could be a symbolic representation of that war. Nigel Glendinning states that the picture is based on a patriotic poem written by Juan Bautista Arriaza called Pyrenean Prophecy published in 1810.Juan Bautista Arriaza's poem \\"Profec√≠a del Pirineo\\" (vv. 25-36) refers to a Titan that roams the Pyrenees, the etymology of the range means burnt mountain, which is reflected in traditional Spanish literature, such as in The Fable of Polifemo and Galatea by Luis de G√≥ngora; the giant Polifemo is called \\"this Pyrenees\\" in verse 62. Ariaza's poem describes details such as the clouds that surround the giant's waist, which are reflected in the painting: The poem represents the Spanish people as a giant arising from the Pyrenees in order to oppose the Napoleonic invasion. Goya's painting The Eagle, which was found in the possession of Goya's son in 1836, is similar in size and allegorical character to The Colossus. Nigel Glendinning considers this proof that Goya conceived of paintings with a similar concept to The Colossus.Nigel Glendinning, \\"En torno al Coloso atribuido a Goya una vez m√°s\\", Goya. Revista de Arte, 329 (October - December 2009) , page 294. The giant's posture has been the object of a number of interpretations. It is unknown if it is walking or firmly planted with legs spread apart. The giant's position is also ambiguous, it could be behind the mountains or buried up to above its knees. The subject's legs are also obscured in Saturn Devouring His Son and the subject is even buried up to its neck--or possibly it is behind an embankment--in The Dog, which in Spanish is sometimes referred to as Perro Semihundido (Semi-submerged Dog). Some experts have suggested that the giant appears to have his eyes shut, which could represent the idea of blind violence. In contrast to the erect figure of the giant are the tiny figures in the valley that are fleeing in all directions. The only exception is a donkey that is standing still, Juan J. Luna has suggested that this figure could represent an incomprehension of the horrors of war.Juan J. Luna, \\"El coloso\\" [en l√≠nea] No. 43, in Cat√°logo de la exposici√≥n celebrada en el Museo de Zaragoza del 3 de octubre al 1 de diciembre de 1996 The technique used in this painting is similar to that used in Goya's Black Paintings, which were originally painted on the walls of Goya's house, Quinta del Sordo. A later date for the painting of the picture has even been suggested, which would mean that The Colossus mentioned in the inventory of 1812 is a different painting. However, Nigel Glendinning has refuted this later dating with arguments solely based on stylistic features of the painting. Glendinning argues that all the stylistic features found in The Colossus are already present (although not to the same degree) in Goya's previous paintings from The Meadow of San Isidro in 1788, which contains small figures painted with quick strokes; to Los Caprichos (1799) numbers 3 (Here comes the bogeyman) and 52 (What a tailor can do) for the theme of an oversized figure that is frightening.Cfr. los cited Caprichos; No. 3 Que viene el coco (Here comes the bogey-man) and No. 52 Lo que puede un sastre (What a tailor can do) As well as some drawings found in Goya's sketchbooks such as A giant figure on a balcony, A hooded giant and Proclamation Dream of the Witches (Gassier and Wilson No.s. 625, 633 and 638). Saturn Devouring His Son, one of the Black Paintings by Goya (1819‚Äì1823). A series of parallel themes also exist in Disasters of War and the eponymous unnumbered print The Giant or Colossus, dating from between 1814 and 1818, which shows a giant seated in a dark and desolate landscape with a crescent moon in the top corner. However, the giant's posture and the darkness of the night express a solitude that is different from the aggression shown in the painting and the print is not obviously related to war. It is not possible to ascertain if the giant's eyes are shut in the print, but it appears to be listening out for something. That is, the giant is doing something that perhaps Goya, who had been deaf since 1793, longed to be able to do. Or perhaps the giant's posture reflects the alert attentiveness of someone who is deaf or blind or both. What is certain is that the oil painting is stylistically similar to the Black Paintings. The colour black predominates, the touches of colour are minimalistic and applied with a spatula and the theme appears to be related to certain German works belonging to the Storm and Stress (Sturm und Drang) movement of early Romanticism. Goya's emphasis on the emotional element of the panic that has caused the chaotic flight of the populace also reflects this early Romanticist aesthetic. As does the symbolism of the giant as the incarnation of ideas of identity in the collective consciousness or Volkgeist. Especially when this consciousness is linked with aggression that was seen as coming from outside forces. These ideas arose with idealist German romanticism and they were widespread in the Europe of the early 19th century. The era's patriotic poetry, such as Pyrenean Prophecy, was known by heart by many Spaniards, including Goya, who was also friends with well-known Enlightenment writers and pre-Romantic thinkers. Juan Bautista Arriaza, author of the Pyrenean Prophecy (in Poes√≠as patri√≥ticas Patriotic Poems, 1810), probably the source of inspiration for the iconography of The Colossus. Other interpretations regarding the meaning of this painting have also been offered. Regarding the emblems, it has been suggested that the giant may represent an incompetent and arrogant Fernando VII of Spain where the mountains act to emphasise his arrogance. In addition, it has been suggested that the stationary donkey represents an ossified aristocracy that is beholden to an absolute monarchy. Studies of representations of giants in satirical cartoons of this period or of the mythical figure Hercules have suggested that the giant in the painting represents the Spanish monarchy opposing the Napoleonic regime. Investigations that have used X-ray analysis of the giant's posture have suggested that the figure is similar to the Farnese Hercules represented in etchings by Hendrick Goltzius or the Spanish Hercules painted by Francisco de Zurbar√°n in his The Labours of Hercules series, which is found among the great paintings of battles found in the Sal√≥n de Reinos in the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid. However, Glendinning has insisted that the idea of a giant is common in the patriotic poetry of the Peninsular War. The idea is prefigured in the Spanish Golden Age by the allegorical figures of the baroque theatre (The Siege of Numantia by Miguel de Cervantes contains a passage in which Spain is represented in a dialogue with the River Duero) and many of these figures are apparitions blessed by God (such as Saint James or Saint George in important battles against the Moors) in order to motivate the soldiers involved in battle. There are similar giants in Manuel Jos√© Quintana's patriotic poem To Spain, After the March Revolution, in which the giant shadows cast by such Spanish heroes as Ferdinand III of Castile, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (El Gran Capit√°n) and Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar (El Cid) urge on the resistance. In a poem by Crist√≥bal de Be√±a the shadow of James I of Aragon (Jaime I el Conquistador) is invoked for similar purposes. In the poem Zaragoza by Francisco Mart√≠nez de la Rosa, General Palafox commander of the Siege of Zaragoza (1808) is encouraged by his predecessor Rodrigo de Rebolledo. Finally, the victor in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, the king Alfonso VIII of Castile is mentioned in the hymn celebrating the Battle of Bail√©n written by Juan Bautista Arriaza. Detail of the urban landscape from the print called A Giant or The Colossus Detail of the lower part of the painting. People and animals flee in various directions, forming a dynamic composition with centrifugal lines. Despite all the aforementioned, there are still unknown elements in the painting. There is no convincing argument regarding the direction that the giant is moving in (if it is moving at all), and it is impossible to see the enemy that it is opposing. However, on the latter point some authors consider it highly likely that the mountainous terrain hides the enemy army on the other side of the valley that the civilians are fleeing along. It has therefore been proposed that the painting most probably shows a confrontation between an invading French army and the giant, representing the defending Spanish forces, as described in Ariaza's poem. The giant's willingness to fight with his bare hands and without weapons is also described by Arriaza in his poem Memories of the Second of May, \\"Recuerdos del Dos de Mayo\\", pages 61-67 which stresses the heroic nature of the Spanish nation. The giant's heroism contrasts with the fear of the rest of the population, who are fleeing and dispersing in many different directions, only pausing occasionally to help someone who has collapsed or due to the legendary stubbornness of a mule. In terms of the axis of the composition, there are a number of signals that dynamically represent the directions in which the multitude is fleeing, which is mainly towards and beyond the painting's lower left hand corner. There is another opposing axis shown by the stampede of the bulls to the right. Amongst all this movement there are some figures that are attending to a fallen person or someone in difficulty, which provides a counterpoint to the movement and emphasizes the impression of chaos. The giant is separated from the foreground by the mountains, thereby providing a feeling of depth. It is turned away and facing to the left creating a perspective further removed from the viewer and forming a diagonal opposition to the direction of the fleeing crowd. The effect of the light, which possibly indicates sunset, surrounds and highlights the clouds that encircle the giant's waist as described in Arriaza's poem: This slanting light is fractured and interrupted by the mountain peaks increasing the sensation of disequilibrium and disorder. The effect is similar to Luis de G√≥ngora's famous \\"dubious daylight\\" (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea v. 72.). Instead of a centripetal composition where all the indications point towards a central nucleus, in this painting all the lines of movement shatter the unity of the image into multiple paths towards its margins. The painting can be considered to be an example of the many Romanticist paintings with an organic composition (in this case centrifugal), in relation to the movements and actions of the figures within the painting. This can be contrasted with the mechanical compositions found in Neoclassicism, where angular axises are formed by a painting's contents and imposed by the rational will of the painter.  Attribution  Brush strokes from the bottom left hand corner of The Colossus, which Nigel Glendinning identified as two numbers (17 or 18) from an inventory (that Jesusa Vega states in \\"The Colossus is by Francisco de Goya\\" 2012, is an 18)Jesusa Vega, \\"El Coloso es de Francisco de Goya\\", Artes y Letras, suplemento de Heraldo de Arag√≥n, 19 January 2012. and Manuela Mena, at first identified, as the initials of Asensio Juli√° (A. J.), even though in January 2009 she refused to state definitively that these strokes were the signature of the Valencian painter. In June 2008 the Museo del Prado issued a press release in which Manuela Mena, Chief Curator of 18th-Century Painting and Goya, stated that the painting was \\"with almost complete certainty\\" the work of the painter Asensio Juli√° who was a friend and collaborator of Goya. The analysis undertaken in January 2009 concluded that the painting was the work of one of Goya's disciples without being able to state for certain that this person was Juli√°. The Goya expert Nigel Glendinning rejects the idea that the picture was painted by Asensio Juli√°, stating that the arguments supporting Mena's views are \\"totally subjective\\" and that the brush strokes that Mena claims are the signature \\"A. J.\\" are actually the first digits of the inventory number 176 that is visible in old photographs of the painting. It is also possible to see other numbers in these old photographs such as the number 18 that is alluded to in the sentence \\"A giant with the number eighteen\\" used in a description of the painting A Giant which was the name used for the painting in the inventory of Goya's works carried out in 1812 after the death of the painters wife Josefa Bayeu.See also page 30 of the cited article (Glendinning, 2002): In 2012 Jesusa Vega published an article entitled \\"The Colossus is by Francisco de Goya\\" in which she shows how the strokes of various figure eights drawn by Goya correspond to those visible on The Colossus. Vega rejects the basic premise that initially threw doubt on Goya's authorship of the painting. In addition, she shows that the other findings of the study carried out by the Prado have all indicated that the picture was painted by Goya; these included the analysis of pigments and binders, assessment of the artistic techniques used and the theme and composition of the painting along with its similarity to Goya's other Black Paintings. Then in 2009 the Art Historian Valeriano Bozal, after seeing Mena's press release, stated that \\"the report is not conclusive\\".\\"Bozal: \\"If I was Director of the Prado I would not remove The Colossus\\" (from the catalogue of Goya's works)\\", ABC, 28, January 2009. and he later unsuccessfully tried to hold a congress of international experts with the objective of arriving at a consensus, declaring in June 2010 that \\"Goya's authorship has been removed on the basis of weak irrelevant evidence. The heritage of the painting has been mutilated without conclusive evidence\\".\\"Arte bajo sospecha\\", El Pa√≠s, 19 June 2010. Other scholars, restorers and former directors of the Prado have indicated that they disagree with Mena's hypothesis.\\"Cuatro ex directores del Prado opinan sobre la pol√©mica de \\"El Coloso\\", ABC, 2-7-2008. \\"El Coloso une a los sabios contra la descatalogaci√≥n\\" , P√∫blico.es, 28 January 2009. \\"El informe sobre El Coloso sigue sin convencer a los especialistas\\", Heraldo de Arag√≥n, 28 January 2009. \\"El Coloso sigue en pie en Estados Unidos\\", ABC, 18-2-2009. \\"El Coloso puede acabar volviendo del exilio, como el vel√°zquez del Met\\", ABC.es, 17 November 2009. On the other side of the argument Manuela Mena refused to definitively conclude that the letters A.

Signature of Asensio Juli√° on El N√°ufrago (The Shipwreck) Ever since 2001, Juliet Bareau- Wilson and Manuela Mena have questioned Goya's authorship of the painting, postulating that Goya's son, Javier, painted it. In addition, they attribute The Milkmaid of Bordeaux to the goddaughter of painter Rosarito Weiss. However, in an article entitled The problem of the allocations from the 1900 Goya Exposition Nigel Glendinning and the then-director of the Museo del Prado, Fernando Checa, reject these claims.\\"Museum rejects Goya claims\\", BBC News, 05-04-2001.\\"La mujer que le quit√≥ 'El Coloso' a Francisco de Goya\\" , adn.es, 28 January 2009.\\"Nigel Glendinning: \\"El coloso y La lechera de Burdeos son de Goya y me enfada que lo nieguen sin demostrarlo\\"\\", ABC, 5-5-2002. In 2004 Nigel Glendinning also published an article entitled Goya's The Colossus and the patriotic poetry of its time,Nigel Glendinning, \\"El Coloso de Goya y la poes√≠a patri√≥tica de su tiempo\\", in Dieciocho: Hispanic Enlightenment vol. 27, No. 1, Queen Mary College, University of London, 22-03-2004, pages 47-58. .

[consulted 6-02-2009] establishing the relationship between Goya's ideas regarding the giant represented in the picture and the literature that aroused patriotic fervour in a population that had survived the war provoked by Napoleon's invasion of Spain. This conjunction of ideas would not have existed if The Colossus had been painted later, which is an argument that Glendinning uses to refute Bareau-Wilson and Mena's hypothesis. This hypothesis tries to distance the painting from the inventory of the estate of Goya's wife, Josefa Bayeu, on her death in 1812. The inventory lists a painting with the same dimensions as The Colossus, which is called A Giant and which has traditionally been identified as the same painting. In July 2009 Spanish universities and numerous Goya experts signed a declaration in support of Nigel Glendinning, defending the use of the scientific method in the study of art history and attributing The Colossus to Goya.

History  The library was founded in 1935 and a library building constructed at 106 W. Hadley (now 501 N. Main Street) as the result of a bequest from Mrs. Alice Branigan in memory of her husband Capt. Thomas Branigan. Its immediate predecessor was the Woman's Improvement Association library founded in 1924; this library was disbanded in 1935 when the Branigan library opened and its collection became the core of the Branigan collection. The current library building at 200 E. Picacho Avenue was constructed in 1979 on the site of the former Lucero School (1942‚Äì1963). The architects were Dean and Hunt Associates Ltd of Albuquerque. The building was dedicated December 9, 1979 The 1935 library building is now the Branigan Cultural Center and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The 1979 library was constructed in two floors, with the collection on the first floor and offices and work areas on the second floor. Beginning in 2008 part of the collection was moved to the second floor. The library is running out of space and is looking at plans for expansion and the opening of branch libraries. In July 2003 the library opened a satellite library in the Robert Munson Senior Center. Carol A. Brey-Casiano, the Library Director from 1996 to 2000, was president of the American Library Association for 2004‚Äì2005.  Services  Library cards are free to residents of Do√±a Ana County. Card holders can check out books, audio books, compact discs, videos, art prints, and magazines. Summer Reading Programs have been running since 1972 and attract about 600 to 800 children each year. A homebound delivery program began in 1973. Two bookmobiles were purchased in 1975 and service continued until 2008 when they were replaced by a books-by-mail program. Regular art exhibits are held in the Terrace Gallery on the library's second floor.

He was most famous for painting large scenes of the life of Joan of Arc in the Basilica of Bois- Chenu in Domr√©my. Life and work Lionel Royer was born in Ch√¢teau-du-Loir in Sarthe on December 25, 1852. He volunteered before his 18th birthday for the Franco-Prussian War and took part in the Battle of Loigny-Poupry on December 2, 1870 under the command of General Athanase de Charrette de la Contrie. Contrie, having noticed Royer's artistic talent, offered to finance his studies at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Royer became a pupil of Alexandre Cabanel and of William-Adolphe Bouguereau. He obtained the Prix de Rome in 1882. He became a portraitist and, especially, a painter of historical scenes. His best-known works are Vercing√©torix Throwing his Weapons at the Feet of Caesar (1899), and the decoration of the Basilica of Domr√©my dedicated to Joan of Arc. In illustrated supplements of newspapers of the era, he was a commentator on current affairs, in particular supplying drawings of Alfred Dreyfus in his prison or Auguste Comte and his three muses. Portrait of Comte d'Adh√©mar de Cransac. Oil on canvas, c. 1890, in the Dayton Art Institute In memory of his participation in the battle of Loigny, he donated two paintings to the rebuilt church of this village, the first representing the mass attended by the volunteers before leaving for the battle and the second depicting the nocturnal agony of the severely wounded General de Sonis on the battlefield. In 1897, he made a gift to the Soci√©t√© historique et arch√©ologique du Maine (of which he was a member, as was fellow artist Albert Maignan) of ten watercolors depicting the Life of Joan of Arc, which had been unsuccessful entries in a contest of 1893 for new designs for windows in Orl√©ans Cathedral. > \\"The battle scenes at Orl√©ans before the fortress or at Compi√®gne offer > Royer, the painter of historical scenes, an opportunity to demonstrate his > skill in composition, with the tangle of armour-clad bodies and the play of > lances. To elicit emotion, both allegory and the marvellous come to the aid > of history. [...] Lionel Royer relies heavily on the precise depiction of > historical sites. [...] Joan, alone in the foreground, is the means by which > a possible reconciliation between the political and religious spheres is > suggested. [...] By the evocative synthesis he achieves and the deep feeling > he introduces here, the painter leaves interpretation open to each > observer.\\" (Chantal Bouchon - Revue Historique et Arch√©ologique du Maine) Royer reprised this Johannic iconography (assisted by Charles Lorin of Chartres, master glazier) at the basilica of Domr√©my. In the window entitled D√©p√¥t de l‚Äô√©p√©e de Fierbois par un ange, the face of Jean Poton de Xaintrailles bears the features of the architect Paul S√©dille. > \\"Despite indications of the influence of the figures by Raphaelesque and > Ingresesque reminiscences, these windows have a connotation of appeals to > vengeance, in the vicinity of Domr√©my, so charged with symbolic > significance.\\" (Chantal Bouchon - Revue Historique et Arch√©ologique du > Maine) Royer had two daughters and a son. The son, who planned to become a priest, was injured in World War I and died shortly after. The two girls raised families in France and Belgium.

American transpersonal philosopher Ken Wilber and English humanistic psychologist John Rowan suggested that the average person has about a dozen subpersonalities. Subpersonalities are able to perceive consciousness as something separate from themselves, as well as domestic image attached to these elements. Ken Wilber defined subpersonalities as \\"functional self- presentations that navigate particular psychosocial situations\\". For example, if a harsh critic responds with judgmental thoughts, anger, superior feelings, critical words, punitive action, and/or tense physiology when confronted with their own and/or others' fallibility, that is a subpersonality of the harsh critic kicking in to cope with the confrontation situation. Psychologist David Lester has reviewed the extensive literature on subpersonality and subself theory. Lester, David. Theories of Personality: A Systems Approach. London: Routledge, 2019. (Ch. 8, Concept of Subselves). In psychotherapy Many schools of psychotherapy see subpersonalities as relatively enduring psychological structures or entities that influence how a person feels, perceives, behaves, and sees him-, herself or themselves. Over the history of psychotherapy, many forms of therapy have worked with inner diversity representations or subpersonalities. Early methods were Jungian analysis, psychosynthesis, transactional analysis, and gestalt therapy. These were followed by some forms of hypnotherapy and the inner child work of John Bradshaw and others. Eventually, forms of therapy largely based on working with subpersonalities have arisen, such as Voice Dialogue, ego-state therapy, and John Rowan's work. A recent and widespread subpersonality method is Internal Family Systems therapy (IFS therapy), developed by Richard C. Schwartz. He sees DID alters as on the same continuum as IFS parts (subpersonalities), the only difference being that alters are more polarized and split off from the rest of the internal system. Recent studies have shown that subpersonality integration in the psychosynthesis therapeutic setting can help clients relieve anxiety and rebuild their identities when dealing with culture shock, enhance creativity, and help to awaken personal and spiritual growth in self-identified atheists.

Subsequent versions incorporated new content not found in the original version, such as a second part of the story, Memories Off: Pure, originally released as a separate game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color on April 27, 2000. The gameplay in Memories Off follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the six female main characters. Memories Off has made several transitions to other media. A manga anthology was published in August 2000 by Enterbrain. It was followed by an original video animation series produced by E&G; Films released on three DVDs and VHSs between November 11, 2001, and March 8, 2002. Three novels and a drama CD were also produced. Gameplay A conversation in Memories Off depicting the main character talking to Ayaka. The gameplay in Memories Off requires little player interaction as much time is spent on reading the text that appears on the lower portion of the screen, representing either dialogue between characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a \\"decision point\\", where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all five plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in an alternate direction. In the versions subsequent to the original PS and PC releases, a second scenario called Pure is made available after the scenarios for the heroines, 1st Story, are completed. Pure covers the story set three years prior to the main portion of the game and revolves around Tomoya, Ayaka and Yue when they are still attending middle school. A third scenario called After Story is available immediately upon starting a new game in the PSP version. After Story is a continuation of the first portion of the game. Unlike the other scenarios, After Story is not accompanied by voice acting, character sprites and choices, allowing one to enjoy the story without any interaction. Plot and characters The story of Memories Off revolves around the male protagonist , a cynical seventeen-year-old student whose role the player assumes, and his interactions with his schoolmates during his second year attending the , in which the main part of the story takes place. Tomoya meets , a childhood friend one day on a train en route to school. Yue is a lively and innocent, but clumsy girl. She is the main heroine of the story, and has a crush on Tomoya, but decided not to pursue him early on. Tomoya later also meets , another heroine. Kaoru is a girl who transfers into Tomoya's class near the beginning of the story. She maintains a cheerful personality and articulate social skills, and excels in language subjects. Tomoya later also encounters , Memories Off third heroine. Shion is a girl who transferred into Tomoya's class in the past semester. She has a calm personality, and prefers to be isolated. Like Kaoru, Shion excels in language, and shows an interest in literature to the extent where she became a librarian. He also meets , another heroine. Koyomi is actually a university student, but commutes to the school in order to substitute her mother as the cashier for the school for a week.

Minamo has a lively personality, and also holds an interest in art. Due to her weak health, she has to constantly commute to hospitals. Tomoya is constantly reminded of his previous romantic interest , the main focus of the Pure story segment, as he continues his interactions with his many schoolmates. Ayaka is Tomoya and Yue's childhood friend and is Minamo's cousin. She maintains a kind and well-mannered, but timid personality. She passes away after being involved in a traffic accident towards the end of the Pure segment to Tomoya's dismay, leading him to constantly struggle to overcome with her death, and acts callously towards others. Development and release The writing team included alt=A 2016 photograph of Kotaro Uchikoshi. Like most of the previous games developed by KID, Memories Off was developed as an all-ages title, and does not contain any risqu√© situations. Art direction was headed by Yukihiro Matsuo, while character designs were provided by Mutsumi Sasaki. The scenario in the game was split between six people. Kotaro Uchikoshi worked on Ayaka's and Yue's story; Chab≈ç Higurashi worked on Shion's story; Riichir≈ç Abe worked on Miyako's story; Nobuhito Takabayashi worked on Kaoru's story; Tomohiro Sasaki worked on Minamo's story; and TAS who contributed to Ayaka's story.

Both songs were first introduced in the OVA series, and were composed, and written by Chiyomaru Shikura.

An iOS version was released on September 1, 2009. Reception Memories Off Complete, the Dreamcast version of the original visual novel, was well received by RPGFan, and was given an 83% from their grading scale. The reviewer praised the game's soundtrack and the game's Pure scenario, citing \\"it was very sweet, often funny, and it was wonderful seeing Tomoya's friendship with Ayaka and Yue\\", though noted the game's visuals and voice acting as \\"decent, but unremarkable\\". The reviewer concluded that although the game is not the most polished title, \\"it is a genre classic, and rightfully so\\". According to Uchikoshi, he received a lot of criticism from players after the game came out, who told him that he did not understand bish≈çjo games, and how the protagonist is supposed to be the player. This had a large impact on him, and influenced his later visual novel Ever 17: The Out of Infinity.

The Cascade Phase: A Study in the Effect of the Altithermal on a Cultural System (Doctoral dissertation, Department of Anthropology, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington). In 1972, Bense graduated at 27 years old and moved back to Florida to help take care of her family in the light of both her parent‚Äôs passing, her father in 1967 and mother in 1972.  Early Career in Archaeology  After graduating with her doctoral degree, Bense spent the next five years focusing on business endeavors related to her family‚Äôs north Florida farm. In 1977, she began teaching anthropology and archaeology classes at UWF and taught an archaeology field school at Kings Point site, St. Andrews Bay, Florida. This was the first field school ever taught by UWF. Next, Bense headed the cultural resource reconnaissance of the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge on the Florida Gulf Coast from 1977‚Äì1978.Bense, Judith A. (1977). Cultural Resource Reconnaissance in the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, Florida. tDAR id: 131069 This project was immediately followed by a mitigation project in Mobile, Alabama, and a testing project along the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, Mississippi.Bense, Judith A. (1982). Archaeological Testing Investigations at 58 Sites in the River and Canal Sections of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. tDAR id: 173238 The last project led her to be appointed as a senior research archaeologist for the Office of Archaeological Research at the University of Alabama. In this position she managed numerous large projects. The reports of which are all available on the list of Judith Bense's works on the Digital Archaeology Record‚Äôs website and speak to the extensive nature of projects on which she served as the lead archaeologist or principal investigator.  University of West Florida Anthropology Program  While Bense enjoyed both teaching and research she was turned off by large university departments such as the ones she had experienced at FSU, WSU, and then again at the University of Alabama. She made a deal with UWF to bring her CRM contracts to the school if they agreed to allow her to establish an anthropology program. In 1980, Bense started the WSU anthropology department as well as a research unit, the UWF Archaeology Institute.Levy, Art (2018). Florida Icon: Judith A. Bense, Florida Trend, accessed November 15, 2019 https://www.floridatrend.com/article/25062/judith-a-bense In 1988, she received tenure and became a full professor eight years later in 1994. In 1991, she collaborated with the UWF History department to create a master‚Äôs program in historical archaeology. In 2000, she became the department chair and introduced a master‚Äôs program in anthropology two years later.  Public Archaeology in the Florida Panhandle  Her true passions were ignited in 1984 when a new city hall was constructed in downtown Pensacola and in the process unearthed and destroyed some of the town‚Äôs colonial history. Bense led a short salvage project and in the process recognized the importance of educating local community members and leaders about the archaeological and historical resources in their very backyard. As downtown Pensacola underwent an urban renewal, a massive urban archaeology project headed by Bense was started to preserve and detail the Spanish and British colonial history of the city. Later that same year, Bense worked with Gulf Power on another massive public archaeology program. The company was building a new headquarters on a known Middle Woodland period site and a historic African American neighborhood known as Hawkshaw.Bense, Judith A. (1985). Hawkshaw: Prehistory and History in an Urban Neighborhood in Pensacola, Florida. Report of Investigations,1. Pensacola, FL: Office of Cultural and Archaeological Research, Univ West FL. tDAR id: 117755 Although the company was not under obligation, Bense was able to conduct archaeological excavations for two years. The information was accessible to the public through a series of programs, publications, and exhibits. Bense and Gulf Power were awarded the National Public Service Award from the Department of the Interior for the project in 1986, making the Hawkshaw project the first archaeology venture to be bestowed this honor.Bense, Judith A. Curriculum Vita. UWF, accessed October 25, 2019, http://pages.uwf.edu/jbense/FullVita.html Cultural Resource Management or Public Archaeology became a mainstay in Pensacola culture over the next few decades. Excavations were undertaken at the Presidio San Miguel de Panzacola, British Fort of Pensacola, the Spanish Town of Pensacola, the Spanish Presidio Santa Mar√≠a de Galve on the Naval Air Station, and the Presidio Isla de Santa Rosa on the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Because of the focus on disseminating this information to the general public, both public interest and knowledge in Pensacola‚Äôs heritage grew.  Underwater Archaeology at UWF  In the early 1990s, the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey was conducted for the Bureau of Archaeological Research (BAR) and uncovered a 16th century Spanish shipwreck, named the Emanuel Point, off the shoreline. In 1997, BAR and UWF Anthropology partnered together to finish the excavation. Following this, Bense decided that underwater archaeology needed to be incorporated into the UWF curriculum. She felt strongly that underwater resources in the area needed equal attention. In 1999, UWF began excavating the remains of frigate and flagship of the Spanish Windward Fleet names the Rosario. = Florida Public Archaeology Network (FPAN) = In 2004, Bense worked alongside other CRM professionals and public archaeologists to write the legislature and obtain funding to start the Florida Public Archaeology Network (FPAN) This program is housed out of UWF but has offices and representations throughout the state of Florida. Employees and volunteers raise awareness of Florida archaeology through public outreach, work with local government to protect and curate cultural resources, and provide assistance to the Florida Division of Historical Resources. = Unearthing Florida Public Radio Show = When Bense began doing public archaeology within both the Pensacola community and the broader state of Florida, she recognized that the information could be distributed in multiple ways to the public. She started a radio show through the UWF NPR channel called Unearthing Pensacola. The show has now morphed and discusses more broadly Florida historical archaeology and is produced under the name Unearthing Florida Service Bense has provided significant service as well to the archaeological community. She served from 1984-1999 on the Governmental Affairs Committee of the Society of American Archaeology‚Äôs (SAA); as the conference chair for the Southeastern Archaeological Conference in 1984 and 1999 and their board of directors from 1980-1985 and 1997-1999; vice president of the Florida Anthropological Society from 1992-1993; from 1995-1997 on the Florida Archaeological Council‚Äôs board of directors; chair of the Stewards of Heritage Awards Committee from 1994-1995; and on the Florida Archaeological Week Committee in 1993. = UWF Presidency (2008-2016) = Bense was appointed interim president of the University of West Florida in 2008 and served until 2016. She was not only the first woman president of the college but also the first anthropologist to become the president of a public university in the US. She had taken her approach of involving the community in archaeology to her position as president in which she has sought to involve and embed the UWF community within the community of Pensacola. During her time as president, she was able to secure a grant to fully fund and establish a football program at the school.

He is best known for having been the drummer in the English ska group The Specials. Early life and education John was born in Coventry, where his father, Bert, was a painter and decorator for the council, and his mother, Joan, worked first for GEC (she was a shop steward) and then at Walsgrave hospital, where she helped with care in the maternity ward. She was staunchly anti-racist and concerned with immigrants‚Äô rights, and her views had a powerful effect on her son. He became fascinated by drumming as a child, and when he was eight his mum bought him a drum kit. According to his sister, Jill, \\"she then put egg boxes on the walls to stop the sound reaching the neighbours\\". Brad had three elder sisters, and it was they who took him to clubs and first introduced him to northern soul. He attended Binley Park school in Coventry, and went on to study fine art at Hull Art College. Later he took a teaching course in Birmingham, where he taught art and English. Back in Coventry, he became part of a small group of former art students and music fans who included Jerry Dammers, with whom he shared a house. \\"We had friends in common, but at that time I didn‚Äôt know he could play drums,\\" said Dammers. It was while he was working at the Virgin record store in Coventry that Brad first met Hall, another music fan with similar taste. \\"We grew up two streets away from each other,\\" said Hall, \\"but hadn‚Äôt met. He was like my older brother. He took me under his wing and looked after me.\\" Career John was asked to join The Specials after their original percussionist (\\"a strict reggae drummer\\", according to bassist Horace Panter) had left. He made his first appearance with the band on their first hit single, Gangsters, which was remarkable for having a song by a completely different band, the Selecter, on the B-side. Stranger still, the drummer playing on that Selecter track happened to be Brad. Brad played a crucial role in the history of the Specials, the still massively successful multiracial band that first shook up the British music scene in the late 1970s and early 80s by mixing Jamaican ska with punk energy, a bravely political stance and good humour. They were that rarity, a thoughtful band who created great dance music, and Brad was central to their distinctive style. According to the band‚Äôs bass player, Horace Panter: \\"He called his approach ‚Äòattack drumming‚Äô and it became the Specials‚Äô signature sound. He mixed the drive of northern soul with a reggae feel. And he improvised. He was different every night.\\" With the Specials he toured Britain, packing out dancehalls where followers showed their respect by wearing the uniform of pork pie hats and black-and- white sweaters. This was the era of the National Front, and NF supporters were eager to break up the multiracial party. Brad once explained: \\"They would position themselves so they could sling abuse ‚Ä¶ and objects, if they got the chance. But they usually didn‚Äôt get the chance, because we would stop mid- number, put the spotlight on the ring-leader, and the audience would take care of the rest.\\" Brad helped the Specials to become the outstanding British band of 1979, both for their recordings and live performances. Many of their best- known songs were written by Dammers, but Brad was involved in co-writing favourites that included Gangsters and Nite Klub. The band recorded seven UK top 10 singles, including Too Much Too Young and Ghost Town, but split up in 1981. Brad continuing to work with Dammers in the Special AKA, best known for that classic political anthem Nelson Mandela. For Dammers, the group‚Äôs founder and keyboard player, John was \\"highly intelligent, had a mischievous sense of humour which could be very funny, and he played the drums with an incredible amount of energy which was a very important part of the Specials‚Äô sound and live shows\\". For the singer Terry Hall, he was simply \\"a great drummer\\". After the Specials split, and while still involved with the Special AKA, Brad started his own band, JB‚Äôs Allstars, influenced by northern soul. They released five singles, including Alphabet Army (1986), a song written by Brad that stressed the importance of teachers. There followed a period of over 20 years in which it seemed that his music career had stalled. He looked after his son, Elliot, while his wife, Emily, worked in the fashion industry, and he was involved in a series of projects that included computer programming and maintenance.  The Specials Reunion  Brad played a key role in reuniting the band (though now without Dammers). His life changed dramatically with their triumphant comeback at the Bestival festival on the Isle of Wight in September 2008. The band proved that they could still attract large and enthusiastic crowds, even without Dammers, and set off on extensive tours across the UK, Europe, North America and the far east. In 2011 they packed out Alexandra Palace in London, where more than 10,000 people sang along to Ghost Town, a song that has as much relevance today as it did in the early 80s. The live album The Specials: More Or Less (2012) was a well-produced reminder that the band could still do justice to their classic repertoire ‚Äì and that Brad was still in powerful form behind the drums. \\"These songs have survived because they address issues that are still there,\\" he said. In 2014 the Specials‚Äô four-night stint in London included three shows at the Roundhouse, and in 2015 their tours included Mexico and Chile. For 2016 they had planned a five-night run at the Troxy, London. A fitness enthusiast, Brad had seemed as energetic as ever, and massively excited by the prospect of the first new Specials songs since the 80s.  Death  Brad died aged 62 on 28 December 2015, just as the Specials were beginning to embark on a new project. He had talked enthusiastically about the new material he had been writing, and Hall says that the band had \\"just started recording new material, including his songs. We‚Äôd been talking about it for years.\\" He is survived by his wife Emily, whom he married in 1987, and only son Elliot born 1988. Influences Bradbury cited his main influences as Al Jackson Jr. and Sly Dunbar.

Lima reached its height during the early years of the twentieth century. As the city became a major center for Standard Oil and as the hometown Lima Locomotive Works became a major player in the manufacturing of locomotives, the economy boomed, and many large buildings were erected in and around downtown. Although the 1930 post office was built near the end of this boom period, its architecture greatly resembles that of many buildings constructed during the boom. Architecture Completed in 1931, the current post office is a single-story concrete building. Each end of the building features pilasters, doubly fluted, and a large triple casement window with a balustrade beneath. Elsewhere in the building, the casement windows are three panels tall and two panels wide; many windows feature a prominent transom. Customers can enter the building through any of three double doors, which are located between pairs of pilasters carven to resemble columns. =Interior= The interior of the post office is built primarily of marble and of hardwoods.

The majority of charities in England and Wales (totaling about 190,000) have an income under ¬£10,000, and only about 22% of charities have any staff at all.2012 Civil Society Almanac Many community groups and small voluntary organisations are not registered charities, because either their turnover is below the threshold for registration or their purpose does not fall within the definition of charitable activity. Much literature about governance is written from the perspective of the minority of larger charities; this article attempts to address the topic by focusing on the experience and concerns of the majority. Governance is the process through which a group of people make decisions which direct their collective efforts. This typically features delegation to a smaller group, which is in turn accountable to the stakeholders or owners of the organisation.  Role  In small voluntary organisations, those entrusted with the governance function (the governing body or board of trustees) are expected to carry out both governance functions and to also perform other roles within the organisation.Selznick (1992) \\"To govern is to accept responsibility for the whole life of the institution. This is a burden quite different from the rational coordination of specialized activities (i.e. management). Governance takes account of all the interests that affect the viability, competence and moral character of an enterprise‚Äù. Core functions are: *To ensure that the charity remains true to its mission and values *To determine its strategy *To act as the point of final accountability for its actions and those of its representatives and staff *To safeguard its assets When the organisation employs staff, the governing body undertakes the management role of hiring, firing and holding the head of staff accountable.Carver (1997: p16): ‚Äú‚Ä¶acting on behalf of an identifiable ownership, ensure that the organisation achieves what it should while avoiding what is unacceptable.‚Äù Another role is as liaison between the organisation and the outside world: providing a conduit for information and ideas, representing it and acting as an ambassador for it. In addition to these governance functions, trustees of small charities may also be expected to: *Act as a pool of expertise and advice, making this available to staff and volunteers *Manage one (or more) staff, volunteers or projects (for instance, managing the work of the coordinator or production of the newsletter)Adirondack (1999: p6) adds that ‚ÄúGovernance is not necessarily about doing; it is about ensuring things are done.‚Äù *Carrying out the work of the organisation: staffing a helpline, answering correspondence and so onThe Charity Act 1993: s.97(1): ‚ÄúThe charity trustees are the people responsible ‚Ä¶ for controlling the management and administration of the charity.‚Äù The literature typically restricts its coverage to ‚Äúpure‚Äù governance functions; it does not pay attention to these other functions which are carried out by the trustees of small charities, seen by staff, volunteers and committee members as the contribution made by them to the organisation.  Governors  There is sometimes a lack of clarity concerning who the governing group is, what they are called and how many of them there are.Otto and Clifton (2005) Governance is the \\"functions and processes performed in an organisation by members by members of the management committee‚Äîthat is, the governing body\\". The Charity Commission's preferred term is \\"trustee, but a more-common term is \\"management committee member\\". Other terms include: *Executive Committee member *Board member *Director *Governor *Council Member The Charity Commission has details of about 890,000 charity trustees. Since community groups and small voluntary organisations do not have to register, the precise number of those involved in governing them is unknown but is estimated to be about one million. This gives a grand total of almost two million people in governance positions in community groups, voluntary organisations and charities in England and Wales.  Concerns  At the turn of the 21st century, a number of overlapping areas of concern arose and reshaped the environment for governance. These included: *International debate about the role of civil society *Concern about scandals in the private, public and voluntary sectors concerning those in governing positions *Gap in understanding between funders and regulators on the one hand and small charities and voluntary organisations on the other Kumar S, Nunan K, \\"A Lighter Touch\\" Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 2002 Competing governance requirements have arisen, and each stakeholder in small organisations has concerns about governance: *Regulators are concerned with declining public confidence in charities. *Funders are concerned with reputation and financial risk. *Trustees/management committee members feel that the duties expected of them are unclear. *Members find themselves competing with funders, as accountability to funders usurps their role in controlling the organisation.  Conflicts  Small voluntary organisations find themselves faced with four competing governance requirements: *Whilst countering social exclusion and strengthening civil society, they must be accountable to members and have a strong voice. *Whilst delivering services to users, they must be accountable to funders/purchasers. *Whilst promoting social entrepreneurship, they must balance accountability to a wide group of stakeholders with individual action. *Whilst engaging in consultation and lobbying, they must demonstrate responsiveness and accountability to the community. Kumar S, Nunan K, \\"A Lighter Touch\\" Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 2002  Definitions  Governance is defined in a variety of ways: *Structurally (for example, having a constitution) *Processes (for example, having sub-committees in positions of responsibility) *Roles and functions *Group dynamics (teamwork) *Individual competence (for example, chairing skills) Chait R, Holland T, Taylor B \\"Improving the Performance of Governing Boards\\" Oryx Press, 1996 A more comprehensive way of looking at governance is to view it as the sum of these perspectives. One way of connecting all of these aspects of governance is to visualize a governance system (see below). The individual competencies and resulting group dynamics between the individuals can be seen as the inputs into the system. Those skills and group processes are then applied through the structures and processes that are in place, resulting in governance (the outputs).Duca (1996: p3): ‚ÄúGovernance is how a board goes about exercising its authority over an organisation; it is a system or process for managing a board's affairs‚Äù. Image:GovernanceSystemDiagram.png For example, a governance \\"output\\" (or function) is to be accountable for the organisation. This is achieved by the individual trustees using their skills in evaluation and analysis, applying them in the group setting through the committee using committee structures (such as a meeting) and processes (an agenda).  Assessment  Once governance has been defined, it should be possible to assess it. However, because of the complexity involved it is tempting to choose one or two aspects of governance and assess them by taking a small number of features as a proxy for good governance. For practical reasons, it is common to look at just two aspects of governance (individual skills and structures); these are tangible, visible features of an organisation‚Äôs governance. Thus, it is possible to assess whether the trustees possess a particular range of skills and certain structures (such as a constitution) are in place.  Balance  Governance can be considered as keeping a balance between competing and conflicting demands: *\\"Watchdog\\" or \\"cheerleader\\" *More involvement or less *Management versus planning *Short or long term *\\"Big picture\\" versus details The balance depends on circumstances: the organisation's life cycle, its current health and demands on the committee. It is a judgement for the committee to make.  Organizational life cycle  There are two views of an organisation's life cycle. The first, linear view is that (like organic life) organisations progress through stages from birth, infancy, adolescence, maturity, senescence and death. The second view is that within this continuum organisations can start at different points and skip (or repeat) stages in cycles. For instance, with appropriate support and backing an organisation can begin its life in a fully formed, \\"mature\\" state. Mature organisations may collapse and begin anew in infancy or adolescence before developing into a mature organisation, sometimes repeating this process. The governing body's role changes, according to the stage of the organisation‚Äôs life cycle. The transition from one stage to another may be particularly challenging for governance.

According to the NCCUSL, UECA does not specify what the controls on a particular property should be, what cleanup level is appropriate, or whether a responsible party should be released from cleanup liability. The purpose of UECA is rather to ensure that future LUCs which have been created for a particular site are not invalidated by conflicts or misunderstandings with other local, state or federal regulations.UECA Web UECA seeks to make sure environmental covenants are preserved and enforceable over a very long term against successive owners by applying traditional real estate law. Part of the philosophy is that if all parties to the covenant are confident that site-appropriate activity and use limitations in the covenant will be enforced, it is more likely that environmental regulators and the owners of contaminated real property will allow those properties to be developed, rather than continue to stand as abandoned and dangerous areas. It is hoped that redevelopment of the property, particularly in America‚Äôs urban centers, will help revitalize those cities and serve the economic and social interests of their residents.

He was also the Chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM);The longest serving Mp for Tinderet who is also renowned large scale owner of tea farms.He was defeated in his bid to be elected on an ODM Party as a Nandi County Senator allegedly for bring in the wrong party. He is currently the most favoured to take the governors sit in the upcoming elections.  Early life  Henry Kiprono Kosgey was born on 14 July 1947 to Kipkosgey arap Moita and Martha Moek. Kosgey's father was a member of the Nandi sub-tribe of the Kalenjin community and his mother was from the Keiyo sub-tribe. Kosgey was raised in Nandi, Rift Valley Province where the family first lived in village called Kipkabos before later moving and settling in another village also in Nandi called Lelwak. Kosgey attended Lelwak Primary and later Kilibwoni Primary for his primary school education. For his \\"O\\" Level secondary education he attended Kapsabet High School.https://softkenya.com/education/kapsabet-boys- high-school/ He then went to Strathmore College in Nairobi for his \\"A\\" Levels. Kosgey then studied at the University of Nairobi where he graduated with a degree in Chemistry. He later won a scholarship to attend Ballarat University in Australia, where studied and obtained a postgraduate degree.  Politics  Kosgey has been in Kenyan politics for more than 30 years serving both in Parliament and the Cabinet = Parliament = Kosgey was first elected as MP of Tinderet Constituency in Rift Valley Province in 1979 under Daniel Arap Moi's Kenya African National Union (KANU) party. Kosgey won the seat in a hotly contested election where he defeated veteran vocal politician, Jean- Marie Seroney. Many thought that Kosgey who at the time was only 32 years old and a very shy public speaker, would not last very long and would soon be out of office. However Kosgey surprised all by working diligently for the people of Tinderet. He subsequently won re-election to Parliament on five occasions (1983, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007) Kosgey is the second longest-serving Member of Parliament after current President Mwai Kibaki (first elected in 1963). However Kosgey spent the period 1988 to 1992 outside Parliament. During the infamous 1988 elections, nearly all sitting M.Ps were forced out of office by an increasingly dictatorial regime. The controversial elections of that year precipitated a political crisis that eventually led to changes in the constitution to allow for more than one political party, paving the way for the historic 1992 multi-party elections. Despite the presence of different political parties in the 1992 elections, KANU remained the dominant party in the Rift Valley Province due to the fact that its party leader and incumbent President Moi came from the Province. Kosgey therefore stood on a KANU ticket and was overwhelmingly re-elected to Parliament by the people of Tinderet. However KANU only won a narrow majority of parliamentary seats in the 1992 elections. The party retained this narrow majority in the 1997 elections. In both cases Kosgey formed part of the KANU parliamentary majority. In the 2002 elections, although Kosgey once again won his Tinderet parliamentary seat, KANU lost its majority in parliament. The party also lost the presidential elections. Kosgey together with other members of KANU found themselves in the Opposition. While in Opposition, Kosgey was able to re-invent himself as a popular national figure. When Raila Odinga and other key members of parliament formed a new party called Orange Democratic Movement, they elected Kosgey as the Party's National chairman. In the 2007 elections Kosgey stood and was elected to Parliament by the people of Tinderet on an ODM ticket. He, and other members of ODM, supported and campaigned for the party's presidential candidate, Raila Odinga. Following the disputed 2007 elections, Raila's ODM and President Kibaki's Party of National Unity agreed to work together. Kosgey alongside other members of parliament passed the National Accord and Reconciliation Act of 2008. This provided for the formation of the Grand Coalition government that would ensure peace and work for the best interests of all Kenyans. = Cabinet = During his political career, Kosgey has served in the following ministerial positions: 1\\\\. 1979 to 1985: Minister for Transport and Communications At the age of 32, Kosgey became one of Kenya's youngest ever Cabinet Ministers when he was appointed in 1979 to head the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The early 1980s was a period of rapid growth for Kenya's economy and as Minister, Kosgey was in charge of supervising the constructions of numerous roads; the setting up of Kenya Airways, Kenya Railways, Kenya Ports Authority following the disintegration of the East African Community. He also worked to modernise the telecommunications sector, making changes to what was then known as the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC). 2\\\\. 1985 to 1987: Minister for Co- operative Development Following a re-shuffle in 1985, Kosgey was moved to the less high-profile Ministry of Co-operative Development. As Minister, Kosgey was tasked with improving and developing the co-operative movement in Kenya. 3\\\\. 1987 to 1988: Minister for Culture and Social Services In 1987, with only a few months remaining to the 1988 All Africa Games that were scheduled to take place in Kenya, Kosgey was moved to the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. The Ministry was in charge of organising the games. At the time there were numerous last minute preparations that needed to be done and Kosgey was given the responsibility of putting things in place. This was achieved, eventually resulting in the games taking place successfully. However, after the games, it was discovered that millions of shillings had been lost as a result of an advertising contract that had been awarded to a company owned by an American called Dick Berg. Berg had fled the country soon after the games concluded. Kosgey was accused of having been involved in the scandal. Kosgey denied the allegations claiming that the contract was awarded to Berg before he was moved to the ministry. A subsequent Commission of Inquiry cleared Kosgey of any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, the controversy tainted Kosgey's political career and continues to be cited by critics as examples of mistakes that he committed in the past. 4\\\\. 1988 to 1992: Not in Parliament or Cabinet. 1990 to 1992: served as chairman, Kenya National Assurance Company. In 1990 Kosgey was appointed Chairman of the Kenya National Assurance Company (KNAC). He served in this position until 1992 when he resigned to contest that year's elections. In 1996, KNAC collapsed due to a huge amount of debt. Critics accused Kosgey of having mismanaged the company during the period when he was chairman. Kosgey however maintains that he only headed the company for 2 years and that it collapsed 4 years after he left office. In addition, the 1990s was a period in Kenya's history where corruption and mismanagement had reached enormous proportions. The problems that affected KNAC affected numerous other state corporations because the underlying causes were systemic and not particular to any individual. 5\\\\. 1996 to 1997: Minister for Environment and Natural Resources: Kosgey was elected as a member of parliament in 1992 but spent the period 1992 to 1996 outside Cabinet in the back-bench. In 1996, during a mini re-shuffle he returned to the Cabinet when he was appointed Minister for Environment and Natural Resources. 6\\\\. 1998 to 1999: Minister for Tourism After the 1997 elections, Kosgey was appointed Minister for Tourism. At the time Kenya's Tourism sector was going through a very difficult period due to bad publicity in the international media following the 1997 elections. Matters worsened in 1998 when Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist group bombed the American Embassy in Nairobi. Kosgey therefore had the difficult task of restoring confidence in the tourism industry while managing and improving Kenya's image abroad. 7\\\\. 1999 to 2001: Minister for Science and Technology In 1999 Kosgey was moved and made Minister of Science and Technology, in the larger Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. He served in this position until 2001. 8\\\\. 2001 to 2002: Minister for Education In 2001, he was made Minister for Education. Kosgey spent most of this period negotiating with teachers who were pushing for salary increases. 9\\\\. 2008 to March 2013: Minister for Industrialization (suspended from 4 January 2011 to 10 August 2012) Following the disputed 2007 elections and the formation of the grand coalition government, Kosgey was appointed Minister for Industrialization. Kosgey decided to step aside in January 2011 to face charges of abuse of office relating to the importation of vehicles older than 8 years. Following a lengthy court case, the High Court cleared Kosgey of any wrongdoing on 28 June 2012. On 10 August 2012 President Kibaki reinstated Kosgey as Minister for Industrialization.  Court case  On 4 January 2011 Kosgey was arrested and charged in court over allegations that he authorised the importation of 113 vehicles that were older than 8 years. The law bars the importation of vehicles older than 8 years but gives the Minister powers to exempt imports from this rule. The law provides for the National Standards Council to advise the Minister on the issuance of such exemptions. It also states that the Minister should satisfy himself that it is in the national interests to grant the exemptions. Kosgey is accused of having exempted 113 vehicles from this rule without obtaining advice from the National Standards Council and without satisfying himself that it is in the national interests to give these exemptions, and by so doing abusing his office. He has denied the charges. During the trial the Prosecution made the case that the requirement to obtain advice from the NSC is mandatory and the fact that the Minister granted exemptions without such advice meant that he broke the law. They further argued that the exemptions were not motivated by any national interests as required by law. Kosgey's defence argued that the requirement to obtain advice is not mandatory. As for the issue of national interests, they stated that this is subjective and is a matter of opinion. They also argued that Kosgey was acting according to the precedent set by his predecessors. His immediate predecessor, former Minister Mukhisa Kituyi, issued approximately 3,000 exemptions using the same law and in exactly the same manner as Kosgey without obtaining any advice from the NSC. This fact is not disputed by the Prosecution who argued that two wrongs do not make a right. Kosgey's defence have also argued that the issuance of the exemptions did not result in any loss of revenue for the government, if anything the government collected taxes for each of the 113 vehicles that had been exempted from the 8-year rule. On Thursday 28 June 2012 the High Court in Nairobi dismissed the case against Kosgey and cleared him of any wrongdoing. In his ruling, Justice Nicholas Ombija said that Kosgey's prosecution had arisen due to differences that existed between Kosgey as the Minister and his Permanent Secretary, Karanja Kibicho. He termed the case as a gross abuse of the judicial system and an error in law.  ICC 2007 election allegations  Following the 2007 Kenyan presidential election, the incumbent, President Mwai Kibaki was declared the winner but this was disputed by the opposition who alleged fraud. The following 2007‚Äì2008 Kenyan crisis resulted in around 1,000 deaths on both sides and 200,000 people displaced.Figures based on the article 2007‚Äì2008 Kenyan crisis. Human Rights Watch said that on the opposition side, politicians had met with Kalenjin leaders to \\"organise, direct and facilitate\\" violent attacks against Kikuyus.Kenyan ethnic attacks 'planned', BBC News, 24 January 2008, accessed on 23 January 2012 Following mediation, the parties agreed to establish the Waki Commission to investigate the violence. The Waki Commission recommended the establishment of a local Tribunal and, failing that, referral to the International Criminal Court. In March 2010 the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) requested the Court to open an investigation into the Kenyan situation. On 15 December 2010, the Prosecutor announced that Kosgey was one of six Kenyans he had applied to the court for summons to be issued alleging crimes against humanity. The Prosecutor alleged that Kosgey was a \\"principal planner and organiser of crimes against PNU supporters\\".The six men accused of inciting Kenya's post- election violence CS Monitor On 8 March 2011 the Court issued summons for Kosgey together with the other 5 Kenyans to appear before the Court. Kosgey appeared voluntarily before the court on 7 April 2011. A date for confirmation of charges hearings was fixed for 1 September 2011. The hearing to decide whether or not to confirm the charges against Kosgey took place before the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II from Thursday 1 September 2011 to Thursday 8 September 2011. The Prosecution put forward a case alleging that Kosgey together with William Ruto and Joshua Sang were members of a network that organised violence in Kenya. Kosgey's lawyers presented his defence during the hearings and denied that Kosgey was a member of any illicit network, if indeed such a network existed. They argued that the Prosecution's case against Kosgey rests entirely on a single, anonymous witness, known only as witness 6. This witness claims that Kosgey attended planning meetings of the alleged network. Witness 6 is the only Prosecution witness to implicate Kosgey in this manner. Aside from the statement of witness 6, the Prosecution had no other evidence or proof of Kosgey's involvement in the planning of any violence. Kosgey's defence argued that the fact that the statement of witness 6 was not corroborated by any other source or any real material evidence means that it is unreliable. This view, they claim, is backed up by the ICC's own previous rulings and jurisprudence. According to Kosgey's defence, witness 6's statement amounts to hearsay and should therefore be dismissed. Kosgey's defence also complained that the Prosecution failed to carry out proper investigations in Kenya, noting that at no point did they interview or request to meet with Kosgey himself or even inform him that he was a suspect. They state that had this been done, Kosgey would have at least had an opportunity to understand the charges and offer exonerating and exculpatory evidence. On 23 January 2012 the International Criminal Court pre-trial chamber II declined to confirm any of the charges against Kosgey, citing insufficient prosecution evidence to sustain a full trial. Charges against his two co-accused were confirmed.4 Kenyans to Face Trial for Post-Election Violence, Voice of America, 23 January 2012  Post 2013 Elections  On 4 March 2013 Elections, Henry Kosgey contested Nandi County senate seat on an ODM ticket.

It opened in 1960 and closed in 1974. Background Maryglade College Seminary (Catholic) closed its Memphis, Michigan campus in May 1972. The following year students lived at St. James and later St. Nicholas of Tolentine parishes in the Detroit area, and attended classes at the University of Detroit, a Catholic college run by the Jesuit Fathers. Later they acquired property on Quincy Avenue, just behind the University of Detroit which remains to this day as the Motherhouse of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME) Fathers and the center for their promotional activities. Maryglade College Seminary, which was located at 400 Stoddard Road was under the direction of the PIME Fathers, a missionary society of priests and brothers, and a number of its graduates became priests and missionaries. The founder of the college was Father Nicholas Maestrini, PIME, author of many books on the missions, and regional superior. He also built seminaries in Newark, Ohio (Sts. Peter and Paul Mission Seminary) and Oakland, New Jersey (Queen of the Missions Seminary). The last rector at the closing of the Memphis Michigan campus was Fr. Carlo Brivio, PIME, a well-known entomologist. Maryglade was never very large, but the quality of education there was very high under the direction of many extremely talented priests. It offered one major, viz., Philosophy. Father Lawrence Chiesa PIME, was the head of the department for the greater part of the history of this college seminary. The large wooded campus, located on the Belle River, was an ideal and remote location for a seminary. The building was designed to hold 120 students and a faculty of 15. There was also a convent attached where Sisters ran the domestic department. Kennedy Angel The seminary chapel was noted for two works of art. The wall behind the main altar contained a very large mosaic showing the symbols of Matthew (angel), Mark (lion), Luke (ox), and John (eagle). They radiated out from a large crucifix, showing the preaching of the gospel to be a command from Christ. The lower part of the mosaic showed stylized buildings representative of Eastern and Western cultures so as to inspire the students to desire missionary activity around the world. The mosaic remains to this day in the chapel. (The building is used today as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center). The other noteworthy piece of art in the chapel was the so-called \\"Kennedy Angel.\\" When President John F. Kennedy was in college in 1939, he posed as an angel in a series of carved panels forming an arch. The series of scenes depicted the life of St. Theresa, the Little Flower. The work was carved by Irena Wiley, (author of Around the Globe in Twenty Years). This piece of art was removed from the chapel when the seminary closed. Maryglade was an accredited institution and was also a member of the Consortium of Catholic Colleges in the Detroit area.

Like in the other games from Arkanoid series, the main goal of each Clear level is to clear the entire display of blocks at the top of the screen, using a paddle to bounce a ball which destroys them. Eventually the ball falls back down, so the player has to make it hit the paddle. Sometimes, power-ups (magnetic paddle, increasing the number of balls) will drop after a certain block has been destroyed. It is activated once the player catches it before it disappears into the void (if the last ball drops there, a life is lost). However, in Quest mode, the player can attempt to complete any level in any preferred order, while trying to complete objectives specific for each level (time limit, restrictive number of balls). Arkanoid DS supports multiplayer mode through either local wireless or online play for up to four people in two different modes. Those are: Bust All mode (clearing a level first) and Bust Color mode (destroying all of the blocks of a specified color first). The levels played on are randomly selected and the players can keep an eye on the opponents via small images that appear in the play area. The game released in Japan with the Paddle Controller, a spinner mimicking the original arcade game's control knob for the left and right motion of the on-screen paddle. The game uses a \\"two screens-one display\\" design, where the screen is bordered within walls. It is one of the control schemes, which includes dragging with the stylus and using a directional pad. There is also a level and blocks customization option included that uses other games from Taito. For example, the blocks can be changed to look like Space Invaders ones or backgrounds to feature Bubble Bobble characters. The soundtrack was made by Zuntata, Taito's in-house team, using techno music to complement the action on the screen.

He has for long belonged to the Wiper Democratic Movement-Kenya party. During the 2017 general elections, he declined to defend his seat as Machakos Senator as a matter of principle protesting what he considered malpractices in the Wiper party's primaries. Muthama was the last MP of larger Kangundo Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya from 2007 to 2013. He is the immediate past Senator of Machakos County. He is among the national leaders of the Coalition for Restoration of Democracy (CORD) and the National Super Alliance (NASA) which served as Kenya's political opposition movements in the periods 2013-2017 and 2017-2022 respectively. Education and Personal Life Muthama is a graduate of the Gemological Institute of America. He is divorced from former his wife Agnes Kavindu who lost a bid to retain their matrimonial home in a court dispute Muthama claimed was politically instigated. Business life Muthama's vast business interests include mining, real estate, infrastructure, and agriculture. He is also a member of the Kenya Chamber of Mines. Muthama's mining firm Rockland Kenya Limited trades in gold, ruby, opal, gemstone, gypsum, diatomite, zinc, titanium and, other minerals. =Mining licence dispute= Between 2018 and 2019 Muthama's mining firm was embroiled in a licensing dispute with the Government of Kenya. An out of court settlement was sought for the dispute. The dispute was linked to a Government crackdown on businesses associated with opposition politicians. Career in PoliticsBefore 2007= Muthama once served as former ruling party KANU Vice Chairman in the larger Machakos District. He served under the Chairmanship of veteran Kamba politician, the late Joseph Mulu Mutusya. Muthama is credited with financially assisting the former Cabinet Minister Paul Ngei from being declared bankrupt soon after 1979 elections when Standard Bank Ltd served him with a bankruptcy note after it failed to locate Ngei‚Äôs assets to auction so as to recover Sh2 million debt. =Election terms served= Muthama was elected member of parliament (MP) for the larger Kangundo Constituency in 2007. He is credited with the split of the larger Kangundo Constituency giving birth to Matungulu Constituency. Muthama was elected as the first Machakos County Senator between 2013-2017. Muthama became the Government Chief Whip in the 10th Parliament in the National Assembly of Kenya from 2007 to 2013. =National Politics= 2007 Presidential Elections Muthama was instrumental in negotiating for a coalition between retired President Mwai Kibaki and Wiper Leader Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka who became Vice President to calm tension after chaos erupted following the controversial 2007 Presidential elections before the Grand Coalition government was formed with ODM Leader Raila Odinga being appointed Prime Minister. Roles in CORD and NASA During his term as Senator between 2013 and 2017, he served as the first Senate Minority Whip under the Kenya Constitution 2010. Muthama also co- chaired the Opposition outfit Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD). He went ahead to co-chair the national opposition movement management committee when the coalition transformed itself into National Super Alliance (NASA).  Position on compensation to MPs  As a first time legislator in 2008, being the member of parliament (MP) for Kangundo Constituency, Muthama took a stand that members of parliament are paid too generously. This according to him a situation not in tune with the economic realities of the rest of Kenyans. He earned the reputation of being the first MP to pay tax on his salary. He went against the wishes of the majority of fellow parliamentarians who were resisting the taxation of their salaries and were going as far as increasing their salaries. While not being an MP in 2019, he castigated the Kenyan legislators for awarding themselves extra house allowances. Position on National Cohesion In 2020, Muthama has taken an opposing position to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). He has asked Kenyans not to support the initiative blindly. He claimed that the initiative to change the Kenyan constitution appeared to amend the Kenya Government structures to address the self-interest of politicians rather than address challenges facing Kenyans. It is noteworthy that Muthama's estranged wife Agnes Kavindu is one of President Uhuru Kenyatta's appointees to the 14 member Steering Committee of BBI. Muthama is reported to have made proposals to the BBI initiative through his Wiper Party. The party is reported to have refused to present Muthama's proposals to the BBI steering committee. This is reported to play out in what is considered a supremacy battle for control of Kenya's lower eastern voting block in Ukambani. While criticizing the BBI initiative in January 2020, Muthama requested President Uhuru Kenyatta to resist the temptation to cling on to power beyond his second and final constitutional term in 2022. According to Muthama, the solution to Kenya's perennial problem of election violence and negative ethnicity is the Country's Presidency being held rotationally among its ethnic communities. Confrontation with Government Muthama is one of the politicians who have openly disagreed with Kenya's Jubilee government leadership. He was affiliated to Kalonzo Musyoka, the presumed leader of the Kamba community in Kenya. In early November 2013, Muthama publicly announced that the government of Uhuru Kenyatta had withdrawn his security due to his stand over the ongoing cases in the International Criminal Court where Uhuru Kenyatta is facing trials. In 2013 Muthama's personal security as a legislator was withdrawn. Muthama went public to state that his life was in danger. The security withdrawal resulted in public uproar. Muthama stated that he was not going to relent from speaking the truth in spite of the security withdrawal. In June 2016, Senator Muthama was among Eight Kenyan politicians arrested for alleged hateful public utterances. Six of the politicians were later arraigned in court. They were detained for four days in various police stations around Nairobi before reappearing in court. The charges against Senator Muthama were dropped on 28 July 2016. Position on Komarock land held by KBC In May 2020, Muthama led members of the public including local politicians in a day-long confrontation with public administration at a parcel of land in Koma Rock whose title is held by Kenya Broadcasting Cooperation (KBC). Muthama and his colleagues were protesting the surveying of the land parcel for allocation to squatters who hailed from Nairobi. Muthama is also enjoined in a legal dispute on the ownership of the land between the KBC and the Komarock Ranching and Farming Cooperative Society. According to Muthama, the land parcel constitutes community land held in trust for the residents of Matungulu and the larger Machakos County. = 2017 General elections = Johnson Muthama protested the nomination of Wavinya Ndeti as Wiper Party candidate for the office of the Machakos County Governor on the grounds that Wavinya who had been the CCU Party leader had been illegally enlisted into the Wiper party. When the Wiper party declined to rescind its decision to nominate Wavinya Ndeti, Muthama protested by declining to defend his Machakos County Senatorial position during the 2017 General Elections. He stated that it would be pointless to be elected to work alongside Alfred Mutua or Wavinya Ndeti as Governors. Muthama had thrown his support in the Machakos Gubernatorial Contest behind Bernard Kiala who he argued was the legitimate Wiper Candidate In the end, the Wiper Party lost both the Senatorial and Gubernatorial Seat in Machakos County. The Senatorial seat was won by Boniface Kabaka belonging to the less known CCU party. Muthama was reported to have abandoned the Wiper Party amid the challenges of the party primaries. In spite of protesting against The Wiper Party's candidate nomination exercise and declining to defend his Senatorial position, Muthama did not quit the Wiper party. The Wiper party primaries which were considered to be flawed were argued to explain why the party lost the Machakos County Senatorial position previously held by Muthama, and the Gubernatorial seat retained by Alfred Mutua of MCCP who had used it in the past 2013 elections. This was considered unusual in a region where the party was considered dominant. In 2019, both political allies and foes in Machakos County urged Muthama to abandon the Wiper Party. = 2022 Machakos Gubernatorial Election = In December 2018, Muthama announced his intention to vie for the Machakos County Governor Position at planned 2022 General Elections in Kenya. Muthama has since the establishment of County Governments been opposed to the leadership of Alfred Mutua, as Machakos Governor. According to Muthama, any person that will succeed Alfred Mutua as Machakos Governor will face a rough time fixing what he considers as the mess that Mutua will leave behind.

Early life Gantner was born and raised in Orlando, Florida, to Edward and Mary Lou Gantner. The youngest of four children, Ed was the only son with three older sisters. By the time he was three years old, his father would throw him a football hard enough to knock him down, only to get back up and throw it back. His mother and sisters never recall Gantner having a knack for football. He was considered a \\"puny little runt,\\" all the way through junior high school. Gantner's life began to change when he was around twelve years old, when his parents separated. His father moved out of the house, while his mother went back to school. His mother and sisters worked to keep the family afloat. He found solace in weight lifting, pumping iron for hours alone in his room. He also found solace in surfing. Football career Gantner's major football career started at Edgewater High School. Around his junior year, he began using steroids. Between his junior and senior years in high school, he gained 45 lbs. His newly found physique gained him confidence to point, where he talked incessantly about the weight he gained, how much he could lift, and the size of his biceps and neck. After graduating from high school, he received a college scholarship to play football for the University of Tennessee, but after less than a year, he became depressed and homesick. After returning home to Orlando, he took a hiatus, working as a bartender and a bouncer. In 1980, he returned to playing college football, this time for Central Florida, as a starter. He was also had the honor of being the first man from the college to go professional. He played pro football in the United States Football League, where he played for the Tampa Bay Bandits for one year, and for the Jacksonville Bulls for two years. Wrestling career Gantner made his pro wrestling debut in 1985 in Championship Wrestling from Florida. Gantner started out as a heel, as a part of the House of Humperdink, led by Sir Oliver Humperdink. Within the group, he formed a tag team with Kareem Muhammed called the Shock Troops. They made their debut on TV jumping The Fabulous Ones starting a program with them. They also unsuccessfully challenged The Road Warriors at Battle Of The Belts 3 on September 3, 1986. He would also have a feud with Lex Luger that would go on for a good part of 1986. In February 1987, Gantner was awarded the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship, after his manager Sir Oliver Humperdink defeated Bad News Allen for the title. After losing the title to Mike Rotunda a month later, Gantner turn on Humperdink, turning him face. Gantner feuded with Humperdink's group with Barry Windham, Blackjack Mulligan, Bugsy McGraw and even Dusty Rhodes as his partner at different times. However, by July 1987, even with him in most of the major angles for Championship Wrestling from Florida, he abruptly retired from pro wrestling due to health issues. Retirement and death In 1988, Gantner's health began to decline after years of steroid use. His kidneys were the first to start failing, causing him to undergo kidney dialysis, and he had to be hooked up several hours a week to a machine to survive. Doctors also recommended Gantner to lose 100 lbs, as he nearly weighed 300 lbs. He complied by giving up red meat and starting a holistic diet, making his own watermelon tea. Despite the changes, he could not stop using steroids, and had started using cocaine. He was rushed to the hospital for heart failure four times within two months. At that point, he started asking around for a firearm. By the fall of 1989, his heart and kidneys were failing, after refusing doctors' orders to lose weight and alter his exercise regimen. On Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 1989, Gantner received a kidney transplant, as his sister donated her kidney. His family thought the worst was over. However, five days after the transplant, he demanded lifting weights to be brought into his room, as he went back to using steroids. The strain of recovering from the transplant caused Gantner to lose weight, but he had still an imposing figure. Despite this, when he looked into a mirror, he saw a defective, distorted image. Self- conscious about his physique, he would wear shorts under his jeans to look bigger. While in the gym, he would wear an extra pair of socks to bulk up his calves. Over the next six months, he would go back to the hospital five times, because of complications. He would also move from Orlando, to St. Augustine, to West Palm Beach, working as a salesman. Early in the fall of 1990, Gantner's mental health began to falter even further, as he started calling his parents late at night. He would get dressed for work, make it to his car, and sit there for a half-hour with the keys in the ignition, before going back in his house. When his mother finally decided to bring him home in Orlando, she found him in a dark room, sitting down, rocking on his bed. Back home with his parents in Orlando, Gantner would not eat, sleep, or work out. He would shower constantly and pace all night long. When his mother tried to take him for a haircut, he made her drive all over town, and at each stop, he refused to leave the car. By November 1990, Gantner was admitted to a psychiatric ward at a Florida hospital, where he stayed until after Christmas. During this time, he began casting about for solutions and new truths‚Äîmeditation, vitamins, even faith healing with Rev. Benny Hinn. On New Year's Eve, December 31, 1990, Gantner was discovered lying motionless in the kitchen of his parents' home in Orlando, Florida. He was pronounced dead upon arrival when taken to the hospital, and his death was ruled a suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the heart. He was 31 years old.

A positive Massouh sign is a grimace of the patient upon a right sided (and not left) sweep. The explanation for the reliability of this diagnostic tool is based on the fact that appendicitis in the initial stage usually causes localised irritation of the peritoneum. The well innervated peritoneum is very sensitive to pain and therefore sensitive to jouncing movements. Similarly this is the explanation for other signs of localised peritonitis such as Murphy's sign, Rovsing's sign or Psoas sign.Acute appendicitis - Humes and Simpson 333 (7567): 530 - BMJ The Massouh sign became popular among surgeons in the Southwest Region of England as it is practicable and, together with other diagnostic tools, highly correlates with the appearance of acute Appendicitis.

He is famous as the author of the Jigu Suanjing (Continuation of Ancient Mathematics) one of the Ten Computational Canons. He presented this work to Li Yuan the first emperor of the Tang dynasty, along with a brief biography. According to this autobiography, he became interested in mathematics at a young age. After a study of the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art and particularly Liu Hui's commentary on it, Wang became a teacher of mathematics, and later deputy director of the Astronomical Bureau. It was known that the Chinese calendar at that time was in need of reform since, although only in operation for a few years, already predictions of eclipses were getting out of step. In 623, together with Zu Xiaosun, a Civil Servant, he was assigned to report on problems with the calendar‚Äîalthough only recently adopted, it was already out of step with the eclipses. In fact Wang did not approach this in a sophisticated way; he proposed to ignore the irregularity of the sun's motion and also the precession of the equinoxes‚Äîboth had already been incorporated in calendar calculations by Zu Chongzhi in the fifth century. Jigu Suanjing His major contribution was the Jigu suanjing (\\"Continuation of Ancient Mathematics\\" ÁºâÂè§ÁÆóÁªè), written before year 626. Jigu Suanjing became a text for the Imperial examinations; it was included as one of the Ten Computational Canons when reprinted in 1084. The book contains 20 problems based mostly on engineering construction of astronomic observation tower, dike, excavation of a canal bed etc. and right angled triangles, but which in essence deal with the solution of cubic equations, the first known Chinese work to deal with them. In Jigu Suanjin, Wang established and solved 25 cubic equations of the form: x^3+px^2+qx=N, along with 2 quadratic equations and 2 double quadratic equations. Wang's work influence later Chinese mathematicians, but it is said that it was his ideas on cubic equations which influenced the Italian mathematician Fibonacci after transmission via the Islamic world.

The population was 26,255 as of the 2010 census (2019 estimate 29,684). Eagle Pass borders the city of Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico, which is to the southwest and across the Rio Grande. The Eagle Pass-Piedras Negras Metropolitan Area (EG-PN) is one of six binational metropolitan areas along the United States-Mexican border. As of January 2008, according to the US census, the Eagle Pass Metropolitan Area's population was 48,401 people, and the Piedras Negras Metropolitan Area's population was 169,771. History Eagle Pass was the first American settlement on the Rio Grande. Originally known as Camp Eagle Pass, it served as a temporary outpost for the Texas militia, which had been ordered to stop illegal trade with Mexico during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.Texas Transportation Commission, Texas State Travel Guide, 2008, p. 232 Eagle Pass is so named because the contour of the hills through which the Rio Grande flows bore a fancied resemblance to the outstretched wings of an eagle. General William Leslie Cazneau (1807‚Äì1876) founded the Eagle Pass townsite in the 1840s.Handbook of Texas Online In 1850, Rick Pawless opened a trading post called Eagle Pass. In 1871, Maverick County was established, and Eagle Pass was named the county seat. During the remainder of the 19th century, schools and churches opened, the mercantile and ranching industries grew, and a railway was built. The United States Army established the presumably permanent Fort Duncan on March 27, 1849, a few miles upstream from Camp Eagle Pass. Captain Sidney Burbank supervised the construction of Fort Duncan, which was named after Colonel James Duncan, who had fought in the Mexican War. After the Mexican-American War, trade flourished under the protection of the fort. The fort was near the trail of westward immigration to California. It also served as an outpost against hostile Apache. It was abandoned and reopened several times. In March 1860, it served as the base of operations against the border assaults arranged by Juan N. Cortina.Texas Historical Commission, historical marker at Fort Duncan, Eagle Pass, Texas, 1970 Fort Duncan was held by the Confederacy during the American Civil War. On July 4, 1865, General Joseph O. Shelby, en route to offer his troops' service to Maximilian in Mexico, stopped at Fort Duncan and buried in the Rio Grande the last Confederate flag to have flown over his men. After several decades of deactivation, Fort Duncan was activated as a training camp during World War I. In 1938, the City of Eagle Pass acquired the fort and still operates a museum and a children's library at the site. The rancher and gunfighter King Fisher lived in Eagle Pass until his ambush and murder in San Antonio in 1884. During World War I, Camp Eagle Pass was established as a post of the U.S. Army. The 3rd Infantry Regiment was assigned there and patrolled the Mexican border. Lawsuit The City of Eagle Pass was sued by the US government in 2008 to gain access to the land and construct a fence on the United States‚ÄìMexico border.Texas City Ordered to Turn Over Land to Feds for Border Fence Construction, January 16, 2008 =Maverick County corruption scandal= An ongoing public corruption, bid-rigging, and kickback investigation by the FBI and Texas Department of Public Safety has resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of all four Maverick County commissioners, one justice of the peace, and multiple local government employees and businessmen since October 2012, making it the largest public criminal probe in Eagle Pass and Maverick County history. On February 20, 2015, a federal grand jury in Del Rio indicted a county commissioner and a former county justice of the peace in connection with an alleged bribery, kickback, and bid-rigging scheme, all related to the ongoing public corruption investigation. On February 23, 2015, former Maverick County Commissioner Rodolfo Heredia was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service after completing his prison term. He was also ordered to pay a maximum of $56,003.88 in restitution to Maverick County. =City of Eagle Pass gasoline card theft and fraud= On August 8, 2012, a federal grand jury in the U.S. District Court in Del Rio indicted five Eagle Pass residents, including a former Public Works Department employee, in connection with an estimated $70,000 credit-card fraud scheme. According to the indictment, during 2011, City of Eagle Pass employee Edgar Aguilar obtained five city of Eagle Pass-owned ‚ÄúFuelman‚Äù credit cards designated for fuel purchases for Public Works department vehicles and distributed them to his accomplices to purchase fuel for their own vehicles and to purchase fuel for others at the city's expense. In some instances, defendants charged individuals a reduced rate for fuel purchased using the city's credit card and then pocketed the cash. On November 29, 2012, Aguilar entered a guilty plea for the charges of theft and fraud and on May 15, 2013, was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $68,373.87 in restitution for his role in the fraudulent scheme. =Former city manager charged with lying to the FBI= On March 30, 2017, Hector Chavez, Sr., the former Eagle Pass city manager, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI regarding a bribery scheme involving public contracts in Maverick County. Chavez, with the company Chace Management, was charged with receiving $20,000 from the owner of the engineering firm Hejl, Lee and Associates to bribe a county commissioner to procure a $270,000 contract for the engineering firm. Chavez admitted to having given false information in 2015. Chavez was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison and three years' supervised release on August 21, 2017.Guillermo Contreras, \\"Ex-Eagle Pass manager faces up to 5 years for lying to FBI,\\" San Antonio Express-News, April 1, 2017, p. 6. Economic development The city and surrounding area are home to a variety of businesses in retail, import, food manufacturing, and freight forwarding/transportation. The Eagle Pass Industrial Park hosts a number of larger companies, including the O.F. Mossberg & Sons firearms manufacturing plant, which employs around 450 persons. Climate Eagle Pass has a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen: BSh), typical of South Texas. The average hottest month is August, and the highest recorded temperature was in 1944. On average, the coolest month is January, while the lowest recorded temperature was in 1962. Most precipitation occurs in the spring through fall with a drier winter. The highest monthly average precipitation occurs in September, with a secondary peak in May and June. Late July and August demonstrate a significant, secondary dry season, with very high temperatures and high sun exposure, resulting in high evaporation rates.

Among the presidents of California Concordia College was Johann Theodore Gotthold Brohm Jr.Theodore Julius Brohm Family Collection California Concordia College and the Academy of California College were located at 2365 Camden Street, Oakland, California. Some of the school buildings still exist at this location, but older buildings that housed the earlier classrooms and later the dormitories are gone. The site is now the location of the Spectrum Center Camden Campus, a provider of special education services. The \\"Academy\\" was the official name for the high school. California Concordia was a six-year institution patterned after the German gymnasium. This provided four years of high school, plus two years of junior college. Years in the school took their names from Latin numbers and referred to the years to go before graduation. The classes were named: * Sexta - 6 years to go; high school freshman * Qunita - 5 years to go; high school sophomore * Quarta - 4 years to go; high school junior * Tertia - 3 years to go; high school senior * Secunda - 2 years to go; college freshman * Prima - 1 year to go; college sophomore Those in Sexta were usually hazed in a mild way by upperclassmen. In addition, those in Sexta were required to do a certain amount of clean-up work around the school, such as picking up trash. Most students, even high school freshmen, lived in dormitories. High school students were supervised by \\"proctors\\" (selected high school seniors in Tertia). High school students were required to study for two hours each night in their study rooms from 7:00 to 9:00 pm. Students could not leave their rooms for any reason without permission. This requirement came as quite a shock to those in Sexta (freshmen) on their first night, when they were caught and scolded by a proctor when they left their study room to go to the bathroom without permission. Seniors (those in Tertia) were allowed one night off where they did not need to be in their study hall. From 9:00 to 9:30 pm all students gathered for a chapel service. From 9:30 to 10 pm, high school students were free to roam, and sometimes went to the local Lucky Supermarket to purchase snacks. All high school students were required to be in bed with lights out by 10:00 pm. There were generally five students in each dormitory room. The room had two sections: a bedroom area and (across the hallway) another room for studying. Four beds, including at least one bunk bed, were in the bedroom, and four or five desks were in the study room A few interesting words used by Concordia students were \\"fink\\" and \\"rack.\\" To \\"fink\\" meant to \\"sing like a canary\\" or \\"squeal.\\" A student who finked told everything he knew about a misbehavior committed by another student. \\"Rack\\" was actually an official term used by proctors and administrators who lived on campus in the dormitories with students. When students misbehaved they were racked (punished). Proctors held a meeting once a week and decided which students, if any, deserved to be racked. If a student were racked, he might be forbidden from leaving the campus grounds, even during normal free time School hours were from 7:30 am to 3:30 pm. After 3:30 pm and until 7:00 pm, students could normally explore the local area surrounding the school, for example, to go to a local store to buy a snack. However, if a student were racked for the week, he could not do so. Proctors made their rounds in the morning to make sure beds were made and inspected rooms in the evening to ensure that students were in bed by 10:00 pm. Often after the proctors left a room at night, the room lights would go back on and students enjoyed studying their National Geographic magazines. Student might be racked if they failed to make their beds or did not make them neatly enough.Source: Phil Seyer, student at California Concordia from 1955 to 1963 Although California Concordia College no longer exists, it does receive some recognition by Concordia University Irvine.About CUI-History-Historical Timeline This is also the location of its old academic records.

The screen adaptation is directed by Peter Brook, and originated in his theatre production for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The English version was written by Adrian Mitchell from a translation by Geoffrey Skelton. The cast included Ian Richardson, Patrick Magee, Glenda Jackson, Clifford Rose, and Freddie Jones. It was filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire and released by United Artists on 22 February 1967 in the United States, and 8 March 1967 in the United Kingdom. The film's score comprised Richard Peaslee's compositions. David Watkin was the cinematographer. The film uses the full title in the opening credits, though most of the publicity materials use the shortened form. Plot In the Charenton Asylum in 1808, the Marquis de Sade stages a play about the murder of Jean-Paul Marat by Charlotte Corday, using his fellow inmates as actors. The director of the hospital, Monsieur Coulmier, supervises the performance, accompanied by his wife and daughter. Coulmier, who supports Napoleon's government, believes that the play will support his own bourgeois ideas, and denounce those of the French Revolution that Marat helped lead. His patients, however, have other ideas, and they make a habit of speaking lines he had attempted to suppress, or deviating entirely into personal opinion. The Marquis himself, meanwhile, subtly manipulates both the players and the audience to create an atmosphere of chaos and nihilism that ultimately brings on an orgy of destruction.

Morgan Sheppard as A Mad Animal * John Steiner as Monsieur Dupere * Henry Woolf as Father Reception Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, based on , with an average rating of 7.96/10. Roger Ebert wrote, \\"The actors are superb. When we first see the Marquis (Patrick Magee), he looks steadily into the camera for half a minute and the full terror of his perversion becomes clearer than any dialog can make it. Glenda Jackson, as Marat's assassin Charlotte Corday, weaves back and forth between the melancholy of her mental illness and the fire of the role she plays. Ian Richardson, as Marat, still advocates violence and revolution even though thousands have died and nothing has been accomplished.\\" Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 4 out of a possible 4 stars, calling the film \\"chilling\\", praising the film's atmosphere as being \\"...so vivid that it seems actors are breathing down your neck\\". =Accolades= Brook shared the Nastro d'Argento for Best Director of a Foreign Film with Robert Bresson, who was honored for Mouchette, and received Special Mention at the Locarno International Film Festival.

MotorAve builds electric guitars. The company also performs guitar repairs and guitar modifications. MotorAve was founded in Los Angeles, California, by Mark Fuqua in 2002Bio on MAG, 19 Oct 2019. Its headquarters are in Durham, North Carolina.  History  Before founding MotorAve in 2002, luthier Mark Fuqua worked as a freelancer for guitar shops in San Francisco, California, while he began his first guitar repair business. Fuqua moved to Paris, France in 1998, where he continued building guitars for a living. In 2002, Fuqua opened his first MotorAve brick-and-mortar in Los Angeles. Fuqua moved the shop to Hollywood, California, in 2007, before relocating the business to Durham, North Carolina.MotorAve Guitars  Guitars  All MotorAve guitars are built by hand and can be fitted with several different options including different pick ups, fretboard, inlays and finishes.Josh Homme: New QOTSA Album 'Shakes More Ass Than Ever Before', interview on Ultimate Guitar website, 30 Jun 2007 = BelAire = The BelAire originated as a solid-body guitar built as a one-off for a customer looking for a large guitar due to his own large stature. To avoid back routed control cavities, the guitar was designed with a large pickguard, similar to the one of a Fender Telecaster Thinline. After the guitar was delivered Fuqua decided to create a semi-hollow version of the guitar with a Bigsby vibrato. The guitar had a solid core in the body's center and a sharp sound hole similar to what is normally found on Rickenbackers. During its construction Alain Johannes, visited the shop to pick up a vintage Maton which had been repaired and took a liking to the unfinished guitar. A few weeks later the finished guitar was delivered to Johannes and a week later Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme ordered one for himself which was his main guitar during the recording of Era Vulgaris. = LeMans = The LeMans was specially designed to be extremely thin much like a Gibson SG. The guitar is fitted with a single bridge pickup to allow for an extra strong neck joint which allows extra transference between neck and body. Another feature to make the guitar simple and easy to maintain is the control plate with a single volume control and jack input, the short and simple circuit also reduces capacitance for a clear tone. One of the first LeMans models were built for American hard rock band Burning Brides guitarist and vocalist Dimitri Coats.

This song is built around a guitar hook reminiscent of spy film scores and surf music. It has a twelve bar blues progression, using only three chords until the coda. The eleven cries of \\"Batman!\\" are sung by a chorus of four tenors and four sopranos (performed by The Ron Hicklin Singers). The enduring myth purporting that the chorus is actually an instrumental group was fueled in Adam West's book Back to the Batcave. However, Neal Hefti, the writer of the theme, stated that the chorus was made up of eight singers, one of whom jokingly wrote on his part, \\"word and music by Neal Hefti\\". TV's Biggest Hits by Jon Burlingame, published in 1996, focuses exclusively on TV theme songs, and includes an interview with Hefti about the creation of the Batman theme song. According to Burlingame, the song consisted of \\"bass guitar, low brass and percussion to create a driving rhythm, while an eight- voice chorus sings 'Batman!' in harmony with the trumpets.\\" In addition to Neal Hefti's original version, and the television soundtrack version by Nelson Riddle, versions were covered by The Marketts (single \\"Batman Theme\\" and album The Batman Theme by The Marketts), The Ventures (The Ventures Play the \\"Batman\\" Theme, Dolton BST8042, 3/1966), Al Hirt, The Standells and actor/musician David McCallum. The song has been parodied in the more than half-a-century since its debut. The theme has been re-recorded by dozens of artists, including Link Wray,Rumble! The Best of Link Wray: Rhino, 1993 Voivod, The Jam, The Who, and The Kinks. Covers * Jimmy Bowen Orchestra and Chorus released a version of the song on their 1966 album, Sunday Morning with the Comics. *Eminem mimics the theme in his song, ‚Äò‚ÄôWithout Me‚Äô‚Äô in 2002. *Jan & Dean covered the Batman theme song on their 1966 album, Jan and Dean Meet Batman. *English rock band The Who recorded a cover of the theme in 1966. It was originally released on the EP Ready Steady Who, but has since been re- released as a bonus track on CD pressings of A Quick One. *Neal Hefti played with and arranged for Harry James's band starting in the late 1940s, and Harry James released a cover of Hefti's Batman theme on his 1966 album Live at the Riverboat (Dot DLP 3728 and DLP 25728). *English rock band The Kinks played a cover of the theme at their show at Kelvin Hall, Glasgow, in 1967. The song was performed as part of a medley where the band appears to get lost. They start out with \\"Milk Cow Blues\\", then do the Batman theme, then \\"Tired of Waiting\\", then back to \\"Milk Cow Blues\\". It was released on the LP Live at Kelvin Hall. * Liverpool poet Adrian Henri and his band Liverpool Scene did a skit of the theme in the late 60s using Henri's poem Batpoem. *English punk band The Jam covered the \\"Batman Theme\\" on their debut album, In the City in 1977. *In 1966, an album called Batman and Robin: The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale was released featuring members of the Sun Ra Arkestra and The Blues Project. The opening track is a cover of the \\"Batman Theme\\", while the rest of the album is taken up with a combination of instrumental jams and modernised workings of classical pieces, all given Batman-oriented names. *Canadian metal band Voivod did a cover on their 1988 Dimension Hatr√∂ss album. *Serbian alternative band Disciplina kicme (Disciplin A Kitschme) did a cover on their album Najlep≈°i hitovi! U≈æivo! (The Most Beautiful Hits! LIVE!) (1987). *New York saxophonist and composer, John Zorn, led off his 1990 album, Naked City, with a version of \\"Batman\\". *The Well Paid Scientists (Henry Cullen & Dave Lalouche) produced an acid techno remix entitled To The Batrave......Let's Go in 1998. *According to Ritchie Blackmore, the main riff in \\"Space Truckin'\\" by the English rock band Deep Purple is based on the \\"Batman Theme\\". *Rapper Snoop Dogg sampled the Batman Theme for his song \\"Batman & Robin\\" on the album Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss (2002). It featured RBX and Lady of Rage and was produced by DJ Premier. *Stan Freberg recorded a comedy skit in 1966 entitled \\"Flakman and Reagan\\", about Ronald Reagan's campaign for the Governorship of California, with his straight adviser, a press agent named \\"Flakman\\". Freberg could not obtain the rights to use Hefti's music, and so a variation of the \\"Batman Theme\\" had to be used, without direct plagiarism.Pay Radio, Stan Freberg album, 1966 *A segment on Sesame Street in 1969 featured kindergarten children drawing sketches, that started with the letter B, had a bat drawn, in which one of the kindergarten boys was singing the \\"Batman Theme\\" as well as saying the man with a bat cape was called \\"Batman\\". *P.D.Q. Bach (Peter Schickele) quoted the \\"Batman Theme\\" in the last movement (\\"Agnus Dei\\") of his Missa Hilarious, while a car horn blasted out twice \\"Here Comes the Bride\\".A Portrait of P.D.Q. Bach (LP), 1975 *Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and his daughter Harper recorded a version of the Batman Theme in 2016 which is regularly played on Pearl Jam SIRIUS XM Radio. SIRIUS XM Radio also put out an accompanying video of Eddie and Harper's version of the theme on their YouTube channel with references to the Batman TV series. * The Lego Batman Movie prominently features the theme, though often sung or played in comedically ridiculous ways. * An instrumental rock version of the Batman Theme briefly appears in the Gotham episode \\"That's Entertainment\\". It is played by Jerome Valeska and his gang after they took over a rock concert. * The Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" features the theme playing briefly as Burt Ward portrays Dick Grayson of Earth-66, who experiences red skies. Legacy *Artists Prince and R.E.M. used variations of (but did not remake) the TV show theme in their work: Prince in the song \\"Batdance\\" (which appeared on the soundtrack to Tim Burton's 1989 movie), and R.E.M. in a rejected song for the Batman Returns soundtrack, later released under the title \\"Winged Mammal Theme\\", as a B-side to the single \\"Drive\\". In a televised interview with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Prince played the theme on a piano in response to the question, \\"You taught yourself to play at seven years old?

Collins‚Äôs Peerage (1812), volume 6 Political career He was secretary to Lord Burghley, the Lord High Treasurer, and by virtue of his position he was able to take advantage of troubled assets and gradually became a major landowner, especially in Essex. He served as MP for St. Albans in the parliaments of 1586, 1588, 1592 and 1597. \\"He sat on committees concerning recusancy, horse and cattle stealing, privileges, penal laws, painters and stainers, and fustians\\".Jeffery Hankins, Local Government and Society in Early Modern England: Hertfordshire and Essex, c. 1590-1630 (2003) He was also summoned to the parliament of 1601 as a knight of the shire for Essex. He was High Sheriff of Essex in the last year of Elizabeth‚Äôs reign (1603) and was knighted by her. In July 1603, following the accession of James I, he was appointed as Deputy Lieutenant for Essex (the new Lord Lieutenant being the Earl of Sussex). He also developed a reputation as a moneylender. In 1595‚Äì96, he acquired the manor of Tooting Graveney from James Harrington. When the Queen visited in 1600, she was probably his guest.Daniel Lysons, The Environs of London (1792), volume 1 Family He married Susan, the daughter and co-heir of Thomas Pearson, gentleman-usher of the Star Chamber (whose property included two inns in Queen Anne‚Äôs Gate called the White Hart and the Saracen‚Äôs Head Montague Cox, Survey of London, volume 10 (1926)), and had eight sons by her.

Currently the organisation has approximately 8,500 members. The organisation supports the professional development of its members who are involved in the fields of chemistry, life sciences en process technology. The organisation is actively involved in protecting the interests of its members. Furthermore, its supports the development and spread of knowledge and inspiration in the field of chemistry. It publishes journals, books and databases, as well as hosting conferences, seminars and workshops. History In the years of 1896 and 1897, two Dutch chemists Willem Paulinus Jorissen and Johannes Rutten made plans to found an Association of Dutch Chemists. Rutten (1873-1946) had obtained the degree of technologist at the Polytechnic School in Delft (now Delft University of Technology) in 1896 and was appointed chemist at the former Central Guanofabrieken (now AkzoNobel) at Kralingseveer in Rotterdam. Jorissen obtained his PhD degree at the University of Amsterdam on 21 oktober 1896 with Hendrik Willem Bakhuis Roozeboom as supervisor. Rutten and Jorissen became friends and discussed the possibilities of organizing the Dutch chemists. There were already chemical associations in neighboring countries for a long time: the Chemical Society in London was founded in 1841, the Soci√©t√© chimique de France in 1857, the Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft zu Berlin in 1867 and the American Chemical Society in 1876. Denmark followed in 1879, Sweden in 1883, Finland in 1891 and Norway in 1893, while the Soci√©t√© Chimique de Belge was established in Brussels in 1887. In order to successfully establish a Dutch chemical association, it was first of all necessary to find out whether a sufficient number of members could be counted on. Following the medical yearbook for the Netherlands published since 1882, the two friends published a chemical yearbook in 1898 that contained an address list of Dutch chemists at home and abroad. The editors consisted of Jorissen, Rutten, the Amsterdam pharmacist and chemist Bernardus Adrianus van Ketel (1862-1928), H.C. Prinsen Geerligs (born 1864), director of the sugar cane testing station in Kagok, Tegal (Java), and Dr. Lodewijk Theodorus Reicher (1857-1943), chemical mechanic at the Municipal Health Service in Amsterdam and chief of the associated chemical laboratory. The second volume appeared in 1901; the third in 1902. The editorial board was expanded with Dr. Albert Jacques Joseph van de Velde (1871-1956), director of the city laboratory in Ghent. The title therefore became: Scheikundig Jaarboekje voor Nederland, Belgi√´ en Nederlands Indi√´ (English: Chemical Yearbook for the Netherlands, Belgium and the Dutch East Indies). In the meantime, the Journal of Applied Chemistry and Hygiene was founded in 1897 of which Jorissen became co-editor. The chemical yearbook and the journal would play a major role in the founding of the Dutch Chemical Association.De geschiedenis van de scheikunde in Nederland. Deel 1, author: H.A.M. Snelders - website Digital Library for Dutch LiteratureChemisch weekblad, no. 2469, 11 April 1953, Enige herinneringen aan de oprichting van de Nederlandse Chemische Vereniging voor 50 jaren - website of the KNCV The society was founded on 15 April 1903 as the \\"Algemene Nederlandsche Chemische Vereeniging\\" (English: General Netherlands Chemical Society), and renamed on 4 July of the same year as \\"Nederlandsche Chemische Vereeniging\\" (English: Netherlands Chemical Society). At the jubilee of 1953, the organisation was granted a Royal Charter (with the designation \\"Koninklijke\\") by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and thereby became the \\"Koninklijke Nederlandse Chemische Vereniging\\" (English: Royal Netherlands Chemical Society). Membership Membership is open to anyone who works or studies in the chemistry, life sciences or process technology, and endorses the core values for chemists. The board decides on the admission of the members.Kernwaarden - website KNCV The society does have the following categories of membership: *Student Member: Student membership is available for a reduced rate to those who are enrolled at a Dutch college or university as bachelor or master student in chemistry, life sciences or process technology. *Member: Ordinary membership is open to those who work, or have graduated from a Dutch college or university, in the field of chemistry, life sciences or process technology. *Honorary Member: During anniversary years or in special occasions, the society may grant the honorary membership as reward to persons who have rendered special service to the KNCV, to the chemistry community in the Netherlands or Europe, or to chemical sciences in general.Honorary members - website KNCV *Member of Special Merit: Members who have made special contributions to the society through exceptional service or distinctive merit displayed over several years can be appointed ‚Äòmember of special merit‚Äô on recommendation by the Board.Members of special merit - website KNCV *European Chemist (EurChem): The KNCV is one of the member societies of the European Chemical Society (EuChemS) and can as such grant this designation to chemists. Sections and associations The society is organised around 17 sections and associations that are based on subject areas, work groups, and local circles across the Netherlands. The sections and associations cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas:Sections and associations - website of the KNCV * Section Analytical Chemistry: for analytical chemistry and promoting the interests of the analytical-chemical stakeholders and interested parties in the Netherlands. * Section Catalysis (also named 'Dutch Catalysis Society'): representing those active in the field of Catalysis in the Netherlands. * Section Chemistry Education (SSO): for those active in the areas of chemistry education. * Section Environmental Chemistry: representing those working in the area of environmental chemistry. * Section Macromolecules: representing those active in the field of polymer science. * Section Medicinal Chemistry: for everyone involved in medicinal chemistry research. * Section Nanostructures and Self-Assembly (NSA): for those active in the field nanostructures and investigating self-assembly of nanoparticles. * Section Nuclear Chemistry: for everyone involved in the field of radiochemistry. * Section Organic Chemistry (SOC): representing those active in the field of organic chemistry. * Dutch Association for Crystal Growth (NVKG): for those in the field of crystallography and researching crystal growth. * Dutch Biotechnology Association (NBV): the professional association for all professionals in the field of applied life sciences. * Dutch Crystallographic Society (NVK): for anyone in (or from) the Netherlands and Flanders who is interested in crystallography. * Netherlands Ceramics Society (NKV): aimed at the transfer of knowledge and experience in the field of scientific, technical and economic issues concerning ceramic materials and products. * Netherlands Proces Technologists (NPT): community in the Netherlands in the field of process engineering. * Netherlands Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NVBMB): representing those working in the area of biochemistry and molecular biology. * Netherlands Society for Mass Spectrometry: the association in the Netherlands for everyone involved in mass spectrometry. * Network For Food Experts (NVVL): professional association for food experts in the Netherlands and everyone working in the field of food sciences.

R. Bailey. The boat was built in 1915 by Chance Marine Construction Company at Annapolis, Maryland. Though Murray was given the Section Patrol number (SP-1438) while serving both the Conservation Commission and Navy during World War I there is no mention in the Navy records of a commissioned status. The Navy approached the Conservation Commission shortly after the nation's entry into World War I proposing the Commission's boats be used to maintain constant local patrols. The state legislature agreed that the boats and men of the state force would become part of the U.S. Naval Reserve providing they patrol the same districts for fisheries enforcement as well as federal interests with the benefit that patrol time would be increased and the expense for all be paid by the federal government. The Maryland State Fishery Force boats began operating under a contract in which they were under a free lease to the United States Navy in August 1917, serving as Squadron Number 8 of the 5th Naval District, patrolling their regular areas enforcing state conservation law and federal laws. They were under the command of a Conservation Commission member, George O. Haddaway, who was also a Lieutenant in the Navy and expenses, wages, supplies and repairs were paid by the federal government.A number of the boats used in conservation enforcement were private boats used for the season only. These do not seem to be involved. Murray was returned to the Conservation Commission on 26 November 1918. The boat was noted as not being in good condition on return and assigned to the Potomac District by the Conservation Commission.

Antioch College/West was the precursor to programs that later included many campuses formed by Antioch University in San Francisco, California. It was one of many campuses formed by Antioch University, a national university, which had its genesis with Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio in 1852. The San Francisco campus closed in July, 1989. The current campuses include Antioch University New England (Keene NH), Antioch University Midwest, (Yellow Springs, OH), Antioch University Los Angeles, Antioch University Santa Barbara and Antioch University Seattle. Antioch College was closed financial reasons effective June 30, 2008. On September 4, 2009, the college's assets were transferred to an independent corporation known as Antioch College Continuation Corporation (ACCC). ACCC reopened the College as an independent institution in the fall of 2011. It operates under the name \\"Antioch College\\" by virtue of a license from Antioch University. Programs Antioch College/West (the aforementioned precursor to Antioch University/West) San Francisco programs included a \\"design your degree\\" undergraduate program (department head: Tom Parsons) that was noted for giving academic credit for evaluated life experience. Graduate programs such as Health Services Administration, Clinical Psychology (department head - Noele Krenkel), Holistic Psychology (department head: noted author and Esalen- associated psychologist, Dr. Will Shutz), Somatic Psychology (department heads: Don Johnson and Michael Khan), Feminist Studies (department heads: Lauree Moss and Ani Mander), Community Planning (Department Head: David Keilch) among other diverse programs. Antioch College/West was founded in a yellow brick building on 9th Street between Mission and Market Street in the early 1970s. When the university outgrew its 9th Street space in 1972 it moved to warehouse space on Mission Street between 7th & 8th Streets. Students built a darkroom and had art classes and studio space on the 4th floor of the warehouse. For a time students were involved in urban gardening on the roof where chickens were also raised. Sometime after 1975 the college moved to space in the Cogswell College building on Stockton Street above the Stockton Street Tunnel where it remained until 1985. In 1989, the school moved to 50 Fell Street, leasing space from New College of California.

Data from STSS satellites could allow interceptors to engage incoming missiles earlier in flight than would be possible with other missile detection systems. The STSS program began in 2001, when the \\"SBIRS Low\\" program was transferred to MDA from the United States Air Force. Launch One of the two satellites had been shipped to Cape Canaveral 4 May 2009; the second satellite arrived at the launch site on 25 June 2009. Two demonstration satellites were launched together on a single Delta II launch vehicle. Launch took place 25 September 2009, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17. STSS constellation consists of two satellites orbiting at 1350 km, 58¬∞ inclination, with 120 minute orbital period.https://www.mda.mil/global/documents/pdf/stss.pdf (27 March 2017) It was reported that several items of debris, identified by amateur satellite watchers as remnants of the Delta-2 launch vehicle, had crashed in a field in Mongolia on 19 February 2010. Early detection The perceived advantage of STSS is that its satellites, by operating at a lower altitude and by using long- and short-wave infrared sensors, will be able to acquire and track missiles in midcourse and during the boost phase. The role of STSS STSS is designed to be the low earth orbiter (LEO) within the layered Ballistic Missile Defense System.

He attempted to take advantage of the turmoil in Rome after the death of Nero to set up an independent Gaulish state. After his defeat he was hidden for many years by his wife Epponina. The story of the couple, with emphasis on the loyalty of Epponina (known as \\"√âponine\\"), became popular in France during the 18th and 19th centuries. Rebellion He was a Roman officer, naturalized, as indicated by his name. He claimed to be the great-grandson of Julius Caesar on the grounds that his great-grandmother had been Caesar's lover during the Gallic war.Tacitus, Histories 4.55 In AD 69, benefiting from the period of disorders which shook the Roman Empire and the rebellion started on the Rhine by the Batavians, he started a revolt in Belgian Gaul. However, his badly organised forces were easily defeated by the Sequani who were still faithful to Rome. Following his defeat, he faked his own death by telling his servants that he intended to kill himself. He then burned down the villa in which he was staying. He went into hiding in a nearby cellar, known only to his wife Epponina and a few faithful servants. Following the failure of the revolt, the territory of Lingons was detached from Belgian Gaul, and was placed under the direct monitoring of the Roman army of the Rhine. It formed thus part of Roman province of Germania Superior. In hiding √âponine et Sabinus (1802) by Nicolas-Andr√© MonsiauEpponina then lived a double-life for many years as his widow, while also on one occasion even visiting Rome with Sabinus disguised as a slave. She even gave birth to two sons by her \\"deceased\\" husband. According to Plutarch she minimised her pregnancy using an ointment that made her flesh swell, concealing her pregnancy bump. She also gave birth alone and in secret. Eventually, the deception became too obvious to continue unnoticed. In AD 78 Sabinus and Epponina were arrested and taken to Rome to be questioned by the emperor Vespasian. Her pleas for her husband were ignored. She then berated Vespasian to such an extent that he ordered her execution along with her husband. Plutarch later wrote that \\"In the whole of his reign no darker deed than this, none more odious in the sight of heaven, was committed.\\"Plutarch, On Lovers. Her two sons survived. Plutarch mentions that at the time he was writing one lived in Delphi and the other had recently been killed in Egypt (possibly in the Kitos War). Cultural references The modernised French version of Epponina's name, √âponine, became familiar in revolutionary France, because of its connotations of wifely virtue, patriotism and anti-imperialism. Voltaire speaks of Plutarch's \\"magnificent praise for the virtue of Eponine.‚ÄùCatherine Cl√©ment and Julia, Kristeva (Jane Marie Todd, trans), The Feminine and the Sacred, Columbia University Press, New York, 2001, p.45. Even before the revolution there were several French works about Sabinus and √âponine. Michel-Paul-Gui de Chabanon's tragedy √âponine was performed in 1762. It formed the basis for Sabinus, an opera in five acts composed by Fran√ßois-Joseph Gossec, premiered at Versailles on 4 December 1773.Spire Pitou, The Paris Opera: An Encyclopedia of Operas, Ballets, Composers, and Performers, Volume: 1, Greenwood Press, Westport, CT, 1983, p.481. After the revolution Eponine et Sabinus (1796) was performed at the Lyc√©e theatre.Emmet Kennedy et al, Theatre, Opera, and Audiences in Revolutionary Paris: Analysis and Repertory, Greenwood Press, Westport, CT, 1996, pp 276; 377. De Lisle de Salles' novel √âponine led to his imprisonment during the Reign of Terror, as it was interpreted as an attack on the Committee of Public Safety.P H Ditchfield, Books Fatal to Their Authors, Echo Library, 200, p.40. In his novel Les Mis√©rables, the French author Victor Hugo used the name for √âponine, a character who also aspires to die with her own beloved in a revolution. Epponina also appears as \\"√âponine\\" in Baudelaire's poem Little old Ladies from Les Fleurs du Mal in a verse dedicated to Hugo: These dislocated wrecks were women once, Were Eponine or La√Øs! hunchbacked freaks, Though broken let us love them! they are souls.James McGowan (trans), Charles Baudelaire, The Flowers of Evil, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1998, p.371. The Cave of SabinusThere were several paintings of the couple, including works by Nicolas-Andr√© Monsiau and Etienne Barth√©l√©my Garnier. These usually depict them hiding in a cave, a reference to a myth that a cave near Langres was the place in which Sabinus had hidden. It is still locally known as \\"Sabinus' cave\\" (Grotte de Sabinus). Joseph Mills Hanson, who visited it shortly after World War I, described it as a \\"cave in the rock having two entrances, the one looking south, the other east. The interior is very irregular in outline but it is perhaps fifty feet deep, twenty feet wide, and seven feet high. Near the east entrance is a rough pillar, left evidently by the cutting away of the surrounding stone.\\" A statue of the Virgin Mary was placed there, along with graffiti left by American soldiers in the war.Joseph Mills Hanson, The Marne, historic and picturesque, McClurg, 1922, p.9.

In 1965 he joined his first group, The Volcanoes, alongside Al Brown, the pair staying together until 1969. Malcolm then gave up music while he continued his studies, but returned when he joined the group Big Relations, led by Jo Jo Bennett. Malcolm recorded briefly as a solo artist, recording \\"Father Free Us\\" for Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd's Studio One label, before spending time in the United States. On his return to Jamaica he was employed by Rupie Edwards as the branch manager of the Success Records shop at Half Way Tree. He also began recording again, including the 1973 single \\"No Jestering\\", and the follow-up \\"Miss Wire Waist\\", which topped the UK reggae chart when it was issued there in 1975. He had his greatest success in September 1975 with \\"Fattie Bum-Bum\\". This was picked up for release by independent label UK Records after Dave Cash started to play it on his Capital Radio programme, and it quickly got to number 2 on the station's 'Hitline' listeners' chart. It eventually reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. It remained in the chart for eight weeks. The track was written by Malcolm and produced by Clive Chin. It had been copied in a cover version by the UK group The Diversions, which also charted (reaching #34), diverting some sales away from Malcolm's version.

It remains in force in England and Wales, and anyone found to be sleeping in a public place or to be trying to beg for money can be arrested. Contemporary critics, including William Wilberforce, condemned the Act for being a catch-all offence because it did not consider the circumstances as to why an individual might be placed in such a predicament. Background The law was enacted to deal with the increasing numbers of homeless and penniless urban poor in England and Wales following the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Nine years after the Battle of Waterloo the British Army and British Navy had undergone a massive reduction in size, leaving large numbers of discharged military personnel without jobs or accommodation. Many were living rough on the streets or in makeshift camps. At the same time a massive influx of economic migrants from Ireland and Scotland arrived in England, especially London, in search of work. Politicians in the unreformed House of Commons became concerned that parish constables were becoming ineffective in controlling these \\"vagrants\\". Further, the medieval pass laws which gave itinerant travelling people free movement through a given district were considered to be no longer effective. Offences Punishment for the wide definition of vagrancy (including prostitution) was up to one month's hard labour. The Act of 1824 was amended several times, most notably by the Vagrancy Act 1838, which introduced a number of new public order offences covering acts that were deemed at the time to be likely to cause moral outrage. It contained a provision for the prosecution of \\"every Person wilfully exposing to view, in any Street... or public Place, any obscene Print, Picture, or other indecent Exhibition\\".HC Deb 25 June 1991 c861. Although the Act of 1824 originally applied only to England and Wales, Section 4 of the Act, which dealt mainly with vagrancy and begging, was extended to Scotland and Ireland by section 15 of the Prevention of Crimes Act 1871. The Vagrancy Act 1898 prohibited soliciting or importuning for immoral purposes. Originally intended as a measure against prostitution, in practice the legislation was almost solely used to convict men for gay sex. The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912, extended provisions of the 1824 Act to Scotland and Ireland, and suppressed brothels.The Law Reform Commission (1985). Report on Vagrancy and Related Offences (Dublin: LRC (Ireland)) p. 6f. Current status The majority of the original Vagrancy Act 1824 remains in force in England and Wales. In 1982 the entire Act was repealed in Scotland by the Civic Government (Scotland) Act. Section 18 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 (Ireland) repealed section 4 of the 1824 Act (begging and vagrancy) in Ireland. An attempt was made in 1981 Hansard: HC Deb 24 February 1981 vol 999 cc756-8 to repeal Section 4 (and so, in effect, decriminalise begging and homelessness) in England and Wales, but the bill (the Vagrancy Offences (Repeal) Bill) did not progress beyond first reading. Under the Act discharged military personnel continue to be granted exemption certificates allowing them to appeal for alms under certain circumstances. =Modern use= In 1988 some 573 people were prosecuted and convicted under the Act in England and Wales, rising to 1,396 by 1989. In May 1990 the National Association of Probation Officers carried out a survey of prosecutions under the Act. That survey revealed that 1,250 prosecutions had been dealt with in 14 magistrates courts in Central London in 1988, which represented an enormous leap in the number of prosecutions under the Act, especially in London. In 2014 three men were arrested and charged under Section 4 of the 1824 Vagrancy Act for stealing food that had been put in skips and bins outside an Iceland supermarket in Kentish Town, North London. Paul May, William James and Jason Chan were due to stand trial after allegedly taking cheese, tomatoes and cakes worth ¬£33 from bins behind the shop. The Iceland chain denied any involvement in contacting the police, and in a public statement it questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) felt that it was in the public interest to pursue a case against the three individuals. The three men, all of no fixed address, were due to attend a hearing at Highbury Magistrates' Court on 3 February 2014. However, before that date the CPS announced its decision to drop the case, stating that it felt it had not given due weight to the public interest factors tending against prosecution.

He is regarded as the founder of the so-called Bokemeyer collection (German: S√§mmlung Bokemeyer) which is now housed in the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin and is considered one of the most important music collections of the late 17th and early 18th century. LifeYouth (1664‚Äì1686)= The Johanniskirche in Magdeburg where √ñsterreich was baptized √ñsterreich was born in March 1664, the son of brewer Johann (or Hans) √ñsterreich and Elisabeth √ñsterreich and was baptized on March 17 in the Johanniskirche in Magdeburg. The √ñsterreich family came originally from Augsburg and belonged to a very distinguished patrician family. In 1552, they fell out of favor with the Emperor when they tried to reinstate the guild government which had been in place prior to 1547. As a result, they lost many of the rights associated with their position and were forced to leave Augsburg. A majority of the family settled in Central Germany. √ñsterreich received his first musical education from his godfather, the Magdeburg cantor Johann Scheffler, who also instructed Johann Theile and was one of the most respected musicians of his time. However, little is known of Scheffler's life and there is no record of his skill as a composer. √ñsterreich appears to have been very musically gifted and in 1678, at age 14, he applied, with a letter of recommendation from Scheffler, for a position at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig (St. Thomas School of Leipzig) where his brother, Michael, had also attended. The headmaster of the school noted in his diary: \\"Michael Oesterreich [...] presented to me his brother Georg (entering his 14th year) son of Johann, townsman and beer brewer in Magdeburg: to date has gone to school in Magdeburg and sat in Class II. [...] In music, the cantor gave him praise and a good recommendation.\\" √ñsterreich committed to attend the Thomasschule for at least two years and offered to stay many more years. His teacher at this time was the cantor Johann Schelle, who recognized the exceptional abilities of his young student and granted him as much support as possible. He soon became an important part of the weekly choir at the St. Thomas Church. In the summer of 1680, the plague broke out in Leipzig. Despite strict safety measures by the school leadership, many at the school fell ill. A general panic spread, and the students who had not yet fallen ill fled the city. Among them were Georg and his brother Michael, who returned to Magdeburg. At that point, √ñsterreich's parents sent him to Hamburg, to the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums to continue his education, which was being led at that time by the Baroque composer, Joachim Gerstenb√ºttel. On account of his voice, √ñsterreich soon achieved a modest celebrity in Hamburg and was hired as an alto in the council choir. In this position he took part in all the important religious and secular celebrations in the city and made the acquaintance of influential merchants and townspeople. Exactly how long √ñsterreich kept his position in Hamburg is not certain. Likely the breaking of his voice brought on the end of this position. In the fall of 1683, he enrolled at Leipzig University, though this was probably only to fill the time as his voice finished changing, because by the end of 1684 he was once again working as a singer, now as a tenor, in the Oper am G√§nsemarkt theater in Hamburg. =Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (1686‚Äì1689)= Engraving of Wolfenb√ºttel Castle in 1654 Critical for √ñsterreich's career was his lifelong friendship with Johann Theile. When the arts-lover Anton Ulrich was appointed co-regent of the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel and made funds available for the fine arts, it was Theile who attached √ñsterreich to the Wolfenb√ºttel court, took him into his house, and gave him lessons in composition. Alongside this, √ñsterreich continued his voice studies with two Italian castrati who were also at the court, Giuliano Giuliani and Vincentino Antonini. His time at Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel was a formative period in every respect and marked the beginning of his activity as a composer. His first works date from the years 1687 and 1688. These three religious concertos, \\"Laetatus sum in his,\\" \\"Levavi oculos meos,\\" and \\"Ich will den Hern Loben allezeit\\" more strongly reflect the contrapuntal tradition of Johann Theile. His official duties at court were limited to participation as a tenor in the ducal choir and duties as a \\"Cammer-Diener\\", a page (servant) or valet. He had no official duties as a composer, though his works of the time were almost certainly performed in the court church. In Wolfenb√ºttel, he married Magdalena Darnedden, the daughter of a brewer, on 15 October 1689, shortly before his move to Schleswig. His father-in-law, Hans Darnedden, was successful and respected and left the couple a house, a garden, and a considerable sum of money at his death in 1702. =Schleswig (1689‚Äì1702)= Gottorf Castle, where √ñsterreich worked from 1689 to 1702 At the end of the 17th century, the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp was in an extremely unstable political situation. Several times, the dukes had been forced out of their residence in Schleswig into exile in Hamburg. These exiles generally led to a large reduction, if not the dissolution of the court's musical ensemble. In 1689, Duke Christian Albrecht had been in exile in Hamburg for years when King Christian V of Denmark and Norway was forced by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor to sign the so-called \\"Altonaer Vergleich\\" (Altona Compromise) which permitted Christian Albrecht to return to Schleswig. Johann Philipp F√∂rtsch had officially been the Duke's Kapellmeister (music director) since 1680 but had probably only sporadically performed any duties related to this office because of the exile. In the meantime, he had begun pursuing a medical career and was already serving as a court physician for his employer and did not intend to resume his activity as Kapellmeister. With the return of the court to Schleswig, however, it became necessary to find a capable person to fill the position. F√∂rtsch, who had worked with Theile and √ñsterreich for a time at the Hamburger Oper, suggested √ñsterreich for this post. √ñsterreich led his first performance as the Gottorfer Hofkapellmeister not later than the Advent season of 1689. During his tenure, the Gottorfer court ensemble became one of the most important in the German-speaking world. Interval in Coburg Engraving of Duke Frederick IV of Holstein-Gottorp from 1703 The surviving works of the Gottorfer Court Ensemble testify to a high level of musical performance. However, the period of flourishing was cut short when Christian Albrecht died on 27 December 1694. His son, Frederick IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, then 23 years old, soon began dismissing members of the ensemble in order to increase his military expenditures. As a result, the courtly music was disrupted and √ñsterreich assumed a position as Kapellmeister in Coburg from 1695 to 1697. The exact details of this position are not entirely known. It is possible it was merely a \\"loan\\" of his services for the time that the Gottorfer Court Ensemble was dormant since the Gottorfer accounts reflect salary payments of 80 reichsthaler during that period - a fraction of his full salary which had been 350 reichsthaler in 1694. Musical historian Johann Gottfried Walther described it somewhat differently in 1732; according to Walther, Albert V, Duke of Saxe-Coburg had invited √ñsterreich to his Coburg residence and commissioned some of his work \\"to be used at festivities of the time.\\" The Duke was so enthusiastic about √ñsterreich that he invited him to stay to replace his recently deceased court Kapellmeister. Veste Coburg, the former seat of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg Whether by a temporary appointment or an invitation from the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, √ñsterreich desired to remain in Coburg on account of the relatively stable political situation. Frederick IV, however, did not want to lose √ñsterreich permanently and promised that if he would return to his old position in Schleswig, he would reverse the cutbacks to the court's music budget. It is not clear whether the Duke kept his promise. Some documents from the period 1698 to 1702 reference the court ensemble and works from the time would require a considerable number of performers. However, court accounts reflect salaries only for the Kapellmeister and one organist, though it may be the case that non-resident musicians were used for larger performances and were paid by the project. Decline of the Gottorfer Court Ensemble In 1701, when Frederick IV set off to the east to serve at the side of his brother-in- law Karl XII of Sweden in the Northern War, the court at Schleswig was dissolved once again. Only √ñsterreich retained his position, though the duke permitted him to leave and make his living by music elsewhere as long as he returned and resumed his duties as soon as the court was reconstituted. In the meantime, √ñsterreich had inherited a brewery in Brunswick from his father-in- law where he moved with his family in 1702. But in December of that year, he had to resume his duties in Gottorf for Frederick IV's burial after he was killed in the Battle of Klissow. =Brunswick Wolfenb√ºttel (1702‚Äì1735)= 1747 Etching of the Brunswick Opera House It is difficult to reconstruct √ñsterreich's employment after he moved to Brunswick. Initially, he and his family probably lived off of the inheritance from his father-in-law and the income from the brewery. However, as a 1704 letter shows, these savings began to run short and √ñsterreich would have needed to find a new position even if he had not been dismissed from service in Gottorf. One biographer writes that he participated in the church music and took over as cantor of the castle church but his position as castle cantor can only be confirmed from 1724, though it cannot be ruled out that he held the position earlier. It is certainly the case that √ñsterreich was participating in opera performances at the Theater am Hagenmarkt in Brunswick by at least 1708, when he was named in connection with a staging of Georg Caspar Sch√ºrmann's \\"Der erfreuten Ocker Sch√§fer eingestelltes Fest,\\" though he was likely involved earlier than that. The opera was founded by Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in 1690 and staged productions twice a year during the local fairs. √ñsterreich continued to work in connection with the opera until at least 1721. In Brunswick Wolfenb√ºttel, √ñsterreich came into contact with the modern musical currents of the age. In the late 17th century, the French style of Kapellmeister Johann Sigismund Kusser was the fashion. However, at the beginning of the 18th century, a dramatic shift took place when, in 1701, the Duke sent Sch√ºrmann to study in Italy to adapt to the new musical tastes. √ñsterreich was not unaffected by these changes. He also changed his musical vocabulary drastically. Unfortunately, few works from this transitional period (1704-1719) survive, so the development of his style can only be partially reconstructed. In addition to his duties as singer, cantor, and singing instructor, √ñsterreich also taught composition, passing on what he had learned from Johann Theile, above all regarding counterpoint. His most important student was Heinrich Bokemeyer who was Cantor at the princely Schule zu Wolfenb√ºttel and from 1739 was a member of Lorenz Christoph Mizler's Corresponding Society of Musical Sciences. How long Bokemeyer was √ñsterreich's student is not known (the documents state \\"around 1706\\") but they developed a close friendship. In the 1720s, √ñsterreich successively sold Bokemeyer the music collection, primarily church music, that he had established in Gottorf. Bokemeyer added to the collection with mainly secular works from contemporary composers. At least half of the collection survives today and is maintained by the Berlin State Library. It includes currently 1,839 titles, which are primarily scores. Most musicologists call it the \\"Bokemeyer Collection\\" though 1,702 of the works go back to the Gottorf collection, rendering the name somewhat misleading. It is written in various places that √ñsterreich held the position of vice-Kapellmeister in Wolfenb√ºttel. However, this cannot be confirmed in surviving contemporary documents, as many archives of the time were lost or destroyed during the world wars. In any event, it appears that at the very least he held such a position in a de facto form, even if he was never formally appointed. By the end of the 1720s, in his mid-sixties, √ñsterreich was gradually withdrawing from the musical events in Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel, likely not least due to the growing popularity of Italian composers and the changes in fashionable tastes. On 9 May 1735, Georg Caspar Sch√ºrmann was sent into retirement by the new Duke, Ferdinand Albert II, who found his style too old-fashioned. √ñsterreich was supposed to remain in his position as court cantor, but died a few weeks later. His death is recorded in the court's church register for 6 June 1735: \\"in the evening at 10 o'clock, after a short illness, died gently and peacefully, and was buried on the 10th.\\" Children √ñsterreich had four children with his wife Magdalena: *Johann Samuel (25 May 1691 ‚Äì 27 May 1712) *Anton August (19 December 1692 ‚Äì 1745) *Georg Christoph (5 November 1694 ‚Äì 1762) *Sophie Amalie (20 June 1696 ‚Äì ?) The social standing which he attained in his position as court Kapellmeister is apparent in the list of his children's godparents. Among them are found such prominent names as Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel; crown prince and later duke Augustus William of Brunswick- L√ºneburg; and Augustus William's second wife, Sophie Amalie, born Duchess of Holstein-Gottorf, in addition to √ñsterreich's predecessor and teacher Johann Theile. √ñsterreich's sons all pursued careers in the church and held high ecclesiastical offices in northern Germany. Only his daughter, Sophie Amalie, devoted herself to music and became a celebrated opera singer at the Brunswick Theater. Biographical sources √ñsterreich's family tree was reconstructed in the 20th century. His last known direct descendant was the wife of a major general in the German Army who lived in Blankenburg (Harz). She died childless in the 1950s. In the possession of the family were several letters of √ñsterreich's along with a handwritten autobiography in his own hand. A student at the time, Adam Soltys, was writing his dissertation on √ñsterreich in 1922. This document came to his attention and he cited it several times in his work. Despite intensive searches, the present whereabouts of the manuscript have not been ascertained. The only reliable sources of information about √ñsterreich's life are letters and the records of the courts where he was employed. The state archive in Schleswig maintains many valuable documents from √ñsterreich's time in Gottorf, while a majority of the archive of Brunswick-Wolfenb≈´ttel was lost in World War II. Another important biographical source is the article on √ñsterreich in Johann Gottfried Walther's Musicalisches Lexicon from 1732. Based on the detail in the article, it can be assumed that he received his information from √ñsterreich himself. It is possible √ñsterreich wrote his biography specially for Walther and accordingly some statements, particularly those regarding his motives for his various changes of employment must be treated with caution. Reputation Georg √ñsterreichs handwritten score of Nicolaus Bruhns‚Äô cantata Die Zeit meines Abschieds ist vorhanden Harald K√ºmmerling, a musicologist who has researched and catalogued the Bokemeyer collection, writing in the musical encyclopedia Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, was critical of √ñsterreich's work, saying \\"√ñsterreich, like, Gustaf D√ºben was a great collector but a sterile composer.\\" It is true, D√ºben's and √ñsterreich's passion for collecting ‚Äì D√ºben in Sweden and √ñsterreich in Gottorf and Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel ‚Äì is almost unique in the history of music. These great musical libraries are of enormous value, providing unique insight into the musical practice of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Thanks to his collection, the works of famous composers like Dietrich Buxtehude, Nicolaus Bruhns, Johann Rosenm√ºller, Matthias Weckmann, Vincent L√ºbeck, and Johann Philipp Krieger, among others have been preserved. For √ñsterreich, counterpoint and canon were concrete manifestations of the \\"order of God\\" (Ordnung Gottes), their elaboration revealing the divine, inscrutable essence of God's creation, not merely as a metaphor for His order, but as the concrete actualization of that order.Bach and the Meanings of Counterpoint. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. √ñsterreich was certainly not a particularly innovative composer but he understood his work very well and was held in high regard during his lifetime.

That same year the Hamilton King Forestors OC organized a World Cup race in the Dundas Valley and Denise Demonte of the Hamilton King Forestors claimed 4th place, a best ever World Cup result by a North American. In 1990 two major international events were held in Canada, the Asia-Pacific Orienteering Championships in British Columbia, and a World Cup race in Caroline hosted by the Alberta Orienteering Association. In 1992 Canada hosted its third World Cup race in Ganaraska Forest, Newcastle Ontario. In 2000 the Orienteering Association of New Brunswick (ONB) held, in conjunction with the Canadian Orienteering Championships, Canada's first two World Ranking Events in Rockwood Park, Saint John, and Fundy National Park. In 2002 the Asia-Pacific Orienteering Championships returned to Canada, this time in Alberta. In 2005 the Alberta Orienteering Association hosts another major international event, the World Masters Orienteering Championships. That same year Canadian Sandy Hott placed 9th in the middle distance at the WOC, a new best result by a North American at the WOC and a then best ever result by a female non-European. In 2006 the Saskatchewan Orienteering Association joined Orienteering Canada and hosted the Canadian Orienteering Championships a year later. In 2011 Orienteering Canada introduced the concept of Canada Cup Events and the Canada Cup Elite Series. In 2016, Emily Kemp earned the best ever North American placing at WOC, coming 4th in the middle distance. http://www.woc2016.se/en/ Affiliated clubs *Alberta **Alberta Orienteering Association **Foothills Orienteering (Calgary) **Edmonton Overlanders Orienteering Club *British Columbia **Orienteering Association of British Columbia **Greater Vancouver Orienteering Club **Kootenay Orienteering Club (Cranbrook, Kimberly) **Sage Orienteering & Rogaining Club (Kamloops, Salmon Arm, Revelstoke) **Victoria Orienteering Club **Williams Lake Orienteering Club *Manitoba **Manitoba Orienteering Association *New Brunswick **Orienteering New Brunswick *Nova Scotia **Orienteering Association of Nova Scotia **Annapolis Valley Orienteering Club **Halifax Orienteering Club *Ontario **Orienteering Ontario **DontGetLost Adventure Running (Hamilton) **Orienteering Ottawa (Ottawa- Gatineau) **Stars Orienteering Club (Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge) **Toronto Orienteering Club **Ukrainian Orienteering Club (Toronto) *Prince Edward Island **Orienteering PEI (chapter of Orienteering New Brunswick) *Quebec **Orientering Quebec **Accro O Sport (Granby) **Azimut Laurentides Club (Morin Heights) **Le Club de courses d‚Äôaventure et d‚Äôorientation de la Gasp√©sie (Gasp√©) **Ramblers Orienteering Club (Montreal) **Orienteering Ottawa (Ottawa- Gatineau) *Yukon **Yukon Orienteering Association ReferencesExternal links *Official website of Orienteering Canada Category:International Orienteering Federation members Orienteering ","title":"Canadian Orienteering Federation"},{"id":"18045160","text":"Founded in 1990, Healthy Dining is a California-based company offering nutrition analysis services for the restaurant and foodservice industries and is the nutrition partner of the National Restaurant Association.Healthy Dining LogoHealthy Dining is staffed by registered dietitians, researchers, and communication and digital professionals who serve as a Menu Labeling partner for restaurants and provide the following nutrition services: * Menu Labeling Compliance * Nutrition Analysis * Gluten and Allergen Identification * Vegetarian and Vegan Identification * Recipe and Menu Consultation * Laboratory Nutrient Analysis * Nutrition Information Accuracy Audits  Healthy Dining Finder HealthyDiningFinder.com is an online resource and search tool operated by Healthy Dining that provides guidance in choosing dietitian-approved Healthy Dining menu items and corresponding nutrition information for menu items served at more than 60,000 full-service and quick- serve restaurant locations in the US.

It was originally formed as a confederation of state based labour parties known as the Pan-Malayan Labour Party or PMLP. HistoryOrigins= The LPM's roots lay in the state labour parties that were established after the British government announced plans to organise local elections in 1950. In 1952, representatives from the state parties, 21 trade unions and the Malay left-leaning organisation SABERKAS (or Syarikat Berkerjasama Am Saiburi, not to be confused with the present day SABERKAS in Sarawak) met in Kuala Lumpur and decided to form the PMLP. This organisation initially took an anti-communist stand but was not overtly anti-colonial. The party joined the Socialist International as a member.Rose, Saul. Socialism in Southern Asia.

The LPM, however, managed to capture the City Council of Georgetown in Penang in the 1956 local elections with a majority of eight seats. According to the party's own accounts it had more or less the same number of Malay and Chinese members, but very few Indians or people from other communities. The party identified itself as a non-communal party. It considered that the Alliance government represented capitalist and feudal groups.D.S. Ramanathan.

The LPM also proposed for the abolishment of special privileges for any ethnic group, federal nationality to supersede state nationality, the use of Malay as the national language and English as a second language, the merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, the limiting the powers of the Malay rulers, an elected presidency, and a secular state. =Post- Independence= In view of the changed circumstances after the independence of Malaya in 1957, the LPM amended its constitution in 1959 to strive for the establishment of a united democratic socialist state of Malaya and to secure for the workers who work by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible, upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service (the latter part essentially mirroring the then Clause IV of the British Labour Party's constitution).

His five crime novels, known as the Budapest Noir series, depict the adventures of a journalist, Zsigmond Gordon, in Budapest from the 1930s to the 1950s. They have become very popular in Hungary. BiographyPersonal life= Kondor attended university in Szeged, then continued his studies in Paris. He graduated in chemical engineering from the Sorbonne, then returned to Hungary. Currently he teaches mathematics and physics at a high school. He lives with his wife, daughters and dog in a small village near Sopron. He leads a quiet life and, if he gives interviews at all, he does so only by email. =Professional life= Kondor worked for three years on his first published novel, Budapest Noir. It was his fourth finished manuscript. Kondor finished the Budapest Noir series with the fifth novel, Budapest novemberben (Budapest in November), published in June 2012. As influences, Kondor has mentioned Jim Thompson, Charles Willeford and Dashiell Hammett, and he based one of his characters, V√∂r√∂s Marg√≥ (Red Margot) on the character Dinah Brand in Hammett's novel Red Harvest. WorksBudapest Noir= A Jewish girl is found dead in Budapest in 1936, and, Zsigmond Gordon, a determined crime reporter, sets out to solve a murder that everyone else in his soon-to-be Fascist country wants to leave buried. Budapest Noir received a warm reception in Hungary, and many reviewers hailed it as the first true hardboiled crime story written in Hungarian. One critic. P√©ter I. R√°cz, welcomed Kondor as the author of the first Hungarian crime thriller.http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=KRITIKA0809&article;=2008-0302-1957-55XVIQ > \\"The search [for a Hungarian crime thriller] is at an end: Vilmos Kondor‚Äôs > novel is a Hungarian crime thriller and then some, one of the harder > variety, in the spirit of Chandler and Hammett, but with Hungarian > characters and set in the Hungarian capital in the period before World War > II. ... Kondor‚Äôs literary experiment has been a great success: the Hungarian > hard-boiled crime thriller has been born, and, far predating its own period, > it leads its readers ‚Äì with an effect that 'carries into the present' ‚Äì to > the literary realm of the 1930s.\\" √âS. The rights for a film adaptation of Budapest Noir were sold before the book was published. Shooting of the film was set for early 2013. Translations of Budapest Noir have been published by Edizioni e/o in Italy, Payot et Rivages in France, Proszynski i S-ka in Poland, Droemer Knaur in Germany, Mynx in the Netherlands, and HarperCollins in the UK. =B≈±n√∂s Budapest (Sinful Budapest)= The sequel to Budapest Noir was published in June 2009 by Agave K√∂nyvek. The story is set in the fall of 1939, a couple of weeks after the outbreak of World War II. and features Zsigmond Gordon and S√°ndor Nemes, a retired detective. They start investigating two different cases: Gordon wants to find out why a former colleague and friend has died, while Nemes is hired to find out what happened to a huge quantity of cocaine and morphine that has gone missing. The two cases merge, and the solution involves politicians, Hungarian Nazis and corrupt policemen. One reviewer, P√©ter Urfi, wrote about the \\"Kondor phenomenon\\":http://www.narancs.hu/index.php?gcPage=/public/hirek/hir.php&id;=19143 > ‚ÄúIn the Hungarian book market, developments as joyful as the Kondor > phenomenon are rare. Kondor is a professional genre author: he knows exactly > what a hard-boiled crime novel should be like, and how to write one.

A critic called the novel a \\"time machine\\". http://est.hu/cikk/81503/kondor_vilmos_a_budapesti_kem > \\"All those who have never daydreamed about travelling back in time with a > time machine to change the course of certain events, raise your hand. If any > of you wish to relive Hungary as it was in the 1940s, then by all means pick > up Vilmos Kondor‚Äôs latest novel, which not only reveals practical espionage > facts, but also depicts the operation and circumstances reigning within the > secret services of a country being driven into war.\\" =Budapest romokban (Budapest in Ruins)= After the horrors of World War II, Hungary is about to become a democracy, but in the summer of 1946 an assassin strikes in the middle of Budapest, and the consequences are more dire than anyone would dare to think. Gordon starts to investigate the real culprits, who turn out to be, not the criminal lords of the capital, but ruthless Soviet officers and their even more ruthless masters. A reviewer emphasized that Kondor writes about a kind of freedom that has not been common in Hungary:http://www.es.hu/szilasi_laszlo;ex_libris;2011-09-28.html > ‚ÄúWithout Vilmos Kondor‚Äôs work the acts of the man socialized for freedom > (with all it consequences) couldn‚Äôt be studied in Hungarian texts.‚Äù =Budapest novemberben (Budapest in November)= October 1956 finds Gordon in exile in Vienna, where he is asked to identify a dead body as his adopted daughter. Even though the girl turns out to be someone else, Gordon ‚Äì along with Krisztina ‚Äì hops on the last train to Budapest, where a revolution has just started, tanks are rolling onto the streets, and people are dying by the hundreds. But Gordon is interested only in finding his daughter, and the dangerous killer who tries to stay hidden while chaos ensues on the streets of a city that is fighting for its independence and freedom. A reviewer welcomed the way Kondor handles history in this final novel in the Budapest Noir series:http://konyves.blog.hu/2012/08/14/kondor_vilmos_megalapozta_a_magyar_krimit > \\"Kondor doesn't only paint a picture and doesn't only repeat what is in the > history books: he tries to interpret it, make sense of it, and help us > understand the relations and dynamics of this hectic era.\\" =Short stories= Kondor has been publishing short stories since 2009. A collection was compiled in late 2012 for publication in 2013. Style and method Kondor always uses a third-person narrative that is arguably a masked first-person narrative, since the reader always sees what the protagonist(s) see. The narrator is also an historical figure who knows only the time frame of the novel and never steps out of it. Kondor thus views events through the eyes of his protagonists, and rarely comments on the political situation. He follows in the steps of Charles Willeford in the sense that his characters never \\"think\\", they only \\"act\\": there are no inner monologues. Kondor mixes fictional characters with persons from real life, including Le√≥ V√©csey (journalist), Korn√©l T√°bori (journalist), Tibor Ferenczy (police commissioner), P√©ter Hain (detective), Tibor Wayand (detective), Istv√°n B√°rczy (chief of staff), and Vilmos Tarj√°n (journalist). He thoroughly researches people and events in order to invoke the atmosphere of Hungary, and especially Budapest, in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

'Sutton' means 'south farmstead' in relation to Norton Bavant, one mile () to the north. 'Veny' may be a French family name or may describe the village's fenny situation. The parish is bounded in the northeast by the Wylye, and in the east includes part of the village of Tytherington. In 1885 when the small parish of Pertwood was extinguished, its northern section was transferred to Sutton Veny.  History  Prehistory = The upper Wylye area has much evidence of Neolithic and early Bronze Age activity. There are several bowl barrows, one of them close to the east of the present village. To the west of the village, by the Longbridge Deverill road, is the site of a henge which survives as an earthwork, 80m in diameter. It was noted by Sir Richard Colt Hoare and sketched by William Cunnington. Robin Hood's Bower, in the middle of Southleigh wood, is an earthwork enclosure of uncertain date and purpose. Several Iron Age enclosures have been found on Cow Down, southwest of Sutton Veny village, including a D-shape bank and ditch, where partial excavation found evidence of a circular wooden hut. = Roman period = A Roman villa site with two buildings is at Pit Meads, near the Wylye in the north of the parish. The site of a Romano-British village is on Tytherington Hill, in the southeast. = Later = Domesday Book in 1086 recorded three manors at Sutone or Sudtone, with 43 households and a mill. By 1294 there were two townships: Great Sutton around St Leonard's church, and Little Sutton to the west, towards Tytherington. From the 14th century to the 19th there was another hamlet called Newnham, northwest of the church. Later landowners included the Hungerford family (from the 14th century) and Sir Stephen Fox (1680s), who sold the manors in lots. The Great Western Railway opened their Salisbury branch line across the northeast of the parish in 1856, and station was nearby. That station closed in 1955 but the line and station remain open.  Religious sites  Parish church = St John's Church The parish church of St John the Evangelist was built in 1866-68 by J. L. Pearson, about 700 yards to the northwest of the ancient St Leonard's church, which had been damaged by subsidence. Pevsner writes that the newer church is \\"impressive, with its crossing tower and spire and its large five-light E and W windows\\"; he also notes the large rose window in the north transept and expresses delight at the stone rib-vaulting over the chancel and crossing, which he describes as Pearson's hallmark. The church, which is built in Frome stone, was paid for by members of the Everett family in memory of Joseph Everett (d. 1865), who had built Sutton Veny House. The six bells were transferred from St Leonard's church; three are from the late 17th century and two from the 18th. The church was recorded as Grade I listed in 1986. In the churchyard is a Portland stone war memorial in the shape of a cross, erected in 1920 with the names of 15 local servicemen who died during World War I; seven names were added after World War II. There is also an Australian War Graves cemetery, where 127 men of the Australian Military Forces were buried during the First World War, most dying in local hospitals of disease or from wounds. Among the graves is the burial place of Matron Jean Walker, the only Tasmanian nurse to die on active duty during that war; she succumbed to the flu pandemic in October 1918.\\"The Late Matron Walker\\" Sydney Morning Herald (11 January 1919): 17. via Trove = Former church = A church at Sutton Veny was first mentioned in 1220. St Leonard's church was built in the 13th century, incorporating a 12th-century doorway. After it was replaced by St John's church in 1868 the chancel was used for a time as a mortuary chapel, while the nave was partly dismantled and fell into ruin. It was declared redundant in 1970 and is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. = Notable rectors = Simon Sydenham, Dean of Salisbury and later Bishop of Chichester, was rector from 1417 to 1421. = Parish = The benefice was held in plurality with Norton Bavant from 1953. In 1976 the two parishes were united, together with the parish and benefice of Heytesbury with Tytherington and Knook. Today the parishes are among those served by the Upper Wylye Valley team. = Congregational chapel = A nonconformist chapel was built near Dymock's Lane in 1793, and a schoolroom added in 1818. Around 1800 there were three Sunday services, with 300 attending the evening service. Numbers dwindled in the 20th century and the chapel, which had been rebuilt in the later 19th century, was demolished in 1970. Notable buildings Polebridge, a rambling former farmhouse near St Leonard's church, has at its core the great hall of a 14th-century house. The building was altered in the 17th century and extended in 1902. Nearby is the Grade II* listed former rectory known as the Old Manor House. Originally a 14th-century hall house, it was altered in the late 17th century and wings were added in the 1850s. Greenhill House (now Sutton Veny House) was built in 1856 on the site of an earlier house, for Joseph Everett of Heytesbury. Standing in parkland and with formal gardens, the two-storey Regency-style ashlar house has a seven-window front, with a domed projection and Tuscan columns, and more columns form a verandah at the right side. Interior features such as the stairs, round-arched openings, panelling and fireplaces are in the style of the 17th and early 18th centuries. Lodges of similar date at the north and south entrances to the grounds have distyle in antis porticos. Renamed Sutton Veny House around the 1920s, since at the 1980s it has been used as a nursing home. Everett also built, in Tudor style, Greenhill Farm and a range of farm buildings and estate houses next to it along the Norton Bavant road.  Military sites  Large areas of Salisbury Plain began to be used for army training from the late 19th century. Troops and equipment travelled by train, and being near Warminster and Heytesbury stations, Sutton Veny parish was the site of some of the many encampments. = First World War = The 60th (2/2nd London) Division of the Territorial Force, established in August 1914, had its headquarters at Sutton Veny until it was sent to France in June and July 1916; 88 trains conveyed the division to Southampton from camps around Warminster, Heytesbury, and Codford stations. A hutted army hospital opened in the parish in 1916, with beds for 11 officers and 1,261 soldiers. After the armistice in November 1918, the 1st Australian General Hospital was transferred from France to Sutton Veny. Greenhill House was used by the YMCA as a headquarters and recreation centre. A railway line was built by the War Department from to the military camp; it was closed soon after the end of the war. An internment camp for German prisoners of war was at Cooper's Bottom, north of Greenhill House, from 1916. A record made in February 1918 lists 131 civilian internees at Sutton Veny, engaged in work for the Royal Engineers. = Second World War = From 1943, Sutton Veny House was an army headquarters, and units of the United States Army were barracked in the area in preparation for the invasion of Normandy in June 1944. A camp with brick huts was built to the west of the village, on both sides of the Longbridge Deverill road, just over the parish boundary. A 1958 map shows unlabelled groupings of small buildings. On modern maps the north side has reverted to farmland, but on the south most of the internal roads and some of the small buildings remain, and the area is a light industrial estate. = Today = Waterloo Lines at Warminster, about northwest of Sutton Verney, is an army headquarters and training site. Governance The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. The village is represented in parliament by Andrew Murrison and in Wiltshire Council by Fleur de Rh√©-Philipe, both Conservatives. Amenities Sutton Veny and the small settlements around it are served by Sutton Veny C of E Primary School.Sutton Veny Church of England Primary School The school was built in 1872, to a design by J. L. Pearson, and catered for all ages until 1931, when children over eleven were transferred to Warminster. The village hall is next to the school. The village has a pub, the Woolpack. The home ground of the Heytesbury and Sutton Veny Cricket Club is in Sutton Veny.

The canal is one of the oldest navigable canals in Belgium and indeed in Europe. History Construction work began in 1550 and lasted until 1561. However, permission to build the canal had already been granted by Philip the Good in 1436. But due to protests from the city of Mechelen (which levied taxes on all transport going through the traditional route via the Zenne river) the project was stalled for a very long time. In 1531 the Emperor, Charles V renewed the authorization of Philip the Good, but work did not begin immediately. It was not until 1550 that Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands) made an agreement to begin construction. On 16 June 1550 the mayor of Brussels, Jean de Locquenghien gave the ground-breaking ceremony. The difference in altitude of 14 m between Brussels and the Rupel river at Willebroek was achieved with 4 locks. With the commissioning of the canal, the ships could now avoid navigating the Zenne and being subject to tax in Mechelen. Soon several basins were built the heart of the city of Brussels, in the St. Catherine area. They were all filled in during the late nineteenth century but are still recognisable today in some of the street names. The course of the canal in Brussels was amended to connect to the Brussels-Charleroi Canal which opened in 1832, thus creating a direct link between the Port of Antwerp and the industrial area of Charleroi. During the 1920 Summer Olympics, the canal hosted the rowing events. In 1922 a fully modernised canal was opened to navigation. Now the canal in the Rupel led by a new lock at Wintham. The locks at Vilvoorde and Humbeek were replaced by the Kapelle-op-den-Bos lock. A new upgrade was initiated in 1965, the canal being widened to 55 m (25 m for the locks) and the draught adapted. The construction of two new locks (205 x 25 m) at Zemst (opened in 1975) and Hingene (opened in 1997) allowed the canal to lead directly into the Scheldt. The Port of Brussels is now accessible to ships of 4500 tons and pushed convoys of 9000 tons. The canal is of paramount importance for the supply of oil to Brussels, which typically represents 30 - 50% of annual traffic. In 1974 the annual traffic rose to 14 million tonnes. After a relapse, the volume transported has been rising again in recent years. With 7 million tons carried by the canal, the Port of Brussels is the second inland port in the country after the Port of Li√®ge. Following the regionalisation of Belgium, the management of the canal is no longer in the hands of the \\"SA Maritime\\" (a company established in 1896) but came under the control of the Port of Brussels for the part in the territory of the Brussels- Capital Region and Waterwegen en Zeekanaal NV for the part in the Flemish Region. In popular culture Wannes Van de Velde recorded a song about the bridge of Willebroek named De Brug van Willebroek.

It opened in 1880 then closed in 1933. History It was initially planned in 1870 and opened in 1880 with a large part of the funding provided by A. G. Campbell, a wealthy Utah mine owner and former Jackson County, Kansas resident, for whom it was named. It initially operated under the name of Campbell Normal University. Campbell was approached for money to start a college. Campbell offered to match up to $20,000 and $10,000 was raised locally. Eleven acres of land was purchased and a stone building was erected in 1880. In 1902 the United Brethren purchased Campbell and merged it with Lane University and the combined institution became Campbell University. It received another $100,000 donation from Mr. Campbell at this point. It then received pledges of financial support from the United Brethren churches in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri. By 1910 there were 500 students. Thomas D. Crites was the president of the college. In 1913 there were merger talks between the United Brethren and Methodist Protestants, trustees of Campbell agreed to merge with Kansas City University in Kansas City, Kansas. The school fielded a college football team for 14 seasons from 1898 to 1915. Kansas City University failed in 1933 due to financial difficulties.

Like an autogyro or helicopter, it relies on lift created by one or more sets of rotors in order to fly. Unlike a helicopter, gyrokites and rotor kites do not have an engine powering their rotors, but while an autogyro has an engine providing forward thrust that keeps the rotor turning, a rotor kite has no engine at all, and relies on either being carried aloft and dropped from another aircraft, or by being towed into the air behind a car or boat or by use of ambient winds for the kiting. As of 2009, no country in the world requires a license to pilot such a craft.  History  * Thomas Ansboro of Glasgow, Scotland taught an autorotating-winged rotor kite in 1891.Patent US464412 * Walter Van Wie filed a patent for a Revolving Kite in 1909 claiming \\"certain new and useful Improvements\\" in revolving kites\\" US966143 * 1933: Filed: July 11, 1933. US2074327 by De Courcy and Schwarz for Kite. * 1936: Filed: Aug 1, 1936. US2181477 by Carl B. Chupp for Aerial Device. Research into rotor kites or gyrokites was deepened during World War II, and one type in particular, the Focke Achgelis Fa 330, reached active service, being towed behind German U-boats as an aerial observation platform. In the United Kingdom, Raoul Hafner designed the Rotachute as a means of deploying paratroops, and a larger version, the Rotabuggy, was trialled as a means of air-dropping a jeep, but neither of these aircraft progressed past the experimental stage. Plans to similarly equip a tank never left the drawing board. During the 1950s, rotor kites were developed as recreational aircraft, largely due to the efforts of Dr. Igor Bensen in the United States, whose Bensen Aircraft Corporation produced a series of such aircraft, dubbed \\"gyrogliders\\" by Bensen. These were marketed as plans or kits for building at home, beginning with the B-5 and culminating with the B-8 by the end of the decade. The Bensen designs became so ubiquitous that the term \\"gyroglider\\" is sometimes used to refer to any rotor kite, regardless of manufacturer. In the 1960s, a B-8 gyroglider was evaluated by the United States Air Force as a \\"Discretionary Descent Vehicle\\", to provide a more controllable alternative than a parachute for a pilot ejecting from a stricken aircraft.

In 1999 they released their second album A vs. Monkey Kong. With its release they began touring internationally for the first time. The single \\"I Love Lake Tahoe\\" was a big hit in Germany, and in 2000 the band embarked on a worldwide tour with The Bloodhound Gang. The third album was Hi-Fi Serious, recorded in Germany with producer Al Clay in 2001. The first single from that album was \\"Nothing\\". The track reached the UK top 10. This was followed by top 20 hit \\"Starbucks\\". The band spent 2002 touring worldwide, appearing at many of the world's major festivals, and won a Kerrang award for best British band. In 2003 'A' released a brand new single \\"Good Time\\". Album four was recorded in early 2004 in Seattle, with producer Terry Date. Around the time the album was completed, the band's UK label, London Records, was bought out by Warner Music, which unfortunately meant the album was shelved for the rest of the year. 'A' made a brief return in August of that year, appearing at the Reading and Leeds festivals headlining the Concrete Jungle stage. The album Teen Dance Ordinance was finally released on 18 July 2005. The album's first single \\"Rush Song\\" was released in May. The single entered the charts at number 35, giving them a fourth top 40 hit. After 6 months of touring, including dates with Avril Lavigne in Germany, a main stage appearance at the Download Festival, it was announced that the band was being dropped by their label, Warner Music, due to poor record sales. The band then went into hiatus, stating that they were unable to continue financially. The return of 'A' 'A' returned in 2007 to play a one off festival in Rochford, but when a tour with The Wildhearts was announced in 2008, Carter declined to rejoin, posting the following on the band's forum. \\"'A' was some of the greatest times I have ever had playing music and I love those boys. I don't think I am 'too good' to be playing in 'A' and its not because I am too busy with my job at Radio 1. Its simply that when we drew a line in the sand and said we were done, I felt like we were. We played the one off show a while back and though it was fucking great whilst we were playing, as soon as it was finished I felt a bit confused as to what had just happened. So, to cease any speculation and so no one thinks there is any weirdness, I won't be playing the shows because I am trying to sort out my new band and focus on that for a little bit... If there are going to be more 'A' shows in the future, I may play them, I may not, depends if they still want me after John has shown his bass skills, but whatever happens I will be at the London show watching my brothers play some rocking tunes and I will sing along. The end.\\" Carter was replaced by John Mitchell, producer of Enter Shikari and Hexes as well as vocalist of It Bites. It was announced via the bands on 26 May 2010 that Carter would be touring with 'A' on their October tour of the UK and Ireland supporting Bowling For Soup Collective In 2005 Carter teamed up with old friend and established songwriter Julian Emery and fellow 'A' member Jason Perry, and formed \\"Collective\\", a songwriting and production team. Collective is managed by Jason Perry's brother Adam. Their first project was co-writing and producing the debut album from Matt Willis, Don't Let It Go to Waste. Carter co-wrote \\"Luxury\\", \\"Who You Gonna Run To\\", \\"Get Bored\\", \\"Not Over\\" and \\"Whats the Point\\". The album reached gold status and included three top 40 UK singles. The team's next project was McFly's third album, Motion in the Ocean. The album reached the top 10 and produced three number-one singles in the UK. Carter co-wrote \\"Star Girl\\", which was a number-one single, and \\"Friday Night\\", which also appeared on soundtrack of the 2006 film Night at the Museum. The team have also been involved with a string of writing sessions with the likes of Sugababes and Andrea Corr. Other work Over 2005 and 2006 Dan briefly became a member of Matt Willis live band after playing bass and guitar on the album Don't Let It Go to Waste.

Such proofs can be considered more elegant than formal or mathematically rigorous due to their self-evident nature. When the diagram demonstrates a particular case of a general statement, to be a proof, it must be generalisable. Retrieved on 2008-6-20 ExamplesSum of odd numbers= A proof without words for the sum of odd numbers theorem. The statement that the sum of all positive odd numbers up to 2n ‚àí 1 is a perfect square--more specifically, the perfect square n2--can be demonstrated by a proof without words, as shown on the right. The first square is formed by 1 block; 1 is the first square. The next strip, made of white squares, shows how adding 3 more blocks makes another square: four. The next strip, made of black squares, shows how adding 5 more blocks makes the next square. This process can be continued indefinitely. =Pythagorean theorem= A proof without words for the Pythagorean theorem derived in Zhoubi Suanjing. The Pythagorean theorem can be proven without words as shown in the second diagram on left. The two different methods for determining the area of the large square give the relation : a^2 + b^2 = c^2 between the sides. This proof is more subtle than the above, but still can be considered a proof without words. =Jensen's inequality= A graphical proof of Jensen's inequality. Jensen's inequality can also be proven graphically, as illustrated on the third diagram. The dashed curve along the X axis is the hypothetical distribution of X, while the dashed curve along the Y axis is the corresponding distribution of Y values. Note that the convex mapping Y(X) increasingly \\"stretches\\" the distribution for increasing values of X.

He lived in Massachusetts for a few years where two of his children were born. In 1873, he and his brother Gilbert moved to the border town of St. Stephen on the St. Croix River across from Calais, Maine. There, they established a grocery business and within a few years added a bakery and confectionery manufactory plus expanded their retailing to include a store in Calais. Successful, in 1878 the brothers, in partnership with Freeman H. Todd, built the St. Croix Soap Manufacturing Company but in 1884 they elected to dissolve their partnership. Gilbert Ganong retained the store, bakery and confectionery business while James took over the soap factory. The soap-making business continued to do very well and became widely known for its Surprise Soap brand that eventually was distributed nationally. James Ganong was actively involved in community affairs and served as mayor of St. Stephen. He died unexpectedly in 1888 at the age of forty-seven upon which his son, Edwin, took over the running of the soap business.

The concept of globality was introduced in the social sciences by British sociologist Roland Robertson. It signifies the spreading and deepening consciousness of the world-as-a-whole and could thus be considered the phenomenological aspect of globalization, which Robertson defined as \\"the compression of the world and the intensification of consciousness of the world as a whole\\" (Robertson 1992, p. 34). Earlier definitions of globality referred to the quality of being global or universal. With Robertson, globality acquires a specific scientific definition.  Globality in business studies  Pundits like Daniel Yergin now employ the concept of globality to speculate about the end-state of globalization, a hypothetical condition in which the process of globalization is complete or nearly so, barriers have fallen, and \\"a new global reality\\" is emerging. The current use of ‚Äúglobality‚Äù in business studies ‚Äì as a description of the current competitive state of world commerce ‚Äì was not adopted until recently. The book: Globality: Competing with Everyone from Everywhere for Everything, Hal Sirkin Jim Hemerling Arindam Bhattacharya June 11, 2008, elaborates on how 'challenger' businesses from rapidly developing economies abroad are aggressively and inventively overtaking existing 'incumbent' nations. According to Sirkin et al. (2008), globality has three main features as it applies to commerce and business: # A significant structural shift in the flow of commerce: companies from every part of the world are now competing with each other for ‚Äúeverything‚Äù ‚Äì customers, suppliers, partners, capital, intellectual property, raw materials, distribution systems, manufacturing capabilities, and most important, talent. In this competitive free-for-all, products and services flow from many locations to many destinations. # A breakdown in the established hierarchy of commercial power and influence: power is shifting away from traditional centers of influence in developed markets in the United States, Europe, and Japan, as companies from rapidly developing economies (RDEs) are quickly assuming leadership positions in global markets, forcing established leaders to compete on new terms. # The emergence of new business and governance practices better suited to a truly global and decentralized business environment. To compete successfully in a world of globality, established industry leaders from developed markets are being forced to learn from competitors in developing markets. The practices include shifting autonomy and decision making outward to satellite operations; redeploying assets to build commerce within emerging regions; and expanding quickly into new markets to match the speed and scale with which challengers are rising.

Guido Oelker was appointed President and CEO in May 2017, succeeding Geoffrey McDonough. Oelkers had previously been CEO of . In 2019 it had a revenue of SEK 14,248million and 1,335 employees.  History  Sobi has been involved in the process development and manufacturing of recombinant protein drugs since the technology was first developed around 30 years ago, then as part of KabiVitrum. Biovitrum was formed in 2001 through the merger of several units of Pharmacia (now Pfizer) and spun off to a consortium of investors led by Nordic Capital and MPM Capital Funds. Operations included a research unit focused on metabolic diseases, a process development unit for protein drugs and a plasma product operation. In 2002 Sobi sold its plasma operation to Octapharma as part of efforts to concentrate operations on protein-based and small molecular drugs. In 2004, Biovitrum started to manufacture the active protein component for Wyeth‚Äôs (now Pfizer‚Äôs) ReFacto¬Æ and ReFacto/Xynta¬Æ drugs for treatment of hemophilia, and marketing of specialty pharmaceuticals (ReFacto, Mimpara and Kineret¬Æ) was initiated in the Nordic region. In 2005, the research and development portfolio was expanded through the acquisition of Arexis, a Swedish biotech company, and the following year a partnership was formed with Syntonix (subsequently Biogen Idec) to jointly develop a drug for hemophilia B, a long-lasting recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein candidate, rFIXFc. This partnership was extended the following year to also include the development of a long-lasting recombinant factor VIII Fc fusion protein candidate, rFVIIIFc, for the treatment of hemophilia A. In 2008, an agreement with Amgen regarding the acquisition of the products Kepivance and Stemgen as well as a global license for Kineret was signed In 2009, Sobi and partner Biogen Idec took the decision to enter final registration studies for the recombinant factor FIXFc. The company also received positive data regarding its Kiobrina phase II program, an investigational enzyme replacement therapy to improve growth in preterm infants who receive pasteurized breast milk or infant formula. In 2010, Biovitrum acquired Swedish Orphan International Holding AB, a pioneer in orphan drugs, and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) was formed.Change of company name for Biovitrum AB, 2010-06-21 In addition, the decisions to advance both hemophilia projects as well as Kiobrina into phase III were taken. The following year the first patient was enrolled in the phase 3 study for Kiobrina and data from the rFVIIIFc hemophilia phase I/II study were presented showing an approximately 1.7-fold increase in half-life compared with Advate. The company also established a US subsidiary. In 2012 the supply agreement with Pfizer for ReFacto/Xyntha was extended until 2020 in addition to the agreement to return the co-promotion rights for the Nordic region for ReFacto to Pfizer for a payment of USD 47.4 M. The same year, the Sobi and partner Biogen Idec initiated global pediatric clinical trials of their long- lasting hemophilia A and B product candidates.  Company  Sobi is an international specialty healthcare company dedicated to rare diseases. The product portfolio is primarily focused on Inflammation and Genetic diseases, with three late stage biological development projects within Haemophilia and Neonatology. The company also market a portfolio of specialty and rare disease products for partner companies. Sobi is active in protein biochemistry and biologics manufacturing.

He is the author of five books of verse, two books of verse translation and one book of literary criticism. He was a co-founder of the literary magazine, Canto: Review of the Arts, which flourished in the 1970s, and as a literary editor he launched the poetry chapbook series at the Godine Press. He is a recipient of the Carey Thomas Award for creative publishing. Born in Wisconsin, Schreiber attended Stanford University, where he received his BA, then earned an MA at the University of Toronto and a PhD at Brandeis University where he studied with the poet J.V. Cunningham. Although he taught for brief periods at Tufts University and Lowell Technological Institute (now the University of Massachusetts Lowell), he spent most of his life as a researcher in the social sciences (founding the Social Science Research Institute) and a software entrepreneur (founding MicroSolve Corporation). As a poet, Schreiber has written mainly in traditional forms. Though most of his verse consists of short lyric poems, he is also known for sharp, satirical epigrams of the kind commonly associated with Cunningham, and he has produced a few longer works extending to some 150 lines. Beginning in 2004 Schreiber began writing for the on-line journal Contemporary Poetry Review, for which he produced numerous critical articles, some on individual poets, some on influential critics and scholars, and some on the development of the poetic canon. Many of these essays later appeared in his book Sparring with the Sun. Examples of his work as a poet appear in the on-line anthologies The Hypertexts and Poem Tree and in Lay Bare the Canvas, an anthology of poems about works of art. Seven of his poems were set to music by Paul Alan Levi in a song cycle for tenor and piano called Zeno's Arrow, which has been performed in Massachusetts and New York. Since 2010 Schreiber has been closely involved in the Symposium on Poetry Criticism, which he co-founded, held annually at Western State Colorado University as part of its Writing the Rockies literary conference. In 2015 he was named Poet Laureate for the town of Brookline, Massachusetts. He serves as advisory editor for Think, a magazine of poetry, fiction, and essays.

The New York Times has said that the \\"opposing curves, (form) a gateway as impressive as any publicly built arch or plaza in New York.\\" The unusual curved facades are the result of an 1897 plan to make the land between Claremont Avenue and Riverside Drive into a public park in order to give veterans' parades a large park adjacent to Grant's Tomb as a terminus. The street was redesigned to enter the proposed park in a gracious curve, but the city never appropriated funds to buy the land. The Colosseum was designed by Schwartz & Gross and built by the Paterno Brothers, Charles and Joseph, in 1909-1910. The luxury four-bedroom apartments with sweeping views of the Hudson River rented for $150 to $175 a month. Harlan Fiske Stone and Lajos \\"Louis\\" Jambor lived in the Colosseum when it was a private building. The Colosseum was later acquired by Columbia University. Among the distinguished members of the Columbia faculty who have lived here are David Weiss Halivni and Edward Said.

Early life and career Michael Alexander Stern was born on 13 January 1922 in Egypt, the son of a civil engineer. He attended Ravenswood Preparatory School in Devon and Gresham's School in Holt, Norfolk. Stern went to Downing College, Cambridge for a year before his studies were interrupted by World War II. Stern served in the Royal Signals in the British Army in North Africa, Italy, and Greece, rising to the rank of captain. He graduated from Downing College in 1947. Stern taught at school in England, later assuming head teaching posts at approved schools from 1952 to 1955. In 1955, Stern read an article by the Revd Trevor Huddleston and, at Huddleston's invitation, Stern went to South Africa and became the headmaster of St Peter's, a school for African children in Johannesburg. However, educational policies under the apartheid government in South Africa forced the school to close. Stern was then appointed as the headmaster of the new (white) school which took its place, St. Martin's School, Rosettenville, by the bishop of Johannesburg, Ambrose Reeves. He stayed for five years. Waterford School Stern left South Africa for Swaziland to establish a new school in which students of all races could study together, with an emphasis on cooperation in community service. As a result of his efforts, Waterford School was born in 1963. Stern and his school became famous across southern Africa. Nelson Mandela, still in prison, sent his daughters there. Desmond Tutu sent his children. Seretse Khama, the leader of Botswana, sent his son Ian, who would later become President of Botswana. The Tutu and Sisulu families also sent their children. Another Waterford boy, Fernando Honwana, became a trusted assistant to Samora Machel of Mozambique, helping him to act as go-between in negotiations between Margaret Thatcher's administration and the emerging African government in Rhodesia, later Zimbabwe. Stern's educational accomplishment was based on the school's balance of boys (and later girls) of all races, tribes and religions. In November 1995, Nelson Mandela presented Stern with a Founder‚Äôs Medal, saying in his speech that Stern's time at Waterford \\"demonstrated in the worst days of apartheid, that even those who were free to enjoy the privileges of the system could ally themselves with the oppressed in the interest of non-racialism in Southern Africa.\\" Stern was appointed OBE in 1968, and in 1999 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Sussex University. Later life Stern returned to England in 1973 and served as superintendent for children's homes until 1980. He then served as director of the charity Mind from 1980 to 1983. In 1986, Stern married Sarah Roberts, who had a son, Hugh, by a previous marriage. They had a daughter, Miranda. Sarah died in 1987, and Michael Stern focused on raising the children himself. Michael Stern died in a car accident in Hindhead, Surrey on 14 July 2002, aged 80.

Life John was a son of John de Graham and Marjory Halliday. He accompanied David II in his invasion of England in 1346. He was present at the battle of Neville's Cross and, when the archers were almost within bowshot, earnestly urged the King to send a body of cavalry to charge them in flank. His advice was unhappily disregarded and when the archers were about to direct their deadly volleys on the serried ranks of the Scottish spearmen, the Earl exclaimed, 'Give me but a hundred horse and I engage to disperse them all; so shall we be able to fight more securely.' His appeal was, however, unheeded and hastily leaping upon his horse, and followed only by his own retainers, he rushed upon the advancing bowmen but his gallant attack was not supported. His horse was killed under him and after bravely, but vainly, striving to arrest the advance of the enemy, he was compelled to retire to the main body of the Scottish army. After a stout battle, which lasted for three hours, the Earl was taken prisoner, along with his sovereign, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London.

Its residents are predominantly M√©tis people. Green Lake is located northeast of Meadow Lake, and northwest of Big River. It lies in the southern boreal forest, and takes its name from nearby Green Lake. Fishing, tourism, and farming, are the major industries.  History  The Northern Village of Green Lake dates back to 1782, when the North West Company (NWC) established a wintering post on Green Lake. In 1793 the NWC established a permanent post, and in 1810 the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) established itself on the lake. In 1816-1817, the NWC seized the HBC post and its men, however a HBC post was re-established by 1818, and in 1821 the two companies merged. Shortly after the merger, the Green Lake post was closed for several years, reopening in 1831, and continuing operation until 1973. The Green Lake post was an important post in north-central Saskatchewan, connecting many overland trails with the Churchill River. By the mid 19th century, missionaries had established the Roman Catholic Church in Green Lake. In 1876 Treaty 6, was signed, and soon after settlers began moving into the area. Natives were allowed to join Treaty 6, or had the option of taking scrip. During the North-West Rebellion the HBC store in Green Lake was ransacked by Cree from Frog Lake. In 1900, a telegraph service and post office were established, and a trail to Meadow Lake was opened. In 1901 a new church was built by the community. By 1939, the local M√©tis were subjected to a Government program called the Green Lake Metis Rehabilitation Program. A Government project created and designed to assimilate the people of Green Lake into mainstream society, southern Metis from the Regina area were introduced to the northern community as part of the rehabilitation program. The new arrivals were unable to adapt to the lifestyle and after a year began relocating en masse to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan or Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan. The provincial government set up Central Farm, a program of 99-year leases on plots. In addition, a new road was built to Meadow Lake and √éle-√†-la-Crosse. In 1940, an outpost hospital was built by the government and run by Sisters of the Presentation of Mary. The Sisters also oversaw the running of a cannery, carpentry, and sewing shops. By 1945 a Timber Board and Local Improvement District (LID) were established. A saw mill was opened under the Timber Board, which employed up to 100 men. Under the LID, the Central Farm was expanded, and the Silver Lake Farm was formed in 1965, consisting of mixed farming with an emphasis on cattle. In 1947, Saskatchewan Highway 155 was established, replacing the existing bush trail, the \\"Old Bay Trail\\", connecting Green Lake to Beauval. The highway was completed in 1957, extending to the south side of the Buffalo Narrows Channel. A year-round ferry was set up at Buffalo Narrows. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment and a Red Cross Nursing Station were established in 1953. In 1972, the LID was replaced by the Department of Northern Saskatchewan (DNS) with a Local Community Authority (LCA). Green Lake, and the area within a three-mile (4.8 km) radius from the centre of the community, became Northern Community Area 17. The first LCA members were elected in 1974. In 1974 a new sawmill was built, and in 1975-76 Saskatchewan Highway 55 to Meadow Lake was completed, and a DNS funded sewer and water system is installed. In 1983, Green Lake was incorporated as a northern village. In 1992, the community-owned sawmill, Green Lake Metis Wood Products Limited, was incorporated. The mill signed agreements with Weyerhaeuser, Norsask Forest Products, Mistik Management and Province of Saskatchewan, before burning down in 2000. The mill was rebuilt in 2002, only to close in 2003. In 1996, the Provincial Government gave Central Farm to the Northern Village of Green Lake, and in 2006 it obtained ownership of the Silver Lake Farm as well. In 1998, Green Lake Metis Farms Limited was incorporated, and the community operated the two farms with the aid of the board. Both farms are operated as community pasture. Central farm is , and Silver Lake is . = Green Lake House and Essex House = In 1782,Arthur Morton, \\"A History of the Canadian West\\", page 451; there seems to be some doubt about the date the North West Company established Green Lake House on the southwest shore of the lake. As of 1790 it was only occupied in winter and was an outpost of Lac √éle-√†-la-Crosse. When William McGillivray at Lac √éle-√†- la-Crosse was in charge of the Churchill River department he arranged for pemmican to be shipped north from the Saskatchewan to the northern posts. In 1795 the men at Green Lake House were near starvation when a pemmican supply arrived from Fort George. In 1798 David Thompson (explorer) passed through. He sent his canoes on up the Beaver River toward Lac La Biche while he went on horseback to Fort George on the Saskatchewan before returning to his canoes. In 1799 the Hudson's Bay Company sent William Auld to build Essex House on the northwest shore of the lake near its outlet. The NWC moved its post up the lake directly across from its rival. By the next winter the NWC had 30 men and the HBC 11. The whole √éle √† la Crosse region produced 12,000 made beaver for the NWC and 1,800 for the HBC. In 1806 the Nor'Westers burnt down the HBC post. In 1810 Robert Sutherland rebuilt the post. Samuel Black of the NWC only had to send one man to threaten the Indians away. The Nor'Westers burned the post in 1811. In 1815, it was rebuilt. From 1814, Peter Skene Ogden was in charge of the NWC post. He executed or murdered an Indian for the crime of trading with the HBC. When the HBC got a Montreal warrant for him in 1818 the NWC transferred him to the Oregon country where he became very important. Around 1817, Ogden and Samuel Black plundered the post and arrested its officers. It was back in operation in 1818. In 1820, Sir John Franklin visited Essex House. In 1821 the two companies merged and HBC operations were moved to Green Lake House which used that name under the HBC. It became increasingly important for supplies moving north from the Saskatchewan. In 1875‚Äì76 an ox- cart road was cut north from Fort Carlton. The HBC closed its store in 1973. = Looting of Green Lake House = At the time of the North-West Rebellion in 1885 the Hudson's Bay Company post in Green Lake was waiting for the ice to break on the northern lakes and rivers so that the stockpile of goods in their warehouses could be safely sent up the Beaver River to posts further north including the Athabasca and Mackenzie River Districts. Within these warehouses were a years supply of goods for these northern posts. On April 25, 1885, James Sinclair the factor of the post having been forewarned by Father M√©lasyppe Paquette O.M.I. of approaching rebels immediately gave the order to submerge into the lake all the lead balls and shot. He loaded four York boats with 246 barrels of powder and 200 rifles along with a large quantity of stock and sent the boats that night towards √éle-√†-la-Crosse. The next morning on April 26 he loaded the rest of his men and their families along with the missionary and his companions on another boat. As they were ready to leave the shore 25 Cree from Loon Lake stopped them. Sinclair was taken prisoner but the others were let go to continue on their way. From Sinclair they demanded food saying they were starving but their demands did not stop there. They started breaking boxes, opening bales, slashing open bags of sugar and flour with their knives taking whatever pleased them and destroying the rest. While the post was being looted Sinclair managed to slip away from his guards and fled by canoe with two M√©tis men from Fort Carlton. Sinclair was able to rejoin the boats and while they camped on the side of the river his wife gave birth to a healthy girl who was baptised immediately by Father Paquette.

Gameplay Gameplay screeenshot The player controls a saucer-shaped ship using a joystick and the keyboard, and can fire weapons in eight directions, both at the terrain (to dig holes or tunnels) and at enemies. The player uses the joystick to apply thrust in different directions, meaning the ship can be moving in one direction and firing in any other (strafing the ground or enemies). The \`X\` key on the keyboard causes the ship to full-stop. Various kinds of enemies are found in the game, each of which reacts to the player differently. Some attack the player immediately, some wait until the player is within close proximity, some wait until the player is in their line of sight, etc. Some large enemies release smaller enemies that in turn attack the player.

She was called the \\"Mauresse de Moret\\" (\\"Mooress of Moret\\"), and a portrait of her exists in the Biblioth√®que Sainte Genevi√®ve in Paris. Research conducted by the Soci√©t√© de l'histoire de Paris et d'Ile-de-France, published in 1924 by Honor√© Champion √©ditions, concluded that this pastel portrait was painted around 1680 by the same hand which painted the series of 22 pastel portraits of Kings of France, from Louis IX to Louis XIV, between 1681 and 1683 on the initiative of Father Claude Du Molinet (1620‚Äì1687), librarian of Sainte Genevi√®ve abbey.

Shortly after the death of the French Queen Maria Theresa of Spain, wife of Louis XIV, in 1683, courtiers said that this woman could be the daughter, allegedly black, to whom the Queen gave birth in 1664.

(July 15, 2007) Contra Costa Times Harmony among the redwoods; 50 years later, Cazadero camp is still serving up summer musical magic. Section: Time Out; Page C3. Established in 1957 by then Berkeley High School band director Bob Lutt (who eventually was made executive director of the Berkeley Symphony), the first campers were a mixture of Berkeley High teens and members of the San Francisco Symphony.  History of the camp  Since 1957, the camp has had a significant influence in many facets of San Francisco Bay Area music, including the San Francisco Symphony, the orchestras for the San Francisco Opera and the San Francisco Ballet, and Tower of Power, an Oakland, California 10-member horn-based soul band formed in 1968. The first few years the camp consisted of musicians and their families. By 1963 they took over the entire summer for music education. In the mid- 70s Lutt and the city of Berkeley had a disagreement over the type of musicians who would attend the camp. The city of Berkeley thought the skill range of musicians who attend the camp should be more general so that students with different skill levels would all have the ability to attend. However, Lutt thought only more serious musicians should attend. In 1995 Bob‚Äôs son Bill Lutt, called former campers to see if they would be interested in resurrecting the camp. The following year music students returned to Cazadero.  Founder Bob Lutt  Long time music teacher Bob Lutt was the founder of Cazadero Performing Arts Camp. Born in Nebraska, he started his life-long passion for music by asking his parents for a $25 trombone when he was 12. In 1954 Lutt began teaching at Berkeley High School. His years of teaching experience compelled him to ask Berkeley city officials to let him use a plot of land near Russian River. Lutt retired after 35 years of public education but could not stay away from music for very long. Bob was committed to music education until his death in October 26, 2011.  Visiting conductors  Cazadero attracts a wide range of in demand music educators from the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond as music instruction is an essential aspect of everyday camp life. Every week Cazadero has a different conductor for orchestra, concert band, jazz band, and all camp choir. In the 2019 Junior High session, Aaron Smith was a guest conductor for concert band. During the school year, Smith works as a music teacher at Monterey Trail High School in Elk Grove, California. Also in the summer of 2019, Michael Boitz from Saratoga High School, Patrick Langham, Director of Jazz Studies at the University of Pacific and Susanna Peeples, worked as guest conductors for the junior high orchestra.  Music faculty/staff  Cazadero faculty have been innovative with their instructional methods as they were the first to conceive of a professional baroque chamber orchestra composed entirely of period instruments, resulting in the 1981 creation of the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra by harpsichordist Laurette Goldberg.Burrell, Jackie. (July 15, 2007) Contra Costa Times Harmony among the redwoods; 50 years later, Cazadero camp is still serving up summer musical magic. Section: Time Out; Page C3.  Programs for Musicians  Each summer, the camp hosts educational programs for young musicians, as well as the Cazadero Performing Arts Family Camp where children and adults take arts classes side-by-side. Campers also enjoy 'downtime activities' such as swimming, ping pong, basketball, lanyards, friendship bracelets and foosball. The camp, which sits atop the late 19th century location of the then-infamous Bohemian Grove, maintains a signature suspension bridge over which more than 100,000 young musicians have crossed.Burrell, Jackie.

Formation and structure It was formed in Warsaw district of Old Town on August 1, 1944, on the first day of the Uprising, as part of Company Rog of the Northern Group of the Home Army, under Colonel Karol Ziemski (nom de guerre Wachnowski). The 104 Company itself was commanded by Lieutenant Kazimierz Puczy≈Ñski (nom de guerre Wronski), and his deputy was Witold Potz (nom de guerre Koperski). It consisted of three assault platoons, a reserve platoon, and two labor platoons. The assault platoons were commanded by the following officers: * 1st platoon - commandant Ignacy Choynowski (Rogoza), who died August 3, 1944. After that, he was replaced by Karol Choynowski (Karol), who was severely wounded on August 11, 1944, and was replaced by an unknown officer (nom de guerre Nord), who died around August 20. Finally, last commandant of the platoon was Stanislaw Narczy≈Ñski (Ma≈Çy), * 2nd platoon - commandant Feliks Murawa (Smaga) (seriously sick after August 20, 1944), replaced by Mieczyslaw Teisseyre (Tesc), who was severely wounded on August 27, 1944. Platoon‚Äôs last commandant was Stanis≈Çaw Komornicki (Na≈Çƒôcz), * 3rd platoon - commandant Jozef Dolegowski (Le≈õniewski) (died August 28, 1944) and replaced by Wac≈Çaw Borowski (Ry≈õ). Also, it had a unit of Military Service of Women, commanded by Maria Oneker, who died on August 22, 1944, and was replaced by Zofia Garnysz-Strzemiƒôczna. Participation in the Warsaw UprisingFirst days= At first, the Company had around 50 soldiers, but it quickly grew in size, with numerous volunteers joining. On the first day of the Uprising, it took part in two failed attacks on a school located at Barokowa street, in which a German hospital was located. Also, it attacked the Polish Securities Printing House building, capturing it on the night of August 1/2. On the third day of the Uprising, it had some 360 soldiers, who, however, lacked weapons. The situation improved when the Poles captured Krasi≈Ñski Palace and seized German guns and grenades as well as 42 German POWs. The Company was not only engaged in fighting. It had its own field bakery, which made bread, distributed to civilian population, as well as a field hospital, led by doctor Adam Krakowski. Furthermore, it had its own press service, consisting of members of the Union of Polish Syndicalists. It published two magazines - Iskra and Syndykalista. After heavy fights in the first weeks of August 1944, the Company became the best-equipped Polish unit in the area of the Old Town. It participated in capture of the PASTA skyscraper and in skirmishes around Warsaw‚Äôs Royal Castle. Then, under pressure from the Germans, it organized defence of the Old Town, including St. John‚Äôs Cathedral. In the second half of August, the Company created its headquarters in the so-called Professors‚Äô House, at 12 Brzozowa Street, where it stayed until general retreat from the district. During several skirmishes back then, the Company used red-black flags of Anarcho-syndicalists, which was at odds with the Home Army‚Äôs Military police, which demanded replacement of the flag with the Polish one and change the name of the Company into 104 Company of the Home Army. It has been estimated that losses (KIA, MIA and WIA) of the unit reached more than 50% of its personnel. =Final days= In late August 1944 the company, numbering only around 100 soldiers, evacuated through the sewage canals to the Warszawa-≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie (Warsas city center). There, it became part of the Boncza Battalion, and took part in fighting in the district of Powi≈õle, during which the Company was further depleted. The Assault Platoon, with 26 men managed to get to Czerniak√≥w, where it became engaged in heavy fighting. In early September, parts of the company carried out rearguard actions during the evacuation of Warsaw‚Äôs Old Town. On September 15, 1944, three soldiers of the company managed to get across to the eastern bank of the Vistula. Later on more men got across, where they were conscripted into the First Polish Army.

It is located in Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas. Deriving its name from the actual location of the basement space \\"under Main Street\\", this ensemble group of theatre artists performs new and experimental works throughout Dallas, New York City and Europe and has become known for producing many contemporary writers. Undermain Theatre history In fall 1983, Katherine Owens and Raphael Parry arrived in Dallas. Both were interested in presenting new and experimental material with an ensemble company in the Deep Ellum area. They began producing together at Stage Number One's Greenville Avenue Theater, in association with Dallas Actor's Theater, on a triple bill of Action, Killer‚Äôs Head and Icarus's Mother by Sam Shepard. In early 1984, they found the vacant basement space of the now historical Interstate Forwarding Company building on 3200 Main Street. By spring 1984, they had their first production, Excavations: Killer‚Äôs Head, Twirler, Waking Up, in the Main Street space. Excavations was part of a Gallery Walk event and was presented in a promenade style due to the lack of seating in their basement theater space. The show was a series of one-acts that both Owens and Parry directed and performed in. By the end of their first season, they were on their way to building their ensemble. In April 1985, Bruce DuBose joined the cast of Dario Fo‚Äôs Can't Pay? Won't Pay!, beginning a longtime relationship that eventually took DuBose to the position of executive producer of Undermain Theatre. With each season, Undermain continued to thrive and grow. By its third season, Dallas critics began to take notice and by the end of the fourth season, in spring 1987, Undermain flew in the playwright John O‚ÄôKeefe to develop his play, All Night Long. In September that year, Undermain developed a relationship with Jeff Jones while producing Seventy Scenes of Halloween. This friendship proved to be advantageous, leading to Undermain's long standing relationships with the playwrights Len Jenkin, Mac Wellman and Eric Ehn and the subsequent productions of Poor Folks Pleasure, Harm‚Äôs Way, A Murder of Crows and The Red Plays, among other shows, establishing Undermain Theatre's name among the language playwrights in New York City and around the US.

Travel In 1995, Undermain Theatre traveled to the Republic of Macedonia to perform Goran Stefanvovski's Sarajevo in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. Undermain also performed at the ancient Roman Theatre at Bittola and at the Ohrid Theater Festival. In 2000, the theater company traveled to New York City for the first time, producing three shows there (Coaticook by Lenora Champagne, Gold Into Mud and Swedish Tales of Woe by Erik Ehn) as well as four shows in Dallas. In 2001, the company returned to the Balkans with a new work and performed at the DAH Teatar Anniversary Celebration in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The building The unique building, constructed in 1913 by B.D. Milam and E.C. Connor as the first US Customs warehouse in Dallas, is a six-story, Chicago-style building billed as absolutely fireproof with an exterior that was made with red and ironspot bricks and concrete. Jim and Michelle Herling, the owners of the building in the early 1980s, were patrons of the arts, already housing an art gallery on the first floor of the building, and were willing to allow Owens and Parry to rent the entire basement floor at a very low price. From that, Owens and Parry transformed the warehouse basement into a unique performance space that became the home of Undermain Theatre. In 1989, Undermain Properties bought the building on 3200 Main Street. It was adapted for residential use in 1991 by Graham Greene & RTHL to include 28 residential units, keeping both the theatre and the art galleries in their respective places. The building became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1991 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. It is also a City of Dallas Landmark. The chairs The 90-seat house at Undermain Theatre is also unique. The chairs, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, were originally housed in the Kalita Humphreys Theater. Obtained by the Undermain from the Dallas Theater Center in 1989, the seating was designed by Taliesin architects, the firm that completed many of Wright's projects after his death in 1959. Its design was based on a variety of ideas promoted by Wright himself and by Paul Baker (Director of the Dallas Theater Center in 1957).

Compound terms are built by combining two or more simple terms; for example, \\"triple\\" is a single word term, but \\"triple heart bypass\\" is a compound term. Compound-term processing is a new approach to an old problem: how can one improve the relevance of search results while maintaining ease of use? Using this technique, a search for survival rates following a triple heart bypass in elderly people will locate documents about this topic even if this precise phrase is not contained in any document. This can be performed by a concept search, which itself uses compound-term processing. This will extract the key concepts automatically (in this case \\"survival rates\\", \\"triple heart bypass\\" and \\"elderly people\\") and use these concepts to select the most relevant documents.  Techniques  In August 2003, Concept Searching Limited introduced the idea of using statistical compound-term processing. The British Library Direct catalogue entry can be found here: CLAMOUR is a European collaborative project which aims to find a better way to classify when collecting and disseminating industrial information and statistics. CLAMOUR appears to use a linguistic approach, rather than one based on statistical modelling. National Statistics CLAMOUR project  History  Techniques for probabilistic weighting of single word terms date back to at least 1976 in the landmark publication by Stephen E. Robertson and Karen Sp√§rck Jones. Robertson stated that the assumption of word independence is not justified and exists as a matter of mathematical convenience. His objection to the term independence is not a new idea, dating back to at least 1964 when H. H. Williams stated that \\"[t]he assumption of independence of words in a document is usually made as a matter of mathematical convenience\\". In 2004, Anna Lynn Patterson filed patents on \\"phrase-based searching in an information retrieval system\\" to which Google subsequently acquired the rights.Google Acquires Cuil Patent Applications  Adaptability  Statistical compound-term processing is more adaptable than the process described by Patterson. Her process is targeted at searching the World Wide Web where an extensive statistical knowledge of common searches can be used to identify candidate phrases. Statistical compound term processing is more suited to enterprise search applications where such a priori knowledge is not available. Statistical compound-term processing is also more adaptable than the linguistic approach taken by the CLAMOUR project, which must consider the syntactic properties of the terms (i.e. part of speech, gender, number, etc.) and their combinations. CLAMOUR is highly language-dependent, whereas the statistical approach is language-independent.  Applications  Compound- term processing allows information-retrieval applications, such as search engines, to perform their matching on the basis of multi-word concepts, rather than on single words in isolation which can be highly ambiguous. Early search engines looked for documents containing the words entered by the user into the search box . These are known as keyword search engines. Boolean search engines add a degree of sophistication by allowing the user to specify additional requirements. For example, \\"Tiger NEAR Woods AND (golf OR golfing) NOT Volkswagen\\" uses the operators \\"NEAR\\", \\"AND\\", \\"OR\\" and \\"NOT\\" to specify that these words must follow certain requirements. A phrase search is simpler to use, but requires that the exact phrase specified appear in the results.

The film was directed by Martin Ritt, starring James Earl Jones, Jane Alexander, Chester Morris, Hal Holbrook, Beah Richards and Moses Gunn. Jones and Alexander, who also appeared in the same roles in the stage versions, received Best Actor and Actress Academy Award nominations for their performances. The film and play is based on the true story of Jack Johnson and his first wife, Etta Terry Duryea, and the controversy over their marriage and Duryea's death by suicide in 1912.Unforgivable Blackness accessed 11/5/2016 Plot Set between 1910 and 1915, the story follows Jack Jefferson, patterned after real- life boxer Jack Johnson, going on a hot streak of victories in the boxing ring as he defeats every white boxer around. Soon the press and racists announce the search for a \\"great white hope\\", a (white) boxer who will defeat Jefferson for the heavyweight title. Meanwhile, Jefferson prepares for a few more matches, but he lets his guard down by courting the beautiful, and very white, Eleanor Bachman, and when everyone, including Jack's black \\"wife\\", discover this, the tensions grow to fever pitch. Jack's close black friends become scared over his pushing the envelope of success and the white authorities conspire to frame him with unlawful sexual relations with Eleanor and thereby take away his title. It leads to jealousy, a run from the law, and finally, disaster.

On Metacritic the film has a score of 53% based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". =Box Office= According to Fox records, the film required $16,075,000 in rentals to break even.

But some old people of the area say that before the irrigation system, this place was barren and the farmers of this village would get a yield of Darhai( 5 kg) while sowing a Mound( 50 kg) so this village was called MANDARHI and later on MANDANI. Early settlers and Demography: In the beginning a few tribes of Yousafzai,s and Mohmands were arrived and started developing the arid non agricultural land.

Over the next six years, the movement spread across the nation with offices opening in Massachusetts, California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio. In 1922 the organization began publishing Interpreter Releases, a weekly immigration law update with 48 issues/year. In 1924 the National Origins Act, severely restricting the number of immigrants entering the country was passed as well as the Labor Appropriation Act which officially established the Border Patrol. By 1924 the number of International Institutes had grown to 55 and reached across the country to Los Angeles. Activities  The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) administers domestic programs related to refugee resettlement and placement, foreign-born victims of human trafficking, and unaccompanied immigrant children. Its international programs focus on defending the rights of refugees and asylum seekers. It is a partnership between USCRI and the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Each child helped by the Center is under age 18 and without a parent or resources in the United States. The Center holds pro bono trainings throughout the United States for potential volunteer attorneys. World Refugee Survey The World Refugee Survey is an annual USCRI report presenting information on refugees, internally displaced persons and asylum seekers. The country-by- country analysis is based on information collected from governments, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations and field visits. Each country profiled in the Survey is given a grade. Countries are rated according to refugees' enjoyment of rights under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and are graded on: 1) Refoulement/Physical Protection 2) Freedom of Movement and Residence 3) Detention/Access to Courts 4) Right to Earn a Livelihood and 5) Public Relief and Education. On June 19, 2008, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants and its research partners released the World Refugee Survey 2008 with events around the world. Within the annual publication, USCRI released a list of the Ten Worst Places for Refugees. Countries and regions were graded based on their commitment to standards outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. As determined by the Committee, the 'Ten Worst Places' were: Bangladesh, China, Europe, Iraq, Kenya, Malaysia, Russia, Sudan, and Thailand. Sixty countries hosting the largest numbers of refugees were profiled in the 2008 survey.

Carved by the Radovna River, it is the continuation of the Radovna Valley. The sheer canyon walls are high, with a total slope measuring about . The stream has created many erosive features such as pools and rapids, and terminates in the picturesque ≈†um Falls (literally, 'noisy falls'), the largest river waterfall in Slovenia. History Video of ≈Ωumer Galleries Until 1890, the gorge was mainly inaccessible, except for two points at which the Radovna could be reached, and a bridge over ≈†um Falls was already built in 1878. The rest of the gorge was explored in 1891 by the mayor of Gorje, Jakob ≈Ωumer, and by Benedikt Lergetporer, a prominent photographer of the era. In 1893 the gorge was equipped with wooden observation walkways and bridges with great effort and was opened to the public on August 26, 1893. The walkways, which were later named ≈Ωumer Galleries () in the most prominent part of the gorge, have been renovated several times since. A hydroelectric dam has also been built below the gorge and an arch railway bridge for the Bohinj Railway. The bridge, built in 1904 and 1905 of cut stone, is the largest stone arch railway bridge preserved in its entirety in Slovenia. It is long, wide and high. Stone arch railway bridge over the Radovna Rapids in the upper Vintgar Gorge Name The word vintgar is derived from German Windegg(er) 'place exposed to the wind' via the hamlet of Vintgar at the head of the gorge in the village of Podhom. Another explanation claims that it derives from the German name Weingarten 'vineyard', referring to vineyards in Podhom or to the gorge resembling a wine glass in shape. As the first mountain gorge in the area to be made accessible to tourists, the word vintgar has been generalized in Slovene to refer to other scenic, protected gorges, e.g. the (), the () on Pohorje, and the Ribnica Gorge () in Bohinj. Geology Before the last ice age, the Radovna River flowed eastward. After being dammed by the ice and detritus of the Bohinj Glacier, the resulting lake cut a new path northeast through a soft layer of Triassic limestone between the hills Bor≈°t () and Hom (), towards the Upper Sava Valley.

Originally, the plan for the courthouse and an office building for White House staff had called for the historic houses on both sides of Lafayette Square to be razed. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, a believer in historic preservation, urged President John F. Kennedy to find an alternative solution. Kennedy tapped architect John Carl Warnecke to come up with a plan to preserve the houses. Warnecke and Jacqueline Kennedy envisioned that the courthouse and the New Executive Office Building, a twin structure to be built on the other side of Lafayette Square, would form a backdrop for the historic houses. The two buildings remain distinctive in their own right. The Building Committee included Chief Judge John Marvin Jones, Commissioner Marion Tinsley Bennett, and Chief Commissioner Arnold Wilson Cowen. The building was dedicated on September 20, 1967. The courthouse was initially built for the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the United States Court of Claims, so when the two courts were abolished and merged to create the Federal Circuit in 1982, they already had a domicile in common.

Besides Geldern, other towns in the Prussian duchy were Horst, Venray, and Viersen, the latter of which was an exclave surrounded by the Duchy of J√ºlich. Prussian Guelders was part of the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle within the Holy Roman Empire. Prussian Guelders was occupied by Revolutionary France in 1794 and later annexed into the First French Empire as part of the Roer Department. After the Napoleonic Wars, the western regions became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while the eastern regions, such as Geldern and Viersen, were made part of the new Prussian province of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg. These latter regions, until then linguistically and culturally Dutch, rapidly became Germanized.

Phenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde that consists of acetaldehyde bearing a phenyl substituent; the parent member of the phenylacetaldehyde class of compounds. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an alpha-CH2-containing aldehyde and a member of phenylacetaldehydes. Phenylacetaldehyde is one important oxidation-related aldehyde. Exposure to styrene gives phenylacetaldehyde as a secondary metabolite. Styrene has been implicated as reproductive toxicant, neurotoxicant, or carcinogen in vivo or in vitro. Phenylacetaldehyde could be formed by diverse thermal reactions during the cooking process together with C8 compounds is identified as a major aroma‚Äìactive compound in cooked pine mushroom. Phenylacetaldehyde is readily oxidized to phenylacetic acid. Therefore will eventually be hydrolyzed and oxidized to yield phenylacetic acid that will be excreted primarily in the urine in conjugated form. Natural occurrence Phenylacetaldehyde occurs extensively in nature because it can be biosynthetically derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. Natural sources of the compound include chocolate, buckwheat, flowers, and communication pheromones from various insect orders. It is notable for being a floral attractant for numerous species of Lepidoptera; for example, it is the strongest floral attractor for the cabbage looper moth. UsesFragrances and flavors= The aroma of pure substance can be described as honey-like, sweet, rose, green, grassy and is added to fragrances to impart hyacinth, narcissi, or rose nuances. For similar reasons the compound can sometimes be found in flavored cigarettes and beverages. Historically, before biotechnology approaches were developed, phenylacetaldehyde was also used to produce phenylalanine via the Strecker reaction as a step in the production of aspartame sweetener. =Polymers= Phenylacetaldehyde is used in the synthesis of polyesters where it serves as a rate-controlling additive during polymerization. =Natural Medicine= Phenylacetaldehyde is responsible for the antibiotic activity of maggot therapy. =MAOI= Theoretically, hydrazone formation and subsequent reduction of the phenylethylidenehydrazine gives phenelzine. Preparation Phenylacetaldehyde can be obtained via various synthetic routes and precursors. Notable examples include: * Isomerization of styrene oxide. * Dehydrogenation of 2-Phenylethanol over silver or gold catalysts. * Darzens reaction between benzaldehyde and chloroacetate esters. * Wacker oxidation of styrene. * Hofmann rearrangement of Cinnamamide (aka (2E)-3-Phenylacrylamide). * Oxidation of Cyclooctatetraene with aqueous Mercury(II) sulfate. * Strecker degradation of phenylalanine. Reactivity Phenylacetaldehyde is often contaminated with polystyrene oxide polymer because of the especial lability of the benzylic alpha proton and the reactivity of the aldehyde. Aldol condensation of the initial dimer gives rise to a range of Michael acceptors and donors.

Cunningham is a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. He began his career in academe as a member of the faculty at the University of Kentucky, where he taught mathematics for five years. He made his first return to Tennessee, to his alma mater, in fact, when he was appointed dean of continuing education and mathematics faculty member at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, in 1974. He served a year as an American Council on Education Fellow with the Chancellor of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and the President of the University of Tennessee. He left Chattanooga in 1979 to become vice president for academic affairs, dean of the faculty, and professor of mathematics at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania. In 1984 he was named president there where he remained until 2000, when he was elected vice chancellor by Sewanee's board of trustees and made his second Tennessee homecoming. He served in this position until 2010. Highlights of Cunningham's service include a wide range of construction projects that take in both new facilities and major renovations, and a capital campaign, The Sewanee Call, which exceeded its $185 million goal to raise more than $205 million. The first two major projects completed under Cunningham were Humphreys Hall, the first new residence hall in more than 30 years, and Nabit Art Building, a project long sought and long deferred. Cunningham gained control of the Phi Delta Theta house for conversion to university use as the McGriff Alumni House. Gailor Hall was renovated to become the Gailor Center for Languages and Literature, St. Luke's Hall was converted into a desirable residence hall, and All Saints' Chapel was refurbished. Cunningham presided over the celebration of the sesquicentennial anniversary of the university's founding in 2007-08, which coincided with the end of the successful capital campaign and the dedication of the state-of-the-art science building Spencer Hall. During the final year of Dr. Cunningham's service, a major renovation and addition to Snowden Hall took shape as a new home for the forestry, geology and natural resources departments.

In that year many Latino students walked out in protest over lack of Latino history in secondary schools in Texas, Latino faculty members and related issues. This led to the start of Jacinto Trevi√±o College in Mercedes, Texas. The concept was initially presented at a plenary session of the Mexican American Youth Organization holding its annual statewide meeting at La Lomita, a building which had been a seminary, just south of Mission, Texas in December 1969. In 1971 Dr. Leonard Mestas and Andre Guerrero, who had been associated with Jacinto Trevi√±o College, left due to internal differences and founded Juarez‚ÄìLincoln University in Fort Worth, Texas, as part of the Antioch Network of study centers. Those of the original group who had left completed their graduate work towards a Masters in Education at the new center. It moved the next year to St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. St. Edward's became known for its high rating of faculty personnel and four-year business degree program. Antioch Juarez-Lincoln center moved to its own Austin campus in 1975 when it had about 1200 students. It received national and regional accreditation from its inception in 1971 until its closure in 1991. Juarez-Lincoln kept its affiliation with Antioch which had a long-standing affiliation with UREHE, the Union for Research and Experimentation in Higher Education. UREHE member institutions were at the forefront of curricular and educational model delivery changes in U.S. institutions of higher learning. Among those changes were the recognition that adult members of society could return to college and receive college level credit for equivalent work experiences. Other variants of the traditional delivery model included the incorporation of supervised independent study and research, and competency based college level learning. Juarez Lincoln was also the creator and sponsor of a Migrant Education Clearinghouse, and supported other projects such as a Chicana Leadership Development group and the League of United Chicano Artists (LUCHA) which held art expositions at the center.

For example, if a person is unconscious as a result of injuries sustained during a traffic collision, medical treatment may be provided to that person, despite the unconscious person being unable to expressly grant consent for that treatment. The term is most commonly encountered in the context of United States drunk driving laws. There are no U.S. states that allow implied consent as an excuse for rape in a court of law. Driving while intoxicated All U.S. states have driver licensing laws which state that a licensed driver has given their implied consent to a certified breathalyzer or by a blood sample by their choice, or similar manner of determining blood alcohol concentration. Implied consent laws may result in punishment for those who refuse to cooperate with blood alcohol testing after an arrest for suspected impaired driving, including civil consequences such as a driver's license suspension. In 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States in Birchfield v. North Dakota held that both breath tests and blood tests constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment, concluding that requiring breath tests is constitutional without a search warrant, however, requiring more intrusive blood tests involving piercing the skin is not, as the goal of traffic safety can be obtained by less invasive means. Specifically addressing implied consent laws, the court in the Birchfield opinion stated that while their \\"prior opinions have referred approvingly to the general concept of implied-consent laws\\" that \\"there must be a limit to the consequences to which motorists may be deemed to have consented by virtue of a decision to drive on public roads\\" and \\"that motorists could be deemed to have consented to only those conditions that are 'reasonable' in that they have a 'nexus' to the privilege of driving\\". In 2016, People v. Arredondo, the California Courts of appeals debated whether authorities could seize an unwarranted blood sample from an unconscious person suspected of driving under the influence without offending the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches or seizures. The court ruled that the defendant \\"consented to such a search in advance solely by operation of the statute in California, which declares that anyone who drives a vehicle in this state is \\"deemed to have given his or her consent\\" to blood alcohol testing under specified conditions.People v. Arredondo, 245 Cal. App. 4th 186, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 563 (Ct. App. 2016). Though Arredondo was unconscious at the time his blood was drawn, the court found that the \\"warrantless search was justified on the consent since California's \\"implied consent\\" law states \\"one who drives a motor vehicle in this state is \\"deemed\\" to consent to blood alcohol testing\\". Moreover, the court ruled that the extraction was justified by \\"exigent circumstances, statutorily implied consent, the officer's belief that the extraction was lawful in light of long-standing practice under prior case law and good faith reliance on the implied consent statute\\". In 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States in Schmerber v. California held that a warrantless blood sample is justified under the Fourth Amendment's pressing circumstances because alcohol in one's blood would be diminished by the body's natural metabolic system if officers were to wait for a warrant. The Fifth Amendment only applies to interrogation and testimony and does not prohibit blood tests. The case resulted in a conviction because it was decided that blood test results do not constitute testimony, proof of a confession or any other communicative acts.Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S. Ct. 1826, 16 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1966). =Non-evidential testing= In the United States, implied consent laws generally do not apply to Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) testing (small handheld devices, as opposed to evidential breath test devices). For a handheld field breath tester to be used as evidential breath testing, the device must be properly certified and calibrated, evidential procedures must be followed, and it may be necessary to administer an \\"implied consent\\" warning to the suspect prior to testing. In most US jurisdictions, participation in a PBT test is voluntary; however for some violations, such as refusals by commercial drivers or by drivers under 21 years of age, some US jurisdictions may impose implied consent consequences for a PBT refusal. For example, the state of Michigan has a roadside PBT lawMichigan Vehicle Code ¬ß 257.625a that requires motorist a preliminary breath test;Michigan State Police **Breath Test Program and Training Information** however, for non- commercial drivers Michigan's penalties are limited to a \\"civil infraction\\" penalty, with no violation \\"points\\". Participation in \\"field sobriety tests\\" (FSTs or SFSTs) is voluntary in the US.DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test, NOLO Press (\\"As a general rule (and unlike chemical testing), there is no legal penalty for refusing to take these tests although the arresting officer can typically testify as to your refusal in court.\\")Findlaw Can I Refuse to Take Field Sobriety Tests?  Sexual assault  In Canada, implied consent has not been a defence for sexual assault since the 1999 Supreme Court of Canada case of R v Ewanchuk, where the court unanimously ruled that consent has to be explicit, instead of merely \\"implied\\". In the United States, rape has traditionally been defined as the victim's nonconsent to sexual intercourse.Wicktom, Cynthia Ann. \\"Focusing on the Offender's Forceful Conduct: A Proposal for the Redefiniton of Rape Laws.\\" George Washington Law Review 56.2 (1988): 399-430. However, \\"the law of rape is founded on a paradigm of violent stranger rape which fails to clearly proscribe less violent rapes.\\" Remick, Lani Anne. \\"Read her lips: An argument for a verbal consent standard in rape.\\" University of Pennsylvania Law Review 141.3 (1993): 1103-1151. This ambiguity requires the courts to determine whether the victim consented or not. During this process it is possible that, \\"courts examine objective evidence of the woman's state of mind, such as her behavior during the alleged rape and her character in general.\\" This would allow the defense a chance to convince the court that consent was in some way implied by the victim. Many actions can be perceived by the court as implied consent: having a previous relationship with the alleged rapist (e.g. befriending, dating, cohabitating, or marrying),Balos, Beverly, and Mary Louise Fellows. \\"Guilty of the Crime of Trust: Nonstranger Rape.\\" Minn. L. Rev. 75 (1990): 599. consenting to sexual contact on previous occasions, flirting, wearing \\"provocative\\" clothing,Tchen, Christina M. \\"Rape Reform and a Statutory Consent Defense.\\" J. Crim. L. & Criminology 74 (1983): 1518. etc. These actions are not explicitly defined by the law as indicators of consent; however, the court may come to the conclusion that these actions in some way implied consent, as has often been the result in non-stranger rape cases. Implied consent may also be used as a defense in the case of violent stranger rape. Common law rape has generally been defined as \\"the act of a man having unlawful carnal knowledge of a female over the age of ten years by force without the consent and against the will of the victim\\"Hazel v. State, 157 A. 2d 922 While force is a key element of rape, the evidence must conclude that either the victim resisted and their resistance was overcome by force, or that they were prevented from resisting because their safety was threatened. However, since resistance is relevant to crimes of sexual assault, the presence or absence of it depends on the facts and circumstances in each case. While consent may involve submission, submission itself does not necessarily imply consent. In other words, \\"submission to a compelling force, or as a result of being put in fear, is not consent\\" since it has been proven that non-resistance or compliance with an attacker's request is a way to protect oneself from additional and often more severe abuse. \\"Genuine and continuing fear of such harm\\", or abuse, \\"on the part of the persecuting witness\\" is a significant factor in determining whether the attacker committed a \\"felonious and forcible act against the will and consent of the prosecuting witness\\". As a tactic for survival, rape counselors advise women to \\"do whatever is necessary to protect themselves from physical injury and to save their lives\\" in a threatening situation. =Spousal rape= In many common law jurisdictions, a couple who married were deemed to have given \\"implied consent\\" to have sex with each other, a doctrine which barred prosecution of a spouse for rape. This doctrine is now considered obsolete in Western countries.See e.g. R v R [1992] 1 AC 599 In the United States, however, some state legislatures offer leniency to perpetrators of spousal rape.\\"How is Spousal Rape Treated?\\", compiled by the American Prosecutors Research Institute (APRI) These laws typically require the use of physical violence from the perpetrator in order to be considered a felony. Reasons given relate to evidence and the potential for malicious prosecution.Rape and Rape Laws: Sexism in Society and Law, Cal. L. Rev., v. 61, issue 3 (May-1973) In the 1984 Virginia Supreme Court Case Weishaupt v. Commonwealth. it states that \\"[A] wife can unilaterally revoke her implied consent to marital sex where ... *292 she has made manifest her intent to terminate the marital relationship by living separate and apart from her husband; refraining from voluntary sexual intercourse with her husband; and, in light of all the circumstances, conducting herself in a manner that establishes a de facto end to the marriage.\\" This allows the spouse to commit what would be considered rape outside of marriage, inside the confines of the marriage as long as the de facto end of the marriage has not occurred. Again in the Virginia Supreme Court in 1984 Kizer v. Commonwealth upheld the ruling. Idaho State legislature states, \\"No person shall be convicted of rape for any act or acts with that person's spouse‚Ä¶\\" unless the perpetrator used physical violence. Similar to Idaho, South Carolina State legislature only considers spousal sexual battery as a felony if \\"accomplished through use of aggravated force.\\" Oklahoma State Law, being one of the more extreme examples, excludes spousal rape from their definition of rape by claiming, \\"Rape is an act of sexual intercourse involving vaginal or anal penetration accomplished with a male or female who is not the spouse of the perpetrator‚Ä¶\\" Commonwealth v. Chretien in Massachusetts in 1981 stated that, \\"There was no unfairness in subjecting a defendant to criminal prosecution for rape of his wife under G. L. c. 265, Section 22, as amended by St. 1974, c. 474, Section 1, which this court construes to eliminate the common law spousal exclusion, where the rape occurred after the wife had obtained a judgment of divorce nisi and was therefore unlawful even under the common law.\\" They concluded that the husband could be convicted of rape only because the wife had already ordered divorce papers. Some states however do not offer leniency to perpetrators of spousal rape. In State v. Smith 1981 in New Jersey one of the concurring opinions states, \\"The statute has never contained any exception or exemption. I would construe it to mean exactly what it says and would hold that a husband who had carnal knowledge of his wife forcibly and against her will was guilty of rape.\\" This case affirmed that rape can still take place while a marriage is still ongoing. Similarly in People vs. Liberta 1984 in New York, the opinion states about the Marriage Exception, \\"This statement is an apt characterization of the marital exemption; it lacks a rational basis, and therefore violates the equal protection clauses of both the Federal and State Constitutions\\"  Medical care First aid= In the United States, if a person is at risk of death or injury but unconscious or otherwise unable to respond, other people including members of the public and paramedics may assume implied consent to touch the person to provide first aid. Many states have Good Samaritan laws that protect persons giving aid from legal liability, but the type of persons (laypeople versus healthcare professionals) and the amount of protection varies. = Reproductive healthcare = Studies have indicated that implied consent is questionable due to the value patients place on being informed on even the simplest procedures being done to them. There are varying events where implied consent can be seen in reproductive healthcare. An example of implied consent being utilized is when complication arise during routine childbirth and actions need to be taken in order to help the mother and fetus. If complications arise during a natural delivery, an emergency cesarean delivery may be performed, even if the mother had previously rejected the option. However this can only occur if the life of the mother or fetus is in danger. Implied consent is narrow in that \\"intervention must be necessary, not merely convenient\\". Implied consent in law indicates that \\"medical necessity requires a genuine perception of emergency, and a reasonable response\\". Some doctors have tried to claim implied consent in the sterilization of women belonging to ethnic minority groups in Europe. This then led to the formation of laws concerning human rights by international treaties and national legislatures that state consent must be given freely by the person in regards to their sterilization. =Organ donation= Some countries have legislation allowing for implied consent for organ donation, asking people to opt out of organ donation instead of opt in, but allow family refusals.Keeping kidneys, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, Volume 90, Number 10, October 2012, 713-792 Other contextsCourt procedure= Typically, a party has the right to object in court to a line of questioning or at the introduction of a particular piece of evidence. If the party fails to object in a timely fashion, he is deemed to have waived his right to object and cannot raise the objection on appeal. This is a form of implied consent.

It is between Piccadilly and Curzon Street and has a village-like atmosphere. It was associated with upmarket prostitutes from its building up until at least the 1980s. In the 1920s, it hosted leading writers and artists such as Anthony Powell, Michael Arlen and Sophie Fedorovitch. Jeffrey Archer met Monica Coghlan here in the 1980s.  History  The square was fully built up between 1735 and 1746 by Edward Shepherd from an open area called Brook Field, through which flowed the Tyburn, and where a May fair was held, from which the surrounding area of Mayfair derives its name. A local architect, he was commissioned to develop the site and work was completed in the mid-18th century. It contained paved alleys, a duck pond, and a two-storey market topped by a theatre. Shepherd Market During the 1920s this was a rundown area, popular with writers and artists such as Michael Arlen and Sophie Fedorovitch. Arlen rented rooms opposite The Grapes public house and used the public place as the setting for his best-selling 1924 novel The Green Hat, which prompted Anthony Powell to move into the area in 1926. It has been associated with upmarket prostitutes from its building up until at least the 1980s. When Olivia Manning and her husband Reggie Smith lived at 50a, she found the prostitutes \\"fascinating\\".

First Tech has over 620,000 members, and over 12 billion dollars in assets with 41 branches located mostly in high technology business centers of California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and five other states and Puerto Rico. It was the first financial institution to offer telephone interactive voice response access and online banking.  History  The credit union was founded as Tektronix Federal Credit Union, formed by seven Tektronix employees on January 14, 1952. In 1961, the name was changed to Tektronix Employees Federal Credit Union to reflect the credit union's membership. From very early on, technical innovation was emphasized and reflected in First Tech's motto of \\"Think Forward\\". As early as 1976, the credit union began using computers for online data processing. By 1979, Tektronix Employees Federal Credit Union had begun the use of ATMs. In 1985, the credit union unveiled \\"Call 24\\", which allowed members to check balances and transfer funds by phone. In 1986, the name was changed to First Technology Credit Union and the membership was opened to include employees in technology industries of the Pacific Northwest. In 1989, First Technology Credit Union developed and implemented the first online banking. In 1992, Microsoft became involved. The 1995 launch of the company's website paved the way for the credit union to become the second financial institution in the world to perform secure internet transactions. In 1997, the name was shortened to First Tech Credit Union. First Tech began offering mobile banking in 2000, account aggregation in 2001, and biometric two-factor authentication in 2007. With over 156,000 members, and over 1.8 billion dollars in assets in 2007, First Tech was one of the largest state chartered credit unions in the Pacific Northwest.

History A streetcar at the stop in 1980 When the M Ocean View line opened on October 6, 1925, it ran along the west side of 19th Avenue; a second set of lanes was added later, placing the line in the road's median. Several stations with small side platforms were located along 19th Avenue, including one at Winston Drive; it became more important after the adjacent Stonestown Galleria opened in 1952. In the early 1970s, Muni began planning an extension of the J Church line over new track to Balboa Park station, then over the M Ocean View line to the high-ridership San Francisco State University and Stonestown Galleria stations. A Final Environmental Impact Statement for the new track was released in 1983; it was opened for non-revenue moves in August 1991 and began revenue service in June 1993. Original plans called for the two existing stations to be rebuilt with high-level island platforms, and a pocket track to allow J Church trains to turn back. After objections from neighbors, the pocket track was removed from the plan. The first phase of the 19th Ave. Platform & Trackway Improvement Project required the line to replaced by buses south of St. Francis Circle from June 19 to October 23, 1993; the new platforms at the two stations were opened when service was restored. The second phase required full bustitution beginning on July 30, 1994; rail service was restored to Stonestown on November 19 for holiday shopping, and on the rest of the line on January 28, 1995. Some weekday J and M service was through-routed from 1995 to 1998, but full through-routing was never implemented.

A member of the Bush family, he is a distant relative of both President George H. W. Bush and President George W. Bush., biographical statement issued by United States Department of State, 20 Dec 2004 Biography Bush graduated from Dartmouth College in 1818, and then studied theology at Princeton Theological Seminary, where he was a tutor 1823‚Äì1824. He was ordained in the Presbyterian ministry, spent four years as a Christian missionary in Indiana, and in 1831 became professor of Hebrew and oriental literature at New York University. His first book The Life of Mohammed was the first American written biography of the religious leader. It refers to Muhammad as \\"remarkable\\" and ‚Äúirresistibly attractive\\", but is a largely negative assessment of him, showing him up as a fraud and hoaxer. It also takes a dim view of the state of Christianity of Muhammad's age. The book fell out of print, but became briefly controversial in Egypt in 2004. \\"Reconsideration: George Bush I\\", Ted Widmer, New York Times Magazine, July 22, 2007 In 1844 Bush published a book entitled The Valley of Vision; or, The Dry Bones of Israel Revived.

In this they are undoubtedly authorized to look for a considerable measure of success, though it be admitted that the bulk of the nation is not to be converted till after their restoration; for it is only upon the coming together of bone to his bone that the Spirit of life comes into them, and they stand up an exceeding great army.\\" This, according to Bush, would benefit not only the Jews, but all of mankind, forming a ‚Äúlink of communication‚Äù between humanity and God. ‚ÄúIt will blaze in notoriety....It will flash a splendid demonstration upon all kindreds and tongues of the truth.‚ÄùPower, Faith, and Fantasy by Michael B.

It was renamed Fatehpur Thakiala to honour the late Sardar Fateh Muhammad Khan Karelvi. It is also the birthplace of the former president and prime minister of Azad Kashmir, Sardar Sikandar Hayat Khan. Location The town of Nakyal is 1524 m above sea level, and is 40 km from Kotli city. Nakyal is in a valley nearly 3 kilometres from the Line of Control. Nearby Tatapani is one of the five crossing points at the Line of Control that were opened for the exchange of relief goods between Pakistani and Indian Administered parts of Kashmir after the devastating October 8 earthquake.

It was acquired by Adobe Systems in 2009. Until 2011, Omniture operated as a business unit within Adobe as the \\"Omniture Business Unit\\", but as of 2012 Adobe began retiring the Omniture name as former Omniture products were integrated into the Adobe Marketing Cloud.  History  Prior to the development of Omniture, Josh James and John Pestana with Jeremy Young (founder of Uberplay) to develop Omniture's predecessor, SuperStats. SuperStats was developed as a software as a service (SaaS), which worked as an analytic software for small and medium-sized businesses to track statistics in real time. Jeremy Young eventually sold his portion of the interest back to his partners in order to focus on the development of his other businesses. Josh James sold the small business and consumer sectors in order to focus on enterprise level software, which lead to the development of Omniture in 1996. Omniture was founded by Josh James and John Pestana, and was backed by venture capitalists including Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, University Venture Fund, and Scale Venture Partners. During a period of rapid growth, the company was one of Inc. Magazine's 500 fastest-growing private companies. Omniture was listed on the NASDAQ with OMTR as its ticker symbol in 2006. Omniture bought behavioral targeting company Touch Clarity for $51.5 million in 2007. In late 2007 the company acquired web analytics company Visual Sciences, Inc. (formerly WebSideStory) for $394 million, and also purchased Offermatica for $65 million. In September 2008 it agreed to acquire the site search and merchandising aspects of Israeli e-commerce search solution provider Mercado for $6.5 million. Thursday, August 27, 2020 On September 15, 2009, Omniture, Inc. and Adobe Systems announced that Adobe would be acquiring Omniture for $1.8 billion. The deal was completed on October 23, 2009, and is now joined by other Adobe acquisitions such as Day Software and Efficient Frontier, as the main components of Adobe's Digital Marketing Business Unit. Adobe vacated the former Omniture offices in Orem, Utah in November 2012, moving a large portion of its Digital Marketing Business Unit to a new facility in Lehi, Utah. It is used in web analytics mainly for analyzing the data.  Criticism  Omniture has been accused of using domain names that resemble local network IP addresses (such as 192.168.112.2O7.net, which contains a capital \\"O\\", not a zero) in order to hide their involvement in data mining. This has led to speculation that the domain name is used to mischievously or criminally trick users or firewall rules. Omniture's SiteCatalyst and SearchCenter products use the 2o7.net domain name. Omniture collects data from Apple, Amazon and Adobe, who use Omniture to collect usage statistics across their products. It is possible to opt out of the Omniture data-collection system, and to block the tracking.

He was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly in 1937 for the Muslim League and alone represented the League in opposing the Unionist Party (Punjab) for 7 years in the assembly.Biographies of All India Muslim League Working Committee Members, Islamabad, Pakistan: National Archives of Pakistan, 1994, p.137 (Supplement) =Bhagat Singh trial= In 1929, when Bhagat Singh was tried in Lahore, Allama Iqbal, Malik Barkat Ali, Nanka Chand and Norang jointly moved a resolution in the Lahore High Court's Bar condemning this trial. Malik Barkat Ali was a vigorous supporter of Allama Iqbal until Iqbal's death in 1938. =Pakistan Resolution= In March 1940, the now famous Lahore Resolution for the creation of Pakistan was approved under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Malik Barkat Ali also participated in that process as a member of All India Muslim League's Working Committee. In his later years, however, he was very impressed by Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari and he thus underwent a considerable change in his ideas, and joined the All India Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul- Islam.Biographies of All India Muslim League Working Committee Members, 1993, p.137 Barkat Ali also served as a secretary of the Anjuman-e-Himayat-e-Islam for some time. Death and legacy Malik Barkat Ali died on 5 April 1946, at Lahore while addressing a special tribunal in the Burma Fraud Case.Biographies of All India Muslim League Working Committee Members, 1994, p.137 At a Special Session of the Muslim League held in 1946, the Quaid-i-Azam paid him the tribute saying: =Commemorative postage stamp= In 1990, Pakistan Post Office issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honour in its 'Pioneers of Freedom' series.

The bypass switch or bypass tap removes this point of failure by automatically 'switching traffic via bypass mode' to keep the critical network link up. A bypass switch has four ports. Two network ports create an in-line connection in the network link that is to be monitored. This connection is fully passive; if the bypass switch itself loses power, traffic continues to flow unimpeded through the link. Two monitor ports are used to connect the in-line monitoring appliance. During normal operation, the bypass switch passes all network traffic through the appliance as if it were directly in-line itself. But when the in-line appliance loses power, is disconnected, or otherwise fails, the bypass switch passes traffic directly between its network ports, bypassing the appliance, and ensuring that traffic continues to flow on the network link. A bypass switch or TAP monitors the health of the active, in-line appliance by sending heartbeats to the in-line security appliance as long as the in band security appliance is on-line, the heartbeat packets will be returned to the switch/TAP, and the link traffic will continue to flow through the in-line security appliance. If the heartbeat packets are not returned to the TAP (indicating that the in-line security appliance has gone off-line), the TAP will automatically bypass the in band security appliance and keep the link traffic flowing. The TAP also removes the heartbeat packets before sending the network traffic back onto the critical link. In some products, when the bypass switch shunts traffic around the monitoring appliance, the monitor ports revert to acting like a network tap, mirroring the half-duplex traffic received at the network ports to the monitor ports. In this mode, an attached IPS appliance can be used as an intrusion detection system (IDS) to passively monitor the traffic without affecting it. This mode is useful for analyzing the effectiveness of a signature set before switching to IPS mode and potentially disrupting network traffic. Multi- segment bypass switches provide a number of independent bypass switches in a single chassis, providing higher density in the equipment rack.  Terminology  Bypass TAP - Normal Mode: traffic flows through the network TAP before it travels through the appliance and back onto the network Bypass TAP - Bypass Mode: heartbeat packets are sent out to the in-line security appliance, once the appliance is back on-line, it will begin returning the heartbeat packets back to the TAP indicating that the appliance is ready to resume bypass TAP normal mode. The TAP will then direct the network traffic back through the in- line security appliance along with the heartbeat packets placing the appliance back in-line.  Advantages  Using an external bypass switch to connect an in-line appliance such as a NGFW, IPS, or DDoS has several benefits.Sys-Con Media.com - Net Optics, Inc. Introduces iBypass for Fail-Safe IPS Security Deployments It keeps network traffic flowing when the in-line appliance fails. It allows the in-line appliance to be removed or serviced without impacting network traffic. For example, an IPS can be taken offline to upgrades, maintenance or troubleshooting The in-line appliance can be moved from one network segment to another without impacting network traffic. Note that the latter two advantages are not provided by internal bypass-switch functionality that may be integrated within some NGFW/IPS appliances. Some bypass TAPs support multiple modes and can be used throughout the networks lifetime, ie: aggregation, regeneration/SPAN, breakout/normal.  Disadvantages  Bypass switches and TAPs add acquisition cost to the monitoring solution, although they may save cost in the long run by increasing network uptime. Bypass switches move the single point of failure from the in-line monitoring appliance to the bypass switch itself. This should be a net gain in reliability, because the bypass switch is a simpler device than the monitoring appliance, and because it is designed for fault-tolerance. Nevertheless, reliability is an important criterion when evaluating bypass switch solutions.  Technical information  Bypass switches increase network reliability through several mechanisms including passive in-line connections, link detection, and heartbeat packets. The two network ports in a bypass switch create a fully passive in-line connection that maintains traffic flow even in the absence of power. For fiber links, a normally closed optical switch creates a path for light to flow unimpeded through the device when power is absent. For copper links, micro-relays connect the two ports when power is absent. The bypass switch monitors the status of the links between its monitor ports and the in-line appliance. If a link goes down, the bypass switch immediately switches into bypass- mode. Some manufacturers of bypass TAPs/switches still send traffic to the appliance during bypass mode. When the link comes back up again, the bypass switch returns to bypass-off normal. Some bypass switches send a heartbeat packet through the monitoring appliance in order to ensure that the appliance is passing traffic. If the heartbeat packet does not return to the bypass switch, the appliance is assumed to be down, and the switch goes into bypass-on mode, excluding the appliance from the traffic path. The bypass switch continues to transmit heartbeat packets to the appliance, and when they are again returned by the appliance, the bypass switch changes back to bypass-off mode and the appliance resumes receiving traffic.... Whenever the bypass switch transitions to bypass mode for any reason, the link may be temporarily dropped. A good bypass switch reconnects the link in under 1 second, but the network may take several seconds to re- establish communications on link.  Device management  Bypass switches may be managed through any of several interfaces: a command-line interface (CLI), a Web browser-based interface, or a platform-based SNMP tool. Management functions may include configuring an IP address for SNMP traps, retrieving RMON statistics, and setting parameters for the heartbeat packet such as packet contents, timing, and retry counts.

It hosts ice hockey and curling events and is home to the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League. It opened on August 19, 2011 and seats 4,500 spectators. It replaced the Warriors' former arena, the Moose Jaw Civic Centre. History By the early 2000s, the Moose Jaw Civic Centre faced criticism that it was too small and not up to standards for the Warriors hockey team. A civic referendum in 2006 approved construction of a new $36.3 million arena, with the city contributing $15 million. Soon after, plans emerged for a more ambitious $61.2 million facility, with $36.5 million coming from the city. A group of citizens sued the city, claiming that the referendum vote in 2006 did not allow the city to spend more than the original amount. The case was dismissed, and civic voters approved the project again in 2009 with a second referendum. The entire project cost about $61 million, with the city of Moose Jaw paying $34.5 million. Provincial and federal governments paid $8 million and community fundraising committed to $10 million. Groundbreaking for the new facility took place on July 9, 2009. Ten- year naming rights to the facility were sold to The Mosaic Company for $150,000 per year, beginning in 2011.

Career Starting out as a rally co-driver, and later moving into the sport of Autotesting, Russ Swift has built his career on a sturdy motorsport foundation. After being asked to demonstrate his driving skills locally, Russ realised there could be a demand for precision driving skills to be displayed nationwide. Swift's driving skills were memorably put to the test in 1987, when he performed stunts in a crowded parking lot in an Austin Montego for a television advertisement. The close-ups were done by an actor, but Swift (uncredited) was responsible for the driving. It was during the filming of the advertisement that Russ came up with the Parallel Park man≈ìuvre, which has remained his \\"trademark\\" to this day. Russ previously held the world record for this man≈ìuvre, parking in a space just 33 cm longer than the car. He has since been beaten by Peter Bell, who did it in a space 27 cm longer than the car.http://www.socialtimes.com/2010/07/guinness-world-record-videos/ The Montego \\"Car Park\\" commercial was featured at the Cannes Film Festival and in an American review it was deemed the world's most imaginative car commercial. Swift is the leader of the Russ Swift Mini Display Team, who perform driving displays for motor shows, commercials, vehicle launches, and other events. Typically they use a completely standard Mini Cooper S and/or a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, though Russ has performed in countless other vehicles, including Peugeots, Vauxhalls, Nissans, MGs, Land Rovers, Black Cabs, Subarus, and 13-tonne lorries. Swift's career has also seen the use of the classic Minis, which he used to capture four British Autotest Championships and a rally win in Sweden in the early 1980s. Swift has collaborated for TV commercials with Opel, Fiat, Standard Bank, MG, Mini. He has cooperated with the TV shows Top Gear, 5th Gear, Guinness World Records, GMTV, Learner Drivers (title sequence), and others, and as an advisor to many police, military, royal and diplomatic drivers. Swift has held three Guinness World Records and has done more than 8,000 stunt shows in 50 countries. Russ has collaborated in Jeremy Clarkson's videos and on two episodes of Top Gear, in which he proved that elderly people needn't be slow and poor drivers, by teaching grannies to do donuts and handbrake parking. =Guinness World Records= *Parallel parking in tightest space *J-turn in tightest space *Fastest time doing 10 do- nuts.

Personal life Swift currently resides in the village of Finghall, North Yorkshire. His son, Paul Swift, is also an Autotest champion.

In December 2004, the subcommittee's chairman Senator Norm Coleman called for UN Secretary-general Kofi Annan to resign because of the \\"UN's utter failure to detect or stop Saddam's abuses\\" of the program and because of related fraud allegations against Annan's son. In May 2005, the subcommittee held the hearings on their investigation of abuses of the program, including oil smuggling, illegal kickbacks and use of surcharges, and Saddam Hussein's use of oil vouchers for the purpose of buying influence abroad. These hearings covered certain corporations and several well-known political figures, including Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovsky and drew significant media attention for the combative appearance of British politician George Galloway, an anti- Iraq-War member of parliament for RESPECT The Unity Coalition (Respect), who vigorously denied the subcommittee's allegations against him and claimed they were politically motivated.

The Australian Prime Minister John Howard was a supporter of the invasion of Iraq. Indictments and conviction On January 6, 2006, South Korean businessman Tongsun Park was arrested by the FBI in Houston after he was indicted for illegally accepting millions of dollars from Iraq in the UN Oil- for-Food Programme. The criminal charges against him were unsealed in a U.S. District Court in Manhattan. In July 2006, he was convicted on conspiracy charges. He became the first person convicted through the oil-for-food investigation. On February 22, 2007 he was sentenced to five years in prison. He was also fined $15,000 and required to forfeit $1,200,000. On January 16, 2007, former UN official Benon Sevan was indicted by a Manhattan federal prosecutor for taking about $160,000 in bribes. Michael J. Garcia, the U.S. attorney from the Southern District of New York, issued a warrant through Interpol for the arrest of Sevan at his home in Cyprus, as well as a warrant for Efraim \\"Fred\\" Nadler, a New York businessman who was indicted on charges of channelling the illegal payments to Sevan.

Despite the size of the village, it has a swimming facility, a tennis court and a sports centre. Skepplanda has two different schools: Garnvindeskolan (pre-school and grades 1 to 3), Alboskolan (for grades 4 to 6), as well as a daycare centre. The town square, \\"Albotorget\\", is the core of Skepplanda. There, one can find a grocery shop, a hairdresser, a pizza place, a library and a caf√©, as well as a clinic. Across from it, there is a parish. Skepplanda has its own church, founded in the 17th century. It is situated on a hilltop overlooking the main part of the village. The area around Skepplanda mainly consists of forests, meadows, some minor farmland and plains. The town itself is in a valley of sorts, which is open to the southwest. The international road E45, which is one of the longest roads in Europe, passes through some kilometres away. When students in Skepplanda finish the middle school at Alboskolan, most of them continue their studies in a town nearby called √Ñlv√§ngen. √Ñlv√§ngen is just ten minutes away by bus, and there are many more stores and boutiques there than in Skepplanda.  History  During the 1960-70s the village was extended into a residential area, being mainly farmland before that. In the years 1962‚Äì1975, it grew from being a rural church village into a small town. A short industry epoch followed in the 1970s, with the placement of floor tile industry. Nowadays, the business has been largely relocated to nearby towns.

She has written two books of nonfiction and a book of fiction based on her travels and is a contributing editor at National Geographic magazine. Biography Early life = Kira Salak was born on September 4, 1971 in a western suburb of Chicago. Her mother was a waitress and her father repaired mainframe computers. When Salak was 13, her parents sent her to Wayland Academy, a boarding school in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, where she participated in cross- country activities and set a state level track record when she was 14. Though she began training for National and Olympic trials, she dropped out of the sport and decided to travel instead. Kira Salak received her B.F.A. in writing, literature and publishing from Emerson College. She received her M.F.A. in creative writing (fiction) from the University of Arizona. In 2004, she graduated from the University of Missouri, with a PhD in English; her two areas of specialization were 20th century American prose literature and travel literature. =Career = At the age of 24, Salak took a year off from graduate school to backpack around Papua New Guinea, the Pacific Island nation, and became the first American woman to cross the country. Her first book, Four Corners: One Woman‚Äôs Journey into the Heart of Papua New Guinea, describes that journey. After the book was published, an editor of National Geographic Adventure magazine asked her to write for the magazine and Salak's career as a freelance writer began. Salak gained a reputation for being a tough adventurer, surviving war zones, coup attempts, and life-threatening bouts with malaria and cholera (the New York Times described her as a \\"tough, real life Lara Croft\\" and Book Magazine described her as \\"the gutsiest ‚Äì and some say, craziest ‚Äì woman adventurer of our day.\\") Several of Salak's short stories have been published in journals such as Prairie Schooner, The Massachusetts Review, Quarterly West and Witness. One story, \\"Beheadings\\", about a war correspondent's search for her lost brother, is published in the anthology Best New American Voices. According to Salak, she started writing at the age of six. After the death of her brother, Marc, in 2005, Salak took a year off from her magazine work to write her first novel The White Mary. In an interview, she described the experience: :\\"I wrote the entire book not long after my brother died. It was like an obsession. I lived in a tiny basement apartment in Columbia, Missouri, unemployed for a year. I didn't tell anyone what I was doing. It was a very private experience. I almost feel that the book wasn't so much written by me, but channeled through me.\\" Salak now writes regularly for National Geographic Adventure, National Geographic, and other magazines about her travels to places which include Iran, Rwanda, Libya, Burma, Borneo, Uganda and Peru. In 2003, she convinced some Ukrainian gun- runners to fly her to the Democratic Republic of the Congo so she could report on the war. Salak stayed in the Congolese town of Bunia, which was taken over by child soldiers, an experience she described as \\"an endless stream of the worst, most inconceivable acts of inhumanity\\". She received a PEN literary award for her article about that experience. Her articles have also appeared in publications that include the New York Times Magazine, Travel & Leisure, The Washington Post, and Backpacker, and her work has appeared five times in Best American Travel Writing. Her fiction was selected for Best New American Voices (judged by Charles Baxter). Her fiction and nonfiction have appeared in various anthologies, including Adrenaline 2002: The Year's Best Stories of Adventure and Survival, The Best Women's Travel Writing, and Nixon Under the Bodhi Tree and Other Works of Buddhist Fiction.

He was president of the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome, and of the Pontifical Commission for Russia. He was secretly consecrated a bishop and was instrumental in a failed attempt to establish a clandestine hierarchy for the Catholic Church in the Soviet Union during the religious persecutions of the 1920s. Early life Mgr. Michel-Joseph Bourguignon d'Herbigny S.J. D'Herbigny was born in Lille, in northern France. He entered the Jesuit order at the age of seventeen, and studied in Paris, and in Trier in Germany. He was ordained priest on 23 August 1910.Bishop Michel-Joseph Bourguignon d‚ÄôHerbigny, S.J., Catholic Hierarchy In 1911 his thesis on the Russian religious philosopher Vladimir Solovyov was published as Vladimir Soloviev: A Russian Newman, and was awarded a prize by the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. Because of this, he was noticed and investigated by the Sodalitium Pianum. Having become known as the leading Jesuit Russian scholar, d'Herbigny was assigned to a teaching post in Rome in 1921.Charles Frazee (1992) Review of Tretjakewitsch, L√©on, \\"Bishop Michel D'Herbigny SJ and Russia: A Pre-Ecumenical Approach to Christian Unity\\", Russian Review, 51: 592-3. He was appointed president of the Pontifical Oriental Institute in 1922.Hansjakob Stehle (1981) The Eastern Politics of the Vatican, 1917-1979. Ohio University Press. p. 81 He was appointed president of the Pontifical Commission for Russia in 1926. Secret mission to the USSR By 1926 the level of religious persecution in the Soviet Union was such that the entire leadership of the Catholic Church in that country had effectively been eliminated by exile or imprisonment. Pope Pius XI took the decision to attempt the establishment of a provisional hierarchy without the knowledge, still less the approval, of the Soviet government.Stehle, p.84 The Pope's plans were set down in the rescript Plenitudine Potestatis and the decree Quo aptius,Christopher Lawrence Zugger (2001) The Forgotten: Catholics of the Soviet Empire from Lenin Through Stalin. Syracuse University Press. p. 229 and involved the establishment of Apostolic Administrators in metropolitan centres, to replace the diocesan structures that had existed in Tsarist times. D'Herbigny was selected as the man to lead this attempt, and on 26 March 1926, en route to Moscow under the pretext of an Easter pastoral visit to western European Catholics resident in the Soviet capital, he received episcopal ordination in secret and behind closed doors from Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII), the Papal Nuncio in Berlin.Manfred Barthel (1984) The Jesuits: History and Legend of the Society of Jesus. William Morrow. p. 257 In Moscow, d'Herbigny conferred episcopal orders on Pie Eug√®ne Neveu, A.A., until then the pastor of the Catholic community in the mining town of Makiivka in Ukraine, and installed him as pastor of the church of St. Louis des Fran√ßais in Moscow, with the clandestine role of Apostolic Administrator for the Catholic Church in the Moscow region (of the historic archdiocese of Mogilev). Later in the same tour, d'Herbigny also consecrated Aleksander Frison and Boƒºeslavs SloskƒÅns and appointed them to similar roles, in Odessa and Mogilev respectively. He also consecrated Antoni Malecki and appointed him to a similar role in Leningrad. Further missions to the Soviet Union, and further appointments, followed. At the end of 1932, d'Herbigny was seriously compromised by the scandal created by Alexander Deubner, Russian priest and nephew of Clara Zetkin, the famous Communist and one of Moscow's international agents. D'Herbigny had hired him as a translator, and this unbalanced priest was even officially the co-author of the last book that he had just published. Having left precipitously in November 1932 for Berlin, for reasons that were not very honourable, Deubner was denounced as a Soviet spy. Downfall and isolation Within little more than a decade, all those appointed in secret by Bishop d'Herbigny had been imprisoned, exiled or executed, and the Vatican's policy of attempting to organise the church in Russia by means of clandestine appointments was abandoned. D'Herbigny was stripped of his powers and silenced, in circumstances which historians have not been able to clarify.Stehle, p. 177 French papal historian Yves Chiron gives a number of possible reasons: an internal settlement of affairs within the Jesuit order; jealousy of his privileged relations with Pius XI on the part of his Polish Jesuit superior general, Wlodimir Led√≥chowski; an affair with a woman; Russian provocation in revenge for his antics; general failure of his policies and tactics.Yves Chiron (2004) Pie XI: 1857-1939. Perrin. p. 191 In 1937, d'Herbigny was forced to abdicate his episcopal dignities and forbidden from any public activity whatsoever.Chiron, p. 191 Episcopal title D'Herbigny was appointed titular bishop of Ilium by Pope Pius XI in 1926. Ilium is Latin for Troy; D'Herbigny's mission to the USSR has been likened to the story of the Trojan Horse.Stehle, p. 87 See also * Edmund A.

Early life Struger was born in 1931 in Unterloibl. This is a town in the municipality of Ferlach in Carinthia of Austria. He moved to the United States in the 1950s and lived in the Cleveland area most of his life. Programmable logic controller PLC Control Panel Struger is sometimes known as the \\"father of the programmable logic controller\\" as is Dick Morley. Struger was involved in the invention of the Allen-Bradley programmable logic controller (PLC) during 1958 to 1960.Anzovin, p. 100, item # 2189. Programmable logic controller was invented by the Austrian-born American engineer Odo J. Struger in 1958-60 at the Allen-Bradley company in Milwaukee, WI, USA. A programmable logic controller, or PLC, is a simple electronic device that allows precise numerical control of machinery. It is widely used to control everything from washing machines to roller coaster to automated manufacturing equipment. Struger is often called the father of Allen-Bradley's programmable logic controller (\\"PLC\\") and credited with creating that acronym. The abbreviation \\"PLC\\" and the term \\"Programmable Logic Controller\\" are registered trademarks of the Allen-Bradley Company. Rockwell (Allen-Bradley) became the programmable logic controller device leader in the United States during the tenure of Struger. This is a device that is part of computers used today in nearly every machine automated factory worldwide. It is an electronic device that allows precise numerical control of machinery. It makes possible modern factory automation, as well as heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, plastic injection molding machines, commercial washing machines, and amusement park rides. It is even found in lavish stage effects of Broadway productions. The devices are designed to work in real time, taking in information, processing it and producing commands to control a mechanical process as it happens. The Programmable Logic Controller (\\"PLC\\") came about as a replacement for automatic control systems that used tens and hundreds (maybe even thousands) of relays, motor driven cam timers, and rotary sequencers. Murray Slovick (Spectrum editor, a magazine of the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers) has been reported as saying, William Little (Rockwell Automation chief technical officer) quoted to reporters, Struger based his computer technology on a concept developed in his doctoral dissertation at the Vienna University of Technology titled, The Process for Quantitative Handling of Positioning Errors of Numerical Control Machines. He obtained a doctorate degree in 1970 at the Vienna University of Technology from this thesis. The device Struger invented is essentially a rugged industrial computer that controls machinery. It is in most machine factories throughout the world today, especially those of high technology. The programmable logic controller computer technology is now a billion-dollar-a- year industry. Career Struger left the Vienna University of Technology in 1956 for a job at Brown, Boveri & Cie, a Swiss power company. In 1958 he became a research engineer at Allen-Bradley in Milwaukee. Here he headed a team that developed the programmable logic controller. Struger later became a vice president for Allen-Bradley and held that position until he retired in 1998. He worked for the company for nearly 40 years. Struger played a leadership role in developing the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standard for PLCs and its international successor, IEC 61131. Struger patented means for detecting malfunction conditions at the inputs to a logic gate. One was for the \\"Fault Detecting and Fault Propagating Logic Gate.\\" That patent was U.S. Pat. No. 3,743,855 issued July 3, 1973. Another control circuit employing fault mode logic gates was U.S. Pat. No. 3,751,684, issued to Struger on August 7, 1973. Struger also received U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,820 for a similar electrical apparatus as well as U.S. Pat. No. 3,240,951. Struger also received Canadian patents. Struger has received and been involved with several other patents. Retirement and death Struger retired in 1997 as Allen-Bradley's vice president of technology. He died on December 8, 1998, in Cleveland, Ohio, at the age of 67 of thyroid cancer. His wife was Marlene. He had two sons, Andre, of Farmington Hills, Michigan., and Gregory, of Newbury, Ohio. He has a sister named Franziska Panger of Austria.

Protein aggregation is a biological phenomenon in which intrinsically disordered proteins or mis-folded proteins aggregate (i.e., accumulate and clump together) either intra- or extracellularly. Mis-folded protein aggregates are often correlated with diseases. In fact, protein aggregates have been implicated in a wide variety of disease known as amyloidoses, including ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion disease. After synthesis, proteins typically fold into a particular three-dimensional conformation that is the most thermodynamically favorable: their native state. This folding process is driven by the hydrophobic effect: a tendency for hydrophobic (water-fearing) portions of the protein to shield themselves from the hydrophilic (water-loving) environment of the cell by burying into the interior of the protein. Thus, the exterior of a protein is typically hydrophilic, whereas the interior is typically hydrophobic. Protein structures are stabilized by non-covalent interactions and disulfide bonds between two cysteine residues. The non-covalent interactions include ionic interactions and weak van der Waals interactions. Ionic interactions form between an anion and a cation and form salt bridges that help stabilize the protein. Van der Waals interactions include nonpolar interactions (i.e. London dispersion force) and polar interactions (i.e. hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole bond). These play an important role in a protein's secondary structure, such as forming an alpha helix or a beta sheet, and tertiary structure. Interactions between amino acid residues in a specific protein are very important in that protein's final structure. When there are changes in the non-covalent interactions, as may happen with a change in the amino acid sequence, the protein is susceptible to misfolding or unfolding. In these cases, if the cell does not assist the protein in re-folding, or degrade the unfolded protein, the unfolded/misfolded protein may aggregate, in which the exposed hydrophobic portions of the protein may interact with the exposed hydrophobic patches of other proteins. There are three main types of protein aggregates that may form: amorphous aggregates, oligomers, and amyloid fibrils. Causes Protein aggregation can occur due to a variety of causes. There are four classes that these causes can be categorized into, which are detailed below. = Mutations = Mutations that occur in the DNA sequence may or may not affect the amino acid sequence of the protein. When the sequence is affected, a different amino acid may change the interactions between the side chains that affect the folding of the protein. This can lead to exposed hydrophobic regions of the protein that aggregate with the same misfolded/unfolded protein or a different protein. In addition to mutations in the affected proteins themselves, protein aggregation could also be caused indirectly through mutations in proteins in regulatory pathways such as the refolding pathway (molecular chaperones) or the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (ubiquitin ligases). Chaperones help with protein refolding by providing a safe environment for the protein to fold. Ubiquitin ligases target proteins for degradation through ubiquitin modification. = Problems with protein synthesis = Protein aggregation can be caused by problems that occur during transcription or translation. During transcription, DNA is copied into mRNA, forming a strand of pre-mRNA that undergoes RNA processing to form mRNA. During translation, ribosomes and tRNA help translate the mRNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. If problems arise during either step, making an incorrect mRNA strand and/or an incorrect amino acid sequence, this can cause the protein to misfold, leading to protein aggregation. = Environmental stresses = Environmental stresses such as extreme temperatures and pH or oxidative stress can also lead to protein aggregation. One such disease is cryoglobulinemia. Extreme temperatures can weaken and destabilize the non- covalent interactions between the amino acid residues. pHs outside of the protein's pH range can change the protonation state of the amino acids, which can increase or decrease the non-covalent interactions. This can also lead to less stable interactions and result in protein unfolding. Oxidative stress can be caused by radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). These unstable radicals can attack the amino acid residues, leading to oxidation of side chains (e.g. aromatic side chains, methionine side chains) and/or cleavage of the polypeptide bonds. This can affect the non-covalent interactions that hold the protein together correctly, which can cause protein destabilization, and may cause the protein to unfold. = Aging = Cells have mechanisms that can refold or degrade protein aggregates. However, as cells age, these control mechanisms are weakened and the cell is less able to resolve the aggregates. The hypothesis that protein aggregation is a causative process in aging is testable now since some models of delayed aging are in hand. If the development of protein aggregates was an aging independent process, slowing down aging will show no effect on the rate of proteotoxicity over time. However, if aging is associated with decline in the activity of protective mechanisms against proteotoxicity, the slow aging models would show reduced aggregation and proteotoxicity. To address this problem several toxicity assays have been done in C. elegans. These studies indicated that reducing the activity of insulin/IGF signaling (IIS), a prominent aging regulatory pathway protects from neurodegeneration-linked toxic protein aggregation. The validity of this approach has been tested and confirmed in mammals as reducing the activity of the IGF-1 signaling pathway protected Alzheimer's model mice from the behavioral and biochemical impairments associated with the disease.  Aggregate localization  Several studies have shown that cellular responses to protein aggregation are well-regulated and organized. Protein aggregates localize to specific areas in the cell, and research has been done on these localizations in prokaryotes (E.coli) and eukaryotes (yeast, mammalian cells). = Bacteria = The aggregates in bacteria asymmetrically end up at one of the poles of the cell, the \\"older pole.\\" After the cell divides, the daughter cells with the older pole gets the protein aggregate and grows more slowly than daughter cells without the aggregate. This provides a natural selection mechanism for reducing protein aggregates in the bacterial population. = Yeast = 316x316px Most of the protein aggregates in yeast cells get refolded by molecular chaperones. However, some aggregates, such as the oxidatively damaged proteins or the proteins marked for degradation, cannot be refolded. Rather, there are two compartments that they can end up in. Protein aggregates can be localized at the Juxtanuclear quality-control compartment (JUNQ), which is near the nuclear membrane, or at the Insoluble Protein deposit (IPOD), near the vacuole in yeast cells. Protein aggregates localize at JUNQ when they are ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation. The aggregated and insoluble proteins localize at IPOD as a more permanent deposition. There is evidence that the proteins here may be removed by autophagy. These two pathways work together in that the proteins tend to come to the IPOD when the proteasome pathway is being overworked. = Mammalian cells = In mammalian cells, these protein aggregates are termed \\"aggresomes\\" and they are formed when the cell is diseased. This is because aggregates tend to form when there are heterologous proteins present in the cell, which can arise when the cell is mutated. The E3 ubiquitin ligase is able to recognize misfolded proteins and ubiquinate them. HDAC6 can then bind to the ubiquitin and the motor protein dynein to bring the marked aggregates to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). There, they pack together into a sphere that surrounds the MTOC. They bring over chaperones and proteasomes and activate autophagy.  Elimination  There are two main protein quality control systems in the cell that are responsible for eliminating protein aggregates. Misfolded proteins can get refolded by the bi-chaperone system or degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system or autophagy. = Refolding = The bi-chaperone system utilizes the Hsp70 (DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE in E. coli and Ssa1-Ydj1/Sis1-Sse1/Fe1 in yeast) and Hsp100 (ClpB in E. coli and Hsp104 in yeast) chaperones for protein disaggregation and refolding. Hsp70 interacts with the protein aggregates and recruits Hsp100. Hsp70 stabilizes an activated Hsp100. Hsp100 proteins have aromatic pore loops that are used for threading activity to disentangle single polypeptides. This threading activity can be initiated at the N-terminus, C-terminus or in the middle of the polypeptide. The polypeptide gets translocated through Hsp100 in a series of steps, utilizing an ATP at each step. The polypeptide unfolds and is then allowed to refold either by itself or with the help of heat shock proteins. = Degradation = Misfolded proteins can be eliminated through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). This consists of an E1-E2-E3 pathway that ubiquinates proteins to mark them for degradation. In eukaryotes, the proteins get degraded by the 26S proteasome. In mammalian cells, the E3 ligase, carboxy-terminal Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP), targets Hsp70-bound proteins. In yeast, the E3 ligases Doa10 and Hrd1 have similar functions on endoplasmic reticulum proteins. 554x554px Misfolded proteins can also be eliminated through autophagy, in which the protein aggregates are delivered to the lysosome. 283x283px Toxicity Although it has been thought that the mature protein aggregates themselves are toxic, recent evidence suggests that it is in fact immature protein aggregates that are most toxic. The hydrophobic patches of these aggregates can interact with other components of the cell and damage them. The hypotheses are that the toxicity of protein aggregates is related to mechanisms of the sequestration of cellular components, the generation of reactive oxygen species and the binding to specific receptors in the membrane or through the disruption of membranes. A quantitative assay has been used to determine that higher molecular weight species are responsible for the membrane permeation. It is known that protein aggregates in vitro can destabilize artificial phospholipid bilayers, leading to permeabilization of the membrane.

They connected the coal pits around Morda to transport networks, the first to the Montgomery Canal and the second to the Cambrian Railways at Whitehaven. History A horse-drawn tramway running southeast was built in 1813 to serve the small coal mines of Coed-y-Go and the Bell Pits near Morda, Has maps and pictures about 1 mile south of Oswestry. It ran east of Sweeney Mountain, crossed the Oswestry-Welshpool road at Albridge Lane, and met the Montgomery Canal at a wharf by Gorwen Bridge south of Maesbury, where the canal now ends. When the large Drill colliery opened, the tramway was modernised with new rails that could handle heavier loads. By 1850 the canal had been taken over by the Shropshire Union Canal and the tramway had closed by 1879. Railway engineer Thomas SavinBaughan 1980, page 180 saw the advantage of connecting his Cambrian Railways to the mines at Morda. He bought the Coed y Go mines and built a narrow-gauge railway from Whitehaven, starting near Nuttree Farm. Has maps and pictures of Savin's railway It ran northwards, west of Sweeney Mountain to Gorwen, then curved west up the brook through Brook House and then swung northeast to Coed-y-Go. The railway opened in 1861 but Savin's railways collapsed in 1866 and his mine closed in 1869. Remains Most of Savin's railway can be traced today. There is a fine bridge at Brook House, that has a high arch to accommodate the tall chimneys of the locomotives used on the line. It seems that there was an existing bridge taking the lane over Nant-y-Caws brook, now referred to as the Garden Bridge. Savin built a new bridge to take the lane over both railway and brook, and realigned the lane over the new bridge. Limestone blocks that supported the track can be seen in the field east of the bridge.

Originally envisioned as an expansion of Wynn Las Vegas, Encore Las Vegas quickly became a full-scale resort; it shares resources and is connected to the Wynn resort via a shopping esplanade. The resort was estimated to add 5,300 jobs to the Las Vegas area.Christopher Reynolds, Steve Wynn's Encore steals the show on the Strip, Los Angeles Times, December 23, 2008, Accessed January 6, 2008 After 2¬Ω years of construction, the resort formally opened to the public at 8:00 pm on December 22, 2008, to large crowds.Arnold M. Knightly, WYNN RESORTS: Enter the Encore, Las Vegas Review- Journal, December 23, 2008, Accessed January 6, 2008 Due to the period's economic downturn, the opening was designed to be more subdued than previous casino resort openings.Richard Abowitz, Steve Wynn's Encore , LATimes.com, December 22, 2008, Accessed January 6, 2008 The resort's jewelry shop featured the , prune-sized Wynn Diamond, billed as \\"the largest cut pear-shaped diamond in the world\\". To open the betting, Steve Wynn gave high-rollers a few million dollars to make the initial bets and initiated the action by declaring over a microphone, \\"Let the games begin!\\"; the start of gambling was accompanied by a recording of Frank Sinatra's \\"Luck Be a Lady Tonight.\\" The Wynn Plaza shopping complex opened in 2018. The shopping complex moves the Wynn properties closer to Las Vegas Boulevard. A new sportsbook was unveiled in August 2017. Design The resort features a casino, of convention space, of retail space in \\"The Esplanade\\", a spa and salon, four restaurants, two bars, a nightclub and a Beach Club. The building is in height and in width, and has 63 floors, making it three floors higher than Wynn Las Vegas, though the building actually contains 49 floors since floor numbers 2, 3, 4, 13 and 40‚Äì49 were omitted: 13 has traditionally been an unlucky number in various Western cultures, and various East Asian cultures are superstitious about the number 4 because it is a homonym for \\"death\\" in those languages. The resort's interior public spaces feature a combination of European and Asian influences and whimsical designs, including strong reds and a butterfly motif, in its design; the overall theme was designed by Roger Thomas. In addition, the hotel continues and expands on the original Wynn Resort's use of large scenic windows, dense greenery and filtered natural light to pervade more areas of the casino than had traditionally been done in Las Vegas. The pool area includes 29 rentable cabanas. In late November 2009, the casino was slightly altered, removing drapery and palm trees in an effort to open up the space a bit more.

It is the parish church of the previously separate village of Rottingdean, which became part of the former Borough of Brighton in 1928. Parts of the structure date from the 13th century, and it is a Grade II* listed building. History The church is in the northeastern corner of the Green, the ancient heart of the village. A place of worship has stood in the position since the Saxon period, although there is disagreement over whether any part of the current structure is of Saxon origin. The Normans started building a cruciform church in the early 12th century, but its tower (located on the site of the Saxon building's chancel) collapsed during construction, destroying the new chancel and the transept, although the nave survived. By the early 13th century the chancel had been rebuilt and the nave extended by four bays. These were added to the south aisle, but this fell out of use after 1377 when the church and surrounding buildings were sacked by French invaders who had landed on the coast nearby. Damage to the west wall necessitated rebuilding at the same time, and the south aisle was blocked up. The church remained structurally unaltered until a major restoration in 1856 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. A new three-bay south aisle was built; Scott removed an ancient window from the original aisle and built it into one of the new walls. The chancel wall was also partly rebuilt at this time. Earlier in the 19th century, box pews and a gallery were added; Scott removed the gallery during his restoration. Burne-Jones Additions in the 20th century comprised a porch at the west entrance, erected in 1908, and vestries in one corner of the nave, added in the 1970s in a style appropriate to the mediaeval architectural style of the church. This was designed by the Brighton-based architecture firm Denman & Son. A new gallery, at the west end of the nave and accommodating the organ, was also built in 1908; the original gallery had been on the south side. The bowl of the original Norman font was discovered in the vicarage garden; a replica was made in 1910, and the original bowl was displayed in the church. Lucy Ridsdale, daughter of Edward Ridsdale of The Dene, a house on the village green, married Stanley Baldwin in the church in 1892. He later served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on three occasions. The Baldwins donated a chair to the church in 1942; this stands in the chancel. Sir Edward Burne-Jones, who designed many of the stained glass windows in the church, lived at a house on the village green for 18 years until his death in 1898. He was the uncle of author and poet Rudyard Kipling, who moved to a nearby house (The Elms) in 1897. Kipling wrote many of the Just So Stories during his time there. In the early 20th century, a proposal was received from the developers of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, a private cemetery in Glendale, California. They wanted to buy the church, dismantle it stone by stone, ship it to the United States and rebuild it in the park. A price was offered, but the sale was refused, so in the 1940s a series of drawings were made, and an exact replica was built instead. This was called the Church of the Recessional to commemorate Kipling's poem \\"Recessional\\". Architecture The west end and entrance The church is built of flint, with stone dressings and a tiled roof. Although the 19th-century work by Scott also used flint, its pattern is more even than the random distribution seen in the original walls. The entrance is at the west end, opposite the village green, and reached through a lychgate dating from 1897 in memory of Revd Arthur Thomas, vicar of the church for 47 years until his death in 1895. (Two windows in the square tower are also memorials to him.) The entrance door is flanked by two heavy buttresses. On top of the steeply pitched roof at the west end is a small cross, and a large clock is embedded in the wall below this. The main structures of the nave, chancel and tower are all original. There are a series of trefoil and lancet windows on all sides, many of which are paired. Many of these have stained glass; most were designed by Edward Burne-Jones. In particular, the east wall has three tall lancet windows and a quatrefoil; the lancet windows, installed in 1893 in commemoration of Burne-Jones's daughter Margaret's marriage, represent the archangels Gabriel, Michael and Raphael. The church today St Margaret's was listed at Grade II* on 13 October 1952. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. It remains in active use for worship, and is the only Anglican church in the Benefice of Rottingdean. The parish covers the whole of Rottingdean‚Äîreaching to the boundaries of Ovingdean and Saltdean‚Äîthe coast road as far as Roedean, and surrounding areas of downland. Services are held in the church on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays for the parish, and on Wednesdays for pupils at St Margaret's Church of England Primary School. Sermons are available to download as podcasts. Burials and memorials  Sir Edward Burne-Jones, Pre-Raphaelite artist and designer, is buried in the nave. His wife Georgiana, one of the MacDonald sisters, and their granddaughter, novelist Angela Thirkell, are also buried there. The ancient churchyard, extended in 1883, 1905 (with land donated by William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny) and 1920, includes the graves of Scottish novelist William Black, and the blues guitarist Gary Moore.

Seals was the Democratic nominee in three campaigns to become U.S. Representative for . In 2006 and 2008, he was defeated by the incumbent Mark Kirk. In his third run, he was defeated by Republican candidate Robert Dold, on November 2, 2010, after Kirk vacated the seat to successfully run for the U.S. Senate.  Early life, education and career  Daniel Joseph Seals was born on June 19, 1971 in Chicago, Illinois to George Seals, a former Chicago Bears football player, and a social worker. Both of his parents are of mixed-raced ancestry. His parents divorced and Seals was primarily raised by his mother in Hyde Park. He graduated from Kenwood Academy High School in 1989. He holds a bachelor's degree in Journalism from Boston University, a master's degree in International Economics and Japanese Studies from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and an MBA from the University of Chicago. He and his wife Mia live in Wilmette with their three daughters. After receiving his bachelor's degree Seals taught English in Japan from 1993 to 1995. From 1997 to 1998 he was a Presidential Management Intern (PMI), working as an aide to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and as an aide to Senator Joe Lieberman. He worked in marketing at Sprint from 2001 to 2003 and was Director of Marketing with General Electric Commercial Finance from 2003 until he took a leave of absence to run for Congress in 2005. In 2009, Seals did consulting work for Civic Consulting Alliance and The Point, an online service that helps charities and public campaigns with fundraising. He also served as a lecturer at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. In 2011, Seals was appointed by Illinois Governor Pat Quinn to be Assistant Director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. Campaigns for Congress 2006 = Seals ran against Winnetka attorney and former Park Board Commissioner Zane Smith for the Democratic nomination in the 10th Congressional district. Smith highlighted Seals' lack of experience in prior elected office and his location outside the 10th district boundary. Ultimately the better financed Seals prevailed, winning 71% to 29%. Following his primary win Seals faced three-term incumbent Congressman Mark Kirk. He focused on popular dissatisfaction with the Iraq war and the scandals plaguing several Republican members of Congress. He also attempted to tie Kirk to national Republicans, claiming that he voted with the Republican majority 80% of the time. Kirk focused on local issues and argued that he broke from the Republican Party on several issues such as gun control, stem cell research and abortion. Seals came closer than the Democratic candidates in 2002 and 2004, but ultimately lost to Kirk 53% to 47%. After his 2006 loss to Kirk, Seals listed his occupation as \\"business consultant\\". He also taught a course in public policy at Northwestern University school for continuing education in the spring of 2008. = 2008 = Seals announced in June 2007 that he would be running for Congress in the 10th district again. In the primary election he faced Jay Footlik, a former Clinton administration official. Seals was endorsed by U.S. Senator Dick Durbin. Footlik raised the residency issue again during a Chicago Tribune editorial board interview, to which Seals replied: \\"If I was a millionaire I could certainly just pick up and buy a new home, [but] I'm not a millionaire, and if you want more millionaires in Congress, I'm not your man.\\" The United States Constitution requires that candidates for Congress be residents of the state from which they are elected, but does not require district residency. Seals' home lies 0.3 miles outside of the 10th district, in the 9th which is represented by Jan Schakowsky. Footlik contended that Seals didn't deserve another chance because he lost to Kirk by six points in a good Democratic year, while Seals argued he had superior name recognition. On February 5, 2008 Seals won the primary with 81% of the vote. Kirk and Seals both raised large sums of money. The race was considered one of the most competitive in the country; Illinois Senator Barack Obama was the Democratic nominee for president and was expected to carry the district easily.https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/November-2008/The-Obama- Bounce/ In the general election, Seals once again lost to Kirk 53% to 47%, despite Obama winning the district by over 20 points. Following the 2008 general election, it was reported that Seals was being considered by Illinois Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn to replace Obama in the United States Senate if Governor Rod Blagojevich were to be removed from office. However, Blagojevich made the appointment, and chose former State Attorney General Roland Burris. = 2010 = In July 2009, Seals announced that he would be running a third time for . Kirk chose to retire in order to run for Obama's seat in the U.S. Senate. Seals narrowly defeated state representative Julie Hamos in the Democratic primary, and faced Republican businessman Bob Dold in the general election. Seals was endorsed for the General Election campaign by the Joint Action Committee (JACPAC) which supports a strong US-Israel relationship; pro- choice organizations NARAL and Planned Parenthood; environmental organizations Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters; and labor unions including Illinois Federation of Teachers, Associated Fire Fighters of Illinois, SEIU, UAW Region 4, Illinois AFL-CIO and Communications Workers of District 4. Kirk had been endorsed by the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters and Planned Parenthood in 2006 and 2008. In October, Seals was endorsed by the Chicago Sun-Times and suburban newspapers the Daily Herald, Lake County News- Sun, and Pioneer Press Seals lost to Dold 51%-49%.

Background Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gauteng Premier David Makhura at the Gandhi monument, Constitution Hill, Johannesburg There is a major resident Indian community in South Africa. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (more commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi) had commenced his political-legal career in South Africa, experimenting with civil disobedience in the 1890s and 1900s, to improve the quality of living of the Indians living there. A statue to him was unveiled in Pietermaritzburg by Saurav Ganguly, the captain of the Indian national cricket team during the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Indians also contributed to the African National Congress's struggle against the Apartheid regime. The Indian government was an outspoken critic of the apartheid-era South African government, refusing to maintain diplomatic relations. India's support evoked goodwill in South Africa and other African countries. South African Minister for Human Settlement Lindiwe Sisulu during a visit to Delhi said \\"India is our closest ally in the Asian continent\\" also added \\"The purpose of this visit is a gesture from the South African government to thank its Indian counterpart for all the help and support it has extended in our struggle for liberation\\". Development of bilateral relations Both countries established diplomatic relations after the end of apartheid in 1994. South African leader Nelson Mandela was awarded the Mahatma Gandhi Peace Prize and Bharat Ratna by the Indian government. Both nations have also promoted sporting ties, with the Indian national cricket team and the South Africa national cricket team frequently exchanging visits and participating in cricket tournaments hosted by either country. Economic ties Bilateral trade grew exponentially from US$3 million in 1992‚Äì1993 to $4 billion in 2005‚Äì2006, and the two governments have targeted increasing bilateral trade to $12 billion by 2010. Gold bullion constitute one-third of India's imports from South Africa, while India polishes and processes diamonds from South African mines. South Africa has promoted signing a free trade agreement with India and the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), which includes Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland along with South Africa. Bharti Airtel was scheduled to acquire MTN to make one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, and also touted as step in South-South cooperation. The deal was, however, rejected by the South African government of Jacob Zuma on the grounds that MTN would not be as South African anymore amid concerns of dual-listing on the Indian and South African stock exchanges. Military ties India and South Africa have also developed military cooperation, trading arms and joint exercises and programs to train forces. Some analysts have argued that while there are some strategic commonalities between India and South Africa, this has not always translated into common perspectives. IBSA Indian PM Manmohan Singh with Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva and South African President Thabo Mbeki. On June 6, 2003 India and South Africa signed an agreement with Brazil, known as the Bras√≠lia Declaration, establishing \\"South-South\\" cooperation, based on the premise of the three nations being regional powers of South Asia, Southern Africa and South America. The declaration called for extensive tripartite cooperation on strategic, commercial and cultural affairs, development of a tripartite free trade agreement and a united front in negotiating with Western nations in the World Trade Organization (WTO), calling for reform of the U.N. Security Council and supporting each other's bid for permanent membership with veto rights. The IBSA Dialogue Forum was created to promote cooperation and consensus on issues of trade, poverty alleviation, intellectual property rights, social development, agriculture, climate change, culture, defence, education, energy, health-care, information society, science and technology, peaceful nuclear energy, tourism and transport. The fourth summit was held in Bras√≠lia. The three nations pledged to boost trilateral trade to US$15 billion by 2010.

The trip mechanism allows the inlet valve to be closed rapidly, giving a short, sharp cut-off. The valve itself can be a drop valve or a Corliss valve. Trip valve gear was applied to larger stationary engines. It was not used in transport applications,An exception was the very early London Steam Carriage (1803) which had a form of trip gear. as it was not suitable for high speed. The trip point of the valve mechanism, and therefore the cut-off, would be adjusted either manually or automatically by the governor. The valve is opened by the mechanical valve gear mechanism, and when the trip gear trigger releases the mechanism the valve is snapped closed, usually by a spring acting against a dashpot.  Advantages of a Trip Valve Gear  When using the Corliss and other trip valve gears, the possible advantages are: # By allowing the inlet- valves to open quickly, full boiler-pressure can be established in the cylinder early in the stroke. # Due to how quickly the inlet-valve closes, the area of the work-diagram is increased. This is due to a sharp corner at the cut-off point rather than a rounded curve. When a rounded curve is present here the pressure from wire-drawing is lowered gradually due to the gradual closure of the valve. # Due to this gear being created for engines designed to be regulated by varying admission, it has an advantage of making terminal pressure low. These engines secure this regulation without creating irregularities in exhaust functions due to them always having multiple-valve engines. # Adjusting these independent valves can be easy if variations at both ends of the cylinder is something that is wanted. # Due to the small amount of motion and period of rest for the steam-valves after they have closed helps to reduce the friction in the valve-gear which in turn decreases the loss of power.  Disadvantages of a Trip Valve Gear  The trip valve- gear, which is almost always a multiple valve-gear, has the potential to face the following disadvantages: # Many times, these gears have multiple complicated parts. # Engines which are created with these complicated gears can be expensive. # The limitation of rotative speed or the number of revolutions which are caused by the need for engaging catches and valves can be a down fall in these valve-gears. # It is important for this valve to release prior to the valve reaching its greatest point of opening. This is an issue due to the way it limits the range.

The building was originally expected to rise . Construction of the building was to begin in 2007 and was expected to be completed in 2010. The construction of this building was proposed in 2003, though, it was never approved by the state of Maryland. In 2006, the construction of the building was again proposed, and finally approved by the state of Maryland. The building is being built where the Hearst Production Building once stood. Plans are now scaled back to 40 stories and 300,000 square feet of office space, in addition to a 270-room hotel. 300 East Pratt Street is located in Baltimore, MD between Commerce and South streets, housed the former Baltimore News-American building. It has been vacant and used for a parking lot for decades. However, parking lot owner InterPark LLC purchased the site in August 2013 after a redevelopment plan proposed by Urban America LP in 2006 fell apart during the recession. History The property, which has been used as a parking lot since the News American building was razed in 1990. The property has gone through two previous owners, and plans were floated for offices, hotels and condominiums but never realized. Then in 2013, InterPark, a Chicago-based developer and parking garage operator, bought the site for $16.4 million and requested bids from developers. Chicago-based InterPark Holdings tapped Comstock Partners in 2014 as a development partner on the project, and Comstock started working with the firm. However, Comstock stepped away from the project around the beginning of that year. The project was expected to break ground in 2016. Construction/ Architecture The constructions include feature sleek cladding of this millennium and tall, slender proportions that will drastically improve Baltimore's skyline. At 48 stories respectively, 300 E. Pratt will likely rise over 500 feet. The proposal for 300 E. Pratt St. from InterPark LLC and Comstock Partners calls for a building that would rise at least 38 stories, or about 425 feet, making it among the tallest in the city. It would include a hotel with 200 rooms, about 400 apartments, at least 500 parking spaces and up to 20,000 square feet of retail space. The apartments will be a mix of one, two and three-bedroom units and will have their own lobby, separate from the hotel. However, there were some concerns from the panel members that the building ‚Äî which as designed would devote much of its first floor to parking, service and mechanical uses with retail on Pratt Street ‚Äî could contribute to the disconnect between the central business district and the Inner Harbor. In order to meet new flood-plain requirements that the building's entrances be 8 feet off the ground in case of flooding during a major storm, Comstock Partners had to shrink the project's footprint, sacrificing about 10,000 square feet of retail space. Designers made the steps lower, wider and terraced, leaving wide stoops that invite pedestrians to sit and look out on Pratt Street. Environment/ Setting 300 East Pratt Street is in downtown located between Commerce and South Streets near the heart of Baltimore, Inner Harbor. Goals * DEVELOPMENT GOALS ‚Ä¢ InterPark is seeking a development partner to build a mixed-use project on the last waterfront parcel in downtown Baltimore ‚Ä¢ InterPark goal is to partner with a first-class development firm to optimize the mixed-use potential at the site OPPORTUNITY ‚Ä¢ All development options will be considered including multi-family, retail, office, and hotel concepts ‚Ä¢ Site is zoned C-5-DC which allows for multi-family, office, retail, hotel or mixed-use development with zero height restrictions or set back requirements ‚Ä¢ Expansion of the site is available through purchase of front parcel owned by City.

It was the group's second single after signing with Motown Records (and their third overall) as well as their second, and last, single for the Tamla label, before moving to the Motown label.The Complete Motown Singles Vol 1: 1959-1961 [CD liner notes]. New York: Hip-O Select/Motown/Universal Records. OverviewRecording= This is not only one of the rare singles to feature Florence Ballard on lead, but the only one with her as the sole lead. The song talks of a woman who's worried that her man is more concerned with eating \\"buttered popcorn\\" than anything else, as he eats it \\"For breakfast, lunch and a dinner too\\" as well his health \\"Well it worries me so I don't know what to do\\" . In the group's early days all of its members got a chance to sing lead on stage and in the recording studio, with Ballard having the role of main lead singer on stage. However Berry Gordy felt that the vocals of Diane Ross had a better chance at the targeted cross-over audience, as Ross had the most pop-sounding voice of the group. 1 line for the verse \\"more butter\\" is for the all girls from the group: Florence: When I asked him what was happenin' in the world today. He said... Florence: A more butter; Florence and Mary: More butter; Florence, Mary and Barbara: More butter; Florence, Mary, Barbara and Diane: More. Despite the fact that Ballard's leads were deemed \\"too soulful\\", Buttered Popcorn was considered by Motown's Quality Control department to be the best song to be issued as the Supremes' second Motown single. However, Berry Gordy was determined that Ross should be the group's main lead and wanted the group's cover of The Miracles' \\"Who's Lovin' You\\" to be the single's A-side. In the end, Gordy and Quality Control compromised; the Ballard-led song would remain the single's A-side, but the single would be promoted as if it was a \\"double A-side\\" one. =Reception= Both sides of the single received a lot of airplay on local Detroit stations, but problems very quickly arose. The first version of the song was withdrawn because it was considered \\"too raw\\", and a smoother take was released. Gordy did little to promote the single's A-side, and, some time later, the label discovered that the song could be conceived to have a scandalous \\"double meaning\\", and switch to pushing the B-side alone before ceasing promotion of the single altogether. Neither sides of the single charted nationally, but were smash hits on several regional charts in parts of the country. The Supremes' next single, \\"Your Heart Belongs to Me\\", was led by Ross (now billed as Diana), and was their first to chart nationally (peaking at #95 in Billboard magazine). Afterwards the label decided to make Ross the group's primary (and later lone) lead singer, with Ballard and Wilson relegated to backup singers; though they sang lead on album tracks and on stage until 1966 and were given lead lines on singles until 1963. Fourth member Barbara Martin, meanwhile, left the group just before the release of (and after recording) the group's next single, leaving it a trio. Later in 1970, after both Ross and Ballard departed from the group, Wilson was again given leads on the group's singles.

Life Le Grice was born in Bury St. Edmunds to a clergyman father Charles Le Grice on 14 February 1773. Little is known of Le Grice's early life but he was enrolled in Christ's Hospital some time around 1780 where he became a friend of other famous students including Leigh Hunt, Charles Lamb, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His brother, Samuel Le Grice was also a classmate of Charles Lamb and was known to be a great comfort to Lamb after the murder of his mother at the hands of his sister Mary. Upon leaving Christ's Hospital as a Senior Grecian he passed on to Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1796 Charles Le Grice left London for Cornwall where he became a tutor to William John Godolphin (died 1815), a son of a wealthy widow, Mrs Nicholls (n√©e Usticke) who lived on the estate of Trereife House, near Penzance. In 1789 Le Grice was ordained and in 1799 he married Mary Nicholls (died 1821). They had a son Day Perry (1800 ‚Äì 19 March 1881) who succeeded him to the Trereife estate. After the death of both Mrs Nicholls and her son (of the first marriage), Le Grice became a wealthy man. Le Grice had no contact with Charles Lamb after 1796 until they met again in 1834, the years of Lamb's death. He was the first librarian of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall. Le Grice died at Trereife on 24 December 1858 and is buried at St Maddern's Church, Madron. Posterity Charles Le Grice left little to posterity except some squibs, some reminiscences of Lamb and Coleridge, and a translation of the Greek Author Longus. Instead Le Grice is mostly known through stories told by others. Lamb wrote some reflections on Le Grice in the essay Grace before Meat. Henry Crabb Robinson, probably the best diarist of the age, wrote more than once of Le Grice. One story records Le Grice during the meeting of a debaters society in which when asked to speak upon who was the greatest orator ‚Äì Pitt, Fox, or Burke, Le Grice replied \\"Sheridan.\\" Le Grice was described to E.V. Lucas by Lord Courtney as \\"a jocund rubicund little man much of Charles Lamb\`s height but plumper, full of pun and jokes, very genial, and in quality rather suggestive of one of Thomas Peacock\`s diviners than of a man steeped in theological rancour.\\" In 1838 Le Grice published reminiscences of Lamb and Coleridge in the Gentleman's Magazine. Lucas reflects that it is a pity that a man who could write with such discernment as this should have done so little. ReferencesFurther reading * Lucas, E, V. The Life of Charles Lamb.

It is a flexible surfacing material, so is resistant to cracking. The system is mixed on site and cold applied, using a high-quality clear resin binder to coat the aggregate particles prior to laying. Unlike resin-bonded surfacing, where a thin layer of resin is applied to the surface and then the aggregate scattered on top (which can then become loose over time and is impermeable), resin and aggregates are thoroughly mixed together prior to laying, ensuring that the aggregate is completely coated and so providing a totally bound surface. As a result, a resin-bound surface is more durable and requires less maintenance ‚Äì it needs to be swept or power washed at least twice a year, to avoid the buildup of detritus and prevent the growth of moss or algae. Resin-bound paving is a fully permeable paving solution which allows water to freely drain through the surface. Meeting the requirements of Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) standards, this helps to prevent standing water and largely eliminates surface water runoff. Resin-bound surfacing does not currently conform to any British standards apart from BS 8204-6:2008+A1:2010 Appendix B for slip resistance. Therefore, great care must be taken to research any company that is offering resin and aggregate services. The quality of the resin-bound surfacing is dependent on a variety of factors. The polyurethane resin should be sourced from a manufacturer who can demonstrate that they have BS EN 9001 quality management standards. All companies conforming to this will be able to provide documentation on request. The resin-bound aggregate mix will generally be a mix of natural aggregates that must be kiln dried to prevent moisture coming in contact with polyurethanes and causing discolouration and poor performance. The resin sourced should be a two-part, quality-controlled polyurethane or similar with the activator added during the manufacturing process to eradicate mistakes on site made by operatives who are not qualified chemists. Too much activator or too little can affect the performance of the product. The ratio of resin to aggregate should be at the optimal amount depending on the application and environment type, and stone type which should be dried mixed aggregate incorporating 5-8mm sizes to ensure that the aggregate gets sufficiently coated and also to meet the standard requirements when tested to BS 8204-6:2008+A1:2010 Appendix B for slip resistance. This ration is sufficient to install at a minimum depth of 15mm at a coverage rate of approximately 4.5m2 and is suitable for pedestrian traffic. For vehicular traffic of up to 7.5 tonne a minimum of 18mm is required. Although resin-bound paving is a slip-resistant permeable decorative paving system, it has the ability to last for many years if sourced and installed correctly. Natural aggregate mix blends tested to BS 8204-6:2008+A1:2010 Appendix B for slip resistance will, when installed correctly, provide a slip- resistant, permeable, decorative finish suitable for pedestrian and light vehicular traffic. Decorative coloured recycled glass and pigmented quartzes are suitable generally for visual purposes only, as they are susceptible to damage due to having low crush values, so will become damaged if walked on. Natural aggregate and recycled rubber blends are available from BS EN 14001 manufacturers and are suitable for pathways and nature walks where environmental benefits are required from the specifier. The resins available are predominantly polyurethanes. The usage of higher-quality polyurethane resins ensures greater flexural performance for external applications and the resin will not yellow in appearance when exposed to UV light, the presence also provides greater protection from UV degradation. Non light-stable polyurethanes, although strong in performance, are more suited to internal applications where they are not in direct sunlight. Internal resin-bound applications are generally known as stone carpet. Resin-bound systems incorporating 10 mm dried aggregates and larger sizes are generally used as tree surrounds known as tree pits. These are a cost-effective and practical alternative to metal tree grilles that are stolen for scrap value, are costly to purchase and harbour litter thus increasing maintenance costs for local authorities and tax payers. Tree pit systems work in a similar way to resin- bound surfacing systems only using larger aggregates to allow more water to permeate through to feed the trees they surround. Tree pit systems are generally installed at a depth of 40 mm to 50 mm, depending on the specification; they have a reduced ratio of 6% light stable polyurethane resin to 100 kg kiln dried aggregate.

Koto≈çsh≈´, winner of the May 2008 y≈´sh≈ç, receives the Emperor's Cup It is awarded in each of the six annual honbasho or official tournaments, to the wrestler who wins the most number of bouts. Y≈´sh≈ç are awarded in all six professional sumo divisions. The prize money for a top makuuchi division championship is currently 10 million yen, while for the lowest jonokuchi division the prize is 100,000 yen. A runner-up is referred to as a jun-y≈´sh≈ç. Perhaps surprisingly, considering that most of the interest in tournaments today revolves around who will win the y≈´sh≈ç, the concept of a prize for a wrestler's individual performance is a relatively recent one. Legendary wrestlers such as Tanikaze and Raiden are credited today with winning many championships, but they are all unofficial and are really nothing more than a \\"best tournament record.\\" The individual y≈´sh≈ç idea evolved gradually, from wrestlers simply picking up cash thrown into the ring by spectators after winning exciting matches (common in the Edo period), to wrestlers being given trophies and prizes from private sponsors for performances over an entire tournament (beginning in the Meiji period). Trophies were at first given only for undefeated records, but since draws, no decisions and absences were all possible outcomes, several wrestlers could be eligible and it did not necessarily go to the man with the most wins. In January 1900, the system recognised today began to take shape when the Osaka Mainichi Shinbun newspaper announced it would give a prize of a kesh≈ç-mawashi decorative apron for either an undefeated record or for the fewest losses, and in the event of a tie, the wrestler who had defeated the most high-ranking opponents would win the prize. Thus the principle of an individual champion was established. Takamiyama Torinosuke's victory in June 1909 was the first to be declared a y≈´sh≈ç, and the system was formally recognised by the Japan Sumo Association in 1926 when the Tokyo and Osaka organisations merged. From June 1909 to October 1931 and from January 1940 to July 1947, there was also a group competition called . The wrestlers were divided into two teams, East and West,There is still East and West designation today, but this is simply for convenience when ranking the wrestlers, and there is no group competition. and it was the team with the better overall score that was awarded a prize. Though as noted, all six divisions award a championship, the top division championship receives by far the most attention. Consequently, in addition to their prize money, top division y≈´sh≈ç winners receive the , first donated by Hirohito, an avid sumo fan, in 1925 as the . It was changed to its current name upon Hirohito's accession to the emperor's throne in December 1926. There is also a banner with the names of past winners. Both are presented by the chairman of the Sumo Association. There are also many prizes and trophies given by prefectural and foreign governments, as well as businesses. For several years the French President Jacques Chirac, a noted sumo fan, donated a trophy. The wrestler is given replicas of all the trophies to keep. In July 2010, and again in May 2011, neither the Emperor's Cup nor any other prizes were handed out, because of controversies over illegal betting and match- fixing respectively. However, in both cases the y≈´sh≈ç were still official and counted on the wrestlers' records. An unbeaten 15-0 score is known as zensh≈ç- y≈´sh≈ç and is fairly rare; most y≈´sh≈ç winning scores are either 14-1 or 13-2. The wrestler who has won the most top division y≈´sh≈ç is Hakuh≈ç with 44, followed by Taih≈ç with 32, and Chiyonofuji with 31. Futabayama won 12 y≈´sh≈ç in an era when only two tournaments were held each year. The first foreign wrestler to win the makuuchi division y≈´sh≈ç was the Hawaiian born Takamiyama Daigor≈ç in June 1972. There were no others until Konishiki Yasokichi won his first championship in November 1989. However, due to the unprecedented dominance of foreign wrestlers in recent years, led by the Mongolian yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´ and Hakuh≈ç, there were no Japanese-born winners between Tochiazuma Daisuke in January 2006 and Kotosh≈çgiku in January 2016. Playoffs *Any playoffs are indicated on individual wrestler articles' tournament records as one P for every other playoff challenger the wrestler faced in that tournament. Since 1947 a playoff system (kettei-sen) has been in place to determine the winner of the y≈´sh≈ç if two or more wrestlers finish with an identical score. Until then, the y≈´sh≈ç would go to whoever was the higher in rank, as it was presumed they had faced better quality opposition, but this caused controversy in 1928, when ≈çzeki Hitachiiwa was chosen over maegashira Misugiiso despite the fact that one of his wins had come by default. There was similar criticism when new maegashira Chiyonoyama was denied a championship in November 1945, despite winning all his matches. Playoffs with more than two wrestlers involved are fairly common in lower divisions, but have only happened a handful of times in the top division. A three way playoff occurred three times in the 1990s, with a four way playoff in March 1997 and a unique five way playoff in November 1996. In such cases lots are drawn to decide who fights first, and the first wrestler to win two consecutive bouts takes the y≈´sh≈ç. A playoff is the only occasion in which wrestlers from the same stable (or heya) and relatives can meet in tournament competition. The wrestlers who have taken part in the most top division playoffs are Takanohana II with ten (won five, lost five) and Hakuh≈ç with ten (won six, lost four). Chiyonofuji has the highest percentage of victories, with a perfect 6-0 playoff record.

He murdered for an unknown period of time and was a suspect in dozens of murders until his capture in 1910. Spared from the death penalty by a request for leniency by the jury, he was sentenced to life in prison at Walla Walla State Penitentiary where he died in 1927 from lobar pneumonia and erysipelas complicated by dementia paralytic caused by syphilis.  Occupation and murders Gohl was employed as a union official at the Sailors' Union of the Pacific. Before this he had been employed as a bartender after returning broke from the Yukon. Already an accomplished criminal, Gohl was suspected of being responsible for many of the large numbers of deceased migrant workers that were found washed up on shore during his tenure as a bartender, as well as a number of other crimes. In 1905, during the great waterfront strike Gohl was charged with \\"assembling men under arms\\" and is also alleged to have forcibly abducted non-union crewmen from the schooner Fearless for which he was fined $1,250 in the Superior Court.San Francisco Call August 23, 1906 reports that on a man from the Fearless was found drowned and that Gohl had led an armed party which taken two sailors from the Watson A West As a union official, Gohl used his reputation and intimidating size to discourage strikes and \\"recruit\\" new union members. The Union building proved to be a location that was ideal for his crimes, both in providing victims, and in concealing the evidence of their murders. Sailors arriving in the port of Aberdeen would usually visit the Sailor's Union building soon after disembarking. There they could collect their mail and, if they wished, set some money aside in savings. Gohl would usually be on duty, alone. Typically, Gohl would ask if the sailors had any family or friends in the area. Then he would turn the conversation to the topic of money and valuables. If the sailor was just passing through, and would not be missed by anyone in the area, and had more than a trivial amount of cash or valuables on hand, Gohl would choose him as his next victim. Gohl would kill most of his victims in the union building by shooting them. Then after relieving them of their money and valuables, he would dispose of them in the Wishkah River, which ran behind the building and into Grays Harbor. According to some reports, there was a chute which descended from a trapdoor in the building directly into the river. Other reports state that Gohl would use a small launch to murder his victims and dump the bodies directly in the harbor. Though suspected of being responsible for the large number of sailors who would disembark in Aberdeen and disappear,Los Angeles Herald May 3, 1910-Mayor Benn of Aberdeen in 1908 had heard of Gohl being responsible for the \\"Floater Fleet\\"; Benn had Police Chief Dean begin an investigation although it took over a year because of the scarcity of evidence for a prosecution nothing was done to stop him until an accomplice, John Klingenberg, was brought back to Aberdeen after trying to jump ship in Mexico to escape prosecution, or possibly to escape Gohl.  The Arrest  Klingenberg was able to testify to seeing Gohl alone with a sailor, Charles Hatberg/Hatteberg, whose body had recently been found in the harbor at Indian Creek February 2, 1910,\\"Murder by Wholesale\\" The Spokane Press February 3, 1910 .p.1 soon after his disappearance on December 21, 1909.

The ownership was traced to Gohl.\\"Slayer of Hadberg tells story of deed\\" The Newport Miner May 12, 1912 .p.3 The motive according to Klingburg's confession was that Gohl claimed Hatberg had told a \\"detective Miller\\" that Gohl had shot a cow the previous summer.\\"Confession of Klingenberg\\" Aberdeen Herald April 27, 1910 .p.2 Gohl had already been arrested in February 1910 for the Hatberg murder and was convicted of two counts of murder, though suspected of 41 or more,San Francisco Call April 7, 1910 attributes the number of victims as 50 to 60 found guilty May 12, 1910 and sentenced to life imprisonment and taken to the State Prison June 13, 1910. Besides Hatberg, the second count was for the murder of John Hoffman,Los Angeles Herald February 6, 1910 reports Hoffman had withdrawn $450.00 prior to his disappearance; Gohl was also reported to have taken Hatberg personal belongings from the Indian Creek Shack where the victim had lived a witness to the Hatberg murder who was shot and injured by Gohl on the night of the murder, and killed the next day by Klingenberg, for which Hoffman's killer was sentenced to 20 years.San Francisco Call October 16, 1910 Klingenberg was found guilty of manslaughter in Hatberg murder; the jury recommended leniency Hoffman had been killed December 23, 1909, after the Hatberg killing, and had been robbed of $400.00San Francisco Call April 7, 1910 reports it was Gohl who killed Hoffman and also disposed of in the Harbor near Indian Creek. In July 1910, a human skeleton was found in Indian Creek; however, it is not known whether these were the remains of Hoffman.\\"Sixty Murders traced to Gohl\\". The San Francisco Call, April 7, 1910.

He was unsuccessful, and on his return to Aberdeen he took on work as a bartender. During this time it is believed he may have been responsible for numerous murders.

While he is remembered as a tycoon in the age of laissez-faire, cut-throat capitalism, he nevertheless helped the economic development of his native state and the South in general. Early years John H. Inman was a member of one of the best-known families in Tennessee. His father was a merchant in the village of Dandridge, and owned a plantation nearby. The Inman children received a good common school education. John H. Inman supplemented his English education by reading extensively. He left school at fifteen years of age, and became a clerk in a Georgia bank of which his uncle was president. He proved so intelligent and efficient that within a year he was promoted to the position of assistant cashier. At the beginning of the Civil War he enlisted in the Confederate army although he was not yet eighteen years old. His father and relatives were impoverished by the war, and in September 1865, he went to New York City to seek his fortune. He obtained employment in a cotton house and was admitted to full partnership in the firm in 1868. In 1871 he founded the house of Inman, Swann and Co., in which he associated himself with his former partners. The business grew rapidly, and in a few years he amassed a fortune of several million dollars in the cotton trade, that came to be centered in New York City largely through his activity. Southern resources Inman made a careful study of Southern resources and wants, and determined to do what he could for the development of the South. In association with other businesspeople who relied on his judgment, he invested over $5 million in the enterprises of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, including the bituminous coal mines at Birmingham, Alabama, the blast furnaces in that city, and Bessemer Steel Works at Ensley City, near there. He induced the investment of over $100,000,000 in Southern enterprises, and became a director in companies that possessed more than 10,000 miles of railroad. For many years, Inman competed for control of the Tennessee Railroad Company with New York Republican boss Thomas C. Platt, who was represented between 1898 and 1891 by Company Chief Superintendent Judge Hiram Bond of New York, but Inman was ultimately successful. In 1883 Inman directed his attention to Southern railroads. He became a director in the East Tennessee. Virginia and Georgia system, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the Richmond and Danville Railroad, and the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. Inman was a director in the Fourth National Bank in New York, and took so much interest in its prosperity that he refused a directorship in a prominent railroad company because a clause in the latter's charter made it impossible for a director of the company to also be director of a National Bank. Inman said, in declining, that he would rather part with all railroad interests than to sever connection with the Board of Directors of the Fourth National Bank. Among Southern enterprises Inman was largely interested in the organization of the Southern Iron Company, controlling the charcoal iron industry of the South. This concern brought about the manufacture of steel at the Chattanooga plant. He also owned a big tract of coal land in the Sequatchie Valley of Tennessee, one of the large centers of coal and iron interests below the Ohio River. Since 1886 Inman invested in the Richmond Terminal system of railroads and was chosen President in 1889. He was one of a few owners of the South Atlantic and Ohio Railroad, running from Bristol, Tennessee to Big Stone Gap, Virginia. Among other corporations in which Inman was a director were the American Cotton Oil Company, the Home Insurance Company, Royal Insurance Company of Liverpool, the American Pig Iron Storage Warrant Company, the American Surety Company, and the Liberty Insurance Company. Inman was appointed a New York City Rapid Transit Commissioner in 1891 and held the office until his death. He was one of the committee of five to provide a plan to secure the necessary financial aid for the World's Fair at the time New York was endeavoring to secure that exposition. The other members of the committee were J. Pierpont Morgan, August Belmont, Samuel Babcock, and Cornelius Vanderbilt. Personal life Inman was married on 8 June 1870, to Margaret M. Coffin of Sweetwater, Monroe County, Tennessee, a granddaughter of Dr. Charles Coffin, the founder and for years the President of Greenville College. Together, they had six children and lived in New York City. He died on 5 November 1896 in his country house in Berkshire, Massachusetts. The city of Inman, South Carolina, is named for John H. Inman.

The route is . When the road was added to the state highway system in 1915 and numbered in 1927, it formed a connection from Ogden to Hooper. However, after a series of changes, SR-37 does not enter Ogden and extends further south to Sunset. Route description SR-37 begins at SR-126 (Main Street) in Sunset, just west of I-15, though the nearest access to the Interstate is more than a mile (1.5 km) away. It first heads west on 1800 North, passing through Clinton and West Point before turning north at 5000 West, which becomes 5900 West when it crosses from Davis County into Weber County. Beyond Hooper, SR-37 turns east onto 4000 South, which leads through West Haven and to the border with Roy at SR-108. SR-37 ends there, but the road continues to SR-126 at Ogden- Hinckley Airport, 3.5 miles (5.5 km) north of SR-37's south end.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed May 2008 via ACME Mapper The entire route is located in the flat plain between Ogden Bay (Great Salt Lake) in the Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch Range. The area was formerly served by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad's Hooper Branch from Roy. History The road from Ogden southwest to Hooper, via 24th Street, Midland Drive, 4000 South, and 5900 West, was added to the state highway system in 1915,Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated October 2007, accessed May 2008Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated October 2007, accessed May 2008 and assigned the SR-37 designation by the state legislature in 1927. The legislature added a connection from US-91 (now SR-26) at \\"Death Curve\\" in Roy north along 1900 West, Hinckley Drive, and Pennsylvania Avenue to SR-37 at Hooper Junction in 1923 and numbered it State Route 38 in 1927. The piece of SR-37 east of Hooper Junction, mostly on 24th Street, was transferred to SR-38 in 1931. That same year, State Route 105 was created, initially running from US-91 (now SR-126) in Sunset east to SR-49 (which by the mid-1930s was US-89) in South Weber. It was extended west from Sunset to South Hooper in 1933, and in 1941 the original portion east of Sunset, which now lies inside Hill Air Force Base, was deleted. SR-37 and SR-105 were connected in 1935 by SR-195, which connected to the former at Hooper, the latter at South Hooper, and continued south and east to SR-108 in Syracuse. A 1945 extension of SR-37 absorbed SR-105 and part of SR-195, creating the present three-quarter loop, though it was about three miles (5 km) longer than the present extent, due to the north end being at Hooper Junction. In 1953, the north-south piece of SR-38 on 1900 West (south of Nye's Corner, the intersection with Hinckley Drive) became an extension of SR-84 (now SR-126). Until 1964, SR-39 left downtown Ogden by heading east on 24th Street, north on Harrison Boulevard (now SR-203), and east on Valley Drive to Ogden Canyon. That year, it was moved to a new connection from 12th Street to the canyon. The portion on 24th Street became an extension of SR-37 to SR-203, which also replaced the easternmost portion of SR-38 between Hooper Junction and Washington Boulevard (US-89/US-91, now solely US-89). This left SR-38 as a short route on Hinckley Drive and Pennsylvania Avenue between SR-84 at Nye's Corner and SR-37 at Hooper Junction. With the construction of I-15, Pennsylvania Avenue was no longer useful as a state highway, and so it was given to the city of Ogden in 1966. The remainder of SR-38, on Hinckley Drive, became an extension of SR-79. The state legislature truncated SR-37 to its present length in 1969. The portion from Hooper Junction (where I-15 now crossed) to US-89/US-91 in Ogden became a new SR-53, the piece southwest of SR-84 became an extension of SR-108, and the roadways in between and east of US-89/US-91 were removed from the state highway system.

The armies being divided into units by the quality the warriors and birth.Birgir Loftsson, Herna√∞arsaga √çsland : 1170‚Äì1581, Pjaxi. Reykjav√≠k. 2006. pp.14‚Äì17 At the end of this period the number of chieftains had diminished and their power had grown to the detriment of their followers. This resulted in a long series of major feuds known as Age of the Sturlungs in the 13th century. During and before the war more than 21 fortresses were built.Birgir Loftsson, Herna√∞arsaga √çslands: 1170‚Äì1581, Pjaxi. Reykjav√≠k. 2006. p.76 The battle consisted of little less than 1000 men with the average casualty rate of 15%. This low casualty rate has been attributed to the blood- feud mentality that permeated Icelandic society, which meant that the defeated army could not be slaughtered honourably to a man. As well as the requirements of Christianity to get a pardon from a cleric for each fiend smitten, which resulted in only people of low class taking care of executions. While executions after battle were uncommon, they were extensive when they happened. See, for instance the battle of Haugsnes with about 110 fatalities, Fl√≥abardagi with about 80 fatalities on one side and unknown on the other and the battle of √ñrlygssta√∞ir with up to 60 fatalities including executions. These three battles, or skirmishes as they would be called in a European context add up to 250 fatalities, so these three encounters alone add up to almost 6 of the average killings of 7 per year in the period 1220‚Äì1262. Years could pass without killings. Amphibious operations were important part of warfare in Iceland in this time, especially in the Westfjords, while large naval engagements were not common. The largest of these was an engagement of a few dozen ships in H√∫nafl√≥i known as Fl√≥abardagi. One side employing smaller longships as well as boats and the other large Knaars, other larger merchant ships and ferries. Although neither side expected to do battle at sea, the battle was fought in a fairly standard way for the time, the ships being bound together, starting with archery and rock throwing, then spear hurling and ending in a melee all over the fleet, ships being exchanged by each side many times. At first the chieftains relied primarily on peasant levies but as the war progressed and Norwegian military influences became more pronounced, their personal retinues expanded and became more professional. At the end most of the chieftains had been slain and only one of the original chieftains who started the war remained. It had nonetheless become evident that no one chieftain was powerful enough to vanquish all the others and ensure peace. This led the Icelandic betri b√¶ndur (better farmers or farmer leaders) of the South, North and Western Iceland to submit to the Norwegian crown and the Al√æingi in 1262. Two years later in 1264 the Lords of Eastern Iceland, the Sv√≠nfellingar, submitted as well, but the Eastern Region had completely escaped the ravages of war, mostly because of its geographical barriers of wastelands, mountains and glaciers. Union with Norway King H√°kon V Peace barely ensued as the Norwegian King had little capacity to enforce his will over the Atlantic Ocean, his navy, although the most powerful Atlantic navy at the time was too small to carry big enough invasion force all the way to Iceland. The native Nobles continued to maintain their elite troops, which were called sveinali√∞ while the s√Ωslumenn (sheriffs), most of which were noble descendants of the chieftains, maintained soldiers or sveinar for the defence duties that had been delegated to them by law. All inhabitants of a s√Ωsluma√∞ur¬¥s fief were obligated to follow them in battle against invaders. The king rarely asked for expeditionary forces to help defend Norway, although Icelanders in Norway had been obligated to help Norwegian defences since the early 12th century. There are however a few documented occasions of Icelandic expeditionary armies coming to the king's aid. As the church became more powerful its bishops and priests became more militant: at the peak of their power the two bishops could command armies consisting of over 6% of Iceland's total population. The Bishops' own sveinar could expect to become priests after their military service. The two bishops became de facto Ecclesiastical Counts or Kirkjugreifar, responsible for law enforcement and overall command of military defences. Icelandic noblemen became wary of the Bishops' powers in the late 15th century and protested. During the 15th century, when English traders and fishermen started to come to Iceland, it became a common practice among chieftains to buy cannons for defence against foreign ships and for internal conflicts. Other firearms, such as the hand gonne, known as haki or hakbyssa in Iceland, became popular as well. Lutheranism The Atgeir (halberd). A signature weapon of Icelandic farmers since the late 16th century. 16th century Icelandic man-at-arms. Picture is to depict Eir√≠kr Rau√∞i, who is equipped somewhat anachronistically, from the 17th century book Groenlandia by Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson. Since the king of Denmark had embraced Lutheranism in the early 16th century he had campaigned to convert his realms from Catholicism to Lutheranism. In the 1540s it was Iceland's turn: Lutheran bishop was elected as the bishop of Sk√°lholt diocese and bitter conflict ensued. Although the bloodshed didn't come close to that in the Civil War fought in the 13th century it was still considerable as the bishops fielded armies of thousands, and even fought at Al√æingi. In a bid to isolate Sk√°lholt, Iceland's last Catholic bishop, J√≥n Arason of H√≥lar, attempted to cut its lines of communication to the Westfjords by invading the lands of Da√∞i Gu√∞mundsson. Although initially successful in capturing Sau√∞afell he was later defeated by Da√∞i's army and captured with his sons. J√≥n Arason and his sons were then transported to Sk√°lholt and beheaded there in 1550. A year later a Danish mercenary force mostly consisting of Landsknechts arrived to support the policy of conversion. Although no open warfare continued, the Danish king was still wary of an insurrection and ordered the destruction of all Icelandic arms and armor. Further mercenary armies, consisting of Landsknechts, are sent to carry out these orders over the following years. After that starts a period where Royal Danish forces are responsible for the defence of Iceland. The Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy patrols the coasts of Iceland, but mostly to prevent illegal trading rather than piracy. Some Icelandic sheriffs, however, manage to continue to maintain considerable retinues, especially in the Westfjords, where the Landsknechts were not as thorough in their search. Pirate raids The lack of weaponry among Icelanders made them more vulnerable to pirate attacks than before, although in some places, such as the aforementioned Westfjords, Icelanders managed to massacre foreign pirates. Icelandic officials complained about the raids in letters to the king and as a result many halberds were sent to Iceland by Royal edict. The halberd, known as atgeir or arngeir in Icelandic, became a signature weapon of Icelandic farmers. The king remained wary of the Icelanders, and refused to supply them with firearms. As most of the pirates were well armed with such weapons it made defence difficult. However some old guns and cannons still remained and could be used against their ships. In 1627 Icelanders were shocked at the inability of the Danish forces to protect them against Barbary corsairs who murdered and kidnapped a large number of people. In some places Danish troops fled from the raiders, but the Captain (H√∂fu√∞sma√∞ur) of Iceland, who was the highest-ranking military officer and overall governor of Iceland, managed to defend Bessasta√∞ir by hastily building fortifications and damaged one of the raiding ships severely with cannon fire. Some Icelanders were nonetheless angered that he didn't sink the ship despite it being stuck for 24 hours on a reef in front of the fortifications. As a result, Icelanders formed local militias with the king's blessing in places such as Vestmannaeyjar. 18th and 19th centuries 23px Icelandic Army Regimental Standard of the 19th century In the decades before the Napoleonic wars, the king declared his intention to send considerable amount of money to arm the Icelandic militias with muskets. However, his pledges were not fully fulfilled and in 1799 the few hundred militia-men in the South West of Iceland were mostly equipped with rusty and mostly obsolete Medieval weaponry, including 16th century halberds. When English raiders arrived in 1808, after sinking or capturing most of the Danish-Norwegian Navy in the Battle of Copenhagen, the amount of gunpowder in Iceland was so low that it prohibited all efforts of the governor of Iceland, Count Trampe, to provide any resistance. In 1855, the Icelandic Army was reestablished by Andreas August von Kohl the sheriff in Vestmannaeyjar. In 1856, the king provided 180 rixdollars to buy guns, and a further 200 rixdollars the following year. The sheriff became the Captain of the new army, which become known as Herfylkingin, \\"The Battalion.\\" In 1860, von Kohl died, and P√©tur Bjarnasen took over the command. Nine years later P√©tur Bjarnasen died before appointing a successor, and the army fell into disarray. Many have campaigned for an Icelandic standing army since the late 19th century, including Iceland's Independence hero J√≥n Sigur√∞sson,J√≥n Sigur√∞sson, \\"Um verzlun √° √çsland\\", N√Ω f√©lagsrit 3. pp. 116‚Äì117. but except for the attempt in 1940 it has amounted to little. Independence Agnar Kofoed Hansen training his officers in the art of war in 1940 In 1918 Iceland regained sovereignty as a separate Kingdom ruled by the Danish king. Iceland established a Coast Guard shortly after, but financial difficulties made establishing a standing army impossible. The government hoped that permanent neutrality would shield the country from invasions. But at the onset of the Second World War, the government, becoming justifiably nervous, decided to expand the capabilities of the National Police (R√≠kisl√∂greglan) and its reserves into a military unit. Chief Commissioner of Police Agnar Kofoed Hansen had been trained in the Danish Air Force and he moved swiftly to train his officers. Weapons and uniforms were acquired and near Laugarvatn they practiced rifle shooting and military tactics. Agnar barely managed to train his 60 officers before the United Kingdom invaded Iceland on May 10, 1940. The next step in the drive towards militarisation was to have been the training of the 300 strong reserve forces, but the invasion effectively stopped it. Cod Wars HMS Scylla and the Icelandic gunboat Odinn (1976) The Cod Wars, also called the Icelandic Cod Wars (Icelandic: √ûorskastr√≠√∞in, \\"the cod war\\", or Landhelgisstr√≠√∞in, \\"the war for the territorial waters\\"), were a series of three confrontations from the 1950s to the 1970s between the United Kingdom and Iceland over fishing rights in the North Atlantic. None of the Cod Wars meet any of the common thresholds for a conventional war, and they may more accurately be described as militarised interstate disputes. The First Cod War lasted from 1 September until 12 November 1958. It began as soon as a new Icelandic law that expanded the Icelandic fishery zone from , came into force at midnight of 1 September. After a number of rammings and a few shots fired between the Royal Navy and Icelandic patrol boats, Britain and Iceland came to a settlement, which stipulated that any future disagreement between Iceland and Britain in the matter of fishery zones would be sent to the International Court of Justice in the Hague. The First Cod War saw a total of 37 Royal Navy ships and 7,000 sailors protecting the fishing fleet from six Icelandic gunboats and their 100 coast guards. The Second Cod War between the United Kingdom and Iceland lasted from September 1972 until the signing of a temporary agreement in November 1973. In 1972, Iceland unilaterally declared an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending beyond its territorial waters, before announcing plans to reduce overfishing. It policed its quota system with the Icelandic Coast Guard, leading to a series of net-cutting incidents with British trawlers that fished the areas. As a result, the Royal Navy deployed warships and tugboats to act as a deterrent against any future harassment of British fishing crews by the Icelandic craft, resulting in direct confrontations between Icelandic patrol vessels and British warships, which again included ramming incidents. After a series of talks within NATO, British warships were recalled on 3 October 1973. An agreement was signed on 8 November which limited British fishing activities to certain areas inside the limit, resolving the dispute that time. The resolution was based on the premise that British trawlers would limit their annual catch to no more than 130,000 tons. This agreement expired in November 1975, and the third \\"Cod War\\" began. The Third Cod War lasted from November 1975 to June 1976. Iceland had declared that the ocean up to from its coast fell under Icelandic authority. The British government did not recognise this large increase to the exclusion zone, and as a result, there were again almost daily rammings between Icelandic patrol vessels and British trawlers, frigates and tugboats. The dispute eventually ended in 1976 after Iceland threatened to close a major NATO base in retaliation for Britain's deployment of naval vessels within the disputed limit. The British government conceded, and agreed that after 1 December 1976 British trawlers would not fish within the previously disputed area. NATO and the Cold War Iceland's main contribution to the NATO defence effort, during the Cold War was the rent-free provision of the \\"agreed areas\\"‚Äîsites for military facilities. By far the largest and most important of these was the NATO Naval Air Station Keflav√≠k, manned by American, Canadian, Danish, Norwegian and Dutch personnel. Units from these and other NATO countries also are deployed temporarily to Keflav√≠k, and they stage practice operations. Many of these practices were anti- submarine warfare patrols, but these exercises were halted when the P-3 ASW aircraft were withdrawn from Keflav√≠k. Iceland and the United States regarded the U.S. military presence since World War II as a cornerstone to bilateral foreign/security policy. The presence of the troops was negotiated under a treaty known as the Agreed Minute. Talks about the American presence were restarted as of 2005, since the U.S. government was keen on deploying its troops and equipment to parts of the world with more pressing need for them. Proposals by the Icelandic government included a complete Icelandic takeover of the Airbase, as well as replacing the Pavehawk rescue helicopter unit with a detachment from the aeronautical half of the Icelandic Coast Guard, in exchange for the continued stationing of the four F-15C interceptors in Keflav√≠k. On March 15, 2006 the U.S. government announced that the Iceland Defense Force would be withdrawn by the end of September 2006. The last American troops left on September 30, handing control of the Keflav√≠k base over to the Sheriff of Keflav√≠k airport, who was to be in charge of it on behalf of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. American withdrawal On September 26, 2006 the Government of Iceland released a document containing Iceland's response to the withdrawal of American forces.http://forsaetisraduneyti.is/media/frettir/Nyverkefni.pdf It included plans (a) to create a Security and Defense authority to oversee all security organisations in Iceland, including Police and Coast Guard; (b) to increase the capabilities of the Coast Guard by purchasing vessels and aircraft; (c) to create a Security or Secret service; and (d) to establish a secure communications system spanning the whole country. MP Magn√∫s √û√≥r Hafsteinsson of the Liberal party voiced his party's willingness to raise a standing army, in agreement with views expressed by Bj√∂rn Bjarnason Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical affairs. The Icelandic Defence Agency (Varnarm√°lastofnun √çslands) was founded in 2008 under the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Agency was to consolidate functions previously served by NATO forces at Naval Air Station Keflavik, such as maintaining defense installations, intelligence gathering and military exercises. An initial budget of $20 million fell to $13 million in 2009 as the Icelandic economy suffered a crisis. On 30 March 2010, the Icelandic government announced it would legislate to disband the Agency and put its services under the command of the Coast Guard or National Police. To save money and to restore the primary role of the Icelandic Coast Guard in defense, the Defence Agency was shut down on January 1, 2011. Iceland Air Meet 2014 hosted NATO and other Nordic countries for the first time.

Shanti Bahini launched an Insurgency against government forces in 1977, when the country was under military rule, and the conflict continued for twenty years until the government and the PCJSS signed the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord in 1997.Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs The actions then carried out by the Armed Forces and the Paramilitary forces of Bangladesh groups helping them were projected by tribals as genocide and ethnic cleansing. There were also reports of mass rapes by the paramilitary Bangladesh Ansars, though these have been disputed. According to Amnesty International as of June 2013 the Bangladeshi government made \\"praiseworthy progress\\" in implementing the terms of the peace accord and in addressing the Jumma people's concerns over the return of their land. Amnesty estimate that there are currently only 900 internally displaced Jumma families. Background The origin of the conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts dates back to the British rule. The British, at the end of the 19th century, reorganized the CHT. This resulted in the recognition of three tribal chiefs (rajas) in 1860, (b) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Frontier Police Regulations in 1881, authorizing a police force from among the hill peoples, and (c) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regulations in 1900, giving them rights and autonomy. When Bangladesh was the eastern wing of Pakistan, widespread resentment occurred over the displacement of as many as 100,000 of the native peoples due to the construction of the Kaptai Dam in 1962. The displaced did not receive compensation from the government and many thousands fled to India. After the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts who was the Chakma politician Manabendra Narayan Larma sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region. Larma and other Hill Tracts representatives protested the draft of the Constitution of Bangladesh. It did not recognise the ethnic identity and culture of the non-Bengali peoples of Bangladesh. The government policy recognised only the Bengali culture and the Bengali language, and designated all citizens of Bangladesh as Bengalis. In talks with a Chittagong Hill Tracts delegation led by Manabendra Narayan Larma, the country's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman expressed that the ethnic groups of the Hill Tracts as citizen of Bangladesh should have the Bengali identity which later was proven to be a false allegation. The migrated hill Jummas were given with special treatment, as they were the minority after independence in 1971. The rebellion by the Jumma began after the 1971 independence of Bangladesh. Insurgency Larma and others founded the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) as a united political organisation of all native peoples and tribes in 1973. The armed wing of the PCJSS, the Shanti Bahini was organised to resist government policies. The crisis aggravated during the emergency rule of Sheikh Mujib, who had banned all political parties other than his BAKSAL and the successive military regimes that followed after his assassination in 1975. In 1977, the Shanti Bahini launched their first attack on a Bangladesh Army convoy. It is alleged that the Indian government helped the Shanti Bahini set up bases across the border from Bangladesh. The Shanti Bahini divided its area of operations into zones and raised forces from the native people, who were formally trained. The Shanti Bahini attacked on Bengali Police and Soldiers, government offices, personnel and the other Bengalis in the region. The group also attacked any native believed to be opposing it and supporting the government. According to government sources between 1980 and 1991, 1,180 people were killed by the Shanti Bahini, and 582 were kidnapped.Human rights in the Chittagong Hill Tracts; February 2000; Amnesty International. 400 Chakmas including Anupam Chakma absconded to India to evade the Bangladesh Army in 1989.Though it was claimed to represent all tribes of Chittagong Hill Tracts, but in reality Chakmas dominated the Shanti Bahini. =Detention= Peoples living in the Hill Tracts area were often detained and tortured in the custody on suspicion of being members of the Shanti Bahini or helping the Shanti Bahini. There were numerous check posts on highways and ferries in Chittagong Hill Tracts. People who are detained on suspicion are subjected to severe beating, electrocution, water boarding, hanging upside down, shoving burning cigarettes on bodies etc. Prisoners are detained in pits and trenches. The captives are then taken out for interrogation once at a time. =Recent Developments= The accords of the peace treaty have yet to be fully implemented which has resulted in the region remaining heavily militarised and mass inward migration continuing. According to a report from the Asian Centre for Human Rights on 26 August 2003 the UPDF in conjunction with tribals planned and launched an attack on ten villages. Hundreds of people were displaced and it is estimated that ten women, some who were Jumma were raped. Government reaction A map of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. At the outbreak of the insurgency, the Government of Bangladesh deployed the army to begin counter-insurgency operations. The then-President of Bangladesh Ziaur Rahman created a Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust amongst the native people against the government. The government failed to address the long- standing issue of the displacement of people, numbering an estimated 100,000 caused by the construction of the Kaptai Dam in 1962. Displaced peoples did not receive compensation and more than 40,000 Chakma tribals had fled to India. In the 1980s, the government began settling Bengalis in the region, causing the eviction of many natives and a significant alteration of demographics. Having constituted only 11.6% of the regional population in 1974, the number of Bengalis grew by 1991 to constitute 48.5% of the regional population. In 1989, the government of then-president Hossain Mohammad Ershad passed the District Council Act created three tiers of local government councils to devolve powers and responsibilities to the representatives of the native peoples, but the councils were rejected and opposed by the PCJSS. Peace accord Peace negotiations were initiated after the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh in 1991, but little progress was made with the government of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of Ziaur Rahman and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Fresh rounds of talks began in 1996 with the newly elected prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed of the Awami League, the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

Description  Creation = The book, initially written in Marathi, was penned by Savarkar in response to celebrations in Britain of the 50th anniversary of the 1857 Indian uprising with records from India Office archives. The project received support from Indian nationalists in Britain, including the likes of Madame Cama, V.V.S. Iyer and M.P.T. Acharya, as well as Indian students who had dared not show their support or sympathy for India House openly. Published during Savarkar's stay in London at the India House, it sought to bring the Indian movement to public attention in Britain as well as to inspire nationalist revolution in India. = Inspiration = The book was influenced by histories of the French Revolution and the American Revolution. Additionally, Karl Marx had published a short article named \\"The Indian Revolt\\" in the New-York Tribune in 1857 and later went on to write the book \\"The First Indian War of Independence 1857-58\\" in the coming years. Savarkar published his book later in 1909, using much the same format as Marx's work. = Reception = The book, which describes the 1857 revolt as a unified and national uprising of India as a nation against British authority, was seen at the time as highly inflammatory, and the Marathi edition was banned in British India even before its publication. Publication of the English translation faltered after British printers and publishing houses were warned by the Home Office of its highly seditious content, while the British foreign office brought pressure on the French Government to prevent its publication from Paris. It was ultimately printed in the Netherlands in 1909, with the British government not tracing it until too late. The copies were printed with false dust wrappers purporting to be copies of The Pickwick Papers and other literary classics, and large quantities were shipped to India where it quickly became a bible of political extremists. It was excluded from the catalogue of the British Library to prevent Indian students from accessing it. In India, the book remained banned till the end of The Raj forty years later.  Legacy  The Indian War of Independence is considered to be an influential work in Indian history and nationalist writing, and also one of Savarkar's most influential works in developing and framing ideas of Hinduism. While some erstwhile and modern histories draw similar conclusions as the Savarkar, others, including R.C. Majumdar, disagreed with Savarkar's conclusions in his book on the national and unified character of the mutiny. ReferencesFurther reading *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

Temptations. Lanham, MD: Cooper Square. . Starting with the next single release, the group's future recordings for Motown would be issued under the Gordy label until it was deactivated in 1988. Recording This is one of the small handful of pre-psychedelic era songs the group recorded that had more than two members singing lead at one point (the second one recorded but the first released). Tenor Otis Williams leads the intro of the song, while the group's bass singer, Melvin Franklin, has a spoken interlude. Baritone Paul Williams, at the time the group's lead singer, leads the rest of the song as the song's narrator; the narrator talks about how after \\"breaking hearts\\" the tables have now turned on him as he‚Äôs losing his love and now \\"memories... are all I have\\". According to some sources, including Otis Williams autobiography falsetto Eddie Kendricks (and possibly Elbridge \\"Al\\" Bryant) did not record vocal on this single, and that the high notes of the song were done by Brian Holland and/or Eddie Holland. However, this cannot be substantiated by official Motown studio records. As for the label's deactivation, it was said to be due to poor sales (not helped by the slogan \\"If it‚Äôs a hit, it‚Äôs a Miracle\\") and confusion with The Miracles singing group. Reception The single was a regional hit around the Detroit area, receiving a lot of airplay on local stations, but it would never chart nationally. The group's next single, \\"Dream Come True\\", would be led by Kendricks, and would be their first to chart nationally. When that happened their new label would give Kendricks the lead on the group's A-sides, and regulate Paul Williams to B-sides, until 1963. About two years after this single was released, \\"The Duke of Earl\\" Gene Chandler would cover the song on one of his singles.

In 1875 Dr. J.C.Holm, a doctor and health resort pioneer, discovered a spring rich with minerals close to the river Farriselva.Fylkesarkivet i Vestfold, Larvik Bad og Kurhotell This led to the establishing of Larvik Bad (originally Laurvig Bad) in 1880, a spa resort where one of the treatments offered was drinking mineralized water.

B√∏keskogen is a forested hilltop which (along with the city of Larvik to the south of the hill) separates between Farris and the Skagerrak. Farris mineral water originates from rainwater falling on this hill. The water slowly filters through deposited glacial moraine material and reaches the spring some 15‚Äì20 years later, strongly mineralized.Farris fabrikker In 1988 a new spring, 21 meters deep, was discovered, and this new spring is the present source of the mineral water.

Located in the basin of the Galisteo River south of Santa Fe, it was home to a clan of the Tanoan peoples at the time of Spanish colonial contact in the 16th century. It was abandoned in the aftermath of the Spanish reconquest of the area after the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, its people believed to have eventually settled at First Mesa among the Hopi. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Description San Lazaro is one of a large number of archaeological sites in the Galisteo Basin, a region historically occupied by the Tanoan people. The San Lazaro complex is one of the largest in the valley, with an estimated two to five thousand chambers in several room blocks on the south side of the river. Other features of the site include kilns, a water diversion canal, and a hilltop shrine. The site is more than in size. It was excavated in the 1910s by Nels Nelsen. History The Galisteo River basin was first encountered by European explorers in the 1581-82 Chamuscado and Rodr√≠guez Expedition, in which the site now identified as San Lazaro has been associated by some researchers with the expedition's name \\"Malag√≥n\\". It was known to be occupied when Juan de O√±ate established the Spanish province of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico in the late 1590s. Its people were active participants in the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, occupying Santa Fe during the interregnum and suffering significant casualties during its recapture by the Spanish. Governor Diego de Vargas evicted them from their pueblo in 1695, resettling it with Mexicans. The people were first relocated to Pecos Pueblo, many of whose inhabitants are later thought to have migrated to the Tewa villages on the Hopi First Mesa.

Hillman, Humber and Singer models were assembled successfully for a number of years. The company also produced models which were hybrids of the three makes.

It ensures adherence to licensing requirements for investigators; organizes training and education; and represents the profession to the state and federal government and regulatory bodies, including the Texas Private Security Board and the Texas Department of Public Safety. TALI holds an annual convention and publishes a magazine, The Texas Investigator. TALI was founded in 1971. During the 1990s, it lobbied repeatedly to retain access to drivers‚Äô license and vehicle registration information. In the 2000s, it intervened to amend regulation of workers who access computer data. Since 2008, TALI has set up local chapters in each city and major rural area of the state, reporting to five regional directors. Founding Prior to State of Texas licensing, a governing board and a state law, the licensing and regulation of the profession was a mixed bag of local licensing by a few municipal and county governments. Because of the lack of consistent regulation among counties and cities, a group of five investigators met to discuss their ideas for the future. Their teamwork led to growth in the membership and resulted in the Texas Legislature passing Article 4413(29bb) V.A.C.S. in 1969. This act established the Texas Board of Private Investigators, private security agencies, and the accompanying state regulatory agency. However, one member hijacked the association for his own purposes. The effect was to sow dissent instead of camaraderie and to stall the forward momentum of the group. The budding association wound up going to court to preserve its name. In 1973, David Sallee, Ernest Humberson, Don Redding, and Ron Kelly revived the nearly lifeless association. These men knew that a statewide organization working for the good of all investigators could help all Texas investigators improve their professional image with the public. The founding investigators developed the first code of ethics and a set of by-laws for the association. The by-laws established a board of directors consisting of five positions: chairman, president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. In the early 1970s, TALI held its first annual meeting in Longview, Texas. By then there were twenty- five members. TALI‚Äôs annual conventions2008swsc.com have since grown in attendance to 650 investigators and other legal professionals. These meetings now offer investigative education, training, vendor product displays, and networking opportunities, which have begun to attract investigators from other states. History1980s and 1990s= In the late 1980s and early 1990s, TALI‚Äôs membership grew rapidly. The association became active in education, legislation, training, and working with the state legislature and regulatory agency. By 1991, TALI began developing more political strategies to better serve the profession and its needs. In 1991, the members lobbied the Texas Legislature and testified before House and Senate Committees to defeat two bills that would have eliminated access to drivers‚Äô license and vehicle registration information. TALI's leadership appointed a magazine editor and produced an improved quarterly publication for Texas investigators. In 1993, bills were again introduced in the legislature to deny investigators access to driver's license and vehicle registration. TALI members appeared before House and Senate Committees to testify against these bills, with success. The same year, an anti-stalking bill was introduced that would have eliminated Texas investigators' abilities to perform routine surveillances. TALI met with sponsors of the bill and were able to get it changed so that investigators could continue to perform surveillance. In 1995, TALI joined a state representative to sponsor an overhaul of Article 4413 (29bb) V.A.C.S. TALI held its first legislative walk-through day with 100 members present. The legislative efforts resulted in the mandating of continuing education, increase in penalties for unlicensed companies from a class A misdemeanor to a 3rd degree felony for a second offense, and established a definition of a full-time peace officer in Texas. TALI representatives helped in writing the present Texas law governing the use of tracking devices and getting it passed into law. TALI hired its first paid magazine editor and published the first edition of The Texas Investigator. In 1996, TALI became involved in federal legislation, along with the National Council of Investigation and Security Services (NCISS). The joint venture resulted in the first federal law recognizing the private investigative profession: the Drivers Privacy Protection Act. The act also allowed state licensed private investigators access to vehicle registration information. The Texas Sunset Commission began hearings to review the Texas Board of Private Investigators and Private Security Agency. TALI worked with the commission and testified before hearings regarding the restructure and naming of the agency. In 1997, TALI again worked in the Texas Legislature to keep public records open to the public. It was successful in getting the Drivers Privacy Protection Act] passed, which allowed state of Texas private investigators access to drivers license and vehicle registration information. In 1998 and 1999, TALI was again at the forefront in working for open records on both the national and state levels. In the 1999 session the Texas Legislature renamed the Texas Board of Private Investigators and Private Security Agencies to the Texas Commission on Private Security. =2000 to present= In 2001, TALI and its members appeared before the Texas Legislative Committees, fighting for Texas Open Records and the continuing survival of the regulatory agency. In this session the legislature moved the Private Security Board employees and budget under the control of the Texas Department of Public Safety for oversight. The number of employees were reduced to eight, including the executive director. The Private Security Board remained freestanding and separate from the Department of Public Safety. By 2003, TALI initiatives with the Texas legislature had resulted in the establishment of the Private Security Bureau within the Texas Department of Public Safety. Approximately 28 state troopers and supervisors were assigned to the Private Security Bureau under the direction of a DPS captain. Their primary function was to enforce Article 1702 of the Occupations Code and the rules established by the Private Security Board. In 2005, TALI assisted with the Texas Department of Public Safety‚Äôs request for additional funding for the Private Security Bureau. By a vote of the membership, the TALI board of directors was increased to include the formerly appointed regional directors. There was a major re-write of the by-laws that resulted in new leadership joining the board of directors. In 2006, TALI joined with representatives of DPS, the Private Security Board, and security, alarm, and locksmith associations to prepare for the 2007 legislative session. In a joint effort, HB 2833 was passed by the legislature. TALI members were instrumental in the development and passage of this initiative. The act covered many areas, including strengthening Article 1702 of the Occupations Code, and set the groundwork for future joint efforts of the professions regulated by the Private Security Board and The Texas Department of Public Safety, Private Security Bureau. Section 1702.104 of the bill was controversial in that it began requiring any person or company performing computer forensic investigations, data collections, analysis of computer-based data, or computer repairs to become a licensed Private Investigator, a requirement made based on the advice of the Private Investigator industry and without consultation of the computer forensic/investigations industry - fields which have extremely different skill sets. The law was later amended to exempt those people performing computer repairs from the PI license requirement. In 2006, the TALI magazine became a full color glossy professional journal entitled The Texas Investigator. 2006 saw TALI produce the first Southwest Super Conference (SWSC). Investigators attended the conference from New England, Colorado, Louisiana, and other states. In 2008, the TALI board redesigned the organization by creating local chapters in each city and major rural area of the state. The local chapters reported to five regional directors. This infrastructure allowed the individual members in each area to have a local representative who was familiar with local issues to represent them at the regional level. The regional directors, who previously had been mere figureheads, became more involved managers of their districts. For the first time, the regional directors could relay grassroots concerns to the board at quarterly meetings, thereby acting as liaisons between investigators and board members.

In the early '90s Fever One taught hip-hop to children at local community facilities and held after school programs at middle schools. He joined a group of graffiti artists, b-boys, and DJs to create the DVS crew (Dropping Vicious Styles). Most performances during the early '90s were for Seattle youth and many performances were staged at the Langston Hughes Cultural Arts Center. During this time, he staged youth b-boy battles and worked with at-risk children, teaching them dancing, graffiti art, DJing and MCing. In the summer of 1995 he traveled to Europe where he performed with local dancers from France, Germany, and Switzerland, exchanging styles and performing on the street. In the summer of 1997, he moved to the birthplace of hip-hop, the Bronx, so that he would be able to study and learn more about the history of hip-hop culture. He performed at the Centennial Anniversary of St. James Park in the Bronx and Funk Master Flex's Birthday Bash at the Palladium with KRS-One, danced on the DJ Honda video Check-the- Mic, and performed at the 23rd annual Zulu Nation Anniversary.

It is located at 1 Starokonyushenny Lane () in the Khamovniki District of Moscow. The Consulate, located in the same building until 2007, now operates from a new nearby building at 7 Bolshoy Levshinsky Lane.  The building  The Embassy occupies a listed neoclassical revival building, the Nikolay Mindovsky House, designed and built by Nikita Lazarev in 1906. Mindovsky family originated in Kineshma, where serf Ivan Ivanovich Mindovsky (1781‚Äì1853) launched his own textile mill. His grandson, Ivan Alexandrovich, commissioned the first historical Mindovsky House to Lev Kekushev (44, Povarskaya Street, present-day Embassy of New Zealand in Moscow). Next of kin, Nikolay Ivanovich, commissioned the second Mindovsky House to Nikita Lazarev. Various other members of the clan also owned mansions and apartment blocks in the city so as of 2008 there are six extant Mindovsky houses. Mindovsky House that became Embassy of Austria stands on a strategic corner lot visible from Prechictenka Street. In the 18th century the area was occupied by a spacious Gagarin family estate, destroyed by the fire of 1812, then by wooden Mukhanov estate. In 1899 the dilapidated Mukhanov property was purchased by real estate developers and split into three lots; the first two buildings were built to William Walcot's design in 1900‚Äì1902, the third was purchased by Mindovsky.

The L-shaped structure extends over 32√ó44 meters. Its two main parts intersect at 90 degrees, while the streets actually cross at a sharper angle ‚Äì this allowed placing a small garden in front of the corner rotunda hall, but the western facade with main entrance had to be tapered to fit into street boundary. Originally all the building was single story; in 1913 the owners rebuilt the eastern living wing into two stories. Eastern wing, which housed the consulate until 2007, was regularly remodelled later while the single- story formal halls of the western wing, facing Prechistensky Lane retain the original 1906 interiors. The Embassy of Austria moved into Mindovsky House in 1927. After the anschluss of 1938, it was used as an exclusive villa for foreign dignitaries, housing guests like Joachim von Ribbentrop (August 1939, see Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact) and Winston Churchill (October 1944). However, the rumour that Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed in Mindovsky House is, most likely, an urban legend. In April 1955 the building was the site of Austrian‚ÄìSoviet talks on the Austrian State Treaty and then became an embassy of independent Austria for a second time. Embassy of Austria. History.

He competes in Professional Darts Corporation events. CareerBDO career= Michels made three quarter final appearances in the BDO Open events in 2005, doing so in the Welsh Open, English Open and the German Open. He followed it up with another quarter final appearance, this time at the World Darts Trophy, one of the WDF majors. He defeated Tony Martin and Simon Whitlock before losing to Mervyn King. He then made the final of the Swedish Open, losing to Tony Eccles. Michels made his World Championship debut in 2006 but lost in the first round to Paul Hogan. It was a disappointing year for Michels, as he also suffered early exits in the World Darts Trophy and the International Darts League. Despite a semi-final showing in the Dortmund Open, 2007 was also a disappointment. As well as early exits in open tournaments, Michels played in three PDC Pro Tour events in the Netherlands and Belgium, losing in the first round in all three tournaments. 2008 was an improvement for the Dutchman, winning his maiden open tournament with the unranked West Brabent Open. He followed it up with a second tournament win with the Hungarian Open, beating local favourite N√°ndor Bezzeg in the final. On 27 September 2008 Michels added the 2008 WDF French Open to his growing list of titles defeating Welshman Robert Hughes in the final five legs to four. Despite his two ranking tournament wins, Michels did not earn enough points to earn a place in the 2009 BDO World Darts Championship and was forced to qualify for the event, but lost in the second round to Belgium's Kim Huybrechts. Michels has been able to maintain his form in 2009, reaching the semi-finals in the Vonderke Masters, German Gold Cup, Dortmund Open and the Swiss Open as well as winning the Open Holland. This form helped Michels qualify for the 2010 BDO World Darts Championship. He was defeated 3‚Äì1 in the first round by John Henderson. =PDC career= Michels switched to the PDC circuit shortly afterwards, taking part in his first Players Championship in Gibraltar. His PDC career started badly as he earned no money in his first eight events before finally winning ¬£200 for a last 64 place in a Players Championship in Wigan. He failed to qualify for the 2010 UK Open, earning just ¬£200 in eight qualifying events. 2011 proved to be a better year for Michels. He qualified for the UK Open where he lost in the first round to Antonio Alcinas and reached the last 16 of a Players Championship event in Canada. In January 2012, he entered the PDC 'Q School' qualifying tournament. He didn't qualify directly through any of the four events, but did finish joint 7th on the Order of Merit, comfortably inside the top 24 who received a Tour Card. In April, Michels earned a place in the Austrian Darts Open by defeating Dyson Parody and Tobias Hontsch in the European qualifier. He played Simon Whitlock in the first round and lost 6‚Äì4. He also qualified for the second European Tour event, the German Darts Championship courtesy of wins over Ante Vranjeka and Gino Vos. Michels played compatriot Raymond van Barneveld in the first round of the event in Berlin and was beaten 6‚Äì1. Michels failed to qualify for the 2013 UK Open as he finished 142nd on the Order of Merit, outside of the top 96 who claimed their places. He qualified for the European Darts Open, but lost 6‚Äì3 to Wes Newton in the first round. In September, Michels qualified for the German Darts Masters and beat Andy Smith 6‚Äì2 in the opening round, before coming back from 4‚Äì2 down to see off top 20 player Kim Huybrechts. Michels kept his run going with a 6‚Äì1 victory over compatriot Vincent van der Voort to reach the quarter-finals of a PDC event for the first time. However, the pressure of the occasion seemed to affect Michels as he averaged just 79.03 in a 6‚Äì0 defeat against Wayne Jones. His run in the event earned him ¬£3,000 which was the main reason in Michels finishing the year ninth on the European Order of Merit which has seen him qualify for his first PDC World Championship by claiming the second of four spots which were available to non-qualified players. Michels played John Part in the first round and lost the first two sets and was 2‚Äì0 down in legs in the third. However, Michels rallied to win the set and the next by taking out 120 with treble 20, double 20, double 10 to level the game, but couldn't win a leg in the decider to bow out of the tournament 3‚Äì2. Michels was 75th on the Order of Merit after the World Championship, outside of the top 64 who had full playing rights on the PDC. He entered Q School in an attempt to earn his place and lost in the final round 5‚Äì3 to Steve West on the fourth day. However, this result saw him finish inside the top 24 on the Q School Order of Merit to win a two-year tour card. Michels won three matches at the 10th Players Championship of the year, before losing 6‚Äì2 to Andy Hamilton in the last 16. This was very much Michels stand out display of 2014 as he could not get past the last 64 in any other event. He qualified for the 2015 German Darts Championship, but missed eight match darts during a 6‚Äì5 first round defeat to Ronny Huybrechts. In 2016 he played in all of the Challenge Tour events and reached the quarter-finals of the third one, where he lost 5‚Äì2 to Ryan Searle.

The final bill was passed on September 29, 2010. No specific penalties are given; those are to be set by the FCC in its regulations. A TV broadcaster or distributor is \\"in compliance\\" if it installs and uses suitable equipment and software. Unlike some FCC regulations, cable system operators are subject to the rule in addition to broadcast stations. After issuing regulations, the FCC began enforcing those regulations on December 13, 2012, after a one-year grace period. History The bill was the United States Senate companion to proposed legislation in the House of Representatives by Representative Anna Eshoo (D-Calif), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. She wrote the bill after a loud commercial interrupted a family dinner. After asking her brother-in-law to turn down the volume, he allegedly said, \\"Well, you‚Äôre the congresswoman. Why don‚Äôt you do something about it?\\". According to Eshoo, no one turned her down when she looked for supporters to the bill, and it passed the Communications Subcommittee. The technical requirements for measuring loudness were taken entirely from a formerly voluntary \\"recommended practice\\" issued by the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) on November 4, 2009. Eshoo told the Wall Street Journal that legislation to mitigate the volume of commercials on TV was among the most popular pieces of legislation she has sponsored in her 18 years in Congress. Prior to adjourning for the midterm recess, the United States Senate unanimously passed the bill on September 30, 2010. Before it was signed into law in December, minor differences between the two versions had to be worked out when Congress returned to Washington after the November 2 election. The reconciled bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 15, 2010, as Public Law 111-311. On May 27, 2011, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), Media Bureau (MB) Docket 11-93, to implement the CALM Act. Twelve parties filed comments, which are now available in the FCC's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS). The FCC adopted its rules on December 13, 2011, and they took effect on December 13, 2012. Television viewers are asked to report loud commercials that violate this bill to the FCC.

Values over 85% are typically regarded as suffering from traffic congestion, with queues of vehicles beginning to form.

The film stars Ross Partridge, Elise Muller, Greta Gerwig, and Steve Zissis. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2008. The film was given a limited release by Sony Pictures Classics on July 13, 2008. Plot Four actors--Matt (Ross Partridge), Catherine (Elise Muller), Michelle (Greta Gerwig), and Chad (Steve Zissis)--attend an art festival and watch a low-budget movie directed by Jett (Jett Garner). After the showing, Jett explains to them that he kept the budget so low by not telling his actors they were in a movie until the final piece was ready. The group then goes to an after party; however, Matt is unable to gain entry into the club after not wanting to appear desperate by asking his old friend Jett to get him in. The four actors go to a different bar, where they decide to go to Chad's isolated cabin in the woods to write their own movie to star in, since they were fed up having only been cast as extras. After arriving at the cabin, Michelle gets drunk and decides to go to bed, whereupon Chad hits on her, although she rejects his advances, telling him he is like a brother. Later, Michelle rushes outside of the cabin to vomit, where she encounters a man with a bag over his head. The next morning, Michelle believes this to have been a dream and decides to tell the others in the hopes of creating a horror movie based around the character 'baghead'. At night, the group gathers to brainstorm ideas. Michelle writes several notes to Matt to meet her in her room, before she goes to bed. While in her room, a figure wearing a bag over the head enters. At first, Michelle believes it to be Matt, but she becomes increasingly uncomfortable before the figure eventually leaves. Upset, Michelle confronts Matt, who denies it was him, leading the pair to believe it was perhaps instead Catherine trying to scare Michelle, because she is jealous of her connection with Matt. Catherine also denies the accusations and angrily leaves the cabin to smoke a cigarette, while Matt convinces Michelle to stay at the cabin. The following morning, Chad wakes up Matt and Michelle and says he cannot find Catherine. Chad then quickly learns of Michelle's advances on Matt, and upset he too leaves the cabins, only for his screams to be heard minutes later. Matt and Michelle find his ripped t-shirt in the woods, but believe it to be a prank and so go back to the cabin. Michelle again advances on Matt, but feeling bad for Chad, Matt goes upstairs where he is attacked by figures wearing bags over their heads, revealed to be Chad and Catherine getting revenge for the romance between Matt and Michelle. Later, as night falls, the group hangs out before Matt and Chad see a figure through the window. The group investigates outside and finds their car has been disabled before apparently encountering the actual \\"baghead\\" figure. Matt and Chad attempt to attack him, but upon seeing he has a knife, the members of the group flee into the cabin, and they barricade themselves in until morning. The following day, the group decides to hike the to the nearest freeway. After hours of walking, the group becomes lost in the woods before stumbling upon an abandoned car. As Chad is about to break a window to get in, \\"baghead\\" appears and chases the group through the woods. Matt is caught and stabbed to death in front of the others. Catherine and Michelle reach the freeway and attempt to flag down a car, but it continues to drive on past them. Chad emerges from the woods further up the road and is subsequently hit by the car as it swerves to miss the girls. Catherine and Michelle help the unconscious Chad into the truck before Matt emerges from the woods uninjured and \\"baghead\\" is revealed to be Jett.

The film is an adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's 1899 novel Resurrection (Voskraeseniye). The screenplay was written by Maxwell Anderson with contributions from a number of writers, including Preston Sturges and Thornton Wilder. Producer Samuel Goldwyn made the film to showcase Russian actress Anna Sten, his newest discovery. It was Goldwyn who named the film \\"We Live Again\\", on the theory that it meant the same thing as \\"Resurrection\\" and was easier to understand. The first film adaptation of the Tolstoy novel was made in 1909 by D. W. Griffith, and ran 10 minutes.Erickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie) Numerous other film versions have been made since then. Plot Russian Prince Dmitri Nekhlyudov (Fredric March) seduces innocent young Katusha Maslova (Anna Sten), a servant to his aunts. After they spend the night together in the greenhouse, Dmitri leaves the next morning, outraging Katusha by not leaving a note for her, only money. When she becomes pregnant, she is fired, and when the baby is born, it dies and is buried unbaptized. Katusha then goes to Moscow, where she falls into a life of prostitution, poverty and degradation. Dmitri, now engaged to Missy (Jane Baxter), the daughter of the wealthy judge, Prince Kortchagin (C. Aubrey Smith), is called for jury duty in Kotchagin's court for a murder trial. The case is about a merchant who has been killed, and Dmitri is astonished to see that Katusha is one of the defendants. The jury finds that she is guilty of \\"giving the powder to the merchant Smerkov without intent to rob\\", but because they neglected to say without intent to kill, even though the jury intended to free her, the judge sentences her to five years hard labor in Siberia. Feeling guilty about abandoning Katusha years before, and wanting to redeem her and himself as well, the once-callous nobleman attempts to get her released from prison. He fails in his efforts, so he returns to the prison to ask Katusha to marry him. When he doesn't show up on the day the prisoners are to be transported, Katusha gives up hope, but then he appears on the border of Siberia where the prisoners are being processed: he has divided his land among his servants and wants to \\"live again\\" with her forgiveness, help and love.TCM Full synopsisBeaver, Jim Plot summary (IMDB) Cast *Anna Sten as Katusha Maslova *Fredric March as Prince Dmitri Nekhlyudov *Jane Baxter as Missy Kortchagin *C.

Joseph Breen wrote to Will H. Hays: \\"Though dealing with a sex affair and its attendant consequences, the story has been handled with such fine emphasis on the moral values of repentance and retribution, as to emerge with a definite spiritual quality. We feel that this picture could, in fact, serve as a model for the proper treatment of the element of illicit sex in pictures.\\" The film was in production from 12 June to 2 August 1934. The New York opening took place during the week of 1 November of that year, with the general American release on 16 November.TCM Overview We Live Again was the third film version of Resurrection in seven years. It had been made as a silent film, under its original title, in 1927, and again under its original title, as an early talkie starring John Boles in 1931. The story has not been made into a theatrical film version in English since We Live Again. Reception The film was a box office disappointment.

Who competed in the British Darts Organisation and is the former captain of Scotland. Sharp was nicknamed Pancho due to his moustache which resembled that of Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa. Career Sharp made three appearances in the Winmau World Masters before making his World Championship debut in 1990, reaching the quarter finals. He defeated Kim Jensen and John Lowe before losing to Phil Taylor, who went on to win his first world title and dominate the sport. In 1991, he lost in the first round to Cliff Lazarenko. He failed to qualify for the 1992 World Championship, but returned in 1993, beating Peter Hunt in the first round but lost in the second round to Alan Warriner. It was the 1994 World Championship where Sharp recorded his best performance. The sport suffered a split with the BDO's top players forming a new governing body called the World Darts Council (later known as the Professional Darts Corporation). With the big names gone, Sharp was one of those who took advantage. After beating Trevor Nurse in the first round, he defeated Roland Scholten, the only seed to progress through round one in the second round. He then beat Denmark's Troels Rusel in the quarter finals before losing to Canada's John Part 4-1 in sets. Sharp was the only player to win a set against eventual champion Part in the entire tournament. Sharp did not progress further in his career, reaching only the second round in the 1995 World Championship and then quietly disappeared from the scene. He did appear on TV's Bullseye (UK game show) series 13 where he achieved a score of 328. Due to it being 301 or more, the programme doubled this amount to ¬£656 which was given to the contestants' chosen charity, the Kent Air Ambulance Air Appeal. Sharp then made a comeback in the 2006 Scotland National Championship, reaching the quarter finals. He then played in the 2006 World Masters but lost in the first round to Jarkko Komula. He returned to the Scotland National Championship in 2008, but lost in the first round to the tournament's eventual winner Mike Veitch. He most recently played in the 2008 Welsh Open, reaching the last 128 stage. Ronnie currently enjoys playing with Towerlands Sports Club in the Dreghorn League and is heavily involved with darts at county level selecting and playing for Ayrshire county team.

Its scope is similar to that of head-up displays (HUD) on an aircrew's visor or reticle. An HMD provides the pilot with situation awareness, an enhanced image of the scene, and in military applications cue weapons systems, to the direction their head is pointing. Applications which allow cuing of weapon systems are referred to as helmet-mounted sight and display (HMSD) or helmet-mounted sights (HMS). Requirement Aviation HMD designs serve these purposes: * using the head angle as a pointer to direct air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons seekers or other sensors (e.g., radar, FLIR) to a target merely by pointing his head at the target and actuating a switch via HOTAS controls. In close combat prior to HMDs, the pilot had to align the aircraft to shoot at a target. HMDs allow the pilot to simply point his head at a target, designate it to weapon and shoot. * displaying targeting and aircraft performance information (such as airspeed, altitude, target range, weapon seeker status, \\"g\\", etc.) to the pilot while \\"heads-up\\", eliminating the need to look inside the flightdeck. * displaying sensor video for the purpose of: ** verification that the chosen sensor has been cued to the right target or location without requiring the pilot to look inside the flightdeck ** viewing outside terrain using sensor video in degraded visual conditions. HMD systems, combined with High Off-Boresight (HOBS) weapons, results in the ability for aircrew to attack and destroy nearly any target seen by the pilot. These systems allow targets to be designated with minimal aircraft maneuvering, minimizing the time spent in the threat environment, and allowing greater lethality, survivability, and pilot situational awareness. History In 1962, Hughes Aircraft Company revealed the Electrocular, a compact CRT, head-mounted monocular display that reflected a TV signal onto a transparent eyepiece.\\"Science: Second Sight\\", Time, Friday, Apr. 13, 1962Dr. James Miller, Fullerton, CA, research psychologist for the Ground Systems Group at Hughes, \\"I've Got a Secret\\", April 9, 1962 on CBS\\"Third Eye for Space Explorers\\", Popular Electronics, July 1962\\"‚ÄòSeeing Things‚Äô with Electrocular\\", Science & Mechanics, Aug, 1962 The first aircraft with simple HMD devices appeared for experimental purpose in the mid-1970s to aid in targeting heat seeking missiles. These rudimentary devices were better described as Helmet- Mounted Sights. The US Navy's Visual Target Acquisition System (VTAS), made by Honeywell Corporation was a simple mechanical \\"ring and bead\\"‚Äìstyle sight fitted to the front of the pilot's helmet that was flown in the 1974‚Äì78 ACEVAL/AIMVAL on U.S. F-14 and F-15 fighters. VTAS received praise for its effectiveness in targeting off-boresight missiles, but the U.S. did not pursue fielding it except for integration into late-model Navy F-4 Phantoms equipped with the AIM-9 Sidewinder from 1969. HMDs were also introduced in helicopters during this time - examples include the Boeing AH-64 Apache with the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS) demonstrated in 1985. Later, Mirage F1AZ of the SAAF (South African Air Force) used a locally developed helmet-mounted sight. This enables the pilot to make bore attacks, without having to maneuver to the optimum firing position. The SAAF was also the first air force to fly the helmet sight operationally . Operational jet fighters with HMD (Mirage F1AZ) were fielded by the South African Air Force. After the South African system had been proven in combat, playing a role in downing Soviet aircraft over Angola, the Soviets embarked on a crash program to counter the technology. As a result, the MiG-29 was fielded in 1985 with an HMD and a high off-boresight weapon (R-73), giving them an advantage in close in maneuvering engagements. Several nations responded with programs to counter the MiG-29/HMD/R-73 (and later Su-27) combination once its effectiveness was known, principally through access to former East German MiG-29s that were operated by the unified German Air Force. One successful HMD was the Israeli Air Force Elbit DASH series, fielded in conjunction with the Python 4, in the early 1990s. The U.S., UK, and Germany pursued a HMD combined with ASRAAM systems. Technical difficulties led to the U.S. abandoning ASRAAM, instead funding development of the AIM-9X and the Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System in 1990. American and European fighter HMDs became widely used in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The first civilian use of HMD on aircraft was the Elbit SkyLens HMD on ATR 72/42 airplane. ATR, Elbit Developing Wearable HUD AIN online (July 2016) Technology While conceptually simple, implementation of aircraft HMDs is quite complex. There are many variables: * precision ‚Äì the angular error between the line-of-sight and the derived cue. The position of the helmet is what is used to point the missile; it thus must be calibrated and fit securely on the pilot's head. The line between the pilot's eye and the reticle on the visor is known as the line of sight (LOS) between the aircraft and the intended target. The user's eye must stay aligned with the sight; in other words, current HMDs cannot sense where the eye is looking, but can place a \\"pipper\\" between the eye and the target. * latency or slew rate ‚Äì how much lag there is between the helmet and the cue. * field of regard ‚Äì the angular range over which the sight can still produce a suitably accurate measurement. * weight and balance ‚Äì total helmet weight and its center of gravity, which are particularly important under high \\"g\\" maneuvers. Weight is the largest problem faced by fighter aircraft HMD designers. This is much less a concern for helicopter applications, making elaborate helicopter HMDs common. * safety and flightdeck compatibility, including ejection seat compatibility. * optical characteristics ‚Äì calibration, sharpness, distant focus (or 'Collimation', a technique used to present the images at a distant focus, which improves the readability of images), monocular vs. binocular imagery, eye dominance, and binocular rivalry. * durability and ability to handle day-to-day wear and tear. * cost, including integration and training. * fit and interfacing the aviator's head to the aircraft ‚Äì head anthropometry and facial anatomy make helmet-fitting a crucial factor in the aviator's ability to interface with the aircraft systems. Misalignment or helmet shift can cause an inaccurate picture. =Head tracking= HMD designs must sense the orientation (elevation, azimuth and roll) and in some cases the position (x, y, and z) of the pilot's head relative to the airframe with sufficient precision even under high \\"g\\", vibration, and during rapid head movement. Five basic methods are used in current HMD technology ‚Äì inertial, optical, electromagnetic, sonic, and hybrid. Hybrid trackers use a combination of sensors such as inertial and optical to improve tracking accuracy, update rate, and latency. Hybrid inertial optical Hybrid inertial tracking systems employ a sensitive Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and an optical sensor to provide reference to the aircraft. MEMS based IMUs benefit from high update rates such as 1,000 Hz but suffer from precession and drift over time, so they cannot be used alone. In this class of tracker, the optical sensor is used to constrain IMU drift. As a result, hybrid inertial/optical trackers feature low latency and high accuracy. The Thales Visionix Scorpion HMCS and HMIT HMDs utilize a tracker made by InterSense called the Hybrid Optical-based Inertial Tracker (HObIT). Optical Optical systems employ infrared emitters on the helmet (or flightdeck) infrared detectors in the flightdeck (or helmet), to measure the pilot's head position. The main limitations are restricted fields of regard and sensitivity to sunlight or other heat sources. The MiG-29/AA-11 Archer system uses this technology. The Cobra HMD as used on both the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS39 Gripen both employ the optical helmet tracker developed by Denel Optronics (now part of Zeiss Optronics). Electromagnetic Electromagnetic sensing designs use coils (in the helmet) placed in an alternating field (generated in the flightdeck) to produce alternating electrical voltages based on the movement of the helmet in multiple axes. This technique requires precise magnetic mapping of the flightdeck to account for ferrous and conductive materials in the seat, flightdeck sills and canopy to reduce angular errors in the measurement. Sonic Acoustic sensing designs use ultrasonic sensors to monitor the pilot's head position while being updated by computer software in multiple axes. Typical operating frequencies are in the 50 to 100 kHz range and can be made to carry audio sound information directly to the pilot's ears via subcarrier modulation of the sensong ultrasonic sensing signals. =Optics= Older HMDs typically employ a compact CRT embedded in the helmet, and suitable optics to display symbology on to the pilot's visor or reticle, focused at infinity. Modern HMDs have dispensed with the CRT in favor of micro-displays such as liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) or liquid crystal display (LCD) along with an LED illuminator to generate the displayed image. Advanced HMDs can also project FLIR or NVG imagery. A recent improvement is the capability to display color symbols and video. Major systems Systems are presented in rough chronological order of initial operating capability. =Integrated Helmet And Display Sight System (IHADSS)= IHADSS In 1985, the U.S. Army fielded the AH-64 Apache and with it the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS), a new helmet concept in which the role of the helmet was expanded to provide a visually coupled interface between the aviator and the aircraft. The Honeywell M142 IHADSS is fitted with a 40¬∞-by-30¬∞ field of view, video-with- symbology monocular display. IR emitters allow a slewable thermographic camera sensor, mounted on the nose of the aircraft, to be slaved to the aviator's head movements. The display also enables Nap-of-the-earth night navigation. IHADSS is also used on the Italian Agusta A129 Mangusta. : =ZSh-5 / Shchel-3UM= The Russian designed Shchel-3UM HMD design is fit to the ZSh-5 series helmet (and later ZSh-7 helmets), and is used on the MiG-29 and Su-27 in conjunction with the R-73 (missile). The HMD/Archer combination gave the MiG-29 and Su-27 a significantly improved close combat capability and quickly became the most widely deployed HMD in the world. =Display and sight helmet (DASH)= The Elbit Systems DASH III was the first modern Western HMD to achieve operational service. Development of the DASH began during the mid-1980s, when the IAF issued a requirement for F-15 and F-16 aircraft. The first design entered production around 1986, and the current GEN III helmet entered production during the early to mid-1990s. The current production variant is deployed on IDF F-15, and F-16 aircraft. Additionally, it has been certified on the F/A-18 and F-5. The DASH III has been exported and integrated into various legacy aircraft, including the MiG-21. It also forms the baseline technology for the US JHMCS. The DASH GEN III is a wholly embedded design, where the complete optical and position sensing coil package is built within the helmet (either USAF standard HGU-55/P or the Israeli standard HGU-22/P) using a spherical visor to provide a collimated image to the pilot. A quick- disconnect wire powers the display and carries video drive signals to the helmet's Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). DASH is closely integrated with the aircraft's weapon system, via a MIL-STD-1553B bus. =Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS)= JHMCS After the U.S. withdrawal from ASRAAM, the U.S. pursued and fielded JHMCS in conjunction with the Raytheon AIM-9X, in November 2003 with the 12th and 19th Fighter Squadrons at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. The Navy conducted RDT&E; on the F/A-18C as lead platform for JHMCS, but fielded it first on the F/A-18 Super Hornet E and F aircraft in 2003. The USAF is also integrating JHMCS into its F-15E, F-15C, and F-16C aircraft. JHMCS is a derivative of the DASH III and the Kaiser Agile Eye HMDs, and was developed by Vision Systems International (VSI), a joint venture company formed by Rockwell Collins and Elbit (Kaiser Electronics is now owned by Rockwell Collins). Boeing integrated the system into the F/A-18 and began low-rate initial production delivery in fiscal year 2002. JHMCS is employed in the F/A-18A++/C/D/E/F, F-15C/D/E, and F-16 Block 40/50 with a design that is 95% common to all platforms. Unlike the DASH, which is integrated into the helmet itself, JHMCS assemblies attach to modified HGU-55/P, HGU-56/P or HGU-68/P helmets. JHMCS employs a newer, faster digital processing package, but retains the same type of electromagnetic position sensing as the DASH. The CRT package is more capable, but remains limited to monochrome presentation of cursive symbology. JHMCS provides support for raster scanned imagery to display FLIR/IRST pictures for night operations and provides collimated symbology and imagery to the pilot. The integration of the night-vision goggles with the JHMCS was a key requirement of the program. When combined with the AIM-9X, an advanced short-range dogfight weapon that employs a Focal Plane Array seeker and a thrust vectoring tail control package, JHMCS allows effective target designation up to 80 degrees either side of the aircraft's nose. In March 2009, a successful 'Lock on After Launch' firing of an ASRAAM at a target located behind the wing-line of the ‚Äòshooter' aircraft, was demonstrated by a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F/A-18 using JHMCS. =Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting (HMIT)= Scorpion Helmet Mounted Display Thales Introduced the Scorpion Head/Helmet-Mounted Display System to the military aviation market in 2008. In 2010 Scorpion was the winner of the USAF/ANG/AFRes Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting (HMIT) program. The HMIT system was qualified and deployed on both A-10 and F-16 platforms in 2012. Starting in 2018, the installed base of HMIT systems are going through a helmet tracker upgrade. The original AC magnetic tracking sensor is being replaced by an inertial-optical hybrid tracker called Hybrid Optical based Inertial Tracker (HObIT). The HObIT was developed by InterSense and tested by Thales in 2014. Scorpion has the distinction of being the first HMD introduced and deployed that can display color symbols. It is used along with the aircraft mission system to cue the aircraft targeting pod gimbaled sensor and high off- boresight missile. Unlike most HMDs which require custom helmets, Scorpion was designed to be installed on a standard issue HGU-55/P and HGU-68/P helmets and is fully compatible with standard issue U.S. Pilot Flight Equipment without special fitting. It is also fully compatible with standard unmodified AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggles (NVG) and Panoramic Night Vision Goggles (PNVG). Pilots, using Scorpion, can view both the night vision image and the symbols on the display. Scorpion uses a novel optical system featuring a light-guide optical element (LOE) which provides a compact color collimated image to the pilot. This allows the display to be positioned between the pilot's eyes and NVGs. The display can be positioned as the pilot wishes thereby eliminating the need for precise helmet position on the user's head. Software correction accommodates the display position, providing an accurate image to the pilot and allowing the Scorpion HMCS to be installed onto a pilot's existing helmet with no special fitting. A visor can be deployed in front of the display providing protection during ejection. The visor can be clear, glare, high contrast, gradient, or laser protective. An NVG mount can be installed in place of the visor during flight. Once installed, NVGs can be placed in front of the display, thus allowing the pilot to view both the display symbols as well as the NVG image simultaneously. =Aselsan AVCI= Aselsan of Turkey is working to develop a similar system to the French TopOwl Helmet, called the AVCI Helmet Integrated Cueing System. The system will also be utilized into the T-129 Turkish Attack Helicopter. =TopOwl-F(Topsight/TopNight)= The French thrust vectoring Matra MICA (missile) for its Dassault Rafale and late- model Mirage 2000 fighters was accompanied by the Topsight HMD by Sextant Avionique. TopSight provides a 20 degree FoV for the pilot's right eye, and cursive symbology generated from target and aircraft parameters. Electromagnetic position sensing is employed. The Topsight helmet uses an integral embedded design, and its contoured shape is designed to provide the pilot with a wholly unobstructed field of view. TopNight, a Topsight derivative, is designed specifically for adverse weather and night air to ground operations, employing more complex optics to project infrared imagery overlaid with symbology. The most recent version the Topsight has been designated TopOwl-F, and is qualified on the Mirage-2000-5 Mk2 and Mig-29K. =Eurofighter Helmet-Mounted Symbology System= HMSS The Eurofighter Typhoon utilizes the Helmet-Mounted Symbology System (HMSS) developed by BAE Systems and Pilkington Optronics. Named the Striker and later version Striker II. It is capable of displaying both raster imagery and cursive symbology, with provisions for embedded NVGs. As with the DASH helmet, the system employs integrated position sensing to ensure that symbols representing outside-world entities move in line with the pilot's head movements. =Helmet-Mounted Display System= Helmet-Mounted Display System for the F-35 Lightning II Helmet Mounted System Striker II from BAE System on DSEI-2019 Vision Systems International (VSI; the Elbit Systems/Rockwell Collins joint venture) along with Helmet Integrated Systems, Ltd. developed the Helmet-Mounted Display System (HMDS) for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. In addition to standard HMD capabilities offered by other systems, HMDS fully utilizes the advanced avionics architecture of the F-35 and provides the pilot video with imagery in day or night conditions. Consequently, the F-35 is the first tactical fighter jet in 50 years to fly without a HUD. A BAE Systems helmet was considered when HMDS development was experiencing significant problems, but these issues were eventually worked out. The Helmet-Mounted Display System was fully operational and ready for delivery in July 2014. =Jedeye= Jedeye is a new system recently introduced by Elbit Systems especially to meet Apache and other rotary wing platform requirements. The system is designed for day, night and brownout flight environments. Jedeye has a 70 x 40 degree FOV and 2250x1200 pixels resolution. =Cobra= Sweden's JAS 39 Gripen fighter utilizes the Cobra HMD, developed by Denel Optronics of South Africa, and Saab.

It is subject to the Archdiocese of ƒêakovo-Osijek. The seat of the diocese is in Sremska Mitrovica. Territory It includes Serbian part of the region of Syrmia, which is administratively divided between the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and the City of Belgrade. The diocese includes adherents mainly from Croat and Hungarian ethnic communities. History Roman Catholic Diocese of Syrmia was created sometime after the final Hungarian conquest of the region of Syrmia at the end of 12th and the beginning of 13th century. In 1521, after the fall of Belgrade, the region of Syrmia was overrun by Ottoman Turks. Roman Catholic Church continued to appoint bishops for Syrmia, but they were living mainly outside their diocese. During the Austro-Turkish wars of (1683‚Äì1699) and (1716‚Äì1718), entire region of Syrmia was liberated from Turkish rule and incorporated into the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1773, the Diocese of Syrmia and Diocese of Bosnia and ƒêakovo were joined into a single enlarged diocese that was named the Diocese of Bosnia-ƒêakovo and Syrmia. In 1918, the region was incorporated into newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, known as Yugoslavia. In 1945, region of Syrmia became part of Serbia within Yugoslavia. In 1963, name of the diocese was changed to Diocese of ƒêakovo or Bosnia and Srijem. After the breakup of Yugoslavia (1991‚Äì1992) there were several initiatives towards the renewal of the separate Diocese of Srijem. On 15 July 1999 the Holy See created the territory with a special authority to govern the Serbian part of the Diocese of Djakovo or Bosna and Srijem and on 1 October 1999 was established as a General Vicariate for Srijem with the residence in Petrovaradin. On 18 June 2008 the Diocese of ƒêakovo or Bosnia and Srijem was divided into two administrative units: the Archdiocese of ƒêakovo-Osijek and the Diocese of Srijem. The current Bishop is ƒêuro Ga≈°paroviƒá, appointed in 2008. Previously he had been the auxiliary bishop of the parent diocese.

The panel, probably inspired by an original lost drawing of Leonardo da Vinci, illustrates a marriage for economic reasons between persons of different ages. The painting is in the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art. It was donated to the museum in 1965 by the Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen- Bornemisza. Context and iconography Ill-Matched Lovers, oil on panel, c. 1520-1525, National Gallery of Art, Washington Many artists depicted the theme of marriage between people of differing age. Goya, Leonardo da Vinci, D√ºrer and Lucas Cranach the Elder dedicated works and studies to this subject. The representation of an old man marrying a younger woman is more common, but here Matsys depicts the opposite: a rich old woman marries a young man. Matsys made another version with the man older, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Being caressed by the young man, the old woman offers him a wedding ring with her right hand and opens her bag, smoothed by the man's left hand. The mockery, hypocrisy and foolishness of the scene is highlighted by the burlesque features of the characters and, in particular, by the figure at right, shown putting the necklace spread on the table inside a box. The \\"grotesque marriage\\" is also present in the satirical literature, as in the poem Ship of Fools by Sebastian Brant (1494), which in its 52nd chapter tackles the \\"marriage-for-money\\" theme. The subject is treated by Erasmus of Rotterdam in his The Praise of Folly (1509).

Further fortified in the Middle Ages, tradition holds that it was for several centuries the seat of Clan MacKinnon.Scotland an Oxford Archaeological Guide, Oxford University Press, 1998, It is located east of Kirkibost on the west shore of Loch Slapin.  History  The original structure of Dun Ringill is consistent with an Iron Age Broch dating to approximately the first years of the common era. The main and subordinate structures were occupied and modified throughout its history until the 19th century. Tradition relates that the structure was occupied by the MacKinnons as their clan seat well before the 16th century. It is mentioned in historical texts in the 16th century, after which the MacKinnons moved their seat to Dunakin.The Medieval Castles of Skye and Lochalsh pp. 39-43. Miket, R., and Roberts, D. Birlin Limited, 2007, .  Description  Dun Ringill doorway Dun Ringill today is a stacked stone ruin overlooking Loch Slapin. The present structure is approximately in height and on each side, with a ditch following the outer wall. Its most notable feature is the central landward facing doorway approximately high that leads into the center of the structure. The interior of the structure contained two rectangular buildings measuring . The original layout was similar to that of a broch, a form of complex Atlantic roundhouse. A stone wall foundation encloses area adjacent to the structure. Similarly to other castles and fortified houses, the wall probably formed a defensive perimeter and livestock enclosure. The remains of the wall itself are hidden by vegetation. A site survey has shown that there are remains of other buildings in the immediate vicinity; and although their age is uncertain, it is likely their construction and occupation was throughout the history of Dun Ringill up until the 19th century. Dun Ringill perimeter wall indicated by the blue lines To the north and west is a hilly coastal plain. Loch Slapin lies to the east and south of the structure. On either side of the structure are earth and stone ramps that descend down to the ocean. These ramps likely allowed easy access to the water and shipping. Since roads in this part of Skye did not exist until recent times, sea travel was the predominant mode of transportation.  In popular culture  The rock band Jethro Tull performed a song entitled \\"Dun Ringill\\" on their 1979 Stormwatch album. The lyrics call for a meeting down by Dun Ringill during the wee hours of a stormy night, when \\"we'll watch the old gods play\\".

It began serialization in Bessatsu Young Magazine (now Young Magazine) on December 11, 2005 and has since been compiled into 22 volumes by Kodansha. It was adapted into two anime series produced by Feel animation studio; a twelve-episode television show aired from April 5 to June 21, 2010 on AT-X, and an original video animation series from December 22, 2008 to April 6, 2015. Plot Keita Suminoe is a third-year Japanese middle school student living with his father, stepmother, and older twin stepsisters, Ako and Riko. Since the remarriage of their parents at childhood, the siblings have always been affectionately close and supportive of one another. Nowadays the trio see their opposites in a noticeably less platonic fashion; Ako and Riko frequently flirt and lust after Keita while, much to his stress, he fights the urge to give in to them. Characters ; : :Keita Suminoe is the main protagonist of the series. He is 15 years old, and is a third-year middle school student who is part of a blended family after his father remarried some years previously (Keita's mother having died when he was young). He was raised with two stepsisters, Ako and Riko, who are a year older than he is and have developed more-than-filial feelings for him. As a result, now that they are high school age, Keita finds it increasingly difficult to retain his modest, dignified morals; especially when exposed to his parents' shockingly permissive attitudes. A track and field club member, Keita is athletic more than he is academic; however he strives to be, and eventually is, accepted to the same high school as his stepsisters. There, he is a first-year high school student in the same class as Miharu, with Yuzuki Kiryu as their homeroom teacher. ; : :Bright and cheery, Ako Suminoe is a 16-year-old, first-year high school student who is one of two stepsisters to Keita and twin sister to Riko. The more intellectual of the pair, Ako is educated, maternal, responsible, the manager of the Student Council General Affairs, skilled at cooking, homemaking, and endeavors to maintain a prim and proper demeanor. In spite of this imposing fa√ßade however, she is outwardly emotional, childish, whiny, reluctant, easily embarrassed and perverse; her most well-known open secret. Having grown up with Keita since toddlerhood, Ako is altruistic and, of course, in love with him. As such she isn't afraid of abusing her authority on the student council to either make a pass at Keita, or cover up embarrassing occurrences. ; : :Riko Suminoe is a 16-year-old first-year high school student and second stepsister to Keita. Though less academically accomplished than her twin, Riko is cunning, insightful, crafty, an active member of the Disciplinary Committee, and boldly open about her personal life and sexuality. Surprisingly, she cannot bring herself to kiss Keita in front of others. In contrast to Ako, she is highly skilled in physical activities and sometimes helps out with various sports clubs who need another person temporarily for training. She is known however to be soft-spoken, clumsy, temperamental, and weaker to alcohol than her sister and Keita. Riko is most recognized for wearing an adhesive bandage on her left cheek, ostensibly to cover up a scar that from when Keita threw a toy at her when they were children. There may not even be a scar, but Riko never lets anyone see what's under the bandage. It is hinted that Riko keeps wearing a bandage as a visible reminder for Keita to keep thinking about her. Riko is ardently fond of her stepbrother and forever fighting with Ako over his affections. ; : :Miharu Mikuni is a third-year middle school student who enters into the same high school class as Keita. A fairly quiet and unassuming character, she comes to his attention when she delivers Keita his entrance exam results; having passed, he joyfully befriends her. Unlike the other girls, Miharu is comparatively meek, easily intimidated and predisposed to anxiety; as such, she suffers from enuresis (which becomes a running gag in the series). Her relationship with Keita is mostly platonic; what feelings she does have for him are generally overshadowed by the not-too- greatly over-imagined images she has of him and his stepsisters. She sometimes fantasizes about Keita making non-consensual advances against her, but initially doesn't seem have any romantic interest in him. This situation may not last as she seems to be (glacially) slowly developing a romantic interest in him after he helps her out of various (and sometimes extremely embarrassing) situations (that are usually but unintentionally caused by either the twins or Mikazuki) and keeps his mouth shut about them. Her fondness for Keita grew noticeably when he 'tripped' during a race (actually hurting his leg a little) so that she could finish first and experience what it felt like to win a sporting event. Of the entire cast, Miharu is the only bespectacled female character. Later on, her feelings for Keita grow and she becomes more aggressive in pursuing him, much to the chagrin of Ako and Riko. ; : :Peppy and outgoing, Mikazuki Kiryu is a second-year middle school student and the younger sister of Yuzuki Kiryu. She enters her third-year middle school when Keita starts his first year in high school. She is much more mature for her age than her sister is, and tends to keep a mostly level head when her sister is losing hers. An underclassman to the rest of the cast, Mikazuki looks up to everyone, especially Keita, who she has a crush on. However, she seems to be just as interested in amusing herself by watching the antics and reactions of others as in actually winning him over. She considers her sister, Yuzuki, and Keita to be two of a kind, well suited for each other, and enjoys watching them try to act like a normal teacher and student. She becomes one of the few characters outside of Ako and Riko to discover that Yuzuki and Keita are secretly in a relationship when she bursts in on the two making out in Yuzuki's apartment. She seems to develop some feelings for Keita herself after the group trip to the beach. She also shares a certain genetic condition with her sister that is revealed when the girls take a bath during the beach trip. ; : :Yuzuki Kiryu is a recently hired 24-year-old homeroom and Japanese History teacher at the fictional Gakush≈´ Senior High, and the older sister of Mikazuki. While she constantly berates herself whenever she makes mistakes, she is a caring teacher who can lay down the law when necessary but tends to get herself and others in trouble when she acts impulsively over perceived misconduct without finding out the full story. Single, unmarried, independent, and noticeably eccentric, she is initially disgusted with Keita and his relationship with Ako and Riko, to the point of unduly crusading against it. Ultimately, and despite her age difference, she develops conflicting feelings for Keita herself. An obsessive fan of anime, manga and cosplay, Yuzuki's apartment contains a large collection of merchandise, books, games and posters; a particularly favored theme of hers being samurai. She is so obsessed that her parents forced her to either give up her hobbies permanently or get a place of her own (which she did). She often has to eat cheap ramen as she spends most of her money on so much paraphernalia to the point that it clutters up her apartment and she can't invite anyone inside without them discovering her hobby. Much to her humiliation, Yuzuki is a virgin. In the manga, Yuzuki and Keita eventually become closer, admit their mutual feelings for one another, and start dating in secret, a fact only known by Ako and Riko (but eventually discovered by Mikazuki and suspected by other characters), who despite being angry at her for getting involved with her own student, respect his decision, stating that in the end he will return to their side, Keita's parents also know about their relationship and accepted it. Later on, she breaks up with Keita after escaping to Hokkaido as she didn't want to be his girlfriend anymore. ; : :He is Keita's best friend from middle school. He is jealous of Keita's relationship with his sisters and other girls. He is also a pervert, he is hopelessly infatuated with Suminoe sisters. ; : :Another friend of Keita's from school.

The railway was mainly operated using a fleet of steam locomotives owned by the Corporation, with occasional assistance from locomotives borrowed from neighbouring railways. The dams were officially opened by King Edward VII on 21 July 1904, although construction continued until 1906. The railway connection with the Cambrian Railways line was reduced from a loop and double junction to a single junction in June 1908, as traffic reduced. The majority of the EVR was lifted by 1912, with the final main line track being removed in 1916. As of 1997, most of the line was walkable; and three such walks have been described.

Life and career Stowe was born in Natick, Massachusetts. His father died in 1808, leaving an impoverished widow with two sons. At the age of twelve, Stowe was apprenticed to a paper maker. Stowe had an insatiable craving for books, and acquired the rudiments of Latin by studying at odd moments during his apprenticeship in the paper mill. His earnest desire and determined efforts to gain an education attracted the attention of benefactors who sent him to an academy in Gorham, Maine. He later entered Bowdoin College, and graduated with honors in 1824. After his graduation from Bowdoin, he remained there for a year as an instructor and librarian. In September 1825, he entered Andover Theological Seminary. There, at the instigation of Moses Stuart, a professor, he completed a scholarly translation of Jahn's Hebrew Commonwealth (Andover, 1828; 2 vols., London, 1829). He graduated in 1828. In 1829, he became editor of the Boston Recorder, the oldest religious newspaper in the United States. In addition to his editorial labors, in 1829 he published a translation from the Latin, with notes, of Lowth's Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews. In 1830 he was appointed professor of Greek at Dartmouth College. In 1832 he married Eliza Tyler, daughter of Rev. Bennett Tyler, of Portland, Maine, and moved to Walnut Hills, near Cincinnati, Ohio, having been appointed professor of Biblical Literature at the new Lane Theological Seminary. Lyman Beecher was the president of the seminary; Stowe was mocked in the press for being Beecher's \\"satellite\\". In August 1834 his wife died childless, and in January 1836 he married Harriet Elizabeth Beecher, daughter of Lyman. They had seven children, four of whom died in Harriet's lifetime. He was an ardent critic of slavery, and the Stowes supported the Underground Railroad, temporarily housing several fugitive slaves in their home. While in Cincinnati, Stowe became an important advocate for the development of public schools in what was then the west of the United States, between the Appalachians and the Mississippi. He was critical in the establishment of the College of Teachers there in 1833. In May 1836 he sailed for England, primarily to purchase a library for the Lane Seminary, but he received at the same time an official appointment from the Ohio State Legislature to visit as agent the public schools of Europe, particularly those of Prussia. On his return he published Report on Elementary Education in Europe, which urged Ohio to adopt a state-backed educational system like that of Prussia. The Legislature ordered a copy of the book for each of the state's 8,500 school districts, and more copies were given to other state legislatures. He taught religion at Bowdoin from 1850 to 1852 and at Andover Theological Seminary from 1852 to 1864. While at Bowdoin, Harriet began writing her soon-to-be-acclaimed novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). In 1853 and 1856, he visited Europe with Harriet. In 1864, owing to failing health and increasing infirmities, he resigned his professorship and moved to Hartford, Connecticut. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1865.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory After Harriet's novel became world-known, Calvin wrote his own best-selling book, Origin and History of the Books of the Bible, both Canonical and Apocryphal (Hartford, 1867), one of the first books to examine the Bible from a historical perspective. He also published Introduction to the Criticism and Interpretation of the Bible (Cincinnati, 1835); The Religious Element in Education, a lecture (1844); and The Right Interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, inaugural address (Andover, 1853). His childhood stories served as the basis for Harriet's books Oldtown Folks (1869) and Sam Lawson's Old Fireside Stories (1872).

A location map  History Foundation to dissolution= Nysted Friary was founded in 1286 in the coastal town of Nysted on land donated by the lords of K√¶rstrup and Kjeldstrup farms. It was one of the earlier friaries in Denmark, under the jurisdiction of the Custody of Odense in the Franciscan Province of Dacia. It must have been one of the more prominent houses because the annual chapter meeting of the Franciscans in all of Scandinavia was held there six times between 1283 and 1415, but after that year it was only held there twice more, perhaps because other houses had become more important, and there were simply many more Franciscan establishments in the province. The friary was built just east of the town of Nysted in a traditional quadrilateral pattern with four wings around a central cloister, with a chapel forming one of the sides. The friary also had a hospital which kept a mortality book to record the deaths. While the book itself has not survived it is referred to in other documents. What makes this significant is that the hospital accommodated important members of the Danish court and noble families who were ill, among them bishop Valdemar Podebusk, Lyder Colbaltus Kabel, and Anders Sjundesen of K√¶rstrup, perhaps a descendant of the founders of the friary. In the late 15th century the Franciscans at Nysted were divided by the ongoing conflict that regularly plagued the entire Franciscan order, over how strictly they should interpret the original Rule of Saint Francis, and especially the vow of poverty. The Observants insisted that the monks should conform to the strict rule, and so should avoid owning property and wealth. The Conventuals argued for a more liberal interpretation of the rule, and for a little more comfort as the friary's wealth and income increased. In 1477 the conflict came to a head when the Observants beat up the Conventuals and threw them out of the friary. Two years later the Conventuals in their turn chased the Observants out with cudgels. In time the rift healed, but the stricter interpretation of the rule was enforced until the Reformation. In 1483 the friary sold off two of its properties to Herr Eskil G√∏je. The next year the friary sold its remaining smaller properties including a smallholding and a field in nearby towns. The single most important document remaining is the Nysted Martyrology, a list of saints' days for the entire year. It was lost during the dissolution of the friary until 1959, when it was located in a library in The Hague in the Netherlands. It is one of only four surviving from the entire medieval period in Denmark. =Dissolution= The Reformation brought an end to Nysted Friary. Frederik I and his son, Duke Christian, later Christian III, ordered the closure of Franciscan houses in 28 Danish towns beginning in 1527. Just two years later Nysted was the last one remaining. Many Danes vented their anger against the Catholic Church on the most visible representatives, the multiple monastic houses which were to be found in towns of any importance. The Franciscans were targeted first because their constant appeals for food, clothing, money, and labor seemed an added burden to the tithes, fees, and rents already paid to the church by Danish peasants. The tragic circumstances of the expulsion by force of the Franciscans town by town were recorded by a Franciscan friar in \\"Kr√∏nike om Gr√•br√∏drenes Udjagelse af Danmark\\" (\\"The Chronicles of the Hounding-out of the Gray Friars from Denmark\\"). A story recorded about Nysted Friary at the time is that when the local district governor was required to make an inventory of its valuables, four gilded silver chalices, four gilded cups, and three small white silver spoons were missing, as the friars had buried their valuables to be retrieved in better times, but the governor demanded their return and confiscated them. Unlike many other places, the Franciscans were able to remain in the friary until 1538. In fact it was the last outpost of the Franciscans in Denmark. Denmark became officially Lutheran in October 1536 when Christian III and the State Council adopted the . Nysted Friary remained open until 1538 when the last monk, Lutke Naamensen, is recorded as still there. Later that same year the friary was closed. =After dissolution= The buildings were ordered to be demolished in 1551, when two of the bells from the chapel were taken down and re-hung in Nysted parish church. In 1577 the ruins could still be seen, but from that time on, the stone and bricks were carried off for the construction of local buildings. As late as 1800 over 1,000 wagonloads of brick and stone were removed from the site, so that now even the foundation stones have vanished. Excavations in the 1920s by the National Museum of Denmark found the site and a few burials. Perhaps the most important find was the seal of Chancellor Valdemar Podebusk who became a Franciscan before his death and burial at Nysted. The site has been reused for modern building purposes.

BURN-E is first seen briefly as a welder robot in WALL-E when WALL-E and EVE fly around the Axiom starliner, and enter through a door, locking him outside the ship. BURN-E is seen banging his fists against the door, and ultimately realizing that he has been locked out. Plot While clinging to the ship carrying EVE back to the Axiom as shown in the original film, WALL-E runs his hand through the rings of Saturn. One rock particle gains enough speed to become a meteorite, which collides with a running light on the Axiom and destroys it. Seeing this, AUTO activates the supply unit SUPPLY-R (Spare Ultra Plottic Pandron Yorth-Ranger) and dispatches the welding robot BURN-E to repair the damage. BURN-E shuts off the power supply to the broken light and gets a new one from SUPPLY-R, but while he is preparing to weld it in place, EVE's ship docks with the Axiom; distracted by the arrival and WALL-E's wave, BURN-E lets the new light float off into space. SUPPLY-R reluctantly gives BURN-E another light, and BURN-E begins to install it as WALL-E is launched away from the ship in an escape pod set to self-destruct. The explosion of the pod startles BURN-E into slicing through the base of the light with his blowtorch, destroying it. Annoyed by this second failure, SUPPLY-R drops his last spare light on the floor in front of BURN-E, who successfully installs it. As he finishes, WALL-E and EVE fly back into the Axiom after their dance in space and the hatch closes behind them, locking BURN-E out, as seen in the original movie. Some time later, an airlock opens to jettison garbage and nearly ejects WALL-E and EVE as well; BURN-E hurries to the airlock, but it closes again before he can reach it. Still later, while playing with his blowtorch, BURN-E realizes that he can use it to cut through the hatch and re-enter the Axiom. Once inside, he prepares to restore power to the repaired light, but the fight between Captain McCrea and AUTO causes the ship to lift and send BURN-E sliding out through the hole he cut. As he grabs hold of the light to avoid being thrown into space, McCrea shuts down AUTO and manually rights the ship for its hyperspace return to Earth, triggered by the plant WALL-E found. The speed of the journey pins BURN-E against the hull until the Axiom lands on Earth, after which he finds it deserted. Spotting SUPPLY-R through the window of an escape pod, he accidentally launches it which he is inside to slam into the ground. Un-hatching the pod, he turns on the light and begins to celebrate, only for the hatch to crush it. Frustrated, BURN-E collapses among the newly returned humans and robots. In a post-credits scene, SUPPLY-R consoles BURN-E by patting him on the head and saying \\"There, there\\" in a dull monotone.

Ernest Pike \\"La Donna e mobile\\" from \\"Rigoletto\\" (1905‚Äì1908). Ernest George Pike (1871 ‚Äì 4 March 1936) was an English tenor of the early 20th century. After studying at the Guildhall School of Music in London, he worked as a bank clerk and sang as a church tenor before making his first recording \\"Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes\\" for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company in 1904. He became the house tenor for HMV and made several hundred records in a career that spanned over twenty years. Pike has been called \\"England's most recorded tenor\\", and his \\"silver voice\\" became a favourite in thousands of homes ‚Äì remaining so until well into the 1920s. For a time his popularity was as great as that of the singer Peter Dawson. His repertoire was varied and included grand opera, light opera, oratorio, and ballads and popular songs of the Edwardian era, the First World War and the 1920s. He toured the British Isles giving concerts and was a favourite of royalty. He recorded under a number of pseudonyms ‚Äì most commonly Herbert Payne. Early career Ernest Pike was born in Pimlico, London, England in 1871 the son of Richard Pike, a builder. As a young tenor he sang in several choirs. In 1887 at the age of 16 and using the pseudonym Herbert Payne, he toured with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's \\"B\\" Company playing one of the ghosts of the ancestors in Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore. He went on to study at the Guildhall School of Music in London for two years before continuing his musical studies privately. After completing his studies in the early 1890s, Pike worked as a clerk for a bank in Victoria, London; he became a shorthand writing expert and taught his skill to other employees. Sometime during the 1890s he was appointed principal tenor at Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, London - a post that he still held in 1903. He also sang at The Spanish Church (St. James), Spanish Place, Marylebone, London. The church singing was done in his free time while he worked at the bank during the day. His profession was still that of a commercial clerk when he married May Stevens in 1900. They had a daughter Maud who was born in 1901. He soon began to receive invitations to sing at the London Ballad Concerts which were held at the Queen's Hall and Royal Albert Hall in London. He also started to receive many offers of provincial engagements. With a now busy concert schedule and the start of his recording career in 1904, he was able to resign his post at Holy Trinity Sloane Square (in c. 1904). In January 1905 he performed for King Edward VII at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire for three nights in succession when the King was in residence for a visit to the Devonshire Hospital in Buxton. The 1913 Zonophone record catalogue described him as \\"The late King Edward's favourite tenor\\". During the Edwardian era he toured the country singing in many leading cities and towns. In 1909 he sang in Handel's Acis and Galatea at a Henry Wood Promenade concert in London. By the 1911 census the family was living in Balham, South London and his profession was given as that of a singer. Recording career In April 1904 Pike made his first recording: \\"Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes\\" (from Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers) for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company (G&T;); it was released as a gramophone record (disc) in August of that year. From 1906 many of his recordings were released on the Gramophone Company's Zonophone label but he also released on Columbia, Ariel and Duophone. In addition, he recorded 2-minute Edison cylinders in 1907 starting with \\"When the Berry's on the Holly\\", 4-minute Edison cylinders 1908‚Äì1910 starting with \\"Always\\", Sterling cylinders c. 1907 and Path√© discs in 1908 starting with \\"I'll Sing Thee Songs of Araby\\". After 1922 he ceased to record for HMV and recorded only for Columbia's budget Regal label. Between the early 1900s and the mid-1920s Pike recorded more than 2,400 matrixes (takes) for HMV. Assuming an average of three takes per song, this would equate to approximately 400 double-sided 78rpm gramophone records for HMV alone. An estimate of the total count of all his recordings (discs and cylinders) has put the figure at well over 500. He has been called \\"England's most recorded tenor\\" with his records of popular ballads becoming favourites in thousands of homes. For a time his popularity was as great as that of Peter Dawson. By the First World War he had become the house tenor for HMV. Pike used many different pseudonyms the greatest number being for his Zonophone recordings. These are listed as follows with associated record companies in brackets if used for companies other than HMV. Any variations in pseudonym are also shown in brackets: Herbert Payne (Zonophone, G&T; and some Edisons), Harold Payne, David Boyd (shared with Harold Wilde), Arthur Brett, Eric Courtland (Columbia), Arthur Gray (or Arthur Grey), Alan Dale (or Allan Dale), Richard Pembroke, Jack Henty, Sam Hovey, Arthur Adams, Arthur Edwards (or Arthur Edwardes), Edgar Froome (Ariel), Charles Nelson, Billy Murray and J. Saunders. He was the Murray of \\"Murray & Denton\\", \\"Murray & Fay\\" and \\"Strong & Murray\\" and Cobbett in \\"Cobbett & Walker\\" (with Stanley Kirkby). He was Bernard Moss in some duets with Peter Dawson. =Operatic recordings= Pike sang in the earliest and often incomplete recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan (G&S;) and other light operas of the era. In December 1906 he shared the role of Nanki-Poo in the first recording of The Mikado. This was released on single-sided gramophone records by G&T; then re-released on double-sided discs by HMV in 1912. He shared the role of Sir Joseph Porter on the first recording of the G&S; opera H.M.S. Pinafore which was recorded by the Russell Hunting company on eleven Edison cylinders in 1907. In 1999 these early cylinders were re-discovered after they had been thought lost. He probably sang Marco in The Gondoliers (1907 for G&T;) - credit being given to the \\"Sullivan Operatic Party\\" and not to individual artists for this recording. He sang both Colonel Fairfax and Leonard Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1907 for G&T;) and Ralph Rackstraw in the 1908 (Gramophone Company) recording of H.M.S. Pinafore. Ernest Pike (standing, fourth from left, counting the conductor) at one of the recording sessions for The Pirates of Penzance in 1920 Between 1908 and 1910 Pike sang on a small series of grand opera recordings which were released on the Zonophone white label, for example he recorded \\"Miserere\\" from Il Trovatore in 1908 and \\"La Donna √® Mobile\\" from Rigoletto in 1910, both by Verdi and both recorded with Eleanor Jones-Hudson as Alveena Yarrow. In 1909 he recorded \\"Solenne in Quest'ora\\" (in English) from Verdi's The Force of Destiny with Peter Dawson. In 1917 after lengthy negotiations with Rupert D'Oyly Carte, HMV was granted permission to do a series of complete recordings of G&S; operas. To retain the authenticity of the stage performances, these recordings were to be directly overseen by Rupert D'Oyly Carte.Shepherd, Marc. \\"The First D'Oyly Carte Recordings\\", Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 18 November 2001, accessed 18 October 2012 Pike was one of the chosen singers along with Peter Dawson, Derek Oldham, George Baker, Stanley Kirkby, Robert Radford, Edna Thornton, Violet Essex, Sarah Jones and Bessie Jones. Pike shared the singing of both Nanki-Poo and Pish Tush in The Mikado (1917); sang Luiz, Francesco and parts of Marco in The Gondoliers (1919), and Leonard Meryll and the First Yeoman in The Yeomen of the Guard (1920). He sang the Duke of Dunstable in Patience (1921). In 1918 he sang Silas Simkins in HMV's complete recording of Merrie England by Edward German. In the acoustic recording era it was accepted practice for recordings to be made by \\"studio singers\\" (in this case provided by HMV) rather than by the singers who would have performed the same roles in stage productions. By 1922 Carte was insisting that his company's own singers be allowed to perform in the recordings, a move that prevented Pike and several others from singing further solo parts. In Iolanthe (1922), Pike was relegated to the chorus. After this he did not participate in any further recordings of G&S; operas made by HMV. =Popular recordings= Pike is probably best remembered for his prolific output of the popular songs of his day. He became well known for his recordings of First World War songs, for example the American song \\"There's a Long Long Trail\\" in 1916 and \\"Take me Back to Dear Old Blighty\\" (as Eric Courtland) in a duet with George Baker (as Walter Jeffries) in 1917; he also made one of the earliest recordings of the famous ballad \\"Roses of Picardy\\" in 1918 shortly after it had been written. He collaborated with other well-known artists, for example with Peter Dawson in Dawson's recording of \\"The Lost Chord\\" made in 1907 and with Stanley Kirkby in \\"When You Wore a Tulip\\" in 1916 (as Cobbett and Walker) and \\"She Sells Sea Shells on the Seashore\\" in 1908 (as Herbert Payne with Fred Cooper). Occasionally he would form part of a backing group or chorus in the recording studio known as \\"The Minster Singers\\" along with some or all of the following: Stanley Kirkby, Eleanor Jones-Hudson, Peter Dawson and Thorpe Bates; sometimes there were additional singers in this group. The Minster Singers also recorded songs in its own right, for example \\"In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree\\" in 1906. Below is a selection of some of Pike's solo songs which typify the popular repertoire that he recorded for HMV. The year of recording and any pseudonyms used are also given: * \\"Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes\\", 1904 * \\"When the Sunset Turns the Ocean's Blue to Gold\\", 1906 (as Arthur Brett) * \\"In My Aeroplane for Two\\", 1907 (as Herbert Payne) * \\"Killarney\\", 1908 (as Pike). 1907 and 1912 (as Herbert Payne) * \\"When You Know You're Not Forgotten (by the Girl You Can't Forget)\\", 1907 (as Herbert Payne) * \\"Ayesha, My Sweet Egyptian\\", 1909 (as Herbert Payne) * \\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\", 1913 (as Herbert Payne) * \\"The Sunshine of Your Smile\\", 1914 (as Herbert Payne) * \\"When the War Is Over Mother Dear\\", 1915 (as Herbert Payne) * \\"There's a Long Long Trail\\", 1915 * \\"Roses of Picardy\\", 1918 * \\"Hello New York\\", 1918 Singing voice Pike was a lyric tenor but had difficulty beginning with the top A and, although he could go higher, he tended to avoid the higher tenor notes. In his memoirs the producer and recording engineer Fred Gaisberg remembered Pike as a \\"silver-voiced tenor\\". The singer George Baker said of Pike: \\"He had a smooth tenor voice that was easy to record because of its even quality\\". However, Baker also thought Pike's style to be \\"unemotional\\". Death He died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 4 March 1936, aged 64 in Streatham, South London.

It was released on May 8, 2001 for Fharmacy Recordings and featured production from MC Breed, Jazze Pha, The D.O.C., Dog, Corey Peterson and Gee Pierce. By the time this album was released, Breed's popularity had greatly decreased, thus the album did not make it to the Billboard charts. His single \\"Let's Go To The Club\\" received massive airplay in his native Detroit area, but not as much elsewhere. It is his most successful single since 1991's \\"Ain't No Future in Yo Frontin'\\". On September 17, 2001, \\"Let's Go to the Club\\" broke the record for any other Detroit radio airplays.

His surname is sometimes spelled Darkschewitsch in medical literature. From 1882 to 1887 he studied medicine at the University of Moscow, and afterwards worked and studied at the laboratory of Theodor Meynert (1833-1892) in Vienna, the laboratory of Paul Flechsig (1847-1929) in Leipzig, Carl Westphal's clinic in Berlin, and at the Salp√™tri√®re in the clinic of Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893). During this time period, he also collaborated with Joseph Jules Dejerine (1839-1917) and Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) on a number of important medical papers. From 1892 to 1917 Darkshevich was director of the department of neurology at the University of Kazan, where he founded a neurological clinic and laboratory. He was the first editor-in-chief of the Kazan Medical Journal (–ö–∞–∑–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª). In 1917 he became a professor of neurological diseases at the University of Moscow. He is remembered for his description of the nucleus of the posterior commissure, also known as the \\"nucleus of Darkshevich\\", defined as a cell group located in the central gray substance of the upper end of the cerebral aqueduct, in front of the oculomotor nucleus.

Big Walker Lookout Inside the lookout tower looking up at the stairs from the bottom.  Location  The tower is accessed from the Big Walker General Store, just off US Route 52 about 12 miles from Wytheville, Virginia. The first store building burned in 2003 and a new store was built just to the right of the first.http://www.scenicbeauty-va.com/photo.htm Originally, visitors crossed to the tower by way of a swinging bridge that connected to the back of the old general store. The swinging bridge was not destroyed in the fire and still stands. Visitors can cross to the edge where the original staircase connected to the bridge. Big Walker Lookout hosts traditional arts demonstrations on weekends. The lookout tower is open to the public with payment of an admission fee.  Views  Located at an elevation of 3405 feet, the view from the top of the tower encompasses mountain peaks in five different states.  History  The tower was originally built in 1947 and has been run continuously by the Kime family. According to the Virginia Department of Tourism, the tower is located at a mountain pass used by Molly Tynes, a woman who warned the town of Wytheville of impending raids by John Toland during the Civil War. The tower is the beginning of a Virginia Civil War Trails driving tour detailing the Battle of Wytheville, which occurred on July 18, 1863 when \\"a Federal raiding party marched to the Wytheville area intending to destroy the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad tracks and bridges\\". Troops also hoped to destroy key telegraph lines and damage nearby salt mines and lead mines. Thanks in part to the warnings brought by Tynes, the battle was largely unsuccessful for the Union forces. \\"After some skirmishing and confusion on the advance, Union Col. John Toland ordered his men into Wytheville. Hastily organized Confederate resistance succeeded in killing Toland in the street and limiting the damage to the railroad track and stock. The raid did not succeed in its mission as the track was quickly repaired\\".  Wildlife  Big Walker Lookout Tower is a stop on Virginia Birding and Wildlife Trail's Big Walker Loop. Birds sighted at the Big Walker Lookout include: wild turkey; black vultures; bald eagles and golden eagles; American kestrels; peregrine falcons; and sharp-shinned, Cooper's hawks, broad-winged, and red-tailed hawks.
