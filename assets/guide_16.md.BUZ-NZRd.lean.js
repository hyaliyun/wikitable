From 1808 to 1814 Wreningham hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain which connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth. Superstitions Wreningham, allegedly, got its name from the Witch and the Wren myth. The myth tells the story of a witch living in Wreningham who was discovered by the villagers. A knight then came to kill her and upon being attacked she transformed herself into a wren to escape safely; in response the villagers beat the bushes with sticks and caught and burnt any wrens that flew out in an attempt to kill her. She supposedly returns to the village every St Stephen's Day, and traditionally the villagers would beat the hedges and burn any wrens they caught on this day. References * Ordnance Survey (1999).

The ITSD was first published as an electronic resource on a series of three CD-ROMs in April 2005. It was updated in July 2006 and completely revised in May 2009 and released on a single DVD totalling some 3.68 GB of data and images. The ITSD has been designed as a free access academic tool to promote and facilitate undergraduate and postgraduate research into the species. It can be accessed through the offices of the curators and heads of department of the universities and museums that hold thylacine material or alternatively through the libraries of several of the major zoological societies. The ITSD lists all available catalogue data for each individual specimen e.g. holding institution, catalogue identification number, sex, date of acquisition, specimen type, source, locality, collector, field number, old or additional catalogue numbers, purchase or exchange information and finally any additional remarks pertaining to the specimen. To support the data component and to significantly enhance its educational worth, high-resolution digital images of the specimens are included. The ITSD specimen image bank forms the largest single photographic resource of its kind anywhere in the world. The primary justification for including digital images was to: #Give researchers remote visual access to thylacine specimen material and to the accompanying data thus encouraging and promoting continued research into the species. #Conserve source specimen material from excessive handling hence directly contributing to its long-term conservation. #Assist with the security of source material in that a photographic record exists for all specimens within the database. #Preserve digital images of the specimens in their current state of preservation. Specimen material within the ITSD comprises skins, skeletons, skulls, taxidermy mounts and wet specimens. Wet specimens are whole animals, organs or body parts that have been preserved in either alcohol or formalin. Specimens of the thylacine are spread extensively around the globe so the search to locate these specimens was from the outset an international search involving a total of 106 museum, university and private collections in 23 countries. The master copy of the ITSD is held at the Zoological Society in London with mirror copies held within the University of Tasmania in Hobart, the Australian National Wildlife Collection in Canberra and the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston. The master and mirror copies are kept constantly revised and updated as new information comes to light. The Zoological Society was chosen to hold the master copy of the ITSD because of its historic association with the thylacine. The bulk of the early scientific papers on the species were published within its \\"Proceedings\\" and the society's zoo in Regent's Park exhibited more thylacines than any other zoo outside Australia. Each year the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales hosts the Whitley Awards. These awards are a tribute to Gilbert Whitley, the eminent Australian ichthyologist and are presented for outstanding publications that contain a significant amount of new information relating to the fauna of the Australasian region. In September 2005 the International Thylacine Specimen Database was awarded the Whitley Award for the best zoological database. This was the first time in the history of the awards that a Whitley citation had been presented for a database. References *Australian Zoologist 33: 419.

The province has an area of and a population of 221,496 distributed across seven communes (Spanish: comunas). The provincial capital is the city of Osorno. Osorno is a city located in southern Chile a territory of northern Patagonia in the Los Lagos Region. The Chilean Patagonia starts at Latitude 39° South in Valdivia and then it continues through the Chiloe Island and the fiords that continue its course south through the Pacific Ocean and the Cordillera de los Andes until it reaches Latitude 56° South at Cape Horn.The province possesses one of the most frequented mountain passes of Chile, the Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass which links the province with Villa La Angostura and San Carlos de Bariloche in Argentina. Administration As a province, Osorno is a second-level administrative division, governed by a provincial governor who is appointed by the president. The Osorno Province comprises seven communes; each commune is governed by its own municipality, headed by an alcalde. =Communes= *Osorno *Puerto Octay *Purranque *Puyehue *Río Negro *San Pablo *San Juan de la Costa History The first inhabitants of the area were the indigenous Huilliche people. Osorno also featured largely in German Colonization in Chile, which took place in the 19th century, when the Chilean government brought German settlers to assist in the growth of the region.  Ethnocultural demography The Osorno province owes its legacy to fairly recent Chilean settlement, when the government subdued the region's indigenous Mapuche peoples in the mid-19th century and opened the land to Chilean and European immigration soon to follow. Large percentage of locals in Osorno are descendants of Spanish (the livestock grazing industry owes its foundation to the Basques) and other European immigrants. In Osorno, there are historic ties and bonds with the Dutch, British esp. Scots with some Irish and English, French, Germans including Austrians and Swiss, Italians, Portuguese, ex-Yugoslavians, Greeks and from the Middle East are Arabs and Palestinians. These ethnic groups came in the late 19th century and early 20th century period. Around 1850, the government of Chile began inviting German settlers to the colony to promote growth in the region; the settlers found Osorno's climate and geography to be very similar to their own. With their help, Osorno was made the home of the national cattle ranch of Chile, boosting the regional economy significantly. Present-day Osorno has preserved 19th-century architecture and urban layout, represented by six houses which have been designated national monuments. Economic activity The main economic activity in the province is livestock, Osorno being one of the most important agricultural centers of Chile, which is identified with the slogan \\"Land of Milk and Meat of Chile\\". Another important economic activity is tourism. =Tourist attractions= Tourist destinations in the province includes the: *Lake and mountainous communes of Puerto Octay and Puyehue, where the German migrated influence is evident; mainly in construction and catering. The main tourist attractions in the area are its lakes: Llanquihue, Puyehue and Rupanco with multiple beaches each; Puyehue National Park (tourist centre which has the Hot spring and Baths of Puyehue and Aguas Calientes; and Antillanca ski resort). *Communes central of Osorno and San Pablo, where Osorno city identifies itself with the slogan \\"City-Park of Chile\\". Osorno city is also a tourist centre in the province. *Coastal communes of Purranque, Rio Negro and San Juan de la Costa, presenting a wide coastal area, rich in natural resources, and ecotourism and ethnotourism. Attractions include the beaches at Pucatrihue and Maicolpue. Also this zone presents wildlife reserves created by the original inhabitants of ethnic Huilliche, such as the Network of Community Parks Mapu Lahual, associated with marine and coastal protected area Lafken Mapu Lahual.

At the 30th Academy Awards in 1958 (where it was nominated for Best Song), Mathis performed the song live.  Nina Simone  Nina Simone first recorded \\"Wild Is the Wind\\" live in 1959; this version appearing on the album Nina Simone at Town Hall. Her most famous interpretation of the song was a studio recording released on the compilation album Wild Is the Wind (1966), made of songs recorded for two earlier album projects. Simone reworked the song with slow, sparse instrumentation, stretching the vocal delivery to express soulful, hopeless loss.https://www.npr.org/2015/07/06/419252433/first-listen-nina-revisited-a- tribute-to-nina-simoneHow Nina Simone transformed Wild is the Wind into an enduring ballad - Financial Times (March 6, 2017) Simone's 1966 version appeared on the trailer for the 2008 movie Revolutionary Road.

Bowie was an admirer of Simone’s style, and after meeting her in Los Angeles in 1975, he was inspired to record the song for his album. Bowie later said that Simone's version \\"really affected me... I recorded it as an hommage to Nina.\\" This was the only cover song released by Bowie during this period of his career; he wrote or co-wrote the other songs on his albums. Bowie took special care with the contemporary rock arrangement and production of \\"Wild Is the Wind\\", committing to an emotional and romantic vocal performance, the words drawn out more slowly and with a greater sense of loss, following the 1966 Simone version rather than the Mathis original. =Promotional video= To promote the 1981 compilation album Changestwobowie, a black and white promotional video was made, directed by David Mallet. It featured Bowie and four musicians miming to the studio recording, including Tony Visconti (double bass), Coco Schwab (guitar), Mel Gaynor (drums), and Andy Hamilton (saxophone).

In Norwegian these boats were called missilkanonbåter (MKB) meaning boats with missiles and guns. They were operated by the Coastal Combat Flotilla together with the MTBs, or missile torpedo boats. None of the boats are currently in service with the Royal Norwegian Navy. The design was Norwegian and all of the boats were built by Norwegian ship yards from 1965 to 1967.  Design  The Storm class was designed by Lieutenant-Commander (later Captain) Harald Henriksen. The same man was also involved in the design of the Rapp-class motor torpedo boats - the first Norwegian-built MTBs. Later, he also designed the Snøgg- and Hauk- class MTBs.

History  Brandon Gray began the site on August 7, 1998 making forecasts of the top 10 highest-grossing films in the United States for the following weekend. To compare his forecasts to the actual results, he started posting the weekend grosses and wrote a regular column with box office analysis and in 1999, he started to post the Friday daily box office grosses, sourced from Exhibitor Relations, so that they were publicly available for free online on Saturdays and posted the Sunday weekend estimates on Sundays. As well as the weekend grosses, he was publishing the daily grosses, release schedules as well as other charts, such as all-time charts, international box office charts, genre charts, actor and director charts. The site gradually expanded to include weekend charts going back to 1982 and grosses for older films and the international section expanded to cover the weekly box office of 50 countries, international release schedules as well as box office results from up to 107 countries.

Both Cyt, Ron and Cytron can use various weapons, and there are computer terminals in various places in the mazes, allowing access to various facilities.

It is also called High Mass or Solemn High Mass. However, in the United States the term \\"High Mass\\" is also used to describe the less elaborate Missa Cantata, which lacks deacon and subdeacon and some of the ceremonies connected with them. These terms distinguish the form in question from that of Low Mass and Missa Cantata. The parts assigned to the deacon and subdeacon are often done by priests in vestments proper to those roles. A Solemn Mass celebrated by a bishop has its own particular ceremonies and is referred to as a Solemn Pontifical Mass.  Non-Tridentine Solemn Mass  In the 21st century, the term \\"solemn Mass\\", capitalized or not, is increasingly used instead of an analogous celebration in the post- Vatican II form of the Roman Rite of Mass, in which case it has been defined as \\"a high Mass in which the priest is assisted by two deacons\\".Edward E. Schaefer, Catholic Music Through the Ages: Balancing the Needs of a Worshipping Church (Liturgy Training Publications, 2008), p. 18 The functions that the two deacons carry out are indicated in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal and the 1989 edition of the Ceremonial of Bishops,Diocese of Superior, The Deacon at Mass The terms \\"Solemn Mass\\", \\"Solemn High Mass\\" and \\"High Mass\\" are also often used within Anglo-Catholicism, in which the ceremonial, and sometimes the text, are based on those of the Sarum Rite or the later Tridentine Mass. Lutherans (mainly in Europe) sometimes use the term \\"High Mass\\" to describe a more solemn form of their Divine Service, generally celebrated in a manner similar to that of Roman Catholics. Examples of similarities include vestments, chanting, and incense. Lutheran congregations in North America commonly celebrate High Mass more or less,Lutheran Service Book, Divine Service Setting I, III but rarely use the term \\"Mass\\".Mass in the Christian Cyclopedia. This article deals only with Tridentine Solemn Mass as regulated by the rubrics of editions of the Roman Missal published between the Council of Trent and the Second Vatican Council.  Importance within Tridentine Mass  Solemn or High Mass is the full form of Tridentine Mass and elements of the abbreviated forms can be explained only in its light: :This high Mass is the norm; it is only in the complete rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood. Thus, the rubrics of the Ordinary of the Mass always suppose that the Mass is high. Low Mass, said by a priest alone with one server, is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing. Its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high Mass. For instance, the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the Gospel, because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high Mass; he turns round always by the right, because at high Mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on.Adrian Fortescue, \\"Liturgy of the Mass\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia 1910. Since its 1970 revision, the Roman Missal no longer categorizes Mass as High or Low (in Latin, solemnis or lecta), and distinguishes MassGeneral Instruction of the Roman Missal, chapter IV: The Different Forms of Celebrating Mass only as celebrated with a congregationGeneral Instruction of the Roman Missal, 115–198 (with a subdivision according as it is celebrated with or without a deacon)General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 120–186 or with participation by only one minister,General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 252–272 and as celebrated with or without concelebrating priests.General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 199–251 It recommends singing at all Masses, saying, for instance: \\"Although it is not always necessary (e.g., in weekday Masses) to sing all the texts that are of themselves meant to be sung, every care should be taken that singing by the ministers and the people is not absent in celebrations that occur on Sundays and on holy days of obligation\\";General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 40 and: \\"It is very appropriate that the priest sing those parts of the Eucharistic Prayer for which musical notation is provided.\\"General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 147 The distinction between High and Low Mass is necessarily observed where the Tridentine form of the Roman Rite continues to be used. The term \\"High Mass\\" is sometimes encountered also, both in Anglican and certain Roman Catholic circles, to describe any Mass celebrated with greater solemnity.  Vestments  In the sacristy, before vesting, all three sacred ministers (priest celebrant, deacon, and subdeacon) wash their hands. The sacred ministers recite certain prayers while they place on each vestment. First, the amice (a rectangular cloth of linen with long strings for tying) is kissed (if it is embroidered with a cross) and then placed on top of the head briefly while reciting one of the prayers during vesting. Then it is tied around the shoulders on top of the cassock (or on top of the habit, if the sacred ministers belongs to a religious order with one). Next the alb (a long linen tunic with sleeves) is put on. The cincture (in Latin, cinctura), a long cloth cord also called a girdle, is then tied around the waist. The subdeacon then completes his vesting by placing the maniple (an embroidered piece of fabric, folded in half, with a cross in the middle) on his left arm (provided there is no Asperges or other liturgical ceremony before Mass begins), securing it either with pins or with the ribbons or elastic inside, and then the tunicle (an embroidered tunic with short sleeves) over all. The deacon places his stole (a long narrow embroidered piece of cloth, similar to the maniple but of greater length) over his left shoulder and binds it in place, at his right hip, with the cincture or girdle. He then puts on the maniple and his dalmatic (similar to the tunicle). The priest celebrant does the same except that he crosses his stole in front of him at the waist, binding it with the girdle or cincture. After the maniple he puts on a cope (a long, heavy embroidered cape) if the Mass is preceded by the Asperges (sprinkling the congregation with holy water). Following the Asperges, the celebrant, assisted by the acolytes, removes the cope and puts on the chasuble (similar to the tunicle, but without sleeves and usually with an embroidered cross or image on the back). The servers of the Mass (Master of Ceremonies, acolytes, thurifer, torch-bearers) and the clergy sitting in the liturgical choir stalls are vested in cassock (the ankle-length black robe with buttons, usually seen on priests and altar servers) and surplice (a flowing white tunic with sleeves) or cotta (a shorter version of the surplice), though in some places acolytes wore simple albs and cinctures instead. Anyone ordained to the subdiaconate or above also wears the biretta (a four-cornered hat with perhaps a pom-pom on top in the center and three fins on top around the edges) while sitting. Members of religious orders in habit have on a surplice over the habit. If it is part of their \\"choir dress\\", they also use the biretta. If not, then they use their hood in the same fashion as one uses a biretta. Birettas are plain black for priests, deacons and subdeacons, purple or black with purple or red trim for monsignori, canons, bishops and archbishops; cardinals' birettas are scarlet.  Music  The typical music of Solemn Mass is Gregorian chant. However, a wide variety of musical settings of the Ordinary of the Mass have been composed over the centuries, and may be used instead. The polyphonic works of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Giovanni Gabrieli are considered especially suitable. There are also several musical settings for the propers of Masses during seasons and on feast days and for certain votive Masses. An example is William Byrd's setting of the minor propers for the Lady Mass in Advent. Despite discouragement, more than a century ago, by Pope Pius X in Tra le Sollecitudine (1903) of the selection of post-Renaissance compositions often considered to be \\"sacred music\\", musical settings for the Ordinary of the Mass by composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart continue in use. Being based on texts in Latin, these settings, as well as the earlier ones, are less frequently met today. The music of the Mass is typically performed by a choir. The Ordinary is theoretically designated for the whole congregation, whereas the Propers are proper to the choir of clerics in attendance. In practice, even the Ordinary is often too complicated for the congregation, and the choir is often made up of specially trained lay men and women (though in churches run by religious orders it is often made up of their members.) The choir, at least if clerical, was traditionally placed close to the altar in stalls. However, with the appearance of elaborate musical settings of the Ordinary of the Mass it became necessary to employ lay singers, and with this innovation, the choir moved first from the front of the church up to galleries on the sides of the church and then finally to a loft in the back. This in turn allowed musical instruments, besides the organ, to be employed in the music. In Solemn Mass, by far the greater part is spoken by the celebrant inaudibly, but, apart from a very few parts such as the \\"Orate Fratres\\", all that he speaks aloud, such as \\"Dominus vobiscum\\" and the four opening words of the Gloria and of the Creed are sung by him. He says quietly for himself everything that the choir sings, except short responses such as \\"Et cum spiritu tuo\\" and \\"Amen\\". He reads for himself the words of the Epistle and the following chants while the subdeacon sings the Epistle, and he reads the Gospel for himself before the deacon sings the Gospel aloud.  Structure and ceremonial The ceremonies begin when the Master of Ceremonies (MC) rings the bell. The porter opens the sacristy door and the servers and ministers leave the sacristy and enter the church in the following manner: first the thurifer carrying his thurible and boat (or the aspersorium if the Asperges is to be had); next come the acolytes carrying their candles (the custom in Northern European and English-speaking countries is to have a crucifer holding a processional cross walking between the acolytes); the Master of Ceremonies comes next; and finally the three sacred ministers enter in single file in reverse order of precedence (or on either side of the celebrant if he is wearing the cope for the Asperges or some other ceremony before the Mass. The deacon and sub-deacon should be holding the ends of the cope.) *Asperges (only on Sundays at the principal Mass of the day). The Asperges is only of obligation in cathedral and collegiate churches, but it was required by the bishops of England for all parish churches. This ceremony of sprinkling the congregation with lustral water is performed by the celebrant with the assistance of the other sacred ministers. After blessing the altar, himself, and the sacred ministers and servers, the celebrant then proceeds through the nave of the church to bless the congregation. All the while the choir, or a cantor, is singing the text from Psalm 50, verse 9 (all Biblical references from here on are from the Douay-Rheims Bible) \\"Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.\\" After the sacred ministers have returned to the altar a few verses and responses are sung between the celebrant and everyone else. The sacred ministers then go to the sedilia (the bench or seats where the sacred ministers sit during parts of the Mass) to put on their maniples and to help the celebrant change from cope to chasuble. *Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. These prayers are said by the sacred ministers standing on the floor at the bottom of the steps leading up to the High Altar. They are also said to each other, kneeling, by the acolytes and those servers sitting in the liturgical choir. If the acolytes are close enough, they may say them with the sacred ministers. These prayers consist primarily of Psalm 42 with the verses said alternately between the celebrant and the other sacred ministers. While these prayers are being said, the musical choir is singing the text of the Introit. After the prayers are finished, all rise. The sacred ministers ascend the steps to the altar to cense it. *Introit. This text of the Mass varies daily. It usually consists of Scriptural or religious text, followed by a Psalm verse, followed by the Doxology. Then the Scriptural or religious text is repeated. This is usually being sung while the sacred ministers are saying the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar mentioned above and while they incense the altar. After Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, the sacred ministers ascend the steps to the altar, the thurifer brings his thurible, or censer, and a 'boat' of incense. The celebrant places incense into the thurible, blesses it and then proceeds to cense the altar, accompanied by the other ministers. After he is finished, he hands the thurible to the deacon and the deacon censes him. The thurible is then given back to the thurifer, who departs to the sacristy until he is needed again. The sacred ministers then form a \\"semicircle\\" (really a line) on the altar steps—the celebrant on the top platform (called a footpace), the deacon on a middle step, and the sub-deacon on the bottom step. The Master of Ceremonies then helps the celebrant find his place in the Missal. The priest makes the sign of the cross and recites in a low voice to himself the Introit that the choir has already sung. All bow with him when he recites the Doxology. Meanwhile, the choir, after completing the Introit, begins to sing the Kyrie Eleison. *Kyrie Eleison. When the celebrant has finished reciting the Introit, he recites, again independently of the choir, the Kyrie Eleison alternately with the Master of Ceremonies (the other sacred ministers may join in with the M.C.) After this is finished the sacred ministers either form a straight line, remaining on their respective steps, until the Kyrie is nearly finished or they bow to the cross and descend the steps to sit at the sedilia if the musical setting for the Kyrie is particularly long. *Gloria in Excelsis. Toward the end of the Kyrie, the sacred ministers walk (still staying in a line) to the center of the altar. If they have been sitting, all rise, save the celebrant, who waits until his biretta has been collected by the deacon. The three sacred ministers genuflect at the foot of the altar steps, then ascend and form a line. (The deacon and subdeacon usually lift the ends of the celebrant's alb whenever they ascend the steps together, and place their closest hand under his elbows when they descend together.) The celebrant intones, i.e. sings the first few words of, the Gloria, after which the choir sings the rest and the deacon and subdeacon ascend the steps to stand at either side of the celebrant, while he says in a low voice the remainder of the Gloria independently of the choir. When they are finished they remain in this position until the singing is nearly done or, if it is a long musical setting, they may go down and sit (first genuflecting), as mentioned above at the Kyrie. (Note: The Gloria is omitted from Masses of the season during Advent, Septuagesima, Lent, and Passiontide, as well as from ferias outside Christmastide, Epiphanytide, and Paschaltide.) *Collect (sometimes called the Oration). Towards the end of the singing of the Gloria in excelsis (or Kyrie if the Gloria be omitted) the sacred ministers head to the center of the altar in a line. When the singing has finished, the Celebrant turns away from the altar and says, with hands extended to shoulder width only (Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, V, 1), \\"Dominus vobiscum\\" (\\"The Lord be with you\\"), to which is replied, \\"Et cum spiritu tuo\\" (\\"And with thy spirit\\"). The Celebrant then, with hands extended to no more than shoulder width and palms facing each other, reads the collect or prayer of the day. (Any time the verb read is used, this should be interpreted as sing in monotone, often with note variations at certain punctuations, and a special tone for the ending. The entirety of the Mass, as heard by the congregation, is sung—except the blessing, which is sung only by a bishop—though the priest recites quietly for himself everything that the choir sings, apart from short responses such as \\"Et cum spiritu tuo\\"). *Epistle. Towards the end of the collect (or the last collect if there be more than one) the Master of Ceremonies heads to the credence table to get the Epistolary or book of readings. He hands it to the Subdeacon, who bows to the crucifix at the end of the collect, if the Holy Name of Jesus is mentioned, reverences the altar and then the liturgical choir (as opposed to the musical choir) if there be one. He then stands on the floor aligned somewhat behind the Celebrant and chants the Epistle or other reading proper to the day. Meanwhile, the Priest too recites the Epistle in a low voice, and the Deacon, also in a low voice, responds \\"Deo gratias\\" (\\"Thanks be to God\\") at the end. The Subdeacon next reverences the choir, and then the altar. Ascending the steps to where the Celebrant is, he kneels while the Priest blesses him, then kisses the hand of the Celebrant, who has placed it on the Epistolary. He then hands the Epistolary to the Master of Ceremonies, who puts it back on the credence table or in some other appropriate place. *Gradual, Alleluia (or Tract), & Sequence. Once the Subdeacon has finished reading the Epistle, the musical choir begins to sing the Gradual & Alleluia (or Tract, instead of the Alleluia, in Lent), and occasionally a Sequence in certain Masses, which the Celebrant should have finished reciting for himself, after his private reading of the Epistle, before the Subdeacon has finished reading the Epistle. *Gospel. While the choir sings the Gradual and Alleluia (or Tract) the subdeacon carries the missal to the Gospel side of the altar where the priest will read the Gospel in a low voice. Meanwhile, the Master of Ceremonies takes the Gospel book off the credence table and gives it to the deacon who then places it on the altar. After the celebrant finishes reading the Gospel, the sacred ministers go to the center of the altar and the Celebrant places incense in the thurible in the usual manner. The two acolytes with candles, the Master of Ceremonies, the thurifer with the thurible, the subdeacon, and the deacon with the Gospel book assemble at the bottom of the altar steps, genuflect, and go in procession to the Gospel side of the sanctuary. The subdeacon holds the Gospel book while the deacon sings the Gospel. *Sermon (optional) *Credo. The Celebrant intones the Nicene Creed with the words \\"Credo in unum Deum.\\" While the choir sings the Creed, the sacred ministers recite the Creed in the low voice at the altar. All genuflect at the Incarnatus (\\"Et incarnatus est\\" to \\"et homo factus est.\\"). The deacon then goes to the credence table, picks up the burse containing the corporal, and then spreads the corporal on the altar. (Note: The Credo is only said on Sundays and on feasts of greater solemnity.) *Offertory. While the choir sings the offertory the ministers prepare the altar. The subdeacon goes to the credence table and receives the humeral veil. Having set the chalice veil aside, the subdeacon then carries the chalice, paten, purifacator, and pall to the altar. The celebrant receives the paten with the host. He places the host on the corporal while saying \\"Suspice sancte pater...\\". While the celebrant says the \\"Deus qui humanae...\\" the deacon pours the wine into the chalice, and after the celebrant blesses the water, the subdeacon pours a small amount of water into the chalice. With the paten in his right hand the subdeacon goes at stands facing the altar on the lowest step with the humeral veil covering his arms and the paten. Incense is then placed into the thurible and blessed by the celebrant. The oblations are incensed first, and then the altar is incensed while the celebrant says the beginning of Psalm 140 \\"Dirigatur Domine...\\". The deacon incenses the celebrant and any priests in the choir after which the thurifer incenses the rest of the altar party, followed by those in choir, and then the congregation. *Secret. After the celebrant finishes praying \\"Suscipe sancta Trinitas...\\" he says the secret prayers of the Mass in the low voice. He concludes the secret aloud \\"Per omnia secula seculorum. Amen.\\" *Preface. The celebrating priest sings either the common preface or a proper preface following the Sursum Corda. *Sanctus. Following the preface, the ministers recite the full text of the Sanctus in a low voice, and the choir begins to sing it. While the celebrating priest then quietly says the Canon of the Mass, the choir continues its singing of the Sanctus, pausing before the part that begins with \\"Benedictus qui venit\\", which it sings after the consecration (pre-1962). Post-1962, the Benedictus immediately follows. *Canon of the Mass The Canon of the Mass is said by the celebrant entirely in the low voice. The deacon stands to the side of the celebrant and kneels on the first step for the consecration. Both the host and the chalice are elevated by the celebrant immediately after they are consecrated. The deacon is responsible for covering and uncovering the chalice with the pall. *Pater noster. The celebrant sings the Pater noster aloud. At this time the subdeacon places the paten back on the altar and removes the humeral veil. *Agnus Dei. The ministers say the Agnus Dei at the altar in the low voice while the choir sings the Agnus Dei aloud. *The Pax. The kiss of peace is passed from the celebrant to the deacon, who in turn then gives the kiss of peace to the subdeacon. The subdeacon extends the kiss of peace to clergy attending Mass in the choir. While the choir continues to sing the Agnus Dei, the priest says the prayers prescribed for the preparation for his communion. *Distribution of Holy Communion. If Holy Communion is to be distributed to the congregation, the Confiteor is said, followed by \\"Ecce Agnus Dei...\\". The priest then distributes Holy Communion to the faithful, placing the Host on the tongue of each person who receives. The choir sings the Communion Antiphon at any point after Ecce Agnus Dei... *Ablutions. The celebrant cleans the chalice and his fingers with water and wine. The subdeacon then takes then covers the chalice and paten with the chalice veil and carries them to the credence table. After the ablutions, the celebrant goes to the Epistle side of the altar and reads the communion antiphon in the low voice. *Postcommunion. After singing \\"Dominus vobiscum\\", the celebrant sings the post-communion prayer or prayers. *Dismissal. Facing the congregation, the deacon sings the dismissal, which is either \\"Ite Missa est\\" or \\"Benedicamus Domino\\". *Blessing. The celebrant places his joined hands on the altar and says in a low voice the prayer Placeat tibi, sancta Trinitas for himself and those for whom he has offered Mass. Then he kisses the altar and, turning towards the congregation, blesses them \\"in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti\\", making over them the sign of the cross. *Last Gospel. The celebrant usually goes to the Gospel side of the altar and reads the Last Gospel. Since the promulgation of the 1962 Missal, which lists under six headings the occasions when the Last Gospel is omitted, the only passage used, with the exception of Palm Sunday, is John 1:1–14, in the recitation of which all genuflect at \\"Et Verbum caro factum est\\". At low Masses said on Palm Sunday (when palms are not distributed, as they should not be, unless perhaps this is the only Mass on that day) the Last Gospel is the one that is appointed for the ceremony of the blessing of the palms. When earlier editions of the Roman Missal were in use, a Last Gospel was read at every Mass, usually John 1:1–14. When there were two coinciding liturgical days (feasts, ferias or vigils) that each had a proper Gospel (one not found in the common Masses used for the various categories of saints' feast days, such as \\"common of confessors\\"), the Gospel appointed for the liturgical day being commemorated was read as the Last Gospel, just as the collect, secret, and postcommunion prayers are commemorated for that day. The exit procession then forms in the following order: crucifer between the two acolytes, the master of ceremonies, and the sacred ministers.

He is perhaps best known for his role as President of Reprise Records from 1989 to 2001. He appears occasionally as himself in music-related film documentaries and has received accolades for his stance against censorship and for his advocacy of free speech protection. Biography Howie Klein was born in Brooklyn on February 20, 1948. He is a writer and a fan of punk rock. He attended Stony Brook University in New York during the mid to late 1960s, where he first worked in the music industry by writing about bands and booking them for local performances. Notable acts he successfully promoted during those years included Big Brother, Byrds, Jackson Browne, Tim Buckley, Sandy Bull, Country Joe, The Doors, The Fugs, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, John Hammond, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Otis Redding, The Who, and the Yardbirds. He then spent several years exploring Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Amsterdam, before moving to San Francisco. There, from 1976 to 1978, he co-hosted North America's first regular punk radio show, The Outcastes, with fellow program founders entrepreneur Norman Davis and Chris Knab, then-owner of Aquarius Records on Castro Street. They broadcast from San Francisco's Jive 95, KSAN, from 2-4am on Friday nights, hosting guest interviews with bands such as the Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, Devo, The Cramps, The Dead Boys, The Nuns, and Roky Erickson. After Davis' departure from the trio in June 1978, later shows were retitiled The Heretics, and featured Davis' replacement, Sean Donahue. While Klein lived in San Francisco, he also hosted a long-running Sunday night radio program on KUSF. In 1978, he and Knab, with Bruce Bridges, co-founded the San Francisco new wave record label, 415 Records. Klein discovered and signed The Units, Romeo Void, Translator and Wire Train among others. Howie Klein joined Sire Records in 1987 and was President of Reprise/Warner Bros. Records between 1989 and 2001. During his tenure at Reprise, he attracted artists to the upscale label such as Lou Reed, with whom he had worked while at Sire. There, he oversaw the career development of recording artists such as Depeche Mode, Talking Heads, Joni Mitchell, The Ramones, The Pretenders, Neil Young, Alanis Morissette, Barenaked Ladies, Eric Clapton, Green Day, Enya, Fleetwood Mac, The Smiths, Ice-T, and dozens of other major acts. Following the Time Warner merger with AOL, on June 29, 2001 Klein resigned; accepting a buyout. David Kahne, who had worked for Klein as 415 Records' A&R; manager until 1982, now temporarily controlled Reprise as executive vice president of A&R; for its parent company, Warner Bros. The same day Klein resigned, Kahne rejected Wilco's newly recorded album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, leading to the termination of Wilco's multi-album contract with Reprise. The Washington Post noted that the change marked a \\"seismic shift\\" from the label's former \\"artist-friendly\\" reputation. During and after his work with Sire and Reprise, Klein distinguished himself as a stalwart opponent of censorship and a dedicated advocate of free speech. Reprise Records was started by Frank Sinatra in 1960, securing what he saw as artistic freedom from his former record label, Capitol Records. Klein carried Sinatra's tradition further, clearly articulating his even broader vision that creative freedom was not limited only to choosing one's business and music partners, but also encompassed the freedom to write, even about controversial topics, as one saw fit. The 1992 United States presidential election saw Bill Clinton choose Senator Al Gore as his vice presidential running mate. This decision disturbed many democrats and music industry professionals, including Klein, because Gore's wife, Tipper Gore, with Susan Baker, had co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center. The PMRC had initiated senate hearings in 1985 on \\"potentially harmful lyrics\\", spearheading a five-year effort that by 1990 had successfully forced the recording industry to implement a voluntary identification and labeling system to warn parents about music containing explicit lyrics. Tipper Gore's vocal and instrumental role in the PMRC was perceived by some as a campaign of outright censorship against musicians and the music industry itself. Klein took an active role in publicizing these concerns through speaking engagements and by becoming one of the most influential supporters of a very effective, multimillion-dollar, industry-wide campaign to register and educate young music-loving voters, called Rock the Vote. His anti-censorship efforts earned him one of two Spirit of Liberty Awards bestowed in 1999 by People for the American Way; co-honored that year was filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner.

Pind Dadan Khan lies 6 km south of Khewra Salt Mine (or Mayo Salt Mine), 24 km east of the Lillah-Toba interchange of M2 motorway and 8 km east north of Pither Nadi. Its borders with Khushab, Chakwal, Sargodha and Mandibahudin. History During British rule, it became the headquarters of the subdivision and tehsil of the same name in the Jhelum District of the British Punjab. It was on the Sind-Sagar branch of the North-Western Railway. The municipality was created in 1867Pind Dādān Khān - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 20, p. 146 and most of the income collected by the British authorities was by octroi. The population according to the 1901 census was 13,770. It was formerly the dépot to which salt was brought from the Mayo Mine, from which it was carried across the river to the railway; but the bridging of the Jhelum at Haranpur and the extension of the railway to Khewra have by-passed. In earlier days, brass vessels were made in the town and there was a considerable weaving industry. Embroidered luugis were often sold at high prices. Boat-building was a source of skilled employment, and river boats of Pind Dadan Khan make were in request throughout the whole course of the Jhelum. However, after the construction of Mangla Dam to strengthen the irrigation system of the country as part of the Indus Basin Project, there is now diminished water flow in the river Jhelum except during the flooded season. Manufactured products included glazed pottery of a deep red color, ornamented with black patterns and remarkably strong and of good quality was a speciality of the town, as well as stout leathern riding-whips made after English patterns. Nandana a village near Pind Dadan Khan is the place where Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad Al-Biruni came and he established a laboratory there which is still present there. Alberuni calculated the diameter of earth in that laboratory during his lifetime, now the laboratory seriously needs some interest by the govt of Pakistan as it is not look aftered and the building is vanishing day by day. if soon necessary care will not be given there will be no sign of great work by Alberuni However, skilled artisans have left the area. Education During the colonial era the town had a high school. Within the city limits of Pind Dadan Khan, there are one government degree college for boys and one government degree college for girls already established and running. There is also one College of Technology in the government sector and has stated admission for three years Diploma course. Classes are started in this college.Many other private colleges are also there.A number of private schools are there to provide quality education to the residents of the area. Almost 80% peoples are educated and increasing day by day. Health care A Tehsil Headquarter Hospital is maintained by the Ministry of Health. There are many private hospitals with almost all the required facilities. Dominant source of income A view of a field in Pind Dadan Khan, Pakistan Agriculture and salt are the usual source of income. In addition to this, two cement factories are a major source of income for the locals. Languages The language spoken in Pind Dadan Khan tehsil is Lahnda based Punjabi with blend of many diaclects such as Saraiki, Wanhari, Pothohari and Lunhari. Railway Station There is a railway station, which facilitates inexpensive travel. The train passes through a bridge known as Victoria Bridge through which the train passes through 3 districts in 1 to 2 minutes.

It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property developed by Kee Games, which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies. In the game, two players drive tanks through a maze viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines, represented by X marks, in a central minefield. Each player controls their tank with a pair of joysticks, moving them forwards and back to drive, reverse, and steer, and firing shells with a button to attempt to destroy the other tank. The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point, and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the player with more points when time runs out, with each game typically one or two minutes long. Tank was designed by Steve Bristow, who had previously worked with the founders of Atari on Computer Space, the first arcade video game, and was developed by Lyle Rains. It was created as part of Bristow's vision to move the company away from only producing copies of Atari's games into also developing original titles. The game's cabinet was designed by Peter Takaichi. In September 1974, Atari announced a merger with Kee, which went into effect a month after the release of the game. The game was commercially successful, selling over 10,000 units and buoying Atari's then-troubled finances. It led to a cocktail cabinet release of the game and to four sequels: Tank II (1974), Tank III (1975), Tank 8 (1976), and Ultra Tank (1978). A dedicated console version of Tank II was announced in 1977 but cancelled later that year; the joysticks for the game, however, became the standard joystick controllers for the Atari 2600 (1977). Variations on the game were included in the Atari 2600 game Combat, as well as in the Coleco Telstar game Telstar Combat!, both in 1977. Gameplay Tank is a two-player maze game in which the players, each controlling a tank, attempt to shoot each other. The maze is a set of blocks set at right angles to each other with an empty square central area all viewed from above; the shape of the maze is not symmetric, and is the same between games. One of the tank sprites is white and the other is black, while the central area is filled with black X marks representing land mines. The tanks can fire shells, which destroy the other tank if they hit; tanks are also destroyed if they hit a land mine. The destruction of a tank grants the opposing player a point and causes a brief explosion and accompanying sound, during which time the other tank cannot shoot, before restoring the tank at the same position. Destroyed land mines do not return. Points are displayed above the play area, and flash during the final twenty seconds of the round. The game continues until the time runs out, after which the player with the higher point value wins the match. Each game typically costs a quarter and lasts for 60 seconds, but an internal toggle adjusts it to two quarters and 120 seconds. The time can be further adjusted by operators. The game is displayed on a black-and-white television screen, and the tanks are controlled by two joysticks each. Pushing both joysticks moves the player's tank forward, and pulling them both back causes the tank to stop. Pulling them in different directions or amounts causes the tank to turn in place or while moving, respectively. A button on the top of the right joystick fires a shell. Development Photo of gameplay; the two tanks are at the bottom and neither player has scored. The arcade game market is split into manufacturers, distributors, and operators; manufacturers like Atari sell game machines to distributors—who handle several types of electronic machines—who in turn sell them to the operators of locations. In the early 1970s, distributors bought games on an exclusive basis, meaning that only one distributor in each distribution region would carry products from a given arcade game manufacturer, restricting the manufacturer to only the operators that distributor sold to. Atari, in 1973 just over a year old and largely based on their hit first game Pong, felt that as a smaller manufacturer this setup severely limited their ability to sell arcade games: they could only contract with a limited number of distributors, who would only buy a limited number of games per year. To work around this, Atari set up a secret subsidiary company in September 1973, Kee Games, which was intended to sell clones of Atari's games, in effect doubling their potential reach. Kee did have its own manufacturing equipment and therefore the ability to develop original titles, however, and after several clone games lead engineer Steve Bristow developed the idea for a new title. Bristow, who had previously worked with the Atari founders on Computer Space, the first arcade video game, came up with the idea while thinking of how he could improve Computer Space. His idea to correct the perceived shortcomings of the game were to replace its difficult to control rocket ships with more straightforward tanks, and to make it a two-player game instead of a single-player one. As the company's only engineer, Bristow rapidly developed a prototype himself before turning the game over to new hire Lyle Rains to develop into a finished product, codenamed K2 Tank. Rains added the maze and central minefield to the game design and developed the final hardware, including the simple control scheme. Peter Takaichi designed a large custom cabinet to house it. Tank was one of the first games to use integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)—to store graphical data, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used; it is sometimes claimed in sources to be the very first, but was preceded at minimum by Atari's Gran Trak 10 (1974). Integrated circuit-based memory thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. Before the game could be completed, Kee Games was merged into Atari in September 1974; Tank was released that November 4th. Legacy Tank was a commercial success and is credited with buoying the finances of the newly merged Atari at a critical time for the company. It sold over 10,000 units, considered a large hit at the time, though Ralph H. Baer claims that was only the 1974 sales, with a further 5,000 sold in 1975. Atari produced a second version of the game, a cocktail cabinet form in which the two players sat across a circular table from each other. A sequel, Tank II, was released in 1974 to sales of around 1,000 units; gameplay was identical, though the maze could be changed to a new format by modifying the circuitry and more sound effects were added. It was followed by three further sequels: Tank III in 1975, the first game to be third in a series; the color Tank 8 in 1976, which featured eight tanks and players simultaneously; and Ultra Tank in 1978, which reverted to a two-player black and white game with the ability to select multiple different maze types and have invisible tanks. A dedicated console version of Tank II was announced by Atari at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1977, but was cancelled by the end of the year; the joysticks for the game, designed by Kevin McKinsey, became the standard joystick controllers for the Atari 2600 (1977). The Atari 2600 game Combat, released in 1977, includes several variations of Tank, including ones with bouncing shots or invisible tanks. Combat was initially developed as a console version of the arcade game, like the cancelled dedicated console version, with additional plane-based game modes added during development. Despite Atari's cancellation of the dedicated console version of Tank, a dedicated console game inspired by Tank was still released in 1977 by Coleco: the Telstar game Telstar Combat! plays four variations of Tank, and was released prior to the Atari 2600 and Combat.

It was based on the earlier M13/40 and M14/41 medium tanks, and was built with the lessons from the North African Campaign in mind.Comando supremo: Italy at war: Carro M.15/42 History of M15/42 The tank was meant to be a stopgap until the heavier P26/40 tank could be produced in numbers. It did not serve in North Africa, the theatre in which it was intended to operate, but served in Italy and in Yugoslavia with the German Wehrmacht.M15/42 In German ServiceFlames of War Web site: Italian Armoured Vehicles in German Service, Italy 1944-45  Development  After witnessing the inadequacies of their M13/40 and M14/41 medium tanks, the Italian Army decided that they needed a stopgap design until the heavier P26/40 was ready for production. The M13/40 and M14/41, although comparable to most of their early British and Allied contemporaries, had several severe drawbacks which made them very unsuited for the deserts of North Africa. Moreover, their guns, although adequate against most medium tanks, could not penetrate the most heavily armoured British types being fielded in North Africa at the time. In early 1941 the Italians attempted to create a tank, the M16/43 \\"Saharan Fast Medium Tank\\", based on the design of a captured British A15 Crusader tank. Although the prototype tank performed well in trials, the type was cancelled in 1943; by this time, Italy had lost its North African territories and no longer needed a fast tank built for the deserts of North Africa. During the development of this tank, the Germans offered both their Panzer III and Panzer IV medium tanks for licensed production, under the condition that they supply half the resources needed for production, and all of the guns and sights for the tank. The Italians, not wanting to hand their industries to the Germans, rejected the offer, deciding instead to settle on an improved version of their own M14/41. This tank would be 12 centimetres longer than the original M14/41, and would mount a new gun originally meant for the M16/43, a new gasoline engine (the 12 litre 190 hp SPA 15TB M42, chosen due to a shortage of diesel fuel in Italy at the time) and a new drive. The vehicle, officially known as the Carro Armato M15/42 (\\"M\\" for medium tank, the weight in tonnes (15), and the year of adoption (1942)), incorporated improvements learned from the battles in North Africa; but development of the tank's main gun and ammunition meant that it could not enter production until 1 January 1943, when it was already obsolete. The main armament consisted of an improved version of the 47 mm/L32 main gun, known as the 47 mm/L40. It was mounted in a fully rotating, electrically driven turret, and had an elevation of 20 degrees, and a depression of 10 degrees. The gun was capable of firing hollow charge, high explosive, and armour piercing rounds. The secondary armament consisted of five Breda 38 machine guns (two mounted in the hull, another two in a coaxial mount, and the fifth on top of the tank in an anti-aircraft mount.) = Production = Nicola Pignato in his work quotes 180 tanks registered with their respective license plates before the armistice. A study, written by the expert Davide Guglielmi and published in the bimonthly magazine Storia Militare, talks about 124 tanks captured by the German armed forces and 28 more produced during 1944. The total, therefore, would amount to 152 units. Cappellano on publication number 6 of 2013 of the same journal recorded different production statistics. His study was based on an original Ansaldo document. In addition to the prototype dating back to 1941, there are reported 103 vehicles assembled in 1942 and 36 in the first quarter of 1943, plus 80 planned up to December 31, 1943; however it is not known if this last quote was reached. Furthermore, the study does not mention the M15/42 produced after the Italian capitulation.  Combat use  Italy began producing the M15/42 on 1 January 1943, and by mid-1943 had produced about 90. After the armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943, Italian formations from the 135th Armoured Division Ariete II fought with German troops moving to disarm them in Rome. The M15/42s were among the tanks they used in this battle. After the armistice, Germany confiscated all remaining M15/42s. Under the Germans, an additional 28 incomplete M15/42s were produced. In German service, the M15/42 fought mostly in Yugoslavia, with 85 tanks being stationed there by December 1944.  Variants  = M.42 command tank = The M15/42 served as the basis for the design of the \\"M42 Self-Propelled Command tank\\", intended to serve in departments equipped with self-propelled guns. The turret was removed and the rolling ring closed with an 8 mm thick armored plate, in which two doors were obtained; on the roof was mounted a Breda Mod. 38 of 8 mm in anti-aircraft function. The two Breda Mod. 38 in the casemate were instead replaced by a single Breda Mod. 31 of 13.2 mm and two Magneti Marelli radios, an RF1 CA and an RF2 CA and two extra batteries were placed in the hull; finally a rangefinder was installed. The M42 was produced in 45 units in 1943. A small number was captured by Germany, which placed them in service under the designation Panzerbefehlswagen M42 772 (i): they were employed in the Italian war theater until the end of hostilities. = Self-propelled guns = The M15/42 served as a basis for the development of various self-propelled guns: the Semovente 75/34, Semovente 75/46 and the Semovente 105/25 A prototype self-propelled anti-aircraft gun carrying four 20 mm Soctti-Isotta Fraschini anti-aircraft guns in a lightly armoured turret, based on the M15/42, was produced in 1943. After the armistice the Germans captured this vehicle, and may have used it as a model for their self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, derived from the Panzer IV medium tank (Flakpanzer IV).

History On the outskirts of the town lie the ruins of the palace within a fort. The palace was the residence of the Rani Chennamma. In the 18th century, Kittur was ruled by the Marathas, until the Third Anglo-Maratha War, when it came under British suzerainty. Kittur was ruled by Mallasaraja in the early 19th century. His only son predeceased him, and subsequently, he was succeeded by his wife, Queen Chennamma. In connection with a disputed succession to this chiefship in 1824, St John Thackeray, Commissioner of Dharwad, was killed in a battle when approaching the Kittur fort. Later another unit stormed Kittur and captured Queen Chennamma, who was imprisoned in Bailhongal Jail where she died. Rani Chennamma became a legend. Her death was followed by subsequent revolts by her general Sangolli Rayanna, who was also considered a hero, destroying many British officers and records. He was later hanged in 1831. The town lends its name to the fictitious coastal town in the 2008 novel Between the Assassinations by Aravind Adiga (Belgaum District has no coast, which rules out the real Kittur being the setting).

Lakhva is considered to have been the location of one of the first, if not the first,Michaeli, Lichstein, Morawczik, and Sklar (eds.). First Ghetto to Revolt: Lachwa. (Tel Aviv: Entsyklopedyah shel Galuyot, 1957).Suhl, Yuri. They Fought Back. (New York: Paperback Library Inc., 1967), pp. 181-3. Jewish ghetto uprisings of the Second World War. Geography Lakhva is located in the Luninets district of Brest Region, approximately 80 kilometres to the east of Pinsk and 200 kilometres south of Minsk. It lies on the Smierc River, to the north of the Pripet Marshes. The town is located within Polesia, a marshy region that has historically been at the confluence of various empires and states. As such, Lakhva has, at various points in its history, been under Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Soviet, German, and Belarusian control. History =16th century to 20th century= The earliest mentions of Lakhva are contained in records from the late 16th century pertaining to the Estate of Łachwa, a large private estate in what was then the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The estate was held jointly by the Radziwiłłs and the Kiszkas, two powerful and significant Szlachta (noble) families of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.Siekierski, M. The Estate of Łachwa of Prince Nicholas Christopher Radziwiłł (1549-1616): A Contribution to the Study of the Historical Geography and Economy of Southern Byelorussia, The Journal of Byelorussian Studies. (London: The Anglo-Byelorussian Society, 1981), Vol. V, No. 1, pp. 19-28. The tax receipts and registers from the era, pertaining to the estate holdings of Prince Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł, indicate that grain farming played an unusually small role in the economy of the estate, as compared to other parts of the Grand Duchy. Given the marshy and wooded terrain, the local economy was instead dominated by fishing, hunting and forestry. On March 23, 1588, the Estate of Łachwa was formally divided between Prince Radziwiłł and Jan Kiszka, with the village falling within the Radziwiłł holdings. It is known that Lakhva became a town at some point during this period. The 1588 agreement between Radziwiłł and Kiszka dividing the estate refers to Lakhva as a village, but a document dated February 23, 1593 refers to it as a town and to its residents as townspeople. After 1593, archival documents consistently refer to Lakhva as a town. A tax receipt from 1596 indicates that the portions of the town subject to tax consisted of 7 houses in the town square, 60 street houses, 20 \\"poor dwellings\\" (chałupy nędzne), 2 craftsmen, 4 tenants without cattle, 4 vendors and one mill-wheel. Due to conflicting royal charters, Lakhva fell within the administrative control of both the powiat of Nowogródek and the powiat of Pinsk. Prince Radziwiłł apparently preferred to deal with the administration in Nowogródek, leading to protracted legal proceedings by the authorities in Pinsk. In 1600, King Sigismund III settled the dispute by confirming that Lakhva belonged to Nowogródek. The town remained within Poland until the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, when it was absorbed into the Russian Empire. Russian dominion over the area lasted until the end of the First World War, when the region was briefly ceded to the German Empire under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. After the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-21, Lakhva once again fell under Polish control, and was incorporated into the Polesie Voivodship of the Second Polish Republic. Located only 18 kilometres from the boundary of the Soviet Union,Shworin, Aron. The forgotten resistance in Lachva. B'nai B'rith Canada. August 6, 2004.

(last accessed September 30, 2006) reflecting an eastward migration of Jews during that period.Kriwaczek, Paul. Yiddish Civilization: The Rise and Fall of a Forgotten Nation. (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2005). By the 20th century, Lakhva was a well-established shtetl with a rapidly growing Jewish population. At the end of the First World War, Jews constituted a third of the town's population, but by the late 1930s, the Jewish population had doubled to 2300 (out of an overall population of 3800).Lachva, Multimedia Learning Centre: The Simon Wiesenthal Center. (last accessed September 30, 2006) On September 17, 1939, Soviet troops entered Lakhva, following the partition of Poland between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union pursuant to the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact. the town was incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. As a result of the Soviet occupation, virtually all Jewish organizations ceased to function. Even though Soviet authorities closed or placed heavy restrictions on Jewish cultural and religious institutions, the Jewish population of Lakhva increased by 40% between 1939 and 1941, as Jewish refugees fled German- occupied areas to those lands incorporated into the Soviet Union. =Jewish ghetto= Jewish uprising memorial Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, and German troops occupied Lakhva on July 8, 1941, two weeks after the start of Operation Barbarossa. On April 1, 1942, the town's Jews were forcibly moved into a ghetto consisting of two streets and 45 houses, surrounded by a barbed- wire fence. The ghetto housed roughly 2,350 people, with approximately 1 square meter for every resident. The Ghetto was to be liquidated on September 3, 1942 and a Jewish underground resistance formed, led by Icchak Rochczyn.Steinberg, p. 183. When the Germans entered the ghetto, an uprising occurred, and members of the ghetto underground attacked the Germans. This battle is believed to represent one of the first, and possibly the first, Jewish ghetto uprisings of the Second World War. Approximately 650 Jews, including Rochczyn, were killed in the fighting and by the flames, and another 500 or so Jews were taken to the execution pits and shot. Six German soldiers and eight German and Ukrainian policemen were also killed. The ghetto fence was breached, and approximately 1000 Jews were able to escape. Approximately 90 residents of the ghetto survived the war. Jewish cemetery in Lakhva =After the Second World War= The survivors of the Lakhva ghetto did not return to the town, settling in Israel and other countries instead. At present, there are few, if any, Jewish inhabitants in Lakhva, although a small memorial to the 1942 Jewish uprising was erected in 1994.Lakhva Holocaust Memorial. Belarusian News Agency In 2000, Kopel Kolpanitsky, a survivor of the Lakhva ghetto, was one of six Holocaust survivors invited to speak at Yad Vashem during the state ceremonies for Holocaust and Heroism Memorial Day. Kolpanistky, who had been 16 years old at the time of the ghetto uprising and who managed to escape into the forest, recalled during the ceremony how his entire family was killed during the uprising.Katzenell, Jack.

He is the author of A Beast in View (London: André Deutsch), The Future of Treason (New York: Ballantine), A Gardener Touched with Genius: The Life of Luther Burbank (New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan; rev. ed., Berkeley: University of California Press; new, expanded ed., Santa Rosa, CA: Luther Burbank Home & Gardens), Martyrs and Fanatics: South Africa and Human Destiny (New York: Simon & Schuster; London: Secker & Warburg), and most recently the novel Isacq (Charlottesville, VA: Hardware River Press, 2017). Dreyer was born and brought up in South Africa, where he was involved in the anti-apartheid struggle, serving on the Cape Provincial Committee of the Liberal Party, founded and led by Alan Paton, and as secretary of the Western Province Press Association, which published the fortnightly The Citizen (not to be confused with the pro-apartheid tabloid of the same name launched in 1976), which introduced the concept of nonracial democracy in South Africa. At the time, the Liberal Party was the only unsegregated political party in South Africa. The African National Congress (ANC) restricted its membership to black Africans (excluding not only \\"whites\\" but \\"Coloured\\" and Indian South Africans too), and did not desegregate itself until many years later. Dreyer put forward the idea of nonracialism in a pamphlet titled Against Racial Status and Social Segregation (Claremont, Cape Town, 1958; now very rare, but to be found in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, the Hoover Library at Stanford University and the South African National Library in Cape Town). The Citizen Group also worked to establish nonracial trade unions, resistance to bus apartheid in Cape Town, and a nonracial theater project, which led to a production of Jean Genet's The Blacks. On February 8, 1958, Patrick Duncan launched the Liberal Party fortnightly Contact, with offices on Parliament Street in Cape Town. Dreyer worked closely with Duncan, and in Contact, 1, no. 15, dated August 23, 1958, he published an article about the newly formed nonracial South African Meat Workers Union under the by-line “Contact Special Correspondent.” On the cover of the magazine, Duncan placed the Citizen group slogan “Forward to a South African patriotism based on non-racial democracy”—the first prominent demand for a nonracial answer to apartheid.  Angela van Bengale  Dreyer’s earliest forebear in South Africa was a slave, Ansla [Angela] van Bengale [of Bengal], also known as Mãe [Mother] or Mooij [Beautiful/Pretty] Ansla, imported there in 1657 and bought by Commander Jan van Riebeeck. Manumitted, she married a German free burgher named Arnoldus Basson. Their great-granddaughter Catharina Maasdorp (1757–86) later married the frontiersman Daniel Ferdinand Immelman (1756–1800), the guide of the Swedish naturalists Carl Peter Thunberg and Anders Sparrman (Linnaeus's star pupils) in the Cape Interior in the late eighteenth century. Peter Dreyer is a direct descendant of Catharina and Daniel Ferdinand.  Subsequent career  Peter Dreyer left South Africa in 1962 and subsequently launched and edited Omphalos: A Mediterranean Review in Athens. In 1972, however, he was expelled from Greece by the military junta then in power there and moved to the United States. In New York he was a contributor to The Nation and to Coburn Britton's belletrist magazine Prose. During the 1970s, he was book columnist for San Francisco magazine and a frequent contributor to the San Francisco Review of Books. He has lived in Virginia since 1988. Dreyer's 2017 novel Isacq (Hardware River Press) is a picaresque account of the (fictional) life and adventures of his forefather Isacq d’Algué, alias Johannes Augustinus Dreyer (1689–1759; grandnephew of the Pietist leader August Hermann Francke), with brief flash-forwards into the future. Thousands of people living in southern Africa today are descended from Isacq d’Algué, who arrived at the Cape in 1713 as an adelbors, or midshipman, on a Dutch East India Company ship. Dreyer is currently at work on a memoir dealing with his early experiences in the anti- apartheid movement and looking at how things have turned out.  A Beast in View  Dreyer's novel A Beast in View (1969), which was banned by the apartheid government of South Africa immediately on publication, was undoubtedly the first work of fiction ever to deal with the controversial subject of fracking. Set in part in an apartheid Greater South Africa, in a hypothetical future, the novel features a scheme to extract oil from shale in the Karoo region by detonating nuclear bombs in the shale bed. This was not just science fiction: the idea was based on an actual proposal by the Continental Oil Company to the United States Atomic Energy Commission, \\"Project Dragon Trail: The Stimulation of a Natural Gas Reservoir by a Contained Nuclear Explosion,\\" which envisioned setting off a 40-kiloton device in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, with the assistance of the CER Geonuclear Corporation (three 33-kiloton nuclear devices were eventually detonated as a test in 1973 under the rubric Project Rio Blanco). Continental Oil was not alone in the nuclear fracking field: the Standard Oil Company (Indiana) obtained a 1967 patent for the same purpose (U.S. Patent 3,342,257, \\"In Situ Retorting of Oil Shale Using Nuclear Energy\\"). In Dreyer's novel, this apocalyptic plan is foiled by guerrillas sent in by an internationally based \\"League of South African Democrats\\" (there is no mention in the book of the ANC). Proposals to extract oil and gas by fracking in the Karoo are currently under consideration.  Isacq: A Review  There has been an upsurge in interest over the past ten years in the genealogy of the Dreyer family in South Africa. A work of fiction was published recently in the USA that is bound to be of great interest to the many genealogists interested in the history of this and the many other related South African families. Isacq: A Novel (Hardware River Press, 2017; ) is written by author Peter Richard Dreyer, a tenth-generation descendant of Johannes Augustinus Dreyer. . . . Isacq tells the story of the life and times of Johannes Augustinus Dreyer, progenitor of the Dreyer family of South Africa, as well as a number of other prominent South African families. Johannes Augustinus Dreyer arrived in South Africa on 8 Nov 1713, on board the Dutch East India Company ship the Nesserak on a voyage from Texel in the Netherlands to Batavia under the nom de plume Isacq d’Algué. He was 25 years old. Born in the small town of Grube, close to Lübeck, in [what is now] the northern German province of Schleswig-Holstein to the local Lutheran pastor and his wife, and studying at the University of Rostock by 1708, it remains one of the enduring questions of the Dreyer family history how and why he came to land up in the Cape under a different name, five years on. In the novel the author uses these basic facts to weave a rich and colourful story of adventure, human folly, comedy and tragedy around this intriguing figure. And yes, it is a story—an interesting mix of historical fact and Informed conjecture. What makes it of interest to family historians is that this novel is based on the most painstaking research that has probably been done on the history of the Dreyer family. As a direct Dreyer descendant, with a long-time interest in the family history, I found the story mesmerising. A very impressive amount of research and astute interpretation has also gone into recreating the early 18th century historical and philosophical milieu within which Isacq’s story unfolds. It is a great pity that having written this as a novel (understandable in the light of the patchy nature of the historical facts), the book misses references and a bibliography. The many amazing facts that were uncovered during the author’s research (such as the fact that Isacq was the grandnephew of the Pietist leader August Hermann Francke) have all been worked into the fabric of the novel, but there is no way the reader can distinguish between these and pure conjecture. One can only hope that the author will at some stage write up the annotated results of his research. The novel is not bed-time reading. One could treat it as such and just gulp it down out of fascination for the “story”, but that would be a pity. Much food for thought would be lost. Isacq’s ruminations on his life and times (and Isacq’s “thoughts” are at times too clearly the thoughts of an author with the hindsight of today), are provocative and insightful. In fact, the play between the voices of Isacq and author, in many places merging into one, form a most interesting feature of the novel. . . . In all, a fascinating and very worthwhile read—highly recommended to anyone interested in early South African history, genealogy, social history, and the European history and intellectual milieu of those times.—Jeanne Maartens, Cape Family Research Group and Families INFO SA, February 2018  Notes  Martyrs and Fanatics was reviewed in the New Republic by Nobelist Nadine Gordimer. Dreyer's exchange with Stephen Jay Gould in the New York Times Book Review on the subject of Luther Burbank can be found at nytimes.com. Gould reviewed the first edition of A Gardener Touched with Genius, in the New York Times and trashed it on grounds of Burbank's Lamarckism. When Dreyer responded with a letter to the editor, Gould counterpunched aggressively. Moreover, as Dreyer and others have pointed out, Charles Darwin himself was a Lamarckian.

Recording artist While studying classical composition at the Birmingham Conservatoire, Moray released the home-recorded I Am Jim Moray EP. During 2002 he appeared at the Glastonbury festival and the Cambridge Folk Festival gaining notice in the music press. A nomination for the \\"Horizon Award\\" at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2003 followed before he began work on his first full-length album, Sweet England. The album was recorded in his bedroom while completing his final year of study. Sweet England was released in June 2003 on his own Niblick Is A Giraffe record label. At the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2004 he was presented with the Album of the Year Award for Sweet England and the Horizon Award for best newcomer. He was also nominated twice in the Best Traditional Song category for Early One Morning and Lord Bateman. Moray recorded and released the single Sprig of Thyme in May 2004, and in the autumn appeared on the Oysterband's Big Session Volume 1 album. This gained yet more Folk Award nominations in 2005, including one for Cuckoo's Nest, which was sung, produced and mixed by Moray. After a long gestation period, Moray's eponymous second album was released on 1 May 2006. Moving away from the electronic sound of Sweet England it features a more orchestral sound and denser song structures. On 6 July 2007, The Independent featured Sweet England in its \\"Cult Classic\\" series, affirming its impact and influence on the modern folk scene. Jim Moray's third album, Low Culture, was released on 14 July 2008. On this album Jim makes use of African kora, the melodeon and mandolin and mbira thumb-piano. Low Culture won the fRoots Critics Poll Album of the Year 2008 and was also the MOJO Folk Album of the Year 2008. It was also nominated for the Album of the Year Award in the BBC Folk Awards 2009. On 1 February 2010 it was announced that Jim Moray's fourth album In Modern History would be given away as a covermount CD with the June edition of Songlines magazine, with a street date of 30 April 2010. It was also announced that the album would be available in a deluxe box set and standard editions on 7 June 2010. Moray's fifth studio album Skulk was released on Bandcamp with no build-up or warning in January 2012 going straight to number 1 on the Bandcamp chart. It received a full release on 9 April 2012. Moray received three nominations in the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards for Best Album, Folk Singer of the Year and Best Traditional Track (for Lord Douglas). Along with singer and guitarist Sam Carter, in 2014 Moray launched a new band named False Lights to play traditional music with electric instruments. Their album Salvor, produced by Moray, was released in February 2015 and they announced headline shows at Folk East, Trowbridge Village Pump and Homegrown festivals. Producer Aside from all of his own albums he has gradually begun to produce other artists, mainly from his own studio in Bristol profiled in a Sound on Sound feature in 2006. Moray produced and mixed the track \\"The Cuckoo's Nest\\" for the Oysterband Big Session in 2004. This was a live album, recorded over two nights, featuring a similar line-up to the tour he took part in in 2003. The track was nominated in the BBC Folk Awards that year. During 2005 Moray produced and performed on James Raynard's debut album Strange Histories, released in September 2005 on One Little Indian records. In 2008 he wrote and produced the song The Wishfulness Waltz for his sister Jackie Oates' second album The Violet Hour, as well as playing all the instruments on the track. He subsequently produced and mixed her third album Hyperboreans which was released in September 2009 and nominated for three BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards (including best album), and MOJO magazine's top folk albums of 2009. In 2015 he produced and mixed her sixth album \\"The Spyglass And The Herringbone\\" as well as co-writing the majority of the tracks.

In 2014 he produced and mixed the second album by singer and songwriter Maz O'Connor, \\"This Willowed Light\\". They worked together again on her forthcoming third album \\"The Longing Kind\\". In the same period he also produced the debut album by London folk band Tir Eolas, \\"Stories Sung, Truths Told\\". Moray produced Salvor, the debut album by False Lights – his collaboration with Sam Carter, in 2015. Live performer Moray's live shows have frequently featured video projections and lighting effects, something relatively uncommon in British folk music. During 2001–2003 Moray played as a solo performer, becoming well known for using a laptop and loop pedals live. After the release of Sweet England in 2003, he began playing with a variety of accompanying musicians, notably drummer Laurence Hunt. This flexible line-up toured extensively as an electric band, with Moray playing electric guitar and supplemented by samples and sequences from laptops onstage. Following the Jim Moray album, during 2007–2008 Moray's line-up solidified around a core of melodeon player Nick Cooke and violinist James Delarre, frequently performing as an acoustic trio before eventually adding drummer William Bowerman in 2008. Bowerman left the band in summer 2009 to join electro-pop act La Roux and was replaced by Dave Burbidge. After puncturing both lungs, Cooke was replaced by Saul Rose for some festival appearances in summer 2009. In 2012 Moray toured with an expanded \\"Skulk Ensemble\\" to play the Skulk album live, with added brass, bass and his sister Jackie Oates on backing vocals. As an opening act or collaborator, Moray has toured with Oysterband, Eliza Carthy, Billy Bragg, Richard Thompson, Ani Di Franco, Bellowhead, Will Young, The Cecil Sharp Project and John McCusker. He also performed as Orpheus in Anaïs Mitchell's folk opera, Hadestown in January 2011 at the Union Chapel in London.

Tatiana Riabouchinska darns a ballet slipper, circa 1940. Tatiana Mikhailovna Riabouchinska (, 23 May 191724 August 2000) was a Russian American prima ballerina and teacher. Famous at age 14 as one of the three \\"Baby Ballerinas\\" of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the 1930s, she matured into an artist whom critics called \\"the most unusual dancer of her generation.\\"Vicente García-Márques, \\"Riabouchinska, Tatiana,\\" in International Dictionary of Ballet, edited by Martha Bremser (Detroit: St. James Press, 1990), vol. 2, pp. 1197–99. Includes a chronology of roles performed and an appraisal of her artistry. Early years She was born in Moscow a few months before the October Revolution in 1917. Because her father was a banker to the Tsar Nicholas II, the whole family was put under house arrest by revolutionaries. But, with the help of their servants, her mother and the four children escaped and fled through the Caucasus, arriving eventually in the south of France. A few years after they had settled in Paris, where there was a large Russian émigré community, Tatiana, known as Tania, began her ballet studies with Alexandre Volinine, who had trained at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow. She also studied with Mathilde Kschessinska, a friend of the family who had been prima ballerina assoluta of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theaters.Mary Clarke, \\"Tatiana Riabouchinska,\\" The Guardian (London), obituary (28 August 2000). Under Volinine's tutelage, the girl developed strength, elevation, and speed; under Kschessinska, quick footwork and lyrical port de bras. At 14, Riabouchinska was chosen by Nikita Balieff to join his Franco-Russian vaudeville troupe, Le Théâtre de la Chauve- Souris (The Bat Theater), often billed simply as La Chauve-Souris. In the 1931 edition of their revue, which featured Russian songs, dances, and comedy numbers, she appeared in two short ballets, Diana Hunts the Stag and The Romantic Adventures of an Italian Ballerina and a Marquis. In Paris, she was seen by choreographer and ballet master George Balanchine, who quickly signed her for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, then being organized by Colonel Wassily de Basil and his associates. She joined that company after the American tour of La Chauve-Souris. She and two other young dancers in the company became known as the Baby Ballerinas.Amanda. \\"Ballets Russes\\", The Age (17 July 2005) Career In 1932, in her first season with the de Basil company, Riabouchinska created the role of the Child in Léonide Massine's Jeux d'Enfants and in two works by Balanchine, La Concurrence and Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme. Subsequently, she created roles in other Massine works, including the first three of his famous, and controversial, \\"symphonic\\" ballets: Frivolity in Les Présages (1933), set to Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony; the third and fourth movements of Choreartium (1933), set to Brahms's Fourth Symphony; and Reverie in Symphonie Fantastique (1936), by Berlioz. After Michel Fokine joined the company, he created the roles of the Golden Cockerel in Le Coq d'Or (1937), the title role of Cendrillon (1938), and the Florentine Beauty in Paganini (1939) especially for her. Besides these roles, she danced in many other ballets in the company repertory. For Les Sylphides, perhaps Fokine's most famous work, she was coached by the choreographer himself. Her dancing of the Prelude, with exquisite pointework, soft little jumps, feathery landings, and liquid arm movements, became legendary, and she retained the role throughout her career. Riabouchinska also created many roles in ballets choreographed by David Lichine, a principal dancer in the de Basil company, who made a second career as a choreographer. Besides leading roles in Nocturne (1933) and Les Imaginaires (1934), she embodied the Chief Spirit in Le Pavillon (1936), the Angelic Apparition in Francesca da Rimini (1937), the Flower Girl in Le Lion Amoureux (1937), and the Romantic Girl in Graduation Ball (1940), a joyous characterization that became another of her signature roles.Kathrine Sorley Walker, De Basil's Ballets Russes (London: Hutchinson, 1982). Riabouchinska remained with the de Basil company, which was finally renamed as the Original Ballet Russe, until 1942. The conflict of World War II disrupted its normal operations, and the company had to stop touring in Europe. She married David Lichine in 1943, and the two of them embarked on a joint career as free agents, dancing and choreographing for many companies in the United States, England, France, and Argentina. They had one daughter, Tanica Lichine. In the United States, Riabouchinska also appeared on Broadway in an unsuccessful operetta entitled Polonaise (1945), choreographed by Lichine to music of Frédéric Chopin. She appeared in a Hollywood film, Make Mine Music (1946), in which she and Lichine danced his choreography in the \\"Two Silhouettes\\" sequence.Larry Billman, Film Choreographers and Dance Directors (Jefferson, N.C.: MacFarland, 1997), p. 394. Throughout their years of dancing together, they were one of the ballet world's most admired and beloved couples. Later years In 1953, the Lichines retired to Los Angeles, where they devoted their energies to their dance academy in Beverly Hills. They also founded and directed several small performing groups. After David Lichine died in 1972, Riabouchinska continued to teach for many years, counting a number of Hollywood celebrities among her students. In the late 1990s, she was filmed teaching class in her studio and reminiscing about her years with the de Basil company. This footage, along with many archival film clips of her performances with the company, is included in the documentary film Ballets Russes (2005), a Goldfine/Geller production.

Most democracies (in one way or the other) provide cash grants (state aid) from taxpayers' money, the general revenue fund, for party activity. Such funds may cover routine or campaign costs incurred by the party. Among the established democracies the United States (the Presidential Fund takes money from the general fund of the US government only after authorized by a statement indicated upon a taxpayers tax return), Switzerland and India are the most notable exceptions. Party subsidies can be relatively small (as in the U.K.) or quite generous (as in Sweden, Israel and Japan). The recipients of public support (in cash or kind) are party organizations, parliamentary groups (party caucuses) and/ or candidates for public office (parliament or presidency). In combination with rules that enforce fair access to and fair distribution of state aid among the players of the political game, government funding for political activity can be an acceptable policy option for democratic polities. The allocation of party subsidies follows general rules for access to and distribution of such grant, for example access for all parties represented in the national parliament and distribution in proportion to the number of seats held in the current parliament, or in proportion to the number of votes polled in the most recent election. Many subsidy schemes are linked to reporting and disclosure obligations for the recipient parties. Rare instruments of party subsidies are matching funds and tax credits. Matching funds are granted to a political competitor who has proven to a government authority that he or she solicited small individual donations. Tax credits can be deducted by the taxpayer from tax liability because some part of a political donation is treated like an advance payment on tax. Because matching funds and tax credits depend on financial contributions by individual citizens such support is more compatible with a participatory concept of democracy than flat grants, which do not require specific efforts by the fundraising parties (or candidates). In many democracies public funding for political parties was introduced after scandals, which revealed political corruption or illegal funding, had become public knowledge. In other countries, the rising costs of political competition stimulated the spread of party subsidies (government funding). Although the mainstream opinion is in favour of party subsidies now, they are still disputed.Cf. Pinto-Duschinsky: 'it's their party, and we pay for it', in: The Sunday Times, October 22, 2006 - http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/article608907.ece. Supporters of party subsidies argue that directly providing the campaign funds reduces political corruption, as parties do not need to raise \\"money with an opinion/ strings attached\\". History In 1954 Costa Rica and Uruguay were the first countries to introduce party subsidies. They were followed by Puerto Rico (a U.S. territory in the Caribbean) in 1957 and West Germany in 1959. In Quebec (1963), a Canadian province, Sweden (1965), Finland (1967) and Israel (1969) parties received such support rather early.Alexander, Herbert E. (ed.): Comparative Political Finance in the 1980s, Cambridge, UK et al.: Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 14/15. Since the 1970s, party subsidies were introduced by Norway (1970), Canada and Italy (1974), Austria (1975), the U.S. (1976), Australia (1984), Denmark (1986), France (1988), Belgium (1989), Japan (1994), Ireland (1997), the Netherlands (1999), the U.K. (2000) and New Zealand (2010). Nowadays among the established democracies only India and Switzerland stand out as exceptions to the rule.Casas-Zamora, Kevin: Paying for Democracy. Political Finance and State Funding of Parties, Colchester, UK: ECPR, 2005, pp.30/31. By now it is also used in Greece, Portugal, Spain and other more recently established democracies in Europe and Latin America. In Italy, following the abolition of the state financing of political parties, clear examples are initiatives of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who organized on 6 and 7 November 2014, two fund-raising dinners, held respectively in Rome and Milan, for the Italian Democratic Party, which included, among the dinner guests. In Italy however political parties keep receiving money even if the state financing was abolished (James Pallotta). Criticism Critics of party subsidies argue that party subsidies:For a brief compilation of pros and cons see Casas-Zamora; Paying for democracy. Polirtical finance and state funding for parties. Colchester, UK: ECPR Press, pp. 28/29. * make parties less accountable to their supporters, because they have less of a need to solicit donations, * petrify the party system and thereby lock the democratic process, because subsidies are distributed based on prior election results and not on current voter attitudes,The argument to the contrary was already published in: Alexander, Herbert E. (ed.): Political Finance in the 1980s, Cambridge UK et al: Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 248/249. * make the formation or electoral participation of new parties more difficult, because such parties do not receive public funding right from the start and occasionally private funding is prohibited.The Greens (Die Grünen) and the Pirate Party (PIRATEN) in Germany are examples to the contrary after they had survived their very first, unsuccessful election bids.

Although the horse is still able to breathe, it is unable to swallow, and may become severely dehydrated. A secondary condition, aspiration pneumonia, may also develop if food material and saliva accumulate in the pharynx, spilling into the trachea and into the lungs. Choke is one of the \\"top 10\\" emergencies received by equine veterinarians.Mississippi State University, CARES programme The condition is seen in other Equidae like mules and donkeys. Causes Chewing: Horses may develop choke if they do not chew their food properly. Therefore, horses with dental problems (e.g. acquired or congenital malocclusion, loose or missing teeth, or excessively sharp dental ridges) that do not allow them to completely grind their food are particularly at risk. In addition, horses that bolt their feed and do not take the time to chew properly are more likely to suffer from choke. Dry Food: Dry foods may cause choke, especially if the horse does not have free access to water, or if the horse has other risk factors linked to choking. While pelleted or cubed feeds in general fall in this category, horse owners sometimes express particular concerns about beet pulp. However, while horses have choked on beet pulp, a university study did not document that beet pulp is a particular problem. It is believed that choke related to beet pulp is linked to the particle size and the horse's aggressive feeding behaviour, rather than the actual feed itself. Research suggests that horses that bolt their feed without sufficient chewing, or who do not have adequate access to water, are far more likely to choke, regardless of the type of feed, compared to horses that eat at a more leisurely rate.Warren, Lori K. \\"Horse Feeding Myths and Misconceptions \\" Horse Industry Section, Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Web site accessed June 28, 2010 The risk of choke associated with any dry feed can be reduced by soaking the ration prior to feeding. Foreign Objects: Horse may ingest non-edible materials such as pieces of wood. Cribbers may be more prone to this type of choke, if they happen to swallow a piece of wood or other material while cribbing. Signs of choke Discharge of the nostrils in a donkey with choke due to eating dry sugar beet pulps 3 days ago; note enlarged esophagus in the shaved area * Difficulty swallowing (horse may try to swallow without success) * Lack of interest in food * Coughing * Extending the neck and head, usually in a downward direction * Discharge from the nostrils. usually green in color, although it may also be yellow or clear, often looks like vomit * Increased salivation, saliva drooling from the mouth * Heart rate may increase slightly, due to the distress of the animal * Occasionally, a lump on the side of the neck is visible or can be palpated, where the esophagus is blocked. This is normally most obvious on the left. Diagnosing choke If a horse is suspected of choke, a veterinarian will often pass a stomach tube down the animal's esophagus to determine if there is a blockage. Failure to access the stomach with the tube indicates a complete obstruction; difficulty passing the tube may represent a stenosis, or narrowing; or a partial obstruction. Radiography and endoscopy are also used in refractory cases. Treatment surgery of choke in a donkey: in opened esophagus, note reflux of sugar beet pulps Choking horses should be deprived of food and drink pending veterinary attention, so as not to increase the obstructive load within the esophagus. The veterinarian will often sedate the horse and administer spasmolytics, such as butylscopolamine, to help the esophagus to relax. Once the muscles of the esophagus no longer force the food down the throat (active peristalsis), it may slip down on its own accord. If spasmolytics do not solve the problem, the veterinarian will usually pass a stomach tube through one of the nostrils and direct it into the esophagus until the material is reached, at which point gentle pressure is applied to manually push the material down. Gentle warm water lavage (water sent through the stomach tube, to soften the food material) may be required to help the obstructing matter pass more easily, but caution should be exercised to prevent further aspiration of fluid into the trachea. Refractory cases are sometimes anesthetised, with an orotracheal tube placed to prevent further aspiration and to allow for more vigorous lavage. Disruption of the impacted material can sometimes be achieved via endoscopy. If these methods still do not lead to results, the horse may require surgery to remove the material. Some workers have advocated the use of oxytocin in choke, on the grounds that it decreases the esophageal muscular tone. However, this technique is not suitable in pregnant mares, as it may lead to abortion. Following up After the material has passed, a veterinarian may try to prevent the onset of aspiration pneumonia by placing the horse on broad- spectrum antibiotics. The animal should be monitored for several days to ensure that it does not develop pneumonia, caused by inhalation of bacteria- rich food material into the lungs. The material caught in a horse's throat usually causes inflammation, which may later lead to scarring. Scarring reduces the diameter of the esophagus (a stenosis or stricture), which increases the chance that the horse may choke again. The veterinarian may therefore place the horse on a course of NSAIDs, to help to control the inflammation of the esophagus. Often the horse will only be fed softened food for a few days, allowing the esophagus to heal, before it is allowed to gradually resume its normal diet (e.g. hay and unsoaked grain). Horses with re-occurring chokes may require their diet to be changed. Prevention * Always provide water for the horse * Soak dry foods before feeding to horses prone to choke * Change feeds gradually * Discourage the bolting of food: spread out feed, place large, flat stones (large enough so that the horse can not swallow it) or salt blocks in the feed bin so that the horse must slow down, or feed smaller meals more often * Cut apples, carrots, or other treats into small pieces * Withhold feed material for one hour following sedation References * * Category:Horse diseases ","title":"Choke (horse)"},{"id":"3387286","text":"O'Reilly on Advertising (2005) was a popular show that was broadcast Saturday mornings on CBC Radio One, running from 11:30 - 12:00pm (half an hour later in Newfoundland).

Its producer and co-creator was fellow adman and broadcaster Mike Tennant. \\"The program explored the world of advertising in a fun and irreverent way,\\" and is essentially a primer on media literacy, illustrating how advertisers create successful (or unsuccessful, as the case may be) radio ads. It ran for a total of 25 episodes, not including repeats, and concluded airing on December 31, 2005. Some of the topics covered in the series include branding, the effective use of tag-lines, the Lion Advertising Awards at Cannes, and Public Service messages. It also examined why some advertising campaigns win or fail, how good copywriting can make a difference, and also trends in ad creativity. The show was produced independently for the CBC by Pirate Radio and Television in Toronto. A CD set is for sale on the CBC Store website.

General Michel Joachim Marie Raymond (25 September 1755 – 25 March 1798), popularly known as Monsieur Raymond, was a French General in Nizam's military and the founder of Gunfoundry Hyderabad, Hyderabad. He was born in Sérignac, Gascony, France, the son of a merchant. Early life In 1775, aged 20, he and his younger brother, William Jean Raymond, left for Pondicherry, India. The idea as he told his father, was to set up a merchant shop. Instead, Michel turned to the more exciting career of being a soldier. Life A remote view of tomb In 1775, Raymond reached Pondicherry to start a merchant shop, later he met and served under French General Bussy, but it was in 1786 that Michel joined the service of the ruling Nizam of Hyderabad. He began as any other soldier, shortly after, he was given 300 soldiers to command. In 1796, Raymond was appointed Amar-e-Jinsi or Comptroller of Ordnance. He established several cannon and cannonball factories. Under his guidance guns, ammunition and cannons were forged. Gunfoundry or Top ka Sancha near the Fathe Maidan is the best-known of the remaining foundries in India. When he died in 25 March 1798, only twelve years after enlisting, he had become a military commander of over 14,000 army men. It is also documented that there may have been a female battalion of soldiers. The cause of Michel Raymond's death is a mystery, the two suggested causes are poisoning or suicide. Respect Raymond became a close friend of the Nizam Ali Khan, Asaf Jah II. Raymond was not only held in high esteem by the Nizam, but had also won the love and trust of the local people. He made himself popular through his kindness, bravery and contribution to Hyderabad. To the Muslims, he was Musa Rahim, and to the Hindus, he was Musa Ram. George Bruce Malleson said that :\\"No European of mark who followed him in India, ever succeeded in gaining to such an extent the love, the esteem, the admiration of the natives of the country.\\" Raymond's Tomb Michel Raymond's tomb Michel Raymond's tomb is a black granite tombstone, conical in shape, about 7 metres high and it has the initials JR on it. The ill-maintained pavilion was built by the Nizam and collapsed in October 2001 in heavy rain. The 200-year-old tomb had a face lift, including a brand new pavilion. Opened 14 April 2003 this cost an estimated 500,000 INR. The tomb is located near Asmangadh fort on top of a hillock at Mussa Ram Bagh, Malakpet, about 3 km from the Oliphant Bridge (currently known as Chaderghat Bridge), in East Hyderabad. Until about 1940, people would visit his tomb on the anniversary of his death, taking incense and other offerings to him. His grave had become like a shrine. He is also remembered in Hyderabad, with the area called Mussa Ram Bagh (Monsieur Raymond).

It is sometimes referred to as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal, as credited on the sleeve. The EP was Bowie's final release of new material for RCA Records; he signed with EMI Records for his next album. Background In August 1981, Bowie had begun rehearsals to appear in the BBC version of Baal. The lyrics to the songs were all translated by Ralph Manheim and John Willett. Bowie did not think of the television play as a success on broadcast due to its cinematography, but had grown to appreciate it by 1983.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p06w6m3y Dominic Muldowney provided all new musical settings, except for \\"The Drowned Girl\\", which was a setting by Kurt Weill done originally for Das Berliner Requiem. In September 1981, Bowie and Tony Visconti returned to the Hansa studios in Berlin to re-record the five songs Baal performed in the play. \\"Baal's Hymn\\" is a combination of the vignettes spread throughout the play and establishes Baal's amoral character. \\"Remembering Marie A.\\" concerns Baal's reminiscences of a past conquest, where he can remember a cloud drifting overhead but not the face of the girl he was with. \\"Ballad of the Adventurers\\" is Baal's aggressive lament to the death of his mother. \\"The Drowned Girl\\" relates the suicide of one of Baal's conquests – a video clip for this song was shot by David Mallet at the same time as the one for \\"Wild is the Wind\\". \\"The Dirty Song\\" is a short number, with Baal humiliating his lover Sophie. Reception Bowie's performance as Baal was transmitted on 2 March 1982, and RCA issued the EP to coincide with this. Both the play and EP were well received, with the latter reaching No. 29 in the UK chart, commendable considering the unconventional tracks. In addition to the 7\\" edition, which came packaged in a double gatefold sleeve containing extensive notes pertaining to the musical content and a short biography of Bertolt Brecht, the EP was released as a 12\\", which gained it some play in clubs as well as radio airplay. It would mark Bowie's final new release for RCA Records. Bowie's next release was issued by EMI. Subsequent releases \\"The Drowned Girl\\" was featured on the 2005 triple CD set The Platinum Collection and then the 2007 re-release of its third CD under the title The Best of David Bowie 1980/1987. \\"The Drowned Girl\\" and \\"Baal's Hymn\\" are both included on the 2003 and 2014 expanded re-issues of Sound + Vision. The EP was re-released as a digital download in 2007. All five tracks were also included as part of the Re:Call 3 compilation disc, exclusive to the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set, released in September 2017.

The film was written and directed by Brian Cox with Javier Hernandez serving as Associate-Producer. It stars Wilmer Valderrama, Angie Cepeda, Joel David Moore, Billy Drago, Tony Plana, Michael Parks, María Conchita Alonso and Tony Amendola. The film follows the story of Diego de la Muerte, a 21-year-old Mexican-American who is abducted, sacrificed, and sent back to the land of the living by the Aztec gods of death and destiny to fulfill an ancient prophecy. The official premiere was held on March 1, 2007 at the Latino Film Festival in San Diego, California with a straight-to-DVD release slated for September 18, 2007 followed by subsequent screenings in New York City and San Diego. The official site address (www.elmuertomovie.com) has since been re-directed to a MySpace film account. The film is rated PG-13 for violence and some disturbing images. El Muerto has gone on to win the Best Feature Film Award at the first annual Whittier Film Festival in 2008.Official Whittier Film Festival listings of 2008 JAVZILLA: El Muerto screens in WhittierJAVZILLA: Wins best feature film Plot Centuries ago, the Aztec Empire of Mexico was conquered by the Spanish conquistadors. Horrified by their religious practices, the Spaniards set out to convert the native population to Catholicism, effectively declaring war upon the Aztec religion. According to an ancient prophecy, the Aztecs and their religion will return to dominance in a time known as the Sixth Sun. While attempting to illegally cross the United States-Mexico border, young orphan boy Juan Diego is singled out by a fellow traveler, a strange old man known only as \\"Old Indian\\" claiming to know the way. The old man leads the boy to an old Aztec shrine dedicated to the god of death, Mictlantecuhtli. Explaining that they must give thanks to Tezcatlipoca, the god of sacrifice, Old Indian proceeds to carve a symbol of the god in to Diego's hand. Declaring the boy's blood to be pure, the Old Indian dies in the throes of invocations of Nahuatl, abandoning the boy in the desert. Ten years later, 21-year-old Diego has made a home for himself in East Los Angeles. He shares an apartment with his best friend Zak and is in love with Maria, niece of Padre Somera of the local mission which dates back to the Cortés era. However, Diego and Maria's relationship is strained both by his haunting encounter with Old Indian and the devout Padre's disapproval of the young man's sympathy towards Aztec beliefs and mythology. Anticipating a local Dia de los Muertos festival, Diego begins to feel the call of something powerful. He dresses as an undead Mariachi, clad in black with the traditional markings to give himself a skeletal appearance. En route to the celebration, the forces of the Aztec underworld cause Diego's car to crash, ending his life. Diego awakens in the Aztec afterlife of Mictlan where the god of death sacrifices him to Tezcatlipoca in a ritual where his heart is torn from his chest with the aid of an obsidian blade. He is then sent back to the land of the living exactly one year after his death. Diego, selected long ago by the Old Indian, is the sacrificial priest in service to Tezcatlipoca. In order to fulfill the prophecy of the Sixth Sun, Tezcatlipoca requires three human sacrifices, each symbolizing the Catholic Church that wiped out the old gods over five hundred years ago. And Maria, being the direct descendant of the Somera family is at risk. Armed with the power to take life or restore it, Diego must struggle against the very gods who created him in order to save the woman he loves. Cast and characters *Darien Dikeos as Young Juan Diego: While trying to cross the border into the states, a young Juan Diego is singled out by an old Indian man who speaks the Aztec language. The Indian man leads him to a small shrine, performs an ancient ritual, and declares the boy's blood is pure. Soon after, the man goes into convulsions and dies in the violent throes of strange mutterings and invocations. *Billy Drago as The Old Indian/Catrina (Indio Viejo): A strange old Native American man who marks Diego with an Aztec symbol representing Tezcatlipoca and soon after dies. *Wilmer Valderrama as Juan Diego (Diego de la Muerte / El Muerto): Ten years later, a 21-year-old Diego has made a home for himself in the Latino community of East Los Angeles. Diego has fallen in love with Maria, a young lady who is the niece of the padre of the local mission, and whose family goes back to the very first Christian missionaries to settle the southwest. However, Diego's past still haunts him and secretly dreads the thought of his destiny. *Joel David Moore as Zak (Zak Silver): Longtime friend to Diego, who is crushed to hear of his friend's demise, but shocked to find his friend still lives as the walking-dead. Zak is the more skeptical character in the movie, often preferring logic to faith. *Angie Cepeda as Maria Somera (Maria Hermosa): Love interest to Diego and best friend. She is descended from the first Christian missionaries from Spain to settle in the southwest, dating back to the Cortés era. *Tony Amendola as Padre Somera: Father of the local mission and the uncle of Maria. The Padre, a very dogmatic Catholic, would often get into theological debates with Diego who was fascinated by Aztec culture and mythology. Padre Somera's disapproval of Diego placed strain on the couple's relationship. *Tony Plana as The Caretaker (Aparicio): An older Chicano man and caretaker of the local cemetery. He befriends Diego after witnessing his powers and acts as his mentor. The character of Aparicio was the invention of director Brian Cox, which was inspired by a minor character in the original comic book. Hernandez has gone on record saying that Aparicio was his favorite character in the film. *María Conchita Alonso as The Nun (Sister Rosa): A nun of the local mission with an abused past. *Michael Parks as The Sheriff (Sheriff Ezra Stone): A police sheriff investigating recent murders within the Somera mission and strange occurrences surrounding Maria. *The Aztec gods Mictlantecuhtli and Tezcatlipoca were both created through special effects. Mictlantecuhtli was made up of puppetry and other visual effects, being depicted as a giant skeletal figure and speaking entirely in Nahuatl. Tezcatlipoca's depiction was completely computer-generated with his voice supplied by Alfonso Arau (credited as \\"Voices\\"). The film also referenced Tezcatlipoca's many epithets, such as Night Drinker. Javier Hernandez made a cameo appearance in the film in which he has a short conversation with El Muerto, credited as \\"Man in Costume\\", while co-producer Susan R. Rodgers appears in an uncredited cameo as a participant in the Dia de los Muertos festival. Rafael Navarro, longtime friend of Hernandez and fellow comic book creator had a brief cameo as a witness of a car wreck inadvertently caused by El Muerto. Film production =Development= One year during the San Diego Comic-Con, Hernandez was interviewed by NPR regarding his comic. A few weeks after, the segment finally aired and caught the attention of director Brian Cox. The director contacted Hernandez and scheduled a meeting in which they talked of the character in depth. At the end of the conversation, Cox asked if he would ever consider El Muerto as a film. A question to which Hernandez responded, \\"Well, I wouldn't NOT consider it!\\" Shortly after their meeting, Brian contacted Larry Rattner, a close friend and producer. Coincidentally, Rattner had just met a family that had just come out of a successful publishing venture and were interested in financing a film. Rattner soon convinced them of the potential of an El Muerto film. A script for the film was written by Brian Cox with Hernandez serving as Associate-Producer. Hernandez was excited to have Valderrama play the lead, stating in an interview, \\"Wilmer is just drop-dead perfect! Really, it was a lucky break for us getting him to play Diego de la Muerte/El Muerto. He is so completely immersed in the role. For him, it's a chance to play a leading role in a film. And he sees the franchise potential with this character. I mean, he's playing a comic book superhero, how cool is that!?\\"SequentialArt.com: \\"El Muerto Goes From Comic To Movie\\" In the same interview he also praised the supporting cast, saying \\"The quality of actors should give you an idea about the quality of the script.\\" The film rights to El Muerto were later purchased by Peninsula Films in May 2003. Valderrama described the film as \\"The Crow meets Desperado meets Spawn. It's an odd choice for me, but I love making those.\\" He later added, \\"It's presented in such an odd, hardcore, rad way...very Robert Rodriguez. It's very, very hard. It's a beautiful story told through the eyes of this young guy who's sacrificed in the name of the Aztec gods and he comes back to be a weapon for them. And [instead] he rebels against them and asks all these questions about religion.\\"DarkHorizons.com: Valderrama talks \\"El Muerto\\" =Filming= Filming officially ended on February 14, 2005.El Muerto...on my mind by Javier Hernandez (Los Comex, July 2005) \\"On Valentine's Day this year (2005) we began our last day of shooting on the El Muerto film...it was about 3:00 pm that afternoon when we got started...15 hours later, the following morning, we filmed our final shot...After the scene we heard the fateful words, \\"Cut. Okay, that's a wrap!\\"El Muerto Forum - Movie News On September 20, 2006, Hernandez announced that the final cut would be privately screened, stating that the film was \\"officially done\\": =Design and special effects= Tezcatlipoca was entirely computer-generated and voiced by Alfonso Arau. Valderrama wore different types of make-up including full theatrical make-up, full prosthetic make-up, and was required to wear black contact lenses. Mark Bautista, key make-up for the film, explained the varying types of make-up used and their different levels: \\"Within the makeup itself, Diego proceeds to go to a party. The party make up is more or less like a theatrical make up - subtle, something you do at home. Once [his] accident occurs this makeup is now cauterized into his face, I wanted to make that makeup almost look scarified.\\" Much of the costume and dress design followed a strict color palette reflecting the Dia de los Muertos. For Angie Cepeda's character, her colors in rust, gold, marigold, orange colors representative of the marigold from the Dia de los Muertos tradition. Valderrama's costume design was a direct-adaptation from the comic book series with very few changes. Special effects were used to create both the Aztec gods. While Mictlantecuhtli required visual effects and puppetry by Nathan Mussel, Tezcatlipoca was entirely computer generated and throughout the film he is shown to manifest himself on dark mirrored surfaces. Tezcatlipoca was more prominent to the film's overall plot, and therefore made more appearances in the film than Mictlantecuhtli. =Soundtrack= The music and film score were composed by Tony Humecke with Bill Ewart serving as music supervisor. The soundtrack kept to the film's Aztec roots by featuring pre-Hispanic music as performed by Martin Espino.Martin Espino's official siteMySpace.com -Mexika Martin Espino's official MySpace Espino also played a vital role due to his ability to speak the Aztec language of Nahuatl, which can be heard in various chants throughout the film.JAVZILLA: Oxnard screening a hit!

In the comic book series, Diego is in fact a natural- born citizen. *In the comic book, the more prominent antagonist is Mictlantecuhtli. The film instead depicts a more vengeful Tezcatlipoca as the villain. *Maria's last name in the comic book is Hermosa, while in the film it was changed to Somera in order to lend a connection with the Spanish Conquest of Mexico. *In the comic book, Diego and Maria ended their relationship long before his death. In the film however, they never broke up. *Shortly after becoming El Muerto, Diego decides to leave his hometown and head to Mexico in search of answers. In the film, no such trip is made.

Freire was born in Vagos, Aveiro District on 25 April 1942. Freire's first work was an EP, released in 1968, with the title \\"Livre\\" (\\"Free\\"), that included 4 songs. \\"Livre\\", \\"Dedicatória\\", \\"Pedro Soldado\\" and \\"Eles\\". The best-known song was \\"Livre\\", a hymn to the free will and thought as the album was released during the Fascist regime of Oliveira Salazar, against the official censorship. After that, Freire became a close friend of some of the most influential left-wing musicians like Zeca Afonso, Padre Fanhais or Adriano Correia de Oliveira. Some years later, still during the dictatorial regime, Freire participated in a TV show, in the only Portuguese station operating at the time, RTP, the \\"Zip-Zip\\", singing a poem by António Gedeão called \\"Pedra Filosofal\\" (\\"Philosopher's Stone\\") that became his most well-known song. Later, he released an album composed by 11 songs, which had lyrics written by Portuguese poets, like António Gedeão, José Gomes Ferreira, Fernando Assis Pacheco, Eduardo Olímpio, Sidónio Muralha and José Saramago. For this album, Freire received the Portuguese Press Award, the most prestigious prize awarded to a musician in Portugal, at the time. After the Carnation Revolution, in 1974, Freire continued his political action through the music, acting for the working class in several places around the country. In 1978, he returned with another album, \\"Devolta\\", once more, singing poems of great Portuguese poets. He then continued his work as a computer technician, but returned in 1993 with a re-edition of his work \\"Pedra Filosofal\\". In 1995, he performed in the opening of the Festa do Avante!, a cultural event, carried out by the Portuguese Communist Party. His show, along with the Portuguese folk band Brigada Victor Jara, was an homage to Adriano Correia de Oliveira. Nowadays, he continues his career, often playing in Trade Union or Communist rallies. In 2003, Freire was elected president of the Portuguese Society of Authors. As of July 2010, he still holds that position.

His career began in 1989 after appearing on a Greek reality show. Following a brief period of stage acting, Alkaios dedicated himself to music. His first single, \\"Ti Ti\\", made him popular in Greece. His distinctive musical style fuses Greek and Oriental elements with modern pop music. To date he has been certified with 5 platinum and 9 gold albums. Alkaios represented Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song \\"OPA\\", and placed 8th in the Final. Early life Giorgos Alkaios was born in Athens to Greek and Portuguese parents. He is the son of Yannis Vassiliou, a successful Greek elafro-laiko singer. His mother, Maria (Rodrigues) Griggs – Author of \\"Mama Sou: Metamorphosis of a Mother\\" and accomplished IT Programmer Analyst – recently returned to Boston, MA after 8 years living in Pembroke, Maine where she focussed on writing her memoir of the abduction of her son by his father. Immediately after his birth, Alkaios moved to Boston, where he lived for three years. Shortly after his parents divorced, he moved back to Greece with his father at age three. Raised primarily by his grandmother Anna, he lived in Halandri and spent his summers in Salamina with friends and relatives during his childhood. He got his first job at the age of twelve. From a young age Alkaios showed his love for music and sports. His first experience with music and theatre came at a summer camp in Varimpompi, where he was also a camp counsellor for four years. At the age of sixteen Alkaios dropped out of high school to become an electrician by attending Delta school where he obtained a degree. Career =1989–1991: Beginnings= Alkaios first television appearance came in September 1989 at the age of seventeen on one of the first reality shows in Greece, \\"Ela Sto Fos\\" (Come to the light), on ET 2. The show featured 1,500 new actors, singers, and dancers, which were later narrowed down to twenty, with Alkaios being one of them. While on the show, he studied dance with Daniel Lomel, acting with Niki Triantafilidou, and music with Giorgos Hatzinasios, among others. During the summer of that same year, he auditioned for and won a part in Minoa Vouonaki's play \\"Sofoklis 'Antigone'\\", which starred legendary Aliki Vougiouklaki and with music by Mikis Theodorakis. Rehearsals lasted over two months and the show premiered at the ancient theater Epidavros. At the time, Alkaios became the youngest actor to be cast in a historic play and also perform in a historical theater. During the same summer, Alkaios decided to change his focus from theatre to music. He was then introduced by fellow singer Christos Dantis to BMG A&R; Director Vangelis Yannopoulos, while recording his debut album for BMG, \\"Aman\\". Vangelis Yannopoulos auditioned Alkaios (who, at that moment still bore his name, Vassileiou) and decided to sign him with the record company. Together, they found Alkaios' future \\"sound\\" and \\"style\\". In the summer of 1991 Alkaios went on tour all over Greece along with his fellow Christos Dantis. In September of that same year, Alkaios participated in the Thessaloniki Song Contest with the song \\"Den Me Theleis Tolmiro\\", where he officially started to go by the name \\"Giorgos Alkaios\\" as opposed to his birth name which he had used up until that point. Alkaios beat out then newcomer Sakis Rouvas, and won the award for \\"Best Vocals\\" by one point. Before the release of his debut album, Alkaios also began writing music for other singers including Alexia (for the album \\"Matia mou\\", BMG, also a Vangelis Yannopoulos' production) and Notis Sfakianakis. One of the most notable songs he wrote during that time was \\"Opa Opa\\" for Sfakianakis' same title album, the first of this singer released with Minos Emi after Notis' departure from Sony Music Entertainment Greece. A song which became a huge hit and has been covered many times over the years (notably by Helena Paparizou's band Antique) and Despina Vandi. =1992–1998: Debut and success= In 1992, Alkaios released his debut album titled Me Ligo...Trak. Music on the album was written by Alkaios, while lyrics were exclusively written by Evi Droutsa who finished the record production that Vangelis Yannopoulos had initiated. The single \\"Ti Ti\\" (a cover of Khaled's Arabic smash hit \\"Didi\\"), and which mean \\"What ? What ?\\" became a massive hit in Greece, and was one of the first Greek songs to mix oriental sounds with Western pop, following thus the paths that Christos Dantis' \\"Aman\\" had traced before, thus confirming Greek new music standards at the time. During the next nine years, Alkaios collaborated with Gavrilis Pantzis, new BMG A&R; Director after the departure of Vangelis Yannopoulos to Minos Emi, leading to many gold and platinum albums. For the next five years, he wore a black scarf on his right hand that became his trademark, while he also became one of the first few Greek male artist that openly embraced fashion. In 1993, he released his second album titled Ax! Koita Me (Oh! Look at me), followed by Den Peirazei (It doesn't matter). In 1995 he released \\"Anef Logou\\" which went Gold. This was followed by Entos Eaftou and later En Psihro which both went platinum. =1998–present: Further success= In 1998, Alkaios signed with Sony Music Greece, and create with producer Gavrilis Pantzis, the \\"DNA\\" label, distributed by Sony Music. Elli Kokkinou's first ever single and album was released by DNA label and produced by Gavrilis Pantzis, with a little help from Alkaios. Shortly after he released the album Ixoi Siopis which featured a completely new look for Alkaios, while the album art work shocked many. The album went gold in less than 24 hours and later Platinum. Sirmatoplegma followed in 1999, which also went gold in less than 24 hours and later platinum. Turkish football team Galatasaray selected the single \\"Sirmatoplegma\\" as an anthem. In 2000, he released Pro Ton Pilon followed by Oxigono on 2001 which both went gold. A CD Single titled \\"Karma\\" was released in 2002. In 2002, he wrote the hit single \\"Pame Ela\\" for Pamela. In 2003, Alkaios signed with Alpha Records, and shortly after released the album Kommatia Psihis. For the winter season of 2003–2004 Alkaios performed with Antzi Samiou at club Gefira. In 2005, Alkaios released the live album titled \\"Live Tour\\". The album, which featured three CDs, featured songs recorded throughout the previous twelve years at various concerts in Greece, the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Albania, and Cyprus. In 2006, Alkaios signed with Virus Music, collaborating again with Miltos Karatzas who took care of him while he was managing director of BMG Greece. Shortly after in November 2008, Alkaios founded his own record label with Kaiti Garbi's husband, Dionysis Schinas Friends Music Factory. In 2010, Giorgos Alkaios and Friends were announced amongst nine other entries to take part in a Greek National Final organized by national broadcaster ERT to represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. On 12 March 2010 Alkaios and Friends were selected by the Greek public along with a jury, to represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song \\"OPA\\". On 25 May 2010, Alkaios performed 13th in the first semi-final finishing 2nd with 133 points, thus granting him a spot in the Final. On 29 May 2010, Alkaios performed 11th in the final, and finished in 8th place with 140 points. Since then, Alkaios seems to be retired on the Greek island of Milos, while in December 2011 – January 2012, record sessions took part for a \\"reloaded\\" of all his hits under the working title \\"Deja vu\\". Some tracks have already emerged on YouTube. And a forthcoming tour is under discussions. Discography =Studio albums= *1992: Me Ligo Trak *1993: Ah!

He is noted for his subtle use of color and chiaroscuro, and the sober realism of his works, which are mostly religious subjects, with a few portraits, which are given interest by their accessories or settings, \\"some even look like extracts from larger narratives\\".Penny, 338 About 40 paintings are known in all, six of them portraits; only a handful of drawings are known. He was highly regarded in his own lifetime, and several repetitions of works were commissioned, and copies done by others. But he slipped from general awareness, and many of his works were assigned to more famous artists, especially Giorgione, by the art trade. Awareness of him revived in the 19th century, though the dating of many paintings remains controversial among specialists.Penny, 337-339; Hartt, 617-618 Biography Mary Magdalene, ca. 1535–40. oil on canvas, London, National Gallery Savoldo was born in Brescia, but little is known about his early years. Some sources claim he was known as Girolamo Bresciano.Cristiani 1807, p. 186 By 1506 he was in Parma, and by 1508 he had joined the Florentine painter’s guild. In this period he finished the Rest at the Flight from Egypt (Augsburg), the Elijah Harassed by a Crow (National Gallery of Art, Washington), and a Deposition. Saint Anthony abbot and saint Paul hermit. Gallerie dell'Accademia In 1515 he painted the Portrait of a Clad Warrior, traditionally identified with Gaston of Foix. Also from the same period is the Torment of St. Anthony. In this work, which is in the Timken Museum of Art, Savoldo shows St. Anthony with his hands clasped in prayer, fleeing from a hellish vision into a daylight, pastoral landscape. Like other northern Italian painters of the time, Savoldo was interested in Flemish painting, particularly the nightmarish monsters of the Flemish artist Hieronymus Bosch, which influenced his depiction of the tormentors in this work. As the saint flees, his hands point to a monastery, a reminder that he was the father of the monasticism movement. These works were appreciated by the commissioners from Venice, where Savoldo relocated before 1521.Bayer & Metropolitan Museum of Art (2005), p. 32 On June 15, 1524, he signed a contract for an altarpiece for the church of San Domenico in Pesaro (now in the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan). In 1527, he completed a St. Hieronymus for the Brescian family Averoldi, probably the one at National Gallery of London. From the 1530s dates a Nativity at the National Gallery in Washington DC, which seems influenced by the lambent painting of the same subject by his contemporary, Correggio. In 1533 Savoldo painted a Madonna with Four Saints in the church of Santa Maria in Organo (in Verona), while in 1537–38 he executed the altarpiece for the main altar of Santa Croce, Brescia (destroyed during World War II). From 1540 are the two Nativity paintings for the church of San Giobbe of Venice and the church of San Barnaba of Brescia, as well as the famous Magdalen painting. Savoldo's students in Venice included Paolo Pino. Savoldo may have spent some years of his life in Milan, and is known to have made paintings for the Milanese duke Francesco II Sforza in 1534. Savoldo had a Dutch wife. The exact date of his death is not known: in 1548 he was cited as still living in Venice, though vecchione (\\"Very old\\"). After his death, he was almost entirely forgotten for three centuries. A rediscovery of his oeuvre began in the mid- nineteenth century; art historian Creighton Gilbert says Savoldo was \\"one of the last artists to be raised to the ranks of the major High Renaissance masters\\". Overview Saint Matthew and the Angel, 1534, oil on canvas, Metropolitan Museum of Art Savoldo's paintings show eclectic influences, and combine Venetian coloration with Lombard modeling to obtain a quiet lyricism. He appears to be influenced by Titian and Lorenzo Lotto and, in his preoccupation with clearly defined shapes in light, by Cima da Conegliano and Flemish painters. Among artists of his time, he was unusual in his marked preference for compositions showing a single figure, or few figures in a quiet setting.Gilbert His corpus of works is not large, comprising about 40 paintings and ten drawings. Savoldo was noted during his lifetime for his mastery of nocturnal effects.Bayer & Metropolitan Museum of Art (2005), p. 33 His Saint Matthew and the Angel (1534; Metropolitan Museum of Art), which Andrea Bayer has called \\"one of the most evocative nocturnal scenes in Italian painting\\", prefigures Caravaggio's famous painting in the Contarelli Chapel in Rome, with a luminescent gown standing in contrast to the dark background. His Mary Magdalene (ca. 1535–40; London, National Gallery), one of several versions Savoldo painted of this subject, is a masterpiece of lighting effects. The Magdalene is shrouded in a white satin mantle that covers her head, leaving her face in shadow, with the silvery expanse of drapery relieved by the merest glimpse of a red sleeve.

The term is most often used for the landfall points of submarine telecommunications cables and submarine power cables. The landing will either be direct (in the case of a point-to-point cable system) or via a branch from a main cable using a submarine branching unit. The branch can be several kilometres long. A landing point of SEA-ME-WE 4 on Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh Selection criteria Cable landing points are usually carefully chosen to be in areas: # that have little marine traffic to minimise the risk of cables being damaged by ship anchors and trawler operations; # with gently sloping, sandy or silty sea-floors so that the cable can be buried to minimise the chance of damage; # without strong currents that would uncover buried cables and potentially move cables. Such locations are rare, and will usually be the shared landfall point for several cable systems. Associated facilities Frequently, there will be a nearby cable landing station, or cable termination station, which may well be shared between multiple cable systems, but in some cases, the cable may be laid many miles inland before reaching its termination point. A cable landing station may or may not be required, depending on whether, for example, the submarine cable requires power in order to provide power to submarine repeaters or amplifiers. The voltages applied to the cables can be high--3,000 to 4,000 volts for a typical trans-Atlantic telecommunications cable system, and 1,000 volts for a cross- channel telecommunications cable system. Submarine power cables can operate at many kilovolts: for example, the Fenno-Skan power cable operates at 400 kV DC. A cable termination station is the point at which the submarine cable connects into the land-based infrastructure or network. A cable termination station may be the same facility as the cable landing station, or may be many miles away. The termination station will usually be the point where high-capacity 'backhaul' land-based network connects to areas of high demand, which are usually centres of high population density, rather than the usually remote locations of cable landing points/landing stations/termination stations. A good example of this is the Endeavour cable system which connects Australia to Hawaii. The cable landing point in Sydney is Tamarama Beach, some distance from the cable termination station in Paddington. For power cables the term cable termination station is not strictly determined. It is either the point where the underwater cable ends and where the overhead powerline starts or if the whole line is implemented as cable, the first cable sleeve on the land. However one can also say that the substation or HVDC static inverter plant, where the connection to the grid is made describe as cable termination station. However, this station can be far away from the coast.

The benefits of improved climate control and security are traded off against increased mechanical complexity, cost, weight and often reduced luggage capacity. A 2006 New York Times article suggested the retractable hardtop may herald the demise of the textile-roofed convertible, and a 2007 Wall Street Journal article suggested \\"more and more convertibles are eschewing soft cloth tops in favor of sophisticated folding metal roofs, making them practical in all climates, year-round.\\"  History  Peugeot 402 Eclipse Decapotable (1938) 1934 Lancia Belna Eclipse 1934 Peugeot 601 C Eclipse 1958 Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner while roof is in the demonstration position. 1919 Ben P. Ellerbeck conceived a retractable hardtop – a manually operated system on a Hudson coupe that allowed unimpeded use of the rumble seat even with the top down – but never saw production. 1934 Lancia introduced the first production, power-operated retractable hardtop in 1934, the Belna Eclipse, designed and patented by Georges Paulin. The Belna was a French-built Lancia Augusta. The French coachbuilder, Marcel Pourtout, custom- built examples of Paulin's designs on other makes like Panhard and Peugeot 401, 402 or 601. 1941 Chrysler introduced a retractable hardtop concept car, the Chrysler Thunderbolt. 1953 Ford Motor Company spent an estimated US$2 million (US$ in dollars) to engineer a Continental Mark II with a servo- operated retractable roof. The project was headed by Ben Smith, a 30-year-old draftsman. The concept was rejected for cost and marketing reasons. Engineering work was recycled to the Ford Division which used the retractable mechanism in their 1957-1959 flagship Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner after an estimated US$18 million (US$ in dollars) more was spent. 1955 Brothers Ed and Jim Gaylord showed their first prototype at the 1955 Paris motor show, but the car failed to reach production. 1957 Ford introduced the Fairlane 500 Skyliner in the United States. A total of 48,394 were built from 1957 to 1959. The retractable top was noted for its complexity and usually decent reliability in the pre-transistor era. Its mechanism contained 10 power relays, 10 limit switches, four lock motors, three drive motors, eight circuit breakers, as well as of electrical wire, and could raise or lower the top in about 40 seconds. The Skyliner was a halo car with little luggage space (i.e., practicality), and cost twice that of a baseline Ford sedan. 1989 Toyota introduced a modern retractable hardtop, the MZ20 Soarer Aerocabin. The car featured an electric folding hardtop and was marketed as a 2-seater with a cargo area behind the front seats. Production was 500 units. 1995 The Mitsubishi GTO Spyder by ASC was marketed in the U.S. The design was further popularized by such cars as the 1996 Mercedes-Benz SLK. and 2001 Peugeot 206 CC. 2006 Peugeot presented a concept four-door retractable hardtop convertible, the Peugeot 407 Macarena. Produced by French coachbuilding specialist Heuliez, the Macarena's top can be folded in about 30 seconds. It has a reinforcing beam behind the front seats which incorporates LCD screens into the crossmember for the rear passengers.  Construction  BMW 3-series (E93) Retractable hardtops are commonly made from between two and five sections of metal or plastic and often rely on complex dual-hinged trunk/boot lids that enable the trunk lid to both receive the retracting top from the front and also receive parcels or luggage from the rear. The trunk also often includes a divider mechanism to prevent loading of luggage that would conflict with the operation of the hardtop. = Variations = * The Volkswagen Eos features a five-segment retractable roof where one section is itself an independently sliding transparent sunroof. * The Mercedes SL hardtop features a glass section that rotates during retraction to provide a more compact \\"stack.\\" * The third-generation Mazda MX-5 was available with an optional power retractable hardtop, in lieu of the standard folding-textile soft-top. Compared to the regular soft-top, the hardtop weighed more yet had no reduction in cargo capacity. The MX-5 was one of the few cars offering both hardtop and soft-top convertible choices. The hardtop roof was constructed of polycarbonate and manufactured by the German firm Webasto. * The Chrysler Sebring's (and its successor the Chrysler 200's) retractable hardtop also is marketed alongside a soft-top. According to development engineer Dave Lauzun, during construction, the Karmann-made tops are dropped into a body that is largely identical: both soft-top and retractable feature the same automatic tonneau cover, luggage divider and luggage space. The retractable does feature an underbody cross-brace not included in the softtop.  Comparison with soft tops  The retractable hardtop's advantages include: * More weatherly when roof is raised * More secure than fabric tops * Increased structural rigidity * May enable consolidation/simplification of a manufacturer's car lineup; for instance the BMW Z4 (E89) was offered only as a coupé-convertible (hardtop), compared to the preceding E85 generation that had separate coupé and cabriolet (soft-top) variants. The retractable hardtop's disadvantages include: * Higher initial cost * Increased mechanical complexity * Potentially diminished passenger and trunk space compared to a soft-top convertible. * Higher weight and center of gravity than soft-top convertibles, potentially reducing handling. * Potential need for more than minimum clearance while operating the hardtop. For example, the Volvo C70 requires of vertical clearance during operation, the Cadillac XLR requires of vertical clearance and the Mercedes SLK's trunk lid extends rearward while lowering or lifting the top.

Early life  Ana was the youngest of four children, two brothers and two sisters, born to Margarit and Sofia Aslan. Ana was said to be a very intellectual child, learning to read and write already by age four. At the age of 13, her father died, and her family then moved to Bucharest, Romania. It was in Bucharest where she began her studies. She graduated from the Central School of Bucharest in 1915. The premature death of her father, whom she was close to, was said to be the reason she wanted to become a physician. Although the medical field was not a desirable field for women to enter, Ana Aslan decided that was the path she wanted to pursue and attended the Faculty of Medicine from 1915 to 1922. Her mother did not support this decision of becoming a physician because of financial strains, so Ana Aslan went on a hunger strike until her mother accepted her medical career. During her time in undergraduate studies, she attended to soldiers as a nurse during the First World War.  Research  After graduating from the Faculty of Medicine in 1922, she began working with Daniel Danielopolu who supervised her doctoral thesis. She obtained her M.D. degree in cardiovascular physiology in 1924. Her focus was on physiology and the process of aging. While experimenting on the effects that procaine had on arthritis, Aslan discovered other beneficial effects of this drug. It was this discovery that led to a three-year study and eventual invention of her drug called Gerovital (H3), which she prescribed for the effects of aging. With hesitation from fellow scientists that Gerovital was a \\"fountain of youth\\", Aslan kicked off a research study to prove the results. Over a period of two years, blood samples were taken from 15,000 people, with some of them receiving Gerovital and some receiving a placebo. 40% of the people who took Gerovital had less sick-leave days, and mortality rate from the flu epidemic was 13% in placebo patients while only being 2.7% in patients who took the drug. In 1976, with a pharmacist named Elena Polovrăgeanu, they invented another drug named Aslavital, which was a similar drug to Gerovital aimed to delay the skin aging process.  Awards  Aslan on a 2016 Romanian stamp Aslan on a 1996 Romanian stamp Ana Aslan received many international distinctions for her research activity, for example: * \\"Cross of Merit\\" – First Class of the Order of Merit, Germany, 1971 * \\"Cavalier de la Nouvelle Europe\\" Prize Oscar, Italy, 1973 * \\"Les Palmes Academiques\\", France, 1974 * \\"Honorary Foreign Citizen and Honorary Professor of Sciences\\", Philippines, 1978 * \\"Member Honoris Causa\\" Diploma of the Bohemo-Slovakian Society of Gerontology, 1981 * \\"Leon Bernard\\" Prize, important distinction granted by the World Health Organization upon nomination and endorsement by officials of a member state (in this case by the Romanian Nicolae Ceauşescu) for contributing to the development of gerontology and geriatrics, 1982  Cosmetic lines  Ana Aslan patented two cosmetic products (hair lotion and cream Gerovital H3), entrusting their production to Farmec company and Miraj. The two companies have since diversified their range of cosmetics, and traditional procaine hydrochloride was eliminated from the formula.Branciulescu, Adina Elixirul Anei Aslan, National Geographic Romania. Legacy  Ana Aslan was considered a pioneer of social medicine. Years after becoming the head of the physiology department at the Institute of Endocrinology of Bucharest, she founded the Institute of Geriatrics of Bucharest. Ana Aslan is known for coining the term “gerontology”, and in 1959 organized the Romanian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics. The Romanian Society of Gerontology was the first in the world to channel its research into clinic, experimental, and social researches, devise a therapeutic strategy to prevent the process of aging, and organize and national health network for the prevention of aging. Her drug was used by many famous politicians and celebrities around the world, including John F. Kennedy.

Early life  Argüello was born in León, he studied fine arts at the Royal Academy of San Fernando in Madrid, and in 1959 was awarded a Special National Prize for Painting. In 1964 he began the Neocatechumenal Way in the slum of Palomeras Altas in Madrid. Crisis and Conversion At the Royal Academy Argüello went through a profound existential crisis, of which he gave a vivid account in an interview. He wondered how it was possible \\"that we live in a world full of injustices when inside we have a desire for justice.\\" Through his involvement with a theatre group, he \\"learned something of the philosophy of Sartre, (No Exit, The Flies, etc.), and in the end Sartre gives us an answer: that the world is absurd, everything is absurd, that we have a craving for justice and live in an unjust world because everything is absurd.\\" Argüello tried to live \\"consciously, existentially\\" the \\"reality\\" of Sartrian atheism. He dedicated himself to art, won a National Prize, and appeared on television, but to his surprise \\"it meant absolutely nothing\\" to him. \\"In the end I asked myself: but people, how can they live if I can't?... I'd get up and say: to live, for what? To paint. And why paint? To make money. What for, if nothing satisfies me? I knew that sooner or later I'd shoot myself, I'd kill myself.\\" At the height of this crisis, however, Argüello read another philosopher, Bergson, \\"who says that intuition is a... way..., deeper than reason itself, of arriving at truth. And, surprised, I found that, deep inside, my artist's intuition did not accept the absurdity of existence; I was aware of the beauty of a tree, of the beauty of things; there is something there that can't be absurd. Then if the absurd is not the truth, if there is a reason for being... the next step was: then somebody created us.... At that moment... something in me told me that God existed,... that God loved me,... that I was a son of God. And with great surprise I found... that this God that appeared in my heart, in my deepest soul, was Jesus Christ, the Jesus Christ of the Catholic Church.\\" Summing up this period of his life during his meeting with Pope John Paul II in Rome on November 2, 1980, Argüello said, \\"God permitted me to experience the absurd – atheism – until he had mercy.\\" After his conversion he determined to dedicate his life to Jesus and to the Church. He began to frequent catechism courses and for years he trained as a catechist. Convinced that Jesus is present in the suffering of the poorest of people and inspired by the example of Charles de Foucauld, Argüello abandoned his studies and career as a painter. Taking only his guitar, crucifix, and Bible, he left to live amongst the poor in a wooden shack in Palomeras Altas, a slum on the outskirts of Madrid. The Origins It was among the poor of Palomeras that Kiko encountered Carmen Hernández, a graduate in chemistry and theology. Thanks to the liturgist Father Farnés Schrerer, they got in touch with the liturgical renewal of the Second Vatican Council and the centrality of the Easter Vigil. They developed a style of preaching adequate to the environment in which the poor were living and they formed a small Christian Community. This first community was mainly composed of gypsies, illiterates, vagabonds, prostitutes, and unemployed people who were drawn by the discovery of the love Christ had for them despite their sins. Through contact with other parishes embracing different standards of living, little by little a Way of Christian Initiation was begun for adults who were rediscovering the richness of their Baptism. Kiko Argüello and Neocatechumenal Way today Kiko in Montreal, Canada (March 2017) After more than thirty years of work in more than a hundred countries, this Neocatechumenate was recognized by Pope John Paul II as an \\"effective means of Catholic formation for society and the present time.\\" Kiko Argüello, Maria Ascension and the Italian Father Mario Pezzi are presently the international team responsible for the Neocatechumenal Way worldwide. Its statutes were approved ad experimentum for a period of five years in June 2002. The Statutes, with minimal changes, were given final approval by the Church on June 13, 2008.Neocatechumenate Gets Final Approval  Zenit Today the Neocatechumenal Way is present in more than 110 countries in all the six continents, in nearly 900 dioceses, and in around 8,000 parishes with more than 30,000 communities, 19,000 of which are found in Europe, 10,000 being in Italy. Fruits of the Neocatechumenal Way were recognized by various Catholic universities and institutes through conferring of honorary degrees on Kiko Argüello. On May 13, 2009, he was invested with an honorary degree by the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family. The institute underlined \\"the strong commitment of the Neocatechumenal Way on family issues\\" by its emphasis on \\"the experience of the 'domestic celebration' with which it sends families on a mission.\\" It also pointed out the value of the lay group's \\"promotion, together with other ecclesiastical organizations, of major initiatives in support of the family,\\" especially the \\"Family Day in Italy and the 2007 Feast of the Holy Family in Madrid.\\"Neocatechumenal Way Founder Awarded DoctorateZenit On June 26, 2013, Argüello received an honorary degree from the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin. The University invested him with the honorary doctorate in recognition of his contribution to the renewal of the Church following the indications of the Second Vatican Council, underlining the fruits of the Neocatechumenal Way in the evangelization and in defending the values of human dignity and Christian family.Neocatechumenal Way Initiator Receives Honorary Doctorate from John Paul II Catholic University in Poland  Zenit On May 15, 2015, Kiko Argüello together with Carmen Hernández received his third honorary doctorate from the Catholic University of America. During the ceremony, the president of the University John H. Garvey quoted the words of Pope Francis addressed to Kiko and Carmen, saying: \\"I thank you for the immense good you are doing for the whole Church.\\" The doctorate was awarded mainly \\"for their devotion to the poor, which has brought so many into communion with Christ and the Catholic faith.\\"Kiko Argüello, Carmen Hernandez Receive Honorary Doctorate from Catholic University of America  Zenit Architecture, paintings and the liturgy Kiko in Montreal, Canada (March 2017) Through the years, Kiko Argüello has painted a large number of religious paintings, in several cities and localities, cathedrals, and churches. He is also a psalmist and has composed well over a hundred and eighty songs of a religious nature, for use in Neocatechumenal Way celebrations and liturgies. Thus an aesthetic renewal has taken place through paintings, architecture, music, songs, and liturgical ornaments. In Rome, Kiko has painted huge murals, in the crypt of the Church dedicated to the Canadian Martyrs (Ascension of Our Lord into Heaven), in the Church of Saint Frances Cabrini (Holy Trinity) and also in its crypt, and in the Church of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga (The Apparition of the Risen Christ to Saint Thomas). In Porto San Giorgio, the centre of the Neocatechumenal Way, near the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Loreto, the International Centre for the New Evangelisation has been built according to Argüello's design. He has set up as well a huge cross and an abstract painting of the Creation. He has also designed many of the 75 Redemptoris Mater Seminaries, especially those of Newark and Denver (USA), Rome, and Macerata (Italy), as well as the Neocatechumenal Centre in Madrid, amongst others. In Florence, he has painted the \\"Corona Misterica\\" behind the altar of the Church of San Bartolomeo in Tuto, and has designed, together with the Italian architect Alberto Durante, a Catechumenium (a structure encompassing several halls, intended to hold liturgies by the Neocatechumenal Communities and the Diocese). In the Parish of the Holy Trinity in Piacenza, he has painted one of the largest murals in the world (500 square metres). It represents the Glory of Christ Pantocrator, Resurrected, on a golden background. It was inaugurated in the presence of the local Bishop, an official of the Orthodox Church of Moscow and three Eastern Patriarchs. Interior of the Cathedral of Saint Mary the Royal of La Almudena, Madrid In Madrid, Kiko has also designed the architecture of various Cathecumeniums and has painted different themes in the Parishes of El Transito (The Dormition of Our Lady), of Saint Joseph (The Transfiguration), of La Paloma (he designed and painted the chapel dedicated to Pentecost); and at Saint Catherine Labouré (where he designed the architecture of the church together with the German architect Gottfried Klaiber) he painted the Story of Salvation on a golden background all around the temple. Additionally, in the parish of San Frontis de Zamora, he painted a round mural depicting the Birth of Jesus, his Baptism and his Resurrection. Holy Family of Nazareth Parish in Oulu, built by the Neocatechumenal Way. February 2006 In Finland, in the city of Oulu, he designed, together with the Swiss architect Gabriele Geronzi, the first parish church in a zone where there had never before been a Roman Catholic church. In Israel he designed, together with a team of architects (Antonio Abalos and Guillermo Soler, Spanish; Mattia Del Prete, Italian; and the above-mentioned Gottfried Klaiber), the grand building of the Domus Galilaeae (a centre of biblical formation and place to receive pilgrims to the Holy Land), where he painted the Last Judgement that decorates the church of this new building. Just before the royal wedding of Crown Prince Felipe of Spain, Kiko was commissioned by the Cardinal and Bishop to paint the interior of the Almudena Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Madrid and to replace the stained glass windows in time for the said wedding, in 2004. This work has turned out to be controversial, since it had previously been assigned by an open international call to the artist Manuel Ortega in January 1988.\\"The 'mysterious' disappearance of the original stained glass windows\\"  EL MUNDO Spanish Newspaper. Another issue arose when identical copies of the icons were found in a church in Arroyo Hondo, near Santo Domingo.\\"Kiko Argüello copied the stained glass windows\\"  EL MUNDO Spanish Newspaper. Kiko is the original artist and his work was duplicated in both the Cathedral and the said church. Those paintings, and many others, have been reproduced in numerous seminaries and churches and in the Domus Galilaeae Center.

History  The Ottakringer brewery was opened in 1837 by the master miller Heinrich Plank under the name of Planksche Brauerei, after the ruling diocese of Klosterneuburg had granted approval for brewing. In 1850, it was taken over and expanded into a large brewery by the cousins, Ignaz and Jakob Kuffner from Lundenburg. Within ten years, the production increased from 18,318 hl to 64,183 hl. When Kaiser Franz Joseph ordered that the city walls be pulled down and a large number of residential buildings began to be built, Ottakringer grew as well. A new fermentation cellar and a larger warehouse went into operation. Around 1890, the production was already at about 170,000 hl. Moriz von Kuffner, the son of Ignaz von Kuffner, took over the brewery in 1882 and increased the production to over 350,000 hl in the last year before the war, a quantity which was not again reached between the World Wars. In 1905, Kuffner converted the brewery into a joint-stock company. Even before the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Moriz von Kuffner was forced to sell his business because of his Jewish background. It was sold for a rather low price of 14 million Austrian schillings (about 36 million euros at today's values) to Gustav Harmer, who was also forced out of the business for two years after the war. After the liberation by the Allies, the brewery was temporarily managed by the Russians, before the Harmer family managed to legally prove their purchase and again manufactured 150,000 hl as of 1955. The heirs of Moriz von Kuffner, who had died in Zürich in the meantime, were compensated because of their expulsion and the threats of the Nazi regime, which had led to the sale of the business to the Harmer family. In 1977, the brewery considerably contributed to the breaking up of the beer cartel by withdrawing from it. From that time on, any restaurant could choose whichever beer brewery it wanted as a supplier, independently of its location. In 1986, Ottakringer was listed on the stock exchange. In 1989, bottling in the brown bottles usually used in Austria was stopped and Ottakringer was the first brewery in Austria to introduce the well-known green \\"shoulder bottles\\".Profile In 2007, the company initiated a joint partnership with an Iranian company to build a factory in Tehran for producing non-alcoholic beer.BBCPersian.com  Structure of the Company  The parent company, Ottakringer Holding AG, which is owned by families Wenckheim, Menz, Trauttenberg und Pfusterschmid, hold 88% shares of Ottakringer Getränke AG, the Ottakringer Getränke AG owns 6% of the shares, the rest of the shares are held in free float. The parent company also owns the mineral water manufacturer, Vöslauer, which is located in Bad Vöslau.  Products  The most popular brand is Ottakringer Helles, a beer with an alcohol content of 5.2% and a wort of 11.8° Plato. Other brands are the Goldfassl special beer or Goldfassl Pils, a light, pilsner-style beer, as well as the Ottakringer Radler, which is a mixture of 50% Helles and 50% lemonade. Also in the range of products is the nearly alcohol-free beer, Null Komma Josef, whose brandname is an allusion to its alcohol content of under 0.5%. In contrast, the brewery's strongest beer (7.6% alcohol) is the Ottakringer Bock, which is only produced for special occasions (Christmas and Easter). The company also produces Ottakringer Dunkles, a dark beer, Ottakringer G'mischtes, a mixture of light and dark beer, Ottakringer Zwickl, an unfiltered light beer, and Ottakringer Zwickl Rot, a darker unfiltered beer brewed with melanoidin malt.  Trivia  16er Blech The Viennese have a special expression for the canned beer, 16er-Blech (16-plate), mainly for the Ottakringer Helles. The expression, 16er-Hüs'n, is also used for both the bottled and the canned beer. These are references to the origin of the beer in the 16th district of Vienna and the can that contains it. In the beginning of 2007, the brewery took advantage of this and marketed a new kind of canned beer under the name of 16er Blech. Various rooms of the brewery can also be used as an event location. The brewery has sponsored the Austrian football champions SK Rapid Wien for many years.

The network at one time consisted of over of pipeline and 46 other facilities. However, several of these facilities were closed before the GPSS was sold in 2015 and a number of the pipelines were mothballed and later abandoned. Earlier the total number of facilities on the GPSS was much larger than 46. For example, in 1989 there were 40 Petroleum Storage Depots in operation plus large numbers of other facilities such as pump-stations, junctions, and ingress and egress points.Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017. It is interconnected with some other commercial pipeline systems. Pre World War II planning As part of the planning and preparations for World War II, the Air Ministry realised that the ability to distribute aviation fuel to the Royal Air Force (RAF)'s aircraft and petrol to its ground support vehicles was essential to sustaining any battle, in which superiority would be gained mainly in the air. In 1936, however, the RAF only possessed fuel reserves of 8,000 tons. These were at the time estimated to be enough for 10 days of war but in reality would have only represented one day of peak wartime usage.The Royal Air Force Builds for War - A History of Design and Construction in the RAF 1935 - 1945 p270. The Stationery Office Authorisation was given to build a series of fuel storage depots with semi-buried tanks in them that would be protected against aerial attack. Initially in 1936 the figure was set at 90,000 tons but this had been increased to 800,000 tons by 1938. By the start of World War II in 1939, a number of these new protected storage depots were already operational.A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p5 (Paper 1980). However, no pipelines were constructed until after the war started, with the first being built in 1941.D.J.Payton-Smith: Oil - A Study of War-time Policy and Administration p225. HMSO SBN 11 630074 4 National pipeline system With the declaration of war and as pre-planned, the Petroleum Board came into operation with all former staff of the separate petrol companies coming under the Petroleum Board. The entire operation of fuel supplies was controlled from Shell Mex House in London.Petroleum at War - The Wartime Story of the Petroleum Board 1956 A reprint of a series of Articles originally printed in the Petroleum Times. The programme for building protected storage tanks continued and increased with the bulk of construction being between 1940 and 1942. The value of these protected storage tanks can be seen in that whereas 500,000 tons of above ground tanks were destroyed as a result of German bombing, only two protected storage tanks [8,000 tons], in Poole and Falmouth, were destroyed.Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p27 and p29. As fuel imports into Great Britain increased it became more difficult for the existing road and rail network to meet the demand to transfer the fuel eastwards and southwards from the west coast ports, the east coast fuel import facilities were closed because of the bombing. In April 1941 the go ahead was given for the construction of an oil pipeline from Avonmouth, where a large number of new protected storage tanks had been constructed, to the Thames (A/T pipeline). Concern as to the vulnerability of the fuel import facilities, led to the construction in 1942 of a pipeline linking the import facilities in the Stanlow area with those at Avonmouth.D.J.Payton-Smith: Oil - A Study of War- time Policy and Administration p225 and 226. HMSO SBN 11 630074 4 This was followed by the construction of a pipeline running from off the A/T pipeline to the Southampton area for the stockpiling of fuel for the possible second front (R/H pipeline). During 1943 an entire ring-main linking the River Mersey, the Avonmouth area, the River Thames and up to the Humber area, was constructed. This was later extended into East Anglia to supply both the RAF and the United States Army Air Force (USAAF).Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p49, p51 to 53 and p62 to 65. Linked to the GPSS were the cross-channel PLUTO pipelines which ran from the Isle of Wight to Cherbourg (code named BAMBI) and from Dungeness to Boulogne (code named DUMBO). The R/H pipeline had already been constructed but to supply DUMBO a new pipeline was built from the Thames to Dungeness in 1943.Sir Donald Banks: Flame over Britain p186. The success of the PLUTO was, however, limited with only 8% of the fuel delivered between D-Day and VE Day being via them.Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p84 and p62 to 65. The official history states of them that 'PLUTO contributed nothing to Allied supplies at a time that would have been most valuable' and 'DUMBO was more valuable, but at a time when success was of less importance.' D.J.Payton- Smith: Oil - A Study of War-time Policy and Administration p448. HMSO SBN 11 630074 Post World War II Immediately following the end of the war, most of the system was mothballed with surplus fuel disposed of, sites were reduced to minimum manning, and the pipelines filled with water.A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p7 (Paper 1980). However, this changed with the Cold War and the decision taken to recommission the network. One person working on bringing one previously mothballed storage depot back into operation related how it was buried beneath rubbish and long grass.'This is My Life' in Pipevine Issue No 10 December 1978. 'Pipevine' was the in-house magazine of the British Pipelines Agency from 1976 to 1992. Two new fuel importation complexes were built in the 1950s, one to the south west of Bristol and one in the Stanlow area. A very large storage depot using salt caverns was constructed in Cheshire for storing both crude and refined oils.A.L.Adams: Storage of Government Oil Reserves in Salt Cavities - Paper given to the SMRI in October 1982 On being recommissioned, the cross-Pennines pipeline was found to be badly corroded and in the 1950s a new pipeline was built from the Stanlow area to the Humber. New storage depots were built on this pipeline and a third new import facility was constructed on the Humber.Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p95 to p101. The first commercial usage of the system was immediately after the war to supply a depot on the River Severn from Avonmouth.A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p7 (Paper 1980). In the early 1950s some aviation fuel was pumped from Avonmouth to a depot on the River Thames to supply Heathrow Airport by road tanker from there. Esso also used the network to pump aviation fuel from the Fawley refinery to the Thames depot to supply Heathrow. The late 1950s also saw a spur off one of the PLUTO pipelines, originally from the Thames to Dungeness, brought back into operation to pump fuel from the Isle of Grain to the Thames Depot. From there aviation fuel was carried to Heathrow Airport, no longer by road tanker but via the first commercial pipeline which was constructed by Shell-Mex and BP in 1959.A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p8 (Paper 1980). In 1967 an agreement was reached with Conoco for leasing five petroleum storage depots for road loading of ground fuels. These were all supplied from the Immingham refinery which was connected to the GPSS pipeline network. During the late 1970s and early 1980s two commercial road loading facilities and two additional refineries were also connected to the GPSS.Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p115 to 117. There were a substantial number of depots that were not on the pipeline network. In the 1970s most of these were closed down. In the 1980s it was decided by the government that large scale strategic storage of petroleum as a civil reserve was no longer required. The salt cavities and some of the storage depots previously used for civil reserve storage were either closed or leased commercially.Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p126 to 133 and 141 to 142. The management of civil storage depots and the pipeline network initially came under the Board of Trade and then in 1942 under the Ministry of Power. This became the Department of Energy in the 1970s. In 1975 the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) was set up and took over the running of the department's system.A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p9 (Paper 1980). In 1985 the government closed BNOC but kept the GPSS and the Oil & Pipelines Agency (OPA) was set up purely to manage the GPSS.HMSO: The Oil and Pipelines Act 1985 Air Ministry storage depots and spur pipelines had been managed by the ministry and later by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) but in 1989 it was decided by the government to merge these sites and pipelines with the rest of the GPSS under the management of OPA.Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p149 to 150. Although the GPSS remained officially secret until the end of the Cold War, knowledge of it was in fact already in the public domain through the publication of various books an papers such as the Official History, Adams' papers and the series of articles in the Petroleum Times - 'Petroleum at War'. Private-sector usage was encouraged, but limited; the OPA's task was to provide \\"maximum development of private sector usage of the GPSS, provided this did not impinge upon its primary purpose of supplying the required fuel for defence purposes and did not require capital investment from public funds.\\" As a result, the pipeline was extended and developed to allow connection to: all UK-based oil refineries and major fuel processing depots; as well as all major civilian airports - including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Manchester - during the period of the Cold War. As a result of the 2000 fuel protests, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon instructed the MoD to plan for extension of the GPSS to beat any future fuel blockade.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/apr/06/uk.oil Operations During World War II to protect the pipeline from damage or look for possible leaks, a team of men and women was employed to patrol the pipeline. Each person was responsible for a section of pipeline eight to ten miles long.Pathe News - Trans-Britain Pipeline This was clearly very manpower intensive and later it was possible to use commercial not RAF helicopters to patrol the pipelines on a fortnightly basis and helicopter landing pads were constructed on the depots. In the 1950s a means of preventing pipeline corrosion known as cathodic protection became available. This applies a voltage to the pipeline such that the natural electrical action which takes place between pipe and soil leading to corrosion is reversed. Cathodic protection was applied to the pipeline system on a rolling programme which started in 1954 and was completed in 1970.Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 2017 p121. After the war the locations of the pipelines were marked with identification posts with bright yellow roofs with a thick black line. Even so, in March 2000 at Furness Vale near Whaley Bridge, High Peak, Derbyshire one of the lines was cut by workmen. Privatisation In May 2012 the UK Government announced plans to sell all or part of the GPSS and legislation to enable it to do so was included in the Energy Act 2013. Three years after announcing the plan to sell GPSS, on 20 March 2015, the GPSS was acquired by Spanish oil network operator CLH for £82 million. The MoD also signed a contract with CLH for the military to be continued to be supplied with fuel via the GPSS. It was stated that over the next ten years the MoD would pay £237 million for the use of the system.Government Pipeline and Storage System Sale Update: Written statement - HCWS434 made on 20 March 2015. MoD had previously paid nothing for the use of the GPSS and also gained from the surplus of income over expenditure that OPA used to generate from running the GPSS.Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 p205 published 2017. The sale did not include the six coastal Oil Fuel Depots owned by the MoD, which continued to be operated and maintained by the residual OPA. Following its acquisition by CLH, the GPSS was subsequently renamed the CLH Pipeline System. Since CLH have taken over the ownership of the GPSS a number of the pipelines that make up the system have been closed down.https://www.airfieldresearchgroup.org.uk/forum/fuel- depots/5499-government-pipelines-and-storage-system-gpss?start=220#151415 See also *UK oil pipeline network *Oil terminals in the United Kingdom *Petroleum Board References Further reading * Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017. * D.J.Payton-Smith: Oil - A Study of War-time Policy and Administration.

It is the relationship between output that is produced with the installed equipment, and the potential output which could be produced with it, if capacity was fully used.The Formula is the actual output per period all over full capacity per period expressed as a percentage. Engineering and economic measures One of the most used definitions of the \\"capacity utilization rate\\" is the ratio of actual output to the potential output. But potential output can be defined in at least two different ways. =Engineering definition= One is the \\"engineering\\" or \\"technical\\" definition, according to which potential output represents the maximum amount of output that can be produced in the short run with the existing stock of capital. Thus, a standard definition of capacity utilization is the (weighted) average of the ratios between the actual output of firms and the maximum that could be produced per unit of time, with existing plant and equipment (see Johanson 1968). Output could be measured in physical units or in market values, but normally it is measured in market values. However, as output increases and well before the absolute physical limit of production is reached, most firms might well experience an increase in the average cost of production—even if there is no change in the level of plant & equipment used. For example, higher average costs can arise because of the need to operate extra shifts, to undertake additional plant maintenance, and so on. =Economic definition= An alternative approach, sometimes called the \\"economic\\" utilization rate, is, therefore, to measure the ratio of actual output to the level of output beyond which the average cost of production begins to rise. In this case, surveyed firms are asked by how much it would be practicable for them to raise production from existing plant and equipment, without raising unit costs (see Berndt & Morrison 1981). Typically, this measure will yield a rate around 10 percentage points higher than the \\"engineering\\" measure, but time series show the same movement over time. =Measurement= Capacity utilization (black line) in manufacture in the United States, unemployment rate (red line, upside down, scale on the right), employment rate (dotted line) Capacity utilization in manufacturing in the FRG and in the USA In economic statistics, capacity utilization is normally surveyed for goods-producing industries at plant level. The results are presented as an average percentage rate by industry and economy-wide, where 100% denotes full capacity. This rate is also sometimes called the \\"operating rate\\". If the operating rate is high, this is called \\"full capacity\\", while if the operating rate is low, a situation of \\"excess capacity\\" or \\"surplus capacity\\" exists. The observed rates are often turned into indices. Capacity utilization is much more difficult to measure for service industries. There has been some debate among economists about the validity of statistical measures of capacity utilization, because much depends on the survey questions asked, and on the valuation principles used to measure output. Also, the efficiency of production may change over time, due to new technologies. For example, Michael Perelman has argued in his 1989 book Keynes, Investment Theory and the Economic Slowdown: The Role of Replacement Investment and q-Ratios that the US Federal Reserve Board measure is just not very revealing. Prior to the early 1980s, he argues, American business carried a great deal of extra capacity. At that time, running close to 80% would indicate that a plant was approaching capacity restraints. Since that time, however, firms scrapped much of their most inefficient capacity. As a result, a modern 77% capacity utilization now would be equivalent to a historical level of 70%. Economic significance If market demand grows, capacity utilization will rise. If demand weakens, capacity utilization will slacken. Economists and bankers often watch capacity utilization indicators for signs of inflation pressures. It is often believed that when the utilization rate rises above somewhere between 82% and 85%, price inflation will increase. Excess capacity means that insufficient demand exists to warrant expansion of output. All else constant, the lower capacity utilization falls (relative to the trend capacity utilization rate), the better the bond market likes it. Bondholders view strong capacity utilization (above the trend rate) as a leading indicator of higher inflation. Higher inflation—or the expectation of higher inflation—decreases bond prices, often prompting a higher yield to compensate for the higher expected rate of inflation. Implicitly, the capacity utilization rate is also an indicator of how efficiently the factors of production are being used. Much statistical and anecdotal evidence shows that many industries in the developed capitalist economies suffer from chronic excess capacity. Critics of market capitalism, therefore, argue the system is not as efficient as it may seem, since at least 1/5 more output could be produced and sold, if buying power was better distributed. However, a level of utilization somewhat below the maximum typically prevails, regardless of economic conditions. =Modern business cycle theory= The notion of capacity utilization was introduced into modern business cycle theory by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988). They illustrated how capacity utilization is important for getting business cycle correlations in economic models to match the data when there are shocks to investment spending. Output gap percentage formula As a derivative indicator, the \\"output gap percentage\\" (%OG) can be measured as the gap between actual output (AO) and potential output (PO) divided by potential output and multiplied by 100%: :%OG = [(AO – PO)/PO] × 100%. FRB and ISM utilization indexes In the survey of plant capacity used by the US Federal Reserve Board for the FRB capacity utilization index, firms are asked about \\"the maximum level of production that this establishment could reasonably expect to attain under normal and realistic operating conditions, fully utilizing the machinery and equipment in place.\\" By contrast, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) index asks respondents to measure their current output relative to \\"normal capacity\\", and this yields a utilization rate, which is between 4 and 10 percentage points higher than the FRB measure. Again, the time series show more or less the same historical movement. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System: Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization. Data The average economy-wide capacity utilization rate in the US since 1967 was about 81.6%, according to the Federal Reserve measure. The figure for Europe is not much different, for Japan being only slightly higher. The average utilization rate of installed productive capacity in industry, in some major areas of the world, was estimated in 2003/2004 to be as follows (rounded figures): =Average utilization rate= * United States 79.5% (April 2008 — Federal Reserve measure) * Japan 83–86% (Bank of Japan) * European Union 82% (Bank of Spain estimate) * Australia 80% (National Bank estimate) * Brazil 60–80% (various sources) * India 70% (Hindu business line) * China perhaps 60% (various sources) * Turkey 79.8% (September 2008 — Turkish Statistical Institute) * Canada 87% (Statistics Canada) Notes References * E.

Important members included Charles Pasqua, part of the Gaullist movement and known as Jacques Chirac's mentor, Etienne Léandri, a friend of Pasqua, or Christian Fouchet. The predecessor of the SAC was the service of order of the Rassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF) Gaullist party. The SAC was dissolved in 1982 under François Mitterrand's government, after a particularly gruesome multiple murder triggered by internal rivalries.  Foundation during the Algerian War  The SAC was officially created as a 1901 law association on 4 January 1960, in the proclaimed aim of providing unconditional support to de Gaulle's policy. It was then officially directed by Pierre Debizet, a former Resistant, but its real leader was Jacques Foccart, in charge of the African policy of France for several decades. The SAC recruited among the Gaullist movement, but also in the organized crime. Etienne Léandri, a friend of Charles Pasqua, was thus a former Collaborationist, reconverted in illegal drug trade and protected by the Central Intelligence Agency for his anti-communist activities. Others famous gangsters of the time who were SAC members include or Christian David (\\"le beau Serge\\"). Some of these criminals had taken part in the Resistance during the war, and even been deported, thus creating lasting links with future politicians, while others had been collaborationists. The SAC always was independent from the Gaullist party itself, directly reporting to General de Gaulle through Foccart. The Parliamentary report published in 1982 talked of \\"God without the clergy\\" (\\"'\\"). After de Gaulle's change of policy concerning the Algerian War (1954-1962) and his subsequent support of Algerian independence, many SAC members, supporters or outright activists of \\"French Algeria\\" resigned. Pierre Debizet, official director of the SAC, was replaced by , a bodyguard of de Gaulle. General de Gaulle then sent the SAC against the Organisation armée secrète (OAS) terrorist group which launched a campaign of bombings and assassinations to try to block the implementation of the March 1962 Evian agreements on a cease-fire with the National Liberation Front (FLN).  1960s: May 1968 and the \\"disappearance\\" of Mehdi Ben Barka  After this period, which saw the longtime Gaullists quit the organisation, the SAC began to recruit more and more from underworld groups. It then became involved in all sorts of shady moves and covert actions for the Gaullist party. It has been suspected of participating in 1965 in the \\"disappearance\\" in Paris of Mehdi Ben Barka, leader of the Moroccan opposition to King Hassan II and of the Tricontinental Conference. Furthermore, and Ali Bourequat, \\"disappeared\\" under Hassan II, have accused the SAC of financing itself by drug trade with Morocco. During May 1968, SAC members, disguised as ambulance crew, took demonstrators to their headquarters, rue de Solférino, where they were beaten up. They then prepared the Gaullist counter-demonstration which assured de Gaulle of the support of (parts of) the French people. After the June 1968 legislative election, the SAC expelled from the Youth Centres (\\"Maisons des Jeunes\\") various movements and associations, including the Maoists and the so- called \\"Katangais\\". Continuing this \\"policy of order\\", the SAC created in 1969 the right-wing students' union Union Nationale Inter-universitaire (UNI) in 1969 to counter the \\"leftist subversion\\" in the students' movement. Until 1976, the SAC supported the UNI in daily organisation, while many UNI members were also SAC members. Double membership of most activists continued after 1976, but the two organisations had distinct leadership. Jacques Foccart called back Pierre Debizet to the head of the SAC during May 1968. Foccart excluded Charles Pasqua in the beginning of 1969, suspecting him of trying to take control of the militia. Furthermore, Pierre Debizet decided to change the membership card, which looked too much like a police card, and requested from each member an extract of his judicial record. Despite this cleaning-up of the organisation in 1968-69, SAC members have had problems with the law between 1968 and 1981 for various reasons, including: \\"assault (coups et blessures volontaires), illegal possession of fire-arms, fraud, aggravated assault, money counterfeiting, pimping, racketeering, arson, blackmail, illegal drug trade, holdup, abuse of trust (abus de confiance - i.e. corruption), bombings, robberies and handling, being a member of a criminal organisation (association de malfaiteurs), degradation of vehicles, use of stolen cheques, outrage to public morality (outrage aux bonnes mœurs).\\" François Audigier, Histoire du SAC, p. 462 Some SAC members have upheld a theory of the \\"two SAC\\" to defend themselves, alleging the coexistence, under the same appellation, of on one hand a group of staunchly right-wing Gaullist activists, often recruiting honourable persons (a magistrate, a certain number of workers' activists often linked to \\"yellow trade-unions\\" such as the CGSI, the CFT or the CSL), and on the other hand individuals located at the cross-roads between intelligence activities, organized crime and far right movements, used for the most shady actions. In the 1970s, journalist Patrice Chairoff published in Libération left-wing newspaper, founded by Jean-Paul Sartre and others, a plan of the SAC envisioning the internment of leftists in stadiums. The document was attributed to the Marseillese , a lieutenant of Charles Pasqua who claimed it was a forgery.Quoted by Le Nouvel Observateur, 15 October 2005 One of the main roles of the SAC, although not well known, was the internal surveillance of the Gaullist party. The departmental responsible of the SAC was a de jure member of the departmental committee of the Union des Démocrates pour la République (UNR), then of the Union des Démocrates pour la République (UDR) and Rally for the Republic (RPR) (successive incarnations of the Gaullist party), even though he was often not an adherent of the Gaullist party. It is through this tight network covering France that Jacques Foccart was very well informed. On many times, the notes communicated to Pierre Debizet by his departmental responsibles permitted to push out of the Gaullist party elected (or not) officials of the party suspected of some illegal activities, before having the French justice take care of it. According to Daniele Ganser (2005), the SAC had Jacques Chirac as president in 1975. He later was twice prime minister before being elected president in 1995.See Daniele Ganser, Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe, Franck Cass, London, 2005, p.101  1981 Auriol massacre and the dissolving of the SAC  Pierre Debizet, national leader of the SAC, arrived in Marseille in May 1981, troubled by local rivalries within his organisation. Jacques Massié, a police inspector and the local leader of the SAC, was accused of corruption, and worse, of contacts with the left, by those who later would assassinate him. He was in reality a competent police officer, who was to take the leadership of the SAC in the Bouches-du-Rhône with the support of Debizet. Some time afterward, Massié and all of his family were massacred on the night of July 18, 1981 in what is known as the \\"Auriol massacre\\". A few weeks later, his murderers were arrested. Pierre Debizet was interrogated by the police, but eventually released without charges. The five SAC members of the Auriol commando were sentenced on May 1, 1985 to between 15 years of prison and life-sentences; the mastermind behind inspector Massié's murder was never identified.\\"Un beau travail d'action civique\\", in Le Canard Enchaîné #4441, December 7, 2005 The Auriol massacre took place soon after the 1981 election of François Mitterrand, candidate of the Socialist Party (PS). That election was the first victory of the left-wing since the 1958 establishment of the Fifth Republic by De Gaulle. The parliamentary majority set up a parliamentary investigative commission, in which the opposition refused to sit. That Commission did not request the dissolving of the SAC, which the National Assembly nonetheless debated. The government disbanded the SAC in 1982,Décret n°82-670 du 3 août 1982 portant dissolution de l'association nommée « Service d'action civique » (SAC) using a law which allows disbanding combat groups and private militias.  Successors of the SAC  After the 1982 dissolving of the SAC, Charles Pasqua, future Interior Minister, created the \\"Solidarité et défense des libertés\\" organisation (\\"Solidarity and Defense of Freedoms\\"), which gathered RPR and Union for French Democracy (UDF) members, former SAC activists and even some members of far-right movements such as the \\"Parti des forces nouvelles\\" (PFN, Party of the New Forces). This descendant of the SAC was quickly dissolved. After the 1982 bombing of the rue Marbœuf, it organised a demonstration during which activists of the Centre national des indépendants et paysans (CNIP) and of the PFN distinguished themselves. Furthermore, Pierre Debizet created the Mouvement initiative et liberté (MIL, Movement of Initiative and Freedom) after the May 1981 presidential election, but before the dissolving of the SAC in 1982. Rather than a resurgence of the SAC, it was thus more a parallel structure of the UNI estudiantine trade-union, which was supposed to assist SAC activists in finding more mainstream, professional activities, by entering the estudiantine movement. In the early 1980s, the SAC also had some front organisations, such as the private security firm VHP Security, which had as subsidiary KO International Company, charged of the personal security of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front (FN). Ante Gotovina, indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on charges of war crimes, had worked for KO International Company.Le général croate Gotovina arrêté en Espagne, RFI, 8 December 2005 Le chauffeur de l’homme de la Question, L'Humanité, 10 December 2005 References  In popular culture  * Films  The Day of the Jackal directed by Fred Zinnemann (1973)  Le Juge Fayard dit Le Shérif directed by Yves Boisset (1977)  J'ai vu tuer Ben Barka directed by Serge Le Péron (2005)  L'Affaire Ben Barka directed by Jean-Pierre Sinapi (2007)  Bibliography  *Report from the Parliamentary Commission on the SAC, Editions Alain Moreau, 1982 *François Audigier, Histoire du SAC, la part d'ombre du gaullisme, Stock, 2003 *Alex Panzani, La tuerie d'Auriol, J'ai lu, Crimes et enquètes. *Benjamin Biale, \\"Le service d'action civique : 1958-1968.\\", Mémoire IEP Aix-en-Provence 1997 *Pierre Péan L'Homme de l'ombre: éléments d'enquête autour de Jacques Foccart, l'homme le plus mystérieux et le plus puissant de la Ve République, Fayard, 1990.

It is the home ground of Serie A club Torino Football Club. The stadium is located in Piazzale Grande Torino, in the district of Santa Rita, in the south-central area of the city. The stadium is currently rated by UEFA as a Category 4 stadium, the highest ranking possible. Constructed in the 1930s, originally known as the Stadio Municipale Benito Mussolini (or colloquially the Stadio Municipale) and later the Stadio Comunale, it was the home of Juventus and Torino until 1990, when it was abandoned in favour of the Stadio delle Alpi. After a sixteen-year stint without Serie A football, the stadium was renovated and renamed the \\"Stadio Olimpico\\" on the occasion of the 2006 Winter Olympics. In a reversal of 1990, both Juventus and Torino moved back to the Olimpico, with Juventus using it until the end of the 2010–11 season, and Torino retaining it as their home stadium to the present day. History =The original project: Stadio Municipale Benito Mussolini= Aerial view of the Municipal stadium during the 1930s Originally named after Benito Mussolini, the stadium was built to host the Games of the year Littoriali XI, held in 1933 and the World Student Games in the same year. The Municipal Administration, to shorten the construction time, announced a contest, then divided the work among three companies: the stadium (stands, bleachers and local affairs) was entrusted to Company Saverio Parisi Rome (designed by the architect. Fagnoni and Eng. Bianchini and Ortensi), the athletic field, the Tower of Marathon and the ticket to 'Ing. Vannacci and Lucherini (project architect. Brenno Del Giudice, Professor. Colonnetti and the engineer. Vannacci), and the indoor pool to Company AN. Construction Companies Ing E. Faletti (project architect. Bonicelli and Ing. Villanova). L 'Ing. Guido De Bernardi undertook the preparation of fields and slopes. Work began in September 1932. The stadium was inaugurated on 14 May 1933 by the Secretary of the Party, Achille Starace, at the beginning of Littoriali. The first match played in the new stadium was between Juventus and Hungary's Újpest FC (6–2), the return leg of the quarter-finals of the Central European Cup, on 29 June 1933. =Stadio Mussolini during the 1930s= The original design stage consisted of a vast ring ellipsoid, whose major perimeter was about 640 metres. The base consisted of a bench of white granite, on which rested the socket in red plaster. The same materials were formed at 45° planes, that mark three strips of glass for lighting indoors, crowned by a white railing. Over this, large windows overlooked, restricted by concrete pillars that supported the terminal swing, projecting more than three metres, with an inclination of 45 degrees. The approaches were practised inside through openings 27, the main one of which led to the gallery, with cover from the weather. The parterre was partly covered by cantilevered terraces that adjective, and was slightly higher in the most distant from the field. The playing field measures 70 x 105 metres, surrounded by an athletics track with six lanes, mass pits for the shot put and discus throw, the track for the long jump and the top corner. Initially, the curves of the athletics track were designed at three centres. After protests from the national executive Massimo Cartasegna (who had participated as an athlete in the 1908 Olympics), they were redesigned to a single centre. The end result, however, was that the track had an abnormal length of 446.38 metres. =The post-war municipal stadium= After the Stadium's inauguration, it hosted several matches of the 1934 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Italy. In the 1934–35 season, the Stadio Olimpico di Torino began to host matches for the League Cup. From the late fifties, it hosted the home games of both Turin teams in the Italian championship, until 1989–1990, when the stadium was abandoned for the Stadio delle Alpi, built for World Cup Italy 1990. Between 1935 and 1986, Juventus were Italian champions 16 times, including five-in-a-row between 1931–1935, won 7 Italian Cups, several international titles, and one UEFA Cup (1976). For their part, between 1935 and 1976 Torino were 6 time Italian champions themselves (also with five in-a- row in the 1940s), and won 4 Italian Cups in the stadium. From 1938 until the late 1950s, the stadium also housed the headquarters of the provisional Automobile Museum (opened in 1939). In 1959 and 1970, it served as the main stadium of the Universiade and in 1980s the stadium was renamed \\"Vittorio Pozzo\\", in homage to the legendary coach who was twice World Champion with the Italy national football team in 1934 and 1938, who also coached Torino between 1912 and 1922. After the construction of Stadio delle Alpi, the Communal Stadium was used less and less up to be intended only to accommodate the Juventus coach (until 2003) And, since 2004 those of Turin. =The reconstruction for the 2006 Winter Olympics= The stadium during the 2006 Winter Olympics Following the agreements with the City, which entrusted the Stadio delle Alpi to Juventus, it was assigned to Municipal Stadium Torino, for reconstruction and to be operational in time to host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics. However, due to the non- registration of the company grenade Championship (sanctioned definitively 9 August 2005), the City of Turin is the owner of the stadium and returned to complete the reconstructure. The renovation project, consisting of two architects Verona Architect John Work Arteco and has maintained the existing structures, subject to the constraint of the Superintendency of Environmental and Architectural Heritage, and added new structures to withstand the vertical coverage of the entire plant, and a third ring of tiers, structurally continuous and cooperative coverage, with the corresponding part of the previous cover part 44 host closed boxes. Approximately one third of the lining of the roof is translucent plastic, so as to avoid as much as possible that the shadow cast by itself can damage the turf due to less sunlight. The total capacity is 27,168 seats, all covered and seated, lower than the original (originally the facility could accommodate 65,000 people standing) to meet modern safety standards. For ceremonies, expansion was made to 35,000 seats by temporary structures, plus construction of massive construction scenes for technical preparation of the Olympic flame. Many interior changes were made: the new main building on the ground floor of a commercial area of 1,163 square meters; in the north-west, also restored and relocated were the center of sports medicine, all services and offices. Outside was built a new Olympic Park and a new Olympic Sports Hall, designed by Arata Isozaki of Japan. The renovation of the stadium cost 30 million euros. The new Olympic Stadium was officially presented 29 November 2005, in a ceremony attended by representatives of local, government, the International Olympic Committee and TOROC. =Return of football (2006-)= A Torino match in 2007 In 2006, the stadium returned to hosting football matches of the two city teams, Torino and Juventus. In 2011, Juventus moved to its new stadium called Juventus Stadium on the site of Stadio delle Alpi. At the end of the ground-share, Torino can decide to purchase the facility and could rename it \\"Stadium Grande Torino\\", said Mario Pescante on the occasion of the inauguration of the renovated stadium. Despite having physically eliminated the athletics track (in its place is a carpet of synthetic grass), the distance between the stands and the pitch has not changed. This caused disappointment among fans, who would have preferred to have the stands closer to the field, as in England. However, during the restructuring a new parterre was built, bringing the crowd closer to the front rows. 80 seats are reserved for disabled spectators in wheelchairs, including 64 located in two tribunes raised in the parterre of the first ring of separate stations, 12 in the grandstand and 4 in the boxes. The Olympic Stadium was the first stadium in Italy to fully comply with the dictates of the \\"Pisanu Law\\" on stadium security. More than 80 surveillance cameras allow the police to locate and identify perpetrators of violence. The glass enclosure that separates the field from the spectators area, is mobile. It is high, but during games that do not raise risk of public policy may be lowered to . Furthermore, the use of technology was high: heating coils were placed below the field for use during cold temperatures and, in case of rain, an automatic system can cover the ground. During its first two years of use, from 2006 to 2008, two separate security zones separated the opposing fans; the actual capacity was limited to 25,500 seats. During the summer of 2008 there were held extensive renovations, in view of the return of Juventus to the Champions League. 1,350 new seats were installed, in four rows behind the first row of the gallery, creating a new ring on the area where the old track. To promote visibility of spectators in these new rows, barriers have been lowered to 1.10 meters, compared to the previous 2.20 meters. Finally, 650 seats were recovered with the downsizing of guest areas. The capacity thus became approximately 27,500 seats. During the summer of 2009, more work was performed. The parapet separation was lowered to 1.10 meters in all sectors and 444 new seats were added in the parterre, bringing the total stadium capacity to 27,994 seats. Moreover, in the summer of 2012, have been eliminated also the barriers that divided the Curva Maratona with Maratona Laterale (formerly the guest's sector in the home matches of Juventus in the same season moved to the new Juventus Stadium), allowing a further increase in capacity from 27,994 places in 2009, to 28,140 today. In April 2016, the Olimpico was renamed the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino in honour of the side from the 1940s. Stands =Curva Maratona (Curva Nord)= The Torre Maratona after the renovations This section of the stadium is traditionally occupied by the nuclei of the most heated organised supporters of Torino during home games. This name has been attributed to the presence, since the time of the Municipal Stadium, in the area behind the curve itself, of a high tower, actually called \\"Marathon Tower\\", which opened near the entrance reserved for athletes participating in various kolous athletic contests. =Curva Primavera (Curva Sud)= Torino fans in the Curva Primavera Since reopening the facility after the Winter Olympics in 2006, the south bend was renamed the Curva Primavera in honour of the Torino youth teams. In Italian, this literally translates to \\"Spring Curve\\". =Distinti Est= The Distinguished East (the east area of the stadium when Torino plays) of the Olympic Stadium in Turin has been the meeting place of families within the facility. On the left side is a separate sector, reserved for fans of visiting teams. =Distinti Ovest= The Distinguished West was the most expensive stand of the Olympic Stadium. This second level is reserved exclusively for journalists, commentators and prominent figures.

Launched in 1971 initially by Georgia Championship Wrestling, the program existed through various incarnations under different names before becoming WCW Saturday Night in 1992. Although initially the anchor show of the Turner Broadcasting-backed wrestling company, the September 1995 premiere of WCW Monday Nitro airing on sister station Turner Network Television usurped the show's once preeminent position in the company, as the primary source of storyline development and pay-per-view buildup. The show's place in the company was further devalued by the advent of WCW Thunder in 1998, airing on TBS and providing the secondary wrestling and storyline development that WCW Saturday Night had produced in the wake of Nitro burgeoning three-hour-long format. Once the cornerstone of the WCW wrestling empire, WCW Saturday Night ended its run in 2000 as the company struggled creatively to meet the demands of producing over six hours of new broadcast material on a weekly basis. The rights to WCW Saturday Night now belong to WWE as a result of that company's 2001 purchase of selected assets of WCW (including its video library). 59 episodes from 1992 to 1993 under the WCW Saturday Night banner are available on the streaming service WWE Network. Some previous episodes from 1985 to 1989 under the World Championship Wrestling banner were uploaded in 2015 and 2016 and are also available on WWE Network. History WCW Saturday Night premiered on April 4, 1992 as the showcase for the company's top talent. It grew out of two previous wrestling programs on TBS. Georgia Championship Wrestling began on the station (then known as WTCG- TV) in January 1972 and ran under that name until August 1982, when it became World Championship Wrestling. In addition, Best of World Championship Wrestling aired on Sundays, though it was frequently preempted. In spring 1988, TBS replaced it with a new Sunday wrestling show called NWA Main Event. In all of its incarnations, WCW Saturday Night would normally air for two hours. During baseball season, however, it would typically air for one hour, to be immediately followed by Braves TBS Baseball. =Georgia Championship Wrestling (1971–1982)= On December 25, 1971, Georgia Championship Wrestling aired its first show on upstart UHF independent station WTCG, owned by Turner Broadcasting System, as a Christmas special. Beginning late January 1972, the promotion switched its Atlanta television outlet from its longtime home, WQXI- TV (now WXIA-TV) to WTCG. In 1976, WTCG, so renamed WTBS, began retransmitting via satellite, making the station a superstation available to cable systems across the United States, and Georgia Championship Wrestling became the first NWA promotion to be broadcast nationally. Many of the NWA's regional promoters were unhappy, but promoter Jim Barnett claimed since he was only using Georgia-based wrestlers, that there was no harm. Whether or not Barnett was in fact taking the promotion national is a matter of dispute. Some wrestlers, such as Roddy Piper, say that he was in fact doing so, but prevented by fears of crossing organized crime figures involved with the business. Throughout the 1970s, Georgia Championship Wrestling was one of the most popular programs on WTBS.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.226) The Georgia Championship Wrestling TV series, hosted by Gordon Solie, was taped at the WTBS studios at 1050 Techwood Drive in Atlanta before a small, live in- studio audience, as were most pro wrestling TV shows of that era. The show featured wrestling matches, plus melodramatic monologues and inter-character confrontations—similar to the programming offered by other territories, including the Northeast-based World Wrestling Federation (WWF). =World Championship Wrestling (1982–1992)= In 1982, Georgia Championship Wrestling changed its main programming name to World Championship Wrestling, a name Barnett had previously used when promoting in Australia. Ted Turner had requested the name change in hopes of giving the wrestling programming on the Superstation a less regional scope. Also, by this point, GCW had been running shows in \\"neutral\\" territories like Ohio and Michigan. World Championship Wrestling continued to be taped at the WTBS studios until March 1989, when the taping location was moved to the Center Stage Theater, in Atlanta. Black Saturday (1984–1985) In 1984, WWF owner Vince McMahon, hoping to expand the national reach of his Stamford, Connecticut-based company, bought a majority stake in the Georgia territory, and its WTBS time slot, for $750,000. On July 14 of that year, viewers tuned into World Championship Wrestling expecting to see Gordon Solie and the stars of GCW, only to witness McMahon introducing WWF programming instead, an event now known in professional wrestling lore as Black Saturday. Freddie Miller, an announcer, was the only member of the original Georgia Championship Wrestling on-air cast who did not either quit in protest or get replaced by McMahon. McMahon had underestimated two major factors, however. The first was the difference in tastes between wrestling fans from different regions of the United States. GCW matches featured an emphasis on in-ring action with longer and more athletic matches. The WWF, however, was more soap opera-like in character, with cartoonish characters and storylines, and also tended to feature short squash matches in which one wrestler dominated the other. GCW's core audience thus did not receive the WWF product now shown on WTBS well. Secondly, McMahon had promised Ted Turner that he would produce original programming for the time slot at the WTBS studios in Atlanta. Instead, WWF World Championship Wrestling was mainly used as a recap show, featuring matches which had previously aired on the WWF's main television programs such as WWF Championship Wrestling and WWF All- Star Wrestling, which were originally produced in the Northeast. Eventually, the WWF did have in-studio squash matches on the show on an infrequent basis. During this time, the show was co-hosted by Freddie Miller and Gorilla Monsoon, with Monsoon serving as the play-by-play announcer and Miller serving as the ring announcer. This did not stem the tide of negative viewer reaction to the WWF show, however. Angry viewers deluged WTBS with over a thousand complaints, demanding to know where GCW had gone. Turner, angry both at the declining ratings and at McMahon's reneging on his promise of original programming for the WTBS time slot, made two moves to correct the problem. Firstly, he offered Ole Anderson, who had refused to sell his minority interest in GCW to McMahon and instead formed a successor promotion known as Championship Wrestling from Georgia (CWG), a 7:00 a.m. time slot on Saturday mornings. He then gave Bill Watts, the owner of Mid-South Wrestling, a one- hour time slot on Sundays. These moves upset McMahon, who had assumed that the WWF would be the sole provider of professional wrestling content on WTBS with his purchase of GCW. Turner disagreed, citing McMahon's aforementioned breaking of his promise to provide original WWF programming for the WTBS time slot. Under Jim Crockett Promotions (1985–1988) World Championship Wrestling logo, as seen from the opening sequence used from 1982 to 1987. The decline in ratings for the WWF's Saturday evening show, and the fans clamoring for GCW, began to make the WWF's foray onto WTBS one that lost the federation money. Eventually, McMahon cut his losses and sold the former GCW time slot to Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) for $1 million in March 1985.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcwsaturdaynight85.htm The final WWF produced edition of World Championship Wrestling aired on March 25, 1985. JCP, based in Charlotte, North Carolina and run by Jim Crockett, Jr., was, like CWG and Mid-South, a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and ran NWA- branded shows in Virginia and the Carolinas. Crockett's first order of business was to merge his promotion with CWG, thus allowing his wrestlers to compete on CWG's Saturday morning WTBS time slot and vice versa. This deal (which former Georgia Championship Wrestling promoter Jim Barnett helped broker), however, forced the elimination of the Mid-South Wrestling program, which had been the highest-rated program on WTBS, from the WTBS schedule. Bill Watts had been poised to take over the former GCW time slot from McMahon, but instead ended up selling his promotion (by now known as the Universal Wrestling Federation) to Crockett in 1987. JCP retained the World Championship Wrestling name. Crockett filled the time slot with two hours of original programming filmed in Turner's Atlanta studios. The program name would also become the promotion's name following the purchase of JCP by Turner Broadcasting in 1988. In addition, the Saturday morning Championship Wrestling from Georgia program would become Championship Wrestling and use the same set as the Crockett-era World Championship Wrestling Saturday evening program. =Superstars in Supertowns (February 7, 1987)= The February 7, 1987, edition of NWA World Championship Wrestling was a special called Superstars in Supertowns.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcwsaturdaynight87.htm It promoted the return of Magnum T.A. (who was forced to retire due to a near fatal car accident in October 1986http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcwsaturdaynight86.htm) and opened up with a first-person view of a car driving on the road. Tony Schiavone and David Crockett, dressed in tuxedos, hosted the show which showed different matches from cities like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Los Angeles, and St. Louis. The opening contest was Barry Windham vs. Arn Anderson from the Philadelphia Civic Center. =November 5, 1988= The November 5, 1988, edition of NWA World Championship Wrestling began with \\"Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair cutting a promo and pointing out a large group of Turner executives in the crowd.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcwsaturdaynight88.htm This was a subtle nod to Turner Broadcasting purchasing the assets of Jim Crockett Promotions. This program launched the WCW brand under the banner of the National Wrestling Alliance, initially designed as a mutually beneficial arrangement, but ultimately one that proved divisive. On this first program, the Jim Cornette–Paul E. Dangerously feud took center stage as their dueling versions of the well-known tag team Midnight Express commenced an intense feud that would last until the following February.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcwsaturdaynight89.htm =WCW Saturday Night (1992–2000)= World Championship Wrestling would be renamed WCW Saturday Night on April 4, 1992.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcwsaturdaynight92.htm This reflected an overhauled look and a new home studio-arena at the Center Stage Theater in Atlanta with some footage from matches in Columbus, Georgia. The show was presented in a \\"neon\\" style, with a blue and pink color scheme. Neon signs displayed the show's logo, and the wrestlers entered through a silver mylar curtain. The show was given a new look again in March 1994,http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcwsaturdaynight94.htm with a futuristic design with a unique entry way of slide-open doors and billowing smoke as the performers made their way to the ring. When the show originally premiered, it was hosted by Jim Ross and Jesse Ventura. Bruno Sammartino also appeared sporadically as a guest color commentator during certain weeks in 1992. Tony Schiavone took over the hosting duties following Ross' departure for the WWF in 1993 and remained until 1998. Bobby Heenan would replace Ventura after joining WCW in the beginning of 1994. Dusty Rhodes, who affectionately referred to Saturday Night as \\"The Mothership\\", replaced him in 1995 and continued until January 1998. Rhodes and Schiavone were removed from the broadcast so Schiavone could focus on his other broadcasting duties and Rhodes could take a managerial role after having turned heel, joining the New World Order. They were replaced by Scott Hudson and Mike Tenay, who was later replaced with Larry Zbyszko. Gene Okerlund often handled interviews after he joined WCW in 1993, as did Tenay, Schiavone, and Lee Marshall. In the summer of 1996, WCW Saturday Night was taped at WCW Pro's Disney–MGM Studios set in Orlando, Florida due to all of Turner's mobile production units being used by other broadcasters for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Live episodes Episodes of WCW Saturday Night were usually filmed well in advance, with the exception of three live editions. The first one aired on July 9, 1994. Sting wrestled Ric Flair as voted on by fans. Hulk Hogan made his first in-studio appearance, and he and Sting were attacked by Sherri Martel. The second aired from downtown Charlotte, North Carolina, on May 27, 1995.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcwsaturdaynight95.htm It started raining halfway through the outdoor show, causing the ring mat to become slippery at times. The third live airing, again outdoors, took place on August 10, 1996,http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcwsaturdaynight96.htm from the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis, South Dakota. The show took place right before the Hog Wild pay-per-view event, which was held on a Saturday night instead of the usual Sunday night slot for WCW pay-per-views. Hence, WCW Saturday Night was used as a lead-in to the pay-per-view show, much like WCW Main Event was used as a lead-in for Sunday pay-per-views until 1996. Decline and end (1998–2000) When WCW introduced the live program Monday Nitro on TNT in September 1995, the pre-taped Saturday Night became secondary in importance. When Thunder premiered in January 1998, Saturday Night became WCW's third-tier program. The majority of airtime would be used to display up-and-comers and recent graduates of the WCW Power Plant (with the occasional squash match) as well recapping the major events of the other shows. The main event would often feature mid-card performers such as the current Cruiserweight Champion, Television Champion, or U.S. Heavyweight Champion in a non-title match.

Life The son of an old-established Transylvanian Saxon family, Friedrich von Bömches was born in Braşov at a time when Transylvania was still part of Austria-Hungary. In 1938, he was drafted in the Romanian Army, and marched with it up to Stalingrad. Von Bömches was demobbed in 1945, but as a German he was deported to the Soviet Union by occupying forces shortly after, and was forced to work in Ukrainian quarries until 1950. In 1974 von Bömches relocated to the Federal Republic of Germany and four years later finally found - with the assistance of a local factory owner - a new home at Wiehl, a small town in North Rhine-Westphalia. Here, the artist lives together with his wife Erna (married since 1945) and still responds to his unbowed creative urge, though evidently limited by a severe heart surgery performed in 2001. Work Friedrich von Bömches has been highly successful in sublimating his bitter experiences with war and captivity. He took up this artistic transformation using the medium of photography: during the Stalingrad campaign von Bömches created a lot of photographs (most of which have additional documentary value). Not allowed to engage in this art throughout his captivity, von Bömches compensated by resorting to drawing. To date, von Bömches has produced again and again his famous Sekundenskizzen (\\"instant sketches\\") - he admitted to be suffering from a \\"hysterical pencil addiction\\". Nonetheless, a large portion of his post-release works deal with the tragedy of human existence, death (including his heralds that age and decay), hunger und persecution - to some extent in biblical or mythological moods. In \\"trapping\\" the living through the contemplation of such seeming opposites as Life and Death, he provides equal motifs: masterly portraits thanks to an outstanding power of observation, as well as many \\"little\\" pictures, most of them extempore, with animal and other themes. The German connoisseur and patron of arts Peter Ludwig (1925–1996) referred to von Bömches as the \\"probably greatest portraitist of the present\\". Between 1950 and 1974, he created some fifteen thousand works. None of them were taken out of Romania. The number of his creations in Germany probably reaches a similar number, including his portraits of notable persons (more than five hundred in number). =Paintings and drawings (selection of the late work)= * Tell Me where the Flowers Are (Sag mir, wo die Blumen sind), acrylic, 1990 * The Ferryman (Der Fährmann), mid-1990s * The Embarrassing Guest (Der unangenehme Gast), mid-1990s * Terminus (Endstation), mid-1990s * There Is No Way Back (Es gibt kein Zurück), mid-1990s * The Endless Way (Der unendliche Weg), mid-1990s * Pietà, mid-1990s * Crucifixion (Kreuzigung), mid-1990s * Funeral Cortege in Romania (Trauerzug in Rumänien), mid-1990s * People Left Behind (Die Zurückgelassenen), charcoal, 1994 * Nursing Home (Altenheim), 1995 * Behind Barbwire (Hinter Stacheldraht), mixed media, 1999 * Trip in the Dark (Fahrt ins Ungewisse) (Trilogy: Day / Night / The Door Opens), mixed media, 2001 =Notabilities' portraits (selection)= * Berthold Beitz, chairman of the supervisory board at Krupp * Hans-Dietrich Genscher * Martin Heidegger * Philipp Jenninger, speaker of the Federal Diet of Germany (1984–88) * Lore Lorentz (1920–1994), Grande Dame of German cabaret * Peter Ludwig (1925–1996), German connoisseur and patron of arts * Hermann Oberth * Herbert Quandt * Horst Waffenschmidt (1933–2002), German politician Exhibitions in Germany (selection) * 1966 / 1974: Aachen, Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum * 1985: Bonn - Bad Godesberg (Muffendorf), Altes Kelterhaus * 1998: Burzenland - Artist's Land, Dinkelsbühl, parish house St. Paul * 2001: Hommage à Friedrich von Bömches, Wiehl, lobby of savings bank * 2002: The Way to Stalingrad (photographies), Berlin, Romanian Institute of Culture / Banishment, Nümbrecht, Homburg castle * 2005: Pictures from the Gulag, Ulm, Donauschwäbisches Zentralmuseum / Lost Years, Stolberg-Vicht, Europäischer Kunsthof * 2007: Gundelsheim, Baden-Württemberg, Transylvanian Museum at Horneck Castle * Durable exhibition at Gummersbach, Kreishaus Tributes Friedrich von Bömches received several awards for his life's work: * In Romania (Merit Cultural) * In Ohio, United States * In Germany (1987: Federal Cross of Merit, 2002: Schwarzenberger Hochzeitstaler in Gold ) Literature * Friedrich von Bömches: Malerei und Grafik, 1992, * Friedrich von Bömches: Leben und Schicksal, 1996, * Veröffentlichungen des Südostdeutschen Kulturwerks: Reihe A, Kultur und Dichtung; Bd. 52, 1997, See also * List of German painters References Category:1916 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from Brașov Category:Transylvanian-Saxon people Category:German people of German-Romanian descent Category:Expressionism Category:20th-century German painters Category:German male painters Category:21st-century German painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:Romanian painters Category:Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Friedrich von Bömches"},{"id":"3387518","text":"Ashford Borough Council in Kent, England is elected every four years.

Kujawiak was built by Vickers-Armstrongs at the company's High Walker yard on the River Tyne. Her keel was laid down on 22 November 1939 and she was launched on 30 October 1940 as HMS Oakley but on completion in June 1941 she was renamed and commissioned into the Polish Navy. Kujawiak was sunk on 16 June 1942 after running into a German MT 14 minefield near Malta while participating in Operation Harpoon. 13 Polish sailors died and 20 were wounded. Design The ship was ordered under the 1939 War Emergency Programme as HMS Oakley on 4 September 1939 from Vickers-Armstrongs High Walker Yard on the Tyne who laid her down on 22 November 1939 with the yard number of J4145. Her engines were to be constructed by Parsons. She was launched on 30 October 1940 under her British name but on 3 April 1941 it was decided to transfer her together with to the Polish Navy. On her completion on 17 June 1941 she was commissioned as ORP Kujawiak. War service =1941= On 18 June Kujawiak came under attack by German aircraft whilst on passage from Tyne to Scapa Flow to work-up for operational service with ships of Home Fleet. Fire from the aircraft hit the 4-inch ready-use ammunition which exploded causing one fatal casualty. After completing her work-up on 25 July she joined the 15th Destroyer Flotilla based at Plymouth for local convoy escort and patrol duties. Later that year on 23 October Kujawiak deployed with fellow Polish destroyer for escort of inward Convoy SL89 during final stage of passage in Irish Sea from Freetown into Liverpool. On 22 December she sailed from Scapa Flow as part of Force J to carry out landings on the Lofoten Islands as part of Operation Claymore. Two days later on 27 December the destroyer sustained slight damage from a near miss during air attacks. =1942= In early June 1942 Kujawiak was nominated for loan service with the Home Fleet as part of the escort for the planned relief convoy to Malta (Operation Harpoon). On 6 June she joined military Convoy WS19S in the Northwest Approaches as part of Ocean Escort for passage to Gibraltar. She joined Force X at Gibraltar on 12 June whose task was to escort the Harpoon convoy through the Sicilian Narrows to Malta. On 14 June the convoy came under heavy and sustained air attacks during which the cruiser was damaged. The following day the air attacks continued and Kujawiak was in action with Italian warships attempting to intercept and attack the convoy. Near midnight on 16 June, while entering Grand Harbor, Malta Kujawiak sustained major structural damage forward after detonating a mine while going to the aid of after she had struck a mine. Kujawiak sank before a successful tow could be achieved. =Discovery of wreck= On 22 September 2014 a Polish expedition discovered the location of the wreck of Kujawiak.

It is located at the end of a half-mile drive, off the main A31 road. Pax Hill is a red-bricked house fronting south with higher ground behind. In the Baden-Powell family's time, there was a rose garden with dovecote at one side of the front of the house. Elsewhere, there were two summer houses, a shrubbery and a tennis court. Scouts and Guides camped on either side of the drive. The Baden-Powells added two wings. The west wing was designed by Robert Baden-Powell himself and he also modelled the frieze for the new bathroom, depicting fish in the River Wey. The house was originally called \\"Blackacre\\" and was purchased with a gift from Olave Baden-Powell's father in 1918. In 1929, it was burgled and a number of souvenirs were stolen. They moved to Kenya in 1939 and Robert Baden-Powell died in 1941. The following year, due to World War II, Pax Hill was occupied by Canadian military troops and by way of recompense, Olave Baden-Powell was awarded a 'grace and favour' apartment in Hampton Court Palace. After World War II, Olave Baden-Powell gave Pax Hill to the Girl Guides Association (now Girlguiding UK) to be used as a centre for members from the Commonwealth of Nations. The house became a Domestic Science Training School run on Guiding principles. The interest from £40,000 in the B.P. Memorial Fund was used to fund its upkeep. In April 1953, Pax Hill was sold with the consent of Olave Baden-Powell. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Pax Hill was a boys boarding school. It has been a nursing home since 1988.

Written by Chuck Dixon with art by Rodolfo Damaggio and Robert Campanella, it features Mr. Freeze and a Catwoman cameo.Batman Vs Predator - Universe-Shattering Comic Book Crossovers - UGO.com Summary = Batman Versus Predator = The first book opens with a boxing match in Gotham City. Each of the fighters are backed by two of the city's biggest gangsters--Alex Yeager and Leo Brodin. When the winner of the fight is killed in his apartment shortly after the bout, Batman is called in to help investigate the crime. Though accusations are directed against Brodin, the sponsor of the losing fighter, the grisly yet unusual murder (consisting of spine and skull removal) suggests otherwise. Batman's main goal initially is to avoid a battle on the streets of Gotham between the two mob bosses--the death of the losing boxer only making matters more complicated. In an attempt to defuse the conflict, Yeager's partner, a \\"legitimate\\" but corrupt businessman, arranges a meeting between the two crime lords during which Yeager is murdered by an invisible intruder. Clues lead Batman to the killer's hideout in an abandoned scrapyard, but in a deadly duel, he comes close to losing his life to the Predator, who escapes. Batman retreats to Wayne Manor, where his butler Alfred Pennyworth treats his injuries. Bedridden and encased in an orthopedic cast, he begins the slow process of recovery and to plan for another match with the Predator. Over the next few days, and in the absence of the Dark Knight, the Predator also targets Yeager's partner, Brodin, and Gotham's current mayor in a series of calculated assaults. Commissioner James Gordon himself is almost killed in his own home by the hunter, but escapes thanks to the sacrifice of another officer. Batman attempts to recover quickly, knowing the death toll rises every day. A countdown is initiated by the National Guard and SWAT teams: if Batman does not emerge before the end of the countdown, they plan to flush the Predator out of hiding by searching street-by-street, a tactic that will likely take more lives than would be saved. Batman, nowhere near healed yet able to walk, uses a custom-designed powered sonar exoskeleton suit to increase his strength, compensate for his recovering blindness, and counter the Predator's stealth technology. The battle begins on the roof of the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD), continues in the Batcave after a chase on the Batmobile, and ends on the outskirts of Wayne Manor. After the Predator sustains several injuries, including being hit with a wide-spectrum tranquilizer by Batman and shot with an old blunderbuss by Alfred, Batman finally knocks it down with a wooden baseball bat as its ship lands; others of its kind disembark. The defeated Predator commits honor suicide with a sword, which the Predator commander presents to Batman before leaving. Batman is confident that the Predators will not return after having met Gotham's inhabitants. = Batman Versus Predator II: Bloodmatch = The story opens after Batman--unwillingly aided by Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)--successfully apprehends a criminal during a drug-related homicide. The criminal reveals that his boss, a drug lord named Terraro, has put a price on Batman's head and hired seven of the world's professional assassins to hunt him. Shortly after the capture, a strange, luminous object (reported to be a meteorite) lands beyond the Gotham River. At the same time, Gotham City experiences a severe heat wave. The creature kills one of the assassins on a rooftop, knocks out Huntress (but spares her, having mistaken her for Batman), kills several of Terraro's associates, and attacks the GCPD before retreating with the Bat- Signal. Batman investigates the murder scene, determining it to be another Predator attack, before following the signal's direction beyond the city limits. He is ambushed by the creature, only to be saved by the timely arrival of the Huntress. Another one of Terraro's assassins is eliminated by the Predator when he tries to steal the kill during the fight. Now informed of the creature's identity, the Huntress follows leads on Terraro, avoiding two of his assassins that kill each other accidentally. She also seeks to defeat the Predator as a challenge, despite knowing that she will become a target herself. Instead of donning his exoskeleton, Batman develops a gauntlet to generate an electromagnetic pulse which can nullify the creature’s stealth technology. The FBI arrive, revealing plans to set up a specialized strike force to kill the creature quickly. Batman and the Huntress both confront Terraro, but all are attacked by the Predator, and Terraro is murdered in his own loft. Another of Terraro's assassins is apprehended afterward. Batman tracks the alien, only to discover the corpse of a different Predator. When another alien retrieves his fallen comrade in plain sight of him, Batman deduces that these two are not tracking him, but rather the Predator rampaging through Gotham, who seems to have no qualms in killing members of its own species. After disabling one of the two of Terraro's remaining assassins, Batman regroups with Commissioner Gordon, now aided by the FBI. They plan to use the Bat-Signal to lure the creature into the open, where they can assault it. The attempt fails: both federal agents are killed, a non-threatening Predator is mistaken for the real killer and is injured, and team member Lieutenant Stocker is captured by the true killer and taken hostage. Batman and the Huntress track it back to the ship, followed by the last of Terraro's assassins, who is also murdered by the beast. It overpowers the both of them, but Lt. Stocker sacrifices his life, impaling the Predator with its own spear, though the creature lives long enough to activate the ship's engines. As Batman and the Huntress escape the fleeing vessel, another ship appears and follows, opening fire on the vessel and destroying both ships. The book ends with the Bat-Signal lighting up again, signaling trouble from The Joker; a relative relief to the other-worldly troubles. = Batman Versus Predator III: Blood Ties = Gotham City, suffering yet again from sweltering temperatures and increased gang warfare, experiences more mysterious deaths. Aided now by his protégé, Robin (Tim Drake), Batman worries that this may be yet another series of hunts by the brutal Predator aliens, yet refuses to disclose this to his partner, irking Robin. Indeed, not one, but two beasts are prowling in Gotham: an elder creature who seems to tell stories of previous hunts to his younger partner. Gotham's criminal population remains unaware of the alien visitors, until Mr. Freeze and his associates are attacked by the two cloaked Predators. Though all of his nearby henchmen are killed, Mr. Freeze is left alive, as his lowered body temperature makes him invisible to the Predators' infrared vision. Despite Robin's questions about the bizarre attacks, Batman does not reveal anything more than what Robin has already overheard, though he agrees to let Robin aid him until Mr. Freeze is found. Batman later confides to Alfred that his reticence with Robin is out of a desire to keep the boy from becoming a target of the Predators. Batman attacks one of the aliens with an advanced helicopter prototype from Wayne Technologies, inadvertently saving Catwoman's life in the process. He also discovers the second Predator, safely ejecting from his helicopter as the vehicle is destroyed in the process. Meanwhile, at the advice of Oracle (Barbara Gordon), Robin learns details of previous \\"hunts\\" through computer research in confidential government files. He also successfully tracks down Mr. Freeze and subdues him. When questioned, Mr. Freeze reveals the creatures did not seem to have even seen him. With Mr. Freeze now in custody, Batman orders Robin to lie low, further aggravating the youth. In an effort to defeat the beasts, Bruce manipulates WayneTech into closing down for 24 hours to provide a battleground he can control. He modifies the powered exoskeleton he used in his first encounter to mask his body temperature, to exploit the Predators' thermal-based vision, and suspects that they are cold-blooded and vulnerable to frigid temperature. The plan works, but only lures one of the two aliens. Responding to Batman's confusion, and using Tim Drake's voice, the Predator indicates that it is now tracking Robin at a drive-in theater with friends, where he is watching old science- fiction films. Batman then ensnares the elder Predator with Mr. Freeze's absolute zero cannon. Alfred contacts Robin, who immediately accepts the truth and returns to the Batcave when he sees the creature's silhouette. The butler explains what little they know of their assailants before they are attacked. The two are nearly caught, but Batman returns, carrying one of the elder Predator's ornaments and telling the younger hunter to cut his losses, take his defeated but living father, and return home. When questioned, Batman reveals that he and Robin were targeted because the Predators saw them as they themselves were: father and son warriors.

Biography He started from humble beginnings, most probably as an abandoned child, and the surname Davila was bestowed on him by his adoptive family and guardian. Davila studied medicine at the University of Paris, graduating in February 1853. In March 1853, he arrived in Romania. He was the organizer of the military medical service for the Romanian Army and of the country's public health system. Davila, together with Nicolae Kretzulescu, inaugurated medical training in Romania in 1857, by founding the National School of Medicine and Pharmacy. It was he who had determined government authorities to issue the first official instructions concerning the health care of factory workers and the organisation of medical districts in the country. It was due to his many activities that several scientific associations appeared in Romania: the Medical Society (1857), the Red Cross Society (1876), the Natural Sciences Society (1876). With his assistance, two medical journals entered print: the Medical Register (1862) and the Medical Gazette (1865). During the Independence War (1877-1878) he was the head of the Army's sanitary service. Davila is also credited with the invention of the Davila tincture for the treatment of cholera, an opioid-based oral solution in use for symptomatic management of diarrhea. Today, the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest, the largest of its kind in Romania, is named in his honor. Statue of Carol Davila by Karl Storck, in front of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest On 14 January 1874, his wife, Ana Racoviţă, a descendant of the Racoviţă and Golescu boyar families, was accidentally poisoned when a colleague of Davila's gave her strychnine instead of quinine. Davila's son Alexandru was a noted dramatist and friend of King Carol I. Works * Syphilis Prophylaxis (1853) * Athmospheric Air (1871).

Gold rush The Turon River is well renowned because it was the site of one of Australia's first alluvial gold rushes. During the gold rush Chinese migrant workers built a water race to bring water to mining operations along sections of the Turon River. Many parts of the race can still be seen today, such as at Turon Gates. The Turon River was the site of violence between miners and licensing authorities during the gold rush.

Cantacuzino (, also Ion Cantacuzino; 25 November 1863 – 14 January 1934) was a renowned Romanian physician and bacteriologist, a professor at the Romanian School of Medicine and Pharmacy and a member of the Romanian Academy. He established the fields of microbiology and experimental medicine in Romania, and founded the Ioan Cantacuzino Institute. Early days Born in Bucharest as a member of the Cantacuzino family, he graduated from the University of Paris' Faculty of Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, and worked at several hospitals in Paris, obtaining his doctorate in 1894. Later in the same year, he began his academic career as a deputy professor at the University of Iaşi, and returned to Paris after two years to serve on the staff of the Pasteur Institute, where he worked under the direction of Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov. Career In 1901, Cantacuzino was assigned a teaching position in Bucharest, where he became a major influence on a generation of scientists. His discoveries were relevant in the treatment of cholera, epidemic typhus, tuberculosis, and scarlet fever. As a disciple of Mechnikov, he devoted part of his research to expanding on the latter's field of interest (phagocytes, the body's means of defence against pathogens, as well as the issue of immunity and invertebrates). He invented the notion of contact immunity. During the Second Balkan War, Cantacuzino was appointed head of the staff combatting the cholera epidemic in the ranks of the Romanian Army stationed in Dobruja; he was assigned to the same position during the Romanian campaign in World War I, in the fight against typhus. He founded and led the scientific magazines Revista Ştiinţelor Medicale and Archives roumaines de pathologie expérimentale, and regularly contributed to the literary magazine Viața Românească (replacing Paul Bujor on the editorial board).Constantin Stere, \\"Cum am devenit director al Vieţii Romîneşti [sic]\\" (\\"How I Became an Editor of Viața Românească\\"), in Viaţa Românească, 1&2/XXV, January–February 1933. p. 13 A collaborator of Constantin Stere, he was noted as a Poporanist disciple of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea.

The strike involved three of the province's four major copper mines: those in Mufulira, Nkana and Roan Antelope. Near the latter, six protesters were killed by police and the strike ended. Although it failed, the strike was the first organized industrial agitation in Northern Rhodesia and is viewed by some as the first overt action against colonial rule. It caught the attention of a number of African townsmen, leading to the creation of trade unions and African nationalist politics, and is seen as the birth of African nationalism. The strike and others in Africa during the period dramatically changed the British government's urban and migration policies. The unrest gave missionaries a chance to respond to the \\"Watchtower movement\\", joining the mining companies to provide a Christian education and create a disciplined workforce. The colonial administration, foreseeing a future drop in copper prices, also created social-service schemes for rural relatives of the urban workers. Background =Colonialism in Northern Rhodesia= Location of Northern Rhodesia in Africa The Copperbelt was a region of Northern Rhodesia known for its rich copper ore deposits. Cecil John Rhodes, a British capitalist and empire builder, was the leading light of British expansion north of the Limpopo River into south-central Africa. In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and how to improve river navigation in the region; during this trek, Burnham discovered large copper deposits along the Kafue River. Rhodes brought British influence into the region by obtaining mineral rights from local chiefs through questionable treaties. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 by the United Kingdom and Portugal, fixed the boundary between territories administered by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) in North- Eastern Rhodesia and Portuguese Mozambique. It also fixed the boundary between the BSAC-administered territory of North-Western Rhodesia (now in Zambia) and Portuguese Angola, although the boundary with Angola was not marked on the ground until later. The northern border of the British territory in North- Eastern Rhodesia and the British Central Africa Protectorate was agreed in an 1890 Anglo-German treaty which also fixed the (very short) boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and German South-West Africa, now Namibia. The boundary between the Congo Free State and British territory was fixed by an 1894 treaty, although minor adjustments were made until the 1930s. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and North-Eastern Rhodesia was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River, and the boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia became the Zambezi River in 1898. Northern Rhodesia was under BSAC control until 1924, when it became part of the British Empire. =Mining= The discovery of large deposits of copper sulfide during the 1900s encouraged large mining companies to invest in Northern Rhodesia. South African interest in the region was led by the Anglo American Corporation, which gained an interest in the Bwana Mkubwa Company in 1924 and acquired a one-third interest in Mufulira in 1928. That year, Anglo American acquired control of the Nkana mine at Kitwe and formed Rhodesian Anglo American; shareholders included the United States, South African finance houses and the British South Africa Company. As the BSAC purchased shares in Rhodesian Anglo American, the latter became a major shareholder in BSAC. By 1930, Chester Beatty's Rhodesian Selection Trust and Ernest Oppenheimer's Anglo-American Corporation controlled most of the region's mining. The Roan Antelope and Nkana mines began commercial production in 1931. 1935 strike =Development= The emergence of mining increased the migration of native African people in search of employment to the province from elsewhere in Africa. The mining industry improved the standard of living of those living along Northern Rhodesia's railroads, and increased the influx of white people, the Europeans from South Africa who wanted to maintain their superiority over the native African population. Native Africans were poorly treated by the whites and discouraged from working in the mines; this evolved into a racial struggle. The high rate of immigration to the region increased the number of unplanned settlements. The BSAC introduced a hut tax in 1901 in North-Eastern Rhodesia and between 1904 and 1913 in North-Western Rhodesia for all migrants. The tax was high (in some cases, six months' wages), and intended to create a system of debt bondage and generate income for investment in other mines. Unrest caused by tax increases was suppressed with the help of the British South Africa Police.Mukwena 2016, pp. 128–9 The imposition of tax was a strategy adopted to create bond labour and sustain demand during the 1920s when the demand for miners was higher. The company was able to maintain low wages on account of predominance of migrant labour from rural regions. The African miners had three major issues: low wages compared to European miners, a prohibition against working in mines reserved for Europeans despite high skills, and workplace harassment and brutality. The Great Depression (1929–35) led to a fall in European copper prices which severely damaged the economy of the Copperbelt. In February 1931 the Mkubwa mine was shut down, followed over the next few months by the Chamishi, Nchanga and Mulfira mines. Construction work at the Roan Antelope and Nkana mines was nearing completion at this time, leading to large-scale unemployment; the mines employed 31,941 people in 1930, and 6,677 by the end of 1932. Many unemployed African workers remained, instead of returning to their rural homes. During the period between 1931 and 1932, the European population in the region reduced by 25 per cent. In 1935, the Northern Rhodesian administration doubled urban taxes and reduced them in rural areas to counter the depression and related losses incurred by the closure of one of the region's four mines. The provincial commissioner implemented the tax in May (retroactive to 1 January) after the signing of the Native Tax Amendment Ordinance, and was aware of the latter. =Strike= The strike involved three of the province's four major copper mines: the mines at Mufulira, Nkana and Roan Antelope. On the morning of 21 May 1935, police at Mulfulira announced that taxes were raised from 12 to 15 shillings a year. The strike was spontaneous, with morning-shift miners refusing to go underground. It was led by three Zambians from the Northern Province: William Sankata, Ngostino Mwamba and James Mutali at the Mufulira mine. The other African miners refused to report to work, shouted slogans against the authorities and threw stones at them and non-supportive Africans. At the other two mines, the strike was less spontaneous than at Mufulira (where the tax increase was received with disbelief) and police arrested leaders as a precautionary measure. News of the Mufulira strike spread to the other two mines with the inflow of miners from Mufulira. Beni dancers, who developed the dance form during the colonial era and who mimicked military and colonial administration with music and aesthetic expression, were instrumental in structured communication during the strike. African workers went on strike in Nkana on 27 May, but it failed and ended the following day due to poor leadership. The strike at Roan Antelope, where some tribal leaders participated, turned violent. On 29 May, a large crowd gathered around the compound containing police, officials, clerks and elders; protesters began throwing stones and shouting slogans. The police panicked and fired, leading to the deaths of six protesters and injuring 17 others. Shocked at the shootout, the strikers called off the strike. According to a UNESCO International Scientific Committee report, organized demonstrations were held on 22 May at the Mulfra mine and spread to Nkana on 26 May and the Luansha mines on 28 May. Casualties were reported as 28 killed or injured, with an unspecified number of arrests. Aftermath =Investigation= Immediately after the strike, a commission headed by Russell was appointed by the British colonial administration to investigate its causes. The commission reported that industrialization and de- tribalization were the most important problems in Northern Rhodesia, and the tax's abrupt implementation led to the strike. The report disregarded the role of Beni, but acknowledged that the dancers were primarily involved in recreation and welfare activities. It described two systems of authority: \\"The choice lies between the establishment of native authority, together with frequent repatriation of natives to their villages; or alternatively, the acceptance of definite de-tribalization and industrialization of the mining under European urban control\\". After the enquiry, Hubert Winthrop Young, governor of Northern Rhodesia from 1935 to 1938, established a tribal leaders' advisory council for Africans in the Copperbelt similar to the one at the Roan Antelope mine. Some historians considered it the conventional indirect rule imposed after similar incidents to avoid future uprisings. =Reform= alt=Two miners digging in close quarters After 1935, the mines were reopened and there was steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries a chance to respond to the Watchtower movement in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).Gordon 2012, p. 82 Most of the mining companies felt that the expected recovery would result in a labor shortage and challenge economic recovery. The government believed that if copper prices fell in the future, similar effects would be experienced. The colonial administration implemented two schemes to maintain the relationship of urban workers with their rural homelands. Health-service expenditures by rural relatives of urban workers were borne by the government, and the rural male migration of the working population was reduced. Significance Historians believe that the strike, and other strikes in Africa during the period, changed the urban and migration policies of the British government in Africa. Governor Hubert Young, after a long struggle, obtained research funding of labour migration in Africa. Historian Godfrey Wilson studied urban African labour from 1939 to 1940, but his work was halted. Although the strike achieved little at the time, it is seen a key moment in the emergence of African nationalism in Zambia. African townsmen discovered their identity, leading to trade unionism and the gradual emergence of anti-colonial politics. The actions by British authorities led to five years of prosperity for the mining companies; European miners struck for higher pay and were rewarded. In 1940, there were several mine strikes in the province which lasted over a week; 17 workers were killed and 65 injured. Footnotes * The Watchtower (locally called Kitawala) was a millenarian religious movement, led by literate Africans, which derived its ideologies from North American religious movements. There were as many as five Watchtower movements, but the one led by Joseph Sibakwe during the 1930s was the most prominent.Gordon 2012, p. 72 In general, adherents opposed colonial rule. By 1936, the movement was affiliated to Jehovah's Witnesses. As per the account of Tordoff (1974), the movement was one of the earliest drivers of independence movement in the country and they opposed political authority even after independence during the rule of United National Independence Party (UNIP) in 1963.Mukwena 2016, pp. 14–5 Notes References * * Category:1935 labor disputes and strikes Category:1935 in Northern Rhodesia Category:Miners' labor disputes Category:Copperbelt Province Category:Copper mines in Zambia Category:Labour in Zambia Category:Northern Rhodesia Category:May 1935 events ","title":"1935 Copperbelt strike"},{"id":"3387643","title":"Bracknell Town F.C."},{"id":"3387648","text":"Mr. Calder and Mr. Behrens are fictional counter-intelligence agents created by the British mystery and thriller writer Michael Gilbert. The characters appear in 24 short stories, most of which first appeared in either the British magazine Argosy or the American Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. The stories were collected in two anthologies, Game without Rules (1967) and Mr. Calder & Mr. Behrens (1982). One story, \\"Double, Double\\", was later republished in an Ellery Queen paperback. Many involve finding and dealing with British traitors or deeply embedded foreign agents; a few take place in Europe; one particularly grim one is set in World War II, during which Mr. Behrens is the bomb-maker in a failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. The characters also appeared in 16 BBC radio plays, largely based on the short stories. Gilbert, who was appointed CBE in 1980, was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers' Association. The Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master in 1988 and in 1990 he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award. Biographical Information Gilbert's two agents are outwardly gentlemanly and urbane. Beneath their innocuous appearance, however, they are ruthless and exceedingly hard-boiled killers. They are long-time close friends who are unmarried and who live near each other in the vicinity of Lamperdown, Kent. Mr. Behrens lives at The Old Rectory, while Mr. Calder is at The Cottage, Hyde Hill. (Gilbert's own address, at which he lived for many years, and where he died at age 93, was Luddesdown Old Rectory, Cobham, Gravesend, Kent.) Both Calder and Behrens were educated in various parts of Europe before World War II and speak a number of languages: Mr. Behrens is rated A+ for Standard-German and A for Standard-French, Standard Greek, Italian, and Russian. Mr. Calder is rated A for Standard Albanian and Hungarian and B for Standard-Greek, Italian, Arabic, and Russian. Mr. Calder lives with Rasselas, his 128-pound Persian deerhound whom he has adopted from a dead adversary. Like his master, Rasselas is quiet and unassuming, but also a highly trained and deadly killer. He is by Shad Jehan out of Galietta. His color is \\"Golden with darker patches. Eyes Amber. Nose blue-black.\\"All biographical information about Calder, Behrens, and Rasselas comes from three pages of prefatory material in Game without Rules Both Calder and Behrens did classified work during World War II, then in the late 1950s went to work for a Mr. Fortescue at the Joint Services Standing Intelligence Committee (External Branch), more often known as JSSIC(E). In one story, the Prime Minister recalls his predecessor telling him that \\"E\\" Branch takes on the jobs \\"so disreputable\\" that no other agency will handle them.Game without Rules, by Michael Gilbert, Harper & Row, New York, in the story \\"The Spoilers\\", page 61 The cover of Mr. Fortescue is that of bank manager at the Westminster branch of the London and Home Counties Bank. As one adversary refers to them bitterly just before dying, both Calder and Behrens are \\"middle-aged cut-throats\\"; by the time the stories end, however, they have grown old but not noticeably softer or less capable. Rasselas, however, in \\"A Prince of Abyssina\\", is killed by a German war criminal intent on killing Mr. Calder. After rescuing his friend, Mr. Behrens then helps Mr. Calder dig a :\\"deep grave behind the woodpile, [they] laid the dog in it and filled it in, and patted the earth into a mound. It was a fine resting place, looking southward over the feathery tops of the trees, across the Weald of Kent.

At the time of its cancellation, WorldWide was the longest-running, uninterrupted weekly syndicated show of any kind on the air in the United States. History =Wide World Wrestling= The show began in 1975 (as Wide World Wrestling), a syndicated one-hour program produced by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Jim Crockett Promotions. It was taped each Wednesday night at WRAL-TV television studios in Raleigh, North Carolina, following the taping of the syndicated Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. The original host of Wide World Wrestling was former Georgia Championship Wrestling announcer Ed Capral. Later hosts of Wide World Wrestling included George Scott, Sandy Scott, Dr. Tom Miller and Les Thatcher. =NWA World Wide Wrestling= In 1978, to avoid confusion with ABC's Wide World of Sports (many newspapers would incorrectly mix the two shows up in their listings), JCP changed the name of the show to World Wide Wrestling. Rich Landrum became the new host and was joined shortly thereafter by veteran wrestler Johnny Weaver as color commentator. In the summer of 1981, WRAL television opted not to renew its contract with JCP, citing that it needed the studio space to produce a new local version of PM Magazine. Crockett initially worked out a deal with WCCB television in Charlotte to house the tapings, but that fell through. So he instead went with WPCQ-TV (now WCNC-TV) in Charlotte (where Ted Turner once held a telethon to save the channel from going bankrupt). WPCQ had briefly played host to tapings for Eddie Einhorn's International Wrestling Association in the 1970s, so it seemed like a natural fit. The physical studio itself was very cramped however; the ring, television sets, banners, and camera platforms, which had been positioned symmetrically at WRAL, were now positioned off-center. Landrum left World Wide Wrestling in 1982 after being released by Jim Crockett Promotions in a cost-cutting measure. David Crockett left his position as Bob Caudle's color commentator on Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling to take over play-by- play duties on World Wide. For a time, World Wide ran with a three-man announce team as wrestler Ray \\"The Crippler\\" Stevens joined. Rowdy Roddy Piper would also occasionally commentate. Not pleased with the studio situation, Crockett began to make plans to rectify matters and by July 1983, had moved his tapings out of WPCQ and into major arenas, buying a mobile TV truck for $1 million and hiring his own crew. In 1984, Tony Schiavone replaced Weaver as color commentator on World Wide (with Weaver moving over to join Caudle on Mid-Atlantic). Schiavone had previously worked for JCP as the announcer for their minor league baseball team the Charlotte O's, and as the host of their market-specific promotional interview segments, which were used to promote events in individual towns. Tully Blanchard for a time joined World Wide as a color commentator as well. After the sale of JCP's wrestling assets to Turner Broadcasting in 1988, World Wide Wrestling went through a revolving series of announcing teams and included at various times such names as Schiavone, Jim Ross, Gordon Solie, Lance Russell, Chris Cruise, Terry Funk, Dutch Mantell, Ole Anderson, Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura, Scott Hudson, Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan and Larry Zbyszko. =WCW WorldWide= Under the Bill Watts regime, the name World Wide Wrestling was changed to WCW WorldWide in 1992. WorldWide was originally made up of matches from television tapings around the country. Beginning in 1993, when Eric Bischoff took over, the show was taped in Orlando, Florida. The initial home for these tapings was Disney/MGM Studios at Walt Disney World, which gave rise to the term \\"Disney Tapings\\". The last set of tapings at Disney occurred in November 1996 and aired in February 1997; afterward, Disney evicted WCW from the studio space it was using and the company moved the set across Orlando to Universal Studios Florida, where a new set was eventually constructed. In 1998, WorldWide became an in-studio recap show like its sister program WCW Pro had, with an exclusive match or two at the end of the show. These matches continued to be taped in Orlando. On January 23, 1999, the WorldWide exclusive matches were moved out of Orlando and began being taped with WCW Saturday Night, which left its base in Atlanta in 1996 and had become a traveling show. Later still, the matches were moved a second time and began to be recorded before WCW Thunder tapings. In November 2000, the show would change formats, seldom having exclusive matches, and instead would mostly show matches from previous WCW pay-per-view events (as well as providing a recap of that week's Monday Nitro and Thunder). WorldWide was cancelled along with Monday Nitro and Thunder the day before the World Wrestling Federation purchased WCW's tape library and intellectual property. At the time of its cancellation, WorldWide was the longest-running, uninterrupted weekly syndicated show of any kind on the air in the United States. The final episode of WorldWide aired on March 31, 2001, making it the last WCW television show aired. Some syndicated stations would air WorldWide very early in the morning on Sunday (12:00 to 1:00 AM, 1:00 to 2:00 AM, etc.), so there are people who consider the last episode's date to be April 1, 2001, the day of WrestleMania X-Seven.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4y56FIDYnY =Title changes= Throughout the years, WorldWide has hosted numerous title changes. *Magnum T.A. defeated Wahoo McDaniel in a steel cage match to win The NWA US Heavyweight Championship (taped March 23, 1985) *The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers) defeated The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) to win the NWA United States Tag Team Championship on May 14, 1988 (taped April 26, 1988) *Eddie Gilbert and Rick Steiner defeated The Varsity Club (Kevin Sullivan and Steve Williams) to win the NWA United States Tag Team Championship on March 18, 1989 (taped February 28, 1989) *Brian Pillman and Tom Zenk defeated The Fabulous Freebirds (Jimmy Garvin and Michael Hayes) in a tournament final to win the reactivated NWA United States Tag Team Championship on February 24, 1990 (taped February 12, 1990) *Arn Anderson defeated Tom Zenk to win the WCW World Television Championship on January 27, 1991 (taped January 7, 1991) *The Fabulous Freebirds (Jimmy Garvin and Michael Hayes) and Badstreet defeated Tommy Rich and Junkyard Dog in a handicap match to win the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship on June 22, 1991 (taped June 3, 1991) *Steve Austin defeated Bobby Eaton to win the WCW World Television Championship on June 29, 1991 (taped June 3, 1991, re-taped June 4, 1991) *Dustin Rhodes, Tom Zenk, and Big Josh defeated The Fabulous Freebirds (Jimmy Garvin and Michael Hayes) and Badstreet to win the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship on August 24, 1991 (taped August 5, 1991) *The York Foundation (Richard Morton, Tommy Rich and Terrance Taylor) defeated Dustin Rhodes, Tom Zenk, and Big Josh to win the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship on November 10, 1991 (taped October 8, 1991) *Steve Austin defeated Barry Windham to win the WCW World Television Championship on June 13, 1992 (taped May 23, 1992) *Scott Steiner defeated Ricky Steamboat to win the WCW World Television Championship on October 17, 1992 (taped September 29, 1992) *The Hollywood Blonds (Steve Austin and Brian Pillman) defeated Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas to win the Unified NWA/WCW World Tag Team Championship on March 27, 1993 (taped March 2, 1993) *Paul Orndorff defeated Erik Watts in a tournament final to win the WCW World Television Championship on April 4, 1993 (taped March 2, 1993) *Rick Rude (subbing for an injured Kensuke Sasaki) defeated Dustin Rhodes to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship on May 15, 1993 (taped April 20, 1993) *Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) defeated The Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobbs) to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship on June 24, 1995 (taped May 3, 1995) *Dean Malenko defeated Shinjiro Otani to win the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship on May 18, 1996 (taped May 2, 1996) WorldWide in the United Kingdom WCW WorldWide is one of only two American wrestling shows (the other being WWE Sunday Night Heat on Channel 4) to have had a regular slot on UK terrestrial television, having appeared on two different over the air networks during its lifetime. Beginning in 1991, WCW WorldWide was broadcast in the UK on the ITV network originally overnight at 1 or 2 a.m. alongside other U.S. imports such as American Gladiators and America's Top Ten. In spring of 1992 however, it was also broadcast in local British Wrestling's old Saturday afternoon slot. In late 1995, however, the show was moved back to the late night slot and disappeared from the network. During July 1999, Worldwide returned to TV in the UK on Channel 5, who broadcast the show at 7 pm on Friday evenings, although occasionally the show would be broadcast in a late-night mid-week time-slot instead. These shows were a collection of matches from Nitro, Thunder and WCW Saturday Night, which had taken place five or six weeks before. The announcers were usually Scott Hudson and Larry Zbyszko, who provided dubbed commentary with references aimed at the UK viewers. In order to keep the more extreme action suitable for a pre- watershed audience any attacks with weapons such as steel chairs were comically covered over with large, cartoonish effects with \\"BLAM!\\" or \\"SMASH!\\" inside them. Due to being moved around the schedules and skipping some weeks, the show continued until April 20, 2001, three weeks after the final American broadcast. This episode contained re-aired and edited Nitro matches throughout 2001 to the WorldWide theme, and was different from the final American broadcast. Following the purchase of WCW by the WWF, older versions of WorldWide were repeated on Sky Sports.

On 7 April 2017, the district was bifurcated into Purba Bardhaman district and Paschim Bardhaman district. The headquarters of the district was Bardhaman, and it housed the cities of Asansol and Durgapur. Great revolutionary Rashbehari Bose was born in village Subaldaha, Bardhaman district. Bengali poet Kumud Ranjan Mullick was born at Kogram and poet Kazi Nazrul Islam was born at Churulia in the same district. Notable persons like Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyay, Akshay Kumar Datta, Jatindranath Sengupta were also born in erstwhile Bardhaman district. It was the seventh most populous district in India (out of 640) at the time of bifurcation. Etymology Historians link the name of the district to the 24th and last Jain tirthankara, Mahavira Vardhamana, who came to preach in the area. A Jain image is in the collection of ' Vidyasagar Mandir in the Midnapur town . A Jaina brass plaque has been found from a place very close to Katwa ( Burdwan district ) . Jaina figures of rare artistic quality have been discovered in the place. Quite a large number of the mutilated sculptures representing Jaina Tirthankara were noticed within the enclosure of the brick temple of Satdeulia in Burdwan district. History Archaeological excavations/ findings at Pandu Rajar Dhibi and Birbhanpur have indicated settlements in the Ajay and Damodar valleys in the Mesolithic age, around 5,000 BC. Not much is known about the early settlements and the period that followed till around 700 BC in ancient times when the area was referred to as Bardhamanbhukti, which was a part of the Rarh region. It was one the sixteen janapad of ancient India. Large and powerful empires such as the Magadhas, Mauryas, Kushanas and Guptas held sway over the area and beyond it. In the 7th century AD, the area was part of the Gauda Kingdom, then ruled by Shashanka. It was subsequently ruled by the Palas and Senas, till Bakhtiyar Khilji captured it in 1199 AD. The early Muslim rulers ruled over major parts of Bengal from Gauda or Lakhnauti. In the Mughal period Bardhaman is mentioned as a mahal or pargana of Sarcar Sharifabad. Some western parts of Bardhaman was Gopbhum, ruled for many years by the Sadgope kings. The Gopbhum area later became part of the Shergarh and Senpahari parganas. In 1606, Sher Afghan, the jagirdar of Bardhaman, was killed just outside Bardhaman. After Sher Afghan’s death, his wife, Meher-un-Nissa, was taken by Jahangir as his consort, and named Nur Jahan. It was one of the most romantic chapters of Mughal history. In 1622, when Jahangir’s son, Khurram, who later became Shah Jahan, rebelled against his father, he captured the fort of Bardhaman. In 1689, Raja Krishnaram Roy, of the Bardhaman Raj family, obtained a farman (royal decree) from Aurangzeb by which he was made the zamindar (landlord) of Bardhaman, and since then the Raj family's history became identical with that of the district. During the reign of Krishnaram Rai, Subha Singh, zamindar of Chitua and Barda, then part of Bardhaman, raised the standard of revolt in 1696. He was killed by Rajkumari Satyabati, when he tried to outrage her. Kirti Chandra Rai added the parganas of Chitua, Bhurshut, Barda and Manoharshahsi to his territories. He also seized the estates of the Raja of Belghara and attacked and defeated the powerful Raja of Bishnupur. Chitra Sen Ray was conferred the title of Raja by the Mughal emperor in 1740. He was succeeded by Tilakchand Ray, who was also conferred the title of Raja by the Mughal emperor. It was during his rule that East India Company acquired Bardhaman and other areas of Bengal.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Vol I, pp 261-296 After the death of Aurangzeb, the Mughal Empire became weak and Murshid Quli Khan became the Nawab of Bengal, owning only nominal allegiance to the Mughal emperor. At that time Bardhaman was referred to as chakla, a change from the earlier pargana. Subsequently, during the reign of Alivardi Khan, the Bargis attacked and plundered Bardhaman. After the victory of the British in the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the fertile district of Bardhaman, along with Medinipur and Chittagong, was ceded to the East India Company. In 1857, the British Crown took over the administration of the country from the East India Company. In 1765, when East India Company acquired the diwani of Bardhaman, it was composed of Bardhaman, Bankura, Hooghly and a third of Birbhum. Hooghly was separated in 1820, Bankura and Birbhum in 1837. In 1765, Tilakchand Ray was the zamindar of Bardhaman. He controlled 75 parganas and also looked after the law and order. At the time of the Permanent Settlement of Lord Cornwallis in 1793, the chaklas were reduced in size, in order to make them more manageable, and districts were created. Six subdivisions were created in Bardhaman district – Bud Bud in 1846, Katwa, Raniganj, Jahanabad (later named Arambagh), and Bardhaman Sadar in 1847 and Kalna in 1850. The parganas were converted to thanas (police stations). At that time there were 22 thanas in Bardhaman district. Later, Jahanabad was transferred out of Bardhaman. Some minor changes went on taking place.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol I, pp 367-370, Radical Impression. The Permanent Settlement ultimately led to the dismemberment of the Bardhaman estate. As the rajas often failed to pay the rent demands, some parts of the estate were auctioned off. However, there were bright spots. Mahatabchand was appointed additional member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council and in 1877 was allowed to use the title of His Highness before his name. Bijoy Chand Mahatab was conferred the title of Maharajadhiraj by Lord Minto in 1908. Uday Chand Mahtab took over in 1941 and served till abolition of the zamindary system in 1954, after independence of the country.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Vol I, pp 345-365 Bardhaman district was bifurcated into two districts, Purba Bardhaman and Paschim Bardhman, on 7 April 2017. Great revolutionary Rashbehari Bose was born in village Subaldaha, Dist-Purba Bardhaman.5 Geography Bardhaman District had an area of 7,024 km² and a population of 6,895,514 (2001 census). It was bounded on the north by Birbhum and Murshidabad districts, on the east by Nadia District, on the southeast by Hooghly District, on the southwest by Bankura and Purulia districts, and on the northwest by Dhanbad district of Jharkhand. The district had six sub-divisions: Asansol, Sadar (North), Sadar (South), Durgapur, Kalna, and Katwa. =Topography= Burdwan district with its varied tectonic elements and riverine features, is a transitional zone between the Jharkhand plateau which constitutes a portion of peninsular shield in the west and Ganga- Brahmaputra alluvial plain in the north and east. In general the Jharkhand plateau consists of the metasedimentary rocks of precambrian age, Gondwana sedimentary rocks, Rajmahal basalts and upper tertiary sediments. Laterite has developed on these older rocks as well as on early Quaternary sediments. To the south, the alluvial plain merges with Damodar-kasain-Subarnarekha deltaic plains. The western half of the district resembles a promontory jutting out from the hill ranges of Chotonagpur plateau and consists of barren, rocky and rolling country with a laterite soil rising into rocky hillocks, the highest being 227 m. These diversify the otherwise monotonous landscape and lend a special charm to the skyline around Asansol subdivision. Ajoy-barakar divide is a convex plateau, the average altitude being 150 m. The gradient is westerly to the west and to the east it is northerly toward Ajay and southerly toward Damodar below the latitude. The Ajoy-Damodar inter-stream tract is made up of several stows consisting of vales and low convex spurs which run in almost all directions except northeast and thus lends a very complicated character to local relief. =Rivers= The river system in Burdwan includes the Bhagirathi-Hooghly in the east, the Ajoy and its tributaries in the north, and the Dwarakeswar, the Damodar and its branches in the southwest. Besides, there are innumerable Khals and old riverbeds all over the area. The notable rivers and khals are Damodar, Bhagirathi, Barakar, Ajay, Dwarakeswar, Nonia, Singaram, Tamla, Kukua, Kunur, Tumuni, Khari, Banka, Chanda-kanki nala, Behula, Gangur, Brahmani, Khandesvari, Karulia nala, Dwaraka or Babla, Koiya nala, Kandarkahal, Kanadamodar, Kananadi, Ghea, Kakinadi etc. =Soil= Different types of soil are encountered in topographical biological, hydrological, and geological conditions in the Burdwan district. In the west, coarse gritty soil blended with rock fragments is formed from the weathering of pegmatite, quartz veins and conglomeratic sandstones, where as sandy soil characteristic of granite rocks and sandstones. This soil is reddish, medium to coarse in texture, acidic in reaction, low in nitrogen, calcium, phosphate and other plant nutrients. Water holding capacity of this soil increases with depth as well as with the increase of clay portions. Towards the east alluvial soil attains an enormous thickness in the low level plains to the east. These soils are sandy, well drained and slightly acidic. =Minerals= Burdwan was one of the premier districts in India in value of minerals. The Raniganj coalfield was the birthplace of the Indian coal industry. Besides coal, important minerals found in the district are iron ores, calcium carbonate, abrasives, silica bricks and moulding sands, glass sands, building materials, manganese, bauxite, laterite etc. =Water resources= There are many tanks, wells, canals, swamps and bils all over the district. In the Damodar Valley region, there are around 17000 tanks. The Durgapur barrage and Mithon dam have formed two large reservoirs at the southwestern and western periphery of the district. =Forest= The forest areas of the district are chiefly in the lateritic and red soil highlands in the Aushgram PS of Sadar subdivision and in the Asansol subdivision. =National protected area= *Ramnabagan Wildlife Sanctuary =Climate= The district experiences a climate which is transitional between CWg and AW types, where 'C' stands for 'warm temperate rainy climates with mild winter', 'W' for 'dry winter not compensated for by total rain in the rest of the year', 'g ' for 'eastern Ganges type of temperature trend' and 'AW' for 'tropical savanna climates'. Average temperature in hot season is 30 C while at the cold season is 20 C. Average rainfall is 1496 mm. The cold season starts from about the middle of November and continues till the end of February. March to May is dry summerintervened by tropical cyclones and storms. June to September is wet summer while October and November is autumn.

Today, Cluj University of Medicine and Pharmacy bears his name. He was a member of the Romanian Academy and brother of politician Emil Hațieganu. He was also an architect, and his work was part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.  Early life and studies  Zsigmond Purjesz promoted Iuliu Hațieganu as physician, while Iuliu was his university assistant between 1910 and 1918. Iuliu Hațieganu was born on April 14, 1885 in the village of Dârja in the Someș Valley, the fifth of 13 children of the Romanian Greek Catholic priest Hațieganu.\\"Iuliu Hațieganu\\" , Jurnalul.ro, August 9, 2008 He began studying at Blaj, where he had as colleague the future bishop Iuliu Hossu, then studied at the Faculty of Medicine of Franz Joseph University. After completing his doctorate in 1910, he became assistant to professor Zsigmond Puryesz.Florea Marin: Vieți dedicate omului: personalități medicale clujene, vol I. Iuliu Hațieganu, Jozsef Jakabi, Victor Papilian, Cluj, 1993 Since 1914 he was known for performing a study on alimentary galactosury. In 1918, during the Great Union of December 1, Iuliu took part in the Grand National Assembly, where he has urged his colleagues to hold a congress of Transylvanian Romanian doctors. The event was chaired by young doctor on January 29, 1919 in Sibiu. His outstanding merits and Puryesz's vision helped Iuliu Hațieganu to become professor of medical clinic at the University of Cluj and first dean of the Faculty of Medicine between 1919 and 1920.Ștefan Blăjan: Contemporanii și urmașii despre Iuliu Hațieganu, Cluj, 1985 In 1929, Professor Iuliu Hațieganu took over the Cluj branch of Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Romanian People (ASTRA). In the early '30s, he became rector of the University of Cluj, focusing his activity on the importance of a special role of physical education in institutions of higher education. His belief was so strong that in order to attract young people to embrace this bold idea, he organized thematic conferences, published a journal of education, built a sports park in Cluj, hired four physical education teachers. In 1935, Professor Hațieganu wrote: It turned out that physical education is the best method of education, that synergically contribute to strengthening of body and soul, to character building... Hațieganu was very interested in medical research and humans, and to assist all, such that he provided patients free consultations and advice. He was so interested and experienced, that he could establish the diagnosis of a patient only if he saw how he moves and how he looks. Along with one of his students, Professor Ion Goia, Hațieganu developed pathological model theory of peasants and workers, these patients being hospitalized preferentially because they claim better teaching. He was inspired by Hippocrates and Pasteur, and was appointed by Tudor Arghezi as \\"professor of the Romanian medicine\\". Iuliu Hațieganu founded the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Cluj, that exists today, and bears his name since 1993, and was a member of the Romanian Academy. He was well known for interest in the physical education, human health, the creation of the sports parks, but also because of research he has done on tuberculosis.  Basics of Transylvanian medicine  He was known since 1914 in the speciality literature through a study on alimentary galactosury, published in \\"Medical Journal\\" in Budapest. He was one of the university youth delegates to the National Assembly in Alba Iulia and upheld in the face of the Ruling Council of Transylvania the establishment of the University of Cluj. Subsequently, he will chair the first Congress of Physicians, where his friend, military doctor Iuliu Moldovan, appointed by the Ruling Council as secretary of public health problems, will report on the health status of the population in Transylvania, emphasizing the need to resume work at the Faculty of Medicine of Cluj. At 34 years he held his first university lecture in Romanian language in Transylvania, \\"Catarrhal jaundice problem\\", through which he laid the foundations of medical higher education in Cluj. In the interwar period, the medicine in Cluj had the most beautiful and full-time results. Along with Ion Goia, Iuliu Hațieganu gathered to desk outstanding specialists as Victor Papilian, Titu Vasiliu, Iacob Iacobovici, Constantin Ureche, Victor Babeș, Constantin Levaditi or Emil Racoviță. After the Second Vienna Award, Cluj clinics moved to Sibiu. Professor Hațieganu, whose name it bears today the University of Medicine and Pharmacy, was a rare example. But, the great merit of Hațieganu is that he has managed to create an exceptional teaching staff, who went on to date the value of Romanian medicine. Strong personality, he quickly coalesced a team, which was transformed into a professional team of elite, both at desks and in clinics. From own funds, Hațieganu established between 1930-1932 in Cluj a park for youth sports. Iuliu Hațieganu Sports Park, on the shore of Someș River and with an area of 25 ha, was dedicated to the memory of his only child, dead at only 8 years. Currently, it's named after its founder.  The communist period and involvement in politics  With the establishment of communism, the new political situation affected both Hațieganu and his collaborators, many being dismissed under the pretext of so- called \\"popular judgments\\". Between April 29 and July 14, 1931, Iuliu Hațieganu was named Minister of State in Iorga Government. He was also appointed Minister of Health, but early resigned, inasmuch as it was rejected proposal to establish a portfolio of Physical Education.

Many such cables use underwater repeaters or amplifiers to boost signals being passed along the cable. These repeaters or amplifiers are powered from either end of the cable using Power Feed Equipment. This is achieved by applying a voltage to the metallic (usually copper or aluminium) core of the cable that surrounds the optical fiber. Typically both ends share the current generation with one end providing a positive voltage and the other a negative voltage. A virtual ground point exists roughly halfway along the cable under normal operation. The amplifiers or repeaters derive their power from the potential difference drop across them. A shunt fault occurs when the cable insulation becomes damaged, such that there is a short circuit from the metallic core to the seawater directly. In this situation the apparent location of the virtual ground will move to the shunt fault location. As long as the power feed equipment farthest from the shunt fault has the capability of generating the additional voltage required to maintain the same current, the cable system will continue to carry traffic. This damage can be from ship anchors, fishing trawlers, backhoe dredgers, currents dragging the cable along the sea floor, or even sea creatures. A repair will be scheduled at a convenient time whilst the cable continues to operate.

Early life: 1918−1945 Born in Kingston upon Thames, southwest London, Wyatt was the second son of Robert Harvey Lyle Wyatt, the founder and headmaster of Milbourne Lodge School, Esher, and his wife Ethel (née Morgan).Sarah Curtis (ed.), The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume One (London: Pan, 1999), p. xix. Born on America's Independence Day, he was named after the American President Woodrow Wilson.Woodrow Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist (London: Collins, 1987), p. 35. Wyatt was educated at Eastbourne College and Worcester College, Oxford, where he read jurisprudence and graduated with a second-class degree in 1939.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 77. He volunteered for military service ten days before the outbreak of the Second World War with the Suffolk RegimentWyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 78. and rose to the rank of major. Wyatt was posted to Normandy on D-Day plus one and was mentioned in despatches.Matthew Beard and Richard Evans, 'Attlee's young star who went on to back Thatcher', The Times (8 December 1997), p. 9.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 97. He was nearly court-martialled after an acrimonious exchange with one of his senior officers.'Lord Wyatt of Weeford', The Times (9 December 1997), p. 21.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 101. Wyatt was afterwards posted to India.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, pp. 106–113. Wyatt edited ten volumes of English Story (1940–50). Member of Parliament: 1945–1955 Wyatt was elected to Parliament in 1945 as the Labour MP for Birmingham Aston, and served until the 1955 general election when the constituencies boundaries were redrawn. During the Cabinet Mission to India in 1946 he served as an informal liaison officer between the Mission and the Muslim League.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, pp. 145–163. Wyatt was a member of the 15-strong Keep Left group of Labour MPs.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 168. In the group's pamphlet, published in May 1947, Wyatt criticised the government's failure to demobilise the armed forces quickly enough.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 169. Clement Attlee appointed Wyatt Under-Secretary at the War Office in April 1951, an office he held for six months until Labour was defeated in the October 1951 election. He published Into the Dangerous World in 1952. Following the splitting of his Aston seat, Wyatt was unable to find a more promising option than the Conservative-held Grantham constituency, which he nonetheless fought in 1955, being defeated by 2,375 votes. By coincidence, Grantham was the hometown of his latter-day friend Margaret Thatcher. Journalism: 1955–1959 Edward R. Murrow of CBS chose Grantham as one of the seats that he would cover during the 1955 election. Grace Wyndham Goldie, who was the head of the BBC's Current Affairs department, happened to watch it and was impressed with Wyatt.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 231. She asked Wyatt to join Richard Dimbleby in presenting Panorama as the programme's foreign affairs reporter.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 238. He later wrote: \\"My TV appearances catapulted me into fame. ... We had an audience of between 9 and 14 million. When I walked in the street or went into any public place I was recognized and my autograph sought\\".Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 242. In February 1956, during the filming of a Panorama programme in Algeria, Wyatt and his television crew were attacked by French settlers who had mistaken them for Americans.'Alarm Over Algeria', The Times (28 February 1956), p. 8.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, pp. 242–243. In April 1956 Bill Carron, a member of the executive of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU), informed Wyatt that Communists were trying to take over the union by falsifying votes for union officials.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, pp. 249–250. There were upcoming elections for two posts on the Executive and as the Communists already held three out of the seven seats, there was a possibility of a Communist majority. Wyatt later wrote: \\"The threat to the economy and to the Labour Party of a huge AEU block vote supporting extremist policies at Labour conferences, was obvious\\".Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 250. The Director-General of the BBC, Sir Ian Jacob, authorised Wyatt to produce a Panorama programme on it, which was broadcast on 14 May 1956.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, pp. 250–251. Wyatt later claimed that his programme \\"shook the union world. The voting went up by 40 per cent. ... it was enough to defeat the Communist candidates for all three posts. The AEU was saved\\".Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 251. In September 1956 he wrote a series of articles in the Illustrated about the Communist threat to the trade unions and therefore, due to the influential trade union block vote, to the Labour Party. These were republished in pamphlet-form as The Peril in Our Midst.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 254. In October 1956 he signed a statement urging British participation in the Common Market.'Britain Urged To Cooperate', The Times (8 October 1956), p. 4. In June 1957 Wyatt visited South Africa under apartheid for Panorama. He later wrote that the treatment of black South Africans was \\"worse than that of slaves in Ancient Athens or Rome\\" and that his programme was \\"the first time that millions in Britain got a glimpse of what life was really like in South Africa: paradise under a live volcano\\".Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, pp. 248–249. Eric Louw, the South African Minister of External Affairs, made an official complaint to the British government about Wyatt's programme.'A \\"Distorted\\" Programme', The Times (5 July 1957), p. 10. After Wyatt's programme on Communist vote-rigging in the AEU, Jock Byrne gave Wyatt documents containing evidence that since the war Communists had controlled the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) by falsifying votes.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 252. Wyatt received the permission of Ian Jacob to make a Panorama programme on union democracy in the ETU. This was broadcast on 9 December 1957 and Wyatt brought to light that Les Cannon had been defrauded of his election to the ETU's Executive by Communist vote- rigging. As union rules prohibited union members from discussing union affairs in public, ETU members on Wyatt's programme had their faces hidden.'E.T.U. attacked on television', The Times (10 December 1957), p. 6. In January 1958 Wyatt wrote an article on the subject for the New Statesman.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 256. In July 1961 Justice Win of the High Court declared that the 1959 election for the ETU's general secretary was fraudulently won by the Communist Frank Haxell and that Byrne was the general secretary.'Judge Declares Mr. Byrne To Be E.T.U. Secretary', The Times (4 July 1961), p. 10.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 259. He also campaigned in favour of compulsory secret ballots for union elections, which was eventually embodied in the Employment Act 1988.Julian Lewis, 'Woodrow Wyatt', The Times (17 December 1997), p. 19. In January 1958 the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party rejected a request from the Holborn and St Pancras constituency Labour Party that Wyatt should be removed from the list of prospective parliamentary candidates due to his \\"anti-working class activity\\".'News in Brief', The Times (23 January 1958), p. 7.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, pp. 256–257. Member of Parliament: 1959–1970 He returned to Parliament in 1959 as member for Bosworth, Leicestershire. According to Wyatt, Gaitskell told him that the Opposition Chief Whip, Bert Bowden, vetoed his appointment to Gaitskell's Shadow Cabinet.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 272. In a speech to the Hinckley branch of the AEU in June 1960, Wyatt called the General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, Frank Cousins, \\"the bully with the block vote\\".'\\"Bully of the Block Vote\\"', The Times (11 June 1960), p. 12. After Labour's fourth successive electoral defeat in 1992, Anthony Howard said that Labour's own polling evidence suggested that Labour could not win another election so long as it was identified with the trade unions: \\"Woodrow Wyatt's description of the late Frank Cousins...as “the bully with the block vote” was not just a damaging phrase: in the electorate's perception of Labour it lit a candle that has never really gone out\\".Anthony Howard, 'Labour needs its carthorse', The Times (24 June 1992), p. 14. In November 1961, Wyatt wrote an article for The Guardian and delivered a speech in Leicester, both times advocating a Lib–Lab pact to keep the Conservatives out of power.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 277.'Labour Pact With Liberals Urged', The Times (20 November 1961), p. 6. According to Wyatt, a furious Gaitskell telephoned him, saying: \\"Why don't you get out of the Party and stop embarrassing me?\\"Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 278. In January 1962, after Wyatt repeated this idea in an article for the New Statesman, Gaitskell delivered a speech to the Bosworth Labour Party (in Wyatt's presence) rejecting it.'Mr. Gaitskell Says No Liberal Pact', The Times (27 January 1962), p. 8. The General Secretary of the Labour Party, Morgan Phillips, wrote to Wyatt, warning him that unless he dropped his advocacy for a Lib−Lab pact, he would be expelled from the party. Wyatt acquiesced.Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 280. He was seen by some as a maverick and by others as a man of firm convictions which made him temperamentally unsuited to 'toeing the party line'. He rebelled in the 1964–1970 parliaments over steel nationalisation. His thirteen interviews with Bertrand Russell were published as Bertrand Russell Speaks His Mind in 1960. Wyatt was defeated at the 1970 general election. Journalism and The Tote: 1970–1997 After ceasing to be an active politician, Wyatt was appointed by the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, as Chairman of the Horserace Totalisator Board from 1976–1997. At first he was an active chairman, rooting out corruption, but later grew complacent and the Tote stagnated.\\"To Move and To Shake\\" by Geraldine Bedell. The Independent on Sunday, 24 November 1996. According to John McCririck: \\"The Tote had been bankrupt and he turned it round. He made it a force in betting. When he became chairman, the Tote was a total mess but he put it on the map by his sheer personality and flair along with the introduction of computerisation\\". However, a House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee produced a report critical of Wyatt. Wyatt was a prolific journalist, with a diverse range of interests, and by the late 1970s he had crossed the political spectrum and became an admirer of Margaret Thatcher. After Thatcher's election as Conservative leader in 1975, she arranged a meeting with Wyatt. He later wrote: \\"She won me over. The strength of her determination and the simplicity of her rational ideas uncluttered by intellectual confusion convinced me that she was the first party leader I had met, apart from Gaitskell, who might check Britain's slide and possibly begin to reverse it. She did not seem much like a Tory but she had the Tory Party to work for her, which was a useful start\\".Wyatt, Confessions of an Optimist, p. 343. In July 1979 Roy Jenkins recorded in his diary after meeting Wyatt and Thatcher: \\"Woodrow is on very close terms with her, talks freely, easily, without self-consciousness, says anything he wants to\\".Roy Jenkins, European Diary, 1977−1981 (London: Collins, 1989), p. 480. Wyatt would usually ring Thatcher after midnight or on Sunday mornings where he would give her advice.John Campbell, Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 34. According to John Campbell, Thatcher did not always accept Wyatt's advice but \\"her ministers got sick of being told what 'Woodrow says' about this or that policy\\". He claims that when Geoffrey Howe complained in his memoirs that Thatcher preferred to listen to her private \\"voices\\" rather than to her colleagues and official advisers, \\"it was first and foremost of Wyatt that he was thinking\\". During this period his News of the World column, 'The Voice of Reason', was regularly attacked by Thatcher's political opponents. His column reached an audience of approximately seventeen million readers.Sarah Curtis, 'Introduction', The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt, p. xii. During this time he was vocal in opposing sanctions against apartheid South Africa, writing that Nelson Mandela and the ANC were trying to establish \\"a communist-style black dictatorship\\". Wyatt visited South Africa in 1986 and during a visit to a game reserve he saw black and white children playing together, leading him to remark: \\"They are comrades. Oh, if the rest of South Africa could be like that\\".Curtis, The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume One, p. 93. He also interviewed President Botha and put to him that he should unban the ANC.Curtis, The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume One, p. 95. He was knighted in 1983 and was created a life peer on 3 February 1987 with the title Baron Wyatt of Weeford, of Weeford in the County of Staffordshire. The Wyatt family had lived at Weeford in the seventeenth century.Burke's Landed Gentry 1952, 'Wyatt of Hurst Barton Manor formerly of Bryn Gwynant', pp. 2805 His autobiography, Confessions of an Optimist, was published in 1985. In the mid-1980s he played a key role as Murdoch's fixer in brokering negotiations with the electricians' union, aiding News International to move to Wapping. He set up a newspaper and printing business with his third wife, which soon failed. On 31 August 1986 the Press Council censured Wyatt for an article he wrote in his \\"Voice of Reason\\" column. Wyatt said that although Britain's Asian and black population were \\"generally well behaved\\", a substantial part of the latter were \\"lawless, drug-taking, violent and unemployable\\".'Race rebuke writer is defended by Tory MP', The Times (1 September 1986), p. 4.Curtis, The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume One, p. 186. After Thatcher's fall in 1990, Wyatt supported John Major. However, he temporarily dropped his support for Major after he sacked his Chancellor, Norman Lamont, in 1993. Wyatt helped Lamont write his resignation speech. In 2000, the journalist Petronella Wyatt, his daughter by his fourth marriage, published a book entitled Father, Dear Father: Life with Woodrow Wyatt. The Journals Wyatt's diary cover (published posthumously as The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt by Macmillan, edited by Sarah Curtis) Wyatt's caustic, candid and mischievously indiscreet diaries were published posthumously in three volumes as The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt by Macmillan and edited by Sarah Curtis. They are: Volume 1, 1985–88 (1998); Volume 2, Thatcher's Fall and Major's Rise, 1989–92, (1999); and Volume 3, From Major to Blair (2000), which spans the period from 1992 until three months before his death in December 1997. Andrew Neil in the New Statesman wrote of the diaries: \\"Wyatt has done the country a service in giving us the unalloyed truth about how this country's governing and social elite still operates\\", and the Daily Express called the journals \\"The most explosive political memoirs of modern times\\". However, the historian Robert Rhodes James \\"advised caution in believing them: 'Even if the diarist is not attempting to give a deliberately false version, a talented writer can easily over-dramatise...' There is plenty of internal evidence that Wyatt should be approached with a similar caution.\\"David Sexton, \\"Don't believe all those diary droolings\\", The Evening Standard (12 October 1998), p. 11. Lord Blake, the Tory historian, called Wyatt a \\"notorious liar\\". Charles Moore, Thatcher's authorised biographer, claims Wyatt's journals \\"are a good source for the 'off duty' remarks and attitudes of many of the leading figures of the age, including Mrs Thatcher. They often reveal her private reactions to public events when she considered herself among friends\\".Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher, Volume One: Not For Turning (London: Allen Lane, 2013), p. 467, n.

He arranged for cousins to take care of his first child when his wife made it clear she was not interested in doing so. When they divorced, he was awarded custody of his son. Wyatt was a first cousin of England Test cricketer Bob Wyatt. He was a descendant of the architectural Wyatt family.Confessions of an Optimist, Woodrow Wyatt, Collins, 1985, p. 22Different Every Time: The Authorised Biography of Robert Wyatt, Marcus O'Dair, Profile Books, 2014, p. 6Burke's Landed Gentry 1952, 'Wyatt of Hurst Barton Manor formerly of Bryn Gwynant', pp. 2805–06 He was first cousin to Honor Wyatt, the mother of musician Robert Wyatt, whose alliance with the Communist Party of Great Britain, juxtaposed with Woodrow Wyatt's right-wing politics, led to Robert Wyatt referring to his relative as an \\"appalling man with a sadistic sense of superiority\\". He died in Camden, north London, aged 79. He is buried in St Mary's churchyard in Weeford, just south of Lichfield, Staffordshire, where the Wyatt family originated.

It can be used to answer questions such as \\"How far can a carton of eggs fall, on average, before one breaks?\\" If these egg cartons are very expensive, the person running the test would like to minimize the number of cartons dropped, to keep the experiment cheaper and to perform it faster. The Neyer test allows the experimenter to choose the experiment that gives the most information. In this case, given the history of egg cartons which have already been dropped, and whether those cartons broke or not, the Neyer test says \\"you will learn the most if you drop the next egg carton from a height of 32.123 meters.\\"  Applications  The Neyer test is useful in any situation when you wish to determine the average amount of a given stimulus needed in order to trigger a response. Examples: * Material Toughness - how far does this type of bottle filled with detergent need to fall before it breaks? * Drug Efficacy - how much of this drug is enough to cure this diseases? * Toxicology - what percentage of contaminated seed is enough to cause a bird of this species to die? * Sensory Threshold - how strong does the light have to be for this photodetector to sense it? * Damage Threshold - how loud does the sound have to be in order to damage this microphone ?  History  The Neyer-d optimal test was described by Barry T. Neyer in 1994. This method has replaced the earlier Bruceton analysis or \\"Up and Down Test\\" that was devised by Dixon and Mood in 1948 to allow computation with pencil and paper. Samples are tested at various stimulus levels, and the results (response or no response) noted. The Neyer Test guides the experimenter to pick test levels that provide the maximum amount of information. Unlike previous methods that have been developed, this method requires the use of a computer program to calculate the test levels. Although not directly related to the test method, the likelihood ratio analysis method is often used to analyze the results of tests conducted with the Neyer D-Optimal test. The combined test and analysis methods are commonly known as the Neyer Test. Dror and Steinberg (2008) suggest another experimental design method which is more efficient than Neyer's, by enabling the usage of a D-optimal design criterion from the outset of the experiment. Furthermore, their method is extended to deal with situations which are not handled by previous algorithms, including extension from fully sequential designs (updating the plan after each observation) to group-sequential designs (any partition of the experiment to blocks of numerous observations), from a binary response (\\"success\\" or \\"failure\\") to any generalized linear model, and from the univariate case to the treatment of multiple predictors (such as designing an experiment to test a response in a medical treatment where the experimenters changes doses of two different drugs).

Ecology This shrub is a member of many plant communities and grows in many types of habitat, including California chaparral and woodlands, coastal sage scrub, and California oak woodlands. It grows in forest types such as foggy coastal oak woodlands, Coast redwood forests, California mixed evergreen forests, and mountain coniferous forests. It can be found alongside chaparral whitethorn (Ceanothus leucodermis), toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), skunkbush (Rhus trilobata), redberry (Rhamnus crocea), and western poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum). In brushy mountain habitat it grows among many species of manzanita. The plant reproduces sexually by seed and vegetatively by sprouting. After wildfire or cutting, the plant generally resprouts from its root crown. Reproduction via seed is most common in mature stands of the plant. It produces seeds by 2 or 3 years of age. Seeds are mature in the fall. Seed dispersal is often performed by birds, which are attracted to the fruit; some plants are so stripped of fruit by birds that hardly any seeds fall below the parent plant. This long-lived plant is persistent and becomes a dominant species in many habitat types, such as coastal woodlands. In the absence of wildfire, the shrub can grow large, with a wide spread that can shade out other flora. When fire occurs, the plant can be very damaged but it readily resprouts from the surviving root crown, which is covered in buds for the purpose. It reaches its pre-burn size relatively quickly. Parts of the plant, including the foliage and fruit, are food for wild animals such as mule deer, black bears, and many resident and migrating birds, as well as livestock. Uses =Cultivation= This plant is cultivated as an ornamental plant by plant nurseries, for planting in native plant, water conserving, and wildlife gardens; in large pots and containers; and in natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects.NPIN—Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center: Frangula californica (California buckthorn, California Coffeeberry)Las Pilitas Horticulture Database: Frangula (Rhamnus) californica (Coffeeberry)California Native Plant Society, \\"Gardening with Natives\\" blog: Frangula californica (California Coffeeberry); posted September 28, 2010; accessed 4.4.2015Native Plants Network.org: Propagation protocol for production of container Frangula californica It is also used for erosion control, and is usually deer resistant.

The seeds inside the berries have been used to make coffee substitute. Although the plant itself looks much like a coffee plant, its berries, which are succulent, do not. Native Americans of the west coast of North America had several uses for the plant as food, and used parts of it as a traditional medicinal plant. Several tribes of the indigenous peoples of California ate the fruit fresh or dried.University of Michigan, Dearborn − Native American Ethnobotany: Frangula californica . accessed 4.4.2015 The Ohlone people used the leaves to treat poison oak dermatitis. The Kumeyaay people had similar uses for its bark. The Kawaiisu used the fruit to treat wounds such as burns. The bark was widely used as a laxative by the indigenous peoples. Names for the plant in the Konkow language of the Concow tribe include pä and pö.

Hutchinson Letters leak Benjamin Franklin acquired a packet of about twenty letters that had been written to Thomas Whately, an assistant to Prime Minister George Grenville.Penegar, p. 27. Penegar notes that there are varying interpretations on how many letters constitute the set at issue. Upon reading them, Franklin concluded that Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson and his colonial secretary (plus brother-in-law) Andrew Oliver, had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies, and thus misled Parliament. He felt that wider knowledge of these letters would then focus colonial anger away from Parliament and at those who had written the misleading letters.Bailyn, p. 236 Franklin sent the letters to Thomas Cushing, the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly, in December 1772.Morgan, p. 187 He specifically wrote to Cushing that the letters should be seen only by a few people, and that he was not \\"at liberty to make the letters public.\\"Wright, p. 225 The letters arrived in Massachusetts in March 1773, and came into the hands of Samuel Adams, then serving as the clerk of the Massachusetts assembly.Alexander, p. 150 By Franklin's instructions, only a select few people, including the Massachusetts Committee of Correspondence, were to see the letters.Bailyn, p. 239 Alarmed at what they read, Cushing wrote Franklin, asking if the restrictions on their circulation could be eased. In a response received by Cushing in early June, Franklin reiterated that they were not to be copied or published, but could be shown to anyone A longtime opponent of Hutchinson's, Samuel Adams informed the assembly of the existence of the letters, after which it designated a committee to analyze them. Strategic leaks suggestive of their content made their way into the press and political discussions, causing Hutchinson much discomfort. The assembly eventually concluded, according to John Hancock, that in the letters Hutchinson sought to \\"overthrow the Constitution of this Government, and to introduce arbitrary Power into the Province\\", and called for the removal of Hutchinson and Oliver.Alexander, p. 151 Hutchinson complained that Adams and the opposition were misrepresenting what he had written, and that nothing he had written in them on the subject of Parliamentary supremacy went beyond other statements he had made.Alexander, p. 152 The letters were finally published in the Boston Gazette in mid-June 1773,Bailyn, p. 240 causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England.Penegar, p. 29 American Revolution For years before the first shots were fired at Lexington Green, Samuel Adams, Joseph Warren, Josiah Quincy, James Otis, Edes and Gill were writing article after article in the Boston Gazette, rebelling against royal authority. Adams wrote so many articles, under so many pen names (at least 25), historians don't even know exactly how many he wrote.

Ajmer geography  The eastern portion of the district is generally flat, broken only by gentle undulations. The western parts, from north-west to south-west, are intersected by the Aravalli Range. Many of the valleys in this region are sandy deserts, part of India's Thar Desert, with an occasional oasis of cultivation. Some fertile tracts are also present; among these is the plain on which lies the town of Ajmer. This valley has an artificial lake, and is protected by the massive walls of the Nagpathar range or Serpent rock, which forms a barrier against the sand. The only hills in the district are the Aravalli Range and its offshoots. Ajmer is almost totally devoid of rivers. The Banas River touches the south-eastern boundary of the district so as to irrigate the pargana of Samur. Four small streams—the Sagarmati, Saraswati, Khari and Dai—also intersect the district. The district is divided into four subdivisions, Ajmer, Beawar, Kekri and Kishangarh, and further subdivided into nine tehsils, Ajmer, Beawar, Bhinai, Sarwar, Pisangan, Tantoti, Nasirabad, Masuda, Kekri, Kishangarh.

Being a restless person, with an unusual working class feeling, he soon made contact with a group of intellectuals and artists of \\"neo-realismo\\" (the Portuguese wave of the socialist realism), such as Soeiro Pereira Gomes and Alves Redol that developed their political work in his home town, Vila Franca de Xira. After that contact, he adhered to the Communist Youth Federation at the age of 15 and soon began his career as a revolutionary. Still a teenager, he was an active voice in the organization of the vast wave of strikes that frightened the Portuguese Fascist regime, led by Oliveira Salazar, in 1944. His brother Carlos was murdered in prison, along with Alfredo Dinis (Alex) and some other top members of the Communist Party at the time. 1976 - Alvaro Cunhal, Portuguese Communist Party's General Secretary & Octavio Pato, Party's presidential candidate, at Campo Pequeno, Lisboa In 1945 he plunged into clandestinity, controlling and organizing the youth and student branches of the Party. In 1947 he became responsible for the Lisbon Regional organization and for the party newspaper, Avante!, and the clandestine typographies where the newspaper was printed. He also joined the Central Committee. He soon became prosecuted by the anti-communist political police, PIDE, being arrested in 1961. He was beaten and tortured continuously. He endured 11 and then another 7 days standing sleepless (a usual torture method carried by the police), suffered a syncope and near death experience. Was kept isolated for 4 months. He didn't speak a word to his captors. Taken to court, Pato was defended by his long-time friend, the social-democrat Mário Soares (that would become the leader of the Portuguese Socialist Party and President of Portugal). Pato made a very famous political speech in his defense. He said he was proud to belong to the PCP and stated his belief in Marxism-Leninism. He reminded the judges of his imprisoned wife and sons and of his murdered comrades. He also claimed that his judgment was an attempt on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He qualified the regime as an executive at the service of the monopolists and the latifundia and criticized the country presence in NATO. At one point, the masters of the show just couldn't stand it anymore. Police agents started beating him up with clubs right on his accused stand, in front of the judges. Soares screamed in protest at the bar. To no avail. Pato was evacuated from the court and his sentence was read to him in his cell: 8 years in prison that could be adjourned (fascist political sentences were open-ended). Pato got out of jail in 1970 and plunged again in clandestinity in 1972.

This lack of consensus is reflected in debates about the genre's history, particularly over determining its exact origins. There are two broad camps of thought, one that identifies the genre's roots in early fantastical works such as the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh (earliest Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE). A second approach argues that science fiction only became possible sometime between the 17th and early 19th centuries, following the scientific revolution and major discoveries in astronomy, physics, and mathematics. Question of deeper origins aside, science fiction developed and boomed in the 20th century, as the deep integration of science and inventions into daily life encouraged a greater interest in literature that explores the relationship between technology, society, and the individual. Scholar Robert Scholes calls the history of science fiction \\"the history of humanity's changing attitudes toward space and time ... the history of our growing understanding of the universe and the position of our species in that universe.\\" In recent decades, the genre has diversified and become firmly established as a major influence on global culture and thought. Early science fiction Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea illustration by Neuville and Riou 044. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is considered one of the earliest works of modern science fiction. =Ancient and early modern precursors= There are a number of ancient or early modern texts including a great many epics and poems that contain fantastical or \\"science-fictional\\" elements, yet were written before the emergence of science fiction as a distinct genre. These texts often include elements such as a fantastical voyage to the moon or the use of imagined advanced technology. Although fantastical and science fiction-like elements and imagery exist in stories such as Ovid's Metamorphoses (8 AD), the Old English epic heroic poem Beowulf (8th-11th centuries AD), and the Middle German epic poem Nibelungenlied (c. 1230), their relative lack of references to science or technology puts them closer to fantasy rather than science fiction. One of the earliest and most commonly-cited texts for those looking for early precursors to science fiction is the ancient Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, with the earliest text versions identified as being from about 2000 BC. American science fiction author Lester del Rey was one such supporter of using Gilgamesh as an origin point, arguing that \\"science fiction is precisely as old as the first recorded fiction. That is the Epic of Gilgamesh.\\" French science fiction writer Pierre Versins also argued that Gilgamesh was the first science fiction work due to its treatment of human reason and the quest for immortality. In addition, Gilgamesh features a flood scene that in some ways resembles work of apocalyptic science fiction. However, the lack of explicit science or technology in the work has led some to argue that it is better categorized as fantastic literature. 1923 Illustration of the Shakuna Vimana Ancient Indian poetry such as the Hindu epic Ramayana (5th to 4th century BC) includes Vimana flying machines able to travel into space or under water, and destroy entire cities using advanced weapons. In the first book of the Rigveda collection of Sanskrit hymns (1700–1100 BC), there is a description of \\"mechanical birds\\" that are seen \\"jumping into space speedily with a craft using fire and water... containing twelve stamghas (pillars), one wheel, three machines, 300 pivots, and 60 instruments.\\" The ancient Hindu mythological epic, the Mahabharata (8th and 9th centuries BC) includes the story of King Kakudmi, who travels to heaven to meet the creator Brahma and is shocked to learn that many ages have passed when he returns to Earth, anticipating the concept of time travel. Ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes has several works that include elements often associated with the \\"fantastic voyage\\", including air travel to another world. Examples include his The Clouds (423 BC), The Birds (414 BC) and The Peace. Aubrey Beardsley illustration of Lucian's interplanetary giant spider battle One frequently cited text is the Syrian-Greek writer Lucian's 2nd-century satire True History, which uses a voyage to outer space and conversations with alien life forms to comment on the use of exaggeration within travel literature and debates. Typical science fiction themes and topoi in True History include travel to outer space, encounter with alien life-forms (including the experience of a first encounter event), interplanetary warfare and planetary imperialism, motif of giganticism, creatures as products of human technology, worlds working by a set of alternative physical laws, and an explicit desire of the protagonist for exploration and adventure.Fredericks, S.C.: \\"Lucian's True History as SF\\", Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 3, No. 1 (March 1976), pp. 49–60 In witnessing one interplanetary battle between the People of the Moon and the People of the Sun as the fight for the right to colonize the Morning Star, Lucian describes giant space spiders who were \\"appointed to spin a web in the air between the Moon and the Morning Star, which was done in an instant, and made a plain campaign upon which the foot forces were planted...\\" L. Sprague de Camp and a number of other authors argue this to be one of the earliest if not the earliest example of science fiction or proto-science fiction. Grewell, Greg: \\"Colonizing the Universe: Science Fictions Then, Now, and in the (Imagined) Future\\", Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature, Vol. 55, No. 2 (2001), pp. 25–47 (30f.)Swanson, Roy Arthur: \\"The True, the False, and the Truly False: Lucian's Philosophical Science Fiction\\", Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 3, No. 3 (Nov. 1976), pp. 227–239 Georgiadou, Aristoula and Larmour, David H.J.: \\"Lucian's Science Fiction Novel True Histories. Interpretation and Commentary\\", Mnemosyne Supplement 179, Leiden 1998, , Introduction Gunn, James E.: \\"The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\\", Publisher: Viking 1988, , p.249. Gunn calls the novel \\"proto-science fiction\\". However, since the text was intended to be explicitly satirical and hyperbolic, other critics are ambivalent about its rightful place as a science fiction precursor. For example, English critic Kingsley Amis wrote that \\"It is hardly science- fiction, since it deliberately piles extravagance upon extravagance for comic effect\\" yet he implicitly acknowledged its SF character by comparing its plot to early 20th-century space operas: \\"I will merely remark that the sprightliness and sophistication of True History make it read like a joke at the expense of nearly all early-modern science fiction, that written between, say, 1910 and 1940.\\"Kingsley, Amis: \\"New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction\\", New York 1960, p.28 Lucian translator Bryan Reardon is more explicit, describing the work as \\"an account of a fantastic journey - to the moon, the underworld, the belly of a whale, and so forth. It is not really science fiction, although it has sometimes been called that; there is no 'science' in it.\\" Kaguya-hime returning to the Moon in The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter The early Japanese tale of \\"Urashima Tarō\\" involves traveling forwards in time to a distant future, and was first described in the Nihongi (720). It was about a young fisherman named Urashima Taro who visits an undersea palace and stays there for three days. After returning home to his village, he finds himself three hundred years in the future, where he is long forgotten, his house in ruins, and his family long dead. The 10th-century Japanese narrative The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter may also be considered proto-science fiction. The protagonist of the story, Kaguya-hime, is a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, and is found and raised by a bamboo cutter in Japan. She is later taken back to the Moon by her real extraterrestrial family. A manuscript illustration depicts a round flying machine similar to a flying saucer. =One Thousand and One Nights= Several stories within the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights, 8th-10th century CE) also feature science fiction elements. One example is \\"The Adventures of Bulukiya\\", where the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to the Garden of Eden and to Jahannam, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinn, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In \\"Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman\\", the protagonist gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other Arabian Nights tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. \\"The City of Brass\\" features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass robot horseman who directs the party towards the ancient city. Arabic manuscript of the One Thousand and One Nights \\"The Ebony Horse\\" features a robot in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the \\"Third Qalandar's Tale\\" also features a robot in the form of an uncanny sailor. \\"The City of Brass\\" and \\"The Ebony Horse\\" can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction. (cf. )Academic Literature, Islam and Science Fiction Other examples of early Arabic proto- science fiction include al-Farabi's Opinions of the residents of a splendid city about a utopian society, and certain Arabian Nights elements such as the flying carpet.Achmed A. W. Khammas, Science Fiction in Arabic Literature =Other medieval literature= According to Roubi, the final two chapters of the Arabic theological novel Fādil ibn Nātiq (c. 1270), also known as Theologus Autodidactus, by the Arabian polymath writer Ibn al-Nafis (1213-1288) can be described as science fiction. The theological novel deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation, futurology, apocalyptic themes, eschatology, resurrection and the afterlife, but rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using his own extensive scientific knowledge in anatomy, biology, physiology, astronomy, cosmology and geology. For example, it was through this novel that Ibn al- Nafis introduces his scientific theory of metabolism,Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), \\"Ibn al-Nafis as a philosopher\\", Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis, Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait (cf. Ibnul-Nafees As a Philosopher, Encyclopedia of Islamic World ) and he makes references to his own scientific discovery of the pulmonary circulation in order to explain bodily resurrection. The novel was later translated into English as Theologus Autodidactus in the early 20th century. During the European Middle Ages, science fictional themes appeared within many chivalric romance and legends. Robots and automata featured in romances starting in the twelfth century, with Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne and Eneas among the first.J. Douglas Bruce (1913). Human Automata in Classical Tradition and Medieval Romance, 5-6. The Roman de Troie, another twelfth-century work, features the famous Chambre de Beautes, which contained four automata, one of which held a magic mirror, one of which performed somersaults, one of which played musical instruments, and one which showed people what they most needed.J. Douglas Bruce (1913). Human Automata in Classical Tradition and Medieval Romance, 7. Automata in these works were often ambivalently associated with necromancy, and frequently guarded entrances or provided warning of intruders.E. R. Truitt (2004). \\"Trei Poete, Sages Dotors, Qui Mout Sorent Di Nigromance\\": Knowledge and Automata in Twelfth-Century French Literature, 171. This association with necromancy often leads to the appearance of automata guarding tombs, as they do in Eneas, Floris and Blancheflour, and Le Roman d’Alexandre, while in Lancelot they appear in an underground palace.E. R. Truitt (2004). \\"Trei Poete, Sages Dotors, Qui Mout Sorent Di Nigromance\\": Knowledge and Automata in Twelfth-Century French Literature, 172. Automata did not have to be human, however. A brass horse is among the marvelous gifts given to the Cambyuskan in Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Squire's Tale\\". This metal horse is reminiscent of similar metal horses in middle eastern literature, and could take its rider anywhere in the world at extraordinary speed by turning a peg in its ear and whispering certain words in its ear.Patricia Clare Ingham (2009). Little Nothings: The Squire's Tale and the Ambition of Gadgets. The brass horse is only one of the technological marvels which appears in The Squire's Tale: the Cambyuskan, or Khan also receives a mirror which reveals distant places, which the witnessing crowd explains as operating by the manipulation of angles and optics, and a sword which deals and heals deadly wounds, which the crowd explains as being possible using advanced smithing techniques. Technological inventions are also rife in the Alexander romances. In John Gower's Confessio Amantis, for example, Alexander the Great constructs a flying machine by tying two griffins to a platform and dangling meat above them on a pole. This adventure is ended only by the direct intervention of God, who destroys the device and throws Alexander back to the ground. This does not, however, stop the legendary Alexander, who proceeds to have constructed a gigantic orb of glass which he uses to travel beneath the water. There he sees extraordinary marvels which eventually exceed his comprehension.Scott Lightsey (2007). Manmade Marvels in Medieval Literature and Culture, 127. States similar to suspended animation also appear in medieval romances, such as the Histora Destructionis Troiae and the Roman d’Eneas. In the former, king Priam has the body of the hero Hector entombed in a network of golden tubes that run through his body. Through these tubes ran the semi-legendary fluid balsam which was then reputed to have the power to preserve life. This fluid kept the corpse of Hector preserved as if he was still alive, maintaining him in a persistent vegetative state during which autonomic processes such as the growth of facial hair continued.E. R. Truitt (2009). The Virtues of Balm in Medieval Literature, 727-8 The boundaries between medieval fiction with scientific elements and medieval science can be fuzzy at best. In works such as Geoffrey Chaucer \\"The House of Fame\\", it is proposed that the titular House of Fame is the natural home of sound, described as a ripping in the air, towards which all sound is eventually attracted, in the same way that the earth was believed to be the natural home of earth to which it was all eventually attracted.https://machias.edu/faculty/necastro/chaucer/translation/hf/hf.html 781-842 Likewise, medieval travel narratives often contained science-fictional themes and elements. Works such as Mandeville's Travels included automata, alternate species and sub-species of humans, including Cynoencephali and Giants, and information about the sexual reproduction of diamonds. However, Mandeville's Travels and other travel narratives in its genre mix real geographical knowledge with knowledge now known to be fictional, and it is therefore difficult to distinguish which portions should be considered science fictional or would have been seen as such in the Middle Ages. =Proto-science fiction in the Enlightenment and Age of Reason= In the wake of scientific discoveries that characterized the Enlightenment, several new types of literature began to take shape in 16th-century Europe. The humanist thinker Thomas More's 1516 work of fiction and political philosophy entitled Utopia describes a fictional island whose inhabitants have perfected every aspect of their society. The name of the society stuck, giving rise to the Utopia motif that would become so widespread in later science fiction to describe a world that is seemingly perfect but either ultimately unattainable or perversely flawed. The Faust legend (1587) contains an early prototype for the \\"mad scientist story\\".Christopher P. Toumey - The Moral Character of Mad Scientists: A Cultural Critique of Science, Sage Publications, Inc, Science, Technology, & Human Values, Vol. 17, Nr. 4 , Autumn 1992. pp. 417 Frontispiece of the 1659 German translation of Godwin's The Man in the Moone In the 17th and 18th centuries, the so-called \\"Age of Reason\\" and widespread interest in scientific discovery fueled the creation of speculative fiction that anticipated many of the tropes of more recent science fiction. Several works expanded on imaginary voyages to the moon, first in Johannes Kepler's Somnium (The Dream, 1634), which both Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov have referred to as the first work of science fiction. Similarly, some identify Francis Godwin's The Man in the Moone (1638) as the first work of science fiction in English, and Cyrano de Bergerac's Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon (1656). Space travel also figures prominently in Voltaire's Micromégas (1752), which is also notable for the suggestion that people of other worlds may be in some ways more advanced than those of earth. Other proto-science fiction from the Age of Reason of the 17th and 18th centuries includes (in chronological order): *Shakespeare's The Tempest (1610–11) contains a prototype for the \\"mad scientist story\\". *Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (1627), an incomplete utopian novel. *Margaret Cavendish's The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing-World (1666), a novel that describes an alternate world found in the Arctic by a young noblewoman. *Simon Tyssot de Patot's Voyages et Aventures de Jacques Massé (1710) features a Lost World. *Simon Tyssot de Patot's La Vie, Les Aventures et Le Voyage de Groenland du Révérend Père Cordelier Pierre de Mésange (1720) features a Hollow Earth. *Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) contains descriptions of alien cultures and \\"weird science\\". *Samuel Madden's Memoirs of the Twentieth Century (1733) in which a narrator from 1728 is given a series of state documents from 1997-1998 by his guardian angel, a plot device which is reminiscent of later time travel novels. However, the story does not explain how the angel obtained these documents. *Ludvig Holberg's Niels Klim's Underground Travels (1741) is an early example of the Hollow Earth genre. *Louis-Sébastien Mercier's L'An 2440 (1771) gives a predictive account of life in the 25th century. *Nicolas-Edmé Restif de la Bretonne's La Découverte Australe par un Homme Volant (1781) features prophetic inventions. *Giacomo Casanova's Icosameron (1788) is a novel that makes use of the Hollow Earth device 19th-century transitions =Shelley and Europe in the early 19th century= Mary Shelley by Richard Rothwell (1840–41) The 19th century saw a major acceleration of these trends and features, most clearly seen in the groundbreaking publication of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein in 1818. The short novel features the archetypal \\"mad scientist\\" experimenting with advanced technology. In his book Billion Year Spree, Brian Aldiss claims Frankenstein represents \\"the first seminal work to which the label SF can be logically attached\\". It is also the first of the \\"mad scientist\\" subgenre. Although normally associated with the gothic horror genre, the novel introduces science fiction themes such as the use of technology for achievements beyond the scope of science at the time, and the alien as antagonist, furnishing a view of the human condition from an outside perspective. Aldiss argues that science fiction in general derives its conventions from the gothic novel. Mary Shelley's short story \\"Roger Dodsworth: The Reanimated Englishman\\" (1826) sees a man frozen in ice revived in the present day, incorporating the now common science fiction theme of cryonics whilst also exemplifying Shelley's use of science as a conceit to drive her stories. Another futuristic Shelley novel, The Last Man, is also often cited as the first true science fiction novel. In 1836 Alexander Veltman published Predki Kalimerosa: Aleksandr Filippovich Makedonskii (The forebears of Kalimeros: Alexander, son of Philip of Macedon), which has been called the first original Russian science fiction novel and the first novel to use time travel.Yury Akutin, Александр Вельтман и его роман \\"Странник\\" (A.V. and his novel Strannik), 1978 (in Russian). In it the narrator rides to ancient Greece on a hippogriff, meets Aristotle, and goes on a voyage with Alexander the Great before returning to the 19th century. Somehow influenced by the scientific theories of 19th century, but most certainly by the idea of human progress, Victor Hugo wrote in The Legend of the Centuries (1859) a long poem in two parts that can be viewed like a dystopia/utopia fiction, called 20th century. It shows in a first scene the body of a broken huge ship, the greatest product of the prideful and foolish mankind that called it Leviathan, wandering in a desert world where the winds blow and the anger of the wounded Nature is; humanity, finally reunited and pacified, has gone toward the stars in a starship, to look for and to bring liberty into the light. Other notable proto-science fiction authors and works of the early 19th century include: * Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville's Le Dernier Homme (1805, The Last Man). * Historian Félix Bodin's Le Roman de l'Avenir (1834) and Emile Souvestre's Le Monde Tel Qu'il Sera (1846), two novels which try to predict what the next century will be like. * Jane C. Loudon's The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty- Second Century (1827), in which Cheops is revived by scientific means into a world in political crisis, where technology has advanced to gas-flame jewelry and houses that migrate on rails, etc. * Louis Geoffroy's Napoleon et la Conquête du Monde (1836), an alternate history of a world conquered by Napoleon. * C.I. Defontenay's Star ou Psi de Cassiopée (1854), an Olaf Stapledon-like chronicle of an alien world and civilization. * Slovak (in that time Hungarian) author Gustáv Reuss's Hviezdoveda alebo životopis Krutohlava, čo na Zemi, okolo Mesiaca a Slnka skúsil a čo o obežniciach, vlasaticiach, pôvode a konci sveta vedel (\\"The Science of the Stars or The Life of Krutohlav who Visited the Moon and the Sun and Knew about Planets, Comets and the Beginning and the End of the World\\" ) (1856). In this book Gustáv Reuss sends his hero named Krutohlav, a scholar from the Gemer region, right to the Moon... in a balloon. When the hero comes back, he builds a sort of a dragon- like interstellar ship, in which the characters travel around the whole known Solar System and eventually visit all the countries of the Earth. * Astronomer Camille Flammarion's La Pluralité des Mondes Habités (1862) which speculated on extraterrestrial life. * Edward Bulwer-Lytton's The Coming Race (1871), a novel where the main character discovers a highly evolved subterranean civilization. PSI-powers are given a logical and scientific explanation, achieved through biological evolution and technological progress, rather than something magical or supernatural. * Edward S. Ellis's The Steam Man of the Prairies 1868 The first novel starts when Ethan Hopkins and Mickey McSquizzle—a \\"Yankee\\" and an \\"Irishman\\"—encounter a colossal, steam-powered man in the American prairies. This steam-man was constructed by Johnny Brainerd, a teenaged boy, who uses the steam-man to carry him in a carriage on various adventures. =Verne and Wells= The European brand of science fiction proper began later in the 19th century with the scientific romances of Jules Verne and the science-oriented, socially critical novels of H. G. Wells. Verne's adventure stories, notably Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), From the Earth to the Moon (1865), and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1869) mixed daring romantic adventure with technology that was either up to the minute or logically extrapolated into the future. They were tremendous commercial successes and established that an author could make a career out of such whimsical material. L. Sprague de Camp calls Verne \\"the world's first full-time science fiction novelist.\\" Wells's stories, on the other hand, use science fiction devices to make didactic points about his society. In The Time Machine (1895), for example, the technical details of the machine are glossed over quickly so that the Time Traveller can tell a story that criticizes the stratification of English society. The story also uses Darwinian evolution (as would be expected in a former student of Darwin's champion, Huxley), and shows an awareness of Marxism. In The War of the Worlds (1898), the Martians' technology is not explained as it would have been in a Verne story, and the story is resolved by a deus ex machina, albeit a scientifically explained one. The differences between Verne and Wells highlight a tension that would exist in science fiction throughout its history. The question of whether to present realistic technology or to focus on characters and ideas has been ever- present, as has the question of whether to tell an exciting story or make a didactic point. = Late 19th-century expansion = Leaving the opera in the year 2000, hand-coloured lithograph by Albert Robida (late 19th century) Wells and Verne had quite a few rivals in early science fiction. Short stories and novelettes with themes of fantastic imagining appeared in journals throughout the late 19th century and many of these employed scientific ideas as the springboard to the imagination. Erewhon is a novel by Samuel Butler published in 1872 and dealing with the concept that machines could one day become sentient and supplant the human race. In 1886 the novel The Future Eve by French author Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam was published, where Thomas Edison builds an artifical woman. Although better known for Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle also wrote early science fiction, particularly using the character of Professor Challenger. Rudyard Kipling's contributions to the genre in the early 1900s made Campbell describe him as \\"the first modern science fiction writer\\". Other writers in the field were Bengali science fiction authors such as Sukumar Ray and Begum Roquia Sakhawat Hussain, who wrote the earliest known feminist science fiction work, Sultana's Dream.Early Bengali science fiction, Amardeep Singh, lehigh.edu Another early feminist science fiction work at the time was Charlotte Perkins Gilman' Herland. Wells and Verne both had an international readership and influenced writers in America, especially. Soon a home-grown American science fiction was thriving. European writers found more readers by selling to the American market and writing in an Americanised style. =American proto-science fiction in the late 19th century= In the last decades of the 19th century, works of science fiction for adults and children were numerous in America, though it was not yet given the name \\"science fiction.\\" There were science-fiction elements in the stories of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Fitz-James O'Brien. Edgar Allan Poe is often mentioned with Verne and Wells as the founders of science fiction. A number of his short stories, and the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket are science fictional. An 1827 satiric novel by philosopher George Tucker A Voyage to the Moon is sometimes cited as the first American science fiction novel. In 1835 Edgar Allan Poe published a short story, \\"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall\\" in which a flight to the moon in a balloon is described. It has an account of the launch, the construction of the cabin, descriptions of strata and many more science-like aspects. In addition to Poe's account the story written in 1813 by the Dutch Willem Bilderdijk is remarkable. In his novel Kort verhaal van eene aanmerkelijke luchtreis en nieuwe planeetontdekking (Short account of a remarkable journey into the skies and discovery of a new planet) Bilderdijk tells of a European somewhat stranded in an Arabic country where he boasts he is able to build a balloon that can lift people and let them fly through the air. The gasses used turn out to be far more powerful than expected and after a while he lands on a planet positioned between earth and moon. The writer uses the story to portray an overview of scientific knowledge concerning the moon in all sorts of aspects the traveller to that place would encounter. Quite a few similarities can be found in the story Poe published some twenty years later. John Leonard Riddell, a Professor of Chemistry in New Orleans, published the short story Orrin Lindsay's plan of aerial navigation, with a narrative of his explorations in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and his wonderful voyage round the moon! in 1847 on a pamphlet. It tells the story of the student Orrin Lindsay who invents an alloy that prevents gravitational attraction, and in a spherical craft leaves earth and travel to the moon. The story contains algebra and scientific footnotes, which makes it an early example of hard science fiction. William Henry Rhodes published in 1871 the tale The Case of Summerfield in the Sacramento Union newspaper, and introduced weapon of mass destruction. A mad scientist and villain called Black Bart makes an attempt to blackmail the world with a powder made of potassium, able to destroy the planet by turning its waters into fire. Charles Curtis Dail, a Kentucky lawyer, published in 1890 the novel Willmoth the Wanderer, or The Man from Saturn, had his protagonist travel through the solar system by covering his body with an anti-gravity ointment.Energizing Futures: How SF Fuels ItselfC.C. Dail The newspaper man Edward Page Mitchell would publish his innovative science fiction short stories in The Sun for more than a decade, except for his first story which was published in Scribner's Monthly in 1874. His stories included invisibility, faster than light travels, teleportation, time travel, cryogenics, mind transfer, mutants, cyborgs and mechanical brains. One of the most successful works of early American science fiction was the second-best selling novel in the U.S. in the 19th century: Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1888), its effects extending far beyond the field of literature. Looking Backward extrapolates a future society based on observation of the current society. In 1894, Will Harben published \\"Land of the Changing Sun,\\" a dystopian fantasy set at the center of the earth. In Harben's tale, the earth's core is populated by a scientifically advanced civilization, living beneath the glow of a mechanical sun. Mark Twain explored themes of science in his novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. By means of \\"transmigration of souls\\", \\"transposition of epochs – and bodies\\" Twain's Yankee is transported back in time and his knowledge of 19th-century technology with him. Written in 1889, A Connecticut Yankee seems to predict the events of World War I, when Europe's old ideas of chivalry in warfare were shattered by new weapons and tactics. American author L. Frank Baum's series of 14 books (1900–1920) based in his outlandish Land of Oz setting, contained depictions of strange weapons (Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, Glinda of Oz), mechanical men (Tik-Tok of Oz) and a bevy of not-yet-realized technological inventions and devices including perhaps the first literary appearance of handheld wireless communicators (Tik-Tok of Oz). Jack London wrote several science fiction stories, including \\"The Red One\\" (a story involving extraterrestrials), The Iron Heel (set in the future from London's point of view) and \\"The Unparalleled Invasion\\" (a story involving future germ warfare and ethnic cleansing). He also wrote a story about invisibility and a story about an irresistible energy weapon. These stories began to change the features of science fiction. Edward Everett Hale wrote The Brick Moon, a Verne-inspired novel notable as the first work to describe an artificial satellite. Written in much the same style as his other work, it employs pseudojournalistic realism to tell an adventure story with little basis in reality. Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) began writing science fiction for pulp magazines just before World War I, getting his first story Under the Moons of Mars published in 1912. He continued to publish adventure stories, many of them science fiction, throughout the rest of his life. The pulps published adventure stories of all kinds. Science fiction stories had to fit in alongside murder mysteries, horror, fantasy and Edgar Rice Burroughs' own Tarzan. Early 20th century The next great science fiction writers after H. G. Wells were Olaf Stapledon (1886–1950), whose four major works Last and First Men (1930), Odd John (1935), Star Maker (1937), and Sirius (1944), introduced a myriad of ideas that writers have since adopted, and J.-H. Rosny aîné, born in Belgium, the father of \\"modern\\" French science fiction, a writer also comparable to H. G. Wells, who wrote the classic Les Xipehuz (1887) and La Mort de la Terre (1910). However, the Twenties and Thirties would see the genre represented in a new format. Robert Hugh Benson wrote one of the first modern dystopias, Lord of the World (1907). Rudyard Kipling's contributions to science fiction go beyond their direct impact at the start of the 20th century. The Aerial Board of Control stories and his critique of the British military, The Army of a Dream, were not only very modern in style, but strongly influenced authors like John W. Campbell and Robert Anson Heinlein, the latter of whom wrote a novel, Starship Troopers, that contains all of the elements of The Army of a Dream, and whose Stranger in a Strange Land can be compared to The Jungle Book, with the human child raised by Martians instead of wolves. Heinlein's technique of indirect exposition first appears in Kiplings' writing. Heinlein, the central influence of all science fiction from the 1930s forward, has also described himself as influenced by George Bernard Shaw, whose longest work Back to Methuselah (1921) was itself science fiction. =Birth of the pulps= The development of American science fiction as a self-conscious genre dates in part from 1926, when Hugo Gernsback founded Amazing Stories magazine, which was devoted exclusively to science fiction stories. Though science fiction magazines had been published in Sweden and Germany before, Amazing Stories was the first English language magazine to solely publish science fiction. Since he is notable for having chosen the variant term scientifiction to describe this incipient genre, the stage in the genre's development, his name and the term \\"scientifiction\\" are often thought to be inextricably linked. Though Gernsback encouraged stories featuring scientific realism to educate his readers about scientific principles, such stories shared the pages with exciting stories with little basis in reality. Much of what Gernsback published was referred to as \\"gadget fiction\\", about what happens when someone makes a technological invention. Published in this and other pulp magazines with great and growing success, such scientifiction stories were not viewed as serious literature but as sensationalism. Nevertheless, a magazine devoted entirely to science fiction was a great boost to the public awareness of the scientific speculation story. Amazing Stories competed with several other pulp magazines, including Weird Tales (which primarily published fantasy stories), Astounding Stories, and Wonder Stories, throughout the 1930s. It was in the Gernsback era that science fiction fandom arose through the medium of the \\"Letters to the Editor\\" columns of Amazing and its competitors. In August 1928, Amazing Stories published Skylark of Space and Armageddon 2419 A.D., while Weird Tales published Edmond Hamilton's Crashing Suns, all of which represented the birth of space opera. Fritz Lang's movie Metropolis (1927), in which the first cinematic humanoid robot was seen, and the Italian Futurists' love of machines are indicative of both the hopes and fears of the world between the world wars. Metropolis was an extremely successful film and its art-deco inspired aesthetic became the guiding aesthetic of the science fiction pulps for some time. =Modernist writing= Writers attempted to respond to the new world in the post-World War I era. In the 1920s and 30s writers entirely unconnected with science fiction were exploring new ways of telling a story and new ways of treating time, space and experience in the narrative form. The posthumously published works of Franz Kafka (who died in 1924) and the works of modernist writers such as James Joyce, T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf and others featured stories in which time and individual identity could be expanded, contracted, looped and otherwise distorted. While this work was unconnected to science fiction as a genre, it did deal with the impact of modernity (technology, science, and change) upon people's lives, and decades later, during the New Wave movement, some modernist literary techniques entered science fiction. Czech playwright Karel Čapek's plays The Makropulos Affair, R.U.R., The Life of the Insects, and the novel War with the Newts were modernist literature which invented important science fiction motifs. R.U.R. in particular is noted for introducing the word robot to the world's vocabulary. A strong theme in modernist writing was alienation, the making strange of familiar surroundings so that settings and behaviour usually regarded as \\"normal\\" are seen as though they were the seemingly bizarre practices of an alien culture. The audience of modernist plays or the readership of modern novels is often led to question everything. At the same time, a tradition of more literary science fiction novels, treating with a dissonance between perceived Utopian conditions and the full expression of human desires, began to develop: the dystopian novel. For some time, the science fictional elements of these works were ignored by mainstream literary critics, though they owe a much greater debt to the science fiction genre than the modernists do. Sincerely Utopian writing, including much of Wells, has also deeply influenced science fiction, beginning with Hugo Gernsback's Ralph 124C 41+. Yevgeny Zamyatin's 1920 novel We depicts a totalitarian attempt to create a utopia that results in a dystopic state where free will is lost. Aldous Huxley bridged the gap between the literary establishment and the world of science fiction with Brave New World (1932), an ironic portrait of a stable and ostensibly happy society built by human mastery of genetic manipulation. In the late 1930s, John W. Campbell became editor of Astounding Science Fiction, and a critical mass of new writers emerged in New York City in a group of science fiction fans (many of whom soon became professional writers) called the Futurians, which included Isaac Asimov, Damon Knight, Donald A. Wollheim, Frederik Pohl, James Blish, Judith Merril, and others. Other important writers during this period included Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and A. E. van Vogt. Campbell's tenure at Astounding is considered to be the beginning of the Golden Age of science fiction, characterized by hard science fiction stories celebrating scientific achievement and progress. This lasted until postwar technological advances, new magazines like Galaxy under H.L. Gold and later Pohl as editor, and a new generation of writers began writing stories outside the Campbell mode. George Orwell wrote perhaps the most highly regarded of these literary dystopias, Nineteen Eighty-Four, in 1948. He envisions a technologically governed totalitarian regime that dominates society through total information control. Zamyatin's We is recognized as an influence on both Huxley and Orwell; Orwell published a book review of We shortly after it was first published in English, several years before writing 1984. Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed:An Ambiguous Utopia, much of Kurt Vonnegut's writing, and many other works of later science fiction continue this dialogue between utopia and dystopia. =Science fiction's impact on the public= Orson Welles's The Mercury Theatre on the Air produced a radio version of The War of the Worlds which, according to urban myth, panicked large numbers of people who believed the program to be a real newscast. However, there is doubt as to how much anecdotes of mass panic had any reflection in reality, and the myth may have originated among newspapers, jealous of the upstart new medium of radio.https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/war-of-the-worlds/ Inarguably, though, the idea of visitors or invaders from outer space became embedded in the consciousness of everyday people. During World War II, American military planners studied science fiction for ideas. The British did the same, and also asked authors to submit outlandish ideas which the government leaked to the Axis as real plans. Pilots speculated as to the origins of the \\"Foo fighters\\" they saw around them in the air. Meanwhile, the Germans had developed flying bombs known as V1s and V2s reminiscent of the \\"rocket ships\\" ever-present in pulp science fiction, presaging space flight. Jet planes and the atom bomb were developed. \\"Deadline\\", a Cleve Cartmill short story about a fictional atomic bomb project prompted the FBI to visit the offices of Astounding Science Fiction. Asimov said that \\"The dropping of the atom bomb in 1945 made science fiction respectable. Once the horror at Hiroshima took place, anyone could see that science fiction writers were not merely dreamers and crackpots after all, and that many of the motifs of that class of literature were now permanently part of the newspaper headlines\\". With the story of a flying saucer crash in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, science fiction had become modern folklore. The Golden Age The period of the 1940s and 1950s is often referred to as the Golden Age of Science Fiction. =Astounding Magazine= With the emergence in 1937 of a demanding editor, John W. Campbell, Jr., at Astounding Science Fiction, and with the publication of stories and novels by such writers as Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Robert A. Heinlein, science fiction began to gain status as serious fiction. Campbell exercised an extraordinary influence over the work of his stable of writers, thus shaping the direction of science fiction. Asimov wrote, \\"We were extensions of himself; we were his literary clones.\\" Under Campbell's direction, the years from 1938-1950 would become known as the \\"Golden Age of science fiction\\", though Asimov points out that the term Golden Age has been used more loosely to refer to other periods in science fiction's history. Campbell's guidance to his writers included his famous dictum, \\"Write me a creature that thinks as well as a man, or better than a man, but not like a man.\\" He emphasized a higher quality of writing than editors before him, giving special attention to developing the group of young writers who attached themselves to him. Ventures into the genre by writers who were not devoted exclusively to science fiction also added respectability. Magazine covers of bug-eyed monsters and scantily clad women, however, preserved the image of a sensational genre appealing only to adolescents. There was a public desire for sensation, a desire of people to be taken out of their dull lives to the worlds of space travel and adventure. An interesting footnote to Campbell's regime is his contribution to the rise of L. Ron Hubbard's religion Scientology. Hubbard was considered a promising science fiction writer and a protégé of Campbell, who published Hubbard's first articles about Dianetics and his new religion. As Campbell's reign as editor of Astounding progressed, Campbell gave more attention to ideas like Hubbard's, writing editorials in support of Dianetics. Though Astounding continued to have a loyal fanbase, readers started turning to other magazines to find science fiction stories. =The Golden Age in other media= With the new source material provided by the Golden Age writers, advances in special effects, and a public desire for material that treated with the advances in technology of the time, all the elements were in place to create significant works of science fiction film. As a result, science fiction film came into its own in the 1950s, producing films like Destination Moon, Them!, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Forbidden Planet, and many others. Many of these movies were based on stories by Campbell's writers. The Thing from Another World was adapted from a Campbell story, Them and Invasion of the Body Snatchers were based on Jack Finney novels, Destination Moon on a Heinlein novel, and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms was derived from a Ray Bradbury short story. John Wyndham's cosy catastrophes, including The Day of the Triffids and The Kraken Wakes, provided important source material as well. Science fiction had also been appearing in American comic books such as Planet Comics, but an important step forward came with the anthology series Weird Science (comic) and Weird Fantasy, published by E.C. Comics, which would include some adaptations from authors like Ray Bradbury, along with many original stories. Classics Illustrated had already published adaptations of Wells and Verne stories. At the same time, science fiction began to appear on a new medium – television. In 1953 The Quatermass Experiment was shown on British television, the first significant science fiction show, though it could also be described as horror. In the United States, science fiction heroes like Captain Video, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers were shown, programs that more closely resembled pre- Campbellian science fiction. These shows also saw comic book spin-off products. =End of the Golden Age= Seeking greater freedom of expression, writers started to publish their articles in other magazines, including The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, If magazine, a resurrected Amazing Stories, and most notably, Galaxy. Under editors H.L. Gold and then Frederik Pohl, Galaxy stressed a more literary form of science fiction that took cues from more mainstream literature. It was less insistent on scientific plausibility than Campbell's Astounding. The rise of Galaxy signaled the end of Golden Age science fiction, though most of the Golden Age writers were able to adapt to the changes in the genre and keep writing. Some, however, moved to other fields. Isaac Asimov and several others began to write scientific fact almost exclusively. The New Wave and its aftermath =Mainstream publishers= Until about 1950, magazines were the only way authors could publish new stories. Only small specialty presses like Arkham House and Gnome Press published science fiction hardcover books, all reprints of magazine stories. With rare exceptions like the collections Adventures in Time and Space and A Treasury of Science Fiction, large mainstream publishers only printed Verne and Wells. Most genre books were sold by mail from small magazine advertisements, because bookstores rarely carried science fiction. By 1951, the small presses proved that demand existed for science fiction books, enough to cause magazines to print regular review columns. Large, mainstream companies published hardboiled crime fiction during World War II; Doubleday in 1950, then Simon & Schuster, Scribner's, Putnam, and others now entered the science fiction market. They issued fixups such as The Martian Chronicles, novel versions of serialized stories, and original fiction. Demand for content grew as the specialty presses had depleted the supply of easily reprinted, high-quality stories; new genre magazines appeared (38 different science fiction publications existed in the US and UK in 1953); and large-circulation magazines like Playboy, Collier's, and Esquire published stories. Genre stories like Walter M. Miller Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz became mainstream bestsellers as books. For the first time, an author could write science fiction full-time; Barry N. Malzberg calculated that producing 1,000 words a day would earn twice the national median income, and Asimov stopped teaching at Boston University School of Medicine after making more money as a writer. The mainstream book companies' large print runs and distribution networks lowered prices and increased availability, but displaced the small publishers; Algis Budrys later said that \\"they themselves would draw little but disaster\\" from the science fiction boom of the 1950s they helped to begin. While book sales continued to grow, the magazine industry almost collapsed from the glut of new titles, shrinking from 23 in mid-1957 to six by the end of 1960, while authors like Heinlein, Clarke, Vonnegut, and Bradbury published through non- genre publications that paid at much higher rates. Top writers like Budrys, Miller, Theodore Sturgeon, and Robert Silverberg left the industry. =Precursors to the New Wave= Samuel Beckett's The Unnamable and Waiting for Godot were influential upon writing in the 1950s. In the former all sense of place and time are dispensed with; all that remains is a voice poised between the urge to continue existing and the urge to find silence and oblivion. (The only other major writer to use \\"The Unnamable\\" as a title was H. P. Lovecraft.) In the latter, time and the paradoxes of cause and effect become thematic. Beckett's influence on the intelligentsia—as well as the general influence of existentialism and the legal battles to publish books then classified as obscene—made science fiction more sophisticated, especially in Britain. William S. Burroughs (1914-1997) was the writer who finally brought science fiction together with the trends of postmodern literature. With the help of Jack Kerouac, Burroughs published Naked Lunch, the first of a series of novels employing a semi-dadaistic technique called the Cut-up and postmodern deconstructions of conventional society, pulling away the mask of normality to reveal nothingness beneath. Burroughs showed visions of society as a conspiracy of aliens, monsters, police states, drug dealers and alternate levels of reality. The linguistics of science fiction merged with the experiments of postmodernism in a beat generation gestalt. =The New Wave= In 1960, British novelist Kingsley Amis published New Maps of Hell, a literary history and examination of the field of science fiction. This serious attention from a mainstream, acceptable writer did a great deal of good, eventually, for the reputation of science fiction. Another milestone was the publication, in 1965, of Frank Herbert's Dune, a complex work of fiction featuring political intrigue in a future galaxy, mystical religious beliefs, and the ecosystem of the desert planet Arrakis. Another was the emergence of the work of Roger Zelazny, whose novels such as Lord of Light and his famous The Chronicles of Amber showed that the lines between science-fiction, fantasy, religion, and social commentary could be very fine. Also in 1965 French director Jean-Luc Godard's film Alphaville used the medium of dystopian and apocalyptic science fiction to explore language and society. In Britain, the 1960s generation of writers, dubbed \\"The New Wave\\", were experimenting with different forms of science fiction, stretching the genre towards surrealism, psychological drama and mainstream currents. The 60s New Wave was centred around the writing in the magazine New Worlds after Michael Moorcock assumed editorial control in 1963. William Burroughs was a big influence. The writers of the New Wave also believed themselves to be building on the legacy of the French New Wave artistic movement. Though the New Wave was largely a British movement, there were parallel developments taking place in American science fiction at the same time. The relation of the British New Wave to American science fiction was made clear by Harlan Ellison's original anthology Dangerous Visions, which presented science fiction writers, both American and British, writing stories that pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in a science fiction magazine. Isaac Asimov, writing an introduction to the anthology, labeled it the Second Revolution, after the first revolution that produced the Golden Age. The New Wave and their contemporaries placed a greater emphasis on style and a more highbrow form of storytelling. They also sought controversy in subjects older science fiction writers had avoided. For the first time sexuality, which Kingsley Amis had complained was nearly ignored in science fiction, was given serious consideration by writers like Samuel R. Delany, Ursula K. Le Guin, Norman Spinrad, and Theodore Sturgeon. Contemporary political issues were also given voice, as John Brunner and J.G. Ballard wrote cautionary tales about, respectively, overpopulation and apocalypse. Asimov noted that the Second Revolution was far less clear cut than the first, attributing this to the development of the anthology, which made older stories more prominent. But a number of Golden Age writers changed their style as the New Wave hit. Robert A. Heinlein switched from his Campbellian Future History stories to stylistically adventuresome, sexually open works of fiction, notably Stranger in a Strange Land and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. Isaac Asimov wrote the New Wave-ish The Gods Themselves. Many others also continued successfully as styles changed. Science fiction films took inspiration from the changes in the genre. Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange gave visual form to the genre's new style. A myriad of other films, including THX 1138 and Soylent Green, depicted a dystopian future. Ursula K. Le Guin extrapolated social and biological changes that were anthropological in nature. Philip K. Dick explored the metaphysics of the mind in a series of novels and stories that rarely seemed dependent on their science fictional content. Le Guin, Dick, and others like them became associated with the concept of soft science fiction more than with the New Wave. Soft science fiction was contrasted to the notion of hard science fiction. Though scientific plausibility had been a central tenet of the genre since Gernsback, writers like Larry Niven and Poul Anderson gave hard science fiction new life, crafting stories with a more sophisticated writing style and more deeply characterized protagonists, while preserving a high level of scientific sophistication. Science fiction in the 1980s =Cyberpunk= By the early 1980s the fantasy market was much larger than that of almost all science fiction authors. The New Wave had faded out as an important presence in the science fiction landscape. As new personal computing technologies became an integral part of society, science fiction writers felt the urge to make statements about its influence on the cultural and political landscape. Drawing on the work of the New Wave, the Cyberpunk movement developed in the early 80s. Though it placed the same influence on style that the New Wave did, it developed its own unique style, typically focusing on the 'punks' of their imagined future underworld. Cyberpunk authors like William Gibson turned away from the traditional optimism and support for progress of traditional science fiction. William Gibson's Neuromancer, published in 1984, announced the cyberpunk movement to the larger literary world and was a tremendous commercial success. Other key writers in the movement included Bruce Sterling, John Shirley, and later Neal Stephenson. Though Cyberpunk would later be cross-pollinated with other styles of science fiction, there seemed to be some notion of ideological purity in the beginning. John Shirley compared the Cyberpunk movement to a tribe.Cadigan, Pat. The Ultimate Cyberpunk iBooks, 2002. During the 1980s, a large number of cyberpunk manga and anime works were produced in Japan, the most notable being the 1982 manga Akira and its 1988 anime film adaptation, the 1985 anime Megazone 23, and the 1989 manga Ghost in the Shell which was also adapted into an anime film in 1995. Contemporary science fiction and its future Contemporary science fiction has been marked by the spread of cyberpunk to other parts of the marketplace of ideas. No longer is cyberpunk a ghettoized tribe within science fiction, but an integral part of the field whose interactions with other parts have been the primary theme of science fiction around the start of the 21st century. Notably, cyberpunk has influenced film, in works such as Johnny Mnemonic and The Matrix series, in anime such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell, and the emerging medium of video games, with the critically acclaimed Deus Ex and Metal Gear series. This entrance of cyberpunk into mainstream culture has led to the introduction of cyberpunk's stylistic motifs to the masses, particularly the cyberpunk fashion style. It has also led to other developments including Steampunk (a subgenre of science fiction and fantasy that incorporates technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery) and Dieselpunk (which combines the aesthetics of the diesel-based technology of the interwar period through to the 1950s with retro-futuristic technology and postmodern sensibilities). Emerging themes in the 1990s included environmental issues, the implications of the global Internet and the expanding information universe, questions about biotechnology and nanotechnology, as well as a post-Cold War interest in post- scarcity societies; Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age comprehensively explores these themes. Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan novels brought the character- driven story back into prominence. The cyberpunk reliance on near-future science fiction has deepened. In William Gibson's 2003 novel, Pattern Recognition, the story is a cyberpunk story told in the present, the ultimate limit of the near-future extrapolation. Cyberpunk's ideas have spread in other directions, though. Space opera writers have written work featuring cyberpunk motifs, including David Brin's Kiln People and Ken MacLeod's Fall Revolution series. This merging of the two disparate threads of science fiction in the 1980s has produced an extrapolational literature in contrast to those technological stories told in the present. John Clute writes that science fiction around the start of the 21st century can be understood in two ways: \\"a vision of the triumph of science fiction as a genre and as a series of outstanding texts which figured to our gaze the significant futures that, during those years, came to pass ... [or]... indecipherable from the world during those years ... fatally indistinguishable from the world it attempted to adumbrate, to signify.\\" See also * Speculative fiction (section History, section Emergent distinction from Science Fiction and pre-existing genre schema) * Science fiction film (section History) * History of science fiction films * Science fiction magazine (section History of science fiction magazines) * List of science fiction visual artists (redirect from Science fiction art) * Science fiction fandom (section Origins and history) * Russian science fiction and fantasy which is arranged by chronological sections * Science fiction in China which is arranged by chronological sections * Serbian science fiction (section History) *History of interstellar space * Timeline of science fiction References Further reading * Aldiss, Brian, and David Hargrove.

The barracks were constructed between the 1840s and 1874,The Geographical Information System on Hong Kong Heritage and situated within the area bounded by Cotton Tree Drive, Kennedy Road and Queensway, Hong Kong. Together with Murray Barracks, Wellington Barracks and Admiralty Dock, the barracks formed a British military zone in Central. The barracks was named for Queen Victoria, monarch at the time of construction. History Victoria Barracks in 1971 The barracks were one of the first British military compounds in Hong Kong and were used by the Japanese during the Japanese occupation (1941–1945). They underwent major restoration after World War II. Part of the land was returned to the Hong Kong Government in 1967;D H Oxley. (1979)Victoria Barracks, 1842–1979.

The planning of the redevelopment of the Victoria Barracks had led to the strong public pressure in the late 1970s. According to the Report, the Royal Town Planning Institute and the Hong Kong Heritage Society objected to the setting up of the ad hoc committee, separate from the Town Planning Board. In the report, the committee suggested that the public supported the preservation of the mature trees and the green zones, including the wooded slopes, in the barracks; also, it was suggested that Flagstaff House and other historic buildings should be preserved. The Hong Kong Squash Racquets Association supported the retention of the historic squash court building, which was later demolished during the redevelopment and replaced by a new one. The Scout Association of Hong Kong requested to be allocated some of the buildings and structures to set up a scout training centre. Some people proposed that the government should re-site the proposed new secondary school, the government offices and the then Supreme Court (now the High Court). In 1979, the Government released the final planning proposal; the Urban Council, the Conservancy Association and the Hong Kong Heritage Society were dissatisfied that the Government refused to preserve the whole site of the barracks.Govt Relents On Barracks by Michael Chugani, Hong Kong Standard, 11 Jul 1978 Part of the site was converted to the Hong Kong Park while the southern part of the barracks was where Pacific Place, the High Court and Queensway Government Offices now stand.

The district covers 8,380 km2. It is bound on the north by Rewari district of Haryana, on the east by Bharatpur district of Rajasthan and Nuh district of Haryana, on the south by Dausa district, and on the west by Jaipur district. As of 2011 it is the third most populous district of Rajasthan (out of 33) after Jaipur and Jodhpur.  Topography  The district is a fairly regular quadrilateral in shape with its central northern portion consisting of tahsil Mandawar hemmed in by the protruding north of tahsil Behror on the west and tahsil Tijara on the east and its south eastern corner consisting of Lachhmangarh tahsil slightly flapping outward into Bharatpur district. Ridges of rocky and precipitous hills, for the most part parallel, are a feature observable throughout the whole district which, however, is generally open to the north and east. The conspicuous feature of the district is the Aravalli range. It may be said that the hills decrease in height and breadth from south to north and west to east. The northern and some portion of the western part of the district have shifting sand dunes. There is no river in the district which is perennial on its entire course. Ruparel, Sabi, Chuhar Sidh and Landoha are the only rivers which flow through the district and carry the drainage of the hills. There is no natural lake in the district. However, there are about many artificial lakes and tanks. The history of some of these can be traced to as far back as the second century A.D. Baghola Bund (tank) near Rajgarh. Some of the bunds like were constructed during the time of Mughals when Alwar forest was considered to be a haunt of wild animals and the fovourite Shikar Gah of the Mughal Emperors. Later on, Maharajas of the Alwar Stale built many bunds.  Climate  The district has a dry climate with a hot summer, a cold winter and a short monsoon season. The cold season starts by about the middle of November and continues up to about the beginning of March.  History  = Ancient period = Archaeological excavations at different places in the area have given inkling of the presence of hand-axe culture in the district. The close proximity of the district to Bairath, the old Virata, lends it an antiquity of epic age. Mention is found in the Mahabharata of the Pandavas who spent the thirteenth year of their exile incognito at Virata. The region was historically known as Matsya. The Matsyas appear in connection with the Vasas (or Vatsas) in the Kaushitaki Upanishad and with the Salvas in the Gopatha Brahmana. Dhvasan Dvaitavana (mentioned in Shatapatha Brahmana) is said to have performed a horse sacrifice (Ashwamedh Yajna) and probably ruled in or about Jaipur or Alwar. According to the Manusmriti, the Matsyas were included in the Brahmarshidesha and ‘they appear as one of the select few of the Aryan races who were noted for their devotion to Brahmanical ideals’. The territory around Bairath was included in the Maurayan empire is evidenced by the discovery of the Minor Rock Edict I and Bhabra Edict of Ashoka at this place. The disintegration of Mauryan empire was followed by the invasions of the foreigners and evolution of small principalities. The numismatic material excavated at Bairath is a clear indication that the Indo-Greek rule. The tribal republic that emerged around this area after the fall of Pushyamitra and end of Greek invasion about the closing years of the first century B. C., was that of Arjunayanas and Yaudheyas. About the end of the first century B.C., the Arjunayanas were subdued by the Sakas. After the decline of Kushanas, the Arjunayanas recovered their independence but had to submit to the suzerainty of the Guptas about the middle of the fourth century. They were one of the nine tribal states subjugated by Samudragupta “who paid taxes, obeyed orders and performed obeisance in person to the great power”. The Pratiharas who came into prominence about the second half of the sixth century A. D., took advantage of the tottering Gupta empire and established their hold in the heart of Rajputana. Throughout the later period of Pratihara rule, there was a triangular contest between the Pratiharas, the Palas and Rashtrakutas for supremacy in Northern India. Nagabhata I, the Pratihara king in the second quarter of eighth century A. D., successfully resisted the Arab invasions and augmented his territories. The Gwalior Inscription tells us that Matsya was seized by Nagabhata II. Nagbhata II was succeeded by Ramabhadra and the later by Bhoja. Bhoja ruled for more than 46 years and consolidated a mighty empire in Northern India. An inscription dated 960 A. D. discovered at Rajorgarh (near modern Rajgarh, Alwar) records an order issued by the Maharajadhiraja, Parameshvara, the illustrious Mathanadeva of the Gurjara- Pratihara (Bargujar Rajputs) lineage residing at Rajyapura (i.e. Rajor). Here he invoked the name of the Pratihara Emperor Vijayapaladeva as his suzerain, yet he ruled as a de-facto independent king. In 1009 A.D. Mahmud of Ghazni led an army against the king of Narayan, a place now identified by Cunningham as Narayanpur in the district. The king fought bravely in defence of his country but was defeated. The Sultan smashed the idols and returned to Ghazni with the booty. Meanwhile, Tomaras and Chauhans were the two rising powers to be reckoned with. The areas covered by Rewari and Bhiwani and parts of Alwar district, were then, included in the Bhadanaka kingdom. The Kharataragachchhapattavali of Jinapala (died V. 1295) mentions the defeat of the Bhadanakas as the chief achievement of Prithiviraj III up to the Vikram year 1239. The overthrow of the Bhadanakas by the Chauhans seems to have been decisive. However, the Chauhan authority was impaired considerably after the second battle of Tarain in 1192 A.D. Thereafter, the hold of the Chauhans over this area (Alwar) slackened and the territory was retained for quite some time by the Sultans of Delhi. = Medieval period = According to the tradition, a Jadon dynasty throve in the area now comprising the Bharatpur and Mathura districts. The Tajul-Maasir records that in A. D. 1196 Muizuddin Muhammad Ghori defeated Kunwarpala, the Jadon rai of Tahangarh (a fort about 14 miles south of Bayana). After this debacle, the lords of the Yaduvanshi (Jadon- Bhatti) Rajputs left that area and got scattered in the Mewat region, also at Kaman, Tijara and Sarhatta of Alwar. The descendants of Prithviraj of Ajmer had already settled in (about 1070 A. D.) the area known as Rath (north-west region of the Alwar district) and the raja of Nimrana claims to represent the family of that great Hindu emperor.  Delhi Sultanate  Shamsuddin Altamash, the Sultan of Delhi started his compaigns in Rajputana about 1226 and invaded Ranthambor and attained some success in Bayana, Thangir and Mewat. After his death in 1236 A. D., a concerted effort was made by the dispossessed Chauhans to regain the lost territories under the leadership of Bhagawata. Soon, Chauhan supremacy seems to have prevailed even on Mewat, thus ample opportunity to the turbulent Rajputs to regain their lost power and present a serious menace to the Delhi authority. Balban marched in 1248 A.D. to curb the growing power of the Chauhans but attained little success. Jadon Bhatti Rajputs of Bayana (progenitors of Khanzadas) who had settled in Mewat coalesced with the Chauhans and other Rajput dynasties and commenced offensive guerilla war, sometimes even into the Delhi territory itself. After his ascendancy to the throne and consolidating his conquests, Balban paid serious attention to the raids of the Mewatis. He therefore, cleared the forest in the vicinity of the capital and built a fortress. The capital was thereby cordoned off and freed from the Mewati robbers, and for the first time in several years, the citizens breathed freely. Throughout the 13th century, the whole of Mewat was held by Hindu Jadon Bhattis. For a hundred years, any significant trouble given by the Mewatis to the Sultans of Delhi is not heard.The relations between the Sultan and the Mewatis, by then were cordial. After the death of Sultan Firoz Shah Tughluq of Delhi, Bahadur Nahar, a Khanzada chief of Mewat is heard of gaining prestige, power and favour at the Delhi court. His stronghold was Kotila, in the Tijara hills. He played important role in wars of succession between Abu Bakr and Muhammad Shah.  Mughal Empire and Hemu  After his victory at Panipat, Babur had settled himself at Agra. Hasan Khan Mewati joined the powerful confederacy with 12,000 horses, which was organised by Rana Sanga against Babur, The forces marched to Khanwa and Hasan Khan was among those who were slain in the battle that ensued (1527). After his victory over Rana Sanga, Babar marched towards Mewat to reduce it and entered Alwar on April 7, 1527. Hasan Khan's son, Nahar Khan, arrived begging for pardon and was bestowed a ‘pargana’ by Babur for his support. He bestowed the city of Tijara on Chin Timur Sultan who had fought in the battle of Khanwa on the right flank of Babar's army. Fardi Khan, his another follower, was given the charge of the Alwar fort. Babur himself visited and examined the fort, where he spent a night. After the death of Shershah, his son Jalal Khan was enthroned under the title of Islam Shah. Hemu who was responsible to enthrone Adil Shah at Delhi after the death of Islam Shah in 1552. Hemu was a native of Macheri in Alwar district and is said to be a hawker of salt petre in the streets of Rewari, but rose to the status of prime-minister of Muhammad Shah Adil Sur (1554-1557) by his intelligence, loyalty and great qualities of leadership. He fought and won twenty-two battles against his master's rivals. Gradually he became the de facto ruler of Sur kingdom as his master sank into sloth and obscurity. He fought successfully a battle against the Mughal governor of Delhi, and occupied the city, and proclaimed himself as an independent ruler. He distributed the spoil among the Afghans and thus won them over to his side. He assumed for himself the title of Vikramaditya, but an arrow accidentally struck his eye and pierced his brain in the battle of Panipat (1556). He lay unconscious and was brought before the young emperor Akbar, who gave a blow of sword to Hemu, and Bairam Khan finished him off. Hemu's head was sent to Kabul and his trunk to Delhi to be placed on a gibbet. Soon, forces were sent to strongly defended forts of Deoti and Macheri (now in Rajgarh, Alwar district) where Hemu's wife and his father had taken shelter with their precious goods and treasures. After some resistance, Hemu's father was captured and his conversion to Islam attempted. But he declined and said, “For eighty years I have worshipped my God according to this (Hindu) religion why should I change it at this time, and why should I, merely from fear of my life, and without understanding it, come into way of your worship\\". At this, he was put to death. Hemu's widow, however, escaped with elephants and treasures to the jungles. She was pursued and a part of treasure was recovered from her. Khanzadas of Mewat reconciled with the Delhi rulers by matrimonial alliances. Humayun had married the elder daughter of Jamal Khan, nephew of Hasan Khan Mewati. The Khanzadas became distinguished soldiers in the Imperial army. During the reign of Akbar, Mewat was divided into two Sarkars or districts-Tijara and Alwar, in subah of Agra. Akbar while on his way to Fatehpur Sikri in 1579 visited Alwar and local traditions attribute to him the butchering of Malliks (probably Hindu converts) at Mungana (a few miles south of Alwar town on National Highway No. 8 towards Jaipur) and renaming this village as Akbarpur. Alwar formed a very important base for the launching of attacks by the Mughals on the fort of Ranthambor. It was also an important halting station between Agra and Ajmer. But the turbulent people of Mewat continued their plunderings of the imperial government and even a strong ruler like Akbar could not completely subdue them. Akbar bestowed the jagir of Mewat on his Khanzada brother-in-law Sharffuddin Hussain. Sensing his rebellious attitude, Jahangir appointed Nawab Mubarij Khan as governor of Mewat. In 1661 A.D. (1058 A.H.), Alwar was bestowed as a jagir on Khalilulla Khan and some time later, Aurangzeb gave this tract to Mirza Jai Singh of Amber. However, looking to the growing influence of Mirza and the strategic position of the fort, Aurangzeb took the fort back and bestowed it on Abdul Rahim in 1077 A.H.  Petty Chieftainships  An inscription dating Samvat 1426 and 1439 found at Macheri attests that Rajgarh, Macheri and Devati (Deoti) villages were the possessions of the Badgujar Rajputs who were bound by matrimonial alliances with the rulers of Amber. Ashokmal or Ishwarmal who was the son of Raja Kumbh, refused to send dola to Akbar and also had quarrels with Raja Man Singh of Amber. Thereupon, a combined force of Raja Man Singh and the Delhi emperor, was dispatched against him and he was dispossessed of Devati and Rajorgarh. Kyaranagari in Thanaghazi was the capital of Mewal Meenas whose ruler was Mokalsi at the time of Akbar's reign. The imperial forces plundered Kyara and in its place founded Mohamadabad. About the Samvat 1656 (1599 A. D.) Madho Singh, the second son of Maharaja Bhagwandas of Amber, established a chiefship at Bhangarh and made it his capital. In Samvat 1777 (1720 A.D.), Sawai Man Singh of Jaipur attacked Bhangarh, and incorporated the territory in his kingdom. Madan Singh, commonly known as Rao Made Chauhan, had founded the village Madanpur now known as Mandawar. In course of time, Barrod was also acquired by his descendents. Firoz Shah had forced Rao Jhama (son of Rao Hasa) to embrace Islam but the latter preferred death. However, Rao Chaand, son of Rao Jhama is said to have embraced Islam in Samvat 1499 (1442 A.D.). Thereupon, as a protest, Rajdeo who was the uncle of Chaand, abandoned Mandawar and chose Nimrana as the capital of his chiefship. The descendants of Rao Chaand extended their hold up to Bansur. But they were expelled in Samvat 1560 (1503 A.D.) from Bansur by the Shekhawats of whom Rao Shekhaji, Rao Sujaji and Rao Jagmal were most significant. Rao Sujaji made Basai as his capital whereas Jagmal established himself at Hazipur. After the death of Sujaji in Samvat 1594 (1537 A.D.) his sons Lunkaran, Raimal, Chaand and Bheruji extended their hold up to Khetri, Sikar, Khandela and Shahpura. After the death of Aurangzeb, internal dissensions encouraged the petty chieftains to acquire power. Maharaja Surajrmal of Bharatpur conquered the Alwar fort and some of the adjacent territory. But his son Jawahar Singh, after being defeated by the Jaipur ruler at the battle of Maonda-Mandoli and lost the territory gained by his father. Marathas occupied Tijara and Kishangarh. In 1775 A.D. Pratap Singh of Naruka family acquired Alwar fort and founded the State of Alwar. = Alwar State =  Narukas  Naruka is a subclan of Kachchhwaha Rajputs, who claim descent from Kusha, the eldest son of Rama. They are said to have migrated from Ayodhya to Amber, where Rao Udai Karan (1367 A.D.) had his son Nar Singh. Bar Singh who is said to be his eldest son, gave up his right of succession in favour of his brother Nar Singh. Bar Singh received the estates of Jhak and Mauzabad towns, a few miles south-west of Jaipur. His grandson was Naru who founded the Naru subclan. One of his descendants Rao Kalyan Singh lost his ancestral estate for his loyalty to his chief, Jai Singh and received in lieu of it, Macheri in 1639 A.D. which had been taken from Badgujars.  Maharao Raja Pratap Singh (1740-1791)  Later, Pratap Singh was the son of Muhabbat Singh of Macheri. He was born in 1740 A.D. Sensing a danger to his life in Jaipur, he left for Rajgarh. From there, he went to Jawahar Singh of Bharatpur who bestowed on him a jagir. In 1768, Jawahar Singh insulted the Jaipur Chief by marching without intimation of his motive, through his Stale, to visit the holy lake of Pushkar near Ajmer. On his return journey, he was attacked by the Rajputs and was defeated at Maonda-Mandholi in the Tanwarati hills, north of Jaipur. “The victory was, in a great measure, due to the transfer by Pratap Singh of his supporters to the side of his liegelord on the eve of the battle.\\" As a result, Pratap was restored to his fief of Macheri and was also allowed to build a fort at Rajgarh. Pratap Singh gained great influence at the Jaipur court. At this time Najaf Khan, the imperial commander aided by Marathas, proceeded to expel Jats from Agra and Bharatpur. Pratap Singh aligned himself with Najaf Khan and aided him in defeating the Jats, \\"This aid in defeating the Jats, obtained for him the title of Rao Raja and a Sanad for Macheri, to hold direct of the crown.” Pratap Singh found an opportunity of reducing the fortress of Alwar which then belonged to the Jat princes of Bharatpur and seized it. He entered the fort of Alwar in November 1775. The followers of Pratap Singh began to own him as their feudal lord as soon as the Alwar fort was taken. He died on September 26, 1791 A.D.  Maharao Raja Sawai Bakhtawar Singh (1791-1815)  Pratap Singh left no sons to succeed him. He had adopted Bakhtawar Singh of Thana (near Rajgarh, Alwar), younger son of Dhir Singh. When Bakhtawar Singh occupied lands of other chiefs and strengthened his position by allying himself with the British Government. To checkmate the menacing power of the Marathas, he coalesced his troops with those of British Commander-in-Chief, Lord Lake in the battle of Laswari, a small village in the district. Mahharaja Bakhtawar Singh of Alwar concluded a defensive and offensive treaty with the British on 14 November 1803. By this time, British supremacy was established in Northern India. The Alwar chief was rewarded with the grant of several Parganas. His vakeel, Ahmad Baksh Khan received as reward the districts of Ferozpur (from British Government) and Loharu (285 sq. miles) from the Alwar ruler under the title of Nawab. He is said to have become deranged in the evening of his reign and showed his insanity principally by his cruelty to Muslims. The mosques were razed to the ground; the tombs of Muslim saints were dug out and the dwelling of Kamal Chisti (nephew of Salim Chisti) at Alwar, was destroyed. Observing of namaz and offering the sacrifices were forbidden. The Rao died in 1815 A.D. One of his concubines, Musi by name, committed Sati. A magnificent chhatri or cenotaph was erected as a memorial at the side of the tank in the rear of the Alwar Palace.  Maharao Raja Sawai Viney Singh (1815-57 A.D.)  Bakhtawar Singh adopted his nephew Viney Singh son of his brother Salah Singh of Thana, . Great changes were made in the administrative system of the nascent State. He was a great patron of arts and letters, and attracted painters and skilled artisans from various parts of India to his service.He has left many splendid monuments to his name, such as a grand city palace, and a smaller one at Moti Dungri called Viney Vilas. But his greatest work was building of a large bandh at Siliserh, now a fine lake and tourist destination. During the last five years of his life he suffered from paralysis. Bed ridden as he was during the Mutiny of 1857, he despatched a force consisting of about 800 infantry, 400 cavalry and four guns, to the assistance of the beleaguered British garrison at Agra. The cavalry, among whom were all Rajputs - the remainder principally Mahomedans. The Nimach and Nasirabad brigade of mutineers came upon them on the road to Agra. Deserted by their leader and the Mahomedan portion of the force, including the artillery the Rajputs suffered a severe defeat. Viney Singh died in August 1857, before the sorrowful news reached him.  Maharao Raja Sawai Sheodan Singh (1857-1874)  Viney Singh was succeeded by his only surviving son, Sheodan Singh, who was twelve years of age at the time. The actual administration passed on to his Dewan, The Dewan had a domineering influence over the young ruler. On a night in 1858, the Rajputs, under the leadership of Lakhdhir Singh, the Thakur of Bijwar, raised the standard of revolt and raided the dwelling of the Dewan. The Dewan, sensing the danger fled away. British Political Agent got constituted a Council consisting of five Thakurs for salvaging the administration, ruined by Dewans. Another council was also constituted to carry on its duties in a most satisfactory manner until the Maharao Raja was invested with power in 1863. As soon as the Maharao acquired the reins of his State, he renewed his contacts with the expelled Dewan. Several jagirs of Charans, Brahamans and Rajputs were escheated. This resulted in a general unrest. When the Maharao ignored their grievances,disgruntled Rajputs resolved to expel the Muslims from the State. However, Political Agent for East Rajputana took timely action. With permission of the British Government, he interfered in the administration of the State by dismissing the unscrupulous and inefficient officers. The financial bankruptcy of the State was inevitable. A Council was composed of four Thakurs, and a Brahman. A fixed allowance and an establishment was granted to the Maharao. Reforms in the road system were effected, Post and Telegraph lines were laid and systematic survey of the land was made. The Maharao, being divested of all powers, fell ill, and soon passed away.  Maharaj Sawai Mangal Singh (1874-1892 A. D.)  The ruler left no heir to the throne and the families of the Barah Kothri were not unanimous in his selection. At last, Mangal Singh of Thana was supported by a majority and consequently, the Viceroy confirmed him as the ruler of Alwar. He ascended the throne on December 14, 1874. He was fifteen years and a month old at the time. He was created an Honorary Lieutenant Colonel in the British army in 1885 and the following year, was enrolled as a Knight Grand Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India. He received the dignified title of Maharaja as a hereditary distinction in 1889 A.D. He died at the age of 34 years, on May 22, 1892 A.D. at Nainital, owing to excess doze of liquor.  Sawai Maharaja Sir Jey Singh (1892-1937 A.D.)  Maharaja Mangal Singh was succeeded by his minor son, Jey Singh, was invested with ruling powers on December 10, 1903 by Lord Curzon, Under his reign, the police department of the State was reorganised. In 1907-08 the official language was changed from Urdu to Hindi. The Alwar State liberally supported the war effort of the British Government during the World War I. The Mangal Lancers and Jey Paltan fought on various fronts-Suez Canal, Egypt, Sinai, Ghaza and Rapha. The Maharaja was appointed Honorary Lieutenant Colonel in the British army on January 1, 1915 and an Honorary Colonel on 1 January 1921. At the end of the war, the title of G.C.I.E, was conferred on him on January 1, 1919 and that of G.C.S.I., on June 3, 1924. He attended the Imperial Conference held in London in 1923 as a representative of India and was a prominent figure in the Chamber of Princes and at the First Round Table Conference. He was a fine Polo and Racquet player, a scholar of Hindu philosophy and an orator of higher order. He was an outstanding personality in many ways and participated in many National and International conferences. He frequently and fearlessly gave vent to his ideas of nationalism. He always spoke eloquently of the fine cultural heritage and greatness of India as a whole. He had equal command over English and Hindi and also knew Sanskrit. The high British officers in India were already unhappy with him because he would never acknowledge their superiority or submit to them.Bad finances of the State coupled with Meo agitation and the Neemuchana massacre, gave the British authorities opportunity to interfere in his administration and he was in 1933, ultimately asked to leave the State. He died in Paris on 19 May 1937 leaving no lineal or adopted son.  Maharaja Tej Singh (1937-1947)  Sawai Maharaja Sir Tej Singh born on March 19, 1911, was installed on the throne on July 22, 1937. Education made strides during his reign. A number of schools were opened and upgraded. Various communities also started hostels with State aid. Sanskrit College was also opened. The area where Hope Circus now stands was made into a beautiful marketing centre. The closing period of the Maharaja's rule was marred by communal frenzy in which several hundred lives were lost and many more, migrated from the State. After attainment of independence, the ruler signed the instrument of accession which made the Stale a component part of the United States of Matsya.

The normal rainfall for the district is 657.3 mm. The average rainfall in the last ten years in the district is 724 mm. The rainfall distribution in the district is uneven and scattered which resulted in some times flood problems and some time drought position which affect the agriculture production as well as cropping pattern in Kharif & Rabi season. Thus, the agriculture in the district by and large depends on rainfall distribution. The average rainfall in 2016 up to September is 217 mm.

The lake runs Northwest of the village of Zuidlaren and southwards of the city of Hoogezand-Sappemeer and is called Zuidlaardermeer (Dutch for: Lake of Zuidlaren). The lake is largely situated in the provinces of Groningen and Drenthe.Dubbelboer, Beene. Nieuwe Drentse Volksalmanak. Assen: Van Gorcum, 2007, . It was formed 5,000-8,000 years ago. The lake is fed by the river Hunze. This river enters the lake in the south-east and exits the lake in the north as Drentsche Diep.

Indicted for murder in 2003, he played a significant role in the 1968 framing of four men for murder, unjustly imprisoning them for decades. Rico was born in 1925 in Boston. He graduated from Boston College with a bachelor's degree in history. Rico joined the FBI in 1951 at the age of 26 and worked in the Boston area. He used members of the Winter Hill Gang as informants. In 1956 he recognized a disguised James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger in a Revere bar and arrested him. Deegan murder In 1965, Rico received word that gangster Edward \\"Teddy\\" Deegan was killed by members of the Winter Hill Gang, specifically Vincent James Flemmi. He then watched as Joe Barboza testified in court against four men: Peter Limone, Henry Tameleo, Joe Salvati and Louis Greco. Tameleo died in 1985 in prison and Greco died in 1995 in prison, too;Died in prison (Im Gefängnis gestorben) (in German) Salvati was released in 1997, and Limone in 2001.

The five were tried in 1970 for murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the 1968 shotgun murders of Rudolph \\"Rudy\\" Marfeo and Anthony Melei. Kelley testified he had been contracted by Lerner to kill Marfeo and Melei, whom Kelley and Lerner allegedly murdered. After the trial, Kelley went into the federal witness protection program. Patriarca and his associates were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and were sentenced to 10 years in prison. Lerner also was convicted of two counts of murder for which he was sentenced to two life terms in addition to the ten years for conspiracy, all of the sentences to be served consecutively. The jury was unable to reach a verdict for the other four defendants. Lerner's conviction subsequently was quashed by the Rhode Island Supreme Court in 1988. It had been established that Kelley had perjured himself at the trial, as had Rico, who had corroborated Kelley's testimony.Partington, pages 123–4 The Court vacated his conviction and ordered a new trial. Murder indictment and death On October 9, 2003, Rico was indicted for murder in Oklahoma and Florida for helping Bulger and Stephen Flemmi plan the assassination of the millionaire Roger Wheeler on May 27, 1981. Rico died on January 16, 2004 in a Tulsa hospital where he was moved to from prison, still under indictment for the 1981 murder. He was 78.

Studies He was born in Brăila into a family of Aromanian origin, older brother of Ștefan Minovici and Nicolae Minovici. After graduating from the Superior School of Pharmacy he worked as pharmacist for the Eforie Civilian Hospitals. He then attended the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest, graduating in 1885. Right after that he started his forensic training at the University of Paris with Professor Paul Brouardel, and soon after he became his assistant and advisee. Minovici defended his Ph.D. thesis, titled Etude médico-légale sur la mort subite à la suite de coups sur l'abdomen et le larynx, on June 7, 1888. Career In 1889 Minovici was appointed assistant in the Chemistry Department at University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest. In 1892 he became Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Bucharest. Inaugurated on December 20 of that year, the Institute was the first of his kind in the world. The city of Bucharest spent 87,000 lei, and the Romanian government allocated an additional 50,000 lei for the building, which was designed by architect Cristofi Cerchez. The old National Institute of Forensic Medicine \\"Mina Minovici\\" was demolished in 1985, while the new headquarters of the Institute were completed in 1989. In 1896 Minovici became a professor of forensics at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Law. In 1919 he was elected Dean of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy, being renewed in this position in 1923, 1925 and 1930. In 1923, together with the poet Radu D. Rosetti and the politician Grigore Trancu-Iași, he founded Nirvana Society (later Cenușa, \\"The Ash\\"), which operated the Bucharest Crematorium. He died in Bucharest on April 25, 1933 and was buried at Bellu Cemetery. Legacy Minovici was the founder of the modern medico-legal system in Romania, and was one of the most prominent personalities in this field of activity in Europe at that time. He was the first to expand the concept of the morgue and created the term \\"legal medicine\\" as a way of organizing research, teaching and forensic activity.

(November 30, 1886 – December 15, 1981) was an American photographer and a cinematographer of the 1900s through the 1950s. He was also one of the earliest pioneers of 3-D films. While he mostly worked on films, such as F.W. Murnau's Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans and Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator and Limelight, he was also one of the cinematographers for the television series Broken Arrow and photographed 19 episodes of My Friend Flicka. Life and career Karl Struss was born in New York City in 1886. After an illness in high school, Karl's father Henry removed his son from school and placed him as a labor operator at Seybel & Struss bonnet wire factory. He began to develop an interest in photography, experimenting with an 8x10 camera, and beginning in 1908, attended Clarence H. White's evening art photography course at Teachers College at Columbia University, concluding his studies in 1912New York to Hollywood 1995, pp. 19, 92. Early in his studies, he explored the properties of camera lenses and eventually invented in 1909, what he attempted to patent as the Struss Pictorial Lens, a soft-focus lensNew York to Hollywood 1995, pp. 20-21. This lens was considered popular with pictorial photographers of the time. The Struss Pictorial lens was the first soft-focus lens introduced into the motion picture industry in 1916. Initially, Struss gained attention in the photo world when 12 of his pictorial works were chosen by Alfred Stieglitz for the Albright Art Gallery International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography in 1910. This was the final exhibition of the Photo-Secession, an organization that promoted photography as fine art. Struss' reputation was solidified by his inclusion in the exhibition \\"What the Camera Does in the Hand of the Artist\\" at the Newark Art Museum, held in April 1911, and an invitation by the Teacher's College for Struss to organize a one-person exhibition of his views of New York City as well as to teach White's course in the summer of 1912 while White was away.New York to Hollywood 1995, pp. 24-25. Struss was invited by Stieglitz to join the Photo-Secession in 1912, which led to the publication of Struss' photographs in the group's magazine Camera Work. In 1913, Struss, in collaboration with Edward Dickson, Clarence White, Alvin Langdon Coburn, and Paul Anderson, began their own publication, Platinum Print. In 1914, he resigned his position at the family business and asserted his identity as a professional photographer by assuming Clarence White's former studio space in June of that year New York to Hollywood 1995, p. 30. At the suggestion of Coburn, Struss submitted prints to the American Invitational Section of the annual exhibition of the Royal Photographic Society in London, initiating an exhibiting practice he would continue into the 1920s.New York to Hollywood 1995, p. 33. He also participated in numerous exhibitions organized by photography clubs and other associations, including the Pittsburgh Salon of National Photographic Art and the annual photography display organized by the Philadelphia department store Wanamaker's.New York to Hollywood 1995, pp. 226-228. See the appendix (pp. 225-235) for Struss' Lifetime Exhibition Record As Struss continued his exhibitions and specialized commissions, he produced commercial photography for magazines including Vogue, Vanity Fair, and Harper's Bazaar. (However, he was quick to insist that he was not doing fashion photography.) His photographic practice was interrupted by World War I. In 1917, he registered for the draft and then enlisted with the aim of fulfilling his military service through photography.New York to Hollywood 1995, pp. 34-35. He trained to teach aerial photography, but an investigation into Struss's German affiliations launched by the Military Intelligence Department led to his demotion from the rank of sergeant to private; after a period in confinement in Ithaca, New York, where he had originally gone to teach in the new School of Military Aeronautics, he was transferred to Fort Leavenworth to serve as a prison guard and then as a file clerk.New York to Hollywood 1995, pp. 35-41. In the latter role, he took up photography again, documenting the prisoners. Near the close of the war, in an attempt to clear his record of rumors of anti-Americanism, he applied and was accepted into Officer's Training Camp at the rank of corporal.New York to Hollywood 1995, p. 42. While Struss eventually received an honorable discharge, he likely was disinclined to resume his former roles in New York because of the fracturing of many of his professional relationships in the wake of the military investigation.New York to Hollywood 1995, p. 43. In 1919, after his discharge, he moved to Los Angeles and signed with Cecil B. DeMille as a cameraman, initially for the film For Better, For Worse starring Gloria Swanson, followed by another Swanson film Male and Female and leading to a two-year contract with the studioNew York to Hollywood 1995, p. 48. In early 1921, he married Ethel Wall, who helped to support him in his photographic work independent of the film studios, which included pictorial views set in CaliforniaNew York to Hollywood 1995, p. 50. In the 1920s, Struss worked on such films as Ben-Hur and F.W. Murnau's Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. In 1927, he contracted with United Artists, where he worked with D.W. Griffith on films such as Drums of Love and filmed Mary Pickford's first sound film CoquetteNew York to Hollywood 1995, pp. 179-180. He continued his experimental work with camera technology, developing the \\"Lupe Light\\" and a new bracket system for the Bell & Howell camera New York to Hollywood 1995, p. 181. From 1931 through 1945, Struss worked as a cameraman for Paramount, where he worked on a variety of material including films featuring Mae West, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy LamourNew York to Hollywood 1995, p. 182-183. Struss also aimed to shape the field through publishing; for example, in 1934, he wrote \\"Photographic Modernism and the Cinematographer\\" for American Cinematographer. Struss was admitted to the American Society of Cinematographers, and was a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts. In 1949, while working as a freelancer, he began his work in \\"stereo cinematography\\", becoming one of the early proponents of that art form. Unfortunately, he did most of his 3D film work in Italy, and none of his films were released in 3D in the United States. Struss's photographic archive of exhibition prints, film stills, negatives and papers (3 linear feet of materials) is available at the Amon Carter Museum of American Art located in Fort Worth, Texas.Amon Carter Museum Library & Archives Awards In his career, Struss was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography four times. The first time, and the only time he won, was for F.W. Murnau's Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans in 1929, sharing that award with Charles Rosher. He was nominated again in 1932 for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, in 1934 for The Sign of the Cross, and in 1942 for Aloma of the South Seas with Wilfred M. Cline, A.S.C. and William E. Snyder, A.S.C.

Its developed area is a clustered town southwest of Dorking and southeast of Guildford. Most of the village is in the borough of Guildford, within Shere civil parish. Much of the east side of the village street is in the district of Mole Valley, within Abinger civil parish. It contains a building which formerly doubled as a major meeting venue of Beatrice Webb, a Fabian social reformer who co-founded the London School of Economics. It is now the location of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory. Geography Walking trail on Holmbury Hill Holmbury St. Mary is located inside the Hurtwood Forest, which is considered the largest area of common land in Surrey; it takes up part of the Greensand Ridge which in turn contributes to the Surrey Hills AONB. Nearby to the south is Holmbury Hill, which at 857 feet (261 m) is the fourth highest point in Surrey. The summit of Holmbury Hill, containing the hill fort and Bray family memorial cairn, is the only part of the hill to be located in Holmbury, at the Ockley Estate. History Holmbury St Mary, an ecclesiastical parish in Surrey, was formed from the civil parishes of Shere, Abinger, Ewhurst, Cranley, Ockley, and Ockham, in 1878. Originally called Falady, it was renamed after the church was built in 1879; now named after the Holmbury hill and St. Mary's church at its heart overlooking the village green. The church was initiated and paid for in 1879 by George Edmund Street,Folkes, J. Homery \\"The Victorian Architect and George Edmund Street\\" Transactions of the Worcestershire Archaeological Society. Third Series Vol 4 1974 p9St Mary, the Virgin, Holmbury from \\"A Church Near You\\" who had built himself a large house in the village between 1873 and 1876, named \\"Holmdale\\". Holmdale later became home to Thomas Sivewright Catto, the Governor of the Bank of England from 1944 to 1949. When George Edmund Street first visited Felday with his wife, Mariquita in 1872, she was so captivated by the town she called it \\"Heaven's gate\\" and the coupled moved there soon after. Sadly Marquita died in 1874 never having seen the completion of their home or the church. Notable anecdotal evidence once suggested that Holmbury St. Mary (known as Felday) was the site of small and marginally unlisted prisoner of war camp during World War one. It was later discovered to be true by Keith Winser, who undertook a search through the Holmbury parish magazines where he found that construction for the camp was completed in 1917 by the Royal Defence Corps for the internment of German prisoners of war. The prisoners were believed to have been available to the town to be used for manual labor in the timber harvesting of the local forests. These days Holmbury St. Mary is an oddity, as it still, by law, requires Parish council tax payers to pay an additional sum - a Precept - to one of two civil parishes in England. Notable landmarks =Beatrice Webb House and Trust= From 1947 to 1986, a large building hosted the Webb Memorial Trust for Rethinking Poverty as a tribute to Beatrice Webb and her work. The Beatrice Webb House was opened by Clement Attlee and served as an important education and discussion facility for the Fabian Society, British Labour Party and trade unions. The Fabian Window, designed by George Bernard Shaw (who co-founded the London School of Economics (LSE) with Sidney and Beatrice Webb), depicting the founders of the Fabian Society, hung in the house until it was stolen in 1978. The window was recovered in 2005 and is now on long-term loan to the London School of Economics. Today the house is a boarding house for Hurtwood House School. =St. Mary's Church= Altar and East Window, St Mary the Virgin The Church of St. Mary the Virgin is part of the Leith Hill United Benefice which includes the churches of St James, Abinger Common and Christ Church, Coldharbour. Inside it has a triptych behind the altar that is attributed to Spinello Aretino and in the North Chapel a painting attributed to Jacopo da Sellaio. The surgeon, histologist and anatomist Sir William Bowman, 1st Baronet is buried in the village churchyard along with Mariquita Street, second daughter of Robert Proctor. =Mullard Space Science Laboratory= Holmbury St. Mary is home to the University College London's Department of Space and Climate Physics Mullard Space Science Laboratory, which is the country's largest purely University-led space science research group. The laboratory was established at Holmbury St. Mary in 1966 and since then has participated in more than 35 satellite missions and over 200 rocket experiments. Village =Physical Attributes= The village layout is known as a nucleated village, that centres around a church over looking the village green. The village itself is situated within a ravine, which had once been home to small sandstone quarry and clay brick businesses for the area. The village contains two contrasting styles of architecture represented by the Woodhouse Copse, an Arts and Crafts style cottage designed by Oliver Hill in 1926, and Joldwynds, a Modernist house also by Oliver Hill, in 1932. Though many of the houses these days have a brick exterior leaning more towards the cottage style. =Demography= By 1911 the village had a population of 651 individuals while today there are only 572 people still living there. The UK Government has produced maps to show the developed parts of two of 2011 Census Output Areas approximate to the relevant area, E00155533 and E00155534.http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=1254248281 Respectively these have the following attributes: ;Western Output Area There were 343 usual residents as at Census day 2011. Of these, 98.3% lived in households and 1.7% lived in communal establishments. The average (mean) age of residents was 44.5 years. ;Eastern Output Area There were 229 usual residents as at Census day 2011. Of these, 100% lived in households and 0% lived in communal establishments. The average (mean) age of residents was 43.1 years.http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=1254248280 =Schools= The village has two main schools: Belmont Preparatory School, and Hurtwood House, catering for ages 2 to 13 and 16 to 18 respectively. While the Moon Hall School provides special education to children with dyslexia. The Belmont school is also well known for its summer teens language camp which is a four week program that offers a dynamic English curriculum and fun activities. =Sports= Holmbury St. Mary has two football teams, both of which compete in the Guildford and Woking Alliance. The 1st XI are in the Premier Division and the newly formed 2nd XI are in the 3rd Division. Holmbury also has two cricket teams. The first XI plays in Division Two of the Surrey Downs League and the second XI plays in the Second Division of the Village Cricket League. The Village Club, The Hollybush Tavern, also has its own cricket side which plays friendly matches. Annual events Holmbury St. Mary has an annual bonfire and fireworks night in the Glade, organised and funded by a group known as The Bonfire Boys who gather wood from the Hurtwood and put on a fireworks show on the weekend following Halloween. Thousands attend and all profits are donated to charities. The village also holds annual Spring and Summer flower shows, organised by the Holmbury St Mary Horticultural Society. They offer competitions in a range of events and winning prizes. Holmbury St. Mary's religious community offer a range of celebrations held by the church, including choral performances and popular Christmas services. In film, fiction and other popular culture Holmbury St. Mary is believed to be the basis for the fictional village of Summer Street in A Room With A View. Its author, E.M. Forster, was a long-standing resident in Abinger Hammer in the deep valley below to the north.

Born Lillian Zaki Mourad Mordechai to a Jewish family 1918 in the El Daher District in Cairo, she later changed her name to Leila Mourad as a stage-name. Leila married three times and divorced three times . She converted to Islam early in her life and died in 1995.  Life  Leila Mourad was born on February 17, 1918 to Egyptian Jewish parents, Ibrahim Zaki Murad Mordechai and Gamilah Ibrahim Roushou, the daughter of Ibrahim Roushou, a local concert contractor in the early 20th century who regularly booked Zaki Mourad to sing at concerts and wedding parties. Her father was a respected singer, musician, and religious Jewish cantor (Hazzan). One of her brothers, Mounir Mourad, was an actor and composer. She made her first stage appearance, aged nine, at the Saalat Badi'a, one of Cairo's most successful Music Halls. The theatre had been founded in 1926 by the actress and dancer Badi'a Masabni, who became Mourad's patron.Danielson, Virginia (1977) The Voice of Egypt. Umm Kulthum, Arabic song, and Egyptian society in the twentieth century. AUC Press, Cairo. . pp.48,67 Her first film appearance, aged fifteen, was in the 1932 \\" Al- Dahaaya \\" (The Victims) which had originally been made as a silent film. Her song, The Day of Departure, was added as part of the transformation of the production into a \\"talkie\\".Darwish, Mustafa (1998) Dream Makers on the Nile. A Portrait of Egyptian Cinema. AUC Press, Cairo. . p.24 She was trained by her father and Dawood Hosni, who was also Jewish. Hosni had composed the first operetta in the Arabic language, and he composed two songs for Leila: Hairana Leh Bein El-Eloub (Why can't you choose from among lovers), and Howa el dala'a ya'ani khessam (Does daliance mean avoiding me?). Further success came when the prominent Egyptian composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab heard her singing and gave her a role in his film Yahia el Hob (Viva Love!) in 1938. In the six years following the success of Yahia el Hob she made five best selling films with director Togo Mizrahi, becoming Egypt's top actress. In 1945 she made Layla Bint al-Fuqara (\\"Layla, daughter of the poor\\") directed by Anwar Wagdi whom she married shortly after. She went on to make a further 20 films of which the most outstanding is Ghazel el-Banat (\\"The Flirtation of Girls\\"), also directed and co-starring Wagdi. It also featured Nagib al-Rihani and Abdel Wahab in their last appearances on film.Darwish. pp.24,25 Layla holding a photo of Egypt's President Mohamed Naguib, circa 1953. Egyptian Army general command denying the allegations held against Layla, October 27, 1952. In 1953, she was selected, over Umm Kulthum, as the official singer of the Egyptian revolution(citation needed). Shortly thereafter, a rumor that Mourad had visited Israel, where she had family, and donated money to its military, raised suspicions of spying and caused some Arab radio stations to boycott her. She denied these allegations .Beinin, Joel (1998). The Dispersion of Egyptian Jewry. University of California Press. 1st edition. p. 84. No proof was found that she had contributed money to Israel's military; the Egyptian government investigated and concluded that the charges against the singer were without foundation. Her decision to retire, aged 38, came with the failure of her last film, Al Habib al Majhoul (The Unknown Lover), the banning of her song, With Unity, Order, and Work, praising the Free Officers 1952 revolution and the outbreak of the 1956 war.Darwish. p.24 Despite the immense popularity of her films her singing career was over-shadowed by Um Kulthum who dominated Egypt's musical landscape and, in 1949, had become president of the Musicians' Union. In the early 1950s other singers also popular with younger audiences, such as Abdel al Halim Hafez, did not get the same exposure on the radio as Um Kulthum.Danielson. p.120 Leila Mourad's relationship with her family was not an easy one, possibly due to money and her conversion to Islam. Between 1967 and 1970, hundreds of Egyptian Jewish males were deported to the prisons of Abu Zaabal and Tura, including one of Leila's brothers, Isak Zaki. Families of the detainees were allowed to visit beginning in 1968, and some noted that Leila was never seen visiting her brother. Leila Mourad made a few brief reappearances during Ramadan in 1970, when she was scheduled to read Salah Jaheen's \\"Fawazeer Ramadan\\" (Ramadan' puzzles), a daily traditional radio program held during the Holy month of Ramadan. Leila Mourad died in a Cairo hospital in 1995. Her funeral took place at Omar Makram mosque.  Marriages  Leila Mourad married Anwar Wagdi (married 1945 – divorced 1953), over the objection of her father. She married him and divorced. Leila gave the reason for her divorce as the fact that she was not fully aware of the seriousness of Wagdi's illness, one that made him constantly irritable and difficult to live with. Later she married secretly Wagih Abaza ( married 1955 – divorced 1956) and gave birth to Ashraf Wagih Abaza and divorced . Then she married a film director Fatin Abdel Wahab 1957 and she gave birth to their son Zaki Fatin Abdel Wahab, and finally divorced in 1969.

He was the head of the Communist Party of Germany following the assassination of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in 1919. After being expelled for publicly criticising Communist Party tactics during the March Action, he formed the Communist Working Organisation (KAG / Kommunistische Arbeitsgemeinschaft) which in 1922 merged with the Independent Social Democratic Party. This party, in turn, merged with the Social Democratic Party a few months later and Levi became one of the leaders of its left wing. Biography =Early years= Paul Levi was born on 11 March 1883 in Hechingen in Hohenzollern Province to a well-to-do Jewish merchant family. He attended the Gymnasium in Stuttgart. Levi started work as a lawyer in Frankfurt in 1906 and also joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) the same year. There he became part of the party’s left wing together with Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. Beginning in 1913, Levi was also Luxemburg's lawyer in political cases. In 1914 he was elected as an SPD town councillor in Frankfurt. Levi was one of the twelve delegates to the meeting in March 1915 which led to the formation of the Gruppe Internationale which became the Spartacist League. The following month he was conscripted to the army and sent to the Vosges. After starving himself, Levi was discharged on medical grounds in 1916, settling in Switzerland and associating with Karl Radek, Grigory Zinoviev and Vladimir Lenin, becoming a part of the bureau of the Zimmerwald Left and helping found La nouvelle internationale which he wrote for under the pseudonym 'Hartstein'. He was one of the signatories to a declaration approving of Lenin and other Russian revolutionaries actions in travelling through Germany in a sealed train. Levi returned to Germany after the October Revolution and from March 1918 lived mostly in Berlin where he was one of the three editors of the Spartakusbriefe. At the founding conference of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) on 30–31 December 1918, he introduced the discussion on 'The National Assembly'. Levi was amongst the majority on the KPD Zentrale who opposed the initiatives of Karl Liebknecht and Wilhelm Pieck who had supported a Revolutionary Committee with the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and the Revolutionary Stewards to lead what became known as the Spartacist Uprising in January 1919. =Communist leader= Paul Levi at the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern, 1920. After the killing of the KPD’s main leaders Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Leo Jogiches, Levi took over as the central leader of the Communist Party. At the KPD's second congress in October 1919, Levi expelled the party's Council Communist ultra-left, around half the membership many of whom formed the Communist Workers' Party of Germany. During the Kapp Putsch Levi was in prison. Levi headed the German delegation to the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International in Moscow in 1920, where he threatened that the KPD delegation would leave due to the presence of representatives of the KAPD. He led the party away from the policy of immediate revolution, orientating it to wider layers of workers. These efforts were rewarded when a substantial section of the USPD joined the KPD after a debate at their Halle congress, making it a mass party for the first time with around 449,700 members. This was followed up by an 'Open Letter' which Levi, alongside Radek, convinced the KPD Zentrale to issue to other working class organisation to join in a joint struggle around their common interests, based on a successful initiative of Communists in Stuttgart. Levi attended the 1921 Livorno congress of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) which had joined the Comintern, where Levi had supported Giacinto Serrati against the faction around Antonio Gramsci and Amadeo Bordiga who went on to form the Italian Communist Party (PCI) supported by Comintern representatives Mátyás Rákosi and Khristo Kabakchiev. Following a debate at the Zentrale over Italy where Levi and his supporters lost the vote by a small majority after being opposed by Radek and Rákosi, he resigned from the chairmanship of the Communist Party in early 1921, alongside his co- chairman Ernst Däumig and Clara Zetkin, Otto Brass and Adolf Hofman also resigned from the Central Committee. This had been preceded by the \\"small bureau\\" of the Comintern condemning the \\"Open Letter\\" and awarding the KAPD sympathising section status. Shortly after, under the influence of Béla Kun, the party launched the March Action of 1921. As leader of the KPD, Levi frequently criticized \\"putschism,\\" or the repeated efforts on behalf of Communists to take power without the broader support of the masses. He first observed this phenomenon in the failed revolutionary experiences in Bavaria and Hungary in 1919. Later on, after the disastrous March Action, Levi wrote his most famous pamphlet Unser Weg: Wider den Putschismus. In it, he laid out his criticisms of the Comintern, the KPD, and what he called the \\"Bakuninist\\" influence behind what he argued were numerous premature attempts to take state power. Levi cited both Engels and Marx on insurrection, showing how other Party members of the KPD had overlooked the careful preparatory work of the Bolsheviks leading up to the October 1917 Revolution. He simultaneously criticized Comintern representatives such as Béla Kun, Grigory Zinoviev and Karl Radek for their encouragement of these accelerationist policies both in Germany and Italy. Levi's criticism of the Comintern and \\"putschism\\" served as an early attempt to explain the failure of European Revolutions in the 1918-1923 period. Following the failure of the uprisings Levi was expelled from the Communist Party for publicly criticizing party policies in his pamphlet Unser Weg. Lenin and Trotsky substantially agreed with his criticisms, but not the way in which he had made them. Lenin sent him a private letter through his friend Clara Zetkin,See \\"To Clara Zetkin and Paul Levi\\" in which he asked Levi to accept the expulsion for \\"breach of discipline\\" and then adopt a friendly approach towards the KPD and cooperate with it in the class struggle in a loyal manner. If Levi would do so, Lenin would then push for his reinstatement in the party. Levi did not accept this proposal and continued to criticize the party sharply and condemn its leaders.Frédéric Cyr: Paul Levis Kampf um die KPD, in: Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung, No. I/2010 (German language), this led Lenin to revise his previously still favourable attitude towards Levi.Lenin, V.I. Notes of a Publicist, February 1922 =Later life, death, and legacy= After being expelled from the Communist Party, Levi formed the Communist Working Collective (KAG) with supporters expelled from the KPD at its Jena congress in September 1921, which included 13 of the KPD's Reichstag deputies (including Levi himself). In 1922 he joined the USPD, with whom he subsequently rejoined the SPD. Levi began rethinking his previous policies and wrote introductions to Rosa Luxemburg's The Russian Revolution and Leon Trotsky's Lessons of October, which were sharply critical of the Bolsheviks. In the summer of 1921 Levi founded a monthly magazine named Unser Weg (\\"Our Way\\"), which he later replaced with a weekly Sozialistiche und politische Wochentliche (also known as Levi-Korrespondenz) when he rejoined the SPD. Because of his Jewish roots, he became the target of a hateful anti-Semitic campaign in the press. He responded by attacking prominent Nazis, such as Adolf Hitler, Ernst Röhm, Alfred Rosenberg and Wilhelm Frick in left-wing publications. In 1924, Levi was re-elected to the Reichstag in Zwickau for the SPD, where he held meetings in remote village, conducted some legal cases and held education classes. Although his interventions were restricted in the Reichstag, he represented the SPD on the Reichstag's legal committee and spoke on issues of civil liberties. Levi also began to specialise in defending writers and newspapers that disclosed government secrets, but took up other civil liberties cases, including those of KPD members such as Willi Münzenberg. Levi died on 9 February 1930 in Berlin after succumbing to injuries suffered when he fell from the window of his fifth floor attic flat. He had been taken to bed with pneumonia during a trial, where he had become feverish and delirious. Levi received numerous obituaries, including from Albert Einstein. However Lazitch & Drachkovitch relate: \\"He committed suicide in 1930 by jumping from a window at a clinic where he was being treated.\\"Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, The Hoover Institution Press, 1986, p.259. After his death the Reichstag held a minute of commemoration during which the representatives of the Communist Party and the Nazi Party ostentatiously left the assembly hall. At his funeral, fellow dissident communist Valeriu Marcu presented the eulogy.Lazitch & Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, The Hoover Institution Press, 1986, p.301.

Richmond was a washtub bassist. and was also a professional jug player. Richmond, born in Newton, Massachusetts on July 10, 1939, was a founding member of The Hoppers, a school-chum jug band that played the coffeehouse circuit in the Boston area. Jug band music featured homemade or folk-style instruments such as the washboard (used for percussion), a large earthenware jug used as a wind instrument, and a single-string upright bass fashioned from a broomstick or similar handle, using a steel washtub as a resonator, with the player moving the handle in order to vary the tension on the string and thus vary the pitch of the note created by plucking. This type of music, in England, became known as skiffle music and was played by groups who could not afford electric instruments, such as The Quarrymen, a Liverpool skiffle group that evolved into The Beatles. After a stint in the Army and then a gig with The Charles River Valley Boys, Richmond was a founding member and a longtime jug and washtub player in the extremely influential Jim Kweskin Jug Band in the 1960s. Following the breakup of the Kweskin band, Richmond moved to the West coast and became an in-demand accompanist as American rock began to embrace folk and country roots. During his life, Richmond was routinely given accolades such as world's best living jug player\\", undisputed king and reigning world champion of the jug and washtub bass\\", and \\"the world’s greatest living jug and washtub bass player\\". Richmond’s washtub and jug stylings provided old-time music flavor on recordings for a large network of artists that included Jackson Browne (\\"Walking Slow\\"), Loudon Wainwright III, Maria Muldaur, Geoff Muldaur, Tom Rush, Ry Cooder, Norman Greenbaum, and The Grateful Dead. Richmond also worked as a recording engineer for many artists, principally on Elektra Records for artists such as The Doors, and his credits can be found on albums by, among others, Warren Zevon, Bonnie Raitt, and Jackson Browne. Richmond also contributed a key counterculture fashion accessory. Roger McGuinn and John Sebastian credit Richmond with the introduction of \\"granny glasses\\" in the early 1960s. A well-known photo by John Byrne Cooke shows Richmond wearing his homemade pair in 1963, long before John Lennon popularized the \\"British welfare glasses\\". Spectacles like Richmond’s – consisting initially of colored non-prescription glass set into old wire-frames, thus shielding the often-stoned performer's eyes from public view – then became common on the San Francisco rock scene where the Jim Kweskin Jug Band was paired in concert with bands such as The Doors and Big Brother and the Holding Company. Janis Joplin and Jerry Garcia, who also socialized with Richmond, were among those who adopted the colored-lens look. Richmond also came up with the name for the band The Lovin’ Spoonful. Richmond continued to perform through 2004. For approximately the last decade of his life he was a core member of John Sebastian’s J-Band, and a sometime member of The Fountain of Youth. Music writer Jim Mitchell described Richmond as a \\"notorious luminary in the field of old-time American music. Nobody with even the slightest knowledge of jug band music and traditional string-band repertoire can overlook his contributions … which are indeed of historical significance.\\" One of Richmond’s washtub basses is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Richmond died in Portland, Oregon of lung cancer on November 20, 2005, mourned and celebrated by the folk community.

Together with Grigore Antipa, he was one of the most noted promoters of natural sciences in Romania. Racoviță was the first Romanian to have gone on a scientific research expedition to the Antarctic. He was an influential professor, scholar and researcher, and served as President of the Romanian Academy from 1926 to 1929. Early life Born in Iași, he grew up on a family estate, in Șurănești, Vaslui County, he started his education in Iași, where he had Ion Creangă as a teacher, and continued his secondary education at the Institutele Unite, a private high school for boys in Iași, taking his baccalauréat in 1886. He then studied law at the University of Paris, obtaining a law degree in 1889. But he did not pursue a law career, instead turning to the natural sciences.Keith Rodney Benson, Philip F. Rehbock (2002). Oceanographic history: the Pacific and beyond, University of Washington, p. 272. His mentor was zoologist and biologist Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers, a professor at the Sorbonne and at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle. Racoviță earned a B.S. degree in 1891, and a Ph.D. degree in 1896, for a thesis on Le lobe cephalique et l’encéphale des Annélides Polychète (\\"The cephalous lobe and the encephalon of polychaetous annelids\\"). Belgica expedition in the Gerlache Strait As a promising young scientist, Racoviță was selected to be part of an international team that started out on a research expedition to Antarctica, aboard the . The expedition was led by the Belgian officer Adrien de Gerlache, who was also the ship's owner. =Ship and crew= On 16 August 1897, under the aegis of the Royal Society of Geography in Brussels, the Belgica, a former Norwegian wooden whaler, left the port of Antwerp, setting sail for the South. It was the ship that gave its name to the whole expedition. The three-mast ship was equipped with a 160 horse-power engine. The 19 members of the team were of various nationalities. The first mate of the vessel was Roald Amundsen – who was to conquer the South Pole in 1911. Apart from Racoviță, the team was made up of Belgian physicist Émile Danco, Polish geologist and oceanographer Henryk Arctowski with his assistant Antoni Bolesław Dobrowolski and American physician Frederick Cook. = Scientific work = Racoviță diving in 1899 The team left the deck of the ship 22 times, in order to collect scientific data, to conduct investigations and experiments. Racoviță was the first researcher to collect botanical and zoological samples from areas beyond the Antarctic Circle. Belgica made the first daily meteorological recordings and measurements in Antarctica, every hour, for a whole year. The scientists also collected information on oceanic currents and terrestrial magnetism, with as many as 10 volumes of scientific conclusions being published at the end of the expedition, which was considered a success. = Obstacles = The expedition encountered several hardships. Between 10 March 1898 and 14 March 1899, Belgica was caught between ice blocks, making it impossible to sail any further. The crew had to carve a canal through a layer of ice, in order to generate a waterway by which to sail to a navigable body of water. Belgica returned to Europe in 1899 without two team-members, who had died during the expedition: Norwegian mariner Carl Wiencke (lost overboard), and Émile Danco {died natural causes}. Racoviță's diary, published in 1899, makes mention of the difficulties that the team-members had to endure. Photos of the time show that he was hardly recognisable after returning from the expedition. The results of his research were published in 1900, under the title La vie des animaux et des plantes dans l'Antarctique (\\"The life of animals and plants in Antarctica\\"). A year after his return, Racoviță was appointed director of the Banyuls-sur-Mer resort and editor of the review Archives de zoologie expérimentale et générale.  Later life  Statue in Palma de Mallorca Racoviță continued his research, contributing to speleology and exploring over 1,400 caves in France, Spain, Algeria, Italy, and Slovenia. He is considered to be, together with René Jeannel, one of the founders of biospeleology. He was particularly interested in isopoda, of which he discovered many. In 1919, Racoviță became head of the biology department at the Upper Dacia University in Cluj-Napoca, and served as Rector of the University from 1929 to 1930. He founded the world's first speleological institute there on 26 April 1920, first as a section which was, however, to function independently since 1956, with professor Constantin Motas. In 1920, he became a titular member of the Romanian Academy, and served as President of the Academy from 1926 to 1929. In the aftermath of the Second Vienna Award of August 1940, the Faculty of Sciences and the Institute of Speleology at the University of Cluj were forced to move out of the city and take refuge in Timișoara. After World War II, Racoviță made great efforts to reorganize the institute. He died in November 1947 in Cluj-Napoca, and was buried in the city's Hajongard Cemetery. Legacy Stamp from 2007 There are two caves based after him. One is the , located in Criva, Briceni; with an area of , it is the largest cave in Moldova and the third longest cave in Europe. The other one is the , located in Iabalcea, Caraș-Severin County. In 2006, the first Romanian Antarctic exploration station was named the Law-Racoviță Station. Poșta Română issued several stamps in his honor: 55 bani and 1.20 lei stamps in 1958, a 55 bani stamp in 1968, a 4 lei stamp in 1985, a 2 lei stamp in 1986, a 4.50 lei stamp in 1997, and a 1.60 lei stamp in 2007. The last one is part of a series of four stamps (Scott 4911–4914) commemorating 100 years since the foundation by Racoviță of the first biospeleology institute in the world. In 2018, on the 150th anniversary of Racoviță's birth, the National Bank of Romania put into circulation a commemorative silver coin with a face value of 10 lei.

While an evolutionary development of the straight- wing F-84 Thunderjet, the F-84F was a new design. The RF-84F Thunderflash was a photo reconnaissance version. Development In 1948, a swept wing version of the F-84 was created with the hope of bringing performance to the level of the F-86. The last production F-84E was fitted with a swept tail, a new wing with 38.5 degrees of leading edge sweep and 3.5 degrees of anhedral, and a J35-A-25 engine producing 5,300 pound-force (23.58 kN) of thrust.Knaack 1978, p. 42. The aircraft was designated XF-96A. It flew on 3 June 1950 with Otto P. Haas at the controls. Although the airplane was capable of 602 knots (693 mph, 1,115 km/h), the performance gain over the F-84E was considered minor. Nonetheless, it was ordered into production in July 1950 as the F-84F Thunderstreak. The F-84 designation was retained because the fighter was expected to be a low-cost improvement of the straight-wing Thunderjet with over 55 percent commonality in tooling. alt= In the meantime, the USAF, hoping for improved high-altitude performance from a more powerful engine, arranged for the British Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engine to be built in the United States as the Wright J65. To accommodate the larger engine, YF-84Fs with a British-built Sapphire as well as production F-84Fs with the J65 had a vertically stretched fuselage, with the air intake attaining an oval cross- section. Production delays with the F-84F forced the USAF to order a number of straight-wing F-84Gs as an interim measure. Production quickly ran into problems. Although tooling commonality with the Thunderjet was supposed to be 55 percent, in reality only fifteen percent of tools could be reused. To make matters worse, the F-84F utilized press-forged wing spars and ribs. At the time, only three presses in the United States could manufacture these, and priority was given to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet bomber over the F-84. The YJ65-W-1 engine was considered obsolete and the improved J65-W-3 did not become available until 1954. When the first production F-84F finally flew on 22 November 1952, it differed from the service test aircraft. It had a different canopy which opened up and back instead of sliding to the rear (a unique design, the canopy was mounted on a pair of hydraulic rams and a pivoted lever arm that allowed it to lift up and backwards while remaining almost level with the fuselage, instead of the more common simple hinged canopy), as well as airbrakes on the sides of the fuselage instead of the bottom of the aircraft. The aircraft was considered not ready for operational deployment due to control and stability problems. The first 275 aircraft, equipped with conventional stabilizer-elevator tailplanes, suffered from accelerated stall pitch-up and poor turning ability at combat speeds. Beginning with Block 25, the problem was improved upon by the introduction of a hydraulically powered one-piece stabilator. A number of aircraft were also retrofitted with spoilers for improved high-speed control. As a result, the F-84F was not declared operational until 12 May 1954. =Thunderflash= alt= The second YF-84F prototype was completed with wing-root air intakes. These were not adopted for the fighter due to loss of thrust. However, this arrangement permitted placement of cameras in the nose and the design was adopted for the RF-84F Thunderflash reconnaissance version. The first YRF-84F was completed in February 1952. The aircraft retained an armament of four machine guns and could carry up to fifteen cameras. Innovations included computerized controls which adjusted camera settings for light, speed, and altitude, a periscope to give the pilot better visualization of the target, and a voice recorder to let the pilot narrate his observations. Being largely identical to the F-84F, the Thunderflash suffered from the same production delays and engine problems, delaying operational service until March 1954. The aircraft was retired from active duty in 1957, only to be reactivated in 1961, and finally retired from the ANG in 1972. Several modified Thunderflashes were used in the FICON project. Design The Thunderstreak suffered from the same poor takeoff performance as the straight-wing Thunderjet despite having a more powerful engine. In reality, almost 700 pounds-force (3.11 kN) or ten percent of total thrust was lost because the J65 was installed at an angle and its jet pipe was not perfectly straight (in addition to the usual thrust losses from the long jet pipe). On a hot day, 7,500 feet (2,285 m) of runway were required for takeoff roll.Higham, Robin and Carol Williams. Flying Combat Aircraft of USAAF-USAF (Vol.2). Rockville, Maryland: Air Force Historical Foundation, 1978. . A typical takeoff speed was 160 knots (185 mph, 300 km/h). Like the Thunderjet, the Thunderstreak excelled at cruise and had predictable handling characteristics within its performance envelope. Like its predecessor, it also suffered from accelerated stall pitch-up and potential resulting separation of wings from the airplane. In addition, spins in the F-84F were practically unrecoverable and ejection was the only recourse below 10,000 feet (3,000 m). Operational history An Ohio Air National Guard F-84F in the late 1960s F-84F Thunderstreaks flown by USAF Thunderbirds F-84F Project Run In completed operational tests in November 1954 and found the aircraft to be to USAF satisfaction and considerably better than the F-84G. However, ongoing engine failures resulted in the entire fleet being grounded in early 1955. Also, the J65 engine continued to suffer from flameouts when flying through heavy rain or snow. As the result of the problems, the active duty phaseout began almost as soon as the F-84F entered service in 1954, and was completed by 1958. Increased tensions in Germany associated with construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 resulted in reactivation of the F-84F fleet. In 1962, the fleet was grounded due to the corrosion of control rods. A total of 1,800 man hours were expended to bring each aircraft to full operational capacity. Stress corrosion eventually forced the retirement of ANG F-84Fs in 1971. On 9 March 1955, Lt. Col. Robert R. Scott, in a F-84F Thunderstreak, set a three-hour, 44-minute and 53-second record for the 2,446 mile flight from Los Angeles to New York. With the appearance of the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, which used wing-root mounted air intakes of a similar design to those fitted on the RF-84F, the photorecon variant Thunderflash became known as the Thud's Mother. The earlier F-84A had been nicknamed the \\"Hog\\" and the F-84F \\"Super Hog,\\" the F-105 becoming the \\"Ultra Hog\\". In what is probably one of the very few air-to-air engagements involving the F-84F, two Turkish Air Force F-84F Thunderstreaks shot down two Iraqi Il-28 Beagle bombers that crossed the Turkish border by mistake during a bombing operation against Iraqi Kurdish insurgents. This engagement took place on 16 August 1962.Cooper, Tom. \\"Europe & Cold War Database: Cyprus, 1955–1973.\\" Air Combat Information Group, 26 October 2003. Retrieved: 8 September 2009. The F-84F was retired from active service with the USAF in 1964, and replaced by the North American F-100 Super Sabre. The RF-84F was replaced by the RF-101 Voodoo in USAF units, and relegated to duty in the Air National Guard. The last F-84F Thunderflash retired from the ANG in 1971. Three Hellenic Air Force RF-84Fs that were retired in 1991 were the last operational F-84s.

Tactical Air Command aircraft were equipped with Low-Altitude Bombing System (LABS) for delivering nuclear bombs. 2,711 built, 1,301 went to NATO under Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP). ;GRF-84F:25 RF-84Fs were converted to be carried, and launched from the bomb bay of a GRB-36F bomber as part of the FICON project. The aircraft were later redesignated RF-84K. ;RF-84F Thunderflash:Reconnaissance version of the F-84F with intakes relocated to the wing-roots, 715 built. ;RF-84K Thunderflash (FICON): RF-84F with a retractable probe for hookup with carrier GRB-36Ds and tailplanes with marked anhedral, 25 redesignated from RF-84F. ;XF-84H: Two F-84Fs were converted into experimental aircraft. Each was fitted with an Allison XT40-A-1 turboprop engine of 5,850 shaft horsepower (4,365 kW) driving a supersonic propeller. Ground crews dubbed the XF-84H the Thunderscreech due to its extreme noise output. ;YF-84J: Two F-84Fs were converted into YF-84J prototypes with enlarged nose intakes and a deepened fuselages for the General Electric J73 engine; the YF-84J reached Mach 1.09 in level flight on 7 April 1954. The project was cancelled due to the excessive cost of converting existent F-84Fs.

Accidents and incidents *On 7 July 1954, one F-84F of a flight of four en route to Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, TX, crashed into the Kansas City, Kansas business district shortly after departing Fairfax Municipal Airport, Kansas City, KS. 2nd Lt. John H. Kapeles, pilot, assigned to the 27th Fighter Escort Wing, died in the crash. Three civilians died on the ground when the plane crashed onto their homes. The plane had just come off the General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant production line and had been test flown. Eyewitnesses reported that the plane plunged at a high rate of speed toward the ground after the flight had banked toward the west from the east. The three remaining planes returned to Fairfax Municipal Airport.Kansas City Star, Main Edition, Pg. 1, July 7, 1954 * On 9 December 1955, a USAF F-84F on an instrument training flight from RAF Sculthorpe in Norfolk experienced a flameout and the pilot ejected. The aircraft crashed into Lodge Moor Hospital, Sheffield. The crash killed one patient and injured seven others. * On 4 April 1957, the USAF Captain Richard W. Higgins died after a low ejection with one of the first F-84Fs of the German Air Force near the Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base. * On 14 September 1961, two West German F-84Fs of the West German Air Force crossed into East German airspace due to a navigational error, eventually landing at Berlin Tegel Airport, evading a large number of Soviet fighter aircraft. The event came at a historically difficult time during the Cold War, one month after the construction of the Berlin Wall.\\"Strauss-Befehl: Bier-Order 61\\". Der Spiegel, 9 May 1962.

On the island (from north to south) are the resort communities of Atlantic City, Ventnor, Margate, and Longport. The island ends at Absecon Inlet to the north and Great Egg Harbor Inlet to the south. Geography A barrier island, Absecon Island extends between Absecon Inlet on the northeast and Great Egg Harbor Inlet to the southwest. Absecon Island was described in 1834 as, An 1878 description of Absecon Island is as follows, viz,  History  Absecon's earliest European settlers were English who earned their living clamming and oystering. Land there was bought not for farming but for control of the waterways. The name Absecon came from the word \\"Absegami\\" or little water, named by the Native Americans living along Absecon Creek.Absecon & Absecon Island, Atlantic County, New Jersey. Accessed August 12, 2008.Absecon & Absecon Island, Atlantic County, New Jersey. Accessed In 1695, Thomas Budd purchased 10,000 acres (40 km²) of land in what later became Atlantic County. He paid 4 cents an acre ($9.88/km²) for land on which Atlantic City now stands. It was called Further Island (further from Absecon) and later called Absecon Beach and finally became Atlantic City. Jeremiah Leeds was the first permanent settler on Absecon Island in 1785. He came from Leeds Point to Absecon Island when it was a complete wilderness. He built a cabin of cedar logs and cleared a field where the Atlantic City Expressway now ends in Atlantic City. The block called Columbus Plaza was part of the Leeds farm. Most of the homes in Atlantic City until 1854 were built by descendants of Jeremiah Leeds. Jeremiah's son Chalkey S. Leeds became the first mayor of Atlantic City in 1854 and his youngest son, Robert, became the first postmaster of Atlantic City. In 1819, Dr. Jonathan Pitney went to Absecon to set up his medical practice. His visits to Absecon Island convinced him that the island had the climate ideal for a health resort. He was instrumental in convincing the municipal authorities that a railroad to the beach would be beneficial. He has been called the \\"Father of Atlantic City\\". The first beachwalk or \\"boardwalk\\" in Atlantic City was completed in 1870 by Simon Luchs Wescoat. Because of its success as a resort, a second railroad was built in 1877. Fifty-four miles of track was laid in record time - 98 days.  Beach reclamation  As a barrier island, the beaches of Absecon Island are continuously affected by erosion, particularly in the event of nor'easters, hurricanes and other coastal storms. The United States Army Corps of Engineers is undertaking a project to construct an approximate $63 million beach and dune system along the 8.1 mile oceanfront of Absecon Island.

It has been the home of the Prideaux family for over 400 years. The house was built in 1592 by Sir Nicholas Prideaux (1550–1627), a distinguished lawyer,Prideaux Place website and was enlarged and modified by successive generations, most notably by his great-great-grandson Edmund Prideaux (1693–1745) and by the latter's grandson Rev. Charles Prideaux-Brune (1760–1833). The present building, containing 81 rooms, combines the traditional E-shape of Elizabethan architecture with the 18th-century exuberance of Horace Walpole’s Strawberry Hill Gothic. The house contains a fine collection of works of art, including royal and family portraits, fine furniture and the Prideaux Porcelain Collection. The recently uncovered ceiling in the Great Chamber is a masterpiece of the art of the Elizabethan plasterer. In 1968 the estate comprised about 3,500 acres, excluding the St Breock estate situated about ten miles away, also in the family's ownership, inherited from the Viell family in the 17th century. The deer park is one of the most ancient in England, containing in 1968 about 100 fallow deer, increased from only about six in 1946 following World War II.. History Until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, the manor of Padstow, within which was later established the manor of Prideaux Place, was held by Bodmin Priory. Having foreseen King Henry VIII's intention to dissolve religious houses, Prior Thomas Mundey, a son of Sir John Mundy (died 1537) Lord Mayor of London in 1522, made plans to place the assets of his priory beyond the king's reach, which he did by granting to his friends and relations at nominal ground-rents long leases of the priory's possessions. The manor of Padstow he leased for 99 years at an annual rent of £10 to his niece Johanna Munday and her husband, William Prideaux (died 1564) of Trevose, St Merryn, Cornwall, a younger son of Humphrey Prideaux (1487–1550) of Theuborough, the latter who together with his lawyer brother Nicholas Prideaux (died 1560), had acted as business adviser to the prior. Bodmin Priory was surrendered to the crown by the prior in 1539. The freehold of Padstow was obtained by Nicholas Prideaux (died 1560), by the artificial transaction of William Prideaux (died 1564) conveying the lease to a third party, John Pope of London, for the sum of £1,550, who then obtained a royal licence to alienate it to Nicholas Prideaux (died 1560), for sum unstated in the deed of sale.The Acorn Archive, The Acquisition of Place, Padstow, Cornwall By tradition it is said that the Prideaux family viewed their obtaining of the estate at a favourable price as compensation for \\"an unpleasant wife\\", namely the prior's niece. =Prideaux= Arms of PrideauxBlazoned as Argent, a chevron sable in chief a label of three points gules in The Prideaux family is believed to be of Norman origin and to have first settled in England at some time after the Norman Conquest of 1066 at Prideaux Castle, near Fowey, in Cornwall. It abandoned that seat and moved to Devon, where it spread out in various branches. ;William Prideaux (died 1564) of Trevose, St Meryn, Cornwall :On 20 October 1537 he received a 99-year lease of the manor of Padstow from his father-in-law Thomas Munday, the last Prior of Bodmin. He was the second son of Humphrey Prideaux (1487–1550) of Theuborough in the parish of Sutcombe, by his first wife Joane Fowell, daughter of Richard Fowell of Fowell's Combe. His father had acquired for him the marriage of Johanna Munday (died 1561), daughter of John Munday of Rialton, the niece of the last Prior of Bodmin, Thomas Mundey, and he married Johanna Munday in 1537. The couple resided at Trevose for as yet no grand manor house existed at Padstow. His son John Prideaux (born 1547) received a lease in 1583 of premises in Padstow from Oliver Polwhele, and his own son John Prideaux (died 1633) was buried in Padstow. The paternal estate of Theuborough was inherited by William's eldest brother Richard Prideaux (1520–1603), of Theuborough. ;Nicholas Prideaux (died 1560) :Uncle of William Prideaux (died 1564), obtained the freehold of the manor of Padstow, together with the remainder of the 99-year lease, which his nephew William had sold to a third party, perhaps as a related transaction. He also acquired the estate of Soldon near Holsworthy in Devon. He died childless and selected as his heir his nephew Roger Prideaux (died 1582) of Soldon, the younger brother of William Prideaux (died 1564), the former leaseholder of Padstow. ;Roger Prideaux (c.1524–1582) :Third son of Humphrey Prideaux (1487–1550) of Theuborough. He was Member of Parliament for Totnes in Devon in 1545 and 1547.History of Parliament biography of Roger Prideaux (died 1582) He served as Escheator of Devon and Cornwall in 1550 and as Sheriff of Devon in 1577. He purchased lands in Devon and Dorset, the manor of Launcells in Cornwall, and other properties in Essex, Devon and Somerset. He married Phillippa Yorke (died 1597), daughter of Richard (or Roger) Yorke, Serjeant-at-Law. ;Sir Nicholas Prideaux (1550–1627) :Eldest son and heir, MP for Camelford 1571History of Parliament biography of Nicholas Prideaux (1550–1627) and Sheriff of Cornwall in 1605. He inherited from his father the manors of Padstow, and the Devon manors of Holsworthy, Chesworthy, as well as his seat of Solden, in Holsworthy. He married twice, firstly to Thomasine Henscott and secondly in 1576 he married Cheston Viell (died 1610), 2nd daughter and co- heiress of William Viell of St Breock in Cornwall. He built the present mansion house at Prideaux Place in 1592, and moved his residence there after 1600 when he granted Solden to his eldest son Humphrey on the latter's marriage to Honor Fortescue. Prideaux Place was built just above the fishing- port village of Padstow and in about 1602 the historian of Cornwall Richard Carew wrote: :His younger brother was Sir Edmund Prideaux, 1st Baronet (died 1628), who also built a new mansion for himself, at Netherton, Farway in Devon, where his family was seated until 1875. ;John Prideaux (1583–1649) :Second son, who inherited Prideaux Place, whilst Soldon was inherited by his elder half-brother Humphrey Prideaux. John married Anne Moyle, but died childless, when Prideaux Place was inherited by his half-nephew Edmund Prideaux (died 1683), Sheriff of Cornwall in 1664, third son of his elder half-brother Humphrey Prideaux by his wife Honor Fortescue. ;Edmund Prideaux (1606–1683) :MP for Saltash in the Third Protectorate Parliament of January 1659 and Sheriff of Cornwall in 1664. He was the third son of Humphrey Prideaux of Soldon by his wife Honor Fortescue. He inherited Prideaux place from his childless half-uncle John Prideaux (1583–1649). During the Civil War he supported the Parliamentarians, and after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 his return to royal favour may have been due to the fact that his sister Elizabeth Prideaux was the wife of Sir William Morice (1602–1676) of Werrington, Devon, Secretary of State to King Charles II. 43 letters between Edmund Prideaux and Morrice survive in the library at Prideaux Place. His mother Honor Fortescue is said by tradition to have jumped to her death from the staircase at Prideaux Place, and her ghost, known as \\"The Green Lady\\" is said to remain at the house. He married Bridget Moyle. His third son was Very Rev. Humphrey Prideaux (1648–1724), Dean of Norwich, whose son Edmund Prideaux (1693–1745) eventually inherited Prideaux Place. ;John Prideaux :Eldest son, who married Anne Mallock. ;Edmund Prideaux (died 1728) :Eldest son, who died childless.

Humphrey Prideaux (1648–1724), Dean of Norwich, by his wife Bridget Bokenham (died 1700). He was brought up in Norfolk, and in 1728, inherited Prideaux Place from his childless first cousin Edmund Prideaux. He was a connoiseur of art and architecture and went on a grand tour of Italy late in life. He visited many of the great country houses of Devon, Cornwall, Norfolk and elsewhere and made architectural drawings of them, which today are preserved at Prideaux Place. Amongst his drawings are several of Prideaux Place, of Netherton, the seat of his cousins, and of Stowe House, Kilkhampton, in Cornwall, seat of the Grenville Earls of Bath. When Stowe was demolished in the 1720s, it was probably Edmund Prideaux who purchased many of the fittings and installed them at Prideaux Place, where he carried out substantial re-modelling. The present cantilevered staircase in the hall and the wood-panelled \\"Grenville Room\\" (or Reading Room) both came from Stowe House at that time. In 1717 he married Hannah Wrench (1697–1726), daughter of Sir Benjamin Wrench of the City of Norwich. She died 2 February 1726, aged 29 years, two years before her husband inherited Prideaux Place. ;Humphrey Prideaux (born 1719) :Sheriff of Cornwall in 1750. His second wife was Jenny Pleydell, daughter of Neville Morton Pleydell of Shitterton by his wife Betty Brune, only daughter and sole heiress of Charles Brune of Plumber in the parish of Sturminster Newton, Dorset.

The name Electric Angels was taken from an early Candy demo. After one year, the band relocated to New York City and were signed to Atlantic Records within five months. One of their first New York shows was opening up for the British band Dogs D'Amour and Mother Love Bone (featuring Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard who would form Pearl Jam after the death of lead singer Andrew Wood). The band was originally managed by guitarist Bruce Kulick of KISS fame who also produced a demo for the band. One of the band's original unreleased songs, \\"Put the 'EX' in Sex\\" had conveniently become the title of a later KISS song. Jon Bon Jovi was a fan of the band. Bon Jovi's song, \\"Bed of Roses, Bed of Nails\\" was a tribute to the Angel's \\"True Love and Other Fairy Tales\\" which included the lyrics, \\"...our bed of roses has become a bed of nails\\". A blond backstage at an Angels show at Club Bene in Sayerville, New Jersey said to Bon Jovi, \\"Oh my god, you look just like Jon Bon Jovi.\\" Bon Jovi contributed an endorsement statement to the promotional tape for Atlantic Record's, \\"Electric Angels.\\" Their self-titled debut was recorded in London in the autumn of 1989 by David Bowie and T.Rex producer Tony Visconti and released in February 1990. They were reviewed favorably as a cross between The Replacements and Hanoi Rocks. \\"The Drinking Song\\" from the debut album had a long run as New Jersey's WSOU's (Seton Hall college) third most played song. The first single from their album, \\"Rattlesnake Kisses\\", featured actress Christina Applegate in the video. The band cited their musical influences including KISS, The Ramones, The Replacements, Rick Springfield and George Jones and toured with New Jersey rockers Danger Danger, former Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley and Phoenix rockers Icon (band). Amongst the Angel's biggest fans are the Tattooed Angels, known for their lovely dispositions as well as sporting Electric Angels purple, red and black Coat of Arms tattoos. Home demos were made for early song ideas, though a second album was only in the infancy stages. These demos have erroneously turned up as the never-released second album, which was to be called New York Times, though against the band's wishes or approval. The band let their contract with Atlantic expire in 1991 due to poor promotion on the part of the label and the album was shelved. The second Electric Angels album was finally released in early 2017 on the Demon Doll label as a \\"Limited Addiction\\" release called \\"Lost in the Atlantic\\", a play on the name of their former record company. Notably left off was \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\", a live favorite from the time, and the ballad \\"Can\`t Stand Loving You\\". The band broke up in April 1992 when Roxie returned to Los Angeles to become the guitarist on Gilby Clarke´s solo albums for Slash's Snakepit and later in 1996 Alice Cooper. Roxie later moved to Stockholm, Sweden. Shane, Jonathan, and John returned a few years later, sans guitarist Ryan Roxie who was replaced by Richard Tressan and with the addition of John Ceparano, as The Loveless, self- releasing A Tale Of Gin And Salvation in 1995. Later Shane released a solo record called \\"Blue Movie\\". Another Jonathan Daniel project was the Bellaires, who carried the badge, \\"Three men, three chords, three songs\\". The three song set consisted of two Daniels tunes and a Ceprarano tune. The tunes were \\"My Tattooed Angel (from punk rock heaven)\\", \\"Movin' On\\" (Ceparano) and \\"Stupid Motherer\\". The later song title and lyric was changed to \\"Stupid Futhermucker\\" for demo purposes. John \\"the Hawk\\" Schubert was the drummer. The Electric Angels, again without Roxie, reunited in early 2000 for a one-off radio program appearance on WDHA's The Tour Bus.

Crazy 4 U became a milestone in Kumi's growth as an artist, with her enjoying the theme and beginning to choose the songs she would perform. \\"Crazy 4 U\\" was the opening theme of the Japanese anime series Gilgamesh.

The organization was based in Moscow. History =Beginning= Following the October Revolution control over radio resources was given to the People’s Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs. Then, in 1924 it was transferred to a joint-stock company whose members were the Russian Telegraph Agency, a major electric factory, and the PCPT,10 but in 1928 was returned to the People’s Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs. The first All-Union Radio station, was opened upon Lenin's initiative (for a \\"paperless newspaper\\" as the best means of public information) in November 1924. On November 23, 1924 the first regular broadcast was produced in Moscow on the Comintern radio station, using the Shukhov radio tower. In 1925, the Radio Commission of the Central Committee of the RCP(B) was organized for overall supervision of radio broadcasting. On 30 October 1930, from Tiraspol, MASSR, started broadcasting in the Romanian language a Soviet station of 4 kW whose main purpose was the anti-Romanian propaganda to Bessarabia between Prut and Dniester.Rodica Mahu, Radio Moldova se revendica de la Radio Tiraspol In the context in which a new radio mast, M. Gorky, built in 1936 in Tiraspol, allowed a greater coverage of the territory of Moldova, the Romanian state broadcaster started in 1937 to build Radio Basarabia, to counter Soviet propaganda.Radiofonie românească: Radio Basarabia When the Cold War started, Americans launched the station Radio Free Europe while Western broadcasts were launched in the Eastern bloc. =Radio jamming= Beginning in 1948, the USSR made use of radio jamming to prevent its citizens from listening to political broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America (VOA) and other western radio programs.George W. Woodard, \\"Cold War Radio Jamming,\\" in A. Ross Johnson and R. Eugene Parta (eds.), Cold War Broadcasting: Impact on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Budapest: Central European University Press, 2010, pg. 53. Over time this initial effort was escalated dramatically, with the approximately 200 jamming stations with a total between 3 and 4 megawatts of output power in 1952 expanded to about 1,700 transmitters with a combined 45 megawatts of output power. By this latter date, the list of jammed foreign broadcasts had been expanded to include not only the successors to the BBC and VOA, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, but also Deutsche Welle, Radio Vatican, Kol Israel, and others. Total electricity consumed in the course of this jamming operation has been valued at tens of millions of dollars annually, exclusive of site construction and personnel costs. Jamming was initially attempted by means of superimposed random speech which mimicked station interference.Woodard, \\"Cold War Radio Jamming,\\" pg. 64. Due to the ineffectiveness of this method, however, a move was later made to the generation of random noise to obscure human speech. From the early 1970s, satellites generating swinging carrier signals were used to interfere even more effectively. Nevertheless, people continued (or attempted) to listen to Western broadcasts. In fact, there was even no jamming of these signals (excluding Radio Free Europe) at all, from 1963-1968, and from 1973-1980. In 1963, a further attempt was made to draw USSR radio listeners from western broadcasts by launching a radio station favouring Moscow city and oblast. The jamming stopped in 1988 (Radio Free Europe was, however, unblocked in August 1991). =Collapse of the USSR= As the USSR began to fall in the 1980s, the radio organisation of the USSR began to shut down as private services were introduced and the USSR's stations were relaunched and refocused.

Programming Roj TV broadcast from Denmark and had some office and studio facilities in Belgium. The channel transmitted on the Eurobird 9A satellite (9 Degrees East) to Europe and the Middle East on 11.843 GHz Vertical - S.Rate 27.500Lyngsat and HellasSat 2 satellite 39 Degrees East on 11512 GHz Horizontal - S.Rate 27.500.kEditor Transmissions on the Hotbird satellite (13 Degrees East) ceased.Lyngsat Programming on Roj TV consisted of news, political discussion programs and cultural programming (particularly music and occasional films) with a small amount of children's, entertainment and educational programming. As well as programming in various Kurdish dialects Roj TV broadcast in Turkish (aimed at both Turks and assimilated Kurds), Zaza, Persian and several other languages spoken in the region. A short weekly English news bulletin was broadcast most Saturday mornings (around 11.30 UK time) and very occasionally films with English subtitles were shown. Roj TV was accessible live through the Internet before it was shut down. Background Kurdish-language programmes were completely forbidden from the media in Turkey from 1925 until 2002 when restrictions were relaxed somewhat. However, during this time Kurdish stations started broadcasting to Turkey via satellite from Europe. Initially there also were several Turkish language commercial satellite broadcasters established in a similar manner in response to the TRT monopoly. However, with the deregulation of broadcasting within Turkey all of these have moved their operations to within Turkey itself, and many of them have now been licensed on terrestrial frequencies. In 2004, the national public broadcaster TRT became the first major broadcaster to broadcast a Kurdish-language programme although initially TRT only broadcast Kurdish programmes once per week, along with a handful of local TV and radio stations. These programmes were initially limited 45 minutes per day (an hour per week on TRT), are heavily censored, must include Turkish sub-titles and should not include children's programmes and any other types of educational programmes. The programmes are mostly focused on Atatürk and Turkish ancient history. In 2008 TRT announced they were planning to launch their own full- time Kurdish-language channel TRT 6 with programming \\"promoting the Turkish Republic and its values as well as to counter the propaganda from the PKK channel Roj TV.\\" On January 1, 2009, TRT 6 was officially opened with a new year's special including Kurdish singers such as Rojin. The channel has been promoted with much fanfare prior to the March 2009 local elections in Turkey, with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan using Kurdish at party rallies in the south east to welcome the channel. Predecessors: MED TV and MEDYA TV MED TV was a London-based international TV whose licence was revoked on April 23, 1999 by British regulators as their broadcasts were judged as 'likely to encourage or incite crime or lead to disorder'. The Independent Television Commission imposed three fines totaling £90,000 on MED TV for three separate breaches of the requirement for due impartiality before the closure. eventually revoking their broadcasting licence amid accusations of bias on the ITC's part.Mark Thomas Info The Guardian BBC When Med TV lost its licence in the UK, MEDYA TV started transmissions from studios in Belgium via a satellite uplink from France on July 30, 1999.Medya TV starts broadcasting MEDYA TV's licence was revoked by the French authorities on February 13, 2004,france- authorities-close-kurdish-tv the French court believed that the station had ties with the PKK;Clandestine Radio Watch #154, March 15, 2004 and the CSA, the French licensing authority, stated that MEDYA TV was a successor to MED- TV, and a French Appeal Court confirmed CSA's decision.Clandestine Radio Watch #153, February 29, 2004 The channel ran an announcement stating that \\"A new channel, Roj TV, will begin broadcasting on the first of the month\\". Roj TV began transmissions from Denmark on March 1, 2004.Clandestine Radio Watch #153, February 29, 2004Clandestine Radio Watch #154, March 15, 2004 Roj TV was banned from broadcasting in Germany by the German Interior Ministry in June 2008 because of the network's alleged ties with the PKK organization. Roj's production company based in Wuppertal was also dissolved.Deutsche Welle: Kurdish broadcaster banned in Germany, June 24, 2008 This ban was temporarily lifted by a German court on 25 February 2010.German court temporarily lifts ban on Roj TV Controversy on Roj TV The Turkish Government claimed the channel was a mouthpiece for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which they regard as a terrorist organization (as do the U.S. and UK) and lobbied the Danish government to revoke Roj TV's broadcasting license. A Turkish Foreign Ministry official stated: \\"We know for sure that Roj TV is part of the PKK, a terrorist organization... [The PKK] is listed as a terrorist organization by the EU. Denmark is a member of the EU, and we would expect that the broadcasting organization of a terrorist group would not be given a free pass.\\" While the station's general manager, Manouchehr Tahsili Zonoozi, an Iranian Kurd, acknowledges that the station maintains contact with the PKK, he characterizes it as an independent Kurdish broadcaster, which is not under the control of the PKK. The Turkish authorities repeatably made formal complaints to the Danish Radio and Television Board regarding Roj TV, but none of the complaints were upheld by the Board, who ruled that the TV channel had not violated any rules over which the Board has regulatory power.Danish Radio and Television Board ruling In 2005 the then Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited Denmark and wanted to give a press conference. In the audience was also a reporter from Roj TV which caused Erdogan to leave the press conference. He hoped Denmark would now take the Turkish demands more seriously and prohibit Roj TV. Denmark did not comply and instead defended press freedom in Denmark. In May 2008 Germany searched the production studios of Roj TV in Wuppertal and Berlin. Following the searches, the Interior Minister declared that Roj TV was a part of the PKK and banned the channel from being active in Germany. As a response Kurds protested in several parts in Europe against the ban of the channel in Germany and the closure of the studios. Roj TV challenged the ban and Germany demanded a resolution by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The CJEU ruled Germany was allowed to ban Roj TV from being present in Germany with offices and production studios, but it could not ban Roj TV from broadcasting into Germany from another country. On 4 March 2010, Belgian police raided several locations including Roj TV's facilities. Belgian prosecutors said the raid was due to \\"very serious evidence that, in a very organised way, youngsters of Kurdish origin were recruited in western Europe, notably in Belgium\\".Belgian police swoop on high-profile Kurds Programming was disrupted for a time but the channel returned to air. In August 2010, Roj TV was formally indicted by the Danish attorney general for violation of Danish anti-terrorism legislation, specifically the rules against \\"promoting terrorist activities\\" of the Kurdish organization PKK.Tv-station tiltales for terror (Danish) However the channel remained on air pending possible court proceedings. In the United States diplomatic cables leak of November 2010, a diplomatic message surfaced that referred to a Turkish representative's claim that, \\"as part of the 2009 POTUS- brokered deal that had overcome Turkish objections to the appointment of Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO Secretary General, Denmark had promised to clarify its legal requirements prerequisite to acceding to Turkey's request for the closure of Roj TV\\". On 10 January 2012, a Danish court found the owners of Roj TV guilty of \\"promoting terrorism\\" and fined them 5.2 million Danish kroner ($894,800). The money would be paid in installments of DKK 65,000 for 40 months. The prosecutors claimed that the TV station was \\"financed and controlled\\" by the PKK. On 26 January 2012, Roj TV signed a broadcasting agreement with satellite provider Intelsat. In 2013 Roj TV was shut down in an apparent agreement with Turkey in exchange of the Turkish approval to Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO Secretary General. Soon after Stêrk TV was launched, which also reported about Kurdish cultural and political events.

WTMM-FM assumed the Team format from its former home on 1300 kHz (now WGDJ under new ownership) on December 18, 2006 with the two stations simulcasting until January 2, 2007. History The station signed on the air as WXLEhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/capstar-broadcasting- to-acquire-wxle-fm-in-mechanicville-ny-75913742.html in January 1993. It initially aired a Rock/AC format, known as \\"Rock without the Racket\\" but evolved to an Adult Album Alternative format by late 1993, with live DJs. The station was known as XL-104.5 in those days, and eventually as 104.5 The Zone. As a \\"Triple A\\" station, XL-104.5 was the first station helmed by noted Triple A programmer Zeb Norris. Some other notable air personalities that were on WXLE during this period included original Program Director Bob Welch and market veteran John Clark. In mid-1996 much of its programming became satellite-fed. In 1998, WXLE, was sold to AMFM Inc. and with it came two format changes, first to adult contemporary as Magic 104.5 in October as a smokescreen, then on December 26, to the then-popular \\"Jammin' Oldies\\" format (which AMFM owned the rights to). With the latter switch came the branding of 104.5 The Beat and the calls of WABT.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-01-01.pdf Like other \\"Jammin' Oldies\\" stations, WABT had a short-term uptick in ratings; however, the format did not mesh well with the Albany market and ratings fell to levels of that of the prior formats. When AMFM merged with Clear Channel Communications in 2000, WABT was one of several stations which was divested due to market concentration concerns. After being sold to Regent Communications (now Townsquare Media), WABT's format changed to All-80's Hits as \\"The Buzz\\" on December 8, 2000. The \\"Buzz\\" format was later expanded to include music from the 1990s in September 2002, and evolved to Adult Top 40 in July 2003. In mid-2006, reports began circulating that the Buzz format may move to the relocated 105.7 MHz frequency that previously had been licensed to Queensbury. In the wake of landing the Chuck & Kelly morning show from WYJB in September 2006, these rumors would soon become true. The Buzz format officially moved to 105.7 MHz on December 4, 2006, after spending much of the previous week test simulcasting. On December 18, 2006, WABT flipped to a simulcast of ESPN Radio formatted WTMM as WTMM-FM in preparation of becoming the sole home of that station which took place on January 3, 2007 when WTMM (AM) became female-oriented talk WEEV. The simulcast would partially resume on August 17, 2007, when WEEV returned to the WTMM format and calls, though due to rights issues, it did not clear any of WTMM- FM's play by play; this arrangement ended on November 26, 2007, when the 1300 frequency became home to WGDJ under new ownership.

Ibn Tufail wrote the first Arabic novel, Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, or Philosophus Autodidactus (The Self-Taught Philosopher), as a response to al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the Philosophers. Ibn al-Nafis then wrote his novel Theologus Autodidactus (The Self-Taught Theologian) in response to Ibn Tufail’s work. The protagonists of both these narratives were feral children (Hayy in Philosophus Autodidactus and Kamil in Theologus Autodidactus) who were autodidactic (self-taught) and living in seclusion on a desert island. These works are the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story, Kamil's story extends beyond the desert island setting, developing into the earliest known coming of age plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel.Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), \\"Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher\\", Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis, Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait (cf.

A Latin translation of Philosophus Autodidactus first appeared in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger, followed by an English translation by Simon Ockley in 1708, as well as German and Dutch translations. These translations later inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe, regarded as the first novel in English.Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature, Al-Rashid House for Publication.Cyril Glasse (2001), New Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 202, Rowman Altamira, .Amber Haque (2004), \\"Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists\\", Journal of Religion & Health 43 (4): 357–377 [369].Martin Wainwright, Desert island scripts, The Guardian, 22 March 2003.

Some Sufi traditions are known for their devotional poetry. Arab poetry influenced the rest of Muslim poetry world over. Likewise Persian poetry too shared its influences beyond borders of modern-day Iran particularly in south Asian languages like Urdu Bengali etc.. Genres present in classical Persian poetry vary and are determined by rhyme, which consists of a vowel followed by a single-rhyming letter. The most common form of Persian poetry comes in the ghazal, a love-themed short poem made of seven to twelve verses and composed in the monorhyme scheme. Urdu poetry is known for its richness, multiple genres, traditions of live public performances through Mushairas, Qawwali and Ghazal singing in modern times. Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, the national epic poem of Iran, is a mythical and heroic retelling of Persian history. Amir Arsalan was also a popular mythical Persian story, which has influenced some modern works of fantasy fiction, such as The Heroic Legend of Arslan. Beginning in the 15th century Bengali poetry, originating depicts the themes of internal conflict with the nafs, Islamic cosmology, historical battles, love and existential ideas concerning one’s relationship with society. The historical works of Shah Muhammad Sagir, Alaol, Abdul Hakim, Syed Sultan and Daulat Qazi mixed Bengali folk poetry with Perso-Arabian stories and themes, and are considered an important part of the Muslim culture of Bengal. Ginans are devotional hymns or poems recited by Shia Ismaili Muslims. Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, considered the greatest epic of Italian literature, derived many features of and episodes about the hereafter directly or indirectly from Arabic works on Islamic eschatology: the Hadith and the Kitab al-Miraj (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly beforeIsabelle Heullant-Donat and M.-A.

Although today adab denotes literature generally, in earlier times its meaning included all that a well-informed person had to know in order to pass in society as a cultured and refined individual. This meaning started with the basic idea that adab was the socially accepted ethical and moral quality of an urbane and courteous person'; thus adab can also denote the category of Islamic law dealing with etiquette, or a gesture of greeting.Issa J.

She is portrayed by American actress Lindsay Wagner, who first played the role in the 1970s American television series The Six Million Dollar Man. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she reprised the role in several reunion television films. Jaime Sommers is a former professional tennis star who suffers near-fatal injuries in a sky diving accident. Following cutting-edge surgery, she becomes the first female cyborg. She is assigned to spy missions as an occasional agent of the Office of Scientific Intelligence, while also teaching middle school students at a local airbase.Some dispute exists over whether the OSI stands for Office of Scientific Information or Office of Strategic Intelligence. This version of the name is per several episodes of season one of The Bionic Woman that explicitly spell out what OSI stands for. Spin-off media, however, such as novels and comic books, have tended to use to Strategic Intelligence version. Through the use of cybernetic implants known as bionics, Jaime is given an amplified bionic ear which allows her to detect sounds, at frequencies outside of the human ability to hear, over uncommonly long distances. She also has extraordinary strength in her bionic right arm and both legs, which enable her to run at speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour.Although 60 mph is the most commonly cited running speed for Sommers and Austin, the Bionic Woman episode \\"Winning is Everything\\" shows her unambiguously outrunning a race car going 100 mph (a speedometer is shown on screen). The Six Million Dollar Man also established that Austin was capable of exceeding 60, as well. Jaime is portrayed as the third cyborg, following the astronaut/test pilot Steve Austin and race car driver Barney Hiller (seen in the November 1, 1974, and November 9, 1975, episodes of The Six Million Dollar Man). In the reunion specials, Jaime has become a clinical counselor after retiring from the OSI. She assists Doctor Rudy Wells in training others in the use of their bionics. She trains Austin's son, Michael Austin, and paraplegic Kate Mason to manage their new abilities and counsels them both as a therapist and as someone who faced the same challenges. In 2004, the character was listed in Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters. AOL named her one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters. Cost According to the opening credits of The Bionic Woman, the cost of Jaime Sommers' bionic implants was classified information. This lack of specificity has sparked frequent debates among fans as to whether it is appropriate to call Jaime \\"The Six Million Dollar Woman\\".Some syndicators outside the United States have had fewer problems with this issue. The name of the program in German-speaking countries is The Seven Million Dollar Woman. In Dutch-speaking countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, the show is The Six Million Dollar Woman. The scripts reveal only a few contradictory clues. In the spin-off's opening story \\"Welcome Home, Jaime\\", she suggests to Oscar that she must have cost as much as Steve. He replies, \\"Well, not quite. The parts are smaller, after all.\\" In a season-one episode, \\"Fly Jaime\\", where Jaime and Dr. Rudy Wells are trapped on a desert island and trying to get some food out of a tin, Rudy says, \\"Make way for my six-million-dollar can opener\\". In February 2016, Lindsay Wagner clarified in an interview with Headlines and Global News why the series that made her a star, unlike her \\"Six Million Dollar\\" counterpart, never revealed the final cost of The Bionic Woman. \\"That was a whole political thing wasn't it?\\" Wagner says. \\"She [Jaime] couldn't cost more than the man! They were going to make it more, but there was this whole political thing with the network because it was the beginning of the feminine revolution\\". Thus, ultimately the cost of Jaime Sommers' bionic implants was never revealed and deemed classified information in the opening credits.‘The Bionic Woman’: Lindsay Wagner On New Series, Her Latest Movie And Which New Super Show She’d Love To Appear On, Feb 12, 2016 Character history =Before bionics= Born on August 18, 1948,Season three, episode 22 - \\"On The Run\\": A wanted poster for Jaime lists her as 29 years old and her date of birth as being August 18, 1948. Jaime is the daughter of James and Ann Sommers. Jaime was raised in Ojai, California, and she showed high potential in tennis. Her parents were college political-science professors. Unbeknownst to Jaime, they also worked undercover for the United States government. Both were killed (presumably murdered) in a car accident on April 16, 1966. Long- time family friends Jim and Helen Elgin became the 17-year-old Jaime's legal guardians. Helen's son, Steve Austin, and she became high school sweethearts, but he left Ojai to go to college and later to join the U.S. Air Force, and the NASA space program as an astronaut. Jaime graduated from high school and went on to study education at Carnegie Tech.The reference to \\"Carnegie Tech\\", drawn from dialogue in \\"Welcome Home, Jaime\\", is somewhat suspect. Given that Jaime would have likely started her postsecondary education no earlier than 1967's merger of Carnegie Tech with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, it is probably safe to say she was speaking colloquially, not precisely. If we are to believe that she was referring to a real-life university, her degree would have come from Carnegie Mellon University. Tennis—and not education—was her first career. After receiving her teaching degree, Jaime became a professional tennis player. By 1975, she had won many major tournaments and was ranked among the top-five female tennis players in the world. According to the pilot, \\"Welcome Home, Jaime\\", she has both beaten—and been beaten by—the real-life tennis stars Billie Jean King and Chris Evert. =Accident= On a visit home to Ojai, Jaime is reunited with Steve Austin (now a colonel and former astronaut). With some matchmaking from Steve's mother, Jaime and Steve's relationship quickly blossoms, but their happiness is replaced by tragedy when the couple go skydiving. Jaime's parachute rips, and she plummets to the ground. Her injuries are critical; both legs and her right arm are crushed beyond repair. Severe head trauma also causes damage to her right ear. Steve, who is deeply in love with Jaime, contacts his boss Oscar Goldman at the Office of Strategic Intelligence (OSI) and pleads with him until he authorizes a top-secret procedure—bionic replacement. Steve knows it is the only way to save Jaime, because the government performed the same experimental operation on him two years earlier. Under the skilled hands of Dr. Rudy Wells, Jaime's surgery is a success. Her badly damaged arm, legs, and inner ear are replaced with state-of-the-art electronic prostheses. Upon learning of the radical surgery performed on her, Jaime is fearful of being a freak. However, with Steve's support, she soon learns to accept her new limbs after he reveals that he is bionic, too. As they are in the midst of planning their wedding, Jaime's body rejects her bionics. Emergency surgery is fruitless, and with Steve by her side, Jaime dies on the operating table. =Life after death= Jaime's life does not end here. Dr. Michael Marchetti uses an experimental cryogenic procedure to cool her body and prevent cellular damage. This gives the doctors time to repair the massive cerebral clot which had ended her life. Her heart is restarted, and she is revived. However, the radical operation is not a complete success. Jaime suffers brain damage, and the memories of her past life are lost. Another surgery restores many of her memories, but her love for Steve seems unrecoverable. Jaime's extraordinary strength rules out a return to the tennis circuit, so she returns to Ojai. She moves into a coach house apartment situated on Jim and Helen Elgin's ranch. She lands a job teaching school at the Ventura Air Force Base. Jaime feels indebted to Oscar and the government for saving her life, and she insists that Oscar contact her if the OSI should need an agent with her special abilities. Oscar does call on Jaime, and from 1976 through 1978 she is sent on numerous covert missions. However, Oscar's use of Jaime is considerably more reserved than his use of Steve. Whereas Austin is a full-time agent, Oscar is generally more reluctant to put Jaime into high-risk situations. She is often seen interjecting herself into missions over Oscar's objections. This hesitancy stems from several sources. At least initially, he accepts some of the blame for her death because he sent her out on a mission immediately after her bionic implant operation, using her as an agent before she was really ready. After her rebirth, he is loath to make the same mistake, since, after all, she had died from bionic rejection. Even when resurrected, her memory was not intact. Had she been a regular, non- bionic field agent, her mental issues would have disqualified her from being an agent.The first season episode \\"Jaime's Mother\\" includes another character indicating in dialogue that Jaime suffers from emotional problems, and these issues manifest themselves on several occasions where Jaime exhibits a degree of nervousness and neurotic behavior uncommon in experienced agents. As Jaime and Oscar grow to form a working relationship, he exhibits paternalistic feelings for her which sometimes prevent a detached analysis of her suitability for missions. During her time of most intense involvement with the OSI, her relationship with Rudy Wells is also different from Steve's. Whereas Steve is occasionally distrustful of Rudy, and sometimes shows impatience with, or even hostility to Rudy's medical tests, Jaime views him as a helpful ally from the moment of her resurrection. She is frequently in and around Rudy's lab, and generally more enthusiastic about the research obligations of being a virtually unique specimen. As her experience in the field develops, Jaime herself becomes increasingly self-assured. Her personality is more mercurial than Steve's, at once quick-witted and morally serious. After the trauma of rejection, Jaime's relationship to her bionics remains ambiguous. But as an operative she is courageous, resourceful with her abilities and increasingly circumspect about the militarism of her employers, preferring a more humanistic approach. Late in the series she adopts Maximillion (AKA Max), a German Shepherd dog that had been used as a test case for implanting bionics into animals. Personal life Eventually, Jaime becomes romantically involved with fellow OSI agent Chris Williams, and she yearns for a life of her own away from the government and the constant peril of undercover work. Feeling that she has repaid her debt to the government, Jaime resigns from the OSI. However, the powers that be are not prepared to let her go. Jaime realizes that her bionics have become a permanent part of her life, but they do not have to rule her or the life she wants to live. She returns to the OSI and agrees to take occasional missions on the condition that she is free to pursue her life.It is not altogether clear how, exactly, this arrangement was different from the one she enjoyed during the majority of the run of The Bionic Woman. Oscar had generally treated her as an occasional agent, and often blocked her from helping on missions, even when she insisted on participating. In many ways, it was merely a reiteration of a situation that already existed. Jaime and Chris continue their relationship and become very happy together. After years away from the OSI, Jaime accepts a mission. She travels to Budapest with Chris, but the two of them are separated. After Jaime is caught in an explosion, she is rescued and hospitalized back in the US. When she recovers from the concussion, she starts to remember her past life and feelings for Steve. She also learns the shocking news that Chris had been held captive and killed. She acts on neither of these revelations, but instead returns to her life working as a therapist at the Los Angeles Rehabilitation Center. In 1987, after nearly 10 years with no contact, Jaime unexpectedly reunites with Steve Austin. Steve had left the OSI and had been enjoying life away from the government by running a charter boat. They meet in a restaurant where Steve was meeting his estranged son. Trying desperately to avoid being seen by him, she nevertheless is confronted by Steve, who finds himself being thrown through the restaurant window by Jaime. The couple come to terms with their years of separation and decide to see if they could rebuild their relationship. Jaime and Steve occasionally return to the OSI in times of international crisis. Their time together prove that the love they once felt for each other has never died, and in 1989, the couple become engaged. During the five years that follow, Jaime becomes a doctor. She moves to Washington, DC, and establishes a family-counseling practice. Her experience with the government and her top secret clearance also open the door for her to help government agents. A computer virus, however, corrupts Jaime's bionic systems. Dr. Wells informs Steve that \\"she may never be bionic again\\", but Steve's main concern is he wants her alive above all else. She undergoes a major upgrade, which not only increases the power of her bionics, but also gives her night vision. On September 4, 1994, Dr. Jaime Sommers and Col. Steve Austin marry. At the ceremony, Rudy Wells gives Jamie away, and Oscar is Steve's best man. In literature and culture Unlike Steve Austin, Jaime Sommers did not appear in the novel Cyborg, the original story which started the first series. She was entirely a television invention of Kenneth Johnson, a writer of The Six Million Dollar Man, under the supervision of executive producer Harve Bennett. Sommers' only literary appearances to date have been in two novelizations of televised episodes released in the mid-1970s; Caidin had already concluded his series of Cyborg novels by the time her character was established on television. Johnson named Sommers after a water skier he met while producing whale shows at SeaWorld. The name \\"Jaime\\" was predominantly a male name (a derivative of \\"James\\") before the television series began. It is probably not a coincidence that in 1976 the name Jaime became one of the 100 most popular names of the year in every one of the 50 US states. The female name Jamie (a variant spelling) also gained enormous popularity at the same time.See the timeline at Namemapper (Type Jaime or Jamie (female) into the search line). Remake In 2007, NBC launched a reimagined Bionic Woman. Very few elements of the original series were kept, except for the first and last names of the main character. In the remake, Jamie's full name was Jaime Wells Sommers, a homage to the earlier series' character Dr. Rudy Wells. In the series, the new version of the \\"Bionic Woman\\" had the same basic bionic parts as the 1970s model. However, Jaime version 2.0 also received a bionic right eye (a bionic component previously associated with the original Steve Austin). As in the earlier series, Ms. Sommers was not the first bionic person. Her predecessor was the bionic woman Sarah Corvus (played by Katee Sackhoff). NBC aggressively promoted the series Bionic Woman. The weekly remake drew large initial audiences. The series went on hiatus when most of US entertainment was halted due to the 2007–08 writer's strike. The strike, coupled with diminishing ratings, led NBC to cancel the show after production of eight episodes.

In 1993 the Festival was designated as a Resident Company of the Hult Center for the Performing Arts. It established a community music institute in 1995. In 1997 the company shifted from its summer-only festival model and began year-round programming with the foundation of two additional performance initiatives, The American Symphonia and The Emerald City Jazz Kings. The American Symphonia, which was under the artistic direction of conductor James Paul from 1997–2006, was a classical music initiative dedicated specifically to the championship of post-1900 European art music written in the Western Hemisphere. The Emerald City Jazz Kings, founded and directed by trombonist and music scholar Stephen Stone, is a 16–22 member ensemble dedicated to the presentation of American popular music from the 1920s through '50s, with an emphasis on big band jazz, swing, musical theater, and the American standard. In 1998 the company's eclectic August festival named jazz pianist and composer Dick Hyman as its jazz advisor, who joined James Paul at its artistic helm. By 1999 the Festival had added two more performance initiatives to its programming (its Now Hear This Presenting Series and the Twin Rivers Folklife Festival) and, with the continued expansion of its community music school, had begun a search for a building of its own. In July 2002 it moved into the former First Baptist Church in downtown Eugene (a complex of performance, meeting and classroom spaces), which it named \\"The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts\\" in honor of early 20th century Chicago businessman and philanthropist John G. Shedd, the great-grandfather of Festival co-founder and long-time patron and Director of Education, Ginevra Reed Ralph. In 2004 the Festival official changed its name to the name of its building. It is commonly referred to as \\"The Shedd Institute\\" while the building is known simply as \\"The Shedd\\". It added two additional concert initiatives to its cultural service mix (The Magical Moombah, a musical vaudeville for kids directed by Judith \\"Sparky\\" Roberts, and its Shedd Presents series) and began rental of the facility to other regional, cultural and educational programs. Performance programs The Shedd Institute's performance division currently manages five concert series: Oregon Festival of American Music (an August Festival, founded in 1992, dedicated to the classic American Songbook), The Emerald City Jazz Kings (founded in 1997, the Institute's resident jazz and historic popular music ensemble), Shedd Theatricals (founded in 2002 to produce classical musicals and musical comedies from the 1920s to early 1960s), The Magical Moombah (founded in 2001), the Now Hear This cultural presenting series (founded in 2000), and Shedd Presents (founded in 2004). Facilities The Shedd Institute's facility is located on the corner of Broadway and High Street in downtown Eugene. Constructed in 1926, the building formerly housed the First Baptist Church of Eugene. A building has two formal concert halls (the 825-seat Jaqua Concert Hall and the 175-seat Recital Hall), a multi-purpose 250-seat Great Hall, two dance studios, a library, and about 30 other community meeting rooms, classrooms and rehearsal spaces.

Early life Chamberlain was born in Center Harbor, New Hampshire, to Ephraim ChamberlainMassachusetts, Town and Vital Records, 1620-1988 and soon afterward moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where he spent most of his childhood. In 1844, at age 15, he left home without permission to go to Illinois. Two years later he joined the 2nd Illinois Volunteer Regiment and headed to Texas to participate in the Mexican–American War. In San Antonio, Chamberlain joined the regular army and became part of the 1st U.S. Dragoons. He fought at the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847 as well as several other operations in Mexico. In 1849, he was declared a deserter and by 1854 he had returned home to Boston to raise a family. He married Mary Keith on July 4, 1855, and they had three children. By his own account, Chamberlain was also involved in some less savory aspects of the Texas–Mexico border disputes. Most notably, he rode for a time with the infamous Glanton gang under the command of John Glanton, which was contracted by Mexican authorities to track and kill hostile Apaches following the war. The gang became notorious for taking scalps under highly questionable circumstances to claim the bounties, and its members were eventually declared outlaws by the Mexican government. Chamberlain's memoirs regarding this period are the only known primary source attesting to the existence of the Texian known as Judge Holden, Glanton's second-in-command. While Chamberlain and some others escaped, Glanton and a number of his gang were massacred by Yuma Indians near what is now Yuma, Arizona, in April 1850. Civil War During the American Civil War, after being chief of staff to Brigadier General William W. Averell and Lieutenant Colonel of the 1st Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment, Chamberlain commanded Camp Parole at Annapolis, Maryland, for a time and also commanded the 5th Massachusetts Colored Cavalry, an all African- American unit, with the rank of colonel. He was wounded on six occasions during the war.Eicher, John H. and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, p. 169. Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, 2001. . On February 24, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Chamberlain for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from February 24, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 3.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 742 Chamberlain was mustered out of the U.S. Volunteers on September 16, 1865.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 169 Later life After the war, Chamberlain was a warden of state prisons in Massachusetts and Connecticut.Hunt, Roger D. and Brown, Jack R., Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue, p. 206. Gaithersburg, MD: Olde Soldier Books, Inc., 1990. . Settling in Massachusetts with his family, Chamberlain became well-known for his charming paintings, which consist largely of landscapes and battle scenes depicting the Mexican–American War. A large collection is held at the San Jacinto Museum of History. Chamberlain also authored and illustrated a harrowing autobiographical account of his travels during the 1840s, especially his service in the Mexican–American War and his adventures with the Glanton gang, entitled My Confession: The Recollections of a Rogue, which he wrote between 1855 and 1861. Though many of its stories are exaggerated in the romantic literary style popular at the time, research has corroborated most of them as true. Noted for its authentic descriptions of the experiences of the typical American soldier during the Mexican–American War, Chamberlain's account continues to serve as a valuable primary source text for historians studying the war and the era as a whole. The account also served as the basis for author Cormac McCarthy's 1985 novel Blood Meridian; the novel's protagonist, known only as \\"the kid\\", is said to be loosely based on Chamberlain. Chamberlain died on November 10, 1908 in Worcester, Massachusetts, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery.Goetzmann, William H., CHAMBERLAIN, SAMUEL EMERY, Texas State Historical Association See also *List of Massachusetts generals in the American Civil War *Massachusetts in the American Civil War Notes References *Chamberlain, Samuel E.: My Confession: Recollections of a Rogue; ed.

Initially, he ran the administration jointly with his father Samantasimha, and helped ward off invasions from the Delhi Sultanate. After the Delhi ruler Alauddin Khalji conquered the neighbouring fort of Siwana, Kanhadadeva's armies fought several skirmishes with him. In 1311, Kanhadadeva was defeated and killed in an attack led by Alauddin's general Malik Kamaluddin. He is celebrated as a hero in Kanhadade Prabandha, a 1455 poem by Padmanābha.  Early life  Kanhadadeva was a son of his predecessor Samantasimha. He was also known as \\"Dasam Saligrama\\" and \\"Gokulanatha\\". According to the 17th century chronicler Munhot Nainsi, he had a brother named Maladeva.  Joint administration with Samantasimha  As the heir apparent, Kanhadadeva assisted his father in administration from at least 1296 CE onwards. A 1296 pillar inscription discovered at Topkhana in Jalore states that Kanhadadeva shared the burden of administration during his father's reign. The 1299 CE Chohtan inscription also refers to the joint reign of the father-son duo. No inscription from Kanhadadeva's reign has been discovered, but the last extant inscription from his father's reign is dated 1305. Therefore, Kanhadadeva appears to have ascended the throne sometime around 1305. = Delhi Sultanate's Gujarat campaign = In 1299, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji sent an expedition to Gujarat led by his generals Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan. The Kanhadade Prabandha claims that Kanhadadeva (then a prince) did not permit the Delhi forces to pass through his territory, concerned that they would \\"sack villages, take prisoners, molest women, oppress Brahmanas and slay cows\\". The Khalji army reached Gujarat via another route in Mewar, defeated its king Karna, and ransacked Gujarat. After its victorious campaign in Gujarat, the Delhi army passed through Jalore on its way back to Delhi. According to the 17th century chronicler Muhnot Nainsi's Khyat, the Delhi army encamped at \\"Sakarana\\" near Jalore. The Kanhadade Prabandha names the place as \\"Sirana\\": it can be identified with modern Sankarna. Kanhadadeva sent Kandhala Olecha and four other messengers to the Delhi commander, expressing his displeasure over their stay in his territory, after they had imprisoned Hindus and desecrated the Somanatha temple in Gujarat. These messengers came in contact with the neo- Muslim leader Mammunshah (Muhammad Shah) and his brothers, who were planning a mutiny against the Delhi generals. Three days later, these rebel generals attacked the Delhi army's camp from one side, while Kanhadadeva's army attacked it from the other side. The rebels killed a brother of Nusrat Khan and a nephew of Alauddin, but the mutiny was completely suppressed within 4 days. The Kanhadade Prabandha does not mention any mutiny by the Delhi soldiers, and states that the attack on the Delhi camp was led by Kanhadadeva's minister Jaita Devada. The Delhi chronicles, such as Ziauddin Barani's Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, describe the mutiny, but do not mention any Chahamana participation in the unsuccessful mutiny. Historian Dasharatha Sharma believes that Nainsi's account, which mentions collaboration between Kanhadadeva's forces and the mutineers, is an accurate representation of the conflict. However, Nainsi inaccurately states that Alauddin personally led the Delhi army during this campaign, and that he was present at the time of the mutiny. Therefore, historian Kishori Saran Lal doubts the veracity of Nainsi's account and the claim that the Jalore army aided the mutiny. = Somanatha idol = The Kanhadade Prabandha and Nainsi's Khyat also credit Kanhadadeva with rescuing the Somnath temple idol from desecration by the Delhi army. This claim also occurs in Ranamalla Chhanda (1408-1411) by Shridhara Vyasa. According to these texts, Kanhadadeva's army liberated several Hindu prisoners, and recovered the Somnath idol, which was being taken to Delhi to be desecrated. Kanhadadeva is said to have installed the five fragments of this idol at Prabhas Patan, Bagada, Abu, Jalor and his personal garden. The Kanhadade Prabandha hails him an incarnation of Krishna for this act. However, other sources state that the idol was taken to Delhi; these sources include Amir Khusrau's Khazainul-Futuh, Barani's Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi and Jinaprabha's Vividha-tirtha-kalpa. It is possible that the story of Kanhadadeva's rescue of the Somnath idol is a fabrication by the later writers. Alternatively, it is possible that the Khalji army was taking multiple idols to Delhi, and Kanhadadeva's army retrieved one of them. = Asylum to the rebels = Nainsi's Khyat further claims that Mammushah (Muhammad Shah) and his brother Gabharu, who had rebelled against the Delhi generals, took asylum with Kanhadadeva. However, Kanhadadeva disapproved of their killing of cows (which are sacred to Hindus). Therefore, the two rebels left Jalore, and sought shelter with Hammiradeva at Ranthambore.  Defeat against Alauddin Khalji  { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Jalore\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [72.6253763, 25.344480] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Delhi\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [77.2273958, 28.661898] } } ] } At the beginning of the 14th century, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji captured the forts of Ranthambore (1301) and Chittor (1303), which made him a neighbour of Kanhadadeva. Different medieval writers give different accounts of the events leading up to Alauddin's invasion of Jalore. The 15th century Kanhadade Prabandha claims that Alauddin's daughter Piroja fell in love with Kanhadade's son. Alauddin offered to marry her to the Chahamana prince, stating the couple had also been married in several previous births. He even visited Jalor, where he was treated well because he behaved like a Hindu. However, the Chahamana prince rejected the offer as an insult. The prince was later killed in a battle. His head was brought to Alauddin, but it miraculously turned away when the Sultan turned towards it. Princess Piroja, who loved the Chahamana prince, immolated herself while holding his head. The text names the Siwana ruler Sataladeva (Sitaladeva) as Kanhadadeva's general and nephew. It claims that when the Delhi army invaded the Chahamana kingdom, Sataladeva raided their camp at Mandore. The Khaljis next invaded the Siwana fort, but Sataladeva repulsed them with help of an army sent by Kanhaddeva. The invaders lost their commanders Nahar Malik and Khandadhara Bhoja in this battle. Alauddin later personally led an army to Siwana, and defeated Sataladeva. Following this victory, Alauddin's generals started ransacking the neighbouring territory, bringing them into conflict with Kanhadadeva's forces. According to the 16th century Tarikh-i-Firishta, Alauddin sent an army to besiege Jalore in 1305. Samantasimha was probably dead by this time, and Kanhaddeva had become the sole ruler of the kingdom. The Khalji commander Ain- ul-Mulk Multani convinced Kalhanadeva to visit Delhi and to become an ally of the Khaljis. Kanhadadeva visited Delhi, but he was not satisfied with the terms offered to him, and returned to Jalore. A few years later, Kanhadadeva heard Alauddin boasting that no Hindu ruler could challenge him. This rekindled Kanhadadeva's sense of pride, and he decided to fight with Alauddin, resulting in an invasion of Jalore. This narrative is also repeated by the 17th century historian Hajiuddabir. The 17th century writer Munhot Nainsi does not mention Kanhadadeva's visit to Delhi, but states that his son Viramadeva stayed at the court of Delhi for some time. Once, Alauddin offered to marry his daughter to Viramadeva. The Chahamana prince did not want to marry the Khalji princess, but could not openly refuse the offer. He asked for Alauddin's permission to return to Jalore, promising to return with a marriage party. When he did not return, Alauddin sent a 500,000-strong force to Jalor. This force, led by Mudfar (Muzaffar) Khan and Dauda Khan, besieged the Jalor fort for 12 years. None of these accounts are historically reliable. By 1310, Alauddin had subjugated the kingdoms surrounding Jalore, including Gujarat, Malwa, Chittor, Ranthambore and Siwana. It appears that he attacked Jalore simply because he wanted to put an end to Jalore's independent status. The forces sent by Alauddin against Jalore initially failed to capture the fort. In 1311, Alauddin dispatched a stronger army led by Malik Kamaluddin Gurg, which defeated and killed Kanhadadeva. Nainsi's Khyat suggests that many people believed that Kanhadadeva managed to survive and disappeared. His son Viramadeva is said to have died 2.5 days after the coronation.  Legacy  Kanhadadeva is eulogized as \\"Kanhadade\\" in Kanhadade Prabandha (1455), an epic authored by Padmanabha, who was a court poet employed by the later rulers Jalore. The text is written in Prakrit language with Old Rajasthani and some Gujarati influences. It mentions Kanhadade as a Rajput king and describes his struggles against Alauddin Khalji, the Sultan of Delhi. The text demonizes Muslims, and hails Kanhadade as a saviour who defeated the Muslims responsible for desecrating the Somnath temple.

It is an older method of measuring frequency, widely used from the birth of radio in the early 20th century until the 1970s, when the development of inexpensive frequency counters, which have far greater accuracy, made it largely obsolete. A wavemeter consists of an adjustable resonant circuit calibrated in frequency, with a meter or other means to measure the voltage or current in the circuit. When adjusted to resonance with the unknown frequency, the resonant circuit absorbs energy, which is indicated by a dip on the meter. Then the frequency can be read from the dial. Wavemeters are used for frequency measurements that do not require high accuracy, such as checking that a radio transmitter is operating within its correct frequency band, or checking for harmonics in the output. Many radio amateurs keep them as a simple way to check their output frequency. Similar devices can be made for detection of mobile phones. As an alternative, a dip meter can be used. There are two categories of wavemeters: transmission wavemeters, which have an input and an output port and are inserted into the signal path, or absorption wavemeters, which are loosely coupled to the radio frequency source and absorb energy from it.  HF and VHF  A Triplet 3256 wavemeter for use in the high frequency band. The most simple form of the device is a variable capacitor with a coil wired across its terminals. Attached to one the terminals of the LC circuit is a diode, then between the end of the diode not wired to the LC circuit and the terminal of the LC circuit not bearing the diode is wired a ceramic decoupling capacitor. Finally a galvanometer is wired to the terminals of the decoupling capacitor. The device will be sensitive to strong sources of radiowaves at the frequency at which the LC circuit is resonant. This is given by f = {1 \\\\over 2 \\\\pi \\\\sqrt {LC}} When the device is exposed to an RF field which is at the resonant frequency a DC voltage will appear on the terminals on the left hand side. The coil is often outside the case of the unit so it can be brought close to the object being probed.  UHF and SHF  Resonant cavity wavemeter for measuring microwave frequencies in the Ku band At the higher frequencies it is not possible to use lumped components for the tuned circuit. Instead methods such as stripline or resonant cavities are used. One design for ultra high frequencies (UHF) and super high frequencies (SHF) is a resonant λ/4 (quarter wave) rod which can vary in length. Another design for X-band (10 GHz) is a resonant cavity which can be changed in length. As an alternative for UHF, Lecher transmission lines can be used. It is possible to measure roughly the frequency of a transmitter using Lecher lines.

Welayah is a word which a power gives authority/guardianship to a person, community, or country that is under the direction and rule on behalf of another. \\"Wali\\" is someone who has \\"Walayah\\" (authority or guardianship) over somebody else. For example, in fiqh, a father is wali of his children. The word Wali holds a special importance in Islamic spiritual life and it is used with various meanings, which relate to its different functions, which include: “next of kin, ally, friend, helper, guardian, patron, and saint”. In Islam, the phrase walīyu l-Lāh\\"Walī (a., pl. awliyā;)\\" can be used to denote one vested with the \\"authority of God\\": > > \\"In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate: Only God is your wali > and his messenger and those who believe, establish worship, and pay the poor > due while bowing down (in prayer).\\" Terminology Two nouns are derived from the root W-L-Y : walayah and wilayah, which means to be near to something, to be a friend of someone or to have power. The term welayah also has similarity with AWLIA. The term Wali derives from Quran. It occurs also in a number of hadith qudsi, such as “whoever harms a friend (walī) of Mine, I declare war against him and others\\". Welayah means literally \\"nearness\\" or \\" closeness\\" in which there is judgmental nearness on slavery. Also it means that being dependent of slave to Truth or God in annihilating. The welayah in the Sharia is the implementation of saying to others either will or not will. Arab lexicographers and semanticists distinguish between the words \\"wilayah\\" and \\"walayah.\\" According to that, walayah sometimes represent the sense of assistance, alliance or nusrah, while wilayah invariably denotes the idea of power, authority or sultan. The concept of Walayah There are several kinds of Walayah: Wila of love or nearness which implies that the household of the prophet are his near relatives and the believers should love them. Awliya Allah means the friends of Allah or the beloved of Allah. Walaya is a key word in Shi‘ism that refers among other things to the nature and function of the Imamate. According to Hamid Algar, the first definition of wali was provided by Abu’l-Qāsem Qošayrī (d. 467/1074-75), who said that wali has two kind of meanings: passive and active. Wali as passive designates one whose affairs are completely guided by God the exalted. Wali as active designates one who takes it on himself to worship God and obey him. On the other hand, some mystics, such as Najm-al-dīn Dāya, define welayah according to the concept of love and friendship. Also we can find out the other meaning for wali as \\"closeness\\" which means \\"one who is close.\\" A wali is an elected man among believers for the sake of his spiritual proximity to God Almighty. Also, walayah has a close relation to imamate; in other words there is inseparable linkage between imamiyyah (belief in the imamate) and walayah, which included five pillars such as love and devotion to the people of the household of the Prophet or Imams, following them in religion, obedience to their commands and abstention from what they prohibited, imitation of their actions and conduct, and recognition of their rights and belief in their imamate. Wila of leadership or authority over religious matters, such a position needs Ismah and the speech and deed of the leader is an example for others as is regarded in verses 33:21, 3:31. and whatever he says is a divine proof.Imams or Awliya all make up the long chain of the Friends of God who carry and transmit the divine Covenant or welayah. According to an esoteric interpretation, during the World of the Pact ('âlam* al-mîthâq) — a world with the \\"pure beings\\" in the form of particles or shadows — we can see four oaths, including oaths of love and fidelity (walâya) toward Muhammad and his prophetic mission toward the Imams and their sacred Cause, and also toward the Mahdi as universal savior at the end of the world. Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi believes that it is the very term of welayah that denotes the ontological-theological status of the Imam. It is said that walâya has a quite simple translation along with two independent and complementary meanings. First it applies to the Imams of different prophets and also refers to their ontological status or their sacred initiatory mission. The second meaning is the \\"chief,\\" the master of believers par excellence. In this interpretation, walî is a synonym of wasî, \\"the inheritor\\" or \\"the heir.\\" According to second meaning, walaya applied to the faithful of the Imams. It also denotes the unfailing love, faith, and submission that the initiated owe to their holy initiating guide. The Shia believe that every great prophet is accompanied by one or more Imams in his mission. =Walayah of socio-political leadership= Spiritual Walayah which concerns changing the potentials to the action and making the people to get to the divine nearness, therefore there is a proof in every age. The Wali has a kind of creative power over the world and the men. Corbin states that Walayah is the foundation of the prophecy and the mission of the messenger. And it concerns to the esoteric dimension of the prophetic reality. Abu al-Hasan Sharif Isfahani, a student of Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, by many hadith argues that \\"the walayah is the inner, esoteric meaning (batin) of the Qur'anic Revelation.\\". Mulla Sadra states that the genealogical descendants of Muhammad and his spiritual heirs are Awliya. Dakake describes Walayah as a spiritual inheritance, esoteric knowledge, that Imams inherit from the prophets. Which expresses the spiritual and political authority of ahl al-Bayt. Tabatabaei regards that Walayah is the esoteric dimension of the Imamah and it is not just guiding the man, but it is conveying the man to the Truth. Argument =By Quran= By verse 42:23 and hadith of Ghadir, the prophet called the Muslims to love his pure, sinless family. Al-Tabari, Az-Zamakhshari and Fakhru'd-Din ar-Razi state that verse 5:55 is revealed about Ali. The verse implies that Allah and His prophet is the Wali and the holders of the authority of the Muslims and the believers must accept their Wila. This bond of love further causes that the Muslims follow their speeches, deeds, behaviors. In Quran, the term walayah is used in conjunction with nusrah and it is not only used in relation to God but also is used for those who have perfect devotion to God. Some traditions state that the verse 7:172 deals with the primordial pact (mithaq) that God has taken for His Lordship and the Walayah to the prophet and the ahl al-Bayt. In the Quran, the term shows a link between faithfulness to God and devotion to the members of the community. Tabatabaei claims that wherever Quran ascribes the guardianship for the prophet, it means authority and devotion. By the verse 5:55, he claims that as the word Walayah once is used for Allah and His messenger and those who have believed, though they are under His Guardianship and at last he proves that the prophet's obedience is God's obedience. =By hadith= Ar-Razi quotes from az-Zamakhshari that the Prophet said: \\"Who so ever died in the love of the Household of Muhammad has died a martyr; Whosoever died in the love of the Household of Muhammad has died in forgiveness; Whosoever died in the love of the Household of Muhammad has died a believer and in the perfection of his faith. Whosoever dies in enmity to the family of Muhammad, dies an nbeliever. Whosoever dies in enmity of the family of Muhammad,will not smell the scent of Paradise.\\" A hadith al-Baqir narrates that \\"Islam is built upon five: prayer, alms-giving, fasting, pilgrimage, and walayah; and not one of them was proclaimed, the way walayah was proclaimed. Hasan ibn Ali narrates that after professing tawhid and the mission of the prophets, nothing is more important than professing to the Walayah of Imams. Ja'far al-Sadiq told that Imam separates the people of the Heaven from the Hell, without any judgement, because their love for the Imam is their Heaven or Hell respectively. The prophet tells Ali that he heard Allah say to him: \\"I wrote thy name and his name on My Throne before creating the creatures because of my love of you both. Whoever loves you and takes you as friends numbers among those drawn-nigh to Me. Whoever rejects your walayah and separates himself from you numbers among the impious transgressors against Me.\\".\\" Al- Baqir states that \\"...There was never a prophet nor an angel who did not profess the religion of our love.\\" =Theological and philosophical argument= In Shia tradition, walayah is not only one of the pillars of Islam; it is the religion itself. For Shia, Imamah is bound with the Walayah which is believing their Imamate and loving them, following and obeying them in religion and in their deeds. Shia argue that the salvation is in the practice of the Walayah to the ahl al-Bayt. and an intention of love is required for the acceptance of every religious act. Many hadith by Imams narrate that \\"the first thing about which a man is questioned after his death is his love for ahl al-Bayt. If he has professed this love (walayah) and died professing it, then his deeds are acceptable to Allah. If he has not professed this love, then none of his works will be capable of being accepted by Allah.\\" Muhammad Baqir Majlisi states that all Imamis agree that deeds without love to Imams are empty formality and Allah's approval is conditioned to Imam. The ʾUlu al-ʿAzm got this title by accepting the Walayah of the prophet and the Imams and Mahdi. The prophet established the religion and Imams are to preserve the religion and to lead the people by the divine guidance (walayah) which they inherited through the prophet. A hadith narrates, \\"He who knows himself knows his Lord\\", but without theophanic form (mazhar) and the Face of Allah, through whom Allah displays Himself, even to speak of Allah is impossible. Without the knowledge of Allah and Divine revelation, man will be trapped in ta'til (anthropomorphism) and tashbih (agnosticism). According to Shia the end of the prophecy was the beginning of Walayah which is its esoteric dimension and complementary. Walayah embraces both the idea of knowledge (Ma'rifah) and the idea of love (Mahabbah). While prophecy is the exoteric (zahir) dimension of religion, Walayah is its esoteric (batin) dimension; they are simultaneous. Walayah is the esoteric dimension of Shariah which renews the man and the religion spiritually in all the times and purifies the society without any need to a new religion. Wali carries the Muhammadan Light which has existed in all the prophets. By this Muhammadan Light, Imam leads over the society, propagates the religion and guides the spiritual life of the men. Shi'ites believe that the cycle of the prophecy is succeeded by the cycle of Imamah which of its essentials is Walayah e.g. \\"the esoteric aspect of prophecy\\". They as the Friends of Allah (awliya' Allah) get the divine secrets through the divine inspiration and on this basis God make them the human Guides. The prophet reveals the shariah (zahir) and Imam brings the haqiqah (batin) of the religion, so the batin is not separate from the zahir. Walayah is the foundation of the prophecy (nubuwah) and the messengership (risalah), so, closer to the inner realities, more sufficient and nearer to God. As Wali is concerned with guiding the spiritual life of the community, his presence in the community is not effective. As all the possible beings are dependent to self-existent, this dependence results on the authority of the self-existent; so Walayah is just his right and he can designate this authority to whom he chooses. History of the concept of Walayah The concept of Walayah is present at the early Shia history which indicates the legitimacy of Alids and an allegiance to ahl al-Bayt. The term derives from a statement of the Prophet at Ghadir Khumm, in which he reportedly designated Ali as the Mawla or Wali of the believers. During the Imamate of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq, the concept of Walayah, as a prerequisite for membership in the Shia community, becomes a fundamental concept in the Shia discourse and is reinterpreted. It implies a state of full devotion to ahl al-Bayt and a recognition of their exclusive right to legitimate leadership of the community. Shia argues that the perfection of the religion depends on the practice of Walayah. Walayah as one of the fundamentals of Islam, deriven from Ghadir Khum traditions by al-Baqir, originates at his time. And it is presented as the essence of the religion in this period. At the Time of al-Sadiq, the focus on the term Walayah changed to Imamah. In this age, the word iman and Walayah is tied. Later on Walayah is replaced by iman. By the First Civil War, It is used side by side with the word enmity (adawah) reflecting the loyalty to the Shia community. There is a problem about definition of walī and his attributes when wali compared to prophet. It seems that the notion of wali was superior to nabi in 3rd/9th. Someones such as Abū Bakr Ḵarrāz(d. 286/899) and following him, Ḥakīm Termeḏī (d. between 295/907 and 310/922) refuted this superiority. They believed that the prophethood has superiority over wali. However they maintained that there are many different categories for welayah. On this occasion, Ḥakīm Termeḏī divided wali into two categories: welāya ʿāmma, which embraces all believers, and welāya ḵāṣṣa, which pertains exclusively to the spiritual elect. Ibn Arabi also refers to a relation between nabi and wali. He believed that although the prophet is indeed superior to wali, nabi is himself a wali besides being prophet. Ibn Arabi also mentioned that the wali-aspect of nabi's being is superior to the nabi-dimension. Syed Ahmad Khan agreed with Ibn Arabi's view and explained it. Ismaili and Druze pillar Walayah or Walayat is a pillar of Shia Islam specifically in Ismaili and Druze denoting: :\\"love and devotion for God, the Prophets, the Imam and the dai.\\". One should have Walayat (guardianship of the faith) on the wali. If someone has been made Wali of yours than have full walayat (guardianship of faith) of him. Dawoodi Bohras believe Walayah to be the most important of the seven pillars of Islam. It is the acceptance of guardian ship of Allah, through their Dai, Imam, Wasi (Wali) Ali and Nabi Muhammad. To accept that Ali is Wali of Allah is doing \\"Walayat\\" of Ali. For Shia \\"Walayat' of Ali ( and his further representative) is a must. There is an incident famous amongst the Dawoodi Bohra which confirms how they interpret the principle of walayah. An order was issued by the 19th Da'i al-Mutlaq, Syedna Idris Imad al-Din, to his Wali al-Hind, Moulai Adam, to follow a person named Sakka. Moulai Adam, along with his followers, willingly performed prayer behind Sakka, who was a simple water carrier by trade. This showed that Adam had full walayah for his Da'i and had willingly accepted his guardianship and followed his order. Wali in the most literal form of the word means \\"a person, community, or country that is under the direction and rule of another.\\" It is an Arabic word derived from the root W-L-Y , which carries the basic meanings of “friendship, assistance”, and “authority or power”. from The word holds a special importance in Islamic spiritual life and it is used with various meanings, which relate to its different functions, which include: “next of kin, ally, friend, helper, guardian, patron, and saint”. The eternal prophetic reality has two aspects: exoteric and esoteric. In its connotation of sainthood, the word describes an innate sense of selflessness and separation from one’s own wants in favor of awareness of being “under the dominion of the all-living, self-subsistent one and of the need to acquire nearness to the necessarily existent being – which is God.”. Individuals that have attained this level are believed to be both favored and live in a state of nearness with God. The first step in sainthood is indicated in the Qur'an verse (2:257): > God is He Who loves, guards and directs those who believe; He has led them > out of all kinds of darkness into the light, and keeps them firm therein. and also in (10:62): > Know well that the confidants (saintly servants) of God-there will be no > reason for them to fear (both in this world and the next, for they shall > always find My help and support with them), nor shall they grieve. One who has been favored with sainthood is called a wali or Waliullah, meaning a saint. Waliullah may also be translated as a word used to describe a certain group of people selected by God from among millions of others to be “His friends” because of their closeness to God. And thus, a saint, or a friend to God, is thought to have favor in the eyes of the Lord. For an individual to achieve walaya, or sainthood, a person must first become, and remain, a pristine example of a truly religious person, an example for all other Muslims to look up to. Upon these individuals, the peace and blessing of God have been placed. In the Qur'an, walaya is expressed in the Sura al-Kahf's fable of the rich but immoral owner of two gardens and his poor but pious companion. The rich man ends up a loser despite his prosperity and power, for ultimately, the walayah belongs to God, the Truth (18:44).

It features the Eighth Doctor, Fitz Kreiner, Compassion, and Romana III, as well as a brief appearance of the Third Doctor in a ghost-like state due to the Faction's manipulation of the Doctor's timeline, and features the last appearance of Faction Paradox in the Eighth Doctor Adventures. In 2000, The Ancestor Cell was placed ninth in the Top 10 of SFXs \\"Best SF/Fantasy novelisation or TV tie-in novel\\" category for that year. Plot Following on from the events of The Banquo Legacy, the Time Lords have cracked the base code the Eighth Doctor programmed into Compassion's randomiser, and intercept her at her next destination. Threatened with enslavement, Compassion activates her built in weapons system and destroys the approaching WarTARDISes, while the Doctor fights for control of her navigation systems. The resulting \\"hiccup\\" expels Fitz and the Doctor into the vortex. The Doctor is captured while escaping from the Edifice, a massive bone structure that has appeared in the skies above Gallifrey, and taken to Gallifrey, where he is accused of being an agent of Faction Paradox. The Doctor is forced to aid the Time Lords in the capture of Compassion to aid in the forthcoming War. Meanwhile, Fitz appears before a group of disenchanted, young Time Lords who are holding rituals based on the occult texts of Faction Paradox and finds himself unable to escape. Getting further embroiled in the group's activities, Fitz witnesses the creation of a copy of former President Greyjan the Sane and is then the unwitting donor of material used to pull the original Fitz Kreiner, now in the guise of Faction Agent Father Kreiner, from a Klein bottle universe into the modern day Gallifrey. During her Reaffirmation Ceremony, Lady President Romana is challenged by Greyjan and placed under house arrest, with only Fitz as company. With the aid of Compassion, they are able to escape and witness Faction Paradox corrupting Time Lord history, followed by the Doctor's fall to the Faction. Travelling to the Edifice with Father Kreiner and a Faction Agent known as Tarra, Kreiner reveals he is not truly working for the Faction and pleads with the Doctor to undo the past so he never becomes Father Kreiner, an act the Doctor cannot agree to. The Doctor reveals that not only has he not fallen to the Faction, but that the Edifice is, in fact, his old TARDIS, which was not actually destroyed at Avalon. Together he and Kreiner are able to dispose of Tarra before Grandfather Paradox appears on the Edifice to confront the Doctor. The Doctor battles the Grandfather, and decides that the only way to prevent Faction Paradox from destroying Gallifrey's past is a drastic move: he chooses to use the energy that is holding the TARDIS together to destroy Faction Paradox and Grandfather Paradox, but also destroy Gallifrey in the process. With the whole of Time Lord history seemingly being erased from existence, Compassion is able to rescue the Doctor, Fitz and the remains of the Doctor's old TARDIS, placing them on Earth for safekeeping, until the TARDIS can regenerate itself over the course of the next century and the Doctor, now suffering from amnesia, can recover. At the end of the novel, the Doctor is stranded on Earth for a hundred years; Fitz is left to his own devices in the late 20th century, with only a time and place to meet the Doctor once the TARDIS is once again active; and Compassion is released from her bonds to both the Time Lords and the Faction, free to roam time and space as she sees fit. Continuity *The reason for the Eighth Doctor's amnesia is explained in The Gallifrey Chronicles. *The images of the Doctor's previous incarnation created by dust motes on the Edifice are that of the Third Doctor, in reference to the original timeline, where the Third Doctor died after returning from Metebelis 3, instead of on Dust (Interference by Lawrence Miles). *This story is where the Doctor Who books and Faction Paradox media continuities diverge. Although there are some attempts to reconcile the two (The Book of The War states that the enemy referred to in this book was not the Enemy, and the Faction that appeared was from a much later time when they were little more than a parody of themselves), it is generally accepted they no longer exist in the same continuity. As another indicator, in the Faction Paradox stories, the homeworld of the Great Houses still exists and the War still rages. * Despite reports to the contrary, \\"The Enemy\\" were never originally planned to be the Daleks. Other books in the series make it clear that the enemy cannot be the Daleks. The confusion arose in relation to a later BBC Books arc, culminating in Sometime Never... (2004), which had been intended to feature the Daleks until legal issues prevented it. Craig Hinton's Past Doctor Adventures novel The Quantum Archangel, depicts a universe where the Daleks are the Enemy, but those events take place in an alternative reality.

His support of the Emperor of Ethiopia during the invasion of Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (also known as Ahmed Gragn), when so many of the local aristocrats had switched their support, helped to preserve the country from extinction. Bahr negus Yeshaq first appears in history about the time the Portuguese fleet arrived at Massawa in 1541. When Christovão da Gama marched inland with his 400 matchlockmen, Yeshaq not only provided him provisions and places to camp in his realm, but also about 500 soldiers and information about the land.As described by Miguel de Castanhoso in his account of the Portuguese expedition (translated in R.S. Whiteway, The Portuguese Expedition to Abyssinia [London: The Hakluyt Society, 1902]). The Bahr negus also joined Emperor Gelawdewos in the decisive Battle of Wayna Daga, where Imam Ahmad was killed and his forces scattered (1543). When the Ottoman general Özdemir Pasha, who had been made governor of the Ottoman province of Habesh, crossed over from Jeddah in 1557 and occupied Massawa, Arqiqo and finally Debarwa, capital of the Bahri negassi, Yeshaq led the great Army of Midre Bahri against the invaders, recapturing Debarwa and seizing the \\"immense treasure\\" the invaders piled up within.Richard Pankhurst, An Introduction to the Economic History of Ethiopia, p. 327. Although Bahr negus Yeshaq enjoyed good relations with Emperor Galawdewos, his relations with his successors were not as positive. In 1560, the year after Menas became emperor, Bahr negus Yeshaq revolted against the new Emperor. While he was successful at first, eventually Menas drove Yeshaq out of Tigray, and the noble was forced to seek refuge at the court of his former enemy. In return for ceding the town of Debarwa, Ozdemur Pasha extended military support to the exiled Bahr negus, and Yeshaq led an army into Tigray and the other northern provinces. Emperor Menas campaigned against the forces of this alliance again in 1562, but was not able to decisively defeat Yeshaq. When Sarsa Dengel was made emperor, Yeshaq at first pledged his loyalty, but within a few years he once more went into rebellion, and found another ally in the ruler of Harar, Sultan Mohammed IV Mansur. Despite these alliances, Emperor Sarsa Dengel defeated and killed Yeshaq in battle (1578).Pankhurst, pp. 327f. Richard Pankhurst concurs with the judgement of James Bruce on Yeshaq, who points out that the status of the Bahr negus \\"was much diminished by Yeshaq's treachery. From then onwards the governor of the provinces beyond the Tekezé was not allowed the sandaq (Banner) and nagarit (War Drum), and no longer had a place in Council unless especially called on by the Emperor\\". This could also mean that the Bahr neguses' kingdom was no longer part of the \\"Empire\\" per se.Pankhurst, p. 328.

It is possible that he was granted the Mormaerdom by a King of Scotland, as suggested by Roberts,Roberts, Lost Kingdoms, p. 48 rather than merely inheriting it. However, this is unlikely. If he did inherit it, he inherited it from his father, Máel Muire. According to the Orkneyinga Saga, Matad was the son of Máel Muire, who was son of king Donnchad I and younger brother of King Máel Coluim III Cenn Mór. It is highly unlikely that the kings of Scotland, with little more claim to the kingship than Matad himself, would have been in a position to \\"grant\\" the Mormaerdom. It is much more likely that Matad inherited part of a deal made with Máel Muire by the king in order to alienate Máel Muire and his descendants from the kingship. Mormaer Matad is most famous for being the father of Harald Maddadsson, or Arailt mac Mataid. He married Margaret, the daughter of Haakon Paulsson (the son of Thorfinn the Mighty). Through this marriage, their son Harald would succeed to the Earldom of Orkney (c. 1139). He is called Maddadr in the Orkneyinga Saga, and some historians follow on from this and call him Maddad. He also features as a witness to charters of the reign of King David I, where he is called Madeth Comes and Maddoc Comes (=Mormaer Matad).Anderson, Early Sources, V.II, p. 139 , n.2 Other names originating from the obvious difficulties encountered by his name are Madach and Maddad.

It is the opposite of najāsa, the state of being ritually impure. It is achieved by first removing physical impurities (for example, urine) from the body, and then removing ritual impurity by means of wudu (usually) or ghusl.  In the Quran The Quran says: and also there is one verse which concerned with Taharah or purity and impurity of Humans:  Importance in Islam  Observing cleanliness of the soul, the clothes, and the surroundings is obligatory upon every Muslim, and this is considered as one of the pillars of Islam. Before offering prayers, it is necessary to perform wudu, and in certain cases, both wudu and ghusl. The purifying agent is always clean water. However, during times when water is not available or is scarce, symbolic wudu and ghusl can be performed with clean dry earth which is known as Tayammum. If the body or clothes show traces of urine, feces, semen or alcohol, then taharah becomes essential. Many juridical opinions add blood and pus to that list. The clothes should be washed and the affected part of the body cleaned with pure water, or the whole body given a ghusl as the case may be. A person must not touch the Quran if the person is not in the state of Tahara. The Quran says: None shall touch it but those who are clean (). When in a state of janaba, one is not allowed even to recite the Quran, let alone touch it. In a state of minor ritual impurity, it is forbidden (in some schools, makruh) to handle the Quran and to read it, and is considered to be acceptable (neutral, mubah) to recite it, although it is better liked (recommended, mustahabb) to be ritually pure. A mushaf is only a Quran if it is the Arabic Quranic text, and a book that contains more than 50% non-Quranic material is not viewed as a Quran for the above purposes, even if it contains verses of the Quran or the entire Quranic text. Examples would be a tafsir, or a translation of the Quran such as Yusuf Ali's (with commentary) which contains over fifteen times as much text in footnotes than it does in Quranic text or Quranic interpretation in either Arabic or English, or a book of hadith that contains Quranic verses embedded in the narrations.  Shia views  In respect to purity of non- Muslims, some of the Shia Muslims believe in the impurity of non-Muslims. However, there are others which believe in purity of non-Muslims. Some people such as Shaykh Tusi believed that it is not permissible to eat with Kuffar or non-Muslims. Considering non-believers as Najis has been prevalent until twentieth century. Muhaqiq Hilli also believes in impurity of non-believers. Most of maraji (authorities such as Sayyid Ruhollah Khomeini, Nasir Makarim Shirazi, Sayyid Muhammad Rida Gulpaygani, and Sayyid Abu al-Qasim Khu’i) believed in impurity of Kuffar, including Ahle Al Kitab. Of course, Khu'i pointed out precaution ruling in the subject. However, there are some authorities such as Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, Muhammad Fadil Lankarani, Sayyid ‘Ali al-Sistani, and Sayyid ‘Ali Khamene’i who did not believe in impurity of Ahle-Al-Kitab. Some scholars such as Mulla Muhsin Fayd al-Kashani (d. 1680) and Al-Muhaqqiq al-Bahrani (d. 1708) did not believe in the impurity of non- believers, and particularly non-Kitabi. For instance, Kashani believes that the impurity of Kuffar is spiritual and internal, so there is no need to wash after touching them. This group believes in the purity of non-Muslims and of all humans. Muhammad Ibrahim Jannaati, Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlullah, Seyed Mostafa Mohaghegh Damad and Yusuf Sani‘i are part of this group.  Cleaning the teeth  Cleaning teeth is also very important. Muhammad is reported to have said that the angels of mercy turn away from a person whose mouth emits foul smell because of unclean teeth. It is not only unhygienic to neglect cleaning teeth but also an anti-social habit likely to repel people from one's presence. It is narrated by Ibn Majah to \\"use the Miswaak, for verily, it purifies the mouth, and it is a Pleasure for the Lord. Jibreel (A.S.) exhorted me so much to use the Miswaak that I feared that its use would be decreed obligatory upon me and upon my Ummah. If I did not fear imposing hardship on my Ummah, I would have made its use obligatory upon my people. Verily, I use the Miswaak so much that I fear the front part of my mouth being peeled (by constant and abundant brushing with the Miswaak).\\"  Smoking  The mixed views on the subject came about because tobacco had not been introduced to Arabia at the time when the Quran was written in the 7th century CE. Therefore, one cannot find a verse of Quran or words of Muhammad saying clearly that \\"Smoking is forbidden.\\" However, there are many instances where the Quran gives general guidelines, and calls upon Muslims to use their reason and intelligence, and seek guidance from Allah about what is right and wrong. It is universally understood that smoking causes a number of health problems that often ultimately result in death: smoking is, depending on the madhhab, considered to be either makruh or haram, but in Sunni madhhabs it is not considered to cause one to lose ritual purity.

Cornish Language Partnership. () is a medieval house with Tudor additions, situated in the parish of Calstock in the east of Cornwall, England. It is a rambling granite and slate-stone manor house on the banks of the River Tamar that has been little changed over five centuries. It was built by the Edgecumbe family in 1458 after the original Manor House was pulled down. Sir Richard Edgecumbe came into the property after fighting for Henry Tudor in the Battle of Bosworth. He was gifted with money and the original Manor House and estate and then proceeded to build Cotehele. History Probably originating circa 1300, the main phases of building appear to have been started by Sir Richard Edgcumbe from 1485-89 and followed by his son, Sir Piers Edgcumbe, from 1489-1520\\\\. This house is one of the least altered of the Tudor houses in the United Kingdom. The outbuildings include a stone dovecote in a remarkable state of preservation. For centuries a second home of the Edgcumbe family, it was the first property to be accepted by the Treasury in payment of death duty. The house and estate are now under the care of the National Trust. Notable contents include the Cotehele cupboard and the Cotehele clock. The house contains many tapestries that came, along with much of the furniture, from Mount Edgcumbe House. Regretably, some have had pieces cut out to fit them in their new locations. The site The house is a Grade I listed building, having been so designated on 21 July 1951. The house was probably founded around 1300 and various alterations were made in the early fifteenth century. Sir Richard Edgcumbe seems to have been involved in the first phase of development from 1486 to 1489, with his son Sir Piers Edgcumbe taking over for the second phase, from 1489 to 1520. The grounds stretch down to a quay on the River Tamar where there is an outpost of the National Maritime Museum. There are a number of formal gardens and a richly planted area in the valley; features include a medieval dovecote, a stewpond, a Victorian summerhouse and the eighteenth century Prospect Tower. The gardens and parkland are listed as Grade II* on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. The south west side of the estate is bordered by the Morden stream which joins the Tamar at the quay. The estate mill is fed by this stream. The mill was used to grind grain bought in Plymouth and brought up river on the barge Myrtle, and also to drive a sawmill and a generator for electricity. The Grade II listed mill has been restored to working order, producing flour for use in the restaurant as well as for sale. In 2008 a 'Mother Orchard' of over 250 apple trees, mainly of West-country varieties was planted. The 8 acre orchard site is divided into eating, culinary and cider varieties. Cotehele's chapels =Cotehele House Chapel= In Cotehele, on the west side of Hall Court are the Vicarage and the Chapel, the chapel is connected to the main building via a small passageway leading to the dining room. The patron saints are St. Katharine and St. Anne. The chapel is among the oldest rooms in the house, alongside the Great Hall. In the chapel, there is a very rare and the original clock, still in operation today, it dates back to the Tudor period. =Cotehele Woodland Chapel= In the grounds of Cotehele, directly East of the House close to the River Tamar, lies a peaceful, basic chapel. inside there are pews going around the walls, two minister's benches and a very ornate table. the patron saint of the chapel is that of St. Thomas Becket. =The Edgcumbe Chapel= The Edgcumbe Chapel is located in the East of the Northern aisle at St. Andrew's Church Calstock, it contains two monuments of the late 17th- century: to Piers Edgcumbe (1666) and to Jemima, Countess of Sandwich (1674). it is no longer a chapel, but used by ministers to store religious items. Film location Cotehele was used in the filming of Trevor Nunn's 1996 film adaptation of Twelfth Night. it was used for scenes taking place in the quayside tavern and the inside of Orsino's castle.

DGM has released solo music by Fripp as well as work by various affiliated musicians and bands including King Crimson, The Vicar, the California Guitar Trio and others. The label has offices in Salisbury, England, and Los Angeles, California;Billboard, 1998 DGM has aimed to be \\"a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed,\\" according to Fripp. according to Its policy is that its artists retain all copyrights; consequently, even DGM's corporate logo is owned by its designer. The label was an early adopter of the digital download system. DGM's aims have been hailed as \\"exemplary\\", and the label has been credited with having expanded \\"the possibilities of experimental music\\" and having improved the environment for King Crimson. The DGM label name is derived from the title of a 1981 King Crimson album (Discipline) and from the name of Singleton's previous recording business (The Mobile). The label logo also partly reflects the artwork for the Discipline album (featuring a new but similar knotwork commissioned from the artist Steve Ball).Discipline Global Mobile - Ball Diary 13 Foundation and business aims The founder of Discipline Global Mobile, Robert Fripp has called music \\"an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed\\". Having been a professional musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), by the late 1980s Robert Fripp found himself in conflict with his longtime record label E.G. Records and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. to himself and to other band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer David Singleton, initially on a Guitar Craft tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' Show of Hands and the eponymous album for the Fripp-and-Toyah-fronted group Sunday All Over the World. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's Frame by Frame and 1992's The Great Deceiver) and continues to the present day under the name of TonProb. After seven years, Fripp and E.G. reached a settlement but the experience left Fripp determined to take control of his own work and financial affairs wherever possible. As part of this aim, he founded Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) as an independent music label in 1992, as a fifty-fifty partnership with Singleton. DGM's mission statement consists of five \\"DGM business aims\\", as follows: * \\"The first aim of DGM is to help bring music into the world which would otherwise be unlikely to do so, or under conditions prejudicial to the music and / or musicians.\\", * \\"The second aim of DGM is to operate in the market place, while being free of the values of the market place.\\" * \\"The third aim of DGM is to help the artists and staff of DGM achieve what they wish for themselves.\\" * \\"The fourth aim of DGM is to find its audience.\\" * \\"The fifth aim of DGM is to be a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed.\\" John Paul Jones has recorded albums with DGM without signing a contract, stating that the relationship \\"is pure trust\\". These aims were called \\"exemplary\\" by Bill Martin, who wrote that \\"Fripp has done something very important for the possibilities of experimental music\\" in creating DGM, and that DGM \\"has played a major role in creating favorable conditions for\\" King Crimson. Since at least the early 1960s, the recording industry has required artists to sign over copyrights and moral rights to their cover art, music, and lyrics. DGM rejects this practice, and since its 1992 founding has maintained its policy that its artists retain the copyrights and the moral rights to their works, be those works musical or visual art. Fripp wrote, > \\"The phonographic copyright in these performances is operated by Discipline > Global Mobile on behalf of the artists, with whom it resides, contrary to > common practice in the record industry. Discipline accepts no reason for > artists to assign the copyright interests in their work to either record > company or management by virtue of a 'common practice' which was always > questionable, often improper, and is now indefensible.\\" This extends even to DGM's knotwork corporate logo, the copyright of which is owned not by the company, but by its designer, Steve Ball. cites as the original inspiration for the first cover for Discipline a design by : DGM does not require that its artists sign written contracts. Former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones said, \\"It's pure trust,\\" and noted that \\"there are dangers on both sides. I could have a successful album and just sign with a major, or they could decide not to pay me.\\" Jones explained that he was accustomed to \\"working in situations that do rely on trust and integrity, those old-fashioned words\\" because Led Zeppelin had no contract with its manager. Another DGM band, alternative rock group The Rosenbergs, opted to work with the label following conflicts with their previous label Universal Records, which had even demanded control of the band's domain name: in contrast, DGM had encouraged them to retain control of their own master recordings and provided them with funds for touring and promoting their album.) Royalties are paid above the prevailing rate, as announced at DGM's launch. In return, DGM artists are responsible for promoting their albums through concert tours and interviews. Artists and back catalogue King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew has recorded several albums with DGM. Discipline Global Mobile specializes in art rock, progressive rock, jazz, and assorted experimental and crossover music (the label has also released recordings of Renaissance lute music and mainstream alternative rock). DGM has released more than a hundred King Crimson recordings, including remastered albums with bonus tracks and DVDs with archival footage. In addition to King Crimson, DGM's current active roster includes assorted Robert Fripp projects and The Vicar (a songwriter project). The label has previously released music by various Fripp-affiliated ensembles; The League of Crafty Guitarists, Les Gauchos Allemagnes, the California Guitar Trio and the Robert Fripp String Quartet (all of which stem from or are connected with Fripp's Guitar Craft courses) =Current/recent DGM artists= * King Crimson (over 100 releases of archive material and additional releases outside of current major-label product) * The ProjeKcts (King Crimson subgroups) * Robert Fripp (solo releases, Soundscape recordings) * Fripp & Eno * The Vicar * David Sylvian & Robert Fripp (reissues) * Jakszyk, Fripp & Collins =Past DGM artists= * Adrian Belew * BPM&M; * Bill Bruford (with Ralph Towner & Eddie Gomez) * Bill Bruford's Earthworks * Bruford Levin Upper Extremities * California Guitar Trio * Europa String Choir * Robert Fripp String Quintet * Tony Geballe * Gitbox * Trey Gunn * Peter Hammill * Steve Hancoff * Jacob Heringman * John Paul Jones * Tony Levin * Los Gauchos Alemanes * Mr McFall's Chamber * Bill Nelson * Opus 20 * Juan Carlos Quintero * The Rosenbergs * Ten Seconds Mail- order and on-line services According to a 1998 profile in Billboard magazine, Discipline Global Mobile had seven staff members in Salisbury, England, and three in Los Angeles, California. DGM \\"is actually housed in a dull pebbledash building in a village near Salisbury, south-west England\\". Its label manager reported that the country with the largest market was Japan, where mail-orders accounted for only 10% of sales, but 50% of profits. In 1998, DGM was distributed in Japan by Pony Canyon; in the United Kingdom by Pinnacle; and in the United States by Rykodisc. Sound samples have been offered in addition to DGM's mail-order services. Free downloads from DGM have strengthened the relations between artists and fans. In 2012, DGM's site had the following introduction: \\"The aim of DGM is to connect music, musician and audience in a way that supports the power of music, the integrity of the musician and the needs of the audience. DGM Live offers music for download with photographs, diary archives and audience commentary for browsing\\". DGM's successful transition to an age of digital distribution was called \\"unique\\" among music labels in 2009; this success was credited to its provision of legal, high-quality recordings of concerts, which effectively reverse- engineered the distribution-networks for unlicensed recordings (\\"bootlegs\\") of concerts. DGM publishes on-line diaries by Robert Fripp and David Singleton. A moderated forum allows fans to ask questions or to leave comments. Together, the diaries and the fan forum display delayed dialogs in which the artists and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings. Fripp's public writing of his diary has challenged his readers to become more active listeners and intelligent participants in performances of music. =Conflict with Grooveshark= Fripp's diaries were internationally discussed following his publication of documents from a dispute with Grooveshark, an on-line distributor of music. Fripp and Singleton complained that Grooveshark had been continuing to distribute his music, even after repeated takedown notices and other complaints. Their correspondence with Grooveshark was published by Digital Music News and in his DGM diary.: August: \\"Friday, 12th August 2011\\", \\"Saturday, 13th August 2011\\", \\"Monday, 15th August 2011\\", \\"Tuesday, 16th August 2011\\", \\"Wednesday, 17th August 2011\\"; September: \\"Wednesday, 7th September 2011\\", \\"Saturday, 10th September 2011\\", \\"Monday, 12th September 2011\\", \\"Wednesday, 14th September 2011\\", \\"Thursday, 15th September 2011\\", \\"Wednesday, 21 September 2011\\", and \\"Monday, 26th September 2011\\"; October: \\"Thursday, October 13th, 2011\\" and \\"Thursday, 20th October 2011\\". Fripp's exchange with Grooveshark was included in a suit against Grooveshark by Universal Music Group, which was filed in November 2011.Lawsuit claims Grooveshark workers posted 100,000 pirated songs.

M. Klein. Klein's only novel was written after his pilgrimage to the newly founded nation of Israel in 1949. It concerns the quest for meaning in the post- Holocaust world, as an unnamed narrator, a Montreal journalist, editor, poet and Zionist, who traveled to the State of Israel soon after its founding, searches for his long-lost uncle, Melech Davidson, a Holocaust survivor, in post-war Italy, Morocco, and Israel. Klein's novel parallels the biblical story of the Exodus from Egypt, with the modern Jewish immigration to Israel after the war being compared to the original Exodus story. It is arranged in \\"books\\" (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy), with each book loosely based on its equivalent from the Torah, and in the Jewish Talmudic tradition, several glosses further the ideas of each book at the end of the novel. The novel incorporates modes from poetry, drama and prayer, and contains elements of metafiction. The novel's protagonist travels to Israel, seeking \\"a new revelation of God’s purpose in the world,\\" the \\"second scroll” of the title, and finds not a new revelation, but a new people being created: \\"In the streets, in the shops, everywhere about me I had looked but had not seen. It was all there all the time — the fashioning folk, anonymous and unobserved, creating word by word, phrase by phrase, the total work that when completed would stand as the epic revealed.\\" According to Cynthia Ozick, The Second Scroll tells of a reborn Israel in language that is “Influenced yet liberated by Joyce, forged in the laboratory of the English language as it exerts all its fathomless force, immersed simultaneously in Bible, Hebrew, Jerusalem and 20th-century history, this prophetically intricate work is the antithesis of what we have come to expect of the so-called — and largely secular — Jewish-American novel. (Think not Roth but Blake.)” The book was translated into French as Le Second rouleau by Charlotte and Robert Melancon, who won the Quebec Governor General's Aaward for their translation.

Ovo vegetarianism is a type of vegetarianism which allows for the consumption of eggs but not dairy products, in contrast with lacto vegetarianism. Those who practice ovo vegetarianism are called ovo-vegetarians. \\"Ovo\\" comes from the Latin word for egg. Motivations Ethical motivations for excluding dairy products are based on issues with the industrial practices behind the production of milk. Concerns include the practice of keeping a cow constantly pregnant in order for her to lactate and the slaughter of unwanted male calves. Other concerns include the standard practice of separating the mother from her calf and denying the calf its natural source of milk.The Dairy Cow from the website of the Vegan Society This contrasts with the industrial practices surrounding egg-laying hens, which produce eggs for human consumption without being fertilized. Ovo-vegetarians often prefer free-range eggs, that is, those produced by uncaged hens.Hens & Eggs from the website of the Vegan Society Many ovo-vegetarians refuse to eat fertilized eggs, with balut being an extreme example where the egg has developed. Some vegetarians are lactose intolerant and have a casein allergy, and are therefore unwilling to consume milk or other dairy products. Carbon emissions associated with keeping hens are less than those associated with cattle, a factor significant to those practicing environmental vegetarianism. Concerns Ethical concerns about the consumption of eggs arise from the practice of culling male chicks shortly after birth.Day 20: Hard Boiled, Deviled & Devastated , a January 26, 2008 blog post from a Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center blog Practices considered humane for chick culling include maceration and suffocation using carbon dioxide.

First published by Lester and Orpen Dennys in 1981, it chronicles Canada's internment and persecution of its citizens of Japanese descent during the Second World War from the perspective of a young child. In 2005, it was the One Book, One Vancouver selection. The book is often required reading for university English courses on Canadian Literature. It also figures in Ethnic Studies and Asian American Literature courses in the United States. Kogawa uses strong imagery of silence, stones and streams throughout the novel. She has many interesting dreams that are carried throughout the novel as well. Themes depicted in the novel include memory and forgetting, prejudice and tolerance, identity, and justice versus injustice. Kogawa contemplates many of these themes in her poetry as well. Plot Set in Canada, Obasan centres on the memories and experiences of Naomi Nakane, a 36-year-old schoolteacher living in the rural Canadian town of Cecil, Alberta, when the novel begins. The death of Naomi's uncle, with whom she had lived as a child, leads Naomi to visit and care for her widowed aunt Aya, whom she refers to as Obasan (Obasan being the Japanese word for \\"Aunt\\" in this context). Her brief stay with Obasan in turn becomes an occasion for Naomi to revisit and reconstruct in memory her painful experiences as a child during and after World War II, with the aid of a box of correspondence and journals sent to her by her Aunt Emily, detailing the years of the measures taken by the Canadian government against the Japanese citizens of Canada and their aftereffects. With the aid of Aunt Emily's letters, Naomi learns that her mother, who had been in Japan before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, was severely injured by the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki; a finding which changes her perspective of the 'War in the Pacific', and rekindles the heartbreak she experienced as a child. Naomi's narration thus interweaves two stories, one of the past and another of the present, mixing experience and recollection, history and memory throughout. Naomi's struggle to come to terms with both past and present confusion and suffering form the core of the novel's plot. Although Obasan is fiction, the events, Parliamentary legal documents, and overall notion of racism mirror reality. Through the eyes of fictional characters, Kogawa tells the story of Japanese-Canadians during the Second World War. Characters Naomi's family tree The characters in Obasan are part of Naomi's Japanese-Canadian family. Its members fall into three major groups, depending on their birthplace and, consequently, nationality. The \\"Issei\\" are first-generation Japanese-Canadians, Japan-born emigrants living in Canada. Their children are the \\"Nisei\\" or second-generation Japanese-Canadians, Canadian-born people with Canadian nationality, and the \\"Nisei\\"'s children, the \\"Sansei\\", or third-generation Japanese- Canadians.Japanese Canadians References Category:1981 Canadian novels Category:Canadian historical novels Category:Novels set in Alberta Category:Novels set in Japan Category:Internment of Japanese Canadians Category:Fiction set in 1972 Category:American Book Award-winning works Category:Japanese-Canadian culture Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ","title":"Obasan"},{"id":"3388273","text":"Máel Coluim of Atholl was Mormaer of Atholl between 1153/9 and the 1190s.MacDonald, Outlaws, p. 77, n. 75.

It was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1934 and 1935. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 24, 1972, due to its architectural significance. History The Decatur branch of the Alabama State Bank opened its doors on July 29, 1833. It was authorized by the Alabama General Assembly in 1830 to be one of three branches of the Alabama State Bank. After outstanding debts of over $1 million were unable to be reformed the Decatur branch franchise was revoked. The building remained vacant until the 1860s when it was one of four buildings that survived the Civil War in Decatur, Alabama. During the Battle of Decatur, the bank was used as headquarters for the Union forces in the area and was also used as a hospital while battles raged outside. Such evidence of the battle remains: bloodstains are visible in one of the three vaults and slugs from musket fire and Minié balls are still clearly seen in the walls of the building. In 1881, the First National Bank opened its doors in the Old State Bank building. But, when First National Bank completed its new office in 1902, the bank building was used as a residence and office by J. Y. Cantwell. After signs of deterioration began to show themselves, Cantwell's grand niece, W. B. Edmundson, deeded the building over to the City of Decatur in 1933. Management of the structure was vested in an eight-member Board of Governors. The petition for restoration was presented to the Civil Works Administration and restoration commenced. Being one of only a handful of local buildings to survive the destruction of the American Civil War, and after going through the many changes over the years, the Old State Bank has become a symbol of historical significance. By the year 1946, the building was deeded by its owner to the Morgan County American Legion, Post No. 15. At some point, the original bank building was completely obscured by a brick facade which also enclosed the front portico and columns. The appearance was simply a huge, ugly, brick warehouse and, by the early 1970s, the original history was long forgotten. As part of a plan to remove aging, blighted buildings, a demolition crew was contracted to tear down the old building with a wrecking ball. It was soon obvious that something unusual was present when the wrecking ball could tear right through the front wall at some places, but the heavy ball bounced off other spots. The invincible spots were found to be the five limestone columns hidden behind bricks for generations. (A few of the columns still carry wrecking ball scars.) The project to demolish the old, blighted warehouse quickly transformed into restoring this centerpiece of a newly formed historical district. The fountains in front of the Old State Bank frozen in winter 2008. In 1972, the Old State Bank was named to the National Register of Historical Places at the age of 139 years. Three years later, in 1975, the American Legion, Post No. 15, donated the Old State Bank building to the City of Decatur. Plans for restoration were put together in the year 1976, as the bank turned 143 years old, and was put under the control of the Old Bank Board members. Restoration of the bank was finished in the year 1983, at the age of 150. In 1984, a curator was appointed, and daily tours were implemented. The second wave of detailed restoration was undertaken in the years of 1995-1996 and was led by noted preservation architect, Harvie Jones. Funding was provided by the Alabama Historical Commission, the City of Decatur, and the Old Bank Board of Directors. The City of Decatur commemorated the bank's 175th anniversary in 2008.  Architecture  The architecture of the bank shows the influence of Thomas Jefferson's fusion of Palladianism with Roman temple forms. The five limestone columns across the front weigh 100-150 tons each and were mined in nearby Trinity. The pentastyle portico is highly unusual.

It is the last among Ray's Calcutta trilogy series, the previous two being, Pratidwandi (The Adversary, 1970) and Seemabaddha (Company Limited, 1971). Plot The film portrays the economic difficulties faced by middle-class, educated, urban youth in 1970s India. After achieving only moderate academic results and making numerous unsuccessful attempts to find a job, Somnath (Pradip Mukherjee), the central protagonist struggles in his daily life. One day while Somnath was walking down the lane in the crowded Burrabazar area of urban Kolkata, he slips over a banana peel, and coincidentally meets Bishuda(Utpal Dutt). He confesses to Bishuda about his unsuccessful attempts in getting a suitable job for himself. Bishuda advises him to start his own business. Somnath finally decides to start his own business as a middle-man--i.e. a self-employed salesman. He soon however finds himself involved in unethical behaviours, which is contrary to his upbringing. His friend Sukumar, having gone through similar ordeals but finally being unable to land a job, becomes a taxi-driver. One day, Somnath finds that in order to land a big order, he must propitiate a client by supplying him with a prostitute. Despite his hesitation and after trying several brothels, Somnath, with the help of a more experienced operator, finds a girl for the purpose. However, she turns out to be his friend Sukumar's sister. Embarrassed and at a loss, Somnath offers her money and requests her to leave, but the girl refuses. Her purpose is to earn money, not beg, she tells him. Somnath delivers her to his client and lands the contract but is remorseful.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 88% based on 8 reviews with an average rating of 6.53/10. Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Reader considers it to have \\"the best performances of any Ray film I've seen and a milieu that may remind you of both Billy Wilder's The Apartment and John Cassavetes's Faces.\\" Time Out considers it to be \\"absorbing viewing\\". Leah Garchik of SF Gate compared the film to Michael Moore's Roger & Me (released 15 years after this film), writing that \\"[w]here Moore hits you over the head with his point, though, Ray's presentation is much more sophisticated and elegant.\\" Despite criticizing the film's middle as being \\"bogged down\\", she praises the film's use of sound as being \\"remarkable. [...] From the very start, when Somnath is pictured taking his final exam, there's no background music; all you hear is the squeaking of pens on paper. The film's silences are more attention-getting and mesmerizing than the most demanding background music.\\" She concludes that the film \\"evokes an insidious amorality that he sees as an inevitable side effect of the huge pressures from within the family and outside to get ahead and make something of oneself.\\" Bhaskar Chattopadhyay, writing for Firstpost, called it \\"Ray's most cynical, ruthless film\\". He writes that the \\"film’s most brutal scenes\\": \\"Ray literally, and perhaps for the first time in his filmmaking career, bares his fangs and pokes us in the eye to show us what a strange and hopeless world we live in. Shot beautifully in black and white, with the use of light to symbolically cover only one half of most faces in the night scenes, juxtaposing the ruthless streets and markets against a loving and caring sister-in-law at home who supports him no matter what, and once again focusing on the human content more than the external glamour, Ray puts Somnath in a world of shocks and surprises, only to make him realise, that beginning right from education, to employment, to entrepreneurship, there is no country for an honest man.\\" Times of India shared a similar view, calling the \\"film’s climax [...] an out and out shocker in which Somnath faces a startling dilemma of epic proportions, and just like Ray visualizes he fails to choose the right path, and he is now neither noble, nor a hero.\\". A negative review came from Elliott Stein of Film Comment, who gave the film one star out of four. He called it \\"predictable\\" and criticized the central performance from Mukherjee, calling him \\" a drab performer whose loss of innocence is uninvolving.\\" Despite this, he praised some of the film's \\"near-Dickensian passages\\" and praised Rabi Ghosh's performance as the \\"“public relations” man who becomes the Brahmin’s mentor in petty capitalism.\\" The film has been nominated for and won the following awards since its release: Best Direction New Delhi, 1975; Best Film, Direction, Screenplay, Government of West Bengal, 1975 and Karlovy Vary Prize, 1976.

The house with its surrounding garden has been owned by the National Trust since 1953 and is open to the public. The garden features an orchard with old varieties of fruit trees. Nomenclature The prefix Tre- or Tref- is commonly found in Cornish and Welsh place names, denoting \\"hamlet, farmstead or estate\\", and dates from the 7th century Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. About 1,300 such place names survive in Cornwall west of the River Tamar, but 3 survive in neighbouring Devon, the next adjoining county beyond the Tamar. A few instances also exist in Glamorgan, on the north side of the Bristol Channel from Cornwall. The prefix is equivalent to Anglo-Saxon suffix -tun or -ton, rare in Cornish speaking areas until the later versio -towe becomes prevalent. The second part of the place name -Rice (compare the name Price 'Son of Rice' from Ap Rhys cf. Welsh Rhys) is the name of the man who held the estate.Padel, O. J., Place-Names, pp. 88–90, published in Kain, Roger & Ravenhill, William, (eds.) Historical Atlas of South-West England, Exeter, 1999 Manor house Trerice House features a main south-east facing range of 'E'-plan abutting a south-west range containing two earlier phases. Phase I consisted of a tower house with low north-west block. This was extended early in the 16th century, probably by 'Jack of Tilbury', to include a 2-storey range to the south-east of the earlier tower, together now forming the bulky south wing. Sir John Arundell, High Sheriff of Cornwall and father-in-law to Sir Richard Carew, historian, added the main range of the E-plan circa 1570–1573. History The manor of Trerice was from the 14th century to 1768 the seat of the Arundell family \\"of Trerice\\", which appears to have been connected (by unknown means) with the equally prominent Arundell family \\"of Lanherne\\", 6 miles to the north-east of Trerice, and of Tolverne in Cornwall and later of Wardour Castle in Wiltshire. Both families used the same armorials. In 1768 on the failure of the male line it passed by entail to the Wentworth family, Earls of Strafford, and on the extinction of that family in 1802 passed by entail to the Acland baronets of Devon and Somerset, who sold it in 1915 to Cornwall County Council. =Descent= de Terise Arms of Lansladron: Sable, three chevronels argent,Lysons Brothers, Magna Britannia, Vol.3, Cornwall later quartered by the Arundells of Trerice The earliest known holder was the de Terise family, which took its surname from the manor, whose descent is recorded in the Heraldic Visitations of Cornwall as follows:.Vivian, 1887, p.11 *Udy de Terise *Otes de Terise, son, who married Rose Goviley, daughter and heiress of Goviley by his wife Maude de Lansladron, daughter and heiress of Sir Serlo de Lansladron, of Lansladron in Cornwall, who was summoned to parliament as a baron by King Edward I (1272–1307).

These are early canting arms, based on the French for swallow hirondelle. They were recorded for Reinfred de Arundel (d. circa 1280), lord of the manor of Lanherne, Cornwall, in the 15th-century Shirley Roll of Arms The origins of the Arundell family of Trerice are obscure and no reliable descent has been traced from the family of Arundell of Lanherne, Cornwall, 6 miles to the north-east of Trerice, called by Leland \\"The Great Arundells\\". These two main Arundell families are easily confused as both called most of the male heirs by the Christian name \\"John\\". The earliest recorded English Arundell is the 11th century Norman magnate Roger Arundel, feudal baron of Poorstock in Dorset, recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, whose family died out in the male line in 1165.Sanders, I. J. English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086–1327, Oxford, 1960, p. 72 No such place as Arundel appears to exist in Normandy, and no territorial prefix de is shown before Roger's surname in Domesday. The early armorials of the Arundells of Trerice were Gules, a lion rampant or,Tonkin & Borlase, as quoted by Lysons, Magna Britannia, Vol.3 but the family later used the same canting arms as Arundell of Lanherne: Sable, six swallows 3, 2 and 1 argent (derived from the French hirondelle, a swallow). The Arundells of Trerice are said to have had their English origins during the reign of King Henry III (1216–1272) at the manor of \\"Caryhayes, Carshayes, Kierhaies or Kenelhelvas\\"Vivian, 1887, p. 11 in Cornwall,Caryhayes was in Cornwall, see: Vivian, 1887, p. 11, note 2 or at AllerfordDelderfield, Eric R., West Country Historic Houses and their Families, Newton Abbot, 1968, p. 142 in Somerset. However the Lysons brothers (1814) stated:Lysons, Magna Britannia, Vol. 3, 1814, Cornwall, Extinct Gentry Families :\\"We think it extremely probable, from the frequent recurrence of the family-names of Nicholas and John, that the Arundells of Trerice were descended from a younger son of Sir Nicholas Arundell, of Hempston-Arundell, (i.e. Little Hempston near Totnes) in Devonshire, the elder branch of which failed by the death of his son Sir John, in the reign of Henry III\\". The family's descent is recorded in the Heraldic Visitations of Cornwall as follows:. =Ralph Arundell= Ralph Arundell of Kierhaies (or Kenelhelvas) who during the reign of King Edward III (1327–1377) married Jane de Terise, heiress of Trerice. =Nicholas Arundell= baron side of the impalement shows Lanslasdron quartering Pellor: Azure, a chevron or between three bezants Nicholas Arundell, son and heir, who married Elizabeth Pellor, daughter and heiress of John Pellor (alias Cheddore) of Pellor =Sir John Arundell= Sir John Arundell, son and heir, who married Jane Durant, daughter and heiress of John Durant (or Jane Lupus daughter of Lupus of Crantock by his wife a daughter and heiress of Lupus of Durant). His second son was Richard Arundell of Penbigell, Sheriff of Cornwall in 1408. =Nicholas Arundell= Bletso: Argent, on a chief gules two mullets or Nicholas II Arundell, son, who married Johanna St John (died 1482), daughter of Edward St John of Somerset and heiress of her brother William St John (died 1473). From this marriage the Arundells inherited the manors of Selworthy and Luccombe, on the north coast of Somerset opposite Glamorgan where Fonmon Castle was the family's earliest seat, built by Sir Oliver St. John, one of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, followers of Robert FitzHamon (died 1107), the Norman conqueror of Glamorgan. The North Somerset estate of Holnicote was in the parish of Selworthy, and had been inherited on the marriage in 1745 of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet (1723–1785) to Elizabeth Dyke, heiress of Holnicote, Tetton and Pixton.Acland, 1981, p. 15 The Aclands became heirs to the Arundell estates in 1802 (see below). Fragments of stained glass survive in the east window of the north aisle of Selworthy Church showing the arms of Nicholas I Arundell of Trerys, and of his wife Elizabeth Pellor (alias Pellower) (sable, a chevron or between three bezants), grandparents of Nicholas II Arundell who inherited Selworthy, who clearly inserted the glass in memory of his grandparents as he was the first to have a connection with Selworthy.Hancock, 1897, p. 24 These Pellor arms are also visible on the monumental brass to Sir John IV Arundell (died 1561) in Stratton Church (see image below).

These are instead the arms of Edward St John (1394/5-1448/9) and his wife Joan (le Jewe) St John, parents of Joan St John, heiress of Luccombe and Selworthy and wife of Nicholas II Arundell of Trerice.Hancock, 1897, p. 22 =Sir John Arundell (c.1428–71)= Sir John Arundell, son, was the Sheriff of Cornwall until his death in 1471. According to the Cornish historian, Richard Carew in his Survey of Cornwall: ::\\"Being forewarned that he would be slain on the sands, forsook his house at Efford, as too maritime, and removed to Trerice his more inland habitation in the same county; but he did not escape his fate, for being Sheriff of Cornwall in that year, and the Earl of Oxford surprising Mount Michael for the House of Lancaster, he had the king's commands, by his office, to endeavour the reducing of it, and lost his life in a skirmish on the sands thereabouts\\". :St Michael's Mount had been captured by the earl of Oxford, and as Sheriff it fell to Arundell to obey the king's command. He was buried in the chapel in St Michael's Mount. He married twice: firstly to Margaret Courtenay, daughter of \\"Sir Hugh Courtenay\\", whose identity is unclear,Maud Courtenay, a daughter of Sir Hugh Courtenay of Boconnoc (died 1471), married Sir John Arundell (born 1428) of Tolverne (a junior branch of Arundell of Lanherne), not Sir John Arundell of Trerice, according to Vivian, 1895, (Devon) p. 245 & Vivian, 1887 (Cornwall), p. 6 by whom he had two sons Robert and Walter, who died young, without children. he married secondly to Anne Moyle, daughter of Sir Walter Moyle of Estwell, by whom he had children four sons, the eldest two of whom, Robert and Sir John III, succeeded successively to Trerice. =Robert Arundell= Robert Arundell, eldest son and heir, who married Ellen Southwood. =James Arundell (died 1491)= James Arundell (died 1491), son, who died without children when his heir became his uncle Sir John Arundell. =Sir John Arundell (1470–1512)= Sir John Arundell (1470–1512), uncle, second son of Sir John Arundell. He was Sheriff of Cornwall and Vice Admiral of the West to King Henry VII and to his son King Henry VIII. He married Jane Grenville (died 1552), a daughter of Sir Thomas Grenville (died 1513), KB, lord of the manors of Bideford in Devon and of Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton in Cornwall, Sheriff of Cornwall in 1481 and in 1486.Richard Polwhele, The Civil and Military History of Cornwall, volume 1, London, 1806, pp 106–9; Byrne, vol. 1, p. 302 states \\"1485\\", quoting Public Record Office, Lists & Indexes, vol. IX, List of Sheriffs The Grenville seat of Stowe was situated about 4 miles north of the Arundell secondary seat of Efford/Stratton, Bude. During the Wars of the Roses in his youth Grenville had been a Lancastrian supporter and had taken part in the conspiracy against Richard III organised by the Duke of Buckingham.Byrne, vol. 1, p. 302 On the accession of King Henry VII (1485–1509) and the end of the wars, Grenville was appointed one of the Esquires of the Body to that king. Jane Grenville survived her husband and remarried to Sir John Chamond of Launcells, about 1 mile south-east of Stratton. In her will she requested to be buried in Stratton Church, between the bodies of her two husbands.Vivian, 1887, p. 12 One of Jane Grenville's sisters, Katherine Grenville, married into the Arundell family of Lanherne, namely to Sir John VII Arundell of Lanherne (1474–1545) Knight Banneret, \\"the most important man in the county\\",Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.)

He was knighted at the Battle of the Spurs in 1513. In 1523 he achieved notability by the capture of a notorious pirate. He served twice as Sheriff of Cornwall, in 1532 and in 1541. His monumental brass survives in Stratton Church, Cornwall, the place of his burial,Dunkin, pp. 34–5 the parish church of his secondary seat at Efford, near Bude. John IV Arundell married twice: *Firstly at some time before 1512Vivian, 1887, p.12 to Mary Beville (died 1526), daughter and co-heiress of John Beville of Gwarnick, near Truro in Cornwall, whose sister and co-heiress Matilda Beville married his first cousin Sir Richard VII Grenville (c. 1495 – 1550), lord of the manors of Bideford in Devon and of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall (near Efford), MP for Cornwall in 1529 and Marshal of Calais 1535–40. By Mary Beville he had children as follows: Roger Arundell, declared a lunatic,Dunkin, Edwin Hadlow Wise, The Monumental Brasses of Cornwall with Descriptive, Genealogical and Heraldic Notes, 1882, p. 35 who predeceased his father, having married (during his lunacy) Elizabeth Denham, daughter of Robert Tredenham (alias Denham) of Tredenham, Cornwall. By his wife he had children: *John V Arundell (1557–1613), \\"of Gwarnick\\", who inherited the Beville estate of Gwarnick from his grandmother. He was an infant in wardship at the death of his grandfather Sir John IV Arundell in 1561, whose right heir he was. However, Sir John IV had previously conveyed a life-interest in most of his property, including Trerice, to his second and eldest surviving son John VI, from his second marriage, the infant's half-uncle. This was the source of a long-running legal dispute. In about 1565 the warder of the infant John V, who had a financial interest in his ward's estate until he reached his majority of 21, reached an agreement with his ward's half-uncle John VI under which the latter surrendered two large manors to his nephew on condition the warder would drop his claims to nullify the life interest in the remaining estates. In 1579, presumably having reached his majority, John V reluctantly confirmed the 1565 agreement made on his behalf, and furthermore agreed that if he should die childless the estates should descend to the children of his uncle John VI. However following his uncle' death in 1580 John V sought to overturn his 1579 agreement, and launched persistent legal suits against his uncle's son (his half-cousin) the four-year-old John VII Arundell (1576–1654) to recover all his grandfather's estates. Finally in 1610 John V obtained a ruling in the Court of Common Pleas permitting him to enter onto all the disputed lands. But his half-cousin John VII Arundell responded vigorously, and obtained a private Act of Parliament on 26 March 1610 which overturned the court's judgement and reaffirmed the 1579 settlement.Dunkin, p. 35 Three years later in 1613 John V Arundell of Gwarnick died, without children, and was buried in Lambeth Church, Surrey, when the estates reverted to Sir John VII Arundell (1576–1654). However, in his will John V bequeathed his claims to his grandfather's estates to two kinsmen, Richard II Prideaux (died 1617) of Thuborough, Devon and his son Jonathan Prideaux (died 1637), who later resumed the legal battle.

The Prideaux family is believed to be of Norman origin and to have first settled in England at some time after the Norman Conquest of 1066 at Prideaux Castle, near Fowey, in Cornwall. It abandoned that seat and moved to Devon, where it spread out in various branches, firstly at Orcharton, Modbury, then at Adeston, Holbeton, later at Thuborough, Sutcombe. From the Thuborough branch descended branches seated at Solden, Holsworthy which split into branches seated at Prideaux Place in Cornwall and at Netherton, Farway and Ford Abbey, Thorncombe in Devon; other branches were seated at Ashburton and at Nutwell, Woodbury in Devon.Vivian, Lt.Col.

It was one of the most widespread and successful of all the gentry families of Devon, and as remarked upon by Swete (died 1821), exceptionally most of the expansion was performed by younger sons, who by the custom of primogeniture were expected to make their own fortunes.Gray, Todd & Rowe, Margery (Eds.), Travels in Georgian Devon: The Illustrated Journals of The Reverend John Swete, 1789–1800, 4 vols., Tiverton, 1999, vol. 2, p. 107 Jane Arundell, wife of William Wall *Secondly in 1526 to Juliana Erissey, daughter of James Erissey of Erissey and widow of a certain Gourlyn, by whom he had children including: John VI Arundell (died 1580) of Trerice. =John Arundell (died 1580)= John Arundell (died 1580) of Trerice, eldest son by his father's second marriage, a Member of Parliament for Mitchell, Cornwall, in 1555 and 1558, and was High Sheriff of Cornwall in 1573–1574. Although his tenure of the Arundell estates was not fully secure due to the ongoing legal dispute with his half-nephew John V Arundell (died 1613) of Gwarnick, he built the present mansion house at Trerice in about 1572, which date appears above the plaster strapwork overmantel in the great hall.Jenkins, p. 55 He married twice: *Firstly to Catherine Cosowarth, daughter of John Cosowarth and widow of Alan Hill, by whom he had children four daughters: Juliana Arundell (born 1563), who married Richard Carew (1555–1620), the historian of Cornwall, author of the Survey of Cornwall.

He was an infant aged four on his father's death, and became a ward of the crown, which wardship was purchased by family trustees, including his brother-in-law Richard Carew. He inherited from his father the newly rebuilt mansion house at Trerice with over 2,000 acres in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset, with a reversionary interest in a further 3,050 acres, dependent on the death of his half-cousin John V Arundell (died 1613) of Gwarnick. Following the death of the latter, he sought to obtain possession of his estates, including the former Beville seat of Gwarnick, then claimed by the Prideaux family. In 1615 he obtained a Chancery decree under which he agreed to pay the Prideauxs £550 to abandon their claims. However Richard II Prideaux (died 1617) refused to comply with the verdict and was sent to the Fleet Prison, where he probably remained until his death two years later. The 1615 agreement was finally implemented in 1622. In 1637 he finally extinguished the Prideaux claim by paying £80 to Sir Richard Prideaux (died 1667), MP, the son and heir of Jonathan Prideaux (died 1637), MP, son of Richard II. He was a Royalist during the Civil War, during which he was Governor of Pendennis Castle, Falmouth, which he held during a five-month- long siege in 1646 by Parliamentarian forces, at the end of which his forces were reduced by hunger to eating their horses. He obtained an honourable surrender, but in 1651 compounded for delinquency in the sum of £10,000, later reduced to £2,000. He married Mary Cary, a daughter of George I Cary (1543–1601) of Clovelly, Devon, Sheriff of Devon in 1587,Vivian, 1895, pedigree of Cary who constructed the harbour wall at Clovelly.

He married Elizabeth Wentworth (died 1750), daughter of Sir William Wentworth of Ashby, Lincolnshire, and sister of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672–1739). She was buried in Sturminster Marshall Church in Dorset, in the chancel of which survives her ledger stone with armorials. The marriage was without children and on his death in 1768 the Barony of Arundell became extinct. Wentworth In his marriage settlement the 4th Baron Arundell had settled Trerice and his other estates including Efford and Bude in Cornwall, and Selworthy and Luccombe in Somerset, in default of his own issue, on his wife's nephew, William Wentworth (died 1776), a gentleman usher of the privy chamber to Augusta, Princess of Wales, son of Elizabeth's other brother Peter Wentworth of Henbury, Dorset, and in default of his issue with remainder to \\"Sir Thomas Acland, Baronet\\" (Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet (1723–1785)) and his heirs. William Wentworth duly succeeded to the estates under the settlement, and by his will dated 1775Hancock, 1897, pp. 22–4 resettled the estates on his own son Frederick Thomas Wentworth, 3rd Earl of Strafford (1732–1799), with remainder on failure of his issue, to the 3rd Earl's sister Augusta Anne Wentworth (died 1802), wife of John Hatfeild Kaye (1731–1804) of Hatfeild Hall, Stanley, West Yorkshire, and on failure of issue from both, (which was the event) to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet (1723–1785) and his issue. Following the death of Augusta Anne Kaye in 1802 without issue, Trerice and the other former Arundell estates passed to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet (1787–1871), grandson of the 7th Baronet.The sequence of settlements and resettlements is clearly described by Hancock, 1897, pp. 22–4: \\"The last Baron Arundell married in June, 1722, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Wentworth, of Wakefield, Yorkshire, and sister of Thomas Wentworth, who, in 1711, was created earl of Strafford. It appears that on his marriage Lord Arundell settled all his manors in default of his own issue on his wife's nephew, William Wentworth of Henbury, in the parish of Sturminster Marshall, Dorset, in tail. Lord Arundell died in August, 1768, aged 66, leaving no issue. The manors of Selworthy and Luccombe then devolved on the said William Wentworth, who barred his entail by recoveries suffered in Hilary Term, 9 Geo. Ill, 1769. Mr. Wentworth by his will, dated April 14, 1775, devised all his estates in Dorset, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, to his wife Susanna Wentworth, for her life, with remainder to his only son, Frederick Thomas Wentworth, for his life, with remainder to his (the said Frederick Thomas) first son and other sons in tail male, with remainder to his daughters in tail, with remainder to the testator's only daughter, Augusta Ann Kaye, then the wife of John Hatfield Kaye, for her life, with remainder to her first and other sons in tail male, with remainder to her daughters in tail ; and subject thereto he devised the manors of Selworthy and East Luccombe (in Somerset), Stockley Luccombe (in Devon), and Degembris, Goviley, Thurlbeer, Ebbingford, otherwise Efford, Penshayes, and the barton of Garrows (in Cornwall), which manors and farms had formed the estates of the Arundells of Trerice, to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, the seventh baronet, and he devised the \\" capital \\" messuages and farms of Henbury and Loscombe in Dorsetshire to his own right heirs. William Wentworth died early in the year 1776, and on the 22 June 1776, his will was proved by his son, Frederick Thomas, in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. His widow, Susanna, died in August, 1784, and was buried at Sturminster Marshall. The said Frederick Thomas, on the death of William, second earl of Strafford, of the creation of 171 1, succeeded to the earldom. He married Elizabeth Gould, and died without issue on the 5 April 1799, and was buried at Sturminster Marshall. Mrs. Kaye died without issue on the 23 April 1802, and was buried in the parish church of Wakefield. On her death, the late Sir Thomas Acland, tenth baronet, and the grandson of the seventh baronet, entered into possession of the estates devised to the latter by William Wentworth\\" In December 1784, Frederick Thomas Wentworth and his mother Susanna Wentworth became the first of several generations of absentee landlords of Trerice as the Manor house and home farm were leased to tenants.National Trust Guide to Trerice. 2007. p. 29.

Cornwall County Records Office, Truro. After Symons's death in 1789, the lease devolved to his son Samuel Symons until its expiration in 1805. The descendants of Mark and Samuel Symons have included the noted Victorian and Edwardian artist and designer William Christian Symons, . Mark Lancelot Symons, who an artist of religious and symbolic subjects, and Arthur Symons the distinguished poet, critic, editor and man of letters who is said to have had an influence on W.B. Yeats and T.S. Eliot, among others. Other notables were R.D. Symons who emigrated to Canada at age 16 where he became an author, rancher, game warden, naturalist, and painter of wildlife, . and Dom Thomas Symons who was a composer, choirmaster, translator, and teacher. . Major General Sir Thomas-Henry Symons, KBE,CSI, was the Director General of the Indian Medical Services from 1926– 1930, . and the Very Rev. Charles Douglas Symons, CB,MC, DD, MA, was the Chaplain General to the Forces during World War II and Honorary Chaplain to the King. In the late 1820s, Samuel Symons, a timber merchant and land agent of Wadebridge, built Doyden Castle, a truncated Gothic tower on Doyden Point near Port Quin to entertain his friends. Symons family descendants are still landholders in Cornwall, as for example of Trevathan Farm in St.Endellion, continuously worked by the family since 1857. Acland In 1802, Trerice and other estates including Ebbingford Manor (Efford) in Stratton, near Bude in Cornwall, and Selworthy and Luccombe in Somerset, passed to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet (1787–1871), of Killerton in Devon and Holnicote in Somerset.Acland, Anne.

Above it is Efford Down, on which in 1835 the 10th Baronet built the surviving octagonal tower known as the \\"Storm Tower\\", whose sides face the cardinal and sub-cardinal points of the compass. It was designed by George Wightwick, inspired by the Tower of the Winds in Athens, and is believed to have served as a refuge for coastguards. In 1826 the 10th Baronet also built at Bude the \\"Falcon Hotel\\", named after the Acland crest of a falcon perched on a man's gloved hand. The Cornish estates were however difficult to manage economically as they were so far from Killerton, near Exeter.Acland, Anne. A Devon Family: The Story of the Aclands. London and Chichester: Phillimore, 1981, pp. 61, 139 Shortly before 1844 the 10th Baronet restored the Great Hall and the Chamber at Trerice and in 1844 the local newspaper reported \\"Sir T. D. Acland held his Baronial Court at Trerice ... about 150 of his tenantry dined with the worthy Baronet in the noble Hall at Trerice, which has recently been restored to its original condition, and is a very fine specimen of the Elizabethan age\\". The Aclands later leased Trerice with 500 acres to the Tremaine family, who farmed the estate with a staff of twelve men, four women and four boys. In 1915 Trerice was sold by the 10th baronet's grandson Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 12th Baronet (1842–1919)Acland, Anne. A Devon Family: The Story of the Aclands.

Elton restored the house, which included rebuilding the partially demolished north wing, but spent about £60,000, three times more than expected. Elton left Trerice in 1965 following the death of his wife, and subsequently built a bungalow called Fairlie Lodge, in Shackleford, Surrey. Following his death in 1980 the bungalow was sold.

Biography Thompson was the elder of two daughters of a prominent Philadelphia family. Her father was attorney Charles Henry Burr Jr. and her mother was novelist and biographer Anna Robeson Brown. Her grandfather was noted orator and lawyer Henry Armitt Brown. Early in life Thompson studied the Classics, attending Miss Hill's School in Center City, Pa., and The Latin School in Philadelphia. She began her study of Latin at age 9 and ancient Greek at 12. At age 13, she took a Grand Tour of Europe, visiting museums and monuments of Europe. In 1919 she began her studies at Bryn Mawr College where she took courses with Rhys Carpenter and Mary Hamilton Swindler. She graduated summa cum laude in 1923, the first graduate with a major in Greek and archaeology, and was awarded the college's European Fellowship. She used the fellowship to study at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, works on excavations with Carl Blegen at Phlius. In 1925 Thompson discovered a tholos tomb that proved to be the burial place of the king and queen of Midea. She completed her Ph.D. at Bryn Mawr College in 1931; it entailed a study of the 117 Hellenistic terracotta figures from Myrina in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Dorothy Burr Thompson with her excavation crew at the Athenian Agora, 1933 In 1932 Thompson was appointed the first female Fellow of the Athenian Agora excavations.Dorothy Burr Thompson papers, ASCSA.edu; retrieved October 2, 2016. The dig's assistant director of field work was the Canadian archaeologist Homer Thompson; the two married in 1934. Homer Thompson accepted positions as curator of the classical collection at the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology and assistant professor in fine arts at the University of Toronto. Burr Thompson had three daughters between 1935 and 1938, but found time to remain involved during the same period in the Athenian Agora excavations, where she discovered the garden of the Temple of Hephaistos in 1936. In 1946 her husband accepted a chair at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and Burr Thompson served as acting director of the Royal Ontario Museum until she moved to Princeton, New Jersey the following year. At Princeton she continued to publish and carry out her research. She published the book An Ancient Shopping Center: The Athenian Agora in 1971. In 1987 she was awarded the Gold Medal for distinguished achievement by the Archaeological Institute of America. She died in Hightstown, New Jersey and is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery.

Salters Steamers, formerly known as Salter Bros, is a family boating firm on the River Thames, founded in Oxford in 1858. Prior to that the family operated a riverside tavern in Wandsworth, having moved there around 1836. The company runs passenger services in summer along the length of the River Thames between Oxford and Staines. They also hire boats from Oxford (at Folly Bridge), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. In Oxford in particular, punts are available. History The firm was established when John and Stephen Salter took over Isaac King's boat building firm based at Folly Bridge in Oxford. They were the country's leading racing- boat-builder in the 1860s (distributing craft around the world) and they built many of the beautiful Oxford University barges at Christ Church Meadow, used over many years as a base for the various colleges for the sport of rowing. These have now all been replaced by boat houses. They became one of the largest inland boat-letters in the country by the late 1880s and in the twentieth century they built many pleasure craft for corporations and councils around the country. On the death of John Salter, the firm passed to his three sons (John, James and George) and become known as Salter Bros. John and James rose to considerable prominence in Oxford as long-standing local Liberal politicians (both serving as Mayors of Oxford) and well-known Wesleyan Methodists. In 1888, the company started a steam boat service between Oxford and Kingston upon Thames, using the boat Alaska. Alaska was built in 1883 as a private vessel but was purchased in 1886 by Salters who used her from 1888 to start their Oxford to Kingston return service. Alaska is still operating today under the management of Thames Steamers Limited. By the turn of the century the firm was the largest passenger boat operator on the non-tidal Thames, helped by its close association with the Great Western Railway with which it ran numerous circular tours. The service between Oxford and Kingston operated until the 1970s. The return journey originally took five days (two days downstream and three days upstream), but was shortened to four in the 1890s. When the through service became uneconomic the company concentrated on local services between Folly Bridge, Oxford and Abingdon, Reading and Henley, Marlow and Windsor and Windsor and Staines. The firm was one of the most important businesses on the river for popularising pleasure boating on the non-tidal Thames. It is still owned and run by family members (the fifth and sixth generation), but the parent company is now primarily concerned with property management. Current services More recently, Salters passenger services have been reintroduced between Abingdon, Wallingford and Reading, and between Henley and Marlow. Through journeys are therefore again possible, with changes of boats. The journey between Oxford and Staines takes 4 days. Original steamer Two original 'Salters Steamers' have been restored to full working order as a steam-powered excursion trip boats working from Runnymede and Windsor, on the Thames. The SL Nuneham, built by Edwin Clarke in 1898 and the SL Streatley, built by Salters in Oxford in 1905, which retains her original triple expansion engine.

Its original German title is Der Streit um den Sergeanten Grischa. It is part of Zweig's hexalogy Der große Krieg der weißen Männer (The great war of white men). It was part of the so-called \\"war book boom\\" of the late 1920s, during which many veterans of the First World War turned their memories and experiences into semi-autobiographical novels. The first English edition was published in 1928. The book is a satire, focusing on the way in which innocent men are sacrificed in war, one irony being that the authorities spend more time and energy on the niceties of Grischa's case than they do on trying to save their own soldiers from their fate. Some major actors in the war are feebly disguised: General Ludendorff is \\"Schieffenzahn\\", the politician Matthias Erzberger is \\"Deputy Hemmerle\\", General Max Hoffmann is \\"Clauss\\", and Field Marshal von Eichorn is \\"von Lychow\\". The first film based on the novel was created in 1930 in the USA; a second one was made in Germany in 1968. East German television aired a mini-series based on the novel in 1970.Der Streit um den Sergeanten Grischa (TV 1970). IMDB.com Plot The Russian soldier Grischa escapes from a German prison camp and attempts to return to the family home. After his escape he becomes involved with a group of outlaws, including a young woman, Babka, who dresses as a man and has been prematurely aged by her traumatic experiences. Grischa and Babka become lovers. When he leaves, she gives him the identity tag of a former lover, Bjuscheff, so that if he gets caught he will be mistaken for a deserter and not be sent back to the prison camp. She follows him at a distance in case he ever needs her help. Grischa is eventually captured. Being illiterate, he does not realise that calling himself Bjuscheff worsens his plight, as he has been unable to read the notices saying that all deserters must hand themselves in to the occupying German army within three days or face execution as spies. Only when he is condemned to death does he realise what has happened, and he reveals his true identity. The local German authorities send for his former prison guards, and having confirmed his true identity, they send for advice to Schieffenzahn, the chief administrator on the eastern Front. Schieffenzahn orders that the original error must be ignored, for the sake of discipline. Grischa is therefore sentenced to be shot. There follows a power struggle between the local military authorities and the administrators. The old general sees it as a point of honour not to give in to Schieffenzahn's order. Although he fails to convince Schieffenzahn face to face, the latter thinks better of it afterwards and rescinds the execution order. However, a heavy snowfall has brought down the communication wires, and the telegram of reprieve is never sent. In the meantime, Babka hatches a plan to poison the prison guards, whilst Lieutenant Winfried, the general's nephew, tries to find alternative ways of getting Grischa out of prison. Both plans fail because Grischa himself is tired of the struggle and refuses to leave, preferring to face execution rather than continue as a pawn in the larger game.

This includes pneumonia, conjunctivitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis, and sinusitis. It is used by mouth, by injection into a vein, or as an eye drop. Common side effects include diarrhea, dizziness, and headache. Severe side effects may include spontaneous tendon ruptures, nerve damage, and worsening of myasthenia gravis. Safety of use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is unclear. Moxifloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. It usually results in bacterial death through blocking their ability to duplicate DNA. Moxifloxacin was patented in 1988 and approved for use in the United States in 1999. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Medical uses Moxifloxacin is used to treat a number of infections, including: respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, anthrax, intra-abdominal infections, endocarditis, meningitis, and tuberculosis. In the United States, moxifloxacin is licensed for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated intra- abdominal infections. In the European Union, it is licensed for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, non-severe community-acquired pneumonia, and acute bacterial sinusitis. Based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the by mouth (but not the IV) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. In the US, the marketing approval does not contain these restrictions, though the label contains prominent warnings against skin reactions. The initial approval by the FDA (December 1999) encompassed these indications: * Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis * Acute bacterial sinusitis * Community acquired pneumonia Additional indications approved by the FDA are: * April 2001: Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections * May 2004: Community acquired pneumonia caused by multidrug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae * June 2005: Complicated skin and skin structure infections * November 2005: Complicated intra-abdominal infections The European Medicines Agency has advised that for pneumonia, acute bacterial sinusitis, and acute exacerbations of COPD, it should only be used when other antibiotics are inappropriate. No uses within the pediatric population for oral and intravenous moxifloxacin have been approved. A significant number of drugs found within this class, including moxifloxacin, are not licensed by the FDA for use in children due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system. Moxifloxacin is approved for the treatment of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria. =Susceptible bacteria= A broad spectrum of bacteria is susceptible, including: * Staphylococcus aureus * Staphylococcus epidermidis * Streptococcus pneumoniae * Haemophilus influenzae * Klebsiella spp. * Moraxella catarrhalis * Enterobacter spp. * Mycobacterium spp. * Bacillus anthracis * Mycoplasma genitalium Adverse effects Rare but serious adverse effects that may occur as a result of moxifloxacin therapy include irreversible peripheral neuropathy, spontaneous tendon rupture and tendonitis, hepatitis, psychiatric effects (hallucinations, depression), torsades de pointes, Stevens–Johnson syndrome and Clostridium difficile-associated disease, and photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions. Several reports suggest the use of moxifloxacin may lead to uveitis. =Pregnancy and breastfeeding= Exposure of the developing fetus to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight. There is limited data about the appearance of moxifloxacin in human breastmilk. Animal studies have found that moxifloxacin appears in significant concentration in breastmilk. Decisions as to whether to continue therapy during pregnancy or while breast feeding should take the potential risk of harm to the fetus or child into account, as well as the importance of the drug to the well being of the mother. Contraindications Only two listed contraindications are found within the 2008 package insert: * \\"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Although not observed with moxifloxacin in preclinical and clinical trials, the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions.\\" * \\"Moxifloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, or any of the product components.\\" Though not stated as such within the package insert, ziprasidone is also considered to be contraindicated, as it may have the potential to prolong QT interval. Moxifloxacin should also be avoided in patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, or concurrent administration of other medications known to prolong the QT interval (antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants). Moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients suffering from diabetes, as glucose regulation may be significantly altered. Moxifloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with a history of tendon disorder, patients with documented QT prolongation, and patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. Coadministration of moxifloxacin with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval or induce bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, amiodarone) should be avoided. Careful consideration should be given in the use of moxifloxacin in patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with conduction abnormalities. =Pediatric population= The safety of moxifloxacin in children under age 18 has not been established. Animal studies suggest the potential for musculoskeletal harm in juveniles. Interactions Moxifloxacin is not believed to be associated with clinically significant drug interactions due to inhibition or stimulation of hepatic metabolism. Thus, it should not, for the most part, require special clinical or laboratory monitoring to ensure its safety. Moxifloxacin has a potential for a serious drug interaction with NSAIDs. The combination of corticosteroids and moxifloxacin has increased potential to result in tendonitis and disability. Antacids containing aluminium or magnesium ions inhibit the absorption of moxifloxacin. Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., pimozide) may have an additive effect on QT prolongation and lead to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The international normalised ratio may be increased or decreased in patients treated with warfarin. Overdose \\"In the event of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied and adequate hydration maintained. ECG monitoring is recommended due to the possibility of QT interval prolongation. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. The administration of activated charcoal as soon as possible after oral overdose may prevent excessive increase of systemic moxifloxacin exposure. About 3% and 9% of the dose of moxifloxacin, as well as about 2% and 4.5% of its glucuronide metabolite are removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, respectively.\\" (Quoting from the 29 December 2008 package insert for Avelox) Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram- positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase IV, enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell replication. =Pharmacokinetics= About 52% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. The cytochrome P450 system is not involved in moxifloxacin metabolism, and is not affected by moxifloxacin. The sulfate conjugate (M1) accounts for around 38% of the dose, and is eliminated primarily in the feces. Approximately 14% of an oral or intravenous dose is converted to a glucuronide conjugate (M2), which is excreted exclusively in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of M2 are about 40% those of the parent drug, while plasma concentrations of M1 are, in general, less than 10% those of moxifloxacin. In vitro studies with cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit 80 CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2, suggesting that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in pediatric subjects have not been studied. The elimination half-life of moxifloxacin is 11.5 to 15.6 hours (single-dose, oral). About 45% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is excreted as unchanged drug (about 20% in urine and 25% in feces). A total of 96 ± 4% of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites. The mean (± SD) apparent total body clearance and renal clearance are 12 ± 2 L/h and 2.6 ± 0.5 L/h, respectively. The CSF penetration of moxifloxacin is 70% to 80% in patients with meningitis. Chemistry Moxifloxacin monohydrochloride is a slightly yellow to yellow crystalline substance. It is synthesized in several steps, the first involving the preparation of racemic 2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane which is then resolved using tartaric acid. A suitably derivatised quinolinecarboxylic acid is then introduced, in the presence of DABCO, followed by acidification to form moxifloxacin hydrochloride. History Moxifloxacin was first patented (United States patent) in 1991 by Bayer A.G., and again in 1997. Avelox was subsequently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States in 1999 to treat specific bacterial infections. Ranking 140th within the top 200 prescribed drugs in the United States for 2007, Avelox generated sales of $697.3 million worldwide. Moxifloxacin is also manufactured by Alcon as Vigamox. =Patent= A United States patent application was made on 30 June 1989, for Avelox, Bayer A.G. being the assignee, which was subsequently approved on 5 February 1991. This patent was scheduled to expire on 30 June 2009. However, this patent was extended for an additional two and one half years on 16 September 2004, and as such was not expected to expire until 2012. Moxifloxacin was subsequently (ten years later) approved by the FDA for use in the United States in 1999. At least four additional United States patents have been filed regarding moxifloxacin hydrochloride since the 1989 United States application,US 4990517 A (Feb 1991) Petersen et al.

Society and culture =Regulatory actions= Regulatory agencies have taken actions to address certain rare but serious adverse events associated with moxifloxacin therapy. Based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the IV) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. Similarly, the Canadian label includes a warning of the risk of liver injury.Updated Labeling for Antibiotic Avelox (Moxifloxacin) Regarding Risk of Severe Liver Injury / Information Update: 2010-42 For immediate release 22 March 2010 http://www.hc- sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2010/2010_42-eng.php The U.S. label does not contain restrictions similar to the European label, but a carries a \\"black box\\" warning of the risk of tendon damage and/or rupture and warnings regarding the risk of irreversible peripheral neuropathy. =Generic equivalents= In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware held that two Bayer patents on Avelox are valid and enforceable, and infringed by Dr. Reddy's ANDA for a generic version of Avelox. The district court sided with Bayer, citing the Federal Circuit's prior decision in Takeda v. Alphapharm as \\"affirming the district court's finding that defendant failed to prove a prima facie case of obviousness where the prior art disclosed a broad selection of compounds, any one of which could have been selected as a lead compound for further investigation, and defendant did not prove that the prior art would have led to the selection of the particular compound singled out by defendant.\\" According to Bayer's press release announcing the court's decision, it was noted that Teva had also challenged the validity of the same Bayer patents at issue in the Dr. Reddy's case. Within Bayer's first-quarter 2008 stockholder's newsletter Bayer stated that they had reached an agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., the adverse party, to settle their patent litigation with regard to the two Bayer patents. Under the settlement terms agreed upon, Teva would obtain a license to sell its generic moxifloxacin tablet product in the U.S. shortly before the second of the two Bayer patents expires in March 2014. In Bangladesh, it is available with brand name of Optimox.

It is a native of the scrubby hills of California, and is a common member of chaparral ecosystems. Description Quercus berberidifolia grows to 1-2 meters (40-80 inches) tall, rarely to or 13 feet), and has sharply toothed, dull green leaves which are long and broad, leathery on their top surfaces and somewhat hairy underneath. The solitary or paired brown acorns are long and broad, and pointed or egg-shaped with thin caps when mature; they mature in about 6-8 months after pollination. In cooler, more exposed areas, scrub oak is usually a small, compact shrub, but in warm or sheltered areas the plant can spread out and grow several meters high. The epithet berberidifolia means \\"barberry- leaved,\\" referring to the spiny leaf margins characteristic of Q. berberidifolia as well as of several species of Berberis. Other species Often known simply as scrub oak, though this name is also applied to other Quercus species, especially several which were formerly grouped under the single name Q. dumosa, all are found in scrubby habitats. Many other scrub- type oaks may be found in these regions, and careful inspection is required to identify individuals of Q. berberidifolia and its hybrids. Quercus berberidifolia sometimes hybridizes with other species. Chaparral origins The word chaparral is derived from the Spanish word for scrub oak, chaparro. The non-specific meaning of the term is 'short in stature.' Because most scrub vegetation is rather low growing, the term is broadly applied to all of the vegetation in \\"chaparral\\" communities.

Kinship Relations in Machiguenga, pp. 17-25.Johnson, Allen W. Families of the Forest: The Matsigenka Indians of the Peruvian Amazon. University of California Press, 2003. pp. 9-10. Retrieved from Google Books on April 1, 2012. . The Machiguenga are classified as animists in religion. Their traditional nomadic lifestyle, that they are a \\"walking\\" people, is integral to and justified by their cosmogony. Family life The average tribal woman marries around age 16, and often kin marry each other. Women have an average of eight to ten pregnancies. As with many indigenous tribes, the mortality rate for infants is high. It is a patriarchal and sometimes polygamous society; men may have multiple wives. During meals, men are always served and eat first, while the women and children divide what remains. While quite accomplished in using plants and herbs as medicine, the Machiguenga are susceptible to new infectious diseases brought in from the outside world. The tribespeople wear a handwoven and homemade cotton tunic made by women, called a cushmas, designed with a V neck for men, and straight neck for women. They fashion huts using palm tree poles as a frame, with palm leaves thatched for the roof. Literacy rates for settled groups range from 30% to 60%. Each extended family group is governed by a self-appointed \\"headman\\". Language The Machiguenga language belongs to the Campa group of Machi puceran Maipurean (Arawakan) language family, which is spoken by approximately 12,000 people in Peru. There are two dialects of Machiguenga: Machiguenga proper and Nomatsiguenga. Caquinte is also spoken, but is considered a distinctly different language.

Folly Bridge is a stone bridge over the River Thames carrying the Abingdon Road south from the centre of Oxford, England. It was erected in 1825–27, to designs of a little-known architect, Ebenezer Perry (died 1850), who practised in London.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840, 3rd ed., 1995 (Yale University Press), s.v. \\"Ebenezer Perry\\". The bridge is in two parts separated by an island. The origin of the name is uncertainThe Gentleman's Magazine, August 1829:105, which gave an engraving of the old bridge and the tower reputed to contain the study of Roger Bacon. although it has been suggested that it originated about 1650 after a tenant of Bacon's study.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 — republished 1968 David & Charles History The old \\"Friar Bacon's Study\\". \\"Grand Pont\\" from upstream. The island and \\"South Bridge\\" from upstream. The bridge apparently stands at the site of the ford over which oxen could be driven across the Isis, the ancient name of the Thames in the Oxford area. The first known stone bridge on the site was built by Robert d'Oilli in around 1085, but there was believed to be a wooden bridge in the time of Ethelred of Wessex. Remains of the Saxon structure may still be seen beneath the present bridge. Until the late 17th century the bridge was known as South Bridge, and formed part of a long causeway known as Grandpont, which stretched along most of the line of Abingdon Road.Victoria County History of Oxfordshire, Volume 4: Communications: Bridges In the 13th century, the alchemist Roger Bacon lived and worked at \\"Friar Bacon's Study\\" which stood across the north end of the bridge until 1779, when it was removed to widen the road. Samuel Pepys visited Bacon's study in 1669, noting: \\"So to Friar Bacon's study: I up and saw it, and gave the man 1s\\". In 1369, when there was a grant of pontage on \\"Grauntpount\\", the structure was said to be \\"so dangerous as to be well nigh impassable\\". A toll-booth gateway tower used to straddle the approach to the bridge, which was on the Abingdon to Banbury turnpike. The former bridge and \\"Bacon's Tower\\" were drawn by many artists, including the twelve-year-old J. M. W. Turner.Bridge and Bacon's Tower, Oxford 1787\\", pen and ink and watercolour, Tate Gallery. There was also a weir underneath the bridge which had a flash lock and later a \\"pen\\" lock. At the beginning of the 19th century this and the poor state of the bridge itself constituted a problem for navigation. Surveys discovered that the foundations were in a very bad state, and in 1815 an Act of Parliament was obtained to rebuild the bridge and remove the \\"Tackle and Works\\" underneath. The new bridge works were begun in 1824 and completed in 1827. A pound lock was established nearby in about 1832, which was removed in 1884. The bridge is Grade I listed. The toll house was rebuilt in 1844 and is now, along with the bridge, also Grade II listed; tolls on the bridge were abolished in 1850. A scheme for a public footbridge next to the bridge was designed by Nicholas Grimshaw & Partners but was not built.Grimshaw. Folly Bridge, 1996. Environs Castellated house at Folly Bridge (in 1979). The house was built in 1849 for the mathematician Joshua Cardwell. Robert Gunther, the historian of science, bought 5 Folly Bridge, an unusual castellated house by the bridge, in 1911.A. V. Simcock (editor), Robert T. Gunther and the Old Ashmolean. Oxford: Museum of the History of Science, 1985, page 60. The house is embellished with statues and cast iron balconies on the outside. It is located on a small island in the middle of the Thames. Salters Steamers are located near the bridge. Punts are available close to the bridge and Christ Church Meadow is just downstream. The Head of the River public house is next to the bridge to the northeast, with views of the bridge and river.  Literature  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland originated as a story told on a boating trip which began at Folly Bridge.

A she-bear that was being held at the nearby amphitheatre attacked the guard and saved her. Aurelian wanted both Columba and the she-bear burnt alive, but the bear escaped and rain put out the fire, so he had her beheaded, near a fountain called d'Azon.Capes, Florence. \\"St. Columba of Sens.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Other churches in France have borne her name. =Patronage= Columba became the patroness of Andorra. She is said to have been patroness of the parish church of Chevilly, in the diocese of Paris. =Iconography= Saint Columba is portrayed as a crowned maiden in chains. At times she may have a dog or bear on a chain, hold a book and a peacock's feather, be with an angel on a funeral pyre, or be beheaded. Saint Comba Veneration of \\"Saint Comba\\" in Galicia dates from the Middle Ages; her cult, according to Allyson M.

These were Columba of Sens and Columba of Spain. A Galician legend held that before becoming a virtuous virgin martyr, Comba was a witch. This legend relates that one day, the witch Comba, encountering Jesus Christ on a Galician road, changed her life after Christ remarked, “Go ahead and be the witch, but you will not enter my kingdom.” The tale states that Comba converted to Christianity and was martyred for her faith after refusing to deny it, or after refusing the sexual advances of men. She became the patron saint of witches in Galicia, acting both as an intercessor on behalf of witches and as an intercessor against witches.Allyson M. Poska, Women and Authority in Early Modern Spain: The Peasants of Galicia (Oxford University Press, 2005), 224-25. At Coimbra, according to one 19th century travel guide, there was a small chapel that was said to mark the spot where Comba suffered martyrdom, and that \\"towards the close of the spring, the young girls of Coimbra deck her shrine with wreaths of roses in remembrance of the rosy crown of martyrdom they believe she won.\\"A C Smith, A Handbook for Travellers in Portugal (J.

When it was first published in the summer of 2005, it garnered international headlines for the eerie similarity of its plot to the 7 July 2005 London bombings in England carried out on the same day it was published. It won the 2005 Book-of-the- Month Club First Fiction Award. A 2008 film with the same name was based on it.  Narrative  The novel is written as an epistolary first-person novel, in which, the main character, a young mother, writes a letter to Osama bin Laden after a London incendiary bombing.  Plot summary  A young mother's life is blown apart when her husband and four-year-old son are killed during a bombing at a football match. Following this, the young mother falls into a depression. While the young mother tries to battle her depression, she also must fight the guilt of committing adultery the same day of her son's and husband's death.  Critical reception  The novel received generally positive reviews. The Washington Post called it \\"A mezmering tour de force\\". New York Times said it was \\"As benefits good genre fiction, Cleave's characters are sustained, driven and informed by the plot, which dictates and governs all\\".https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/books/review/incendiary-dear- osama.html It also is considered to be \\"strong, intelligent, heart-breaking and realistic. The author said that principally, the novel is about the feelings of a mother for its children and the aftermath of a terrorist attack.  Film adaptation  The film, loosely based on the book, was released in the UK on Friday, October 24, 2008. It was directed by Sharon Maguire and starring Michelle Williams in the main role, supported by Ewan McGregor as Jasper Black, and Matthew MacFadyen as Terrence Butcher.

It concerns the aftermath of the Nazi era in Europe, and how the fall of the Berlin Wall in the late 1980s affected those who once saw Communism as a way forward for society. The main characters travel to France, where they encounter disturbing residues of Nazism still at large in the French countryside. Critical reception was polarized.  Reception  Black Dogs divided critics. M. John Harrison of The Times Literary Supplement lauded the book as \\"compassionate without resorting to sentimentality, clever without losing its honesty, an undisguised novel of ideas which is also Ian McEwan's most human work.\\" Poet Craig Raine billed it as \\"a novel whose formal perfection was so subtle that most critics failed to notice.\\" An anonymous reviewer in The Observer declared Black Dogs to be McEwan's best book yet, as did Andrew Billen. In Entertainment Weekly, writer Gary Giddens said, \\"McEwan's narratives are small and focused, but resonate far into the night.\\"Gary Giddens, \\"Black Dogs,\\" Entertainment Weekly, 16 October 1992. A writer for Kirkus Reviews stated, \\"McEwan explores the personal consequences of political ideas in this remarkably precise little novel. His lapidary prose neatly disguises his search for transcendence.” A reviewer for Publishers Weekly argued that for some the pivotal scene may be unconvincing because McEwan \\"is rather too didactic in the exposition of his theme”. However, the reviewer also said the work remains \\"impressive; McEwan's meticulous prose, his shaping of his material to create suspense, and his adept use of specific settings [...] produce a haunting fable about the fragility of civilization, always threatened by the cruelty latent in humankind.” Edward P. McBride of The Harvard Crimson praised McEwan's psychological insight and argued, “Black Dogs challenges us to confront the tension we all feel in the meeting of science and religion, the rational and the irrational. McEwan crafts the work subtly, weaving the same uncertainty through prose and plot.” In the London Review of Books, Graham Coster complained that the final section's authoritative account is inconsistent with the \\"relativistic collage of verdicts over the preceding pages\\", and also criticized certain climactic encounters for the novel's narrator as areas where \\"McEwan’s metaphysical inquiry shrinks to [...] a knowing wink of, You can’t rule it out, can you?\\" But Coster also described the philosophical conflict between Bernard and June as a source of considerable pathos, and wrote that the author \\"shares Forster's sensitivity to landscape as a numinous protagonist [...] McEwan’s prose evokes [the menacing environment where June is attacked] with tender precision.” In The New York Times, critic Michiko Kakutani stated that \\"McEwan dexterously opens out his story onto a political and philosophical level\\" but skates briskly over these larger implications of the story after doing so. Kakutani said that the reader is ultimately “intrigued and provoked but also vaguely undernourished\\", describing the novel as \\"absorbing yet vexing”.Michiko Kakutani, \\"How a Family Story Describes Europe,\\" New York Times, 3 November 1992 Amanda Craig wrote in the Literary Review that while Black Dogs had potential to be \\"a pleasing essay on the ambiguous nature of memory and desire, or the real and the ideal,\\" it ultimately \\"gets lost in portentous [...] polemic.\\" James Saynor of The Observer derided the book as \\"wan and fractured\\" and the characterization as \\"schematic\\". Conversely, Zadie Smith in 2005 dubbed Black Dogs a \\"brilliant, flinty little novel, bursting with big ideas\\". The following year, Roger Boylan wrote that the novel is \\"the most thought-provoking\\" of McEwan's books and that it deserved the Booker Prize more than Amsterdam (1998). Academic Bob Corbett lauded the novel in 2016 as \\"a disturbing, challenging, chilling and gripping read. [...] It touches me in a very personal manner.\\" In 2018, Tina Jordan and Susan Ellingwood of The New York Times listed it as one of McEwan's six \\"noteworthy\\" works.

In 1997 it was merged with the Yerevan Chamber Orchestra to form the new NCOA. As of September 2010 the Principal Conductor and Music Director is Vahan Mardirossian. In April 1997, Armenia’s Ministry of Culture extended a special invitation to American-Armenian conductor Aram Gharabekian and appointed him as Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of the newly formed National Chamber Orchestra of Armenia. The twenty-five members of the NCOA exemplify the finest chamber music players in Armenia who are all graduates of the Komitas Conservatory in Yerevan. Events The NCOA has appeared on tour with remarkable praise in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, Greece, Russia, Georgia, Cyprus, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates. Gharabekian also has led the NCOA to notable performances in the Canterbury Festival in England, the Halle Festival in Germany, and the Dimitria Festival in Greece. For their outstanding achievements Aram Gharabekian and NCOA have been duly recognized in a special proclamation by the United States Congress and televised features on CNN Special and Russian Kultura TV channel. Under the patronage of the First Ladies of Germany and Armenia, Gharabekian and NCOA officially opened the international celebrations honoring Aram Khachaturian’s 100th anniversary in Berlin, and have been honored with a special concert at the Presidential Palace in Nicosia in Cyprus. The NCOA is the only performing ensemble in Armenia that is committed to a significant outreach program, Taking Music to the People, which offers free-of-charge performances to the regions of Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh, every season. During the last decade the NCOA has commissioned and premiered more than 40 new works and encouraged the integration of traditional Armenian musical instruments such as duduk, zurna, shvi and kamancha in the works specially written for the orchestra. Media releases Gharabekian and NCOA have recorded three CD albums of works by Armenian composers and have released two DVDs of live open-air performances by the magnificent backdrop of historic sites of Garni Temple (1st century AD) and Zvartnots Complex (7th century AD). The NCOA Gala Open-Air Concert DVD recorded live at the Garni temple in 2004 has been recognized with a special diploma at 2005 ECO-ETNO-FOLK Film Festival in Bucharest, Romania.

Carpenter was unconventional as a scholar. He analyzed Greek art from the standpoint of artistic production and behavior. He argued for dating the Greek alphabet to the eighth century B.C.  Early life and career  Carpenter was born in Cotuit, Massachusetts in 1889. He received his B.A. in Classics from Columbia University in 1909. Carpenter won a Rhodes scholarship at the University of Oxford, studying at Balliol College. There he published his own poetry and earned a second B.A. (1911), upgraded to an M.A. in 1914. He spent the year 1912–13 at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. The president of Bryn Mawr College, Martha Carey Thomas (1857–1935) invited Carpenter to establish a department of classical archaeology at the college, which he did while completing his own graduate work at Columbia University; he completed his Ph.D. in 1916 with a dissertation on The Ethics of Euripides. By 1918 he was already a full professor at Bryn Mawr. In 1918 Carpenter married Eleanor Houston Hill. In 1926 Carpenter became professor at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, and established the school's journal, Hesperia in 1932. He also was instrumental in the planning of the American excavations of the agora in Athens. He returned to teaching at Bryn Mawr College and also delivered the Martin Classical Lectures at Oberlin College, which appeared in print as The Humanistic Value of Archaeology (1933). He delivered the Sather lectures in 1946 on \\"Folk tale, fiction, and saga in the Homeric epics.\\"  Retirement  Carpenter retired in 1955. In his retirement he held visiting professorships at the University of Pennsylvania (1960), was Andrew W. Mellon professor at the University of Pittsburgh (1961–62), and visiting scholar at the University of Washington (1963–64). He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America in 1969. Dr. Carpenter, one year before his death, was forced from his estate \\"Jerry Run\\" by the government so Marsh Creek State Park lake could be built.  Death  He died in Devon, Pennsylvania in 1980.Mellink, Machteld J. , Robert Whallon and Patty Jo Watson. 1980. \\"Necrology.\\" American Journal of Archaeology 84.2:260-261.

The geographical approach to materials in the Library of Congress subject headings: report of a study project. s.l.: s.n., 1960. [Accession No: ]. The geographical aspect of a subject may be conveyed through three types of headings labeled A, B, and C. Heading A uses a primary topical description with geographical subdivisions (e.g. Art—Paris). Type B uses a place-name for the main heading with a topical subdivision (e.g. Paris—Description). C headings use a geographical description of a phrase (e.g. Paris Literature). Brinkler explores what type of heading is more useful to a patron, and he finds that it depends on the level of familiarity a patron has with a topic and what approach they take when searching for resources on their topic. Ideally readers will either be looking for everything on a particular topic, or everything regarding a particular place. Bartol Brinkler investigates a system of classification that will best serve these two ideal types of patrons. He finds working with Type A headings will best assist a patron who is more topic oriented, while using Type B headings is preferable for those who are primarily interested in one place. However this is problematic in practice. One possibility is to assign Type A and Type B headings to every resource, but the cataloguing cost would be high. A system that aids readers regardless of their approach to a topic involves using cross-references (e.g. Canada—Botany, See Botany—Canada). Admitting that see and see also references would require more work on the part of librarians, Bartol Brinkler notes that librarians must keep in mind \\"...readers do not have the same knowledge [of classification] and do need all the help they can get...\\" References *Brinkler, Bartol.

An error message is information displayed when an unforeseen problem occurs, usually on a computer or other device. On modern operating systems with graphical, error messages are often displayed using dialog boxes. Error messages are used when user intervention is required, to indicate that a desired operation has failed, or to relay important warnings (such as warning a computer user that they are almost out of hard disk space). Error messages are seen widely throughout computing, and are part of every operating system or computer hardware device. Proper design of error messages is an important topic in usability and other fields of human–computer interaction.  Common error messages  The following error messages are commonly seen by modern computer users: ;Access denied :This error occurs if the user doesn't have privileges to a file, or if it has been locked by some program or user. ;Device not ready :This error most often occurs when there is no floppy disk (or a bad disk) in the disk drive and the system tries to perform tasks involving this disk. ;File not found :The file concerned may have been damaged, moved, deleted, or a bug may have caused the error. Alternatively, the file simply might not exist, or the user has mistyped its name. More frequent on command line interfaces than on graphical user interfaces where files are presented iconically and users do not type file names. ;Low Disk Space :This error occurs when the hard drive is (nearly) full. To fix this, the user should close some programs (to free swap file usage) and delete some files (normally temporary files, or other files after they have been backed up), or get a bigger hard drive. ;Out of memory :This error occurs when the system has run out of memory or tries to load a file too large to store in RAM. The fix is to close some programs or install more memory. ;[program name] has stopped working. :This message is displayed by Microsoft Windows 10 when a program causes a general protection fault or invalid page fault.  Notable error messages  * Abort, Retry, Fail? - A notoriously confusing error message seen in MS-DOS An example of an Error message .vbs script * Bad command or file name - Another notoriously common and confusing error message seen in MS-DOS * The Blue Screen of Death - On Microsoft Windows and ReactOS operating systems, this screen appears when Windows or ReactOS can no longer run because of a severe error. It is roughly analogous to a kernel panic on Linux, Unix or Mac OS X. * Can't extend - an error message from Acorn DFS. DFS stores files in non-fragmented contiguous disk space, this error is caused when trying to extend an open random-access file into space that is already occupied by another file. * Guru Meditation - an error message from the Commodore Amiga, roughly analogous to a kernel panic or Blue Screen of Death, also adopted by more recent products such as VirtualBox * HTTP 404 - A file not found error seen on the World Wide Web, usually resulting from a link to a page that has been moved or deleted, or a mistyped URL * lp0 on fire - A Unix warning that the printer may be on fire * Not a typewriter - A Unix error message that is confusing due to its now obsolete use of the word typewriter, and which is sometimes output when the nature of error is seemingly entirely different * PC LOAD LETTER - An error on several HP laser printers that simply asked the user to add \\"Letter\\" size paper in a confusing way * SYNTAX ERROR - Seen on many computer systems when the received instructions are in a format they don't understand * HTTP 504 - An error found on the World Wide Web stating that a gateway timeout occurred in the internet link. * Error 1603 - An error that states that a problem during installation of a computer program, this error particularly occurs on Windows computer systems. * <application name> has stopped - An error message commonly found on Android devices, which states a current running application unexpectedly stops working or crashes. * Success - one of the error messages (in this instance, POSIX) that occurs when the program has detected an error condition, yet the actual error message printing routine relies on C library to print the error reported by the operating system (in this case, errno.h), while the underlying system calls have succeeded and report no errors (in this case, \`errno  0\`). This is a form of sloppy error handling that is particularly confusing for the users. * [Connection Time Out Error Mac] - Error occurs on Mac systems when it takes more time to connect wireless.  Fail pets  Tumbeasts gnawing on servers, used by Tumblr in 2011 With the rise of Web 2.0 services such as Twitter, end-user facing error messages such as HTTP 404 and HTTP 500 started to be displayed with whimsical characters, termed Fail Pets or Error Mascots. The term \\"Fail Pet\\" was coined, or at least first used in print, by Mozilla Engineer Fred Wenzel in a post on his blog entitled \\"Why Wikipedia might need a fail-pet — and why Mozilla does not.\\" Dr. Sean Rintel argues that error messages are a critical strategic moment in brand awareness and loyalty. Fail pets are of interest to marketers because they can result in brand recognition (especially through earned media). \\"However, that same recognition carries the danger of highlighting service failure.\\" The most famous fail pet is Twitter's Fail Whale (see Twitter service outages). Other fail pets include: * Ars Technica: Moon Shark * FarmVille on Facebook: Sad cow. * GitHub: Octocat * Google: Broken robot * iCloud: Cloud with Apple System 7 emoticon-style face * Macintosh: Sad Mac * Tumblr: Tumbeasts * Twitter: Fail Whale / Twitter Robot * YouTube: Televisions (on main site), light static inside video window (embedded video) * Cartoon Network: BMO [Asia]: Domo * Google Chrome: T-Rex  Message format  The form that error messages take varies between operating systems and programs. Error messages on hardware devices, like computer peripherals, may take the form of dedicated lights indicating an error condition, a brief code that needs to be interpreted using a look-up sheet or a manual, or via a more detailed message on a display. On computers, error messages may take the form of text printed to a console, or they may be presented as part of a graphical user interface. Error messages are often presented as a dialog box, which makes them cause a following mode error in the user interaction. In many cases the original error can be avoided by error prevention techniques. Instead of raising an error message the system design should have avoided the conditions that caused the error.Raskin, Jef 2000.The Humane Interface, Addison-Wesley . See chapter 6-4-2, Messages to the User While various graphical user interfaces have different conventions for displaying error messages, several techniques have become common: * A dialog box, or pop-up message, appears in a window on the screen, blocking further interaction with the computer until it is acknowledged. On Mac OS X, sheets are a form of dialog box that are attached to a specific window. * Notification icons appear to notify a user about a condition without interrupting their work. On Windows, notification icons appear in the System Tray. On Mac OS X, notification icons may appear in the menu bar, or may take the form of an application's icon \\"bouncing\\" in the Dock. The GNOME user interface for Unix systems can display notification icons in a panel. * Minor errors may be displayed in a status bar, a small portion of an application's window that can display brief messages to the user. The three main factors that influence the design of error messages are technical limitations, the amount of information to be presented, and what kind of user input is required. Some systems have technical limitations that may constrain the amount of information an error message can contain. For example, a printer with a sixteen-character alphanumeric display can only show a very limited amount of information at once, so it may need to display very terse error messages. Even with computer monitors, the programmer must consider the smallest monitor that a user might reasonably use, and ensure that any error messages will fit on that screen. The nature of the error determines the amount of information required to effectively convey the error message. A complex issue may require a more detailed error message in order to adequately inform the user of the problem. = Security = When designing error messages, software designers should take care to avoid creating security vulnerabilities. The designer should give the user enough information to make an intelligent decision, but not so much information that the user is overwhelmed or confused. Extraneous information may be hidden by default or placed in a separate location. Error message should not expose information that can be exploited by a cracker to obtain information that is otherwise difficult to obtain. Examples are systems which may show either \\"invalid user\\" or \\"invalid password\\" depending on which is incorrect, and the error page in the web server IIS 5.0 which provides a complete technical description of the error including a source code fragment.

The stadium holds 54,600 and has a retractable roof. Its special heating system allows the stadium to host comfortable events at the height of winter.  History  Aerial view of Messe Düsseldorf in District 5, including the Arena on the far left Construction of the stadium began in 2002 and was completed in 2004. It was built to replace the former Rheinstadion at the same site near the river Rhine. The structure's initial seating capacity of 51,500 was expanded in summer 2010 when some seating areas were converted into standing terraces. The arena currently hosts association football team Fortuna Düsseldorf (currently in the first division, the Bundesliga). Sports events =International football matches= While the Arena was not one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, it has hosted several international matches since it opened. The first international match in the Arena was an international friendly between Germany and Argentina on 9 February 2005, ending in a 2–2 draw. On 7 February 2007, Germany played their second international friendly in the Arena, beating Switzerland 3–1. In their third international friendly in the Arena, on 11 February 2009, Germany suffered a 1–0 defeat to Norway.

Local natives in the mid-19th century knew the river as the Upper Jordan. The Hasbani River derives most of its discharge from two springs in Lebanon,FAO (Water Resources section) \\"Overall, there are about 40 major streams in Lebanon and, based on the hydrographic system, the country can be divided into five regions: ...

Upstream from the Wazzani, the river is dry.\\" In modern history Bridge over Hasbani River 1920 The Hasbani was included in the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan, proposed in 1955 by special US envoy Eric Johnston.Cronin, Patrick M. (2008) The Evolution of Strategic Thought Routledge, p 189 Under the plan, Lebanon was allocated usage of 35 million mcm annually from it. The plan was rejected by the Arab League. Instead, at the 2nd Arab summit conference in Cairo of January 1964 the League decided that Syria, Lebanon and Jordan would begin a water diversion project. Syria started the construction of canal to divert the flow of the Banias river away from Israel and along the slopes of the Golan toward the Yarmouk River. Lebanon was to construct a canal from the Hasbani River to Banias and complete the scheme.Shlaim, Avi (200) ibid pp 229–230 In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo. The main item on the agenda was the threat posed by Israel's diversion of water from the north to irrigate the south and the expected reduction in the water supplies available to Syria and Jordan. The reaction of the summit to this threat was deadly serious. The preamble to its decision stated, :The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And Since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel. The project was to divert 20 to 30 million cubic metres of water from the river Jordan tributaries to Syria and Jordan for the development of Syria and Jordan.Political Thought and Political History: Studies in Memory of Elie Kedourie By Elie Kedourie, M. Gammer, Joseph Kostiner, Moshe Shemesh, Routledge, (2003) p 165 This led to military intervention from Israel, first with tank and artillery fire and then, as the Syrians shifted the works further eastward, with airstrikes.

Title The title is taken from a well-known rabbinical saying attributed to Hillel the Elder: \\"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And when I am for myself, what am 'I'? And if not now, when?\\" (see also Pirkei Avot). Plot The story follows a number of Jewish partisans and resistance fighters as they struggle to survive and sabotage the German war machine behind Nazi lines during World War II, starting in the western Soviet Union (Byelorossiya) and ending in Milan. The book's chief protagonist, Mendel Nachmanovich Dajcher, worked as a watch repairer before joining the Red Army, where he fought in the artillery. While he is at war, his wife and shtetl are massacred by a German Einsatzgruppe. In the midst of battle, he loses his regiment, becomes disoriented and is overtaken by the front, separated from and unsupported by Soviet forces. His life thereafter is an odyssey through the \\"partisanka\\", the motley partisan movement, which includes Russians, Jews, Lithuanians and Poles. About halfway through the book, Mendel and his companion from the first chapter, Leonid, fall in with a group of Jewish resistance fighters called the gedalistas, after their leader: Gedale. With them, Mendel traverses Poland and, overtaken by the victorious Soviets, enters defeated Germany. From there, the group aims for Italy, dreaming of making the aliyah to Palestine to take part in the Zionist project of reclaiming a Jewish homeland. Reception If Not Now, When? won the Campiello and Viareggio prizes the year of its publication. The critic Adam Kirsch rates Levi's Holocaust writing including If Not Now, When? as his primary literary contribution, but doesn't see the book as one of Levi's classics, like If This Is a Man, The Drowned and the Saved and The Periodic Table. He disagrees with the assessment of Ann Goldstein that \\"the label Holocaust writer does him a regrettable injustice\\". Kirsch's assessment is that Levi \\"had no real gift for inventing plot and character—a lack that comes across most clearly in his one real novel, If Not Now, When. Where he excelled was recording and reflecting on his own experience; and inevitably the experience that engrossed his imagination was Auschwitz.\\" Background In his nonfiction, Levi described himself as a largely ineffectual partisan. He joined a group of inexperienced resistance fighters near Turin, was captured shortly thereafter, and soon sent to Auschwitz.

It was the home ground for Coventry City F.C. for 106 years. History It was built in 1899 in the Hillfields district, close to the city centre, and staged its final game on 30 April 2005 when Coventry City beat Derby County 6-2 in the Football League Championship with the last ever goal appropriately being scored by Andy Whing, a product of Coventry City's youth academy. A concert by pop star Elton John was held at the stadium afterwards. The club then moved to the Ricoh Arena, at Foleshill in the north of the city. Highfield Road had one of the largest playing surfaces in the English leagues and was the English league's first all-seater stadium (the first all-seater in the UK was Clydebank's Kilbowie Park. The all-seater policy introduced by Jimmy Hill was later abandoned when Leeds United fans tore-out several hundred seats after losing their First Division game to Coventry City 4-0 in 1981, only months after the seats had been installed. Standing accommodation returned to Highfield Road in 1983, but it became all- seater once again 11 years later when all top division clubs were required to have all-seater stadiums as a result of the Taylor Report which was the sequel to the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. The stadium's record attendance was 51,455 when Coventry City played their West Midlands rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in a Football League Division 2 game in 1967. However, after it was converted to an all-seater stadium for the second time in the mid-1990s, its maximum capacity was 23,489 at the time of its closure, and all of the pre-1990 seats had been replaced in 1995. The stadium had by then been well- developed with one corner filled to provide a more modern look and feel. However, it lacked facilities compared to the new stadia of similar-sized clubs, which was one of the main causes of the move to the Ricoh Arena. Another reason for relocation was that parking facilities in the local area were inadequate. When the stadium was first given the go-ahead in 1999, it had been planned to build a 45,000-seat stadium as part of England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup. However, England's failure to win the bid to host the tournament - combined with Coventry's relegation in 2001 - saw the stadium's capacity scaled down. Demolition work began in February 2006 and was completed by the end of the following month. Post-stadium housing development The site of the stadium was regenerated by George Wimpey plc to provide housing on the areas which were originally the car parks and stands. The area which was the playing surface was relaid with grass so that the local children can continue the tradition of playing football on that space.

The current member lineup consists of Gara on vocals, Yuu and Kenichi on guitar, Tetsu on bass, and Nero on the drums. History =2000~2004= In late 2000, after the disbandment of their bands After effect and Shiver respectively, vocalist Gara and guitarist Yuu, only briefly acquainted through a few live events, contacted each other in hopes of a fresh beginning. In the following months of 2001, a series of meetings and discussions over the phone eventually led to the recruitment of the three other members, Tetsu, Nero and Kenichi in that order, and the five of them formed in October 2001 what was to be known as Merry today. Early activities as an obscure indies band included the distribution of 500 copies of a 2-track MD in indie CD stores nationwide, accompanied by a number of secret live shows held in Tokyo and Nagoya. Regular \\"serious\\" activities only began in 2002. Following more live shows, the band created their own independent label Gekiyaku records and released their first maxi-single titled \\"Haikarasan ga tooru\\" in February. There were three versions of this single – gold, silver and bronze – each one limited to 1000 copies. Gold and bronze versions were only available through mail order through the rock magazine Fool's Mate, while the silver version was available in stores. All were sold out at pre-order. In March, the band had their first one-man live at Meguro Rockmaykan. A second press of Haikarasan ga tooru, which included a new song \\"Tokyo Telephone\\", was then later released in May. In mid to late 2002, a pair of maxi-singles were released, \\"Koseiha Blend ~Tasogare-hen~\\" and \\"Koseiha Blend ~Junjou Jounetsu-hen~\\", containing three new tracks each and packaged in LP-sized sleeves illustrated by infamous EroGuro comic artist Suehiro Maruo. Both were limited to 3000 copies and were once again sold out at pre-order. The band also contributed to two omnibus compilations. These releases were accompanied by numerous live events. In March 2003 the band released their first full album Gendai Stoic on Kiyoharu's (leader and singer of Kuroyume and Sads) Fullface records, selling over 10,000 copies on the day of its release. In June Merry opened for Sadd at Zepp Tokyo, and in August released a third press of \\"Haikarasan ga Tooru\\" entitled \\"Haikarasan ga Toorisugita Ato...\\", which contained re-recordings of the original songs and a secret track. In the same month the band were working on their first promotional video (PV) of \\"Violet Harenchi\\", which was then released on a DVD limited to the one-man live at Shibuya Koukaidou on 29 August. The closing months of 2003 saw a live tour and the band's participation in \\"Beautifool's Fest '03\\", a live event organized by Fool's Mate. 2004 began with the release of a pair of maxi-singles in February before the band went into a brief hiatus, working on their second full album. Modern Garde was finally released on 30 June, accompanied by a live tour \\"New Standard Renaissance.\\" In September Merry participated in a large-scale event, \\"Kingdom Rock Show 2004\\", held at the Nippon Budokan, performing beside major bands like Psycho le Cemu, Janne Da Arc and Sex Machineguns. =2005~2008= March 2005 saw the release of \\"Sakashima End Roll ~The Phantom of the Gallery~\\", a brand new maxi-single and DVD on reverse sides of single disc – it was to be one of Japan's first titles on the new DualDisc formAt. First press was sold out at pre-order, and the release itself quickly made it to the 2nd spot on the Oricon indies chart. The sold-out and highly successful one- man live at Shibuya Koukaidou on 31 March saw the long-awaited announcement of the band's major contract with JVC's Victor Entertainment – home to artists such as Buck-Tick, Boøwy, Cali≠Gari, The Back Horn and Love Psychedelico – much to the tearful elation of loyal fans. It is also worth noting that the record company was the one to offer a proposal to the band first and not the reverse. The transition to a major label prompted the release of a best-of album – Koseiha Blend Classic ~Oldies Tracks~ – which contained re-recorded and remastered tracks off the older releases, together with two new songs; first press came with a new PV of \\"Tick-tock\\" and second press with the rare \\"Violet Harenchi\\" video previously released only at a live show. Fool's Mate published a pair of history books documenting the band's appearances in the magazine, coupled with long interviews and a special CD and DVD. From July to August, Merry set out on their \\"Last Indies Tour\\", which finally culminated at the Hibiya outdoors music hall on 10 September – their first major one-man show. The band's major debut album, Nu Chemical Rhetoric, made it to the 10th spot on the Oricon daily album chart a day before its official release. Concert footage of the Hibiya live was later released on a DVD entitled Sci-fi Nu Chemical Rhetoric ~First Cut~, which similarly made it to the top of the charts. A pair of DVDs documenting the \\"Last Indies Tour\\" were released at the beginning of 2006. Nu Chemical Rhetoric was then released all over Europe, specifically Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Scandinavia and Italy. In the meantime, Merry filmed two promotional videos while working on their upcoming album; the first major single \\"Sayonara Rain\\" successfully made it to the 24th spot on the Oricon weekly top 30 singles chart (5 June) while the second one titled \\"Ringo to Uso\\", released a month later, was No. 25\\\\. Merry once again played at the Hibiya outdoors music hall on 30 July, following the release of their 2nd major album Peep Show on 19 July – footage of the concert will be released on DVD on 20 December. A nationwide one-man tour then took place in August and September. In late October, the band filmed the video for upcoming single \\"Calling\\" at Izu Ōshima, enduring stormy weather. At the same time Peep Show had a European release. At the start of December, Merry traveled to Europe to perform overseas for the first time in Munich and Paris on 1 and 3 December respectively. Their third major single \\"Calling\\" was released on 6 December and featured collaborations with Balzac and The Mad Capsule Markets's Takeshi Ueda. As a closing to 2006 and in commemoration of the band's 5th anniversary, a special countdown live was held at the Shibuya Koukaidou on New Year's Eve. In February 2007, Merry went on a joint tour with Balzac. Their 4th major single \\"Blind Romance/Saihate no Parade\\" was then released on 18 April. Promotional videos were filmed for both songs and \\"Saihate no Parade\\" was used as the ending theme for the Over Drive anime. In May, Merry went on the brief \\"Oriental Circus\\" tour, playing in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. On 26 May, Merry performed at the J-Rock Revolution Festival held in Los Angeles, America, alongside artists such as Mucc, Girugamesh and D'espairsRay. Another tour went through the late summer of 2007. =2009~Present= MERRY released the single \\"Identity\\" on 7 November 2009. The release marked the band's return to an independent label. Merry have participated on two tribute albums which are scheduled for release on 10 November & 1 December 2010. The first being Pierrot to Suika to Yayauke Rider Subete wa World Peace no Tame ni – Saikyo Senshi-tachi ga Koko ni Shuketsu - which is a tribute to Atsushi Inoue, vocalist of punk rock band New Rote'ka. The second is Romantist – The Stalin, Michiro Endo Tribute Album - which is a tribute album celebrating the 60th birthday of The Stalin front man, Michiro Endo. Many prominent artists pay their tributes to the founder & front man of the influential 80s punk band, including Buck-Tick, Group Tamashii, Dir en grey, Jun Togawa, Wagdug Futuristic Unity, Yuki etc. Merry covered Dir en grey's song \\"Schwein no Isu\\" for the compilation Crush! -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-, the album was released on 26 January 2011 and features current visual kei bands covering songs from bands that were important to the '90s visual kei movement. Their 7th album \\"Beautiful Freaks\\" was released on 27 July 2011. They covered Buck-Tick's \\"Aku no Hana\\" for Parade II -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick-, released on 4 July 2012. The band went on hiatus in February 2013 due to vocalist Gara's need for hernia treatment. The band resumed activities in August. However, in October bassist Tetsu was involved in an onstage accident with a stage diver that resulted in him receiving a severe neck injury. Tetsu would spend the next two and a half years out of the eyes of the public, focusing on rehabilitation. Initially the band performed with supporting bassists, but eventually settled on playing along to Tetsu's bass lines from the studio recordings. On 24 December 2014, MERRY released its new studio-album titled \\"NOnsenSe MARkeT\\". For the first time in the band's history, frontman Gara wrote all the lyrics before writing the music, as he confessed in an interview for VerdamMnis Magazine. As the name of the album suggests, the concept of the album is based on the criticism of Japan and more generally modern societies. Singer Gara discusses Japan's politics and societal issues with French reporter Mandah Frenot in an in-depth interview for VerdamMnis Magazine. On 2 January 2015, MERRY performed at Shibuya Kokaido, where during the double encore Tetsu made his first stage appearance since his accident. He joined the band for the song \\"Gunjou\\", playing whilst having his bass on a stand (as opposed to a strap) and wore a neck brace. This marked the beginning of Tetsu's gradual return to the band full-time. Throughout the year Tetsu would join the band for encores, graudally increasing the number of songs he performed with them. In November 2015, the band launched \\"Lamb Fest\\", a two-day festival hosted by MERRY. As VerdamMnis Magazine stated in live report article, \\"the two-day festival was an opportunity for the Japanese quintet to celebrate its 14th anniversary\\". On 7 February 2016, MERRY performed the final show of their tour in support of \\"NOnsenSe MARkeT\\". The show marked Tetsu's return as full-time bassist, albeit still using a stand and neck brace. On 27 January 2017, MERRY released a new single titled \\"Heijitsu no Onna\\". On 5 May, the band performed at the Hibiya Yagai Ongakudo. During the encore, Tetsu performed without a neck brace or stand. Since this, Tetsu has begun to occasionally perform encores in the same way. They released a new studio album titled \\"M-ology\\" on 6 September. They also covered \\"So...\\" by D'erlanger for the D'erlanger Tribute Album ~Stairway to Heaven~. Beginning on 3 September, MERRY commenced their 47-prefecture tour in support of \\"M-ology\\" titled \\"System M-ology\\". They also covered \\"Ieji\\" by MUCC for their tribute album.

Though some may not find this entirely appealing, the result is undeniably \\"totally fresh\\", as former Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman put it. Like many others, the members themselves were influenced by Japanese pioneer rock bands of the 80s and early 90s such as Buck-Tick, D'erlanger, Luna Sea, Kuroyume, The Blue Hearts and Boøwy. The main songwriters are the two guitarists Yuu and Kenichi, the former writing majority of the slower, groovier songs and the latter composing faster, catchier melodies. Not afraid to experiment with their musical ability, Merry delivers a full spectrum of brand new tunes with the release of every anticipated album. The band's music and lyrical imagery are likely influenced by the liberal Taisho and early Shōwa era, a period of significant artistic and musical movement when Japan shifted further towards Western concepts. It was the time of avant-garde; industrialisation saw the introduction of jazz and blues to Japanese culture, bringing about the rise of music cafes, bars and clubs. Similarly Merry fuse these genres with modern rock music to create a whole new style – a \\"modern avant-garde\\", or rather \\"modern-garde\\" as their second album is named. Lyrics-wise, vocalist Gara writes on a broad variety of topics, ranging from themes of war & patriotism (Rest in peace, Japanese modernist, 愛国行進曲 \\"Patriot march\\"), politics & society (迷彩ノ紳士 \\"Gentlemen in disguise\\", ニセモノ天国 \\"Fake heaven\\", Lost generation) to those of dreams, life, love and hate (窓 \\"Window\\", 恋愛交差点 \\"Intersection of love\\"). Some of these carry a retro feel in their imagery (黄昏レストラン \\"Sunset restaurant\\", 薔薇と片隅のブルース \\"Blues of the rose and corner\\", 東京テレホン \\"Tokyo telephone\\" and R-246), once again attributed to the influence of Taisho era romanticism. In-depth information =External relationships= Merry is most notably connected to the popular Dir en grey – the band's name never fails to appear in the \\"very special thanks\\" credits in every release. Before forming his own band, Gara was a roadie for Dir en grey, forming a close bond with vocalist Kyo, whom he still considers his senior and mentor. Gara is also known to hold a lot of respect for Kiyoharu (solo artist and vocalist for Sads and Kuroyume) Horror punk band Balzac has also been very supportive of Merry. In 2006 the two bands combined efforts in a reconstruction of one of Merry's songs \\"Hi no Ataranai Basho\\". They have also previously performed together at several live events. Merry are also closely related to Mucc, Kagerou and Craze, the members being good friends with each other. =Super Merries= スーパーメリーズ (Suupaa Meriizu) Super Merries is the alter-ego band of Merry. The members all dress differently and play under the following stagenames: *Gara – *Yuu – *Kenichi – *Tetsu – *Nero – Very little is known about them as they have only appeared in a few live shows and a special feature in Fool's Mate. They seem to be currently defunct, though there's no telling when they may spring up again.

Biography  Son of Alfred Meidner and Elise Bandmann, Meidner was born on 23 June 1914 in Breslau, Silesia. He was forced to flee Nazi Germany after the Reichstag fire in Berlin 1933, being Jewish and a socialist. In 1937, Meidner married Ella Jörgenssen and became a citizen of Sweden in 1943.In Memory of Rudolf Meidner (1914-2005) Meidner was an economist and the developer of the employee funds plan proposed by the Swedish Trade Union Confederation in the 1970s. He studied under famous economist and Nobel Prize Winner Gunnar Myrdal. He got his PhD in 1954 with a dissertation labeled \\"Swedish Labour Market at Full Employment\\". He spent most of his work life at the Swedish Trade Union Confederation as a researcher. Meidner died on 9 December 2005 in Lidingö, aged 91.  Rehn-Meidner model  Meidner and Swedish economist Gösta Rehn were responsible for the Rehn–Meidner model for economic growth as promulgated by the Swedish Social Democratic Party and the LO. the blue-collar trade union. The Rehn–Meidner model was first proposed in 1951 and for over the next twenty-five years was the basis for the low- inequality, high-tech oriented, rapid-innovation Swedish economy which also was exposed to international trade and became export oriented. In response to the increasing demand on the part of workers, communities and women for a share of the excess profits (permitted by a capital-labor-state wage suppression agreement) accumulated in an increasingly powerful capitalist sector, Meidner created a proposal in 1976, published by the LO, that called for requiring all companies above a certain size to issue new stock shares to workers so that within twenty years the workers would control 52% of the companies they worked in. This policy followed in Meidner's career-long efforts to build a step-wise, peaceful, institutionally supported transition to a socialist society, whose carefully crafted incentive structure and culture would allow each member of society to work and contribute according to her or his capacity and receive social support according to her or his needs.Olsen, Gregg. The Struggle for Economic Democracy in Sweden. Supported by important Swedish policy designer Walter Korpi, Meidner's work was opposed by pro-capitalist Social Democrats, including the aggressively conservative Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt as well as Gosta Rehn (proponent of active labour market policies) and Olof Palme. The increasing ambitions and occasional militancy of the Swedish working class in conjunction with Meidner's careful, progressive socialist institutional planning politicized the Swedish capitalist class via the Swedish Employers Association (SAF), who joined other countries' capitalist classes ramping up their political efforts to destroy working class organizational bases and to promote the capital deregulation and mobility that began to come to crisis in the 2000s.Vogel. Fluctuating Fortunes. The SAF's response was to model their political and policy strategies after the New Zealand capitalist class' campaign which had successfully destroyed a labor movement of similar strength to the Swedish labor movement. The Rehn–Meidner model resulted in Sweden having a very egalitarian wage system so that wage differentials between professions was very low, fortifying a low Gini coefficient. However, in the absence of the socialist steps urged by Meidner in the 1970s the economic model resulted in capital concentration (despite a very active social policy, Sweden has one of the highest percentages of private ownership of capital in the world) to the point where in the late 1970s 25% of share capital was held by the top 0.1% of shareholders and 75% by the top 10%. For the time being, the progressive taxation and pro-middle class state institutions promoted by the model extensively ameliorate this capital concentration as can be seen in comparatively successful, egalitarian outcomes.Schmitt, John and Ben Zipperer. 2006. \\"Is the U.S. a Good Model for Reducing Social Exclusion in Europe?\\" The Post-autistic Economics Review, 40 (1).

Fantasoft released a Microsoft Windows-compatible version in 1999, and a science fiction role-playing game based on the Realmz engine, titled New Centurions, in 2001. Realmz was originally written by Tim Phillips on a Macintosh IIsi; he also wrote four game scenarios, including the introductory scenario \\"City of Bywater\\". Other original scenario contributors were Jim Foley (who wrote two scenarios, namely \\"Castle in the Clouds\\" and \\"White Dragon\\") and Sean Sayrs (who wrote three, including \\"Prelude to Pestilence\\" and \\"Griloch's Revenge\\"). Realmz is similar to the Exile series by Spiderweb Software which features similar gameplay and graphics, and both were originally published by Fantasoft. Custom Realmz game scenarios can be created with a tool called Divinity - also produced by Fantasoft, LLC. A special version of Realmz - Divine Right - is useful in conjunction with Divinity. It is the debugger software for user-created scenarios.  Setting  While Realmz is primarily an engine for playing a number of scenarios (roughly corresponding to the campaigns in a tabletop RPG) using the same characters and set of rules, the different scenarios tend to take place in a broadly similar high fantasy setting known as \\"The Realmz\\". In fact, Fantasoft was once contacted by TSR about similarities to the Forgotten Realms D&D; module, forcing the alteration of a number of elements in Realmz and its scenarios.  Gameplay  Realmz game-play screenshot. Realmz game-play screenshot. Realmz is a Role-playing video game where the player assumes the roles of a party of heroes in fictional adventures. The turn-based, tile-based game has rules for individual combat and the use of magic spells in fighting while focusing on the medieval- period high fantasy genre. The user interface consists of a character status bar which includes the character portrait, combat status, the character name, current stamina/maximum stamina, attacks/round or spell points/max spell points and the characters armor rating. Players can select from a range of different actions including camping, inventory management, spellcasting, displaying current spells affecting the party, using spells from a scrollcase, trading items between characters, exchanging money between characters, resting, and inscribing spells to scrolls. The action panel also displays the current time and day in-game and the current source of light. Special actions include area search, entering a temple, shopping and attempting to perform a special action. Combat gameplay involves the basic movement of characters around the combat screen which costs movement points. The amount of movement points are affected by how much weight the character is carrying. Each character has a maximum movement allowance that is determined by their statistics. A character will always have at least 2 movement points per round, even if that character is carrying the maximum load. Rougher terrain takes longer to cross and can affect combat gameplay. Open areas cost 1 movement point to cross while obstacles and muddy or rocky areas cost more movement points. Some objects, such as trees or giant fungi, are solid barriers to small creatures, while larger creatures are able to step over or move through these objects. Characters can also swap positions with other characters (since version 5), or they can attack a friend. Characters on auto mode or those that are reanimated will never attack an ally and will always try to swap positions. Magic-using characters use spell points to cast spells, regenerating spell points slowly over time or more rapidly while resting. Spells are gained only at level-up by \\"purchasing\\" them using spell selection points, which the character receives a set number of based on their stats (although priestly classes instead gained entire levels of spells at a time with every three level-ups in earlier versions of Realmz). When encamped, the party's magic users can store away pre-cast spells for the future by using parchment, a scroll case, and an additional spell point penalty to create scrolls; these scrolls could then be used in the future (even by compatible proto-magical classes like thieves and paladins) without spending spell points. One unusual feature of the Realmz' magic system is that most spells could have their power (damage, area, targets, duration, etc.) scaled by two to seven times in return for increased cost.  Scenarios  Divinity scenario development kit screenshot. While new scenarios were released throughout the game's history, also typically packed along with the game in the next Realmz release, the game ultimately ended up with 13 official scenarios: *City Of Bywater (developed alongside Realmz by Tim Phillips) *Prelude To Pestilence (1995, Sean Sayrs) *Assault On Giant Mountain (1995, Tim Phillips) *Castle in The Clouds (1995, Jim Foley) *Destroy The Necronomicon (1995, Tim Phillips) *White Dragon (1996, Jim Foley) *Grilochs Revenge (1997, Sean Sayrs) *Twin Sands of Time (1999, Sean Sayrs) *Trouble in the Sword Lands (1999, Pierre H. Vachon) *Mithril Vault (1999, Tim Phillips) *Half Truth (2000, Nicholas T. Tyacke) *War in the Sword Lands (2000, Pierre H. Vachon) *Wrath of the Mind Lords (2002, Pierre H. Vachon) Many third party scenarios have been developed by fans and game developers by using Divinity, a scenario development kit (SDK) for Realmz that was released years into the lifespan of Realmz. This allowed players who have no knowledge of programming to create scenarios with their own monsters, items, graphics and storyline.  Character editor  Realmz Character Editor screenshot. A character editor program was created and could be purchased separately from Realmz. The editor enables players to change existing characters and generate new characters with their own skills, portraits and other settings such as strength. However, not every aspect of a character can be edited. The fact sheet for characters are displayed on the screen, and is similar to the fact sheet in the Realmz game. An edit bar at the top of the screen allow players to edit a character's spells, conditions, and abilities. Characters can be given any items, however they are still subject to the restrictions of that item; as an example a Priest is still only be able to use blunt weapons.  Future of Realmz  Tim Phillips is no longer developing Realmz, and the game has not been updated in several years. It can only be run natively under the classic Mac OS from System 7 to Mac OS 9 or Windows 98, Windows XP and Windows 7. Bugs on the Windows version exist, and it is not up to version parity with the final Macintosh release. Users have been able to run Realmz through the Classic environment, or using emulation software such as Basilisk II or SheepShaver.  Free Realmz  Realmz was originally released as shareware, with a $20 registration fee and additional fees for each scenario. As of November 2008, Fantasoft has released the full version of Realmz as a free download. The registration numbers for the scenarios have been made available to everyone on the Realmz Yahoo Group. Those who run Mac OS Classic were instructed to enter 410 on the registration screen and type in the serial number 13706024 then use the serial and registration code from Fantasoft. Whereas windows users could enter 410 on the registration screen and type in the serial number 13706024 then use the serial and registration code from Fantasoft.  Reviews  Realmz received positive reviews from magazines and websites in the Macintosh community shortly after its initial release. Some of the more notable reviews are from MacUser, MacCentral and cnet. Many users were pleased with the game's good customer support, \\"intuitive user interface\\" and the continuous release of improved versions. Realmz game was voted \\"Best Shareware Game\\" by MacUser magazine in 1995 and awarded the Golden Mouse for best shareware adventure game in the Swedish edition of MacWorld.

It was founded around the Manifesto of the Fourth Communist International, published by the Communist Workers' Party of Germany (KAPD) in 1921. History The organisation was founded in 1922, following a split in the KAPD, by members of the Essen Faction, including Herman Gorter and Karl Schröder, the Berlin Faction holding that the formation of an international was premature. It was joined by the Communist Workers' Party of the Netherlands, Sylvia Pankhurst's Communist Workers' Party in Britain, the Left Communists in Russia (who accordingly renamed themselves the Communist Workers' Party), the Communist Workers' Group in Russia and some left communists in Belgium and Bulgaria. The International was never able to organise joint activities and probably never reached 1,000 members. It was weakened by the dissolution of some of its members groups, and the departure of the Russian Communist Workers' Group, who disagreed with its opposition to a united front with the Third International. The KAPD's Essen Tendency dissolved in 1927, and the leadership of the International was passed to the Netherlands, as the Dutch group was the only party still holding membership, the other constituents being isolated individuals. It still nominally existed at the start of the 1930s, but undertook no international activity, only publishing work in the name of the organisation.Philippe Bourrinet, The Dutch and German Communist Left (1900-1968)  References  External links * Richard Gombin, The Radical Tradition: Council Communism *Herman Gorter, The World Revolution *Commentary on Herman Gorter's Open Letter to Comrade Lenin *Ian Hebbes, The Communist Left in Russia after 1920 Category:Council communism Category:Left communist internationals Category:Organizations established in 1921 ","title":"Communist Workers' International"},{"id":"3388629","text":"Carl Cooper (born 1960) is a former Anglican bishop who was the Bishop of St. David's from 2002 to 2008.

Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed June 7 2019. It is the most commonly used method of ranking teams with equal points in limited overs league competitions, similar to goal difference in football. The NRR in a single game is the average runs per over that team scores, minus the average runs per over that is scored against them. The NRR in a tournament is the average runs per over that a team scores across the whole tournament, minus the average runs per over that is scored against them across the whole tournament. This is the same as the weighted average of the run rates scored in each match (weighted by the lengths of the innings batted compared to the other innings batted), minus the weighted average of the run rates conceded in each match (weighted by the lengths of the innings bowled compared to the other innings bowled). This is not usually the same as the total or average of the NRRs from the individual matches in the tournament. A positive NRR means a team is scoring faster than its opposition overall, while a negative NRR means a team is scoring slower than the teams it has come up against. It is therefore desirable for the NRR to be as high as possible. NRR has been criticised as hard to understand. Also, while it measures how quickly teams score and concede runs, this is not at all the same as how big the teams' margins of victory or defeat are (as it ignores wickets lost), and so ranking sides by NRR does not rank them by size of victory. This means a team which progresses in a tournament at the expense of another team, due to a higher NRR, may not have truly performed better than their opponents. Step by step explanation A team's run rate (RR), or runs per over (RPO), is the average number of runs scored per over by the whole team in the whole innings (or the whole innings so far), i.e. \\\\text{run rate }=\\\\frac{\\\\text{total runs scored}}{\\\\text{total overs faced}}. So if a team scores 250 runs off 50 overs then their RR is \\\\frac{250}{50} = 5. Note that as an over is made up of six balls, each ball is 1/6 of an over, despite being normally written in cricket's notation as .1 of an over. So if they got that same score off 47.5 overs, their RR would be \\\\frac{250}{47\\\\frac{5}{6}} = 5.23. The concept of net run rate involves subtracting the opponents' run rate from the team's run rate, i.e. \\\\text{match net run rate }=\\\\frac{\\\\text{total runs scored}}{\\\\text{total overs faced}}-\\\\frac{\\\\text{total runs conceded }}{\\\\text{total overs bowled}} . For two teams which have just played, the winning side will have a positive Match NRR, and the losing side will have the negative of this (i.e. the Match NRRs will be additive inverses, summing to zero). A single match's NRR is used very rarely, perhaps only after a team has played one match in a tournament, so their tournament NRR is the same as the match NRR. Usually, runs and overs are summed together throughout a season to compare teams in a league table. A team's overall NRR for a tournament is not defined as the sum or average of the NRR's from the individual matches, but as: \\\\text{tournament net run rate }=\\\\frac{\\\\text{total runs scored in all matches}}{\\\\text{total overs faced in all matches}} - \\\\frac{\\\\text{total runs conceded in all matches}}{\\\\text{total overs bowled in all matches}} The exceptions to this are: *If a team is bowled out, the calculations don't use the number of overs actually bowled, but the full quota of overs to which the team was entitled (e.g. 50 overs for a One Day International, and 20 overs for a Twenty20 match). *If a match is interrupted, Duckworth-Lewis revised targets are set, and a result is subsequently achieved, the revised targets and revised overs are used for Team 1's innings (i.e. 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2, off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2), and the actual runs scored and overs used by Team 2 are used for Team 2's innings (as normal). *If a match is abandoned as a No Result, none of the runs scored or overs bowled count towards this calculation. *If a match is abandoned but a result decided by retrospectively applying Duckworth-Lewis, the number of overs assigned to each team for this calculation is the number of overs actually faced by Team 2. Team 1 is credited with Team 2's Par Score (the number of runs they would need to have reached from this number of overs and wickets lost if they were going to match Team 1's score), and the actual runs scored are used by Team 2 for Team 2's innings. Scenarios All scenarios assume One Day International rules with 50 overs per side. =1. Side that bats first wins= * Team A bat first and score 287–6 off their full quota of 50 overs. Team A's Run Rate is \\\\frac{287}{50} = 5.74. * Team B fail in their run chase, scoring 243–8 in their 50 overs. Team B's Run Rate is \\\\frac{243}{50} = 4.86. * Team A's NRR for this game is 5.74 − 4.86 = 0.88. If this was the first game of the season, their NRR for the league table would be +0.88. * Team B's NRR for this game is 4.86 − 5.74 = −0.88. If this was the first game of the season, their NRR for the league table would be −0.88. =2. Side that bats second wins= * Team A bat first and score 265–8 off their full quota of 50 overs. Team A's Run Rate is \\\\frac{265}{50} = 5.30. * Team B successfully chase, getting their winning runs with a four with 2.4 of the 50 overs remaining, leaving them on 267–5. Team B faced 47.2 overs, so their Run Rate is \\\\frac{267}{47\\\\frac{2}{6}} = 5.64. * Assuming that Team A and Team B had previously played as in the game in scenario one, the new tournament NRR for Team A would be: \\\\frac{287+265}{50+ 50}-\\\\frac{243+267}{50+47\\\\frac{2}{6}} = \\\\frac{552}{100}-\\\\frac{510}{97\\\\frac{2}{6}} = 5.52 - 5.24 = 0.28. =3. Side that bats first is bowled out, side batting second wins= * Team A bat first and are bowled out for 127 off 25.4 overs. Despite their run rate for the balls they faced being 127 / 25.667 = 4.95, because they were bowled out the entire 50 overs are added to their total overs faced tally for the tournament, and Team B are credited with having bowled 50 overs. * Team B reach the target off 30.5 overs, ending with 128–4. Team B actually scored at a slower pace (128/30.833 = 4.15), however they managed to protect their wickets and win. Thus, only the 30.833 overs are added to the seasonal tally. * Team A's NRR for this game is \\\\frac{127}{50}-\\\\frac{128}{30\\\\frac{5}{6}} = -1.61. * Team B's NRR for this game is \\\\frac{128}{30\\\\frac{5}{6}}-\\\\frac{127}{50} = +1.61. * If 25.667 had been used for Team A's overs total rather than 50, Team A would have finished the match with a positive match NRR, and improved tournament NRR, despite losing. (Similarly Team B with a worsened NRR, despite winning.) =4. Side that bats second is bowled out, side batting first therefore wins= * Team A bat first and set a formidable 295–5 off their complement of 50 overs. Therefore, for the tournament NRR calculations, 295 runs and 50 overs are added to Team A's runs scored/overs faced tally and Team B's runs conceded/overs bowled tally. * Team B never get close, being bowled out for 116 off 35.4 overs. Therefore, as they were bowled out, 116 runs and 50 overs are added to Team A's runs conceded/overs bowled tally and Team B's runs scored/overs faced tally. =5. Both sides are bowled out, side batting first therefore wins= * Team A bat first, and manage 117 off 24 overs on a difficult playing surface. Team B fall agonizingly short, reaching 112 off 23.3 overs. * In this case, both teams get 50 overs both faced and bowled in the overs column for the season, just as in example 1. =6. The game ends in a tie= * Runs and overs are added as in the examples above, with teams bowled out being credited with their full quota of overs. Thus, the match NRR will always be zero for both teams. =7. Interrupted game with revised D/L target= * In matches where Duckworth-Lewis revised targets are set due to interruptions which reduce the number of overs bowled, those revised targets and revised overs are used to calculate the NRR for both teams. * For example, Team A are dismissed for 165 in 33.5 overs. Team B progresses to 120–0, but play is halted after 18 overs due to rain. * Six overs are lost, and the target is reset to 150, which Team B reach comfortably after 26.2 overs. * Because the target was revised to 150 runs from 44 overs, Team A's total is reset to 149 from 44 overs, thus their RR = \\\\frac{149}{44} \\\\approx 3.39. Team B's RR, however, is computed as normal: \\\\frac{150}{26.33} \\\\approx 5.70. * Computing the match NRR for Team A gives us 3.39 – 5.70 = –2.31. Team B's NRR is: 5.70 – 3.39 = +2.31. =8. Abandoned game recorded as No Result= * Abandoned games are not considered, whatever the stage of the game at stoppage may be, and the scores in such games are immaterial to NRR calculations. =9. Abandoned game with retrospective D/L result= *Team A score 254 runs from their 50 overs. Team B have scored 172–4 from 30 overs when the match is abandoned. *According to Duckworth-Lewis, 6 wickets and 20 overs in hand equates to 44.6% of resources, so Team B has used 55.4% of its resources, so their Par Score is 254 x 55.4% = 140.716 runs. As they are ahead of this, they are declared the winner. *Team A's RR =\\\\frac{\\\\text{Par Score for Team B}}{\\\\text{Overs faced by Team B}} = \\\\frac{140}{30} \\\\approx 4.67. *Team B's RR =\\\\frac{\\\\text{Runs scored by Team B}}{\\\\text{Overs faced by Team B}} = \\\\frac{172}{30} \\\\approx 5.73. Net Run Rate within a tournament =Basic example= Most of the time, in limited overs cricket tournaments, there are round-robin groups among several teams, where each team plays all of the others. Just as explained in the scenarios above, the NRR is not the average of the NRRs of all the matches played, it is calculated considering the overall rate at which runs are scored for and against, within the whole group. Let's take as an example South Africa's net run rate in the 1999 World Cup. FOR South Africa scored: *Against India, 254 runs (for 6 wkts) from 47.2 overs. *Against Sri Lanka, 199 runs (for 9 wkts) from 50 overs. *Against England, 225 runs (for 7 wkts) from 50 overs. *Against Kenya, 153 runs (for 3 wkts) from 41 overs. *Against Zimbabwe, 185 runs (all out) from 47.2 overs. In the case of Zimbabwe, because South Africa were all out before their allotted 50 overs expired, the run rate is calculated as if they had scored their runs over the full 50 overs. Therefore, across the five games, South Africa scored 1016 runs in a total of 238 overs and 2 balls (i.e. 238.333 overs), an average run rate of 1016/238.333 = 4.263. AGAINST Teams opposing South Africa scored: *India, 253 (for 5 wkts) from 50 overs. *Sri Lanka, 110 (all out) from 35.2 overs. *England, 103 (all out) from 41 overs. *Kenya, 152 (all out) from 44.3 overs. *Zimbabwe, 233 (for 6 wkts) from 50 overs. Again, with Sri Lanka, England and Kenya counting as the full 50 overs as they were all out, the run rate scored against South Africa across the five games is calculated on the basis of 851 runs in a total of 250 overs, an average run rate of 851/250 = 3.404. NET RUN RATE South Africa's final tournament NRR is therefore 4.263 − 3.404 = +0.859. =Change in NRR through a tournament= After match one In the above example of South Africa at the 1999 World Cup, after their first match their tournament NRR was \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{254}}{\\\\mbox{47.33}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{253}}{\\\\mbox{50}}. As Run Rate = Runs scored/Overs faced, the runs scored by and against South Africa in each innings can be replaced in this formula by Run Rate x Overs faced. They scored 254 runs from 47.33 overs, a rate of 5.37 runs per over. Therefore, the total of 254 runs can be replaced by 5.37 runs per over x 47.33 overs. Similarly, the total of 253 runs conceded can be replaced by 5.06 runs per over x 50 overs: \\\\left(5.37\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{47.33}}{\\\\mbox{47.33}}\\\\right) - \\\\left(5.06\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{50}}{\\\\mbox{50}}\\\\right) = \\\\left(5.37\\\\times 100\\\\%\\\\right)-\\\\left(5.06\\\\times 100\\\\%\\\\right). After match two After their second match, tournament NRR was \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{254 + 199}}{\\\\mbox{47.33 + 50}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{253 + 110}}{\\\\mbox{50 + 50}}, which is the same as \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{254}}{\\\\mbox{97.33}} + \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{199}}{\\\\mbox{97.33}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{253}}{\\\\mbox{100}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{110}}{\\\\mbox{100}}. Making the same replacements for 254 and 253 as before, and replacing 199 runs scored in match two with 3.98 runs per over x 50 overs, and 110 runs conceded in match two with 2.20 runs per over x 50 overs, this becomes: \\\\left(5.37\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{47.33}}{\\\\mbox{97.33}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(3.98\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{50}}{\\\\mbox{97.33}}\\\\right) - \\\\left(5.06\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{50}}{\\\\mbox{100}}\\\\right) - \\\\left(2.20\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{50}}{\\\\mbox{100}}\\\\right) =\\\\left(5.37\\\\times 48.6\\\\%\\\\right)+\\\\left(3.98\\\\times 51.4\\\\%\\\\right)-\\\\left(5.06\\\\times 50\\\\%\\\\right)-\\\\left(2.20\\\\times 50\\\\%\\\\right). After match three After their third match, tournament NRR was \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{254 + 199 + 225}}{\\\\mbox{47.33 + 50 + 50}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{253 + 110 + 103}}{\\\\mbox{50 + 50 + 50}}, i.e. \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{254}}{\\\\mbox{147.33}} + \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{199}}{\\\\mbox{147.33}} + \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{225}}{\\\\mbox{147.33}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{253}}{\\\\mbox{150}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{110}}{\\\\mbox{150}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{103}}{\\\\mbox{150}}. Making the same replacements for 254, 253, 199 and 110 as before, and replacing 225 runs scored in match three with 4.50 runs per over x 50 overs, and 103 runs conceded in match three with 2.06 runs per over x 50 overs, this becomes: \\\\left(5.37\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{47.33}}{\\\\mbox{147.33}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(3.98\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{50}}{\\\\mbox{147.33}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(4.50\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{50}}{\\\\mbox{147.33}}\\\\right) - \\\\left(5.06\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{50}}{\\\\mbox{150}}\\\\right) - \\\\left(2.20\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{50}}{\\\\mbox{150}}\\\\right) - \\\\left(2.06\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{50}}{\\\\mbox{150}}\\\\right) =\\\\left(5.37\\\\times 32.1\\\\%\\\\right) + \\\\left(3.98\\\\times 33.9\\\\%\\\\right) + \\\\left(4.50\\\\times 33.9\\\\%\\\\right) - \\\\left(5.06\\\\times 33.3\\\\%\\\\right) - \\\\left(2.20\\\\times 33.3\\\\%\\\\right) - \\\\left(2.06\\\\times 33.3\\\\%\\\\right). Tournament NRR as a weighted average Therefore, tournament NRR can alternatively be thought of as the weighted average of the run rates scored in each match (weighted by the lengths of the innings batted compared to the other innings batted), minus the weighted average of the run rates conceded in each match (weighted by the lengths of the innings bowled compared to the other innings bowled). Each time another match is played, the weights of the previous innings reduce, and so the contributions of the previous innings to overall NRR reduce. For example, the 5.37 run rate achieved in match one had 100% weighting after match one, 48.6% weighting after match two, and 32.1% weighting after match three. Criticisms =NRR does not accurately reflect margins of victory, as it takes no account of wickets lost= In the language of Duckworth-Lewis-Stern, teams have two resources with which to score runs − overs and wickets. However, NRR takes into account only one of these − overs faced; it takes no account of wickets lost. Therefore, a narrow victory can produce a higher NRR than a comfortable victory. For example, in the 2013 Champions Trophy Group A: *New Zealand just beat Sri Lanka by bowling them out for 138, then reaching 139–9 from 36.3 overs, giving them match NRR = (139/36.5) − (138/50) = 1.05. *Sri Lanka comfortably beat England by restricting them to 293–7 from 50 overs, then reaching 297–3 from 47.1 overs, giving them match NRR = (297/47.167) − (293/50) = 0.44. This fact can encourage a team to play in an overly aggressive manner, to maximise NRR by batting with next to no regard for preserving wickets, when the required run rate alone seems low, which can then put the team in danger of losing. =NRR may be manipulated= A team may choose to artificially reduce their margin of victory, as measured by NRR, to gain an additional advantage by not disadvantaging their opponent too much. For example, in the final round of matches in the 1999 World Cup Group B, Australia needed to beat West Indies to progress to the Super Six stage, but wanted to carry West Indies through with them to the Super Six, rather than New Zealand. This is because Australia would then have the additional points in the Super Six stage from beating West Indies in the group stage, whereas they had lost to New Zealand in the group stage. It was therefore to Australia's advantage to reduce their scoring rate and reduce their margin of victory, as measured by NRR, to minimise the negative impact of the match on West Indies' NRR, and therefore maximise West Indies' chance of going through with them. However, this is also likely to be a possibility with alternatives to NRR. This is similar to the way a narrow victory for one side in a game of football may enable both sides to progress to the next stage, e.g. West Germany v Austria in the 1982 World Cup. Alternatives to NRR A number of alternatives or modifications to NRR have been suggested. =Duckworth–Lewis–Stern= Use Tournament NRR as present, but when a side batting second successfully completes the run chase, use the Duckworth−Lewis method to predict how many runs they would have scored with a full innings. This means the calculation would be done on the basis of all innings being complete, and so would remove the criticisms of NRR penalising teams which bat second, and NRR not taking into account wickets lost. However, this does nothing to alter the fact that when matches are rain-affected, different matches and even two complete innings in one match, can be different lengths long (in terms of overs), and so does nothing about some of the other criticisms above. Therefore, alternatively, use Duckworth–Lewis–Stern to predict the 50-over total for every innings less than this, even, for example, if a match is reduced to 40 overs each, and a side completes their 40 overs. This would make every innings in the tournament the same length, so would remove all the criticisms above. However, a side will bat differently (less conservatively) in a 40-over innings compared to a 50-over innings, and so it is quite unfair to use their 40-over total to predict how many runs they could have scored in 50 overs. =Average of the match NRRs= Calculate tournament NRR as the total or average of the individual match NRRs. This would mean all matches have equal weighting, no matter how long they were, (rather than all batted overs across the tournament having equal weighting, and all bowled overs across the tournament having equal weighting). This would remove the criticisms under the 'Tournament NRR calculation' subheading above. For example, the different teams' tournament NRRs would always sum to zero if the total of the individual match NRRs were used, or if the average of the individual match NRRs were used and all teams had played the same number of games. An example of when using this would have made a difference was the 1999 Cricket World Cup Group B. New Zealand and West Indies finished level on points. Having scored a total of 723 runs from 201 overs, and conceded 746 runs from 240.4 overs, West Indies' tournament NRR was (723/201) − (746/240.6667) = 0.50. However, New Zealand had scored 817 runs from 196.1 overs, and conceded 877 runs from 244.2 overs, so their tournament NRR was (817/196.167) − (877/244.333) = 0.58. Therefore, New Zealand progressed to the Super Six stage and West Indies were eliminated. However, with individual match NRRs of −0.540, 0.295, 0.444, 5.525 and −0.530, the West Indies' average match NRR was 1.04, and with individual match NRRs of 1.225, 0.461, −0.444, −1.240 and 4.477, New Zealand's average match NRR was 0.90. Therefore, West Indies' average NRR was better than New Zealand's. =Head-to-head record or stage a play-off match= Split teams level on points using the results from the matches between them. However, this unfairly increases the importance of that one match and reduces the importance of other matches in the league, when all matches in a league should be of equal value − the team with the better head-to-head record will have a worse record against other teams. Also, the head-to-head record will not decide it if the game between them was a No result, or if they played each other twice, and won one game each. An example of where a team progressed further because of a head-to-head result taken into account, was in the 1999 World Cup semi-finals when South Africa vs Australia played to a draw but Australia progressed due to them beating South Africa in the group stages, even though South Africa won more matches. Alternatively, stage a play-off match between the teams level on points. However, organising this at very short notice may be difficult, or the teams may be in the middle of a league table with no promotion or relegation or progression at stake, so there may be no appetite for a play-off match. These two methods both also run into difficulties when three or more teams are level on points.

Childs was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, the son and grandson of Revolutionary War veterans. He graduated from West Point in 1814 and fought in the Niagara campaign during the War of 1812 as an officer of artillery. 190 px He was later sent to Florida where he fought against Indians during the Seminole Wars. For his distinguished services there he received a brevet promotion of lieutenant colonel in 1841. Sent to Texas, he took command of an artillery battalion which he commanded at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. He received a brevet to colonel for these two battles. At the battle of Monterrey, General William J. Worth placed Childs in charge of an attacking column composed of infantry and artillery. He successfully attacked the Bishop's Palace on the western end of the city. He transferred to Winfield Scott's army with the rest of the division and was Worth's chief-of-staff during the Siege of Veracruz. After the Battle of Cerro Gordo General Scott appointed Childs military governor of Jalapa and once Scott moved into the Valley of Mexico Childs was then appointed military governor of Puebla. He held this post during the battles for Mexico City. The day before Mexico City surrendered, Childs' garrison at Puebla came under siege. During the following siege of Puebla Childs repeatedly refused to surrender and was able to successfully repulse the Mexican attacks until a relief force under General Joseph Lane arrived and defeated the besiegers. For his defense of the city Childs was brevetted to brigadier general. After the war Childs was placed in command of Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor. He was then placed in charge of military operations in Florida. He died in his headquarters at Fort Brooke, and was buried at St. Paul's Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia.

On January 10, 1998, sister station 104.5 CHUM FM, which airs a hot adult contemporary format, revived the CHUM Chart name for a new countdown show. The CHUM Chart also aired as a television program on Citytv every Saturday at 2:00 P.M. until January 2008, when the show was discontinued after Rogers Communications gained control of the Citytv stations and replaced it with the JackNation chart, a show based on their Jack FM radio brand. The program aired a list of the most popular songs in the countdown, starting from No. 30, playing approximately half of them. From the chart's debut in 1957 until the launch of the national RPM chart magazine in 1964, the CHUM Chart was considered Canada's de facto national chart due to its status as the single most influential of the various local Top 40 charts. After 1964, however, RPM supplanted CHUM as the definitive national chart, although within Toronto the CHUM chart remained more influential while RPM was initially viewed as an upstart competitor rather than a national complement. History The chart debuted on May 27, 1957, under the name CHUM's Weekly Hit Parade. The CHUM Chart name was adopted in 1961. The chart was published for 1,512 consecutive weeks, and had 694 different number-one songs over the course of its original run. Its first number-one single was Elvis Presley's \\"All Shook Up\\", and its final number-one was Madonna's \\"Live to Tell\\". In the week of March 30, 1964, The Beatles simultaneously held ten spots in the top 40, placing at No. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 14, 29 and 39. One band, Mack Truck and the Exhaust Fumes, appeared as a hitbound entry on the CHUM Chart of September 19, 1966 despite not actually existing. In an informal experiment to test how accurate the chart reporting really was, program director Bob McAdorey placed a fake entry for a nonexistent song (called \\"The Queen\\") by the nonexistent band as a hitbound track (i.e., not actually on the chart, but listed in a separate section as a new song getting airplay.) Later tellings of the story had McAdorey being astonished when the song indeed started rising up the chart on the basis of listener requests and orders from record stores. However, this in fact never happened, as the song only appeared for one week as a hitbound, and was never listed on the chart proper. A similar stunt was tried the following year with a second nonexistent Mack Truck track called \\"It's Christmas Once Again\\", which appeared for one week as a hitbound on December 18, 1967. It too never appeared on the actual numbered chart. From its inception until 1975, each week's CHUM Chart was published in a brochure format, with additional features promoting the station and its personalities. It was distributed to record stores and music venues across the city and throughout the station's listening area in Southern Ontario. After the April 26, 1975 CHUM hit parade, the brochure was discontinued, and each week's chart was instead published in the entertainment section of the Toronto Sun until the end of 1976. From January 1977, the CHUM hit parades were weekly published in the entertainment section of the Toronto Star. Mike Myers, Gordon Lightfoot, Dick Clark and Dave Thomas all reportedly owned collections of CHUM Charts. For the first 26 weeks in 1957, the chart published full information only for the top 10, listing only song titles for the remainder of the chart. Because CHUM's frequency was 1050, the top TEN hits were printed in large, boldface type, with the rest of the top FIFTY following in smaller type. On November 25, 1957, the chart began publishing information on all listed songs. In 1959, the chart briefly added a Top 10 albums list, which was discontinued in 1960, revived in 1963, discontinued again in 1967, revived again in 1972, expanded to a top 15 list in 1975, and finally discontinued permanently in 1979. (At this point, sister station CHUM FM initiated their own separate top 30 album chart.) Author Ron Hall published The CHUM Chart Book () in 1983, listing every song that had appeared in the CHUM Charts to that point. To commemorate the 1500th chart, for the week of March 15, 1986, trivia questions were asked during its sneak preview broadcast. Winners won a poster format of the chart and 45s of the week's top 30 singles. Following the discontinuation of the chart, Hall published an updated edition in 1990 listing every charted song and profiling the history of the chart. The final chart, for the week of June 14, 1986, was never published until Hall's 1990 book. A commemorative list of all the chart's number one songs was also published in poster format by CHUM in 2007 to commemorate the station's 50th anniversary.

B. Sweeney, and Randy Quaid. Plot When an undercover detective is shot dead while investigating a string of Porsche 911 thefts, Lieutenant Vincent Bracey assigns 22-year-old San Diego officer Benjamin \\"Benjy\\" Taylor to infiltrate a Porsche garage suspected to be a front for the grand theft auto scheme. Benjy is chosen because of his extensive mechanical knowledge of German cars and his rookie status, which dissuades others from suspecting that he is a cop. Bracey wants Benjy to obtain evidence that millionaire playboy Ted Varrick is the mastermind behind the thefts and the murder of the detective. Using the alias \\"Billy Ayles\\", Benjy moves to Los Angeles and gets a job at Technique Porsche as a mechanic. After Benjy fixes Ted's Porsche one night, the two men become close friends, and Benjy becomes romantically attached to Ted's sister Ann. Benjy also discovers the presence of a rival syndicate led by Frank Martin, which leads him to believe that Ted is not the prime suspect despite Bracey's insistence. Eventually, Ted brings Benjy into his side business of stealing Porsches, with garage manager Malcolm coordinating the operations. Benjy's first few attempts at stealing cars fail miserably, with Frank's syndicate catching on and slashing his hand as a warning. While doing a job at the mall, Benjy and Ted are confronted by Frank and his thugs, but they manage to lose them in a lengthy car chase. Ted rewards Benjy with a red Porsche that night. The next day, Ted goes to Technique Porsche and finds Malcolm has been murdered. In retaliation, he kills Frank at a night club. During a phone conversation at a party, corrupt police Lieutenant Curtis Loos - who was hired by Ted to take out the detective in the film's opening - tells Ted about Benjy's real identity. The next night, Ted has Benjy meet Loos at a warehouse for a payoff. When Loos tries to kill Benjy, Ted runs him over to save his friend in spite of what he knows. Later, Benjy stops at Bracey's house to inform him of what happened with Loos, and accuses the Lieutenant of conspiring with him. Bracey kicks Benjy out, but tells him to call in the morning so they can work things out. Benji drives off, unaware that Ted is nearby, spying on him. The next day, Benjy's cover is blown in front of Ann when his uncle Mike pays him a visit at his apartment. He goes to Bracey's house, only to find that Ted has murdered him. Ted is preparing to flee the country when Benjy convinces him to meet up at the mall, where he tries to arrest Ted for the murders. Ted refuses to go quietly and a gunfight breaks out; Benjy is wounded, but manages to shoot and kill Ted. Cast * Charlie Sheen as Ted Varrick * D. B. Sweeney as Benjamin \\"Benjy\\" Taylor a.k.a.

He was a fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. Biography The son of Noel Gray Frere, of the Colonial Service, and his wife Agnes (née Sutherland), Sheppard \\"Sam\\" Frere was born in 1916. He was educated at Lancing College and Magdalene College, Cambridge.Telegraph obituary, 13.3.15 He was a master at Epsom College from 1938–41, and became classics master and housemaster at Lancing College from 1945 to 1954, when he was in charge of the excavations at Canterbury during his summer vacations. He made a number of broadcasts about his work at that time. He left Lancing in 1954 to become a university lecturer in archaeology at the University of Manchester. His family details and dates are given under the family of 'Frere' in Burke's Landed Gentry for 1969. For three seasons early in the 1970s, he was in charge of the archaeological summer school that excavated the Roman fort at Strageath, near Crieff, in Perthshire. Between 1955 and 1961 he excavated at Verulamium. He then became Professor of the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the University of London from 1961 to 1966 before becoming Professor of the Archaeology of the Roman Empire at Oxford University, where his communicative lectures at the Archaeological Institute, almost always illustrated with visual tools, on Iron Age and Roman Britain and the Rhine frontier of the Roman Empire were well attended. He was married in 1961 to Janet, daughter of Edward Graham Hoare, and had two children, Sarah Barbara Ruth (born 1962) and Bartle Henry David Hoare (born 1963). He was a 4th cousin of paleontologist Mary Leakey.Mary Leakey, Disclosing the Past: an autobiography, Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1984, p. 14.

The mayor of Tel Aviv gave evidence as a defence witness said that he approved of the Haganah as a defensive organization to protect life and property. According to the president of the court, W.

Saints Chrysanthus and Daria (3rd century – c. 283) are saints of the Early Christian period. Their names appear in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, an early martyrs list, and a church was built in their honour over their reputed burial place in Rome. Legend Acts of the Martyrs relating the legend of Chrysanthus and Daria exist in a Greek and in Latin versions, dating from the fifth century and all \\"without historical value\\", according to Johann Peter Kirsch, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia. According to legend, Chrysanthus was the only son of an Egyptian patrician, named Polemius or Poleon, who lived during the reign of Numerian. His father moved from Alexandria to Rome. Chrysanthus was educated in the finest manner of the era. Disenchanted with the excess in the Roman world, he began reading the Acts of the Apostles.\\"Martyr Daria and those with her at Rome\\", Orthodox Church in America He was then baptized and educated in Christian thinking by a priest named Carpophorus. His father was unhappy with Chrysanthus's conversion and attempted to inculcate secular ways into his son by arranging a marriage to Daria, a Roman priestess of Minerva. (Other accounts state that she was a Vestal Virgin.) Chrysanthus managed to convert his wife, and the couple agreed to lead celibate lives. They went on to convert a number of Romans. When this was made known to Claudius, the tribune, Chrysanthus was arrested and tortured. Chrysanthus's faith and fortitude under torture were so impressive to Claudius that he and his wife, Hilaria, two sons named Maurus and Jason, and seventy of his soldiers became Christians. For this betrayal, the emperor had Claudius drowned, his sons beheaded and his wife went to the gallows. The legend states that Daria was sent to live as a prostitute, but her chastity was defended by a lioness. She was brought before Numerian and ordered to be executed. There are many variations to this legend. Some claim that she was subjected to execution by stoning, others say she was beheaded and yet others claim she was buried alive in a deep pit beside her husband. It appears this torment was chosen in order to inflict on Daria the death reserved for unfaithful vestals.Guerin, Paul. \\"Saint Chrysanthus and Saint Daria\\", Les Petits Bollandistes: Vies des Saints, (Bloud et Barral: Paris, 1882), Vol. 12 They were entombed in a sand pit near the Via Salaria Nova, the catacombs in Rome. The surviving \\"Acts\\" of Chrysanthus and Daria state that on the anniversary of their deaths, a large number of Christians had gathered at their underground crypt to pay their respects when Roman persecutors surprised them, filled the crypt with stones and buried them all alive, including Diodorus, a priest, and Marianus, a deacon. Historical notes Numerian was never in Rome. The Romans would not have sent a Vestal virgin, who was supposed to be the keeper of Rome's fortunes and for whom it was imperative to remain a virgin, into a whorehouse. Candida Moss states \\"this simply could not have happened...whoever composed this story lived during a period when people no longer understood how important vestals were.\\" Relics At least three places claim to possess the remains of Chrysanthus and Daria. In the ninth century, their reputed remains were brought to Prüm in modern-day Rhineland-Palatinate, and these relics are presently in the church of Chrysanthus and Daria, Bad Münstereifel, Germany. In 1011, Pope Sergius IV gave Fulk III, Count of Anjou, the reputed bodies of Chrysanthus and Daria upon his return from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Fulk gave them to the monastery of Belli Locus (now Beaulieu-lès-Loches), which he had recently established. The cathedral of Reggio Emilia in northern Italy also contains relics reputed to be those of Daria and Chrysanthus. A scientific study of some of the bones there confirmed that they were those of a young man and a young woman in their late teens, with a radiocarbon date between 80 and 340.

Stories produced by the Derby Telegraph team are published online under the Derbyshire Live brand. History In 1857, Richard Keene was publishing the Derby Telegraph every Saturday. His business was in the Irongate district of Derby. His family was to include Alfred John Keene who was a local painter whose work is displayed in the Derby Art Gallery. Another paper was first published in 1879 by Eliza Pike. It was known at the time as the Derby Daily Telegraph and was a four- page broadsheet which cost a halfpenny. Historical copies of the Derby Daily Telegraph, dating back to 1879, are available to search and view in digitised form at The British Newspaper Archive.Digitised copies of the Derby Daily Telegraph The first editor was W.J. Piper who stayed in the post until he died in 1918. He was succeeded by William Gilman who in 1927, saw the paper sold three times in a series of months, eventually ending up in the hands of Northcliffe Newspaper Group, which was part of Daily Mail and General Trust plc. The same company also publishes the Telegraph Lite - a weekly advertising-funded free newspaper. The paper was originally based at the Corn Market in the town centre, It was refurbished in 1918 after the First World War but it outgrew these premises in 1929 and moved to the Corn Exchange. It stayed there until 1981 when it moved to purpose-built premises in Meadow Road. In November 2014 it moved to its present office location at 2, Siddals Road.

Competitions Until the late 1990s, the newspaper ran the annual Miss Derby Evening Telegraph competition. Entrants had to be female, aged 17–25, never married and never had children. In 2012, the Derby Telegraph launched the Local Business Accelerator competition with the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce. The businesses deemed to have most potential won mentoring, free advertising and chamber membership. Mackney Photography, Splash Fit Gym and Essere Bella beauty salon were the winners in 2012. In 2013, the winners were Eve of St Agnes, Status Social and the Derby Brewing Company. Content Before the 1970s, the newspaper (in its broadsheet form) often had national news stories on its front page, with weighty current affairs stories. The coverage of national and local news stories was almost 50:50. Distribution It is published daily from Monday to Saturday and is the principal local newspaper for Derby and surrounding parts of south Derbyshire. The newspaper has a local focus with usually just two pages reserved for national and international news. Back issues from 1879 until the present day can be viewed at the Derby Local Studies Library or the British Library Newspaper Collection at Colindale, London. Current average circulation is 20,090 daily (as of 01/10/2015)http://www.nsdatabase.co.uk/newspaperdetail.cfm?paperid=285 The paper was known as the Derby Evening Telegraph until April 2009 when it changed its name to simply the Derby Telegraph. This was because only one edition was now published per day and available in the morning, which would have rendered the use of the word \\"Evening\\" in the title as misleading. For many years, the name \\"Derby\\" had not featured in the paper's front page masthead. The change of name involved the word \\"Evening\\" being substituted by \\"Derby\\" in the masthead. The masthead font has been unchanged since 1975.

Michael is the central character of the series, serving as the Regional Manager of the Scranton branch of a paper distribution company, known as Dunder Mifflin Inc. from seasons 1 through 7. However, he temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin to form the Michael Scott Paper Company with Pam Beesly and Ryan Howard toward the end of the 5th season and shares a co-managerial position with Jim Halpert during a 6th season arc from \\"The Meeting\\" to \\"The Manager and the Salesman\\". In the end of the 7th season, he proposes to HR representative Holly Flax and moves to Colorado to take care of her aging parents, leaving the manager position to Deangelo Vickers in \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", to Andy Bernard in season 8, after Vickers becomes brain dead, and ultimately to Dwight Schrute in season 9. For his performance, Carell received critical acclaim and was nominated for 6 Emmy awards as well as winning a Golden Globe.  Casting  upright All original series characters were adapted for the U.S. version. NBC programmer Tracy McLaughlin suggested Paul Giamatti to producer Ben Silverman for the role of Michael Scott, but the actor declined. Martin Short, Hank Azaria, and Bob Odenkirk were also reported to be interested. In January 2004, Variety reported Steve Carell of the popular Comedy Central program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, was in talks to play the role. At the time, he was already committed to another NBC mid- season replacement comedy, Come to Papa. Due to Carell being unavailable, Bob Odenkirk was selected as Michael Scott and was part of the cast presented to NBC executives. However, Come to Papa was quickly canceled, allowing Carell to commit to The Office. Odenkirk went on to appear in the series in a brief role as an office manager reminiscent of Scott. Carell later stated he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the British series before he auditioned. He did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying Gervais' characterizations. On the audio commentary of the pilot episode, director Ken Kwapis says that Carell's unfamiliarity with the British version of The Office and their experience working together on Watching Ellie influenced him being cast as Scott.Carell, Steve (Actor). 2005. \\"Pilot\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season One (U.S./NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. Two supporting roles in films helped get the attention of audiences: Bruce Almighty, in which Carell plays Evan Baxter (an arrogant rival to Jim Carrey's character), who gets a humorous comeuppance while co- anchoring the news. In Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Carell plays another news personality, as slow-witted weatherman Brick Tamland. Although the series premiered to mediocre ratings, NBC renewed it for another season because of the anticipated success of Carell's movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and the show subsequently became a ratings success. Carell won a Golden Globe and Television Critics Association award in 2006 for his role. He also received Emmy nominations in 2006, 2007 and 2011 for his work in the series. Although The 40-Year-Old Virgin was a surprise success, Carell revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he had no plans to leave The Office. However, on the BBC Radio 5 Live Film Review show, he stated in an interview that his time on the show would probably end after his contract ran out after Season 7. This was later confirmed on June 28, 2010, when Carell confirmed that the seventh season of the show was to be his last after his contract with NBC expired.  Character information, arc, and backstory  = Biography = Michael Gary Scott was born on March 15, 1964 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He came from a relatively difficult childhood of loneliness. Michael had some trouble with his early education, shown in \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\" as Michael tells the camera crew he was held back from second grade. In \\"Diversity Day\\", Michael claims to be of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. He also claims to be \\"two-fifteenths\\" Native American. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff, whom he despises. In \\"Nepotism\\", it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister, from whom he was estranged for 15 years. As a consequence of their reunion, Michael hires his nephew Luke as an intern for the office, but eventually confronts the incompetent and rude Luke and ends up spanking him in front of the office, leading Luke to burst into tears and quit. In the episode \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\", Michael makes the claim that he was a child star on a kids' show called Fundle Bundle; however, it becomes clear that he simply appeared on the show as one of many guest children. In the old recording being played, he speaks touchingly about what he wanted when he grew up: get married, have \\"100 kids\\" so he could then have \\"100 friends\\" and none of them could say no to being his friend. Michael did not attend college, having lost all his tuition money in a pyramid scheme. Michael started at Dunder Mifflin as a salesman in the 1990s. Dwight praised him in a deleted scene from \\"The Coup\\" for winning consecutive awards for best salesman. In \\"Two Weeks\\", he claims to have acquired half of the Scranton branch client base. In \\"The Client\\", he impresses his then-manager, Jan Levinson-Gould, by single-handedly acquiring an important client through somewhat unorthodox methods. Both Pam Halpert and Ryan Howard are impressed watching him make sales and negotiate their contracts when working in The Michael Scott Paper Company. Even Jim Halpert concedes that he might never become as good a salesman as Michael in \\"Koi Pond\\". During a candid conversation in \\"The Fire\\", Michael tells Ryan that he became a salesman because he loved to make friends. After being promoted to regional manager at a young age, he continued to treat work-related relationships as personal friendships. He acknowledges the difficulty because his colleagues are all lower than him in the workplace's hierarchy. He seems to have few relationships outside the office. In his interactions with other characters, Michael is shallow, callous, ignorant and unaware of basic social norms. He tends to overestimate his own importance in the eyes of his coworkers and cannot understand why they do not share his enthusiasm. Michael believes an office should be the \\"place where dreams come true.\\" He is loyal to the company and honestly tries to help his employees when he thinks they are having a problem. Michael has been at Dunder Mifflin (as of \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\") 9,986,000 minutes, which means that he has been working there since May 6, 1992. Michael's constant desire to be the center of attention often manifests itself in selfish behavior. For example, when he burns his foot in \\"The Injury\\", he expects Pam and Ryan to tend to his needs, despite Dwight's much more serious concussion. When invited to \\"Phyllis' Wedding\\", he assumes his participation will be the high point of the ceremony. He pouts when he is upstaged by Phyllis' elderly father, eventually giving an insulting and overly familiar toast that gets him banned from the reception altogether. His desire to be liked often leads him to make unwise decisions or unfeasible promises without considering the consequences, only to back out when they result in an undesirable comeuppance. Michael appears to emphasize moments of sympathy or civility directed at him by his coworkers (mostly Jim) and inflates their importance in order to compensate for his loneliness. Michael is irresponsible with his finances, and at one point is so heavily in debt he has to take up a second job as a telemarketer. Oscar makes a chart of Michael's spending habits and chides him for spending too much money on things \\"nobody ever needs\\" like multiple magic sets and professional bass fishing equipment. Eventually, Michael is forced to declare bankruptcy (which he thinks requires only standing up and shouting \\"I declare bankruptcy!\\") Due to his overall lack of common sense, Michael can withstand significant abuse from his peers and is often the butt of jokes. He is quick to take offense when wronged and his response is often disproportionate to the harm suffered. Similarly, when he unintentionally offends people, he will apologize. The most notable example of \\"Gay Witch Hunt\\" when he cries after realizing his use of the term \\"faggy\\" hurt Oscar's feelings. Even though he is generally oblivious to criticism, derision and sarcasm, Michael has some limits to his patience, and leaves to question the extent of offense that he can actually acknowledge (demanding professional respect from Stanley Hudson in \\"Did I Stutter?\\" or standing up to the employees in favor of Holly in \\"Business Ethics\\"). In \\"The Meeting\\", it is shown Michael does not aim for his employees' betterment or his own, thinking that this would put his job in jeopardy. He unwittingly turns down a promotion that would put Jim in his position, choosing the status quo over his employees' ambitions. He sabotages Jim with a bad recommendation, mistakenly believing Jim's promotion would lead to his firing. He does, however, concede to a co-managerial position with Jim to avoid losing him. Being a lifelong hopeless romantic, Michael has had several romantic relationships, most notably with Jan who had become too domineering over him thus forcing him to end their relationship. He eventually settled with Holly as she shared a similar sense of humor with him. He eventually quit Dunder Mifflin and moved to Boulder, Colorado to help her care for her ailing parents. They got married and had four kids together, while Governor John Hickenlooper appointed him as Director of Paper Distribution in the Department of Natural Resources. = Interests = Michael's catchphrase is \\"That's what she said!\\", which he uses whenever someone, intentionally or not, makes a sexually suggestive double entendre, including business meetings and legal depositions. Michael finds uttering the phrase so irresistible that in \\"Sexual Harassment\\", he is goaded by Jim into saying it just seconds after Jan Levinson and a lawyer from Corporate specifically asked him to stop. He has diverse interests in media. Song parody writing is often referred to: in \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", he relates the titles of two of his songs, \\"Beers in Heaven\\" (Tears In Heaven parody) and \\"Total Eclipse of the Fart\\" (Total Eclipse of the Heart parody), before singing a rendition of \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" as a departing gesture to Toby. He performs his parody of \\"The Chanukah Song\\" to reflect the Diwali celebration Kelly hosted. In \\"Dream Team\\", he comes up with \\"Achey Breaky Fart\\" (Achy Breaky Heart parody) and \\"My Stumps\\" (My Humps parody) during a brainstorming exercise. He hopes to finish the video production of his script, \\"Threat Level: Midnight\\", whose script was found and read by the office and whose finished movie (after ten years of production) was viewed in the seventh- season episode of the same name. Michael adores the theatrical stylings of Meryl Streep, describing her in \\"The Job\\" as the \\"best actor around,\\" and mimics her character from The Devil Wears Prada after seeing the film. He loves Wikipedia and YouTube, although he doesn't seem to really understand how they work and believes them to be news media organizations. Michael also likes the music of Billy Joel and U2; the movies Mean Girls, Million Dollar Baby, Die Hard, What a Girl Wants; and television series such as ALF, Entourage, The L Word and Queer as Folk. Michael tends to be a bit \\"behind\\" when it comes to popular culture references, such as when he refers to his then-girlfriend Jan's youthful male assistant as James Van Der Beek or in his numerous ringtones, including \\"My Humps,\\" \\"Mambo Number Five\\" and Salt N Pepa. He appears to have a history of playing ice hockey and demonstrates his talent in \\"Michael's Birthday\\". In high school, after his math teacher told him he was going to flunk out, he went out the next day and \\"scored more goals than anyone in the history of the hockey team.\\" He also has invited potential clients to \\"Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins\\" games. On multiple occasions, Michael has also expressed interest in basketball even though he is terrible (in \\"The Fire\\", \\"Basketball\\" and \\"Goodbye, Michael\\"). Michael is a Pittsburgh Pirates fan, and does not like the New York Mets. Other interests include a pair of Levi's he refers to as \\"fun jeans\\", which he has professionally dry cleaned and the reason he started Casual Fridays; his self-bought \\"World's Best Boss\\" mug from Spencer Gifts; and Chrysler automobiles. He drives a silver 2004 Sebring convertible for the first three seasons until he trades it in with Jan's Volvo for a shared Porsche Boxster in the episode \\"Money\\". After their relationship, he drives a red PT Cruiser convertible and later a newer- model Sebring as a benefit of the buyout of the Michael Scott Paper Company to Dunder Mifflin in \\"Broke\\". Michael enjoys planning fantasy entrepreneurial schemes that he would like to start, such as a men's shoe store called \\"Shoe La La\\", or another paper company simply called \\"Michael\\". = Personality and management style = Apart from his masterful salesmanship, Michael is lacking in almost any other skills, management or otherwise. Jim Halpert once made a color graph of how Michael spends his time: 80% distracting others; 19% procrastination; and 1% critical thinking. Jim added that he inflated the \\"critical thinking\\" percentage so people could actually see it on the graph. His laid-back approach more often results in lower than expected workplace productivity, particularly when Michael places personal interests as a priority over work (such as his birthday, someone else's birthday, or his various seminars). To avoid being disciplined for his foolish actions, Michael often resorts to scapegoating employees to cover himself. Although his actions often lead to more problems for his employees, Michael believes that Scranton is \\"the cool, fun branch... like Animal House\\". He is genuinely upset when the top salesman from the Utica office trashes Scranton in a phone call by saying it's \\"worse than Camden\\". Although his position as Regional Manager gives him broad decision-making authority on branch operations, he often places those responsibilities secondary to his desire to be friends with his employees. On the other hand, he also oversteps his authority by hosting events that Corporate disapproves of, such as The Dundies and several office parties a year, inducing birthday parties for each employee despite only being allowed the budget for one a year. It is revealed in the episode \\"The Duel\\" the Scranton branch is the best-performing company branch, well ahead of Utica and Nashua. Michael is called to corporate headquarters to answer the question, \\"What are you doing right?\\" After several minutes of Michael's inarticulate babble, his superiors concede that while Michael is definitely doing something right, they will probably never know exactly what. They send him on a lecture tour to spread his wisdom; instead, he wastes time and annoys the workers who have to listen to his drivel. Despite his ineptitude, Michael is prone to brief bouts of surprising insight and is shown to have a kind heart as he shows deep, family-like affection towards the people working in the Scranton branch. The staff initially finds Michael annoying but he grows on them and is given emotional goodbyes during his final days in Scranton. In the episode \\"Broke\\", Michael displays self-awareness of his inability to keep secrets when he, Pam and Ryan all agree not to let Dunder Mifflin know the Michael Scott Paper Company is broke. Moments later he is seen bent over and in a panic when he admits that he's afraid he won't be able to keep himself from letting the truth slip. In the same episode, he displays a remarkable ability to negotiate with Dunder Mifflin and convince the company to hire himself as well as Pam and Ryan back with full benefits. In the episode \\"Murder\\", Jim attempts to confront Michael for wasting time when he has the staff participate in a murder-mystery role playing game. However, he is confronted by an unusually serious and stern Michael, who demands to, \\"just let them [the staff] have this game\\". Jim then realized Michael actually was trying to distract the staff from the possibility of losing their jobs after a news article hinted at Dunder Mifflin going bankrupt. In the episode \\"Business School\\", Michael is one of the few Dunder Mifflin employees to show up to Pam's gallery showing. Unlike Oscar and his then-boyfriend Gil, who had shown up and were critical of Pam's drawings (which Pam overheard), Michael immediately marvels at her work and asks to buy Pam's drawing of their office building. In a moment of sincere kindness, Michael tells Pam that he is very proud of her. Pam begins to tear up and hugs him. During \\"The Seminar\\", Michael advises a fledgling Andy Bernard to step up and begin selling at a seminar Andy is hosting, in order to boost his sagging sales. Michael's habits of joking around and treating professional colleagues as personal friends are often inappropriate for management. However, along with his encyclopedic knowledge of the paper industry, it is remarkably effective when utilized to sign clients, as seen in \\"The Client\\" and \\"Heavy Competition.\\" In \\"Initiation\\", Pam balks at Michael's sugar-fueled phone calls to a local business, but later realizes that his silly conversation (including a Bill Cosby imitation) helped to secure a major sale for Dunder-Mifflin. He remembers people through word association starting with nicknames such as \\"baldy\\" and \\"fatso\\" which, while offensive to the individuals in question, works to his advantage. Although he is unsuccessful using his sales methods as a telemarketer in \\"Money\\", his social interactions with coworkers suggest that he would be a more popular presence in an office of peers as opposed to subordinates. It is clear Michael loves Dunder Mifflin very much. He has also shown signs of feeling underappreciated, given his long history with the company. In the episode \\"The Negotiation\\", Michael discovers that he is making only slightly more money than Darryl, the warehouse manager, despite working for the company for 14 years. Later in the episode he drives to New York and demands a raise from Jan at corporate headquarters. In the episode \\"New Boss\\", Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace ducks Michael's calls throughout the day. When Michael's 15-year anniversary party is cancelled by his new superior, Charles Miner, he drives to New York to confront Wallace. Citing his long history of service and many sacrifices, Michael asks that he be treated more respectfully. Wallace, seeing his heartfelt openness, promises Michael his party and pledges to attend. Michael surprisingly recognizes that the CFO is just humoring him, and stuns Wallace by quitting his job. Relationships Michael tends to overestimate his importance to his employees, but despite constantly offending some of them, he has a close bond with them. Most of the employees have been the focus of Michael's jokes at one point or another, usually in reference to their race, sex, size, attractiveness, or sexual orientation. Examples of Michael's difficult relationship with his staff include getting slapped by Kelly for being racist, hitting Meredith with his car, getting kicked out of Phyllis and Bob's wedding, and outing Oscar to the entire office without his permission. They are, however, generally sympathetic to his shortcomings and, while regularly losing patience when he interrupts their workflow, often try to assist him with his personal problems. Michael's relationship with the company warehouse employees is tense. He has a tendency to disrupt their daily work flow, and in a talking head interview, warehouse supervisor Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) explains that they have never been able to make a full year accident-free because of Michael's antics. CFO David Wallace tolerates Michael's antics because he values his loyalty to the company, but Michael offends CEO Allan and the rest of the executives during his only meeting with them. Although many Dunder Mifflin employees are initially barely able to tolerate Michael, they gradually grow to appreciate his sincere intentions, even at times coming to find amusement in his sophomoric humor and behavior; this transition is most apparent in Pam Halpert, with whom he eventually develops a genuine friendship. His co-workers are overjoyed when Michael finds his soulmate in Holly Flax, participate in his romantic proposal to her and are shown to be emotional at his leaving Scranton to be with her. Jim Halpert even teared up while calling Michael \\"the best boss [he] ever had.\\" =Dwight Schrute= Dwight has the most respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for success, and is thrilled when asked to handle any task given to him, however ill- conceived it may be. Although on the surface, Michael usually appears dismissive of Dwight and generally views him as a suck-up, he is genuinely hurt and angry at the few times when Dwight has deceived him, such as when Dwight went over Michael's head to vie for the manager's job or when Dwight refused to reveal office secrets to Michael's new company, the \\"Michael Scott Paper Company\\". In the episode \\"Heavy Competition\\" of Season 5, Dwight steals Michael's Rolodex and finds his own business card, on the back of which, Michael had written (before leaving Dunder Mifflin): \\"Dwight Schrute, tall, beets\\". Michael also cares how Dwight feels about him. After Michael beats Dwight at his own dojo, Michael finds out that Dwight no longer wanted Michael as his primary contact in case of an emergency which causes Michael to promote him from \\"Assistant to the Regional Manager\\" to \\"Assistant Regional Manager\\", with a three-month probational period. Dwight told Michael in Season 6 that Michael's pathetic career path hurt Dwight and he regretted working for him instead of taking a fast-track job at Home Depot, but they buried their differences later on. When Deangelo Vickers arrives to be the new Branch Manager, Dwight is depressed that he didn't get the job after Michael recommended him, only to learn from Gabe that Michael didn't recommend him after all. At first Dwight is angry with Michael, but they make amends when Michael gives him a letter of recommendation on his final day at Dunder Mifflin. They end the day with a paintball fight behind the building. In the series finale, Michael is the best man at Dwight's wedding after Jim arranges it. =Ryan Howard= Michael has one-sided affection for Ryan, which often makes Ryan uncomfortable. Examples of this are when Michael gives Ryan the \\"Hottest in the Office\\" award in The Dundies, when Michael declares he would definitely want to have sex with Ryan in The Fire, and when Michael gives Ryan a $400 iPod for the Secret Santa gift exchange, despite the 20-dollar limit. In \\"The Deposition\\", a page from Michael's diary reveals he describes Ryan as \\"just as hot as Jan, but in a different way.\\" In multiple occasions, Michael behaves inappropriately around Ryan, including slapping Ryan's buttocks, pinching Ryan's nipples, staring constantly at Ryan from behind his window blind, pinning Ryan to sit on his lap and making kissing gestures toward Ryan while calling him the belle of the ball. Michael is devastated when he finds out about Ryan's arrest for fraud, and much to the dismay of David Wallace, he later re-hires Ryan. In \\"Prince Family Paper\\", Michael acknowledges that his heart has led him astray before, naming Jan and Ryan as examples of this. In \\"Dream Team\\", Michael convinces Ryan to leave his job at the bowling alley and join his newly formed paper company. When working together, Ryan comes to respect Michael's skills as a salesman. In Season 7, Michael heavily invests in Ryan's WUPHF.com and won't agree to sell his majority shares when it is clear Ryan is exploiting Michael's goodwill and is incapable of saving the venture from bankruptcy. Michael's obsession with Ryan is further shown in a number of deleted scenes. In one from \\"Diwali\\", Carol says that Michael constantly talks about Ryan's attractiveness and has begun stalking Ryan. In another from \\"Safety Training\\", Michael confesses that he will miss Ryan the most after dying, which angers Ryan. In a deleted scene of \\"Beach Games\\", Michael says he especially wants to see Ryan put a hot dog in his mouth. In \\"Night Out\\", Michael is in bed with Ryan asking \\"Do you miss us?,\\" to which Ryan declines to answer. = Jim and Pam Halpert = Michael doesn't hesitate to compliment or criticize Pam for her looks and he frequently mentions her breasts. In the episode \\"Diwali\\" Michael mistakenly thinks that he and Pam have a connection, and is rejected when he tries to kiss her. Throughout their relationship, Pam has served as something of a shoulder angel for Michael by encouraging him to be more productive and discouraging his bad ideas, with varying degrees of success. She grows closer to Michael as he supports her goals in pursuing sales and art. Pam is visibly touched when, after many art show attendees dismiss her artwork, Michael is so impressed that he asks to buy her painting of their office building. Their relationship comes to a rocky point when he begins dating her mother Helene. This is only repaired after he breaks up with Helene and allows Pam to slap him in the face in the parking lot. He trusts and respects Jim, although when they were co-managers they clashed due to their polar-opposite management styles. In \\"Secret Santa\\", Michael mentions that in a future vision he sees himself and his future wife living next door to Jim and Pam and that their children will play together. He often also refers to Jim as his best friend in the office, although, based on his impersonation of Jim using surfer slang in \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", does not have a very good understanding of his personality. While Jim and Pam are both shown to care about Michael, his clingy nature makes them reluctant to socialize with him outside of the office; such as when, after numerous unsuccessful invitations, Michael is forced to trick them in order to have them over for a disastrous dinner in the episode \\"Dinner Party.\\" In a Season 5 episode, Michael also shows his admiration for Jim, when Jim wears a tuxedo to work and goes on and on about having a 'classy party' for the party planning committee, and frequently suggests all of the ideas Dwight had offered that Michael had then rejected, only to bother Dwight by having Michael accept the same ideas from him. During Cecilia Halpert's baptism, Michael approaches Pam referring to himself as \\"the godfather\\" while imitating Don Corleone, after which she sympathetically but emphatically asks him to acknowledge that he won't be Cece's godfather, he is disappointed but does so and is hurt to learn that the godparents are a couple they'd only recently met. Pam is shown to have a soft spot for Michael, such as when she consoles him after he finds Holly to be in a relationship with AJ, and when she advises him on how to propose to Holly. In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\" it is revealed that Michael is secretly planning to leave for Colorado at the end of his penultimate work day, thereby avoiding having to say goodbye to everyone. Jim figures this out and goes along with it, telling Michael that he will tell him what a great boss he was the following day at lunch, which they both know Michael will not be around for; Michael and Jim both get sentimental during this final conversation between them. The strength of his relationship with Pam is revealed as he continuously asks about her whereabouts, not wanting to leave without saying goodbye. Pam, who spent the better part of the day away from the office, finds Michael at the airport and says goodbye in a touching scene just as he's about to board his plane for Colorado. She watches from the window as his plane flies off. In a deleted scene of \\"The Inner Circle\\", Pam is flattered that Michael named his new dog \\"Pamela Beagsley.\\" Pam later teases Jim that their second child will be named \\"little Michael Scott\\" displaying the friendship she had developed with her former boss. In the series finale, Jim convinces Michael to replace him as the \\"bestest mensch\\" at Dwight's wedding. Pam is so thrilled to see photos of Michael's children that she does not judge him for paying for two phones to hold all the pictures. =Toby Flenderson= Despite liking the majority of the staff, Michael fiercely hates Human Resources Manager Toby Flenderson, likely due to Toby's requirement to enforce the rules of proper office behavior that Michael loves to flout. Michael once reasoned that \\"Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. He's also divorced so he's not a part of his family either\\". His longtime goal is to get rid of Toby and any attempts at reconciliation between the two usually backfire, with Michael resorting to name calling or jokes at Toby's expense. In the episode \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", Michael is thrilled when Toby decides to move to Costa Rica and gives as his going away present a rock with a note that reads \\"Suck on this\\". The next season, after Toby's replacement Holly is transferred, Michael is horrified when Toby returns to Dunder Mifflin. In \\"Frame Toby\\", he goes to great lengths to get him fired, trying to frame him for possession of marijuana (which turns out to be a caprese salad). In \\"The Chump\\", Michael says if he had a gun with two bullets and was in a room with Adolf Hitler, Osama bin Laden, and Toby, he would shoot Toby twice (which disgusts the rest of the office). In \\"Nepotism\\", after Michael spanks Luke, the office intern who is also his nephew, he is ordered to attend counseling sessions moderated by Toby, much to Michael's horror. At first Michael is uncooperative but is gradually tricked by Toby into discussing therapeutic details of his life and childhood. In \\"Classy Christmas\\", Michael is happy to hear the news that Toby is going to be on a leave of absence for jury duty and that Holly will be taking his place. In \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", Michael eggs Toby's house in the cold open while yelling, \\"you suck\\", while he and Deangelo are handing out Dundie nominations. Ironically, Michael is shown to have befriended Toby's daughter Sasha in \\"Take Your Daughter to Work\\". In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Michael is seen saying goodbye to Toby without insulting him, possibly indicating that he will miss Toby on some level. Toby suggests Michael visit his brother Rory, who also lives in Colorado. =Erin Hannon= Once Pam is promoted to salesperson following Dunder Mifflin's buyout of The Michael Scott Paper Company, Michael keeps Erin Hannon as her replacement. Her real name is Kelly, although, since there was already Kelly Kapoor, she mentions that she has always wanted to be called by her middle name, Erin. Michael is initially unkind to her as he misses having Pam as his receptionist, but she is able to earn his respect by cheering him up after his disastrous school visit in \\"Scott's Tots.\\" Unlike her predecessor, Erin loves working as a receptionist, admires Michael and cheerfully accommodates many of his unusual requests (such as serving him a plate of ants on a log every day at 2:30 and spinning him in his chair until he's dizzy) that Pam likely would have been apprehensive about. Although he generally enjoys Erin's thoughtful treatment, his dismissive feelings towards Erin continue until \\"Secretary's Day\\" when he reluctantly agrees to take her out to lunch. Erin relishes the opportunity to spend time with her boss while Michael finds their conversation awkward and mentions that her then-boyfriend Andy Bernard was previously engaged to Angela Martin of which Erin was previously unaware, she is upset to learn this and ends her relationship with Andy. Later that day, Michael apologizes to Erin; the two are finally able to relate to each other over their mutual fondness for silly humor, stemming from their similar immature tendencies (with Michael's ignorance and Erin's naïveté). Their working relationship then develops smoothly while they bond by making each other laugh with childish jokes, such as Erin pointing out that the phrase \\"it's not\\" sounds like \\"snot.\\" In \\"Viewing Party\\", Erin throws a Glee party with her new boyfriend, Gabe Lewis. Throughout the night, she unsuccessfully attempts to get Michael and Gabe to bond. Michael is jealous that the office looks to Gabe as the boss and attempts to sabotage the party. After being confronted by Erin in private, Michael questions why his opinion matters so much to her as he is not her father. In a moment of insight, Michael realizes that Erin, who was raised in foster care, does indeed look to him as a father figure and he instigates a playful fight as father and daughter by saying \\"go to your room, young lady!\\" Erin becomes protective of Michael to the point where she is hostile towards Holly Flax, saying in a talking head interview that she doesn't understand what Michael sees in her, until The Search when she, Dwight and Holly go searching for a missing Michael. Erin sees that Holly is able to sense where Michael is, and when she sees them reconcile, she finally understands their love for each other and smiles. Later in \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Erin talks to Michael about her love life and wishes that she knew her birth mother so she could tell Erin what to do. Michael advises Erin that she shouldn't rush things and that she'll know what to do when the right guy comes along. Michael then tells her that she won't need her mother for advice, because she will always have his personal phone number when she needs advice and kisses her on the head. =Holly Flax= Shortly after the dissolution of his troubled relationship with Jan, Michael found love with Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), Toby's replacement as HR Representative, who appears for a while to be Michael's best chance at love, with the two sharing a similar sense of humor and social awkwardness. However, after David Wallace witnesses them kissing, Holly is transferred to the Nashua branch and she and Michael break up after choosing not to pursue a long-distance relationship. Despite the breakup and Holly's new relationship with another man, their affection for each other doesn't go away, as it's shown that Holly had been writing a note for Michael on her work computer, as well as their subtle romantic glances at one another during the summer company picnic. Throughout her absence in Season 5 (excluding Company Picnic) and carrying on into Season 7, Michael hooks up with a few other women, but ultimately he realizes that they're nothing compared to her. Around Christmas in Season 7, Toby is forced to leave the office due to being selected as part of the jury duty for a local murder case, resulting in Holly returning as the temporary HR replacement. There is initial tension between the two of them and hesitation on her side (mostly after her sudden break-up with A.J.), but Holly finally reunites with Michael after realizing they're both soulmates. The two continue dating for a few weeks, and on Valentine's Day, they tell each other they love each other, decide to move in together, and resolve that they will not allow Dunder Mifflin to interfere with their future together. With her time at the Scranton branch almost up and the recent knowledge that her aging parents need to be taken care of, they ultimately become engaged. Holly later moves back to Colorado and Michael follows her soon after. In the finale it is revealed that they have children together. It was revealed in a photo album on NBC that they have three children and are expecting their fourth child. =Other romantic relationships= Michael's longest relationship before his marriage was with Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), his original-then-former boss from Corporate. Starting with a one-night stand after they closed their business deal at Chili's in \\"The Client\\", Michael and Jan begin awkwardly dating, become an official couple, and eventually move in together after Jan is fired from her job—although Jan usually treated Michael with contempt. After Michael fails to defend Jan in her wrongful dismissal suit against Dunder Mifflin, they remain together for a short while, but end up blowing up at each other during an ill- fated dinner party and eventually break up. He also dated Carol (played by Carell's wife Nancy Walls), a real estate agent from whom Michael bought his condominium. Michael was much more interested in Carol than she was in him, and after he made an unwanted and rejected impromptu public marriage proposal, Michael's decision to Photoshop pictures of himself over Carol's ex-husband in her family pictures resulted in their breakup. On a business trip to Winnipeg, Michael and \\"Concierge Marie\\" become close, and Michael does not wish to leave her after they are caught necking in her suite. After Jim and Pam's wedding, Michael begins dating Pam's mother Helene (much to Pam's horror), but he breaks up with her on her birthday after discovering she is turning 58. Near the end of season six, Michael begins dating Donna (Amy Pietz), the manager of a local bar, but later finds out that she's married and he is, as he puts it, \\"the mistress\\". He continues seeing her until the disgust of his employees drives him to listen to his conscience and break things off with her. In Season 7's \\"Sex Ed\\", Michael reunites (in person or by telephone) with all of his aforementioned past girlfriends when he believes that he has contracted herpes. In doing so, he realizes that Holly was the only one he truly loved.  Legacy of \\"That's What She Said\\"  The show often uses the joke \\"that's what she said\\", which was popularized by the Wayne's World sketch on Saturday Night Live. In the original BBC version of The Office, Ricky Gervais's character David Brent frequently used the similar phrase \\"as the actress said to the bishop\\" as an inappropriate joke. Michael inserts the phrase as a sexually suggestive double entendre even in the most inappropriate circumstances, including business meetings and legal depositions. Michael finds uttering the phrase so irresistible that in \\"Sexual Harassment\\" he is goaded into saying it just seconds after Jan Levinson and a lawyer from Corporate specifically ask him not to do so. The phrase has become so associated with the character that the television show 30 Rock in the episode \\"TGS Hates Women\\", there was a scene in which Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) becomes infuriated at another character's use of the catchphrase, exclaiming, \\"Steve Carell owns 'That's What She Said,' okay? He owns it!\\" In the episode \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", \\"that's what she said\\" was Steve Carell's final (inaudible) line as a series regular, and was his first line upon returning as a guest star in \\"Finale\\". Comparison with David Brent Although originally based on David Brent, Scott developed into a significantly different character than his British counterpart. Whereas Brent is shown to be irredeemably incompetent, Scott is portrayed as an outstanding salesman who is unwisely promoted to a management role to which he appears completely ill-suited. (In a scathing performance review during episode eight of season two, Jan Levinson suggests that Scott should be removed from his management role and return to sales.) Scott is thus an apt example of the Peter Principle which states that competent persons in a hierarchical organization will \\"rise to the level of their incompetence\\" after which they will not advance. Despite his failings, Scott has been oddly successful as regional manager. This is attributed, in part, to his weakness of procrastination wherein he typically forfeits a bad choice by seeking the advice of his more competent subordinates (such as Jim, Oscar, or Darryl) and uses their recommendations. Scott's success is also partly attributed to his main strength: genuinely caring about the well-being of the office and treating his employees like family. When he took over the Scranton Branch he decreased costs by 17%, without firing any personnel. After the merger of the two branches Scott does not lose a single client despite a great deal of employee turnover (much of which he was directly responsible for). He received a $3,000 bonus for firing Devon, most likely because his doing so saved the company around $50,000. Although it is suggested that Brent has had similar success, such claims only ever come from Brent himself, thus making them unreliable. Scott's social immaturity and inability to cope with responsibility is balanced with a personality that is much more caring than Brent's, even if both make unwise comments in the heat of the moment. Unlike Brent, who pretends to be friendly with many of his employees purely for the benefit of the cameras, Scott seems to genuinely like his colleagues, with the exception of Human Resources Director Toby Flenderson. Scott's need to be liked by his staff and his belief that people see him as a genuine friend leads him to become very hurt when he realizes this is not the case. Most, if not all, of Scott's managerial blunders can be directly correlated with the degree to which he desires to be liked by his employees or jealously seeks their approval. The DVD commentary to the pilot episode suggests that Scott's character continues a process begun in the second UK series, in which Gervais and Merchant intentionally made Brent less nasty, and more of a buffoon. It is said in the commentary that Gervais and Merchant suggested that this be applied to Scott. This also reflects a general change in the US version's attitude, which is more sympathetic to the characters, and tones down the cruel humor of the original. The commentary also says that Steve Carell had not seen more than a few minutes of the original UK series when he was offered the role of Scott, and has since made a conscious decision not to watch it in case it influences his own performance. During an interview on Marc Maron's podcast, Jenna Fischer said that, when initially developing the show, Gervais explained that it is much more common in the UK for people to spend many years working at jobs that they dislike or are unfit for than it is in the US, which is why Michael Scott is portrayed as being significantly more successful in the workplace than was Brent. The show's writers have said that the 2005 hit movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin provided very useful guidance as they refined the character along with Steve Carell between the first and second seasons. Michael Scott wore a large amount of hair gel and dressed sloppily in Season 1, but by Season 2 he had a more conventional haircut and dressed much more neatly. Also, while Michael is often rude and nasty in Season 1, he is generally nicer and less hard-edged in subsequent seasons. In the seventh- season episode \\"The Seminar\\", Michael in fact briefly meets David Brent in the lobby and they establish an immediate rapport, joking together and generally signalling that they would have been good friends. Behind the scenes * U.S. Developer Greg Daniels envisioned Michael Scott behaving as if \\"I was hoping that the documentary about this would one day be seen by Jennifer Aniston, and I was just trying to impress her any way I possibly could.\\" On the audio commentary for \\"Valentine's Day\\", Daniels notes that he included a meeting between Michael and two other branch managers in order to contrast Michael's level of competence with theirs: while Michael is not as dynamic as Josh Porter who would later be hired in a senior management position at Staples, his management skills are superior to those of the hopelessly inept Craig and could be regarded as an adequate but unexceptional branch manager who is, despite his antics, just competent enough to avoid being fired.Daniels, Greg (Producer). 2005. \\"Valentine's Day\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. * Writer B.

Throughout his career, Todd was a professor at the University of Nottingham and the University of Exeter, and Principal of Trevelyan College, Durham. He specialized in the archaeology of Roman Britain and the Germanic peoples in the Migration Period, on which the was the author of numerous influential works. Early life and education Malcolm Todd was born in Durham, England on 27 November 1939, the son of Wilfrid Todd and Rose Evelyn Johnson. Durham was at the time a characteristic mining and farming community, and his father was a miner. Todd went to grammar school in Hartlepool. Encouraged by his father, who did not want his son to become a miner, Todd received his BA and BLitt in classics from St David's College, Lampeter, and a diploma in classical archaeology from Brasenose College, Oxford in 1963. Among his teachers at Oxford were Ian Richmond. Early career During his studies, Todd became strongly interested in the archaeology of the Rhine provinces of the Roman Empire, and from 1963 to 1965 he worked as a research assistant at Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn under . Since 1965, Todd was Lecturer (1965-1974), Senior Lecturer (1974-1977) and Reader (1977-1979) in Archaeology at the University of Nottingham. While at Nottingham, Todd carried out excavations at Ancaster, Margidunum and medieval Newark-on-Trent. Todd became a Corresponding Member of the German Archaeological Institute in 1977. Todd was Visiting Professor at New York University in 1979. Career at the University of Exeter Ramparts inside the hillfort at Hembury, where Todd conducted pioneering archaeological excavations. In 1979, Todd was appointed Professor of Archaeology at the University of Exeter. He was the first archaeologist appointed a professor at Exeter since the teaching of archaeology had been established there some years earlier under Aileen Fox. While at Exeter, Todd specialized in the archaeology of the late Roman Empire and the Migration Period, urbanism in early Europe, and relations between the Roman Empire and \\"barbarians\\". It was while at Exeter that Todd carried out his most important archaeological fieldwork. At Hembury, Todd uncovered a previously unrecognized Roman occupation of the Iron Age hillfort. At Bury Barton he identified two Roman sites, including a fort. He also researched Roman mining of lead in the Mendips. At Charterhouse-on- Mendip, Todd found evidence of Roman galena ore extraction. Combined with his duties at Exeter, Todd played an active role in the scholarly community. He was a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford in 1984. Todd was Editor of Britannia for five years, and was later Chairman of its Editorial Committee, which also oversees the publishing of the Journal of Roman Studies. He was Vice-President of the Roman Society from 1985 until his death. He was on the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England from 1986 to 1992, and on the Council of the National Trust from 1987 to 1991. From 1990 to 1991 he was Visiting Fellow at Brasenose College, Oxford and a Senior Research Fellow at the British Academy. He was Trustee of the Roman Research Trust from 1994 to 1999. Todd was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Career at Trevelyan College In 1996, Todd returned to his hometown to become Principal of Trevelyan College, Durham. He simultaneously held a part-time post tasked with extending the Department of Archaeology. During this time he was also an archaeological consultant to Durham Cathedral. Under the leadership of Todd, great changes were made to the management structure of Trevelyan, new fellowships, scholarships and awards were introduced, and its buildings were significantly renovated. Retirement, death and legacy Map of tribal movements of the Migration Period. Todd was recognized as one the world's leading experts on the archaeology of the period. Todd had little patience with administrative work, and had an ambivalent view on the digitization of academia. As he result he took an early retirment from Trevelyan in 2000, which enabled him to focus entirely on writing and research. He subsequently returned to Exeter, where he continued to own a house. During this time he edited and published Companion to Roman Britain (2004), which is considered an essential work. He also published the results of his excavations at Charterhouse-on-Mendip. Todd died of a heart attack on 6 June 2013, and was survived by his wife and two children. Throughout his career, Todd was the author of numerous books and scholarly articles, and also wrote entries for works such as Encyclopædia Britannica, Cambridge Ancient History and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. His bibliography includes three books about the Germanic peoples, for which he received wide renown. Several of these were translated into multiple languages, such as French, German and Italian. Todd was considered one of the foremost authorities on the archaeology of Germanic peoples living on the Roman border. His books also covered a wide array of topics related to the Roman Empire, including the Aurelian Walls, Roman currency, populated places of Britain, Romano-British tribes, and the end of Roman rule in Britain. His research and works on the archaeology of Roman Britain and the Germanic peoples remain highly influential. Personal life Todd married Molly Tanner on 2 September 1964, with whom he had a daughter and a son.

It was shown in August 2004 and made the name of Francis Fulford and his family when it was aired as part of the United Kingdom's Channel 4 TV series Cutting Edge.  Background and location  Francis, known to his friends as \\"Fker\\" Fulford, is the 24th in his family to have inherited Great Fulford, an 800-year old crumbling manor house on a estate in Dunsford, near Cheriton Bishop, Devon.  Synopsis  With their mansion becoming increasingly dilapidated and the family in financial difficulty, Francis Fulford concocts several elaborate schemes to make money. The schemes include using a metal detector to search the family's 3000-acre estate for treasure, searching for telephone cables so that he can invoice British Telecom, selling guided tours of the mansion, conjuring up stories of ghosts and harvesting trees. Meanwhile, his wife Kishanda tries to solve the family's financial difficulties by gambling on horse races. Oblivious to the family's turmoil, the four Fulford children entertain themselves by fighting, indoor cricket, throwing mud at each other or watching television. At one point in the episode, Kishanda becomes so angry with her children, she picks up the television set carries it outside and throws it into a lake. Throughout the programme, Francis expresses frequent outbursts of profanity. Of the show's 53 swearwords, 38 of them are uttered by Francis.  Reception  The show was a hit with both viewers and critics. Upon airing on Channel 4, 3.5 million viewers tuned in giving Channel Four a 17% audience share. The programme was nominated for a BAFTA, in the 'Best Single Documentary' category, in the 2005 awards year. It also featured in Channel Five's '100 most swearing TV shows' and came 7th with 24 swear words – mostly beginning with F – in the first 26 minutes. It was largely this issue – how the use of profane language divided individual strata within the British class system – that marked it out from any other programme or documentary in a similar vein.  Follow up programmes  In a later programme entitled Why Britain's F, he raised further points about the decline of a sense of duty, a lack of responsibility and basic knowledge of the United Kingdom's history. Francis and the four Fulford children returned to television, without the presence their wife and mother Kishanda, in the six-part series Life Is Toff, broadcast on BBC Three in autumn 2014.Jodelka, Filipa Life Is Toff: the Fulfords are back The Guardian, 25 October 2014  References   External links  * Great Fulford website Category:Channel 4 original programming Category:2004 television specials Category:British television specials ","title":"The F*ing Fulfords"},{"id":"3389065","text":"Superman/Aliens is an American comic book limited series about a battle between the superhero Superman and the aliens created by H. R. Giger (a.k.a. the Xenomorphs), from the Alien film series. The writers use the plot device of Superman's powers temporarily diminishing-due to him being in a location with a distinct lack of yellow sunlight that his body requires to give him his powers-to make the Xenomorphs a believable threat to the Man of Steel.http://io9.com/5849075/the-10-most-deranged-alien-crossover-stories Creative team on this miniseries: story and layout art by Dan Jurgens, with finished art by Kevin Nowlan. It was published by Dark Horse Comics in unison with DC Comics from July 1995-September 1995. Plot Accompanying Doctor Cheryl Kimble—the head of Lexcorp's space division—on the investigation of an incoming probe as part of Lexcorp's attempts to improve its public image, Clark is shocked to discover that the pod's transmissions are a Kryptonian distress call. Making contact with the pod, Superman receives a telepathic transmission of a city that survived the destruction of its planet and is now running out of resources. Taking a ship to investigate the city—which is located far from any sun, causing his powers to fade the longer he remains—Superman discovers a small group of unconscious survivors and sends them back to the Lexcorp satellite in his ship. Further exploration puts him against an Alien, but his depleted powers allow the creature to wound him before he is rescued by Kara, another survivor of the city, who explains that the Aliens came from an abandoned freighter containing an Alien Queen that crashed on Argo years ago. Back on the Lexcorp satellite, the chestbursters (immature Xenomorphs) hatch from the hosts that Superman sent back, leaving Doctor Kimble determined to capture and analyse them while Lois Lane is forced to face an Alien in the hangar, only just managing to force the Alien into space by opening the airlock while she hides in the ship. As Kimble witnesses two of the remaining chestbursters \\"hatch,\\" Lois torches the infants with a spray can and a match, but she and Kimble are forced together to escape the last, full-grown Alien as it begins to tear the satellite apart. As Superman and Kara attempt to escape, both of them are captured and \\"impregnated\\" with embryos, but this gives them an advantage; since Superman's embryo is that of an Alien Queen, the Aliens will not risk harming him. As they escape, Superman learns that Kara is not from Krypton, but from Odiline, the planet where The Cleric—-the being who originally gave Superman the Eradicator-—laid the bodies of his Kryptonian followers to rest after their demise, with Odiline growing to revere Kryptonians as their spiritual protectors, adopting much of their customs and language. Reaching the freighter that brought the Aliens to Argo originally, the two discover escape pods and transporter booths, but the pods launch mechanisms are jammed; the only way to launch them is to destroy the ship. While Superman preps the coordinates, Kara sets the core to overload before returning to a transporter booth; unfortunately, crucial seconds are lost when Superman uses the booth to teleport the embryo out of her, with Kara being forced out of the booth by an Alien attack moments before the ship is destroyed and the pod launched. Arriving back in Earth's solar system, Superman's powers are restored just in time to stop the chestburster from emerging, allowing him to \\"crush\\" it and regurgitate out of his system before catching the falling satellite, Kimble subsequently killing the last Alien. As Superman departs, however, he is left mourning the loss of Kara-—the closest thing to a sister he might ever know—unaware that she made it to a pod before Argo's destruction and remains lost in space. Superman/Aliens 2: God War In 2002, a sequel was published called Superman/Aliens 2: God War. It was written by Chuck Dixon, with art by Jon Bogdanove and Kevin Nowlan. =Plot= In this sequel, Darkseid acquires several Alien eggs, subsequently sending them to New Genesis within several Parademons and unleashing them on his foes, with an embryo even infesting Orion. Learning that he will die from the embryo within him, Orion accompanies Superman on a mission to Apokolips to destroy the Alien Queen, despite the lack of sunlight on Apokolips weakening Superman's powers and Orion growing ever weaker from the embryo within him. Despite the odds, they manage to destroy the Queen. Darkseid subsequently uses his Omega Beams to destroy the embryo within Orion, claiming that Orion may be Darkseid's enemy, but he is also his son and it would be unfitting for him to die in such a dishonorable manner. After Superman and Orion's departure, however, Darkseid reveals to DeSaad that, actually, Orion being infested was the central focus of his plan; with Orion having been given some evidence that Darkseid may still think of him as a son, his loyalties to New Genesis may become divided at some crucial future date. As the comic ends, Darkseid and DeSaad look in at a room filled with facehugger-infected Parademons in stasis, hinting at a possible sequel.

Shapes are simple and bold, with tea bowls the most typical. The emphasis is on the ceramic glaze, where a number of distinct effects can be produced, some including an element of randomness that has a philosophical appeal to the Japanese. The tea-masters who developed the Japanese tea ceremony promoted the aesthetic underlying tenmoku pottery.  History  Chinese Jian ware yohen tenmoku tea bowl with blue and green \\"oil spot\\" marks, southern Song dynasty, 13th century. National Treasure (Japan) Tenmoku takes its name from the Tianmu Mountain (天目Mandarin: tiān mù; ; ) temple in China where iron-glazed bowls were used for tea. The style became widely popular during the Song dynasty. In Chinese it is called Jian Zhan (建盏), which means \\"Jian (tea)cup\\". According to chronicles in 1406, the Yongle Emperor (1360–1424) of the Ming dynasty sent ten Jian ware bowls to the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358-1408), who ruled during the Muromachi period. A number of Japanese monks who traveled to monasteries in China also brought pieces back home. As they became valued for tea ceremonies, more pieces were imported from China where they became highly prized goods. Three of these vessels from the southern Song dynasty are so highly valued that they were included by the government in the list of National Treasures of Japan (crafts: others). The style was eventually produced in Japan as well, where it endures until this day. The Japanese term gradually replaced the original Chinese one for general ware of the type. Of particular renown were the kilns that produced tenmoku are Seto ware. The glaze is still produced in Japan amongst a very small circle of artists, one being Kamada Kōji (鎌田幸二). Others are Nagae Sōkichi (長江惣吉), Hayashi Kyōsuke (林恭助), and Oketani Yasushi (桶谷寧). Japanese artists have been helping in successfully re-introducing the technique back in China.  Characteristics  Contemporary chawan bowl with brownish tenmoku glaze Contemporary sake cup with blue tenmoku glaze, by Kamada Kōji It is made of feldspar, limestone, and iron oxide. The more quickly a piece is cooled, the blacker the glaze will be. Tenmokus are known for their variability. During their heating and cooling, several factors influence the formation of iron crystals within the glaze. A long firing process and a clay body which is also heavily colored with iron increase the opportunity for iron from the clay to be drawn into the glaze. While the glaze is molten, iron can migrate within the glaze to form surface crystals, as in the \\"oil spot\\" glaze, or remain in solution deeper within the glaze for a rich glossy color. Oil spots are more common in an oxidation firing.Ceramics Monthly, \\"Oil Spot and Hare’s Fur Glazes: Demystifying Classic Ceramic Glazes\\", John Britt, April 13, 2011. A longer cooling time allows for maximum surface crystals. Potters can \\"fire down\\" a kiln to help achieve this effect. During a normal firing, the kiln is slowly brought to a maximum temperature by adding fuel, then fueling is stopped and the kiln is allowed to cool slowly by losing heat to the air around it. To fire down a kiln, the potter continues to add a limited amount of fuel after the maximum temperature is reached to slow the cooling process and keep the glazes molten for as long as possible. Tenmoku glazes can range in color from dark plum (persimmon), to yellow, to brown, to black.

Wood carving is one of the oldest arts of humankind. Wooden spears from the Middle Paleolithic, such as the Clacton Spear, reveal how humans have engaged in utilitarian woodwork for millennia. Indeed, the beginnings of the craft go so far back that, at least where timber is present, the use of wood exists as a universal in human culture as both a means to create or enhance technology and as a medium for artistry. The North American Indian carves his wooden fish- hook or his pipe stem just as the Polynesian works patterns on his paddle. The native of Guyana decorates his cassava grater with a well-conceived scheme of incised scrolls, while the native of Loango Bay distorts his spoon with a design of figures standing up in full relief carrying a hammock. Wood carving is also present in architecture. Figure-work seems to have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be not only more difficult but also less satisfactory than sculpting with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the grain of the wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color. It is not always realized at the present day to what extent color has even from the most ancient times been used to enhance the effect of wood-carving and sculpture. The modern colour prejudice against gold and other tints is perhaps because painted work has been vulgarized. The arrangement of a proper and harmonious scheme of colour is not the work of the house painter, but of the specially trained artist. In the early 20th century, the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, on which much of this entry is based, commented, \\"Of late years carving has gone out of fashion. The work is necessarily slow and requires substantial skill, making the works expensive. Other and cheaper methods of decoration have driven carving from its former place. Machine work has much to answer for, and the endeavor to popularize the craft by means of the village class has not always achieved its own end. The gradual disappearance of the individual artist, elbowed out as he has been, by the contractor, is fatal to the continuance of an art which can never flourish when done at so much a yard.\\" This statement has proven untrue, as the continued survival of the art and craft of woodcarving can be demonstrated by the large number of woodcarvers who have carried on or advanced the tradition in different parts of the world.  Ancient Egypt  Ancient Egyptian servant statuettes The extreme dryness of the climate of Egypt accounts for the existence of a number of woodcarvings from this remote period. Some wood panels from the tomb of Hosul Egypt, at Sakkarah are of the III. dynasty. The carving consists of Egyptian hieroglyphs and figures in low relief, and the style is extremely delicate and fine. A stool shown on one of the panels has the legs shaped like the fore and hind limbs of an animal, a form common in Egypt for thousands of years. In the Cairo museum may be seen the statue of a man from the period of the Great Pyramid of Giza, possibly 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of this or any other period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent rock crystal forms the iris, while a tiny bit of polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The IV., V. and VI. dynasties cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification (Maspero). As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these Ka statues, the features and proportions were closely copied. There are to be found in the principal museums of Europe many Egyptian examples: mummy cases of human beings with the face alone carved, animal mummy cases, sometimes boxes, with the figure of a lizard, perhaps, carved in full Mummy relief standing on the lid. Sometimes the animal would be carved in the round and its hollowed body used as the case itself. Of furniture, folding seats like the modern camp stool, and chairs with legs terminating in the heads of beasts or the feet of animals, Furniture still exist. Beds supported by lions paws XI. and XII. dynasties, from Gebelein, now in the Cairo Museum), headrests, 6 or 8 in. high, shaped like a crutch on a foot, very like those used by the native of New Guinea today, are carved with scenes, etc., in outline. In the British Museum may be seen a tiny little coffer, 4 in. by 21/2 in., with very delicate figures carved in low relief. This little box stands on cabriole legs 3/4 of an inch long with claw feet, quite Louis Quinze in character. There are incense ladles, the handle representing a bouquet of lotus flowers, the bowl formed like the leaf of an aquatic plant with serrated edges from Gurnah during the XVIII. dynasty; mirror handles, representing a little pillar, or a lotus stalk, sometimes surmounted by a head of Hathor, the Egyptian Venus or of Bes, god of the toilet; pin-cushions, in the shape of a small round tortoise with holes in the back for toilet pins, which were also of wood with dog-head ends (XI. dynasty, Cairo Museum); and perfume boxes such as a fish, the two halves forming the bottom and top of the perfume or pomatum was removed by little wooden spoons, one shaped in the form of a cartouche emerging from a full-blown lotus, another shaped like the neck of a goose, a third consisting of a dog running with a fish in its closed mouth, the fish forming the bowl. The list might be prolonged, but enough has been said to show to what a pitch of refinement the art of wood-carving had reached thousands of years before the birth of Christ. Of the work of Assyria, Greece and Rome, little is actually known except from history or inference. It may be safely assumed that the Assyrian craft kept pace with the varying taste and refinement of Greece and all the older civilizations. Important pieces of wooden Roman sculpture which once existed in Greece and other ancient countries are only known to us from the descriptions of Pausanias and other classic writers. Many examples of the wooden images of the gods, were preserved down to late historic times. The Palladium, or sacred figure of Pallas, which was guarded by the Vestal Virgins in Rome and was fabled to have been brought by Aeneas from the burning Troy, was one of these wooden figures.  Western World / Europe  Great works of art were created in wood during the entire Middle Ages, e.g. in Cathedrals, Abbeys and other Church connected sites. These works demonstrated both craftsmanship and artistry. =First eleven centuries of CE= St Sabina on the Aventine Hill, dating back from the 5th century Wood-carving examples of the first eleven centuries of CE are rare due to the fact that woods do decay easily in 1,000 years. The carved panels of the main doors of St Sabina on the Aventine Hill, Rome, are very interesting specimens of early Christian relief sculpture in wood, dating, as the dresses show, from the 5th century. The doors are made up of a large number of small square panels, each minutely carved with a scene from the Old or New Testament. A very fine fragment of Byzantine art (11th or 12th centuries) is preserved in a monastery at Mount Athos in Macedonia. It consists of two panels (one above the other) of relief sculpture, surmounted by a semicircular arch of conventional foliage springing from columns ornamented with animals in foliage of spiral form. The capitals and bases are square, each face being carved with a figure. It is a wonderfully fine piece of work, conceived in the best decorative spirit. In Scandinavian countries we find some very early work of excellent design, both Christian and Non-Christian in nature, as \\"The Christening\\" in that part of the world took place quite late in the first millennium CE. In the Christiania Museum there are some fine chairs. In the Copenhagen Museum there are panels from Iceland in the same style. The celebrated wooden doorways of Aal (1200 CE), Sauland, Flaa, Solder and other Norwegian churches (Christiania Museum) has dragons and intricate scroll work, a style which we still see carried on in the door-posts of the 15th century in the Nordiska museum, Stockholm, and in the Icelandic work of quite modern times. In these early days the leaf was not much developed in design. The carver depended almost entirely on the stalk, a style of work which has its counterpart in Burmese work of the 17th century. = Gothic period (12th–15th centuries) = Towards the end of this epoch wood-carving reached its culminating point. The choir stalls, rood- screens, roofs, retables, of England, France and the Teutonic countries of Europe, have in execution, balance and proportion, never at any time been approached. In small designs, in detail, in minuteness, in mechanical accuracy, the carver of this time has had his rivals, but for greatness of architectural conception, for a just appreciation of decorative treatment, the designer of the 15th century stands alone. Gothic beauty in carved wood It should always be borne in mind that color was the keynote of this scheme. The custom was practically universal, and enough traces remain to show how splendid was the effect of these old Gothic churches and cathedrals. The priests in their gorgeous vestments, the lights, the crucifix, the banners and incense, the frescoed or diapered walls, and that crowning glory of Gothic art, the stained glass, were all in harmony with these beautiful schemes of colored carved work. Red, blue, green, white and gilding were the tints as a rule used. Not only were the screens painted in colors, but the parts painted white were often further decorated with delicate lines and sprigs of foliage in conventional pattern. The plain surfaces of the panels were also adorned with saints, often on a background of delicate gesso diaper, colored or gilded (Southwold). Nothing could exceed the beauty of the triptychs or retables of Germany, Flanders or France; carved with scenes from the New Testament in high relief arranged under a delicate lacework of canopies and clustered pinnacles glistening with gold and brilliant colors. In Germany the effect was further enhanced by emphasizing parts of the gilding by means of a transparent varnish tinted with red or green, thus giving a special tone to the metallic luster. The style of design used during this great period owes much of its interest to the now obsolete custom of directly employing the craftsman and his men, instead of the present-day habit of giving the work to a contractor. It is easy to trace how those bands of carvers traveled about from church to church. In one district the designer would employ a particular form and arrangement of vine leaf, while in another adjoining quite a different style repeatedly appears. The general scheme was of course planned by one mastermind, but the carrying out of each section, each part, each detail, was left to the individual workman. Hence that variety of treatment, that endless diversity, which gives a charm and interest to Gothic art, unknown in more symmetrical epochs. The Gothic craftsman appreciated the cardinal fact that in design beautiful detail does not necessarily ensure a beautiful composition, and subordinated the individual part to the general effect. He also often carved in situ, a practice seldom if ever followed in the present day. Here and there one comes across the work of long years ago still unfinished. A half-completed bench-end, a fragment of screen left plain, clearly show that sometimes at least the church was the workshop. = Gothic and Renaissance: A comparison = Gothic design roughly divides itself into two classes: #the geometrical, i.e. tracery and diaper patterns, and #the foliage designs, where the mechanical scroll of the Renaissance is as a rule absent. The lines of foliage treatment, so common in the bands of the 15th-century roodscreens and the panel work especially of Germany, serve to illustrate the widely different motives of the craftsmen of these two great epochs. Again, while the Renaissance designer as a rule made the two sides of the panel alike, the Gothic carver seldom repeated a single detail. While his main lines and grouping corresponded, his detail differed. Of numberless examples a 15th- century chest (Plate III. fig. 6) in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin may be referred to. The arrangements of foliage, etc., on top, back and front, are typical of Gothic at its best. = End of the 12th century = As this section treats of woodcarving in Europe generally, and not of any one country alone, the dates just named must be of necessity only approximate. The 13th century was marked not only by great skill both in design and treatment, but also much devotional feeling. The craftsman seems to have not merely carved, but to have carved to the glory of God. At no time was work more delicately conceived or more beautifully cut. This early Gothic style certainly lent itself to fine finish, and in this respect was more suited to stone treatment than to wood. But the loving care bestowed on each detail seems to point to a religious devotion which is sometimes absent from later work. Very good examples of capitals (now, alas, divided down the center) are to be seen in Peterborough cathedral. Scrolls and foliage spring from groups of columns of four. Some Italian columns of the same date (Victoria and Albert Museum) should be compared, much to the advantage of the former. Exeter Cathedral boasts misericords unsurpassed for skilful workmanship; mermaids, dragons, elephants, masks, knights and other subjects introduced into foliage, form the designs. Salisbury cathedral is noted for its stall elbows, and the reredos in the south transept of Adisham, Kent, is another fine example testifying to the great skill of the 13th-century woodcarvers. A very interesting set of stalls, the early history of which is unknown, was placed in Barming church, Kent, about the year 1868. The book rest ends are carved with two scrolls and an animal standing between, and the ends of the stalls with figure sculpture: = 1300–1380 = During this period foliage forms, though still conventional, more closely followed nature. The canopy work of the choir of Winchester contains exquisite carvings of oak and other leaves. The choir stalls of Ely and Chichester and the tomb of Edward III. in Westminster Abbey are all fine examples of this period. Exeter boasts a throne that of Bishop Stapledon (1308–1326) standing high, which remains unequaled for perfection of proportion and delicacy of detail. In France the stalls of St Benoit-sur- Loire, Lisieux, and Évreux are good 14th-century examples. But little Gothic work is now to be seen in the churches of this country. It is to the museums we have to look for traces of the old Gothic carvers. The two retables in Dijon Museum, the work of Jacques de Baerze (1301), a sculptor of Flanders, who carved for Philippe le Hardi, Duke of Burgundy, are masterpieces of design and workmanship. The tracery is of the very finest, chiefly gilt on backgrounds of diapered gesso. = 1380–1520 = Towards the end of the 14th century carvers gave up natural foliage treatment to a great extent, and took to more conventional forms. The oak and the maple no longer inspired the designer, but the vine was constantly employed. A very large amount of 15th- century work remains to us, but the briefest reference only can be made to some of the more beautiful examples that help to make this period so great. The rood screen, that wonderful feature of the medieval church, was now universal. It consisted of a tall screen of usually about thirty ft. high, on the top of which rested a loft, i.e. a platform rood about . in width guarded on either side by a gallery screen, and either on the top or in front of that, facing the nave, was placed the rood, i.e. a large crucifix with figures of St Mary and St John on either side. This rood screen sometimes spanned the church in one continuous length (Leeds, Kent), but often filled in the aisle and chancel arches in three separate divisions (Church Handborough, Oxon.). The loft was as a rule approached by a winding stair built in the thickness of the aisle wall. The lower part of the screen itself was solid paneled to a height of about and the upper part of this paneling was filled in with tracery (Carbrook, Norfolk), while the remaining flat surfaces of the panels were often pictured with saints on a background of delicate gesso diaper (Southwold, Suffolk). Towards the end of this period the employment of figures became less common as a means of decoration, and the panels were sometimes filled- entirely with carved foliage (Swimbridge, Devon). The upper part of the rood screen consisted of open arches with the heads filled in with pierced tracery, often enriched with crockets (Seaming, Norfolk), embattled transoms (Hedingham Castle, Essex), or floriated cusps (Eye, Suffolk). The mullions were constantly carved with foliage (Cheddar, Somerset), pinnacles (Causton, Norfolk), angels (Pilton, Devon), or decorated with canopy work in gesso (Southwold). But the feature of these beautiful screens was the loft with its gallery and vaulting. The loft floor rested on the top of the rood screen and was usually balanced and kept in position by means of a groined vaulting (Harberton, Devon) or a cove (Eddington, Somerset). The finest examples of vaulting are to be seen in Devon. The bosses at the intersections of the ribs and the carved tracery of the screen at Honiton stand unrivaled. Many screens still possess the beam which formed the edge of the loft floor and on which the gallery rested. It was here that the medieval roodscreen carver gave most play to his fancy, and carved the finest designs in foliage to be seen throughout the whole Gothic period. Although these massed moulds, crests and bands have the appearance of being carved out of one log, they were in practice invariably built up in parts, much of the foliage, etc., being pierced and placed in hollow moulds in order to increase the shadow. As a rule the arrangement consisted of a crest running along the top, with a smaller one depending from the lower edge, and three bands of foliage and vine between them (Feniton, Devon). The designs of vine leaves at Kenton, Bow and Dartmouth, all in Devon, illustrate three very beautiful treatments of this plant. At Swimbridge, Devon, there is a very elaborate combination; the usual plain beads which separate the bands are carved with twisted foliage also. At Abbots Kerswell and other places in the district round Totnes the carvers introduced birds in the foliage with the best effect. The variety of cresting used is very great. That at Winchcomb, Gloucester, consists of dragons combined with vine leaves and foliage. It illustrates how Gothic carvers sometimes repeated their patterns in as mechanical a way as the worst workmen of the present time. Little can be said of the galleries, so few remain to us. They were nearly all pulled down when the order to destroy the roods was issued in 1548. That they were decorated with carved saints under niches (Llananno, Wales), or painted figures (Strencham, Worcester), is certain from the examples that have survived the Reformation. At Atherington. Devon, the gallery front is decorated with the royal coat of arms, other heraldic devices, and with prayers. The Breton screen at St Fiacre-le-Faouet is a wonderful example of French work of this time, btit does not compare with the best English examples. Its flamboyant lines and its small tracery never obtained any foothold in England, though screens carved in this way (Colebrook, Devon) are sometimes to be found. The rood was sometimes of such dimensions as to require some support in addition to the gallery on which it rested. A carved beam was used from which a chain connected the rood itself. At Cullompton, Devon, such a beam still exists, and is carved with foliage; an open cresting ornaments the under side and two angels support the ends. This particular rood stood on a base of rocks, skulls and bones, carved out of two solid logs averaging 18 in. wide and 21 in. high, and together measuring long; there are round holes along the top which were probably used for lights. No country in Europe possesses roofs to equal those of England created in the 15th century. The great roof of Westminster Hall remains to the present day unique. In Norfolk and Suffolk roofs abound of the hammerbeam class; that at Woolpit, Suffolk, achieves the first rank of quality. Each bracket is carved with strongly designed foliage, the end of every beam terminates in an angel carrying a shield, and the purlins are crested, while each truss is supported by a canopied riche (containing a figure) resting on an angel corbel. Here, too, as at Ipswich and many other churches, there is a row of angels with outspread wings under the wall-plate. This idea of angels in the roof is a very beautiful one, and the effect is much enhanced by the coloring. The roof at St Nicholas, King's Lynn, is a magnificent example of tiebeam construction. The trusses are filled in with tracery at the sides and the centres more or less open, and the beams, which are crested and embattled, contain a row of angels on either side. In Devon, Cullompton possesses a very fine semicircular ceiling supported at intervals by ribs pierced with carving. Each compartment is divided up into small square panels, crossed by diagonal ribs of cresting, while every joint is ornamented with a boss carved in the decorative way peculiar to the Gothic craftsman. The nave roof of Manchester cathedral is nearly flat, and is also divided up into small compartments and bossed; the beams are supported by carved brackets resting on corbels with angels at each base. Choir stalls in the Ulm Münster by Jörg Syrlin t.E. (ca. 1470) Bust of Cicero by Jörg Syrlin t.E., in the Ulm Münster In the 15th century, choir stalls with their canopies continued to increase in magnificence. Manchester cathedral (middle of 15th century) and Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey (early 16th) are good examples of the fashion of massing ~7~7 pinnacles and canopies; a custom which hardly compares with the more simple beauty of the 14th-century work of Ely cathedral. The stalls of Amiens cathedral were perhaps the finest in the world at the beginning of the 16th century. The cresting employed, though common on the Continent, is of a kind hardly known in England, consisting as it does of arches springing from arches, and decorated with crockets and finials. The tabernacle work over the end seats, with its pinnacles and flying buttresses, stretches up towards the roof in tapering lines of the utmost delicacy. The choir stalls (the work of Jörg Syrlin the Elder) in Ulm Minster are among the finest produced by the German carver. The front panels are carved with foliage of splendid decorative boldness, strength and character; the stall ends were carved with foliage and sculpture along the top edge, as was sometimes the case in Bavaria and France as well as Germany. In early times the choir alone possessed seats, the nave being left bare. Gradually benches were introduced, and during the 15th century became universal. The poppyhead form of B ornament now reached perfection and was constantly used enc for seats other than those of the choir. The name refers en a. to the carved finial which is so often used to complete the top of the bench end and is peculiarly English in character. In Devon and Cornwall it is rarely met with (Ilsington, Devon). In Somerset it is more common, while in the eastern counties thousands of examples remain. The quite simple fleur-de-lys form of poppyhead, suitable for the village, is seen in perfection at Trunch, Norfolk, and the very elaborate form when the poppyhead springs from a crocketed circle filled in with sculpture, at St Nicholas, King's Lynn. Often the foliage contained a face (St Margaret's, Cley, Norfolk), or the poppyhead consisted of figures or birds only (Thurston, Suffolk) or a figure standing on a dragon (Great Brincton, Northampton); occasionally the traditional form was departed from and the finial carved like a lemon in outline (Bury St Edmuncis) or a diamond (Tirley, Glos.). In Denmark an ornament in the form of a large circle sometimes takes the place of the English poppy-head. In the Copenhagen Museum there is a set of bench ends of the 15th century with such a decoration carved with coats of arms, interlacing strap-work, etc. But the old 15th-century bench end did not depend entirely on the poppy-head for its embellishment. The side was constantly enriched with elaborate tracery (Dennington, Norfolk) or with tracery and domestic scenes (North Cadbury, Somerset), or would consist of a mass of sculpture in perspective, with canopy work, buttresses and sculptured niches, while the top of the bench end would be crowned with figures carved in the round, of the finest craftsmanship. Such work at Amiens cathedral is a marvel alike of conception, design and execution. In the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin some beautiful stall ends are to be seen. Out of a dragons mouth grows a conventional tree arranged and balanced in excellent proportion. On another, stall end a tree is carved growing out of the mouth of a fool. This custom of making foliage grow out of the mouth or eyes is hardly defensible, and was by no means confined to any country or time. We have plenty of Renaissance examples of the same treatment. Before the 15th century preaching had not become a regular institution in England, and pulpits were not so common. However, the value of the sermon began to be appreciated from the use to which the Lollards and other sects put this method of teaching doctrine, and pulpits became a necessity. A very beautiful one exists at Kenton, Devon. It is, as is generally the case, octagonal, and stands on a foot. Each angle is carved with an upright column of foliage between pinnacles, and the panels, which are painted with saints, are enriched with carved canopies and foliage; it is, however, much restored. The puipit at Trull, Somerset, is noted for its fine figure carving. A large figure standing under a canonv fills each of the nanelled sides. while many other smaller figures help to enrich the general effect. Examples of Gothic sounding boards are very rare; that, together with the pulpit, in the choir of Winchester is of the time of Prior Silkstede (1520), and is carved with his rebus, a skein of twisted silk. The usual form of font cover during the hundred years before the Reformation was pyramidal, the ribs of the salient angles being Fo straight and cusped (Frindsbury, Kent) or of curved outline and cusped (St Mildred, Canterbury). There is a very charming one of this form at Colebrook, Devon. It is quite plain but for a little angel kneeling on the top, with its hands clasped in prayer. But the most beautiful form is the massed collection of pinnacles and canopy work, of which there is such a fine example at Sudbury, Suffolk. It was not uncommon to carve a dove on the topmost pinnacle (Castleacre, Norfolk), in allusion to the descent of the Holy Spirit. The finest font in England is undoubtedly that of Ijiford, Suffolk. It rises some . in height, arid when the panels were painted with saints and the exquisite tabernacle work colored and gilded, must have been a masterpiece of Gothic craftsmanship. A cord connecting the tops of these covers with the roof or with a carved beam standing out from the wall, something like a crane (Salle, Norfolk), was used to remove the cover on the occasion of baptism. Many lecterns of the Gothic period do not exist today. They usually had a double sloping desk which revolved round a central moulded post. The lectern at Swanscombe, Kent, has an eras, circle of good foliage ornamenting each face of the book rest, and sonic tracery work at either end. The box form is more common in France than in England, the pedestal of such a lectern being surrounded by a casing of three or more sides. A good example with six sides is in the church of Vance (France), and one of triangular form in the Muse of Bourges, while a four-sided box lectern is still in use in the church of Lenham, Kent. The Gothic prayer desk, used for private devotional purposes, is hardly known in England, but is not uncommon on the Continent. There is a beautiful specimen in the Muse, Bourges; the front and sides of the part for kneeling are carved with that small tracery of flowing character so common in France and Belgium during the latter part of the 15th century, and the back, which rises to a height of ., contains a little crucifix with traceried decoration above and below. A word should be said about the ciboria, so often found on the Oboria continent of Europe. In tapering arrangement of tabernacle work they rival the English font covers in delicacy of outline (Muse, Rouen). Numbers of doors are to be met with not only in churches but also in private houses. Lavenham, Suffolk, is rich in work of this latter class. In England the general custom was to carve the head of the door only with tracery (East Brent, Somerset), but in the Tudor period doors were some times covered entirely with linenfold paneling (St Albans Abbey). This form of decoration was exceedingly common on the Continent as well as in England. In France the doors towards the latter part of the 15th century were often square-headed, or perhaps had the corners rounded. These doors were usually divided into some six or eight oblong panels of more or less equal size. One of the doors of Bourges Cathedral is treated thus, the panels being filled in with very good tracery enriched with crockets and coats of arms. But a more restrained form of treatment is constantly employed, as at the church of St Godard, Rouen, where the upper panels only are carved with tracery and coats of arms and the lower adorned with simple linenfold design. To Spain and the Teutonic countries of Europe we look for the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent altar-piece in Schleswig cathedral was carved by Hans Bruggerman, and consists, like many others, of a number of panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from Beauvais, there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being a good example of the style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and Alonso Cano and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. Triptychs and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an inch or two square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the Lord's Supper, and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni& applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor. With regard to paneling generally, there were, during the last fifty years of the period now under review, three styles of design followed by most European carvers, each of which attained great notoriety. Firstly, a developed form of small Panelling. tracery which was very common in France and the Netherlands. A square-headed panel would be filled in with small detail of flamboyant character, the perpendicular line or mullion being always subordinate, as in the German chasse (Muse Cluny), and in some cases absent, as the screen work of Évreux cathedral shows us. Secondly, the linenfold design. The great majority of examples are of a very conventional form, but at Bere Regis, Dorsetshire, the designs with tassels, and at St Sauvur, Caen, those with fringe work, readily justify the universal title applied to this very decorative treatment of large surfaces. At the beginning of the 16th century yet another pattern became the fashion. The main lines of the design consisted of flat hollow mouldings sometimes in the form of interlacing circles (Gatton, Surrey), at other times chiefly straight (Rochester cathedral), and the intervening spaces would be filled in with cusps or sprigs of foliage. It marks the last struggle of this great school of design to withstand the oncoming flood of the new art, the great Renaissance. From this time onward Gothic work, in spite of various attempts, has never again taken a place in domestic decoration. The lines of the tracery style, the pinnacle, and the crocket unequaled as they have always been in devotional expression are universally considered unsuited for decoration in the ordinary house. But little reference can be made to the domestic side of the period which ended with the dawn of the 16th century, because so few remains exist. At Bayeux, Bourges, Reims and preeminently Rouen, we see by the figures of saints, bishops or virgins, how much the religious feeling of the Middle Ages entered into the domestic life. In England the carved corner post (which generally carried a bracket at the top to support the overhanging storey) calls for comment. In Ipswich, there are several such posts. On one house near the river, that celebrated subject, the fox preaching to geese, is carved in graphic allusion to the dissemination of false doctrine. Of mantelpieces, there is a good example in the Rouen Museum. The overhanging corners are supported by dragons and the plain mouldings have little bunches of foliage carved at either end, a custom as common in France during the 15th century as it was in England a century earlier; the screen. beam at Eastbourne parish church, for example. As a rule, cabinets of the 15th century were rectangular in plan. In Germany and Austria the lower part was often enclosed, as well as the upper; the top, middle and lower rails being carved with geometrical design or with bands of foliage (Museum, Vienna). But it was also the custom to make these cupboards with the corners cut off, thus giving five sides to the piece of furniture. A very pretty instance, which is greatly enhanced by the metal work of the lock plates and hinges, is in the Muse Cluny, and there are other good specimens with the lower part open in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The chest was a very important piece of furniture, and is often to be met with covered with the most elaborate carving (Orleans Museum). There is a splendid chest (14th century) in the Cluny Museum; the front is carved with twelve knights in armour standing under as many arches, and the spandrels are filled in with faces, dragons and so on. But it is to the 15th century that we look for the best work of this class; there is no finer example than that in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin. The front is a very animated hunting scene most decoratively arranged in a scheme of foliage, and the top bears two coats of arms with helms, crests and mantling. But the more general custom in chest decoration was to employ tracery with or without figure work; Avignon Museum contains some typical examples of the latter class. A certain number of seats used for domestic purposes are of great interest. A good example of the long bench placed against the wall, with lofty panelled back and canopy over, is in the Musée Cluny, Paris. In the Museum at Rouen is a long seat of a movable kind with a low panelled back of pierced tracery, and in the Dijon Museum there is a good example of the typical chair of the period, with arms and high panelled and traceried back. There was a style of design admirably suited to the decoration of furniture when made of softwood such as pine. It somewhat resembled the excellent Scandinavian treatment of the 10th–12th centuries already referred to. A pattern of Gothic foliage, often of beautiful outline, would be simply grounded out to a shallow depth. The shadows, curves and twists only being emphasized by a few well- disposed cuts with a V tool; and of course the whole effect greatly improved by colour. A Swiss door of the 15th century in the Berlin Museum, and some German, Swiss and Tirolese work in the Victoria and Albert Museum, offer patterns that might well be imitated today by those who require simple decoration while avoiding the hackneyed Elizabethan forms. It is hard to compare the figure work of England with that on the Continent owing to the disastrous effect of the Reformation. But when we examine the roofs of the Eastern counties, the bench ends of Somerset, or the misericords in many parts of the country, we can appreciate how largely wood sculpture was used for purposes of decoration. If as a rule the figure work was I not of a very high order, we have conspicuous exceptions in the stall elbows of Sherborne, and the pulpit of Trull, Somerset. Perhaps the oldest instance is the often mutilated and often restored effigy of Robert, Duke of Normandy, in Gloucester Cathedral (12th century), and carved, as was generally the case in England, in oak. At Clifton Reynes, Buckingham, there are two figures of the 13th century. They are both hollowed out from the back in order to facilitate seasoning the wood and to prevent cracking. During the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries there are numberless instances of figure carving of the most graphic description afforded in the misericords in many of our churches and cathedrals. But of figures carved in the round apart from their surroundings hardly an instance remains. At the little chapel of Cartmel Fell, in the wilds of Westmorland, there is a figure of Our Lord from a crucifix, some in length. The cross is gone, the arms are broken away, and the feet have been burned off. A second figure of Our Lord (originally in the church of Keynes Inferior) is in the museum of Caerleon, and a third, from a church in Lincolnshire, is now in a private collection. On the continent some of the finest figure work is to be found in the retables, some of which are in the Victoria and Albert Museum. A Tirolese panel of the 15th century carved in high relief, representing St John seated with his back to the onlooker, is a masterpiece of perspective and foreshortening, and the drapery folds are perfect. The same may be said of a small statue of the Virgin, carved in lime by a Swiss hand, and some work of the great Tilman Riemenschneider of Wurzburg (1460–1531) shows that stone sculptors of medieval times were not ashamed of wood. =Renaissance period (16th–17th centuries)= With the beginning of the 16th century, the great Renaissance began to elbow its way in to the exclusion of Gothic design. But the process was not sudden, and much transition work has great merit. The rood screen at Hurst, Berkshire, the stall work of Cartmel Priory, Westmorland, and the bench ends of many of the churches in Somerset, give good illustrations. But the new style was unequal to the old in devotional feeling, except in classic buildings like St Paul's Cathedral, where the stalls of Grinling Gibbons better suit their own surroundings. The rest of this article will therefore be devoted in the main to domestic work, and the exact location of examples can only be given when not the property of private owners or where the public have access. During the 16th century the best work is undoubtedly to be found on the Continent. France, Germany and the Netherlands producing numberless examples not only of house decoration but of furniture as well. The wealth of the newly discovered American continent was only one factor which assisted in the civilizing influence of this time, and hand in hand with the spread of commerce came the desire for refinement. The custom of building houses chiefly in wood wherever timber was plentiful continued. Pilasters took the place of pinnacles, and vases or dolphins assisted the acanthus leaf to oust the older forms of design. House fronts of wood gave ample scope to the carver. That of Sir Paul Pinder (1600), formerly in Bishopsgate, but now preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is a good example of decorative treatment without overloading. The brackets carved in the shape of monsters which support the projecting upper storey are typical of hundreds of dwellings, as for instance St Peters Hospital, Bristol. The panels, too, of Sir Paul Pinders house are good examples of that Jacobean form of medallion surrounded by scroll work which is at once as decorative as it is simple. In England that familiar style known as Elizabethan and Jacobean prevailed throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. At the present time hardly a home in the land has not its old oak chest carved with the familiar half circle or scroll border along the top rail, or the arch pattern on the panels. The court cupboards, with their solid or open under parts and upper cornice supported by turned balusters of extravagant thickness, are to be seen wherever one goes. And chairs, real as well as spurious, with solid backs carved in the usual flat relief, are bought up with an avidity inseparable from fashion. Four-post bedsteads are harder to come by. The back is usually broken up into small panels and carved, the best effect being seen in those examples where the paneling or the framework only is decorated. The dining-hall tables often had six legs of great substance, which were turned somewhat after the shape of a covered cup, and were carved with foliage bearing a distant resemblance to the acanthus. Rooms were generally panelled with oak, sometimes divided at intervals by flat pilasters and the upper frieze carved with scroll work or dolphins. But the feature which distinguished the period was the fire mantle. It always must be the principal object in a room, and the Elizabethan carver fully appreciated this fact. By carving the chimney breast as a rule to the ceiling and covering the surrounding walls with more or less plain paneling, the designer, by thus concentrating the attention on one point, often produced results of a high order. Caryatid figures, pilasters and friezes were among the customary details employed to produce good effects. No finer example exists than that lately removed from the old palace at Bromley-by-Bow to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The mantelshelf is . from the ground and consists of a deep quadrant mould decorated with flat scroll work of good design. The supporting pilasters on either side are shaped and moulded in the customary Jacobean manner and are crowned by busts with Ionic capitals on the heads. Above the shelf the large center panel is deeply carved with the royal coat of arms with supporters and mantling, and on either side a semicircular arched niche contains a figure in classic dress. The Elizabethan carver often produced splendid staircases, sometimes carving the newel posts with heraldic figures bearing coats of arms, etc. The newels of a staircase at Highgate support different types of Cromwellian soldiers, carved with great vivacity and life. But in spite of excellent work, as for example the beautiful gallery at Hatfield, the carving of this period did not, so far as England was concerned, compare with other epochs, or with contemporary work in other parts of Europe. Much of the work is badly drawn and badly executed. It is true that good decorative effects were constantly obtained at the very minimum of cost, but it is difficult to discover much merit in work which really looks best when badly cut. In France this flat and simple treatment was to a certain extent used. Doors were most suitably adorned in this way, and the split baluster so characteristic of Jacobean work is often to be met with. There are some very good cabinets in the museum at Lyngby, Denmark, illustrating these two methods of treatment in combination. But the Swiss and Austrians elaborated this style, greatly improving the effect by the addition of color. However, the best Continental designs adopted the typical acanthus foliage of Italy, while still retaining a certain amount of Gothic feeling in the strength of the lines and the cut of the detail. Panelling often long and narrow was commonly used for all sorts of domestic purposes, a feature being a medallion in the center with a simple arrangement of vase, dolphins, dragons, or birds and foliage filling in the spaces above and below. The cabinets of the Netherlands and Belgium are excellent models of design. These pieces of furniture were usually arranged in two storeys with a fine moulded and carved cornice, mid division and plinth. The pilasters at the sides, and small raised panels carved only on the projecting part, would compose a very harmonious whole. A proportion of the French cabinets are decorated with caryatids not carved in the best taste, and, like other French woodwork of this period, are sometimes overloaded with sculpture. The doors of St Maclou, Rouen, fine as they are, would hardly to-day be held up as models for imitation. A noteworthy set of doors belong to the Oudenaarde Town Hall. The central door contains twelve and that on either side eight panels, each of which is carved with Renaissance foliage surrounding an unobtrusive figure. In the Palais de Justice we see that great scheme of decoration which takes up the whole of the fireplace end of the hall. Five large figures carved in the round are surrounded by small ones and with foliage and coats of arms. In Italy, the birthplace of the Renaissance, there is much fine work of the 16th century. A very important school of design was promoted by Raphael, whose patterns were used or adapted by a large number of craftsmen. The shutters of Raphaels Stanze in the Vatican, and the choir stalls in the church of St Pietro de Cassinesi at Perugia, are among the most beautiful examples of this style of carving. The work is in slight relief, and carved in walnut with those graceful patterns which Raphael developed out of the newly discovered remains of ancient Roman wall painting from the palace of Nero and other places. In the Victoria and Albert Museum are many examples of Italian work: the door from a convent near Parma, with its three prominent masks and heavy gadroon moulds; a picture frame with a charming acanthus border and, egg and tongue moulds on either side; and various marriage chests in walnut covered with very elaborate schemes of carving. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Spanish, or for that matter South of France work, from Italian, so much alike is the character. The Spaniards yield to none in good workmanship. Some Spanish panels of typical Italian design are in the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as cabinets of the purest Renaissance order. There is a wonderful Portuguese coffer (17th century) in this section. The top is deeply carved in little compartments with scenes from the life of Our Lord. =17th–18th centuries= In England, the great school of Grinling Gibbons arose. Although he carved many beautiful mouldings of conventional form (Hampton Court Palace, Chatsworth, etc.), his name is usually associated with a very heavy form of decoration which was copied direct from nature. Great swags of drapery and foliage with fruit and dead birds, etc., would be carved in lime a foot thick. For technical skill these examples are unsurpassed; each grape would be undercut, the finer stalks and birds legs stand out quite separate, and as a consequence soon succumb to the energy of the housemaid's broom. Good work of this class is to be found at Petworth; Trinity College, Oxford; Trinity College, Cambridge; St Pauls cathedral; St James, Piccadilly; and many other London churches. During the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV. the principal merit of carved design, i.e. its appropriateness and suitability, gradually disappeared. Furniture was often carved in a way hardly legitimate. The legs, the rails of tables and chairs, the frames of cabinets, of looking-glasses, instead of being first made fcr construction and strength. and then decorated, were first designed to carry cherubs heads and rococo (i.e. rock and shell ornament), quite regardless of utility or convenience. A wealth of such mistaken design was also applied to state carriages, to say nothing of bedsteads and other furniture. However, the wall paneling of the mansions of the rich, and sometimes the paneling of furniture, was decorated with rococo design in its least illegitimate form. The main part of the wood surface would be left plain, while the center would be carved with a medallion surrounded by foliage, vases or trophies of torches and musical instruments, etc., or perhaps the upper part of the panel would be thus treated. France led the fashion, which was more or less followed all over Europe. In England gilt chairs in the style of Louis XV. were made in some quantities. But Thomas Chippendale, Ince and Mayhew, Sheraton, Johnson, Heppelwhite and other cabinet-makers did not as a rule use much carving in their designs. Scrolls, shells, ribbon, ears of corn, etc., in very fine relief, were, however, used in the embellishment of chairs, etc., and the claw and ball foot was employed as a termination to the cabriole legs of cabinets and other furniture. The mantelpieces of the 18th century were, as a rule, carved in pine and painted white. Usually the shelves were narrow and supported by pilasters often of flat elliptic plan, sometimes by caryatids, and the frieze would consist of a raised center panel carved with a classic scene in relief, or with a mask alone, and on either side a swag of flowers, fruit and foliage. Baroque woodcarved apostles from Val Gardena Interior doorways were often decorated with a broken pediment more or less ornate, and a swag of foliage commonly depended from either side over a background of scroll work. The outside porches so often seen in Queen Anne houses were of a character peculiar to the 18th century. A small platform or curved roof was supported by two large and heavy brackets carved with acanthus scroll work. The staircases were as a rule exceedingly good. Carved and pierced brackets were fixed to the open strings (i.e. the sides of the steps), giving a very pretty effect to the graceful balustrade of turned and twisted columns. Renaissance figure work calls for little comment. During the 16th century many good examples were produced those priestly statues in the museum of Sens for example. But the figure work used in the decoration of cabinets, etc., seldom rose above the ordinary level. In the 18th century cherubs heads were fashionable and statuettes were sometimes carved in boxwood as ornaments, but as a means of decorating houses wood sculpture ceased to be. The Swiss, however, have kept up their reputation for animal sculpture to the present day, and still turn out cleverly carved chamois and bears, etc.; as a rule the more sketchily cut the better the merit. Their more ambitious works, their groups of cows, etc., sometimes reach a high level of excellence. Between the 17th and 18th century a florid woodcarving industry started in the Gardena valley, which is now located in the Italian province of South Tyrol. A network of people from that valley traveled on foot to all European cities, as far as to Lisbon and Saint Petersburg, to sell the products of hundreds of carvers. Finally in the 19th century in Gardena, mainly wooden toys and dolls known also as Dutch dolls or penny dolls, were carved by the millions of pieces. The Museum Gherdëina in Urtijëi displays a large collection of examples of woodcarcarvings from that region. Gilded woodcarving in Portugal and Spain continued to be produced, and the style exported to their New World colonies, and the Philippines, Macao and Goa. = 19th century to present day = Of the work of the 19th century onward little can be said in praise. Outside and beyond the present-day fashion for collecting old oak there seems to be no demand for carved decoration. In church work a certain number of carvers find occupation, as also for repairs or the production of imitations. But the carving one is accustomed to see in hotels or on board the modern ocean palace is in the main the work of the machine, often with finishing work done by human workers. Nonetheless, the 1800s saw the teaching of woodcarving became formalized in several European countries. For example, the Austrian woodcarver Josef Moriggl (1841–1908) had a long career as a teacher, culminating in his appointment in 1893 as Professor at the Staats-Gewerbeschule (Craft School) in Innsbruck, where he served until his retirement in 1907. In Gröden the institution of an art school in 1820 improved considerably the skills of the carvers. A new industrial branch developed with hundreds of artists and artisans dedicated to sculpture and manufacturing of statues and altars in wood exported to the whole world. Unfortunately the machine-carving industry, initiated in the 1950s and the Second Vatican Council, caused hundreds of carvers in Val Gardena to quit their craft. A worldwide trade of machine-carved figuerines and statues ensued.  Coptic  In the early medieval period screens and other fittings were produced for the Coptic churches of Egypt by native Christian workmen. In the British Museum there is a set of ten small cedar panels from the church door of Sitt Miriam, Cairo (13th century). The six sculptured figure panels are carved in very low relief and the four foliage panels are quite Oriental in character, intricate and fine both in detail and furnish. In the Cairo Museum there is much work treated, after the familiar Arab style, while other designs are quite Byzantine in character. The figure work is not of a very high order.  Islamic work  Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum, İstanbul Muslim wood-carvers of Persia, Syria, Egypt and Spain are renowned for their skill, designed and executed the richest paneling and other decorations for wall linings, ceilings, pulpits and all kinds of fittings and furniture. The mosques and private houses of Cairo, Damascus and other Oriental Cities are full of the most elaborate and minutely delicate woodwork. A favorite style of ornament was to cover the surface with very intricate interlacing patterns, formed by finely moulded ribs; the various geometrical spaces between the ribs were then filled in with small pieces of wood carved with foliage in slight relief. The use of different woods such as ebony or box, inlaid so as to emphasize the design, combined with the ingenious richness of the patterns, give this class of woodwork an almost unrivaled splendour of effect. Carved ivory is also often used for the filling in of the spaces. The Arabs are past masters in the art of carving flat surfaces in this way. A gate in the mosque of the sultan Bargoug (Cairo, 14th century) well illustrates this appreciation of lines and surfaces. The pulpit or mimbar (15th century) from a Cairo mosque, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is also a good example in the same style, the small spaces in this case being filled in with ivory carved in flat relief. Screens made up of labyrinths of complicated joinery, consisting of multitudes of tiny balusters connecting hexagons, squares or other forms, with the flat surfaces constantly enriched with small carvings, are familiar to every one. In Cairo we also have examples in the mosque of Qous (12th century) of that finely arranged geometrical interlacing of curves with foliage terminations which distinguishes the Saracenic designer. Six panels in the Victoria and Albert Museum (13th century), and work on the tomb of the sultan Li Ghoury (16th century), show how deeply this form of decoration was ingrained in the Arab nature. Figure work and animals were sometimes introduced, in medieval fashion, as in the six panels just referred to, and at the hflpital du Moristan (13th century) and the mosque of El Nesfy Qeycoun (14th century). There is a magnificent panel on the door of Beyt-el-Emyr. This exquisite design is composed of vine leaves and, grapes of conventional treatment in low relief. The Arab designer was fond of breaking up his paneling in a way reminding one of a similar Jacobean custom. The main panel would be divided into a number of hexagonal, triangular or other shapes, and each small space filled in with conventional scroll work. Much of this simple flat design reminds one of that Byzantine method from which the Elizabethan carvers were inspired.  Persia  The Persian carvers closely followed Arab design. A pair of doors of the 14th century from Samarkand (Victoria and Albert Museum) are typical. Boxes, spoons and other small articles were often fretted with interlacing lines of Saracenic character, the delicacy and minuteness of the work requiring the utmost patience and skill. Many of the patterns remind one, of the sandalwood work of Madras, with the difference that the Persians v~ere satisfied with a much lower relief. Sometimes a very beautiful result was obtained by the sparing tise of fretted lattice pattern among foliage. A fine panel of the 14th century in the Victoria and Albert Museum shows how active was Arab influence even as far as Bokhara.  India and Burma  Throughout the great Indian peninsula woodcarving of the most luxurious kind has been continuously produced for many centuries. The ancient Hindu temples were decorated with doors, ceilings and various fittings carved in teak and other woods with patterns of extreme richness and minute elaboration. The doors of the temple of Somnath, on the north-west coast, were famed for their magnificence and were highly valued as sacred relics. In 1024 they were taken to Ghazni by the Moslem conqueror, Sultan Mahmud, and are now lying at the fort at Agra. The gates which now exist are very fine specimens of ancient woodcarving, but are likely copies of the original, likely ancient, doors. Many doors, columns, galleries or even entire house-fronts are covered with the most intricate design bewildering to behold (Bhera, Shahpur). But this is not always the case, and the Oriental is at times more restrained in his methods. Architectural detail is to be seen with enrichment carved round the framing. Hindu treatment of the circle is often exceedingly good, and might perhaps less rarely inspire western design. Foliage, fruit and flowers are constantly adapted to a scheme of fret-cut decoration for doors or windows as well as the frames of chairs and the edges of tables. Southern Indian wood carvers are known to work often with sandalwood, always covered with design, where scenes or characters from Hindu mythology occupy space. Many of the gong stands of Burma show the highest skill; the arrangement of two figures bearing a pole from which a gong hangs is familiar.  Indochina and the Far East  Details of a Vietnamese wooden ceiling In these countries the carver is unrivaled for deftness of hand. Grotesque and imitative work of the utmost perfection is produced, and many of the carvings of these countries, Japan in particular, are beautiful works of art, especially when the carver copies the lotus, lily or other aquatic plant. A favorite form of decoration consists of breaking up the architectural surfaces, such as ceilings, friezes, and columns, into framed squares and filling each panel with a circle, or diamond of conventional treatment with a spandrels in each corner. A very Chinese feature is the finial of the newel post, so constantly left more or less straight in profile and deeply carved with monsters and scrolls. A heavily enriched moulding bearing a strong resemblance to the gadroon pattern is commonly used to give emphasis to edges, and the dragon arranged in curves imitative of nature is frequently employed over a closely designed and subordinated background. Detail of a Vietnamese wooden column The general rule that in every country designers use much the same means whereby a pattern is obtained holds good in China. There are forms of band decoration here which closely resemble those of Gothic Europe, and a chair from Turkestan (3rd century) might almost be Elizabethan, so like are the details. Screens of grill form, often found in the historically Islamic countries, are common, and the deeply grounded, closely arranged patterns of Bombay also have their counterparts. The imperial dais in the Chien-Ching Hall, Beijing, is a masterpiece of intricate design. The back consists of one central panel of considerable height, with two of lesser degree on either side luxuriously carved. The whole is crowned with a very heavy crest of dragons and scroll work; the throne also is a wonderful example of carved treatment, and the doors of a cabinet in the same building show how rich an effect of foliage can be produced without the employment of stalk or scroll. One might almost say, he wastes his talent on such an ungrateful material as wood. In this material fans and other trifles are carved with a delicacy that courts disaster. In Japan much of the Chinese type is apparent. The native carver is fond of massing foliage without the stalk to lead him. He appears to put in his foliage, fruit and flowers first and then to indicate a stalk here and there, thus reversing the order of the Western method. Such a treatment, especially when birds and beasts are introduced, has the highest decorative effect. But, as such close treatment is bound to do, it depends for success to some extent upon its scheme of color. A long panel in the Victoria and Albert Museum, depicting merchants with their packhorse, strongly resembles in its grouping and treatment Gothic work of the 15th century, as for example the panel of St Hubert in the museum at Châlons. The strength and character of Japanese figure work is quite equal to the best Gothic sculpture of the 15th century.  Aboriginal  There is a general similarity running through the carved design of most races of primitive culture, the chip form of ornament being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may no doubt be accounted for by the extensive use of stone cutting tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by crowding on too much design as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal of restraint by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So far as his chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but when he takes to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race. A very favorite style of chip pattern is that formed by small triangles and squares entirely covering a surface in the Cook Islands, the monotony being sometimes varied by a band of different arrangement in the middle of the article or at the top or bottom. So far as the cultivation of patience and accuracy is concerned, has no equal. The Fiji Islanders, employ chip designs rivaling those of Europe in variety. Upon occasion the aboriginal Marquesas carver appreciates the way in which plain surfaces contrast and emphasize decorated parts, and judiciously restricts his skill to bands of decoration or to special points. The Ijos of the lower Niger design their paddles in a masterly way, and show a fine sense of proportion between the plain and the decorated surface. Their designs, though slightly in relief, are of the chip nature. The method of decorating a subject with groups of incised lines, straight or curved, though often very effective and in every way suitable, is not a very advanced form of art and has decided limits. The natives of the Congo, now two nations, covered by the landmass of the Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo does good work of this kind. Carving in relief is common enough, idols being produced in many forms. The South African carves the handle of his spoon perhaps in the form of a giraffe, and in the round, with each leg cut separately and the four hoofs meeting at the bowl, hardly a comfortable form of handle to hold. The North American Indian shows a wider invention than some nations, the twist in various shapes being a favorite treatment say of pipe stems. The Papuan has quite a style of his own; he uses a scroll of the form familiar in Indian shawls, and in some cases the scroll entwines in a way which faintly suggests the guilloche. The native of New Guinea also employs the scroll for a motive, the flat treatment of which reminds one of a similar method in use in Scandinavian countries. The work of the New Zealander is greatly in advance of the average primitive type; he uses a very good scheme of scroll work for decorative purposes, the lines of the scrolls often being enriched with a small pattern in a way reminding one of the familiar Norman treatment, as for example the prows of his canoes. The Maori wood carver sometimes carves not only the barge boards of his house but the gables also, reptilian and grotesque figures being as a rule introduced; the main posts and rafters, too, of the inside receive attention. Unlike the Hindu he has a good idea of decorative proportion, and does not plan his scheme of design on too small a scale.

The tenure of the paper in Corvallis, like that of the state capital, was brief and fleeting and soon the town was left with no paper of its own. Town founder Joseph C. Avery, himself a Democratic partisan, sought to fill the void with a new paper. He purchased press, type, and supplies and hired a small staff to launch a new publication called the Occidental Messenger in 1857. This short-lived publication was followed by a series of others which briefly glimmered and vanished like fireflies, including the Expositor, the Benton Democrat, and the Benton County Blade.Fagan 1885, p. 440. Two publications did manage to gain traction in Corvallis and Benton County, however — The Corvallis Gazette, a Republican paper established in December 1863, and the Benton Leader, a Democratic weekly, launched in 1882. The Corvallis Gazette The Corvallis Gazette was launched in December 1863, during the midst of the American Civil War by T. B. Odeneal. The paper was initially operated as a weekly, with publication taking place each Saturday. In February 1866, Odeneal was joined on the staff by William B. Carter, who assumed complete control of the paper in July of that same year, transforming it into an organ of the Oregon division of the International Organization of Good Templars. Under Carter's editorship the Gazette became a leading voice for prohibition. This general orientation continued until March 1870, when a new ownership group took control of the paper, making Samuel L. Simpson the new editor of the paper. Simpson immediately noted the change in an editorial, writing: > Temperance ceases to be the speciality of this paper, as, in fact, it is not > the forte of the present editor..... Right here the bright habiliments of > neutrality are laid aside forever, and wheeling into line the good champion > of prohibition goes down in the smoke and fury of political war. This third iteration of the paper would become a vigorous partisan supporter of the agenda of the Republican Party. Carter would soon return to the editorial chair, with the paper's new political line unaltered. In January 1876, the size of the Gazette was enlarged and in December of that same year the publication was made into a corporation, with editor William Carter one of the three incorporators. Carter's supremacy would end with his death in 1880, with fellow incorporator James A. Yantis taking over the operation of the publication until its eventual sale to M. S. Woodcock in May 1881. In 1885, Corvallis pioneer Bushrod Washington Wilson and two other investors established the Gazette Publishing Company, which purchased the Corvallis Gazette from its previous publisher, M. S. Woodcock, on December 25.Martin 1938, p. 281. This holding company published the paper for only one year before selling the paper again, this time to Frank Conover.Martin 1938, pp. 281–282. Later editors of the paper included W. P. Keady, later Speaker of Oregon House of Representatives in the Oregon Legislative Assembly; Will H. Parry who later founded the Capital Journal in Salem, Oregon; and later Springer, who launched the Gazette's daily edition in 1909. The Gazette was known briefly as a The Union Gazette following its 1899 merger with the Oregon Union which had been founded in 1897. The Union portion of the name was soon dropped. (A previous Corvallis newspaper called Union, published in the 1860s, was not affiliated. It was suppressed following the Civil War.) The Corvallis Times The Times traces its lineage first to the founding of The Corvallis Chronicle in 1886. During the 1880s the construction of the Oregon Pacific Railroad dominated local politics in Corvallis and surrounding Benton County. The Gazettes owners, M.S. Woodcock, A.P. Churchill and Wallace Baldwin, who had taken over the paper in 1884 were closely allied with the interests of the railroad. Gazette editor C.A. Cole, was according to one account fired for refusing to obey instructions of the paper's owners to support a Democratic, pro-railroad candidate for state senator. He lost his job the day after the election. Wishing to explain to the community why he had been fired, Cole secured permission to publish an issue under the condition that the proofs first be submitted for approval by a railroad representative. Cole never did submit the proofs for approval. Republicans, sensing opportunity, decided to finance another paper. The Corvallis Chronicle debuted as a weekly paper published on Fridays in 1886, with Cole as its editor. The paper did not succeed and soon folded. In 1888, a local businessman, Robert Johnson, who had previously worked as city editor of The Gazette, bought the Chronicles printing press and assets at a sheriff's auction. He launched The Corvallis Times with the slogan \\"Independent, Fearless and Free.\\" Johnson operated The Times until 1893, when he sold it to Benjamin Franklin Irvine, a telegraph operator for the railroad. Irvine acquired another area newspaper The Benton Leader, founded in 1882 with The Times. The Gazette and Times combine The events leading to the combination of Corvallis' two major newspapers began in 1908. The Times was operated by N.R. Moore, who had leased the paper from B.F. Irvine, who had left Corvallis to write editorials for the Oregon Journal in Portland, Oregon. The Gazette was under the direction of Charles L. Springer, formerly of Montesano, Washington and owned by M.S. Woodcock, a prominent Benton County lawyer and businessman who later opened a successful bank in the county, and later served as Corvallis Mayor. According to historical accounts, they decided on the name Gazette-Times after a coin toss. Springer had come to town and purchased the Gazette and on May 1, 1909, published its first daily edition. It had four pages and five columns. Moore also had plans to launch a daily edition. Still, neither Springer, nor Moore had sufficient resources to publish a daily newspaper over the long term. They agreed to consolidate, and flipped a coin to decide the name. The first issue of The Gazette-Times appeared on July 2, 1909. Claude Ingalls, who came to Corvallis from Washington, Kansas, bought out Springer's share in the paper in 1915. Myron K. Myers bought out Moore's share in 1923. Myers' son, Bruce, later shared ownership with Ingalls' son, Robert C. Ingalls. They assumed the top positions at the paper when their fathers retired in 1950. Charles A. Sprague, originally from Kansas, spent some time (from 1925-1929) as one-third owner of the Corvallis Gazette-Times before moving to Salem and becoming part owner of the Oregon Statesman there. Lee Enterprises bought the newspaper on October 1, 1969, and continues to operate it to the present day. The Philomath Express On September 23, 2020, The Philomath Express published its last weekly edition. It is now accessed through a community website at the Gazette-Times online edition.

Area code 910 was established in 1993 as a split from area code 919, and was the state's first new area code in 39 years. Originally, it covered a fan-shaped region in the southeastern and north- central portions of the state, including the Piedmont Triad, the Sandhills, and the southeastern coast. The two parts were only connected by a tendril in the Sandhills. Within only three years, 910 was already on the brink of exhaustion due to rapid growth in the Triad, Wilmington and Fayetteville, as well as the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. On December 15, 1997, area code 336 was created for the Triad and most of the old 910 territory's western portion. Normally, when an area code is split, the more populated portion keeps the old area code–in this case, the Triad. However, it was decided to let the southeastern portion of the state keep 910. Prior usage for TWX Area code 910 was originally designated for one of three US regional numbering plan areas for the former AT&T; Corporation TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network, sold to Western Union in 1969 and renamed as Telex II. It covered every US point west of the Mississippi River. The original TWX area codes were 510 in the US and 610 in Canada. The addition of 710 in the Northeast (New England, NY, NJ, PA, MD, DC, VA, and WV), 810 in MI OH IN and most of the South (NC, SC, GA, FL, LA, MS, FL, AL, and KY) and 910 west of the Mississippi allowed each major city one or more local exchange prefixes in the special numbering plan area.AT&T; Long Lines (1975), Traffic Routing Guide, Section 15-16 The service operated at 110 bit per second transmission rates on Bell 101 modems and mechanical teletypewriters.

It is designed to transport and provide the specialized equipment necessary for technical rescue.For example, Pelastustoimen yleisopas: raivausauto (A general guide for rescue vehicles: rescue vehicle) (In Finnish). Ministry of the Interior, Finland. http://www.pelastustoimi.fi/raportit/pelastusajoneuvojen- yleisopas/raivausauto, retrieved April the 28th, 2007 They carry an array of special equipment such as the jaws of life, wooden cribbing, generators, winches, hi-lift jacks, cranes, cutting torches, circular saws and other forms of heavy equipment unavailable on standard trucks. This capability differentiates them from traditional pumper trucks or ladder trucks designed primarily to carry firefighters and their entry gear as well as on-board water tanks, hoses and equipment for fire extinguishing and light rescue. Most rescue vehicles lack on-board water tanks and pumping gear, owing to their specialized role. A rescue vehicle is typically operated by a rescue squad, but in some areas it may be integrated with emergency medical services or fire departments.  Uses  Rescue vehicles can be popular choices for incident command vehicles, federal and local law enforcement (command/communications, SWAT, bomb response, etc.), rehab, HazMat incidents, light & air, urban search and rescue (USAR), and more. Furthermore, many rescue vehicles can be outfitted based on their target environmental setting, such as municipal, industrial, or wildland. These configurations, determined by the operational agency and district, and worked out with the manufacturing company, provide a plethora of options for storage, response, equipment, size, and more.  Types  Depending on the size of the vehicle and the equipment it carries, a rescue vehicle might fall into different categories, such as light, medium, heavy rescue, or technical rescue. While each of these categories often have overlapping tasks, they may be classified differently for the sake of dispatch on certain kinds of incidents. For instance, in Loudoun County, Virginia, the Loudoun County Fire and Rescue Department operates medium and heavy rescue apparatus, which are categorized based on equipment carried. In Loudoun, to avoid confusion, a medium rescue is referred to as a squad truck or a technical rescue (or just squad), while a heavy rescue, which carries more equipment and is almost always larger, is referred to as a rescue (or heavy rescue). This differentiation exists to allow vehicles that would not normally be classified as medium rescues, such as certain rescue engines, or tower/ladder trucks to be dispatched on calls requiring a higher level of technical rescue, if the regular squad has been dispatched. This in turn leaves the heavy rescue apparatus available, as opposed to sending them on a call that could have been handled by a medium rescue. Many heavy rescue vehicles carry equipment for responses to Multiple Casualty Incidents, Chemical spills and other situations. some rescue vehicles carry specialized rescue tools for all kinds of technical rescues including Ropes,Water Rescue equipment, numerous types of cutting and prying tools and other equipment that helps in all kinds of rescue situations. In the United States, National Fire Protection Association standards 1006 and 1670 give guidance for the operation of rescue vehicles and also state that all \\"rescuers\\" must have medical training equivalent to EMT-Basic standard to perform any technical rescue operation, including cutting into the vehicle itself.NFPA 1006 Standard for Rescue Technician Professional Qualifications. 2003 Edition. National Fire Protection Association.NFPA 1670 Standard on Operations and Training for Technical Search and Rescue Incidents. 2004 Edition. National Fire Protection Association. Therefore, in most all rescue environments, whether it is an EMS or fire department that performs the rescue, the actual rescuers who cut the vehicle and run the extrication scene are medical first responders, emergency medical technicians, or paramedics, as a traffic collision has a patient involved. Railway rescue VR. In addition to traditional fire brigades and rescue departments, tram or railway companies may have their own rescue squads specialized in responding to tram or train wrecks including derailments.For example, Helsinki City Transport’s tram rescue unit in http://www.fireimages.net/displayimage.php?pos=-9508, retrieved on 9th of May, 2007.For example, VR railway rescue squad in http://www.fireimages.net/displayimage.php?pos=-18186, retrieved on 9th of May, 2007. For example, railway rescue squads may carry specialized equipment for railway crashes, like heavy hydraulic jacks, heavy truck-mounted cranes for lifting and moving derailed locomotives and train cars, and equipment for capping leaking tank cars.Visiiri 2/2006, pp. 6 – 7, on the heavy rescue unit of VR Railway Company in Helsinki, Finland, , retrieved on May 9th, 2007.

Biography Higginson was born in New York City on November 18, 1834, the second child of George Higginson and Mary Cabot Lee.Perry, Bliss, Life and Letters of Henry Lee Higginson (Boston: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1921) He was a distant cousin of Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When he was four his family moved to Boston. George jointly founded a brokerage as a junior partner, was extremely patriotic, and never owned a house or a horse of his own until within a few years of his death. Henry’s mother died of tuberculosis, from which she suffered for some time, when Henry was 15. Henry graduated from Boston Latin School in 1851, only after withdrawing twice due to eye fatigue problems. He began studies at Harvard College, but withdrew after 4 months when he again experienced eye fatigue and he was sent to Europe. Upon returning to Boston in March 1855, Henry's father secured a position for him in the office of Messrs. Samuel and Edward Austin, India merchants, a small shipping counting house on India Wharf where he worked as the sole company clerk and bookkeeper. Henry Lee Higginson entered the Union Army in May 1861, as second lieutenant of Company D in Colonel George H. Gordon's 2nd Massachusetts Regiment, and fought at the First Battle of Bull Run. He was commissioned major in the 1st Massachusetts Cavalry in March 1862. In the Battle of Aldie (1863) Higginson was knocked from his saddle and received three saber cuts and two pistol wounds. While recovering in Boston he married Ida Agassiz, daughter of Harvard professor Louis Agassiz, on December 5, 1863. Though he retired from the military as a colonel, he was commonly addressed as \\"Major\\" for the rest of his life to avoid confusion with his older cousin Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who was called Colonel Higginson.Amory, 56 =Career= After the war, he worked as an agent for the Buckeye Oil Company in Ohio from January to July 1865, purchasing equipment and contracting laborers to work in the oil fields. In October 1865, he and friends paid $30,000 for five thousand acres (20 km²) of cotton-farming land in Georgia. This failed philanthropic adventure left him more than $10,000 in debt. Reluctantly at first, out of desperation, he started on January 1, 1868, as a clerk and later became a junior partner in his father’s business, Lee, Higginson & Co., which at the time was a modest brokerage. His father had been a junior partner until 1858 and worked until his death in 1889 at age 85. This brokerage and banking company eventually became very profitable. Henry Lee Higginson was eventually a senior partner.Amory, 313 In 1913, he offered this assessment of changes in business over the course of his career: \\"There has been a steady improvement in the management of the Stock Exchange since I came down to the financial district. The methods in use to-day are very much better than they were many years ago. Men dealing with the Exchange are better protected.\\" He allowed that there were still \\"rascals\\" and \\"a good many men who still need watching,\\" but \\"not so many as there have been in years past.\\"New York Times: \\"Business Ethics Improving,\\" March 3, 1913, accessed January 24, 2010 =Boston Symphony Orchestra= Higginson described his plans for a symphony orchestra two years after he launched the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1881:H.L. Higginson, September 20, 1882, Letter to Sir George Grove describing the founding of the BSO for the 1883 printing of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians. :In February '81 [1881] I began to put in shape a scheme conceived twenty-five years before that date [1856], namely to give orchestral concerts of the best attainable character and quality at a price which should admit any one and everyone likely to care for such things - my hope was to draw in by degrees a larger and less-educated class of society - I had meant to engage an orchestra and a conductor to be at my beck and call because this only could I ask and get practice sufficient in amount and quality to reach the playing of the great German orchestras. On March 30, 1881, Higginson published in Boston newspapers his plan for a \\"Boston Symphony Orchestra\\" that would perform as a \\"full and permanent orchestra, offering the best music at low prices, such as may be found in all the large European cities.\\"Howe, Orchestra, 24 He advised his first music director, George Henschel, to hire only local musicians for the first year so as to avoid creating bad blood in local musical circles.Howe, Orchestra, 23 For the first season's series of 20 concerts, prices were set at $10 or $5 for the whole series. Single ticket prices were set at 75 and 25 cents. For the weekly afternoon public rehearsal, seats were unreserved and all priced at 25 cents.Howe, Orchestra, 25 The concert venue was the Boston Music Hall, and the orchestra would travel locally, offering concerts in such cities as Providence, Portland, and Worcester, as well as several in Cambridge at Harvard University's Sanders Theater.Howe, Orchestra, 27-8, 50 Soon, to address concerns about the availability of tickets, 505 tickets for the afternoon rehearsal concerts were sold for 25 cents to those who joined the queue outside the hall in advance of the performance.Howe, Orchestra, 44-5, 53 Tours to more distant cities followed, starting with Philadelphia and then New York.Howe, Orchestra, 66 Casual summer concerts began in 1885.Howe, Orchestra, 81 Portrait by John Singer Sargent (1903) in the Harvard Art Museums. A copy by Sargent's students is in Symphony Hall. For many years, the organization accepted support from no one other than Higginson, who made up the annual deficit himselfAmory, 117 (in one year as much as $52,000).Howe, Orchestra, 61 From the very beginning through at least the first 30 years of the BSO, through Julius Epstein, a Jewish friend in Vienna, Higginson had access to a continuous stream of the best conductors in the world, all European and German-speaking.Howe, Orchestra, 60-61 In 1906, he sent instructions to those hiring on his behalf that the person they choose should understand that Higginson cared neither for modern music nor \\"the extreme modern style of conducting.\\" He elaborated his tastes in another letter:New York Times: \\"Finding a New Music Director the Old-Fashioned Way,\\" October 8, 2000, accessed February 8, 2010 :If you see Walter or Mengelberg, you will have to say to them . . . that I do know something about music, and that I have very distinct ideas as to how music should be played; that I shall not meddle with modern music, but that I shall certainly ask them to play the classics as they were played. I was brought up in the Vienna school (as you know) and there were plenty of men living then who had heard Beethoven conduct, as well as Mendelssohn, and knew how he wished his music given. I have known Brahms myself and heard his music. You know well enough what I wish, and I shall not interfere unduly with any of these men, but I don't want crazy work (such as sometimes even Nikisch gave us, and Paur gave us too often), and perhaps you had better tell them that I hate noise. As sole administrator of the BSO during its early years, Higginson ensured the success of his new organization by tightly controlling the professional musicians. In 1882, he forged a new contract requiring his musicians to make themselves available from Wednesday to Saturday during the season and on those days to \\"neither play in any other orchestra nor under any other conductor...except if wanted in your leisure hours by the Handel and Haydn Society,\\" a collegial gesture to a much older organization.Howe, Orchestra, 39 After the fourth season, he authorized the BSO's conductor Wilhelm Gericke to recruit twenty musicians while summering in Europe to replace some who were \\"old and overworked.\\"Howe, Orchestra, 64, 71 For example, Higginson aggregated control by \\"threatening to break any strike with the importation of European players.\\" Furthermore, over time he dropped musicians with ties to Boston and imported men from Europe of \\"high technical accomplishment, upon whose loyalty he could count.\\"DiMaggio, During World War I, Higginson and the BSO's music director Karl Muck were the focus of public controversy when the orchestra failed to add the Star-Spangled Banner to its concerts as other orchestras did. Muck's ties to the German Kaiser made for exaggerated press coverage, but Higginson was the particular focus of criticism. The New York Times called him \\"obstinate\\" for his refusal to allow public sentiment to affect programming.New York Times: \\"Karl Muck,\\" March 5, 1940, January 20, 2010 The orchestra's publicity agent, writing years later, blamed Muck's eventual internment as an enemy alien on the \\"short-sighted stubbornness\\" of Higginson and the orchestra's manager Charles A. Ellis on the anthem issue.New York Times: William E. Walter, \\"Dr. Muck and the First War,\\" March 10, 1940, accessed January 20, 2010.

The announcement of a board of trustees to manage an incorporated Boston Symphony Orchestra came on April 27, 1918.M.A. DeWolfe Howe, The Boston Symphony Orchestra, 1881-1931 (Boston, 1931), 137-9; New York Times: \\"Maj. Higginson out of Boston Symphony,\\" April 28, 1918, accessed January 12, 2010 =Other activities= In 1882, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Harvard University and served as the first president of the new Harvard Club of Boston during a period when he helped raise a lot of money to send needy students to Harvard. He was awarded an honorary LL.D. from Yale University in 1901. He served as president of the Boston Music Hall and as a trustee of the New England Conservatory of Music from 1892-1919. He was also the president of the Tavern Club from more than 20 years, a \\"literary social club.\\"Sinfonia: John Mongiovi, \\"Sinfonia and the Union of Spiritual and Musical Idealism\\" , accessed January 17, 2010; Amory, 312 On June 5, 1890, Higginson presented Harvard College a gift of of land, which he called Soldiers Field, given in honor of his friends who died in the Civil War: James Savage, Jr., Charles Russell Lowell, Edward Barry Dalton, Stephen George Perkins, James Jackson Lowell, and Robert Gould Shaw. This land later became Harvard's baseball field, where it still plays today. On June 10 of that year, at the dedication of Soldiers Field, he said:Perry, pp. 233, 536 :One of these friends, Charles Lowell, dead, and yet alive to me as you are, wrote me just before his last battle:-- \\"Don't grow rich; if you once begin, you'll find it much more difficult to be a useful citizen. Don't seek office; but don't 'disremember' that the useful citizen holds his time, his trouble, his money, and his life always ready at the hint of his country. The useful citizen is a mighty unpretending hero; but we are not going to have a country very long unless such heroism is developed. There! what a stale sermon I'm preaching! But, being a soldier, it does seem to me that I should like nothing so well as being a useful citizen.\\" This was his last charge to me, and in a month he was in his grave. I have tried to live up to it, and I ask you to take his words to heart and to be moved and guided by them. His devotion to education was both enthusiastic and patrician. Once, when advising a cousin to make a large contribution to Harvard he wrote:Amory, 173. Quoted also in part: Richard Norton Smith, The Harvard Century: The Making of a University to a Nation (NY: Simon and Schuster, 1986), 50-1 :How else are we to save our country if not by education in all ways and on all sides? What can we do so useful to the human race in every aspect? It is wasting your time to read such platitudes. :Democracy has got fast hold of the world and will rule. Let us see that she does it more wisely and more humanly than the kings and nobles have done! Our chance is now-before the country is full and the struggle for bread becomes intense and bitter. :Educate, and save ourselves and our families and our money from mobs! Sometime before 1913, he lent his name as an officer to the efforts of the Immigration Restriction League, which campaigned on behalf of literacy tests to limit immigration. Their avoidance of more straightforward racial categories and quotas only masked their fundamental bias against immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.Barbara Miller Solomon, Ancestors and Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1956), 123 and ch. 6 passim Other gifts to Harvard included $150,000 contributed in 1899 for the construction of the Harvard Union, a \\"house of fellowship\\" for all students of Harvard, where they could dine, study, meet, and listen to lectures. A few years later, he raised $10,000 to defray the costs of tuition and living expenses for students from China, a program somewhat at odds with America's exclusion of Chinese immigrants at the time.Marsha Graham Synnott, The Half-Opened Door: Discrimination and Admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, 1900-1970 (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1979), 55. The students were not immigrants to the United States, but thought to be the future leaders of China. Higginson was very active in promoting quality education to citizens from all walks of life. In 1891, Higginson established the Morristown School for young men, now the Morristown-Beard School, declining to be named the school's founder. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of Middlesex School, and the school's Higginson House dormitory is named for him. He was generally impatient with politicians. He objected to Theodore Roosevelt's attacks on big business. He wrote him: \\"Cease all harsh words about corporations and capitalists.\\" He did not hesitate to provide President Wilson with unsolicited advice on his conduct of World War I. Higginson in 1903 became an early advocate for the motor vehicle license plate. Annoyed by drivers speeding by his summer home in Ipswich, Massachusetts with anonymous impunity, Higginson drafted a petition to the state legislature. The petition cited the need for a law whose provisions would expand upon those of a 1901 New York motor vehicle registration law by calling for state-issued license plates to be prominently displayed on all motor vehicles. https://www.thoughtco.com/1903-the-first- license-plates-us-1779187 \\"Stopped for speeding?

It was popular with blues and jazz musicians in southern Louisiana in the 1930s, including Duke Ellington's orchestra, and was played during breaks in the back rooms of bars and saloons. In many other places it has become a popular pastime for workers while on their lunch breaks. It can be played for just points or for money wagered. Description Tonk is usually played for money wagered (with a stake agreed on before each game starts). Each player pays the stake to the winner of the hand. Games typically involve two to four players. Stakes may be any amount. A game consists of several hands. The players take turns dealing. A standard fifty-two card deck (plus two jokers) is used. The jokers are wild and can be played as any card needed by the player who's lucky enough to get one of the jokers. Play Players are dealt five, seven, or nine cards, depending on the number of players, in turn. The dealer turns up the first of the un-dealt cards as the start of the discard pile. In some variations, the dealer does not turn up the first card; the discard pile is started after the first player draws. The remaining un-dealt cards are set face down in a stack next to the discard pile. These form the stock. The goal of play is to get rid of one's cards by forming them into spreads. A spread is three or four identical cards (such as three 5's or four queens), or three or more in a row of the same suit. A player may add cards to their own or another's spread. The winner is the first to get rid of all their cards, or the player with the fewest points when play is stopped. Play stops when a player gets rid of all their cards, or when a player drops, by laying their cards face up on the table. Depending on the variation, a player may drop at any point in the game, including right after the cards are dealt, or only before drawing. When a player drops, all the players likewise lay their cards face up. The player with the fewest points in their hand is the winner. If the player who dropped does not have the fewest points, they must pay the stake to each player with fewer points: this is called being caught. In addition, each player pays the stake to the winner. If there is a tie, both players are paid. If the tie is between the player who dropped and another player, the one who dropped is considered caught and must pay double, with the other player being the sole winner. If the player does not drop, they must take the top card from the discard pile or draw a card from the stock. The player may then lay face up any spreads, or add to any spreads on the table. If after this the player has no more cards, they say \\"tonk\\" and win, and each player pays them a double stake. Some play that a player must spread with six cards to tonk, otherwise the player goes out with zero effectively ending the game but only winning a single stake. If the player has one or more cards remaining, they must discard one card to the discard pile. If this is their last card, play ends: they are the winner, and each player pays them the stake. If the player has one or more cards left in their hand after discarding, their turn ends. If the stock runs out, play stops. The player with the fewest points in their hand wins, and is paid the stake by each player. If two or more players tie the hand is a draw, and another hand is dealt. Many variations in play are possible. =Melding= Players can meld sets (three of the same rank card) or runs (three consecutive cards in the same suit, e.g. ). Aces may be played as high or low card, but may not \\"bridge the gap\\" in a meld (e.g. ). =Hitting= Hitting is a variation of the common laying off of another player's meld (i.e.: hitting an opponent's set of three 10s with the other 10). The card is put with the melds of the player who is receiving the hit. However, when a player \\"hits\\" another player, the player receiving the hit cannot lay down for one turn. Multiple hits result in additional loss of lay downs for turns thereafter. After a player has hit another player, the hitting player is allowed to discard a card from their hand. Once a player's set has been hit and the four cards of that rank are melded, they can be thrown into the discard pile. Players cannot spread out. =Tonking out (doubles)= Tonking out is the preferred method of winning the game. It is achieved by melding or hitting until no cards remain in the player's hand. The difference between tonking out and running out is that when a player tonks out, they use all six cards in either a spread or by hitting multiple times. When a player \\"runs out\\", they use five cards and discard one. When a game is played for money, tonking out usually results in a double payment. Tonk out double: In some variations, usually two-player, a player who \\"tonks out\\" with a run that subsequently allows the other player to tonk out on those cards results in a \\"double-double\\". For example, a player holding and draws the and tonks out, while the remaining player is holding and and tonks out as a result of the other player's hand, resulting in a \\"double- double\\", meaning the wager would be increased by four times. So a wager of $1 for running out would be $2 for tonking out (doubles), and $4 for a double- double. =High count or low count= Some house rules include a provision that a player wins the game automatically if they are dealt a hand count of 49 or 50. Another variation states that 50 is automatic but 49 must be played in turn. This means that if a player goes down before it is the turn of the player who has 49, that player no longer wins. Some house rules include a provision that a player wins the game automatically if dealt a hand count of 13 or under, and is paid double. Some house rules state that a hand of 9 or under is an automatic win and is paid triple. =Only run is a spread= Another house rule states players may add a card from their hand only to tabled runs, not on three of a kind. This rule is attributed to John P. Speno, inspired by writer Glen Cook's The Black Company. =Texas Tonk= The winner is awarded double if: *The winner tonks *A different player comes in (shows their hand claiming to have the lowest) and is beaten by someone with a lower hand. The person with the lowest hand would be paid double by the person who \\"came in.\\" *The winner is dealt 50 on their initial deal The winner is awarded the standard amount if: *The player comes in with the lowest hand *The player is dealt 49 on the initial deal =Spades= Players can bet on who has the highest spade dealt in their opening hand. Players who wish to participate will put their stake in an additional side pot (optional). Each player choosing to participate will reveal their highest spade in the order the cards were dealt. If a player participating in spades does not have a spade, they obviously will not show one, but it is a matter of honor to reveal a spade even if another player has already revealed theirs. If a player chooses not to participate, they do not need to reveal their spade. This creates an extra element of strategy as some players will more than likely be required to reveal a portion of their hand.

He is the former general manager of the Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox, and Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball. He is also the founder of the Dan Duquette Sports Academy. He has twice been named the Major League Baseball Executive of the Year by Sporting News (1992 with the Expos and 2014 with the Orioles). Early life and education Duquette is a native of Dalton, Massachusetts. He attended a Catholic grammar school in Dalton during which time he was a batboy for the Wahconah Regional High School baseball team. In high school, he was the captain of both the baseball and football teams. After high school, he attended Amherst College where he was a catcher on the varsity baseball team and a linebacker on the football team. In the summer of 1977 at the age of 19, Duquette helped organize the Dalton Collegians, a semi-pro baseball team that operated out of his hometown. In college, Duquette was chosen to the 1979 Boston Herald American All New England College Division All Star team. Duquette was also known to talk to professional scouts who attended Amherst baseball games. He graduated from college in 1980. Career =Early career and Montreal Expos= Duquette in April 2015 After college, Duquette's baseball coach, Bill Thurston, recommended him to Harry Dalton, a fellow Amherst alumnus and general manager of the Milwaukee Brewers. Duquette became a scouting assistant for the Brewers and worked in the scouting department for seven years. In 1987, the Montreal Expos hired Duquette as the Director of Player Development. He spent a few years in that position before being promoted to Vice President and General Manager in 1991 (taking over for the departing Dave Dombrowski). Over the course of his six years with the Expos, Duquette had a hand in drafting players like Rondell White, Marquis Grissom, Cliff Floyd, Jose Vidro, Kirk Reuter, Javier Vasquez, and many more Major League players. He also signed players like Vladimir Guerrero, John Wetteland, and Larry Walker. In November 1993, Duquette traded second baseman Delino DeShields for Pedro Martínez of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Expos were competitive from 1992 to 1994, and they had attained the best record in baseball prior to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike that ended the season prematurely. =Boston Red Sox= Duquette shaking hands with Toronto Blue Jays players in their dugout prior to a game on July 13, 2013 In 1994, Duquette returned to Massachusetts to become the General Manager of the Boston Red Sox. He spent eight years at the helm of his hometown team. The Red Sox achieved a record of 656–574 under Duquette, setting attendance records and appearing in the playoffs on three separate occasions (1995, 1998, and 1999). The team won the American League East division in 1995, but only advanced as far as the American League Championship Series once in their three postseason years. They would lose that series to the rival New York Yankees. As the Red Sox GM, Duquette made several notable moves, including drafting Nomar Garciaparra in 1994 and trading for Pedro Martínez in 1997 (and signing him to a six-year, $75 million contract). He is also known for letting Roger Clemens leave in free agency in 1996. Many of the players that Duquette drafted or signed were on the Red Sox 2004 World Series championship team. He is largely considered to have laid the groundwork for that team by signing and drafting players like Tim Wakefield, Johnny Damon, Jason Varitek, Manny Ramirez, Derek Lowe, and Kevin Youkilis. In 2002, Duquette was dismissed from his general manager post less than 24 hours after the Red Sox had officially been sold to a new ownership group that included John W. Henry and Tom Werner. =After Boston= The Bet Shemesh Blue Sox in a team huddle in 2007, one of six teams to play in the inaugural season of the Israel Baseball League After his stint with the Red Sox, Duquette largely stayed out of Major League Baseball for 9 years. In 2003, he opened the Dan Duquette Sports Academy, a sports training center in Hinsdale, Massachusetts designed for children aged 8 to 18. In 2004, he became the owner of the New England Collegiate Baseball League's Pittsfield Dukes (later the Pittsfield American Defenders and now the Mystic Schooners). During his ownership tenure, the Dukes/American Defenders played at his sports academy in Hinsdale and later at Wahconah Park in Pittsfield. In 2008, he was part of an ownership group that included Buddy Lewis, Terry Allvord, and Jerry O'Connor that purchased what would become known as the American Defenders of New Hampshire, (later the Pittsfield Colonials). He relinquished ownership of both clubs in 2009 and 2010. Duquette also helped found the Israel Baseball League. Despite folding after only one season, it helped 75 players get into professional baseball. During this time, he also had a part in a production of the musical, Damn Yankees, in Western Massachusetts. =Baltimore Orioles= Duquette (left) with Buck Showalter (middle) and Luke Scott (right) before a game on May 17, 2013 After spending 9 years away from the MLB, Duquette returned as the General Manager of the Baltimore Orioles in November 2011. In 2012, the team made the playoffs for the first time since 1997. In 2014, the Orioles won the American League East with 96 wins and made it to the American League Championship Series. Many people attribute the success of the Orioles to the management of Buck Showalter and Duquette. Duquette signed Nelson Cruz to one-year, $8 million contract in February 2014. Cruz went on to lead the league in home runs that year. Other signings and acquisitions under Duquette have included, Nick Hundley, Delmon Young, Steve Pearce, and Andrew Miller. In early 2015, the Toronto Blue Jays expressed interest in making Duquette their new President/CEO. Because Duquette was under contract until 2018 and the Blue Jays did not offer enough compensation to the Orioles, no deal was struck. On October 3, 2018 the Orioles fired Duquette after two straight losing seasons, in 2018 the Orioles went 47-115, the worst record in franchise history. Both Duquette and Showalter had contracts that expired at the end of the season. Recognition and awards Duquette has twice received The Sporting News Executive of the Year Award (1992 with the Expos and 2014 with the Orioles). He also won the Baseball America Major League Executive of the Year honor in 2014 with the Orioles. Mark Armour and Daniel Levitt ranked Duquette the 17th best general manager in the history of baseball in their 2015 book, In Pursuit of Pennants: Baseball Operations from Deadball to Moneyball. Personal life Duquette is married to Amy Aubry-Duquette and has seven children. He lived in Acton, Massachusetts, from 1994 through 2011. He currently lives in Sandwich, Massachusetts. Duquette's cousin, Jim Duquette, is a former executive of the Baltimore Orioles and the New York Mets. His other cousin, Pat Duquette (Jim's brother), is the head men's basketball coach at UMass Lowell.

Ewell Townview Magnet Center (commonly referred to as TAG or TAG Magnet) is a public college preparatory magnet secondary school located in the Oak Cliff area of Dallas, Texas. The school enrolls students in grades 9-12 and is a part of the Dallas Independent School District. It is known for its liberal arts, Advanced Placement Program and intensive education style. In 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010 Newsweek named the school the #1 public high school in the United States. In 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, U.S. News & World Report named TAG the #1 public high school in the United States. In 2015, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency. History Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Center Seal The School for the Talented and Gifted was established in 1982 as part of a desegregation court order and was originally located in West Dallas on the L.G. Pinkston High School campus. Its curriculum was designed to provide a comprehensive academic program to serve identified talented and gifted students in grades nine through twelve. In the 1990s, the Dallas Independent School District allocated money for a new \\"magnet center\\" as an experiment in accelerated high school education. This magnet center would house six different schools, each offering college-preparatory and pre- professional programs alongside a solid academic education. The TAG Magnet, along with five other magnet schools, moved to the new Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Magnet Center in the fall of 1995. Initially, TAG students were taught alongside the students at the other magnet schools, TAG instruction was cut from seven classes to three, and TAG teachers from thirteen to four. After a TAG protest that included petitions, letters to the newspaper, pleas to the school board, and walk-outs, TAG was given an increased number of self- contained classes and permission to have its own teaching staff specialized in teaching talented and gifted students. Campus Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Magnet Center, which houses this school The School for the Talented and Gifted is housed in the south section on the third floor of the Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Magnet Center. Students During the spring semester a screening process is initiated to place incoming students drawn from across the Dallas Independent School District at the TAG Magnet for the following year. A holistic, case-study approach is used by the screening committee, which is composed of the principal, the counselor, teachers, and community representatives. Multiple identification criteria are used in the screening process including academic transcripts, TAKS/ITBS scores, a behavioral assessment, student portfolio, and anecdotal information. Careful attention is paid to pre-established guidelines to ensure that the student population is ethnically balanced. In the 2010–2011 school year there were 240 students enrolled, and the racial/ethnic makeup reflected the culturally diverse fabric of the larger school district as best as it could following the desegregation rulings of Judge Barefoot Sanders that required \\"improved programs for minority students and hiring goals for minority faculty and administration staff\\". The student population was 10.8% Asian/Pacific Islander, 16.7% Black, 30.0% Hispanic, and 42.5% White. The school's gender makeup was not reflective of the larger school district, with 35% boys and 65% girls. The attendance rate for students at the school is 97.6%, compared with a state average of 95.5%. Of the 201 students at TAG 28.9% are economically disadvantaged, 0% enroll in special education, 100% enroll in gifted and talent programs, and 0% are considered \\"limited English proficient\\". The average class sizes at TAG used to be 14.8 students for English, 5.2 for foreign language, 13.7 for math, 16.4 for science, and 16.8 for social studies but have since increased to about 20. Faculty During the 2006–2007 school year the TAG faculty consisted of 17 teachers with an average of 18.2 years of teaching experience and 11.9 years of experience teaching in DISD. Of those teachers, 1.1% are beginning teachers, 18.6% have 1–5 years of experience, 24.1% have 6–10 years of experience, 20.6% have 11–20 years of experience and 35.6% have more than 20 years of experience.Texas Education Agency - AEIS Report - 1. select AEIS report. 2. select HTML or PDF 3. select Campus Number 4.

The school then takes that program and makes it more demanding by including the Pre-AP and AP curriculum. =English curriculum = A typical TAG student takes English 1 Pre-AP as a freshman, English 2 Pre-AP as a sophomore, AP English Language and Composition as a junior, and AP English Literature and Composition as a senior. The Texas Education Agency mandated that all TAG students in Texas must submit an “Exit- Level Project” during their senior year. This project requires finding a mentor in the community, researching and developing the project, and submitting the finished project to a set of judges at the state level. The projects are graded on a “1” to “5” scale, with “5” being the highest. The student must score a “3” or higher to graduate with a “TAG” endorsement on their diploma. TAG's Independent Study English course is this exit-level project. In addition to the required courses, students have choices of the following electives: Debate and Humanities (World Studies/Philosophy). Since there is a selection process used to gain admission to the TAG Magnet; and, since one of the definitions of a TAG student is a national-norm reading score of “80” or higher, the school does not have students who read below grade level. However, since TAG requires an AP course (AP Human Geography) as freshman, the school does have students who do not read well enough to tackle a college-level course in their first year of high school. These students are referred to the Student Support Team (SST) for review. This leads to a parent- teacher-student conference attended by both the counselor and the principal. Parent, student, and teacher agree to work together as they check on progress achieved through tutoring before and after school. In some cases, additional projects are assigned to improve reading skills. =Math curriculum= Because the TAG admissions process is selective- one of the definitions of a TAG student is a national-norm math score of “82” or higher- a TAG student enters the school having already taken Algebra. Typically, the majority of the class takes Geometry their freshman year. As an effect, students take Algebra 2 Pre- AP as sophomores, Pre-Calculus and AP Statistics as juniors, and AP Calculus AB as seniors. Students who enter the school without Algebra I credits will take both Algebra I and Geometry Pre-AP as freshman and then follow the aforementioned track until their senior year. If a student who has had both Algebra I and Geometry in their 7th and 8th grade years begins their math curriculum at TAG with Algebra II, they continue on to take Pre-Calculus as a sophomore, AP Calculus AB and AP Statistics as a junior, and AP Calculus BC as a senior. Other students choose to \\"fast track\\" their math courses taking Algebra 2 Pre-AP and Pre-Calculus Pre-AP as sophomores thus allowing them to take AP Calculus BC as seniors. The school does allow those advanced students to do take an elective called independent study in math, which teaches number theory and linear algebra, as well as other topics they will encounter at the university level.

Traditions Integral to the TAG environment, traditions play a major role in school spirit. There are many traditions at the Talented and Gifted magnet, some are student traditions, such as Arts Week, ICAP, and Scrapbook, and some are school traditions such as TAG-IT, TREK, and TAG Forum. =Scrapbook= Scrapbook is a yearly tradition in which the senior class collectively pulls together a scrapbook of events throughout the year, and before graduation, publishes a copy for all the seniors and sells copies to any underclassman that wants one. The scrapbook is officially a collective publication of the members of the Senior Class and expresses their opinions and memories of the school.

He studied at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts of Brussels and the Ecole National des Beaux-Arts in Paris (in the studio of Fernand Cormon), where he followed the steps of Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec. During World War I, Massonet served as a stretcher-bearer for the Belgian Army while working for the art section of the Army, capturing scenes of war and devastation throughout Belgium. He published an art and literary paper called Le Claque à Fond while on the front line. After the war, he taught drawing in different schools and academies of Brussels while publishing books and articles on art and sketch techniques. He worked with different artists and writers of the time, such as Victor Horta, René Lyr and Victor Boin. After World War II he moved to Paris, where he painted regularly and continued to publish books on art and painting. There he became acquainted with painters such as Vlaminck. Massonet's work demonstrates a particular skill for sketching and capturing movement and light. As a painter, he produced numerous portraits and views of cities (Brussels, Paris, Venice) as well as interior scenes. His paintings also developed the theme of music and dance, portraying jazz bands and piano players. He produced numerous posters and publicity drawings for companies such as Philips and Agfa-Gevaert. His work can be found in museums in Brussels, Belgium; Rheims, France; and Riga, Latvia.

Stawiski is the administrative seat of Gmina Stawiski. From 1946 to 1975 it belonged administratively to Białystok Voivodeship, and from 1975 to 1998 to Łomża Voivodeship. The town is situated on the Dzierzbia River. According to Central Statistical Office (Poland), the population of Stawiski as of 31 December 2008 was 2,417 persons. History Stawiski was established in 1407–1411. It received city rights around 1688. The Franciscan Order built a monastery there in 1791. The monks were expelled from Stawiski in 1867 during the Partitions, as punishment for supporting the Polish January Uprising against the Russian imperial rule. The town was destroyed by fire in 1812 in the course of the French campaign against Russia, and rebuilt again, to become trades and commercial centre known for its furs, fabrics and hats in Congress Poland. Stawiski was burned to the ground once more during the Russian–Prussian war of 1915, soon before the re-establishment of the sovereign Republic of Poland. The Polish army fought a battle with the Bolsheviks there in July 1920 during the Polish-Soviet War.Oficjalna strona miasta Stawiski. =Jewish community= Aerial photo of Stawiski from the period of World War II. In the background, the church of St. Antoni Padewski and the Great Synagogue. Jewish life in Stawiski had been separate from that of the rest of the town's inhabitants. The Jews had established many institutions of their own, including synagogues and Jewish schools and libraries. By 1932, over 50% of Stawiski's population, some 2,000 persons, was Jewish. During the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, Stawiski was initially occupied by Germany. During the month-long German occupation, German soldiers raped Jewish women and plundered Jewish property. Some Poles who had been ordered to supervise Jewish labor brigades humiliated the conscripted workers. After a Stawiski priest blamed the Jews for the murder of some German soldiers, the Germans executed several Jews, burned down the small synagogue or perhaps a bet midrash, and set fire to part of the town. The Germans deported a group of able-bodied male Jews (and Christians) to forced labor camps in East Prussia. After some three weeks, the Germans passed control of Stawiski to Soviet forces. Soviet rule lasted until the Germans returned to the town in June 1941 during Operation Barbarossa. Local Poles welcomed the arriving Germans with flowers, and German army scouts who arrived on 27 June noted the Poles' hatred for the Jews. Local Poles, mostly recently released from Soviet prisons, asked German permission to take revenge on the Jews and killed some 70 of them. In early July 1941 the Germans instigated a pogrom in which Polish mobs armed with iron bars murdered some 300 Jews. Some Poles were motivated by revenge against earlier Soviet supporters. A German Einsatzkommando was present in the town during 4–5 July 1941.. A similar, better known, atrocity took place on 10 July 1941 in nearby Jedwabne. Beginning on 17 August 1941, the Germans executed most of Stawiski's Jewish community. Some 900 able-bodied Jews were killed in a ditch near Mątwica, where Jewish women and children from Kolno and Jews from Mały Płock were also executed. Some 700 persons, mostly infants, the elderly, and the handicapped, were killed in Płaszczatka (or Stawiski) Forest. Some 60 to 105 Jews remained, mainly skilled workers and their families, who were confined to a ghetto. Some Jews from Stawiski who survived in hiding sought refuge in the Łomża Ghetto, others remained hidden until permitted by the Germans to work as farm laborers. On 2 November 1942 the ghetto was closed and its occupants were transferred to a transit camp in Bogusze, and from there were sent to the Auschwitz and Treblinka extermination camps. Some 50 Stawiski Jews managed to evade deportation, but most of them were found and executed in subsequent searches. Some of the hiding Jews were denounced by Poles, and at least 11 of them were murdered by local Poles in nearby Mały Płock gmina. Only a few of the 2,000 pre-war Jewish inhabitants of Stawiski survived the Holocaust. Some of the Stawiski Jews murdered during the war are buried in a mass grave at the .

Economy The main branch of local economy is agriculture, based on individual arable farms producing crops for local processing as well as raising farm animals for the market. Apart from farming, trade and service industries cover the needs of the inhabitants. The overall number of people employed in the gmina's economy is 3,545. The breakdown of main employment sectors is as follows. Farming and forestry: 2,304. Industry: 177. Trade and services: 727. Education, health services: 288. Administration and policing: 35. The town's revenue in 2003 (including its surroundings) amounted 4.299 mln zloty. Net income was 900,000 zloty. However, expenses of the commune exceeded its profits in that period, and amounted to 4.679 mln zloty. Gross revenue and net profits fluctuate depending on expenditures in the public sector, such as environmental protection, water management, dump disposal, sewers, etc. Notable residents Stawiski is the hometown of the famous chess player Akiba Rubinstein. In the main square, there is a monument to Stanisław Steczkowski Zagończyk, who, together with his four brothers, fought in the underground Polish Home Army in 1942–1945.

History It was founded on 17 January 1963, in the Spanish island of Mallorca, by Father Jaime Bonet. The community was ecclesiastically approved as a new form of Consecrated Life of pontifical right, by Pope John Paul II on 15 April 2000. According to the constitutions endorsed on that date their mission is to announce the Word of God and to propagate the Kingdom of God through prayer, the ministry of the Word, and the testimony of evangelical life. The community consists of consecrated women, consecrated men (brothers and priests), and consecrated married couples according to their state. The name, Verbum Dei, is Latin for \\"Word of God\\". The mission of the VDMF is to promote the greatest dignity for all people by empowering individuals and communities to partake in the journey of Christian discipleship. This discipleship is forged in a spirituality rooted in Scripture and Catholic tradition that leads to witnessing to universal fratarnety made visible through community. All celibate members of the community go through several years of academic study of philosophy and theology as that which takes place in a Catholic priestly seminary. The daily life of a missionary involves several hours of silent contemplative prayer.

Highpoint Shopping Centre is a super regional shopping centre located in Maribyrnong, Victoria, in the western suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. Highpoint is Victoria's third largest shopping centre and the sixth largest in Australia, with an annual turnover of $778 million and over 15 million shoppers visiting each year. It is the largest shopping centre serving Melbourne's western and north western suburbs, an area with a population of at least half a million people.  History  Highpoint is built on a hill which looks out over the Maribyrnong River to Melbourne's CBD, hence its name. An anti-aircraft battery operated on the site during World War II for protection of the surrounding military bases and ammunition works in Maidstone and Maribyrnong. The 50-acre site was previously a quarry, as can be seen by the quarry cliff face walls of the lower carparks. The land was sold by the City of Essendon for $1.85 million in April 1971, with permission required also from the City of Sunshine as the quarry was also located in that local government area. Highpoint West opened in September 1975. Built by Development Underwriting Ltd. for $12,000,000.http://www.starweekly.com.au/classifieds/from-the-archives/ Named originally \\"Westland\\" to fit in with other shopping centres, Northland, etc., it opened as \\"Highpoint West\\". It was later renamed \\"Highpoint City\\", and then just \\"Highpoint\\". =Redevelopment 2011 - 2013 = The most recent rounds of expansion and redevelopment occurred in two stages, commencing in March 2011. An additional 30,000 m² was added including the first David Jones department store in Melbourne's western suburbs. Expansions, over two levels, incorporated traffic flow improvements, an additional 1,000 car spaces and 100 extra speciality retailers. The first stage of the redevelopment opened 18 October 2012 included a new Woolworths as well as a Fresh Food Market, and an improved car park with \\"Park Assist\\" technology. The second stage opened on 14 March 2013 including the David Jones store over two levels, an Apple Store, Australia's 2nd Samsung Experience store, a Topshop clothing store (now closed and replaced by Uniqlo) and a Zara clothing store along with 98 specialty stores and an extra 1,000 car spaces. One of the redevelopments aims was to improve the centre's sustainability.  Ownership  Until 2006, Highpoint was wholly owned by Melbourne's Besen family (also owners of the Sussan retail chain).

The short was originally produced as part of a 1962 pilot for a television series, Adventures of the Road Runner. After the pilot was not picked up, it was split into three shorts and released theatrically. The other two shorts were Road Runner a Go-Go and Zip Zip Hooray!

Coyote reading a \\"Western Cookery\\" recipe book in total peace. Completely unaware that his prey has zoomed up behind him to sneak a peek at his book, he slurps at the prospect, then finds himself nose-to-beak with the Road Runner. Enraged by the bird, the coyote tries a number of strategies to catch the creature. He tries a lasso, and ends up hit by a rock; he tries chasing the bird at supersonic speed and falls off a bridge and a cactus falls on him; he tries shooting himself toward the bird with a giant spring; and he tries to drop a wrecking ball on the Road Runner with a crane. Finally, he attempts to flatten the Road Runner with a boulder hurled by a catapult. Unfortunately for Wile E., the catapult finds multiple ways to malfunction, resulting in the Coyote getting pancaked each time. The camera zooms in towards the manufacturer's nameplate and reveals that the catapult had been built, not by ACME, but by the \\"Road-Runner Manufacturing Company — Phoenix * Taos * Santa Fe * Flagstaff.\\" The Road Runner on the nameplate then comes to life, gives the audience a \\"Beep-Beep\\" and then zooms off.

The station is owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications, as part of a duopoly with Green Valley-licensed Univision owned-and-operated station KUVE-DT (channel 46). The two stations share studios on Forbes Boulevard in Tucson; KFTU-DT's transmitter is located on Juniper Flats Road northwest of Bisbee. KFTU-CD, virtual channel 34 (UHF digital channel 18), is a low-power Class A television station licensed to Tucson that rebroadcasts KFTU-DT's signal to the city, as KFTU-DT's coverage area falls well short of Tucson proper. KFTU-DT is also rebroadcast on KUVE-DT's second digital subchannel in order to reach the entire market; this signal can be seen on UHF channel 34.2 (or virtual channel 46.2 via PSIP) from a transmitter atop Mount Bigelow. Likewise, KUVE-DT is rebroadcast on KFTU-DT's second digital subchannel. Master control and most internal operations for KFTU-DT and KUVE-DT are based at the facilities of sister station KTVW-DT on 30th Street in southern Phoenix. Like its sister station KFPH-DT (channel 13) in Flagstaff, KFTU-DT brands itself as UniMás Arizona. On cable, the station is available on Cox Communications channel 60. History =KFTU-DT= The station was granted its original construction permit on April 8, 1998, and took the call letters KBGF in June 1998. Initially owned by Winstar Broadcasting Corp. of New York City, it was sold in December 1999 to Douglas Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Equity Broadcasting of Little Rock, Arkansas. Douglas Broadcasting completed building the station and filed for a license to cover the construction permit in April 2001. At the same time, they took KBGF on the air under Program Test Authority as an independent station. In October 2001, Douglas Broadcasting sold the station to Univision, who changed its call letters to KFTU in January 2002 to coincide with the launch of its new network, Telefutura (now UniMás), and added the \\"-TV\\" suffix two years later (after the end of analog broadcasting in June 2009, KFTU and all other Univision-owned stations switched to the \\"-DT\\" suffix). The station obtained its license to cover construction on February 4, 2004, after nearly three years operating under Program Test Authority. =KFTU-CD= KFTU-CD began with an original construction permit granted on August 26, 1991 to Ponyland Broadcasting (later Venture Technologies) for a low-power television station to serve Tucson on UHF channel 25 with the callsign K25EA. Delays building the station caused the permit to lapse and the FCC to delete the callsign in 1993, but the station was restored and came on the air in August 1994, with the initial license granted August 29, 1994. The station changed its callsign to KTAZ-LP (for Tucson, AriZona) on December 18, 1996. In April 2001, Venture Technologies sold the station to Douglas Broadcasting, who, in turn, sold the station to Univision in September 2001. After the Telefutura network launched in January 2002, Univision dropped the station's Home Shopping Network affiliation in favor of its new network. About the same time, KTAZ was granted Class A status, and changed its call letters to KTAZ-CA on March 1, 2002. KTAZ found itself displaced when Fox affiliate KMSB (channel 11) neared launch of its digital television station on UHF channel 25, and in May 2002, applied to move to UHF channel 34. The application was granted in June, and by December 2002, the station was at its new broadcast channel. Univision changed the station's call letters to KFTU-CA on November 6, 2004, establishing brand identity with its principal station in Douglas. The station's call sign was changed again on March 19, 2012, concurrent with its transition to digital broadcasting. The KTAZ call letters would resurface in Phoenix in 2006, when the Telemundo station there began branding itself as Telemundo Arizona. Digital television Because it was granted an original construction permit after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) finalized the DTV allotment plan on April 21, 1997 , the station did not receive a companion channel for a digital television station. Instead, on June 12, 2009, which was the end of the digital TV conversion period for full-service stations, KFTU-TV was required to turn off its analog signal and turn on its digital signal (called a \\"flash-cut\\"). However, since its analog channel position was in the low-VHF range, 2 - 6, KFTU-DT was allowed to select a different channel to use after the conversion. KFTU-DT selected UHF channel 36 and began operations on that channel once the digital transition was complete. KFTU-CD did not apply for a companion channel for the digital conversion; as a low-powered television station, it was exempt from the 2009 analog shutdown. The station began was issued a digital license to cover on March 19, 2012. Defunct translator KFTU-DT previously had another repeater station in Tucson, K48GX (analog channel 48), that provided over-the- air coverage to areas to the northwest of Tucson that are shielded by terrain from the KFTU-CD signal. The station has since been taken off the air, with no FCC information available.

The western portion begins at Tipton at a junction with State Route 99 and heads east towards Porterville before ending at Quaking Aspen in the Sequoia National Forest. The eastern portion begins at US 395 at Olancha, heads east through Death Valley National Park, and ends at State Route 127 at Death Valley Junction. The 43.0-mileCalifornia Department of Transportation, Traversible Highways Report 2002 [sic], accessed January 2008 (69.2 km) portion over the Sierra Nevada remains unconstructed, and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has no plans to build it through the wilderness areas. SR 190 is a National Scenic Byway known as the Death Valley Scenic Byway. Route description State Route 190 begins at State Route 99 just south of downtown Tipton in Tulare County and heads straight east along the flat San Joaquin Valley on Avenue 144. There is a short expressway segment in Porterville, including a cloverleaf interchange at State Route 65 and a partial interchange at Main Street, after which the highway begins to curve alongside the Tule River, passing the south side of Lake Success, as the terrain becomes more rugged. Following the river, it meets the south end of County Route J37, an access road to Balch Park in the Mountain Home State Forest, at the forks of the river near the community of Springville. SR 190 continues east near the Middle Fork and South Fork Middle Fork Tule River to near Camp Nelson, where it begins rising into the foothills, going around many hairpin turns in order to rise to Quaking Aspen, the source of the South Fork Middle Fork and the end of the western segment of SR 190. The county-maintained Western Divide Highway continues south to a point west of Johnsondale, where traffic can turn east to reach US 395 via Sherman Pass and County Route J41.California Department of Transportation District 6, State Route 190 Transportation Concept Report, February 2007, accessed January 2008Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed January 2008 via ACME Mapper From Quaking Aspen across the Sierra Nevada to Olancha, Caltrans has adopted a proposed alignment, but is unlikely to build it, in part due to two protected wilderness areas — the Golden Trout Wilderness and South Sierra Wilderness — along the route. The unconstructed routing heads northeast from Quaking Aspen, cresting a small summit before following Freeman Creek easterly past the Freeman Creek Grove, crossing the Kern River near its forks, and then using the path of Rattlesnake Creek and Beach Creek to the Beach Meadows area. Crossing several ridges to the northeast, SR 190 would make its way to the South Fork Kern River near Monache Mountain, then heading southeast along that waterway to the vicinity of Haiwee Pass. That pass, elevation about 8200 feet (2500 m) above sea level, would take the highway over the Sierra Crest into Inyo County, dropping down the steep Eastern Sierra escarpment for 12.0 miles (19.3 km) in a north- northeasterly direction to US 395 at Olancha (elevation 3650 feet/1100 m).California Department of Transportation District 9, State Route 190 Transportation Concept Report, 2003, accessed January 2008 SR 190 in Panamint Valley The eastern section of SR 190 begins at Olancha in the Owens Valley, at the intersection with US 395. The route heads northeast along the southeast side of Owens Lake to the junction with SR 136 southeast of Keeler, where it turns southeast and east around the south side of the Inyo Mountains. After passing the turnoff to Darwin, SR 190 enters Death Valley National Park and becomes curvier as it heads down into the Panamint Valley. The highway crosses the valley and then turns northeast over Towne Pass and into the northern part of Death Valley at Stovepipe Wells. Within the valley, at the intersection with North Highway, which leads to Scotty's Castle and Beatty, Nevada, SR 190 turns southeast through Death Valley, which it remains inside until the turnoff to Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, near the settlement of Furnace Creek. It leaves the valley to the southeast alongside Furnace Creek Wash, where the highway is usually closed at least once a year by flash floods. SR 190 turns east away from the wash at the turnoff to Dante's View, and soon leaves the park, after which it follows a mostly straight alignment to its end at State Route 127 at Death Valley Junction. The route east of State Route 136 near Keeler is on the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is a two-lane road; but except for a small portion in Porterville is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. Except west of State Route 65 in Porterville, SR 190 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System; the part within Death Valley National Park has been added to the system by the California Department of Transportation, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. This portion is a National Scenic Byway known as the Death Valley Scenic Byway.California Department of Transportation, California Scenic Highway Mapping System: Tulare County and Inyo County, accessed January 2008 History SR 190 shield in Death Valley The path of SR 190 east of the Panamint Range in Death Valley National Park was followed in late 1849 and early 1850 by the Death Valley '49ers, a group of '49ers that had left the Old Spanish Trail at Enterprise, Utah to look for a shortcut to Walker Pass. The pioneers crossed the state line from Nevada near Ash Meadows, following the general route of present SR 190 from Death Valley Junction into Death Valley, which they left to the west into Panamint Valley and then turned south towards present State Route 178.Roger Brandt, National Park Service, The Lost '49ers, accessed January 2008 After ore was discovered in Death Valley, the route became a primitive road,United States Geological Survey, Ballarat 1913 and Furnace Creek 1910 (scale 1:250000) though most travel into the valley, such as the twenty-mule team borax route, was from the south.National Park Service, Death Valley Historic Resource Study: Wingate Wash , March 1981, accessed January 2008 The second boom in Death Valley was tourism, started in the 1920s by Herman Eichbaum. After several failures in getting a toll road approved from Lida, Nevada or over Towne Pass, he scaled back plans to include only the part of the latter route between southeast of Darwin and his resort at Stovepipe Wells. The new Eichbaum Toll Road was certified complete on May 4, 1926, and toll rates were set: $2 per motor vehicle and 50¢ per person. In 1933, the state legislature added many roads to the state highway system, including a new (unsigned) Route 127, connecting Tipton with Baker via Lone Pine and Death Valley Junction.: \\"State Highway Route 31 to Death Valley and connection to California-Nevada State line.\\" \\"State Highway Route 23 near Lone Pine to Death Valley.\\" \\"State Highway Route 4 near Tipton, via Porterville and Camp Nelson to State Highway Route 23 near Lone Pine.\\": \\"Route 127 is from: (a) Route 4 near Tipton via Porterville and Camp Nelson to Route 23 near Lone Pine. (b) Route 23 near Lone Pine to Death Valley. (c) Route 31 to Death Valley.\\" The Death Valley National Monument was created on February 11, 1933, and in December 1934 the Division of Highways paid $25,000 for the 30.35-mile (48.84 km) road, giving the 17 miles (27 km) east of the park boundary at the pass to the National Park Service.National Park Service, Death Valley Historic Resource Study: Stovepipe Wells Hotel, March 1981, accessed January 2008 The state Division of Highways and National Park Service soon paved the route from Lone Pine (on US 395) through Towne Pass and Death Valley to Baker (on US 91).National Park Service, Death Valley Historic Resource Study: Furnace Creek Inn, March 1981, accessed January 2008 The work was completed in October 1937, including the 17.5-mile (18 km) Darwin cutoff that bypassed Darwin and the old toll road west of Panamint Springs.Fitzhugh L. Minnigerodee, The New York Times, Road Joins 'Extremes', October 24, 1937, p. 8 The National Park Service, using Civilian Conservation Corps labor, maintained the road through the park until August 1942, when an 11-mile (18 km) stretch east of the valley was washed out by a storm. At that time, maintenance was given back to the state, which rebuilt the destroyed segment. When the state sign route system was created in 1934, Sign Route 190 was assigned to the portion of Route 127 west of Death Valley Junction, while the remainder to Baker became part of Sign Route 127. However, the highway was not continuous, with the roadway from Tipton (which had been built by Tulare CountyBen Blow, California Highways: A Descriptive Record of Road Development by the State and by Such Counties as Have Paved Highways, 1920 (Archive.org or Internet Archive), pp. 278-279) ending at Quaking Aspen (east of Camp Nelson) and that from Death Valley ending southwest of Lone Pine.Automobile Club of Southern California, Mojave & Colorado Deserts, 1941 In 1923, Tulare County businessmen had begun to push for a new trans-Sierra highway connecting Porterville with Lone Pine,Los Angeles Times, Trail Over Mountains Supported, June 15, 1923, p.

The old route from southeast of Keeler to Lone Pine remained as a branch, and was still signed as SR 190.H.M. Gousha Company, California, 1963 Also in 1959, the original routing from Lone Pine through Death Valley to Baker was added to the proposed California Freeway and Expressway System, though no parts have been upgraded as such.: \\"Route 127 from Route 23 to Route 31 via Death Valley.\\" The east-west piece between Tipton and Death Valley Junction legislatively received the State Route 190 designation in the 1964 renumbering, and the north–south part became State Route 127, as it had been signed; the branch to Lone Pine became a new State Route 136.: \\"Route 190 is from Route 99 near Tipton to Route 127 near Death Valley Junction via the vicinity of Porterville, Camp Nelson, Olancha, and Death Valley.\\" By the mid-1970s, the environmental movement had essentially killed the planned connection, and the designation of the Golden Trout Wilderness in 1978 and South Sierra Wilderness in 1984 were the final blow, though Caltrans still has an officially adopted alignment designated over Haiwee Pass.

Store Formats JB Hi-Fi stores are electronics and small appliances stores, which is the largest store format by store numbers. JB Hi-Fi Home stores are similar to JB Hi-Fi stores, selling electronics and small appliances, although JB Hi- Fi Home stores are larger than traditional stores, and sell large appliances, such as fridges, washing machines, dryers and dishwashers etc. The concept was first tried in late 2012, with some existing stores being converted to JB Hi- Fi Home stores. JB Hi-Fi Express stores is a concept store launched in October 2019, as a smaller version of the traditional JB Hi-Fi store, with a focus on mobile products, and less focus on appliances, computers or televisions. The first store opened in Southbank, Victoria. Acquisitions In July 2004, JB Hi-Fi bought 70% of the Clive Anthonys chain in Queensland. On 13 December 2006, JB Hi-Fi acquired the Hill and Stewart chain of 11 electronics stores selling and operating in New Zealand for NZ$17.5 million (A$15.3 million). JB Hi-Fi later established stores under their own JB Hi-Fi brand, and closed all Hill and Stewart stores in 2010. In September 2016, JB Hi-Fi announced its acquisition of The Good Guys, for $870 million, the acquisition resulted in JB Hi-Fi group enlarging its share of the Australian home appliances retail market to 29% and growing its share of the consumer electronics retail market to 24%. Controversies In September 2015, a man with Down Syndrome was refused entry into a JB Hi-Fi store in Brisbane, Australia, after being confused for another person who had been banned from the store. The resulting media attention resulted in the CEO Richard Murray publicly apologizing to the family.

Uses The auditorium is the official venue of the local basketball team, the Leones de Ponce, and also hosts musical concerts, circuses, conventions, and organization meetings. In addition to serving as an important sports venue, several non-sports historical events have taken place there. The tumultuous General Assembly of the then-ruling New Progressive Party held there in 1983 led to the creation of a splinter party, the Puerto Rico Renewal Party, by then San Juan mayor Hernán Padilla and the defeat of Governor Carlos Romero Barceló in the 1984 gubernatorial elections. The auditorium was the site of the wake ceremony for Juan \\"Pachín\\" Vicéns who died on 18 February 2007. The wake ceremony for Ponce mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago who died on 17 January 2004 was also held there as well. Controversy In April 2011, the 2012 PPD Ponce mayoral candidate Ramón Torres Morales, criticized the incumbent opposition PNP party mayor María Meléndez for placing a plaque on the bust that former PPD mayor Churumba had erected at the entrance to the Juan Pachins Vicens auditorium to commemorate the basketball legend. The plaque bore the name of PNP mayor, María Meléndez, instead of the PPD mayor who had erected the commemorative bust, mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago, a.k.a.

Military career Born in County Kilkenny, Ireland, Charles Houghton was commissioned into the 57th Foot without purchase in 1855. In 1856 he was promoted lieutenant without purchase, and in 1858 he transferred into the 5th Foot; a month later he transferred into the 20th Foot. In 1861 he purchased a Captaincy. In 1863 he retired from the Army and emigrated to British Columbia, Canada, settling in the Okanagan valley. Through a military land grant, he established Coldstream Ranch that year, later transferring title to fellow officers Forbes George Vernon and Charles Albert Vernon. Political career In 1865 and 1866, he led expeditions to explore the Gold Range through to the Columbia River mines. In 1866, he was appointed justice of the peace. After British Columbia entered confederation he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Yale District in 1871. After being promoted to lieutenant-colonel, he was appointed deputy adjutant-general of the militia for Military District No.11 (British Columbia) in 1873.

She served as the Minister of Education and Research from 2002 to 2003, 2005 to 2007 and since 2016. Early life and education Reps was born in Tallinn, Estonia. From 1993 to 1998 she studied law at the Academy Nord in Tallinn. She holds currently two Master degrees: the first in law from the Central European University and the second in public relations from Maastricht University. Since 2001 she is studying international and European law at doctorate level in Uppsala University. From 2000 to 2001 Mailis Rand worked in the European Commission Directorate-General of Personnel and Administration. Since year 2000 she is also a lecturer of international public law in the Academy Nord and in the Riga Graduate School of Law. Political career On 28 January 2002 Mailis Rand became the Estonian Minister of Education in the government of Siim Kallas. She was often criticised for her youth and inexperience. Although she was unable to solve several crucial problems of Estonian education, she fought for more funding to education and was elected Friend of Education by Estonian Education Forum in October 2002. Mailis Rand renamed the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Education and Research (in effect since 1 January 2003) to reflect the central role of this government institution in administration of higher education and research activities. She was also the Minister to merge two leading academic libraries of Estonia – Estonian Academic Library and Tallinn Pedagogical University Library. The merger was signed on 8 April 2003, 2 days before the resignation of the government. Mailis Rand became then member of the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu). She was also elected to the Board of the Estonian Centre Party and appointed the Party's Secretary on Foreign Relations. She was one of the persons involved in preparing the controversial contract of co-operation between the Estonian Centre Party and Russian 'party of the power' United Russia in December 2004. After the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Juhan Parts she was appointed again Minister of Education and Research on 13 April 2005. Main activities of her second term have been preparation of the new general curriculum, approval of the new vocational education agenda, improving and expanding learning in Estonian in the schools of Russian-speaking minority, provision of free lunches to pupils and approval of the new vocational standard for teachers. Since 2005 she is also a Vice-Chairperson of the Estonian Centre Party. =Member of PACE= As member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), Reps serves as full member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights (as Second Vice-Chairperson); the Committee on the Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights; the Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by Member States of the Council of Europe (Monitoring Committee); and the Sub-Committee on Human Rights. In late September 2014, she and fellow parliamentarian Marietta de Pourbaix-Lundin of Sweden assessed the reform agenda initiated by President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine, reviewed the state of the armed insurgency in the east of Ukraine, and evaluated ethnic tensions in Odessa following the fire of 2 May.Information note by the co-rapporteurs on their fact-finding visit to Kyiv and Odessa (7 to 11 July 2014) Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, press release of 20 March 2015. Alongside Jean-Claude Mignon of France, she is currently co-rapporteur on the honouring of obligations and commitments by Ukraine.PACE monitoring co-rapporteurs to visit Ukraine Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, press release of 20 March 2015. Controversy Mailis Reps was heavily criticised after her official visit to the Mari-El Republic, a federal subject of Russia in August 2005. While several European (including Estonian) politicians have drawn attention to the discrimination of Mari people in this republic and issued statements on the topic, Mailis Reps spoke very positively about the current state of native inhabitants, their culture and education in her interview to Russian television. She later claimed that her statements were taken out of context by Russian TV and that her poor knowledge of Russian contributed to misunderstanding what she had actually meant. Personal life After marrying a Latvian lawyer Agris Repšs she started to use a simplified version of her husband's surname (Reps). The marriage produced six children before divorce was announced in February 2019.

It is a type of Japanese stoneware recognized by its freely-applied glaze as well as its dramatic visual departure from the more somber, monochrome shapes and vessels common in Raku ware of the time. The ceramics were often asymmetrical, embracing the eccentricity of randomized shapes. Deformed shapes were not at all uncommon. These shapes were achieved through the implementation of moulding as a technique, as opposed to working on a potter’s wheel. Sometimes, bowls were so deformed that they became difficult to use – whisking tea could even become a difficult task. History =Origins= Throughout the late Momoyama (1573–1615) and early Edo periods (1615–1868) in Japan, the art of the Japanese tea ceremony underwent new developments. Great tea masters such as Takeno Jōō (1502-1555), Sen no Rikyū (1522-1591), and Furuta Oribe (1544–1615) revolutionized the utensils, rituals, and ceramics used in tea ceremonies. As time passed, technology improved, and kilns advanced; improved firing conditions allowed the creation of Oribe ware, a new kind of ceramic used in these tea ceremonies. =Scholarly disagreement= Scholars tend to disagree over great tea master Furuta Oribe’s link to Oribe ware. Furuta Oribe was recognized as a disciple of Sen no Rikyū, another extremely important and influential tea master. Some researchers state plainly that Oribe was produced under Furuta Oribe’s guidance. Others argue that Oribe ware may not have even been introduced during Furuta Oribe’s lifetime, and therefore has been falsely attributed to him. Still others suggest that we should treat the connection between the two as a coincidence in history – that they happened to coexist at the same time, and this has influenced our perceptions of Oribe ware today. The Museum of Furuta Oribe in Kyoto opened in 2014 and exhibits a number of Oribe wares. There is also some disagreement over how to classify the many distinct types of Oribe ware, and where to draw the line in categorizing them. Some sources state that there are at least eight varieties of Oribe wares, but that they “need not be taken too seriously,” granting some leniency in how we categorize them. Other sources list many more types and varieties. This article offers a general overview of some of the most common categories of Oribe ware, which appear repeatedly across most sources. =Modern revival= Some of the most notable modern artists specializing in Oribe ware are Yasuo Tamaoki (b. 1941) and Osamu Suzuki (b. 1934; 鈴木藏), who was designated a Living National Treasure in 1994. Other notable Oribe ware artists are Suzuki Goro (b. 1941; 鈴木五郎)Suzuki Goro Retrieved 2018-04-30.Oribe goes to LA Retrieved 2018-04-30. and Shigeru Koyama.Guide to oribe ware Retrieved 2018-04-30. Characteristics The designs on most Oribe ware are richly colored, with blue, green, and copper glazes appearing most often. The deformed shapes of these ceramics are central to their aesthetic. Oftentimes, Oribe includes a lustrous hand-drawn iron- glaze designs in certain shapes or patterns. Common motifs within these patterns and drawings include scenes from nature, such as plants or ponds. Utensils of Oribe ware are incredibly varied: common types include bowls, plates, incense burners, dishes, tea caddies, vases, and countless other vessels used in traditional tea ceremonies. The revolutionary colors, shapes, and methods used in Oribe ceramics represent a noteworthy venture into modernity within the tea ceremony. According to some authors, the style was strikingly short-lived, yet managed to make a lasting impact on Japanese ceramics style and history. Example of Oribe style glaze. Exhibited in Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum. Different types of glazes and patterns developed have included: *Green Oribe (青織部, Ao-Oribe), a ceramic with classical green glaze and underglaze painting. Green is the typical colour of Oribe ware, along with white. The original Chinese green was a smooth, even colour like celadon. Oribe, however, tried to use different shades of more natural green, in order to reflect green mountains or riverside scenes. The surface is painted and decorated with lively surface designs, which may be based on nature, geometric patterns, or a combination of the two. For the brilliant green color, wares are fired using oxidation at 1220 degrees Celsius. *Black Oribe (黒織部, Kuro-Oribe), black glazed ceramics with unglazed spots, sometimes decorated with paintings *Shino-Oribe (志野織部) was originally the precursor to Shino ware, which, unlike old Shino ceramics, is fired in modern multi-chamber hangers There is much variation in the type of ware as well as the surface treatment in Oribe pottery. Like many types of Japanese pottery, bowls and dishes are common. Oribe wares also include lidded jars and handled food containers. Many Japanese chefs still use Oribe green for their cuisine. Kilns Numerous kiln sites, scattered throughout Mino, have been identified as areas where Oribe was produced. The creation of the multi-chambered climbing kiln, noborigama, allowed potters to come up with new and innovative ways of glazing. This kind of kiln was introduced from northern Kyushu by Korean potters in the late sixteenth century; the kiln allowed for an important change in traditional methods of firing and glazing. The very first kiln which produced Oribe is believed to have been the Motoyashiki kiln. With the introduction of the new multi-chambered kilns, the less efficient, less dependable kilns which had been firing Shino wares slowly fell out of favor. The newer and larger kilns gave potters the potential to fire at much higher temperatures, which allowed reliable and even maturation of the glaze, resulting in that lustrous shine characteristic of Oribe. The new design also allowed for more effective firing in terms of space; more wares were required to fill a kiln, and this more potters must have been working in each area. The multi-faceted shapes unique to Oribe were created through molding the clay instead of by working on a potter’s wheel. Varieties The all-encompassing umbrella term of “Mino pottery” includes Shino, Oribe, Yellow Seto, Seto Black, and Mino Iga wares. These five types are differentiated by the process of glaze development for each. Despite these identifying factors, many researchers claim that differentiating these types of ceramics is extremely difficult, and often based solely on aesthetic criteria. There is much variation in the type of ware as well as the surface treatment in Oribe pottery. There are so many forms of Oribe that it is incredibly difficult to identify them all, especially when sources vary in their categorization of Oribe; however, the most popular forms which appear across a majority of sources are Green, Monochrome, Narumi, Red, Black, Shino, and Oribe Black. =Green Oribe (青織部, Ao-Oribe)= Green Oribe is traditionally recognized by its distinctive green copper glaze, as well as the purposefully asymmetrical shapes. This kind of Oribe came from the Yashichida kiln in the Okaya group. Many consider this to be the most popular form of Oribe ware; it is highly recognizable from its fresh colored green glaze and contrasting white backgrounds. The glaze is not applied with a brush but with a pouring or ladling technique, resulting in a freely-applied look and feel. The distinct green color is a result of the copper-sulfate glaze, combined with oxidation firing. Common motifs include scenes from nature, such as flowers, rivers, and plants.

Monochrome Oribe may be unadorned, but can also include small patterns or geometrical designs. These designs are often incised and are kept simple. Because this category of Oribe is often entirely coated in the recognizable green glaze, it is sometimes more easily categorized than other forms.

The clay is normally white and red, mixed and intermingling on a single piece to create what some scholars consider to be the most colorful type of Oribe. Designs can also include red or brown colors in moderation. Texture is often introduced in design and sometimes even by creating small imprints on the actual vessel, giving a multidimensional appearance.

The red clay from Narumi Oribe is used as the base for these vessels, creating a generally reddish body, and designs are often more muted than other types of Oribe. Some art historians praise these pieces as striking the “perfect balance between liveliness and refinement.” Oftentimes, this type of Oribe features designs also done in white slip. Generally, there is no green glaze found on this category of Oribe ware.

To achieve this appearance, potters take the ceramics from the kiln and rapidly cool them, resulting in a very lustrous black glaze- a simple yet effective method. Tea bowls are commonly Oribe black, and often these tea bowls are in the “shoe” shape - the intentionally misshapen vessel - characteristic of Oribe ware. File:MET 93 1 49 O.jpegClay covered with a thick, speckled glaze, 18th century = Black Oribe (黒織部, kuro-Oribe) = Black Oribe can be distinguished from Oribe Black in that Black Oribe features designs and white coloring. Many argue that this Oribe is easily and oftentimes confused with Black Seto, as the glazes are rather similar. Dark glaze is applied using a typical pouring or trailing method, but parts of the bowl may be left untouched. Then these empty areas are decorated with black iron wash, creating a beautiful contrast. Some scholars prefer to reference this kind of Oribe as black with decorations in some areas, as opposed to Oribe Black, which is generally all black in appearance and unadorned.

Because of this, this ware is somewhat of a blend between Shino and Oribe, and bears characteristics from both wares. The techniques applied to these wares was reminiscent of Shino tradition, such as typical Shino designs; at the same time, stylistically, these wares included aspects also seen in Green Oribe wares, such as sharp and distinct iron-wash coloring. Often the glaze applied on Shino Oribe is much more thinly applied. Most importantly, this type of Oribe ware is distinct from Shino ware in that it lacks the red coloring of traditional Shino ware, instead favoring white glaze.

Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage. Mastery learning methods suggest that the focus of instruction should be the time required for different students to learn the same material and achieve the same level of mastery. This is very much in contrast with classic models of teaching, which focus more on differences in students' ability and where all students are given approximately the same amount of time to learn and the same set of instructions. In mastery learning, there is a shift in responsibilities, so that student's failure is more due to the instruction and not necessarily lack of ability on his or her part. Therefore, in a mastery learning environment, the challenge becomes providing enough time and employing instructional strategies so that all students can achieve the same level of learning. Definition Mastery learning is a set of group- based, individualized, teaching and learning strategies based on the premise that students will achieve a high level of understanding in a given domain if they are given enough time. =Motivation= The motivation for mastery learning comes from trying to reduce achievement gaps for students in average school classrooms. During the 1960s John B. Carroll and Benjamin S. Bloom pointed out that, if students are normally distributed with respect to aptitude for a subject and if they are provided uniform instruction (in terms of quality and learning time), then achievement level at completion of the subject is also expected to be normally distributed. This can be illustrated as shown below: Comparison between normal curve for aptitude and normal curve for achievement after learning Mastery Learning approaches propose that, if each learner were to receive optimal quality of instruction and as much learning time as they require, then a majority of students could be expected to attain mastery. This situation would be represented as follows: Comparison between normal curve for aptitude and normal curve for achievement after optimal learning In many situations educators preemptively use the normal curve for grading students. Bloom was critical of this usage, condemning it because it creates expectation by the teachers that some students will naturally be successful while others will not. Bloom defended that, if educators are effective, the distribution of achievement could and should be very different from the normal curve. Bloom proposed Mastery Learning as a way to address this. He believed that by using his approach, the majority of students (more than 90 percent) would achieve successful and rewarding learning. As an added advantage, Mastery Learning was also thought to create more positive interest and attitude towards the subject learned if compared with usual classroom methods. =Related terms= Individualized instruction has some elements in common with mastery learning, although it dispenses with group activities in favor of allowing more capable or more motivated students to progress ahead of others while maximizing teacher interaction with those students who need the most assistance. Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem is an educational phenomenon observed where the average student tutored one-to-one (using mastery learning techniques) performed two standard deviations better than students who learn via conventional instructional methods. More recently, the idea of \\"Flipped Mastery\\" gained some popularity. The term was coined by Jon Bergmann and Aaron Sams, both chemistry teachers. They suggest an implementation model for Mastery Learning that is mixed with flipped classroom. The idea is to use technology to time-shift the individual instruction and eliminate whole-class lectures. The students watch online lectures and move through the content at their own pace. In this way technology frees up the teachers to individualize the learning for each student. History The idea of learning for mastery is not new. In the 1920s there were at least two attempts to produce mastery in students' learning: the Winnetka Plan, by Carleton Washburne and associates, and another approach by Henry C. Morrison, at the University of Chicago Laboratory School. Both these projects provided school situations where mastery of particular learning tasks - rather than time spent - was the central theme. While these ideas were popular for a while, they faded due primarily to the lack of technologies that could sustain a successful implementation. The idea of mastery learning resurfaced in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a corollary of programmed instruction, a technology invented by B.F. Skinner to improve teaching. Underlying programmed instruction was the idea that the learning of any behavior, no matter how complex, rested upon the learning of a sequence of less-complex component behaviors. Around that same time, John B. Carroll was working on his \\"Model of School Learning\\". This was a conceptual paradigm which outlined the major factors influencing student success in school learning, indicating also how these factors interacted. Carroll's model stemmed from his previous work with foreign language learning. He found that a student's aptitude for a language predicted not only the level to which he learned in a given time, but also the amount of time he required to learn to a given level. Carroll then suggests that aptitudes are actually a way to measure the amount of time required to learn a task up to a certain level (under ideal instructional conditions). So Carroll's model is actually suggesting that, if each student was allowed the time they needed to learn to some level, then he could be expected to attain that level. Later in the 1960s Benjamin Bloom and his graduate students were researching individual differences in school learning. They observed that teachers displayed very little variation in their instructional practices and yet, there was a lot of variation in student's achievements. Bloom used Carroll's conceptual model to create his own working model of Mastery Learning. Bloom realized that, if aptitudes were predictive of the rate at which a student can learn (and not necessarily the level to which), it should be possible to fix the degree of learning expected to some mastery level and then systematically manipulate the variables in Carroll's model such that all or almost all students attained that level. Also in the 1960s, Fred S. Keller was collaborating with colleagues developing his own instructional methods of Mastery Learning. Keller's strategies were based on the ideas of reinforcement as seen in operant conditioning theories. Keller formally introduced his teaching method, Personalized System of Instruction (PSI) - sometimes referred to as Keller Plan), in his 1967 paper, \\"Engineering personalized instruction in the classroom\\". From the late 1960s to the early 1980s, there was a surge of research on both Keller's and Bloom's instruction methods. Most of these studies showed that mastery learning has a positive effect on achievement, for all subjects and at all levels. Also, mastery learning brings positive affective outcomes for both students and teachers. These studies also showed that there are many variables that are either affected by mastery learning or that influence it somehow: student entry variables, curriculum, type of test, pacing, level of mastery, and time. Despite those mostly positive research results, interest in mastery learning strategies decreased throughout the 1980s, as reflected in publication activity in professional journals and presentations at conferences. Many explanations were put forward to justify this decline, like alleged recalcitrance of the educational establishment to change, or the ineffective implementations of mastery learning methods, or the extra time demanded in setting up and maintaining a mastery learning course or even concerns that behavioristic-based models for teaching would conflict with the generally humanistic-oriented teachers and the surrounding culture. Mastery learning strategies are best represented by Bloom's Learning For Mastery (LFM) and Keller's Personalized System of Instruction (PSI). Bloom's approach was focused in the schoolroom, whereas Keller developed his system for higher education. Both have been applied in many different contexts and have been found to be very powerful methods for increasing student performance in a wide range of activities. Despite sharing some commonalities in terms of goals, they are built on different psychological principles. Learning For Mastery (LFM) =Variables of LFM= Bloom, when first proposing his mastery learning strategy in 1968, was convinced that most students can attain a high level of learning capability if the following conditions are available: * instruction is approached sensitively and systematically * students are helped when and where they have learning difficulties * students are given sufficient time to achieve mastery * there is some clear criterion of what constitutes mastery. Many variables will influence achievement levels and learning outcomes:  Aptitude  Aptitude, measured by standard aptitude tests, in this context is interpreted as \\"the amount of time required by the learner to attain mastery of a learning task\\". Several studies show that majority of students can achieve mastery in a learning task, but the time that they need to spend on is different.Glaser, R. (1968). Adapting the elementary school curriculum to individual performance. Learning Research and Development Center, University of Pittsburgh. Bloom argues that there are 1 to 5 percent of students who have special talent for learning a subject (especially music and foreign languages) and there are also around five percent of students who have special disability for learning a subject. For other 90% of students, aptitude is merely an indicator of the rate of learning.Bloom, B. S. (1968). Learning for Mastery. Instruction and Curriculum. Regional Education Laboratory for the Carolinas and Virginia, Topical Papers and Reprints, Number 1. Evaluation comment, 1(2), n2. Additionally, Bloom argues that aptitude for a learning task is not constant and can be changed by environmental conditions or learning experience at school or home.Bloom, B. S. (1964). Stability and change in human characteristics. New York, 1.Hunt, J. M. (1961). Intelligence and experience.  Quality of instruction  The quality of instruction is defined as the degree to which the presentation, explanation, and ordering of elements of the task to be learned approach the optimum for a given learner. Bloom insists that the quality of instruction has to be evaluated according to its effect on individual students rather than on random groups of students. Bloom shows that while in traditional classrooms, the relationship between students' aptitude test for mathematics and their final grade in algebra is very high, this relationship is almost zero for students who are receiving tutorial instruction in the home. He argues that a good tutor tries to find the quality of learning best fit to the given students, thus the majority of students would be able to master a subject if they have access to a good tutor.  Ability to understand instruction  According to Bloom the ability to understand instruction is defined as the nature of the task that a learner is to learn and the procedure that the learner is to follow. Verbal ability and reading comprehension are two language abilities that are highly related to student achievements. Since the ability to understand instruction varies significantly among students, Bloom recommends that teachers modify their instruction, provide help, and teaching aids to fit the needs of different students. Some of the teaching aids that could be provided according to the ability of the learner are: * Alternative Textbooks * Group Studies and Peer Tutoring * Workbooks * Programmed Instruction Units * Audiovisual Methods * Academic Games * Laboratory experiences * Simple demonstrations * Puzzles  Perseverance  Perseverance in this context is defined as the time the learner is willing to spend in learning. According to Bloom, a student who demonstrates a low level of perseverance in one learning task might have a very high level of perseverance in a different learning task. He suggests that students' perseverance be enhanced by increasing the frequency of reward and providing evidence of success in learning. He recommends that teachers use frequent feedback accompanied by specific help to improve the quality of instruction, thus reducing the perseverance required for learning.  Time allowed for learning  According to the International Study of Education in 12 countries, if the top 5% of students are omitted, the ratio of the time needed for slower and faster learners of a subject such as mathematics is 6 to 1 while there is zero or slightly negative relationship between the final grades and the amount of time spent on homework.Husén, T. (1967). INTERNATIONAL STUDY OF ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS, A COMPARISON OF TWELVE COUNTRIES, VOLUME I. Thus, the amount of time spent on homework is not a good indicator of mastery in a subject. Bloom postulates that the time required for a learner to achieve mastery in a specific subject is affected by various factors such as: * the student's aptitude for that subject, * The student's verbal ability, * the quality of instruction, and * the quality of the help provided. =LFM strategy= LFM curricula generally consists of discrete topics which all students begin together. After beginning a unit, students will be given a meaningful and formative assessment so that the teacher can conclude whether or not an objective has been mastered. At this step, instruction goes in one of two directions. If a student has mastered an objective, he or she will begin on a path of enrichment activities that correspond to and build upon the original objective. Students who do not satisfactorily complete a topic are given additional instruction until they succeed. If a student does not demonstrate that he or she has mastered the objective, then a series of correctives will be employed. These correctives can include varying activities, individualized instruction, and additional time to complete assignments. These students will receive constructive feedback on their work and will be encouraged to revise and revisit their assignment until the objective is mastered.  Preconditions  There are some preconditions for the process of mastery learning. First, the objectives and content of instruction have to be specified and clarified to both the students and the teacher. Another precondition is that the summative evaluation criteria should be developed and both the teacher and the learner should be clear about the achievement criteria. Bloom suggests that using absolute standards rather than competitive criteria, helps students to collaborate and facilitates mastery.  Operating procedures  The operating procedures are the methods used to provide detailed feedback and instructional help to facilitate the process of mastery in learning. The main operation procedures are: * Formative Evaluation, and * Alternative Learning Resources = Formative evaluation = Formative Evaluation in the context of mastery learning is a diagnostic progress tests to determine whether or not the student has mastered the subject unit.Scriven, M. (1967). The methodology of evaluation (AERA Monograph series on curriculum evaluation, No. 1). New York: Rand Mc Nally. Each unit is usually a learning outcome that could be taught in a week or two of learning activity. The formative tests are administered at the learning units. Bloom insists that the diagnostic process has to be followed by a prescription and the result of formative assessment is better to express in not-grade format since the use of grades on repeated progress evaluations prepare students for accepting a level of learning less than mastery. = Alternative learning resources = The progress tests should be followed by detailed feedback and specific suggestions so that the students could work on their difficulties. Some of the alternative learning resources are: * Small groups of students (two or three) meet and work together * Tutorial help * Reviewing the instructional material * Reading alternative textbooks * Using workbook or programmed texts * Using selected audiovisual materials  Outcomes  The outcomes of mastery learning could be summarized into two groups: 1- Cognitive Outcomes 2- Affective Outcomes = Cognitive outcomes = The cognitive outcomes of mastery learning are mainly related to increase in student excellence in a subject. According to one study, applying the strategies of mastery learning in a class resulted in the increase of students with the grade of A from 20 percent to 80 percent (about two standard deviation), and using the formative evaluation records as a base for quality control helped the teacher to improve the strategies and increase the percent of students with a grade of A to 90% in the following year.Bloom, B. S., & Carroll, J. B. (1971). Mastery learning: Theory and practice. J. H. Block (Ed.). New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. = Affective outcomes = Affective outcomes of mastery are mainly related to the sense of self-efficacy and confidence in the learners. Bloom argues that when the society (through education system) recognizes a learner's mastery, profound changes happen in his or her view of self and the outer world. The learner would start believing that he or she is able to adequately cope with problems, would have higher motivation for learning the subject in a higher level of expertise, and would have a better mental state due to less feeling of frustration. Finally, it is argued that in a modern society that lifelong learning is a necessity, mastery learning can develop a lifelong interest and motivation in learning. Personalized System of Instruction (PSI) Personalized System of Instruction, also known as the Keller Plan was developed in the mid 1960s by Fred Keller and colleagues. It was developed based on the idea of reinforcement in teaching processes. Keller gives the following description to a group of psychology students enrolled in his course developed using mastery learning theory: \\"This is a course through which you may move, from start to finish, at your own pace. You will not be held back by other students or forced to go ahead until you are ready. At best, you may meet all the course requirements in less than one semester; at worst, you may not complete the job within that time. How fast you go is up to you\\" (Keller, 1968, pg 80-81). = Five elements of PSI = There are five main elements in PSI as described in Keller's paper from 1967: # \\"The go-at-your-own-pace feature, which permits a student to move through the course at a speed commensurate with his ability and other demands upon his time. # The unit- perfection requirement for advance, which lets the student go ahead to new material only after demonstrating mastery of that which preceded. # The use of lectures and demonstrations as vehicles of motivation, rather than sources of critical information. # The related stress upon the written word in teacher- student communication. # The use of proctors, which permits repeated testing, immediate scoring, almost unavoidable tutoring, and a marked enhancement of the personal-social aspect of the educational process\\". Assessment In a mastery learning environment, the teacher directs a variety of group-based instructional techniques, with frequent and specific feedback by using diagnostic, formative tests, as well as regularly correcting mistakes students make along their learning path. Assessment in the mastery learning classroom is not used as a measure of accountability but rather as a source of evidence to guide future instruction. A teacher using the mastery approach will use the evidence generated from his or her assessment to modify activities to best serve each student. Teachers evaluate students with criterion-referenced tests rather than norm-referenced tests. In this sense, students are not competing against each other, but rather competing against themselves in order to achieve a personal best. Criticism =Time-achievement equality dilemma= The goal of mastery learning is to have all students reach a prescribed level of mastery (i.e. 80–90% on a test). In order to achieve this, some students will require more time than others, either in practice or instruction, to achieve success. The Time-Achievement Equality Dilemma refers to this relationship between time and achievement in the context of individual differences. If you hold achievement constant, time will need to vary. If time is held constant (as with modern learning models), achievement will vary. According to its critics, mastery theory doesn't accurately address this relationship. Bloom's original theory assumes that with practice, the slower learners will become faster learners and the gap of individual differences will disappear. Bloom believes these differences in learning pace occur because of lack of prerequisite knowledge and if all children have the same prerequisite knowledge, then learning will progress at the same rate. Bloom places the blame on teaching settings where students aren't given enough time to reach mastery levels in prerequisite knowledge before moving on to the new lesson. He also uses this to explain why variance in student learning is smaller in the first grade when compared to students in the 7th grade (the smart get smarter, and the slower fall further behind). He referred to this learning rate variance as the Vanishing Point. Studies have found support for both sides of Bloom's argument. A four-year longitudinal study by Arlin (1984) found no indication of a vanishing point in students who learned arithmetic through a mastery approach. Students who required extra assistance to learn material in the first year of the study required relatively the same amount of additional instruction in the 4th year. Individual differences in learning rates appear to be impacted by more than just method of instruction, contrary to Bloom's opinions. =Methodology errors in research= Experimental vs. control groups In studies investigating the effectiveness of mastery learning, control and experimental groups were not always valid. Experimental groups typically consisted of courses that were developed to adhere to the best principles of mastery. However, control groups were sometimes existing classes to use as a comparison. This poses a problem since there was no way to test the effectiveness of the control group to begin with - it could have been a poorly constructed course being compared against a strictly designed mastery course. Measurement tools In studies where the largest effect sizes were found, experimenter made tests were used to test the mastery levels of students in the experiments. By using tests designed for the experiment, the mastery instruction intervention may have been able to better tailor the learning goals of the class to align with the measurement tool. Conversely, these dramatic effect sizes essentially disappeared when standardized tests were used to measure mastery levels in control and experimental groups Study duration There are very few studies that investigate the long- term effects of mastery learning. Many studies included an arbitrary 3-4 week intervention period and results were based on findings from this time period. It's important to consider the length of time students were immersed in a mastery learning program to get a greater understanding of the long-term effects of this teaching strategy. =General concerns and opinions= Typical mastery programs involve providing class instruction then testing using reliable tools (i.e. multiple choice unit test). This format of learning may only be beneficial to learners who are interested in surface rather than deep processing of information. This contradicts many of today's modern learning approaches which focus less on direct assessment of knowledge, and more on creating meaningful applications and interpretations of the obtained knowledge (see Constructivism (philosophy of education)) The Chicago Mastery Learning Reading program was criticized for a focus on testing. A concern is that children were taught to pass tests without a focus on enduring skills. The duration of the retention of skills was questioned. A love of reading was not promoted. Students rarely read books or stories. Student failure was an aspect of the program design. 80% was required on 80% of the test to pass. This resulted in huge retention levels. Ultimately, the program was not practical to implement. The value of having all children achieve mastery brings into question our general view of success. If the goal of education became having children become experts, grades would become much less varied. That is, you would theoretically have a high school graduating class all with grades above 90%. Universities would have to make selections from a pool of applicants with similar grades, how would admission requirements have to change to account for uniform ratings of intelligence? Would time it took to reach mastery become a new measure of success? These questions about the wider implications of mastery as a new standard raise discussion about its actual value. Mastery learning today Mastery Learning has been one of the most highly investigated teaching methods over the past 50 years. While it has been the subject of high criticism, it has also been found to have resounding success when implemented correctly. A meta-analysis by Guskey & Pigott (1988) looked at 46 studies that implemented group-based mastery learning classrooms. Results found consistently positive effects for a number of variables including \\"student achievement, retention of learned material, involvement in learning activities, and student affect\\". However, a notable variation was found within student achievement and it was believed this was due mainly to the subject being taught. Courses such as science, probability, and social studies yielded the most consistent positive results, while other subjects were varied. Another large-scale meta analysis conducted by Kulik et al. (1990) investigated 108 studies of mastery programs being implemented at the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary level. Results revealed positive effects in favour of these teaching strategies, with students also reporting positive attitudes toward this style of learning. This study also found mastery programs to be most effective for weaker students. Despite the empirical evidence, many mastery programs in schools have been replaced by more traditional forms of instruction due to the level of commitment required by the teacher and the difficulty in managing the classroom when each student is following an individual course of learning. However, the central tenets of mastery learning are still found in today's teaching strategies such as differentiated instruction and understanding by design. Researchers at Northwestern University pioneered the use of mastery learning in the health professions. In 2006 they investigated mastery learning vs. traditional medical education in advanced cardiac life support techniques and showed that internal medicine resident trainees significantly improved adherence to American Heart Association protocols after mastery training. Subsequent investigations showed improved patient care practices as a result of this rigorous education including reduced patient complications and healthcare costs. The approach designed by Northwestern investigators is currently in use at other institutions and medical schools throughout the US and the world. In 2012 Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams published the book Flip Your Classroom, Reach Every Student in Every Class Every Day.Bergmann, Jonathan, and Aaron Sams. Flip Your Classroom: Reach Every Student in Every Class Every Day. International Society for Technology in Education, 2012. The second half of the book was dedicated to how to implement what they called the Flipped- Mastery Model. They merged mastery learning with flipped learning and saw significant results. The book has spurred many teachers across the world to adopt the Flipped-Mastery approach. Bergmann and Sams show that the logistical problems associated with setting up a mastery learning program are now solved by technology. If teachers have to deliver direct instruction, this can be time-shifted with either an instructional video or a flipped-reading assignment. The issue of multiple assessments is also solved by programs that allow for testing to be much more seamless and less burdensome.

Notation RT. refers to the total resistance of the circuit to the right of resistor RX. In electronics, a current divider is a simple linear circuit that produces an output current (IX) that is a fraction of its input current (IT). Current division refers to the splitting of current between the branches of the divider. The currents in the various branches of such a circuit will always divide in such a way as to minimize the total energy expended. The formula describing a current divider is similar in form to that for the voltage divider. However, the ratio describing current division places the impedance of the considered branches in the denominator, unlike voltage division where the considered impedance is in the numerator. This is because in current dividers, total energy expended is minimized, resulting in currents that go through paths of least impedance, hence the inverse relationship with impedance. Comparatively, voltage divider is used to satisfy Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL). The voltage around a loop must sum up to zero, so the voltage drops must be divided evenly in a direct relationship with the impedance. To be specific, if two or more impedances are in parallel, the current that enters the combination will be split between them in inverse proportion to their impedances (according to Ohm's law). It also follows that if the impedances have the same value the current is split equally. Current divider  A general formula for the current IX in a resistor RX that is in parallel with a combination of other resistors of total resistance RT is (see Figure 1): :I_X = \\\\frac{R_T}{R_{X} + R_T}I_T \\\\ where IT is the total current entering the combined network of RX in parallel with RT. Notice that when RT is composed of a parallel combination of resistors, say R1, R2, ... etc., then the reciprocal of each resistor must be added to find the total resistance RT: :\\\\frac{1}{R_T}=\\\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\\\frac{1}{R_2}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{R_n} General case Although the resistive divider is most common, the current divider may be made of frequency dependent impedances. In the general case: :\\\\frac{1}{Z_T}=\\\\frac{1}{Z_1}+\\\\frac{1}{Z_2}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{Z_n} and the current IX is given by: :I_X = \\\\frac{Z_T} {Z_X}I_T \\\\ , where ZT refers to the equivalent impedance of the entire circuit. Using Admittance Instead of using impedances, the current divider rule can be applied just like the voltage divider rule if admittance (the inverse of impedance) is used. :I_X = \\\\frac{Y_X} {Y_{Total}}I_T Take care to note that YTotal is a straightforward addition, not the sum of the inverses inverted (as you would do for a standard parallel resistive network). For Figure 1, the current IX would be :I_X = \\\\frac{Y_X} {Y_{Total}}I_T = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{R_X}} {\\\\frac{1}{R_X} + \\\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\\\frac{1}{R_2} + \\\\frac{1}{R_3}}I_T =Example: RC combination= Figure 2: A low pass RC current divider Figure 2 shows a simple current divider made up of a capacitor and a resistor. Using the formula below, the current in the resistor is given by: :: I_R = \\\\frac {\\\\frac{1}{j \\\\omega C}} {R + \\\\frac{1}{j \\\\omega C} }I_T ::: = \\\\frac {1} {1+j \\\\omega CR} I_T \\\\ , where ZC = 1/(jωC) is the impedance of the capacitor and j is the imaginary unit. The product τ = CR is known as the time constant of the circuit, and the frequency for which ωCR = 1 is called the corner frequency of the circuit. Because the capacitor has zero impedance at high frequencies and infinite impedance at low frequencies, the current in the resistor remains at its DC value IT for frequencies up to the corner frequency, whereupon it drops toward zero for higher frequencies as the capacitor effectively short-circuits the resistor. In other words, the current divider is a low pass filter for current in the resistor. Loading effect Figure 3: A current amplifier (gray box) driven by a Norton source (iS, RS) and with a resistor load RL. Current divider in blue box at input (RS,Rin) reduces the current gain, as does the current divider in green box at the output (Rout,RL) The gain of an amplifier generally depends on its source and load terminations. Current amplifiers and transconductance amplifiers are characterized by a short- circuit output condition, and current amplifiers and transresistance amplifiers are characterized using ideal infinite impedance current sources. When an amplifier is terminated by a finite, non-zero termination, and/or driven by a non-ideal source, the effective gain is reduced due to the loading effect at the output and/or the input, which can be understood in terms of current division. Figure 3 shows a current amplifier example. The amplifier (gray box) has input resistance Rin and output resistance Rout and an ideal current gain Ai. With an ideal current driver (infinite Norton resistance) all the source current iS becomes input current to the amplifier. However, for a Norton driver a current divider is formed at the input that reduces the input current to ::i_{i} = \\\\frac {R_S} {R_S+R_{in}} i_S \\\\ , which clearly is less than iS. Likewise, for a short circuit at the output, the amplifier delivers an output current io = Ai ii to the short circuit. However, when the load is a non-zero resistor RL, the current delivered to the load is reduced by current division to the value: ::i_L = \\\\frac {R_{out}} {R_{out}+R_{L}} A_i i_{i} \\\\ . Combining these results, the ideal current gain Ai realized with an ideal driver and a short-circuit load is reduced to the loaded gain Aloaded: ::A_{loaded} =\\\\frac {i_L} {i_S} = \\\\frac {R_S} {R_S+R_{in}} \\\\frac {R_{out}} {R_{out}+R_{L}} A_i \\\\ . The resistor ratios in the above expression are called the loading factors. For more discussion of loading in other amplifier types, see loading effect. =Unilateral versus bilateral amplifiers= Figure 4: Current amplifier as a bilateral two-port network; feedback through dependent voltage source of gain β V/V Figure 3 and the associated discussion refers to a unilateral amplifier. In a more general case where the amplifier is represented by a two port, the input resistance of the amplifier depends on its load, and the output resistance on the source impedance. The loading factors in these cases must employ the true amplifier impedances including these bilateral effects. For example, taking the unilateral current amplifier of Figure 3, the corresponding bilateral two-port network is shown in Figure 4 based upon h-parameters.The h-parameter two port is the only two-port among the four standard choices that has a current-controlled current source on the output side. Carrying out the analysis for this circuit, the current gain with feedback Afb is found to be :: A_{fb} = \\\\frac {i_L}{i_S} = \\\\frac {A_{loaded}} {1+ {\\\\beta}(R_L/R_S) A_{loaded}} \\\\ . That is, the ideal current gain Ai is reduced not only by the loading factors, but due to the bilateral nature of the two-port by an additional factorOften called the improvement factor or the desensitivity factor. ( 1 + β (RL / RS ) Aloaded ), which is typical of negative feedback amplifier circuits. The factor β (RL / RS ) is the current feedback provided by the voltage feedback source of voltage gain β V/V. For instance, for an ideal current source with RS = ∞ Ω, the voltage feedback has no influence, and for RL = 0 Ω, there is zero load voltage, again disabling the feedback.

The figures project only slightly from the background rather than standing freely. Depending on the degree of projection, reliefs may also be classified as high or medium relief. Relief carving can be described as \\"carving pictures in wood\\". The process of relief carving involves removing wood from a flat wood panel in such a way that an object appears to rise out of the wood. Relief carving begins with a design idea, usually put to paper in the form of a master pattern which is then transferred to the wood surface. Most relief carving is done with hand tools - chisels and gouges - which often require a mallet to drive them through the wood. As wood is removed from the panel around the objects traced onto it from the pattern, the objects themselves stand up from the background wood. Modeling of the objects can take place as soon as enough background has been removed and the object edges are trimmed to the pattern lines. In order to secure the wood panel, a workbench with fixtures like bench-dogs, carver's screw or clamps, is necessary. Carving tools come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, some aimed strictly at the hobbyist, but others directed at professional carvers. Some carving tools are held with one hand while the carving is held in the other. But most relief carving requires that the wood panel be secured so that both hands may be on the carving tool. Much of the skill required for relief carving lies in learning to grip and manipulate tools to get the desired effect. Tool sharpening is also a necessary skill to learn, and dull tools are a severe obstacle to effective carving.  Stages of relief carving  # Create a pattern, drawn on paper. # Prepare a wood panel for carving. This may be a single piece of wood or a laminated panel. # Transfer the pattern to the panel, using carbon paper as the transfer medium. # Remove wood around the objects that comprise the pattern. # Model the objects # Detail the objects # Tidy the background behind the objects # Apply a suitable finish to the panel =Styles of relief carving= *1. High relief, usually between 1/2\\" and 2\\" in depth. *2. Bas relief, or Low relief usually under 1/2\\" in depth. *3. Deep relief, usually over 2\\" in depth. *4. Pierced relief, where holes are carved clear through the wood. Some carvers prefer to finish their carving with a clear finish. But others incorporate color and pyrography into their relief carvings.

The lighthouse is located on a mostly submerged reef. The name Sombrero Key goes back to the Spanish, and old charts show a small island at the spot, but by the later 19th Century the island had eroded away, with some parts of the reef exposed at low tide. As a result, the reef and the lighthouse have also been called Dry Banks. The lighthouse was put in service in 1858, automated in 1960, and was deactivated in 2015. The foundation is iron pilings with disks, and the tower is a skeletal octagonal pyramid of cast iron. It is a tall red painted tower. It has two platforms. The lower one, above the water, held water and fuel tanks, the generator (after the light was electrified), boat hoists and a workshop. The upper platform, above the water, held the quarters for the staff. The original lens, a first-order Fresnel lens, is now on display in the Key West Lighthouse Museum. The Sombrero Key Light is the tallest lighthouse in the Florida Keys, and was the last lighthouse constructed under the supervision of Lieutenant George Meade of the Bureau of Topographical Engineers.

Channon moved to England in 1920 and became strongly anti-American, feeling that American cultural and economic views threatened traditional European and British civilisation. He wrote extensively about these views. Channon quickly became enamoured of London society and became a social and political climber. Channon was first elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) in 1935. In his political career he failed to achieve ministerial office and was unsuccessful in his pursuit of a peerage, but he is remembered as one of the most famous political and social diarists of the 20th century. His diaries have so far been published only in an expurgated edition; however, they are due to be republished in full by Hutchinson, with the first volume scheduled to appear in September 2020. Biography =Early years= Channon was born in Chicago to an Anglo-American family. In adult life he took to giving 1899 as his year of birth, and was embarrassed when a British newspaper revealed that the true year was 1897.Davenport-Hines, Richard, \\"Channon, Sir Henry (1897–1958)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, accessed 29 August 2009 His grandfather had immigrated to the US in the mid-nineteenth century and established a profitable fleet of vessels on the Great Lakes, which formed the basis of the family's wealth.The Times obituary, 9 October 1958, p. 16 Channon's paternal grandmother was descended from eighteenth-century English settlers. Channon's parents were Vesta (née Westover) and Henry Channon II, known as Harry. After graduating from Francis W. Parker School and taking classes at the University of Chicago, Channon travelled to France with the American Red Cross in October 1917 and became an honorary attaché at the American embassy in Paris the next year. In 1920 and 1921, Channon was at Christ Church, Oxford where he received a pass degree in French,The Manchester Guardian, 5 July 1921, p. 12 and acquired the nickname \\"Chips\\". He began a lifelong friendship with Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, whom in his diaries he called \\"the person I have loved most\\".Channon, p. 20, quoted by Davenport-Hines The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) said of this phase of Channon's life, \\"adoring London society, privilege, rank, and wealth, he became an energetic, implacable, but endearing social climber.\\" He also became an author. =Author= Channon rejected his American background and was passionate about Europe in general and England in particular. The US, he said, was \\"a menace to the peace and future of the world. If it triumphs, the old civilisations, which love beauty and peace and the arts and rank and privilege, will pass from the picture.\\"McSmith, A, \\"Original Westminster hellraiser: The secret world of Chips Channon\\", The Independent, 13 April 2007 His anti-Americanism was reflected in his novel, Joan Kennedy (1929), described by the publishers as \\"the story of an English girl's marriage to a wealthy American and of her attempts to bridge the gulf created by differences of race and education.\\"Advertisement, The Times, 22 March 1929, p. 10 Channon's anti- Americanism did not prevent his living off American money. A grant of $90,000 from his father, and an $85,000 inheritance from his grandfather made him financially comfortable with no need to work. He wrote two more books: a second novel, Paradise City (1931) about the disastrous effects of American capitalism, and a non-fiction work, The Ludwigs of Bavaria (1933). The latter, a study of the last generations of the ruling Wittelsbach dynasty of Bavarian kings, received excellent notices, and was in print twenty years later. Some critical reservations reflected Channon's adulation of minor European royalty: The Manchester Guardian said of his account of the 1918 revolution, \\"he seems to have depended almost exclusively on aristocratic sources, which are most clearly insufficient.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 29 June 1933, p. 5 Despite this, the book was described on its reissue in 1952 as \\"a fascinating study ... excellently written\\".The Observer, 21 December 1952, p. 7 Reviews of both the 1933 edition and the reissue singled out a section on architecture and décor, Channon's expertise in which took a practical form shortly after the publication of the book when he had first a large town house and then a country house in which to engage his passion for design. =Marriage and politics= In 1933, Channon married the brewing heiress Lady Honor Guinness (1909–1976), eldest daughter of Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh.The Times, 2 July 1933, p. 9 In 1935 their only child was born, a son, whom they named Paul. On 31 January 1936, the Channons moved into a grand London house at 5 Belgrave Square, near the London house of the Duke of Kent,Carreño, p. 83 and two years later also acquired a country estate at Kelvedon Hatch, near Brentwood in Essex. Channon quickly established himself as a society host, in his famous blue and silver dining room designed by Stéphane Boudin and modelled on the Amalienburg in Munich. Perhaps the apogee of his career in that role came on Thursday, 19 November 1936, with a guest list headed by Edward VIII, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, then Regent and his wife Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark, the Duke of Kent and his wife Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark and Mrs Simpson, of whom Channon was a friend and admirer. Twenty- two days later, on 11 December, Edward abdicated. Channon, who was a naturalised British citizen (as of 11 July 1933),Carreño, p. 69 joined the Conservative Party. At the 1935 general election, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Southend, the seat previously held by his mother-in-law Gwendolen Guinness, Countess of Iveagh. After boundary changes in 1950, he was returned for the new Southend West constituency, holding the seat until his death in 1958. In 1936, the rising Conservative minister Rab Butler, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office appointed Channon his Parliamentary Private Secretary. Butler was associated with the appeasement wing of the Conservative party, and Channon, as with the abdication, found himself on the losing side. In the words of the ODNB: \\"Always ferociously anti-communist, he was an early dupe of the Nazis because his attractive German princelings hoped that Hitler might be preparing for a Hohenzollern restoration.\\" Just as after George VI's accession Channon's standing in royal circles went from high to low, so, as an appeaser, did his standing in the Conservative party after the failure of appeasement and the appointment of the anti-appeaser Winston Churchill as prime minister. Channon remained loyal to the supplanted Neville Chamberlain, toasting him after his fall as \\"the King over the Water\\", and sharing Butler's denigration of Churchill as \\"a half-breed American\\".Colville, pp 141–41 Channon's interest in politics waned after this, and he took an increasing interest in the Guinness family brewing interests, though remaining a conscientious and popular constituency MP. In July 1939, Channon met the landscape designer Peter Daniel Coats (1910–1990), with whom he began an affair that led to Channon's separation from his wife the following year and the dissolution of the marriage in 1945. Despite Channon's conduct, it was he who sued for divorce. His wife, who had left him in favour of a Czech airman, did not contest the suit and he was, therefore, theoretically the innocent party.The Times, 21 February 1945, p. 2 Among others with whom he is known to have had affairs was the playwright Terence Rattigan, and Channon was on intimate terms with Prince Paul of Yugoslavia and the Duke of Kent, though whether those relationships were platonic or otherwise is not known. Once it became clear that he would not achieve ministerial office, Channon sought elevation to the peerage, but in this, too, he was unsuccessful. The highest honour he achieved was a knighthood in 1957, the year before his death. Legacy =Diaries= Channon's diaries have not been published in full. Under Channon's will, he left his diaries and other material to the British Museum \\"on condition that the said diaries shall not be read ... until 60 years from my death.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 11 December 1958, p. 8 An expurgated selection from the diaries, edited by Robert Rhodes James was published in 1967. The necessity for expurgation is illustrated by the reaction of an Oxford contemporary who, when told that no diaries from that period existed, said, \\"Thank God!\\"Diaries p. 6. Rhodes James said he saw well-connected people go white when they heard that Channon had kept a journal. An entry in Channon's diary for 1941, describing his introduction to a young member of the Greek royal family at an Athens cocktail party, is the earliest known reference to the future marriage of Prince Philip of Greece and then 15-year-old heiress presumptive to the British throne, Princess Elizabeth: \\"He is extraordinarily handsome, and I recalled my afternoon's conversation with Princess Nicholas [an aunt of Philip's]. He is to be our Prince Consort, and that is why he is serving in our Navy.\\" In his comments accompanying the published selection, Rhodes James stated that \\"Peter Coats edited the original MS of the Diaries.\\"Diaries p. 253n. He also stated that Coats arranged the preparation of a complete typescript of the Diaries as Channon's handwriting was often difficult to read.Diaries p. 22. It is not clear whether Coats carried out an initial expurgation before the editorial discretion exercised by Rhodes James. Four previously unknown volumes turned up at a car boot sale in 1991.The Daily Telegraph obituary of Paul Channon, 30 January 2007 It was reported after Paul Channon's death that his heir, the diarist's grandson, was considering authorising the publication of the uncensored texts. Robert Rhodes James quotes in his introduction to the diaries a self-portrait written by Channon on 19 July 1935: :Sometimes I think I have an unusual character – able but trivial; I have flair, intuition, great good taste but only second rate ambition: I am far too susceptible to flattery; I hate and am uninterested in all the things most men like such as sports, business, statistics, debates, speeches, war, and the weather; but I am riveted by lust, furniture, glamour and society and jewels. I am an excellent organiser and have a will of iron; I can only be appealed to through my vanity. Occasionally I must have solitude: my soul craves for it. All thought is done in solitude; only then am I partly happy.Diaries p. 11. Reviewing the published diaries in The Observer in November 1967, Malcolm Muggeridge wrote, \\"Grovellingly sycophantic and snobbish as only a well-heeled American nesting among the English upper classes can be, with a commonness that positively hurts at times. And yet – how sharp an eye! What neat malice! How, in their own fashion, well written and truthful and honest they are! … What a relief to turn to him after Sir Winston's windy rhetoric, and all those leaden narratives by field-marshals, air-marshals and admirals!\\"\\"Diary of a super-snob\\", The Observer, 19 November 1967, p. 27 The diaries, even in their bowdlerised form, provoked a writ for libel from one of Channon's fellow MPs, though the case did not come to court, being settled privately in the decade after Channon's death.The Guardian, 1 March 1969, p. 3 Historian Alan Clark, a Conservative MP from February 1974, refers on multiple occasions to Channon's diaries in his own diaries. An unexpurgated three-volume edition, edited by journalist and historian Simon Heffer, is due to begin publication with the first volume scheduled to be issued in September 2020. While the 1967 edition began in 1934, the complete version begins in 1918. The subsequent volumes are due in 2021 and 2022. =Reputation= Richard Davenport-Hines, the author of Channon's entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) comments that Elliot Templeton in W. Somerset Maugham's novel The Razor's Edge (1944) and the disappointed schoolmaster Crocker-Harris in Terence Rattigan's play The Browning Version (1948) were partly inspired by Channon.The ODNB entry prints the name of the Rattigan character as \\"Croker-Harris\\" Among his contemporaries his reputation ranged from high to low. Nancy Mitford said of the diary, \\"you can't think how vile & spiteful & silly it is. One always thought Chips was rather a dear, but he was black inside how sinister!\\" Duff Cooper thought Channon a \\"toady\\" but Cooper's widow, Lady Diana Cooper wrote immediately after Channon's death, \\"never was there a surer or more enlivening friend ... . He installed the mighty in his gilded chairs and exalted the humble ... without stint he gave of his riches and his compassion.\\"The Times, 23 October 1958, p. 17 War historian Max Hastings referred to Channon as a \\"consummate ass\\".Hastings, Max., Winston's War, Churchill 1940–1945. 2010, Knopf, New York, p. 14 Notes References Colville, John.

Notable artwork for DC Comics include a long run on Batman as regular penciller, Nightwing, Richard Dragon, and most recently Green Arrow. Biography =Early life and career= McDaniel was born in 1965 in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was an avid fan of superheroes, and his mother would buy him stacks of comics from flea markets. He learned to draw from all those old comics. McDaniel graduated from the Penn Hills Senior High School in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania. After graduation Scott wanted to be a surgeon, and attended Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where his father's heart surgeon studied. He was enrolled as a Pre-Med student until the day he walked into Inorganic Chemistry and saw a 4-foot-long Schrödinger Wave equation scrawled on the chalk board. At that moment he knew Pre-Med was not for him. Next he became a chemistry major, and then a chemical engineering major. In freshman year at Bucknell he met Glenn Herdling, a friendship that would last for quite some time. After graduating from Bucknell, Glenn took his double major (English and Psychology) and went on to work with Marvel Comics. Scott took his BS in electrical engineering and went to work with the Kearfott Division of the Singer Company. Cover to Nightwing #100 (2004). Art by Scott McDaniel. He married his high school girlfriend and had a son Alex. He worked as an electrical engineer during the day, and worked on his art in the evenings. His friend Glenn would take his art into Marvel to get critiques by other editors and artists. After several years of that critiquing, McDaniel began to get small penciling jobs from Marvel. McDaniel relocated to Pittsburgh (in the suburb Monroeville), and continued working as an electrical engineer with the Loftus Division of the Eichleay Corporation. About a year later, McDaniel was getting more assignments from Marvel. When the call came with an opportunity to work on Daredevil, he quit his engineering job and began his career as a comic book artist. =Art style= McDaniel's work tends to feature bold, bright colors against stark black, with a greater than average attention to fight scenes.

It is best known for its finely decorated and, to modern tastes, somewhat gaudy rococo style of porcelain; indeed its name has almost come to classify such a style and as such pieces by other factories are regularly and incorrectly attributed to Rockingham. A famous piece is the (50 kg) ornate item known as the Rhinoceros Vase (of which two are known) made to demonstrate the skill of producing such a large and complex item as a single piece of fired porcelain.BBC A History of the World: Rhinoceros Vase, Rockingham, Swinton. Retrieved 27 March 2017 The factory was located in Swinton, near Rotherham, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, and for the later part of its lifetime existed under the patronage of the Earls Fitzwilliam, indirect descendants of the Marquesses of Rockingham, who were the major landowners in the area, and whose stately home and extensive park was located several miles away in Wentworth. What is often called \\"Rockingham-glazed\\" pottery or \\"Rockingham ware\\" was widely produced in Britain and the United States in the 19th century, earthenware with a thick brown ceramic glaze, in a style associated with the earlier 18th-century production. History of the pottery Former kiln of the pottery Records show that a potworks making utilitarian earthenware for the local market existed on the site in 1745. In 1778 it passed to new owners, who enlarged the works and began to produce better classes of wares. It was linked between 1787 and 1806 with the Leeds Pottery, until full ownership passed into the hands of the local Brameld family in 1807.Hughes, 291-292 After this time the Pottery was barely profitable and continued through considerable assistance from the Earl. Experiments with the manufacture of porcelain began in 1820. By 1826 the pottery was bankrupt. However the Bramelds' experiments with porcelain had just come to fruition and the Earl was impressed by the potential of the new products. He bailed out the pottery and allowed his family's crest and name to be used by the pottery. Production of fine porcelain services and ornamental wares commenced rapidly, which through the connections of the Earl brought the factory to the attention of the aristocracy. Orders from royalty lead to use of the sub-title \\"Manufacturer to the King\\" from 1831. The pinnacle of the factory's output was the two intricately decorated \\"Rhinoceros\\" vases which were advertised by the works as being the largest single-piece porcelain objects in existence (one of which is in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the other of which is in the Clifton Park Museum in Rotherham) and a large exquisite dessert service commissioned for King William IV, which took eight years to complete, was eventually delivered to his successor Queen Victoria and can be seen at Windsor Castle. Unfortunately the Brameld family were more ceramic artists than businessmen: even though they were bailed out by the Earl they were regularly short of capital and struggled to make a profit. At this time it was relatively common for large but cash-strapped companies to pay their employees in IOU notes which would circulate in local economy as a form of cash: the Bramelds frequently resorted to issuing these. The Earl felt it was his duty as the local landowner to bail out the pottery to prevent the economic hardship that the collapse of the pottery would cause on his estate. Eventually in the face of mounting debts, and with a new less interested Earl in residence at Wentworth, no further financial support was extended and the bankrupt pottery closed in 1842. One of the original kilns, a small part of the factory, a gatehouse (both now private residences) and the pottery flint mill pond remain in a small park today as remnants of this once-great factory. Rockingham pottery and porcelain Red-mark period tea cup and saucer Puce- mark period cup and saucer Rockingham porcelain was produced in two distinct periods: 1826–1830, the so-called red-mark period, and 1831–1842, the puce- mark period. As their names suggest, these periods are defined by the backstamps found on porcelain. Porcelain products included tea and coffee services, dinner and dessert services, writing sets and ink pots, scent jars and pots, baskets, bed posts, porcelain plaques, figurines, animals, cabinet plates and cups. Patterns varied from regular geometric designs featuring brightly coloured reserves and simple gilding, through intricate neo-rococo designs of scrolls and acanthus leaves, to ornate encrusted decorative wares. Many of the more decorative pieces feature landscapes, floral and botanical specimens. Royal and aristocratic commissions often feature the family's arms. There is some evidence to show that the most decorative pieces were produced towards the end of the red-mark period and the early puce-mark periods: earlier pieces often feature the more geometric shapes, while later pieces, though retaining the neo-rococo shapes of the early puce-mark period, feature less extravagant decoration that was possibly more fitting of the first years of the Victorian age. Amongst its other products, the factory was also famous for producing a deep brown, almost iridescent brown-glazed earthenware. In these wares, it was most famous for producing an ingenious style of pot that is filled from a hole in the bottom via a vacuum lock, known as a Cadogan. Examples of these in many sizes are often found, sometimes featuring gilding. The Brown Betty is an example of this kind of earthenware. Amongst its more standard products were blue and green transfer-printed creamware and pearlware services and other items featuring a variety of scenes: the \\"Returning Woodman\\" or \\"Peasant\\" (often on octagonal plates) is possibly the most recognisable of these. Identifying original Rockingham =Earthenware= Rockingham-produced earthenware is often transfer printed, but occasionally enamelled pieces may be found. Brown-glazed 'Cadogan' pots are also common. Many pieces are backstamped with an embossed \\"Brameld\\" mark. Other pieces can be identified by matching with known backstamped designs. Brown-glazed earthenware marked with an embossed \\"Rockingham\\" mark is often not genuine Rockingham but the output of other contemporary factories seeking to impersonate popular Rockingham wares. =Porcelain= On Rockingham porcelain the most common marks are a red griffin with the words \\"Rockingham Works Brameld\\" and a puce griffin with the words \\"Rockingham Works Brameld Manufacturer to the King\\". Other variations are occasionally found. Pattern numbers are present on services; numbers outside the range 400–1800 are not known on original Rockingham, although there was a subsidiary 2/1 to 2/100 series that is genuine. Due to the frequency with which other manufacturers' wares are mistakenly attributed to this factory, and since pieces were frequently backstamped (in particular the saucers of tea services), the shapes of unmarked pieces must be matched with known Rockingham shapes to associate unmarked wares with this pottery with any confidence. Other Rockingham =Baguley= After the closure of the works in 1842, some of the craftsmen remained on site to continue manufacturing on their own. The most successful of these was the Baguley family, the most senior of whom Isaac Baguley had been a painter of porcelain who rose to be the manager of the painting and gilding department at the factory. Baguley decorated porcelain that was bought in as unglazed biscuitware from other potteries. The classic brown Rockingham glaze was used, the rights to which Baguley had acquired after the closure of the pottery, with much use of gilding and occasional enamelling. Isaac Baguley died in 1855 and his son Alfred continued the business, moving from the Rockingham works to nearby Mexborough in 1865, where he continued decorating bought-in porcelain until his death in 1891. Immediately after the closure of the works, Baguley used an identical backstamp to the Rockingham puce mark. This changed into a similar mark titled \\"Rockingham Works Baguley\\". However, later the mark changed to an unrelated device with \\"Rockingham Works Mexborough\\" (or \\"Mexboro\\") as the subtitle, except on works produced for the Fitzwilliam household which retained the griffin mark. Use of these marks together with the brown glaze and gilding on non-Rockingham shapes makes Baguley pieces easy to identify. They are interesting and valuable in their own right. =Bennington and other American ware= American stoneware spaniel figurine, \\"Rockingham Pottery\\", Bennington, Vermont, 1850-1900 The famous brown earthenware glaze discovered by the Rockingham pottery was imitated by many potteries and made its way across the Atlantic to be used on many decorative and utilitarian pieces from a variety of U.S. potteries, the most famous of which was at Bennington, Vermont. The name \\"Rockingham\\" is often used in the U.S. to describe the rather substantial brown-glazed earthenware output of these factories: Americans may be more familiar with its use in this context. Jabez Vodrey and his family are notable for having made Rockingham- style ware in East Liverpool, Ohio in the mid-19th century, while Edwin Bennett was also producing it in Baltimore. Many examples of this type of Rockingham pottery may be found in the East Liverpool Museum of Ceramics. File:Match holder, John E. Jeffords & Co.

Although some were never intended to be passed off as genuine Rockingham (for example Paragon's \\"Rockingham\\" range of mid-20th century), other pieces are backstamped with a Griffin mark similar to the genuine product to the extent that the unwary could mistake them for originals. Give-aways are \\"Rockingham, England\\" and \\"Rockingham, Staffordshire\\" marks which are late 20th century and not genuine Rockingham.

Plot Tex (Woody Allen) is a butcher who kills his unfaithful wife Candy (Sharon Stone). After cutting up the body, Tex buries most of her body parts in the desert in New Mexico. A blind woman accidentally trips over Candy's hand, which has not been buried. Picking it up, her sight is restored, and she proclaims the hand to be the \\"Hand of the Virgin Mary.\\" The hand then becomes the talk of the village and people flock there to heal themselves. This ranges from a crippled man growing new legs, a teenager being relieved of his acne and a midget having his manhood enlarged. Tex hears of these miracles, and attempts to retrieve the hand while being pursued by patrol officer Bobo (Kiefer Sutherland) who was one of his wife's lovers. Eventually, Tex and the officer track down the hand, with Tex's theft of the hand undoing all the miracles that it has performed. While Tex is in prison, he is visited by his wife's spirit, who reveals that, despite her life of whoring and adultery, the suffering she endured with Tex allowed her to get into Heaven, and she arranges for him to get out of his cell so that he can return the hand to the church.

Botanists have long known that plants grown in a greenhouse tend to be taller and more spindly than plants grown outside. M.J. Jaffe discovered in the 1970s that regular rubbing or bending of stems inhibits their elongation and stimulates their radial expansion, resulting in shorter, stockier plants. Growth responses are caused by changes in gene expression. This is likely related to the calcium-binding protein calmodulin, suggesting Ca2+ involvement in mediating growth responses.

The province was governed by a chief commissioner appointed by the Governor-General of India. History In 1935 Panth Piploda was separated from Bombay. Panth-Piploda was a small tract of territory comprising only 10½ villages, which were held by five different thakurs. In 1765, the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire assigned the revenues from the villages to the family of Sambhaji Attaji, a Deshastha Brahmin. This ruling family was later known as the family of the Khandekar Pandits. The arrangement made by the Peshwa was respected by the British when they took over Panth Piploda from the Marathas in 1817. The ruling family did not have any proprietary rights whatever in these villages and were mere tankadars (recipients of the cash allowance). This cash allowance was paid to them by the Political Agent in Malwa Agency who realized it from the thakurs in whose territories the villages lay. The estate was managed by a Superintendent under the control of the Political Agent with headquarters at Kharua (also spelled as Kharwa). In 1936, there were two guaranteed tankadars, who received payments totaling Rs. 46,000. It became a province of British India in 1942.

Second, many non-profit organizations did not have funding for needed professional engineering services to design displays and exhibits or keep relevant databases. The solution was to use the skills of undergraduate students through the curriculum to provide services to local non-profit organizations. The program originally started as an educational program, and finds its roots in the concept of \\"service learning\\".USATODAY.com - Program combines service, engineering to build a better entrepreneur In liberal arts colleges, EPICS courses manage to encourage enrollment from students from outside the engineering program.Keller ’63 donates $25 million - The Daily Princetonian History EPICS was founded in the Fall of 1995 at Purdue University starting with five project teams. At Purdue, the program has grown to 25 project teams which include over 400 students. In 2000, the program was expanded and implemented at other universities. Today EPICS is operating at 15 universities across the United States, including Princeton University,You are being transferred University of Notre Dame, Dartmouth College,Dartmouth EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service) Penn State University, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Ohio State University, Arizona State University, and University of California, Merced.UC Merced's EPICS portal The University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand is the only university that runs the EPICS programme internationally. = EPICS Learning Community at Purdue = At Purdue, EPICS is offered as a learning community to freshman students in the First Year Engineering program. The learning community program requires that students live in a specific university residence with other students in the EPICS program. Students are assigned roommates of the same gender and in the past Harrison Hall has been the location of the EPICS learning community. The EPICS students occupy most of a floor of Harrison (for men) but are split to separate towers by gender. In addition, students in the EPICS learning community will take some courses together, usually freshmen English (English 106) and the first part of the freshmen engineering course (previously ENGR195). Freshmen in EPICS are assigned to specific EPICS teams (not by roommate). These teams work with a community partner to meet a particular need. Some examples of teams include the Columbian Park Zoo team which designs enrichment devices for animals at the local zoo and the Habitat for Humanity team which helps to plan sustainable housing. EPICS functions as a class usually with a set number of lecture sessions to attend each semester and weekly lab time with teams. Documentation and design reviews are important parts of EPICS. Students learn to keep design notebooks and record project information. Near the midpoint and end of the semester, students present their work in a design review to professional engineers. These are very important events in EPICS and serve as a key time for students to receive feedback on their work. Students who enter EPICS as freshmen engineers are required to be part of the course portion only for the first semester, although they can opt to continue in future semesters. EPICS at Arizona State University EPICS came to ASU in 2008. It is described as a way to help students engage in real-world engineering problems while they are still in school. The success of the program at the university level led to the creation of EPICS High, a similar program adapted for high schools and middle schools. In 2017, five students finished their charity project started through the EPICS program in 2013, a mobile dental clinic that will serve thousands of people in Nicaragua, Arizona and California. It was said to be one of the most ambitious projects to come out of the program. The students took on the project to assist IMAHelps, a California non-profit. Catalina Laboratory Products, a Tucson-based startup, donated thousands of dollars to help furnish and stock the clinic.

The Barton–Kellogg reaction is also known as Barton–Kellogg olefination and Barton olefin synthesis. The Barton-Kellogg reaction This reaction was pioneered by Hermann Staudinger, and also goes by the name Staudinger type diazo-thioketone coupling.  Reaction mechanism  In the reaction mechanism for this reaction, the diazo compound reacts as a 1,3-dipole in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with the thioketone to give a 5-membered thiadiazoline ring. This intermediate is unstable; it extrudes a molecule of nitrogen to form a thiocarbonyl ylide, which then cyclizes to form a stable episulfide. Triphenylphosphine reacts as a nucleophile, opening the three-membered ring to form a sulfaphosphatane. In a manner similar to the Wittig reaction, this structure then expels triphenylphosphine sulfide to produce an alkene. Barton- Kellogg reaction mechanism  Scope  The diazo compound can be obtained from a ketone by reaction with hydrazine to a hydrazone followed by oxidation. Many reagents exist for this conversion for example silver(I) oxide and (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene. The thioketone required for this reaction can be obtained from a ketone and phosphorus pentasulfide. Desulfurization of the episulfide can be accomplished by many phosphines and also by copper powder. Barton-Kellogg reaction molecular motor synthesis The main advantage of this reaction over the McMurry reaction is the notion that the reaction can take place with two different ketones. In this regard the diazo-thioketone coupling is a cross-coupling rather than a homocoupling.

Background and education Bowie was born at Grassland, an historic estate near Annapolis Junction, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, to Thomas John Bowie and Susanna Anderson. He was educated in public schools, at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut (B.S. 1893; M.A. 1907; Sc.D. 1919), and Lehigh (C.E. 1895; Sc.D. 1922). He received honorary degrees (LL.D. 1936) from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, at the meeting of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) of which he was President from 1933 to 1936, and from George Washington University (Sc.D. 1937). Career In 1895 Bowie entered the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. During World War I he served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers as a major. He represented the United States at various international geodetic conferences and congresses. His scientific researches had to do with the theory of isostasy and its applications to dynamic and structural geology. He retired from government service at the age of 64 in 1936. Bowie's professional activity was directed toward three general objectives: *\\"Promotion of mapping of the United States and its territories and improvement of cartographic methods and technique. *Expansion of geodetic work and improvement of instruments and methods. *Promotion of interest and progress in geophysical sciences, through the media of national and international bodies.\\" He was the first President of the American Geophysical Union from 1920 to 1922 and served as President a second time from 1929 to 1932. In 1932, Bowie received the Prix Charles Lagrange from the Académie royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique. He later received the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1937. Personal An Episcopalian, Bowie married Elizabeth Taylor Wattles of Alexandria, Virginia on June 28, 1899. Together, they had two children, William (Jr.) and Clagett. William died after a three-week illness and lies buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

He played college football as an end at Yale University. While at Yale he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and Skull and Bones, and was the first winner of the Heisman Trophy in 1936 and the second winner of the trophy awarded by the New York Athletic Club, the year it was renamed in honor of John Heisman. His jersey number was 19. Kelley was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1969. Kelley was an All-American and the captain of the Yale football team. Following his career at Yale, he signed a one-game contract with the Boston Shamrocks of the American Football League in 1937 but never played. Following his career in football, Kelley was a history teacher and alumni director at the Peddie School in Hightstown, New Jersey, his alma mater. He taught algebra at Cheshire Academy and spent 12 years in the glove manufacturing industry. The Ian Graham Athletic Center at the Peddie School holds a replica of the Heisman Trophy donated to the school by Kelley. To benefit his nieces and nephews, Kelley sold his Heisman Trophy at an auction in December 1999 for $328,110 to the owner of The Stadium Museum, Restaurant & Bar in Garrison, New York, where it now resides.The selling price was a record for a Heisman, easily surpassing the $230,000 that O.J. Simpson's Heisman earned at auction. His health was visibly failing by then after having suffered a minor stroke and having open- heart surgery, and on June 27, 2000, Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Hightstown, ruled a suicide by the police. He was 85 when he died, and is believed to be the first Heisman winner to take his own life. He was survived by his fourth wife and 18 nieces and nephews.

Ghazala has built experimental instruments and/or consulted for many prominent musicians and media companies including Tom Waits, Peter Gabriel, King Crimson, the Rolling Stones, Faust, Blur, Chris Cutler (the Residents, Henry Cow, Art Bears), Sri Chinmoy, Rob Schwimmer (Simon and Garfunkel), Nine Inch Nails, Towa Tei, Blue Man Group, Yann Tomita and MTV, among others. Ghazala's work has been covered globally in the press including the New York Times's declaration of circuit-bending as part of the fine arts movement (April 8, 2004, Technology Section, Matthew Mirapaul), and can be found being taught world-wide. Ghazala's work is held in various galleries internationally including the permanent collections of New York City's Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim and the Whitney Museum of American Art as part of the Fusion Arts compendium. Ghazala's influence upon creative electronic design is global, having originated the planet's first \\"grassroots electronic art movement\\" (while Ghazala has noted that he was not the lone, or first, experimenter in the field, it should be recognized that his contemporaries’ work, regardless of date, did not spawn an international and specific art movement replete with original terminology, processes and an ever-increasing fellowship). Ghazala's practice with chance art (the root of circuit-bending) also involves studies in dye migration materials and Japanese suminagashi , as well as liquid, gel and smoke chambers, mobiles and pyrotechnics. History Ghazala accidentally discovered the technique of circuit bending in the 1960s when he left a toy amplifier in his desk and heard it start to emit sounds comparable to those produced by expensive synthesizers of the day. The amplifier's casing had been opened, exposing its inner circuitry and allowing it to short circuit when placed against the metal desk. It is this chance aspect of bending that serves as the foundation of circuit-bending. Since discovering circuit bending, Ghazala has built countless instruments. These mostly consist of electronic toys modified with the circuit bending technique and customized until they barely resemble the original product. He has produced numerous audio compositions with these instruments which have been featured on many albums. He has also written a series of works relating to and teaching the circuit bending process, including his book, published by Wiley & Sons, titled Circuit-Bending: Build Your Own Alien Instruments. Ghazala coined the term \\"immediate canvas\\" in his work with circuit bending, which is the concept that through circuit bending the hurdles of electronic design are avoided. Anyone can step up to an open circuit and create, without needing to know electronic theory or daunting equations. Another term coined by Ghazala is BEAsape which means BioElectronicAudiosapien. When body contacts are used, the body of the performer is used as a capacitor - there is a fusion between man and machine into one purpose which Ghazala says is something new zoologically and musically.

It occurred in June 1817, when a band of Western Cherokee and their allies under Chief Spring Frog (Too-an-tuh) attacked Pasuga, an Osage village at the foot of Claremore Mound (in present- day Rogers County, Oklahoma). The village was nearly empty; only women, children, and the very sick and elderly remained there. Most of the village was currently away on a seasonal hunt that often lasted up to three or four months. The Cherokee killed or captured every remaining member of Chief Clermont's band and destroyed everything they could not carry away. Historians consider it one of the bloodiest Native American massacres in modern history.\\"Battle of Claremore Mound\\" Native News Today, 13 February 2013; Accessed 13 March 2016. Conflict between Osage and Cherokee On November 10, 1808, at Fort Clark, Missouri, the Osage Nation made a treaty with the United States, ceding all of its land east of a line that ran south from Fort Clark to the Arkansas River and all of its land west of the Missouri River. The land reserved to the Osage Nation was further reduced by treaties signed at St. Louis (June 2, 1825, Fort Gibson (January 11, 1839) and Canville, Kansas (September 29, 1865). According to Eaton, the Osage established two main villages about 1800, when they migrated to the area between the Verdigris and Grand rivers. These were called Pasona (near present-day Claremore, Oklahoma) and Pasuga (at the foot of Claremore Mound). About 1760, a portion of the Cherokee people, who had been living in the Southeastern United States, had begun moving to land claimed by other tribes west of the Mississippi River. This produced a long period of conflict between the Western Cherokee (as the migrants had become known) and the Osage, a more warlike tribe who had dominated the Plains area in today's Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, as well as Arkansas. The Osage often took captives (mostly women and children), and killing others, trying to drive out the invaders. Cherokees retaliated in kind, but were ineffective at stopping the raids. By 1817, an estimated three thousand Western Cherokees had settled in the area known as Arkansas.May, Jon D. \\"Claremore Mound, Battle of,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed March 13, 2016 The Cherokee-led attack In January 1817 the Arkansas Cherokee began planning a retaliatory attack against the Osage and began asking their relatives from the east to aid them in a battle against the Osage. They also asked for help from the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Delaware, and others, including whites. The Cherokee knew that Osage men left their villages lightly guarded during the Strawberry Moon to go on a long-distance hunt for bison. Smith, Pat. \\"Why is June called the Strawberry Moon?\\" USA Today, 3 June 2015; Accessed 14 March 2015. Therefore, this would be the most opportune time to attack. The Cherokee were enraged by the treatment they had endured at the hands of the Osage, which helped offset the greater numbers of the Osage had. The Cherokee had another advantage as they had acquired more modern weapons - rifles - and were well-experienced in their use. Which finally gave them a match able force against the Osage tribe who had acquired guns in the 1600s from their trading with the French and all Warriors were well acquainted with. Some 500 Cherokee, along with a number of Choctaw, Chickasaw and whites, convened at a place on the Arkansas River. (The modern city of Russellville, Arkansas developed here.) They traveled upriver into Indian Territory and went overland to the Osage villages. After luring a representative of the Southern Osage away from the village, the invading party attacked, killing thirty-eight Osage and taking one hundred and four captives. According to Eaton, Chief Clermont was present at the time of the attack and was killed during the fighting. He was later buried on Claremore Mound. Another source indicates that Pasuga was attacked first, and that the inhabitants of Pasona had been alerted by the sounds and smells of smoke when the marauders burned the village. The Pasugans hid in a cave previously discovered and prepared as a hideout by Black Dog, who had gone on the buffalo hunt. Thus, they survived the raid on their village and could care for the few survivors from Pasuga.Burns, Louis F. A History of the Osage People. p. 67. (2004) University of Alabama Press. Tuscaloosa, Alabama. . Accessed July 24, 2016. The aftermath Most of the Osage warriors had been away on a hunt when their village was attacked. In an attempt to maintain peace with the U.S. government they did not retaliate immediately. Some time later (1820) the Cherokee followed the Osage further up the river. The Osage knew they were coming and were ready and had gathered numbers and allies. The Osage decimated Cherokee. Instead of cowing the Osage, the defeat at Claremore mound stirred them to greater fury. The bitter frontier war continued in unabated with Osage’s raiding and killing indiscriminately”Oklahoma:A history of five centuries] as they retreated down the river their Osage sons (Mad Buffalo) and grandsons were waiting in ambush. At every Cherokee retreat an Osage ambush party of Claremore descent was waiting to slaughter the fleeing Cherokees. For twenty years the descendants of Claremore attacked the Cherokees. The Osage who were taken captive were given to the Eastern Cherokee as payment for their contributions in the battle. In December of the same year construction began on Fort Smith between the Cherokee and Osage settlements. The following summer the U.S. forced the Osage to cede more land to the Cherokee who were settling in the area, apparently because of their victories after the Battle of Claremore Mound (Oklahoma a history of five centuries). In December 1818 the U.S. government began construction of a fort on the Arkansas River, close to the western border of Arkansas Territory. When completed, Fort Smith was staffed with troops whose primary mission was to prevent further hostilities between the Osage and the Western Cherokee. In 1824, this function was transferred to Fort Gibson, which was built near the confluence of the Grand and Verdigris rivers in Indian Territory. Fort Smith was abandoned until a replacement was constructed several years later. The Osage continued to live in the area until they moved to the Osage Reservation in 1839.

Helena Maria Viramontes (born February 26, 1954) is an American fiction writer and professor of English. Childhood and education Viramontes was born in East Los Angeles on February 26, 1954 to Serafin Viramontes, and Maria Louise La Brada Viramontes. She was one of eight siblings in a working class family. Viramontes graduated from Garfield High School, one of the high schools that participated in the 1968 Chicano Blowouts, a series of protests against unequal conditions in East Los Angeles public schools. The Chicano Movement played a significant role in her development as a writer and the writing style she developed reflected her understanding and upbringing in the streets of East Los Angeles. She then worked part-time while attending Immaculate Heart College, from which she earned her Bachelor of Arts in English literature in 1975. While a grad student in the English department at Cal State L.A., Viramontes was told by a professor that she did not belong there because she was writing about Latino issues. Also, while attending a graduate program in creative writing at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in the early 1980s, “a professor told me not to write about Chicanos, but to write about people.” That criticism drove her out of the program. In 1977, her short story \\"Requiem for the Poor\\" was awarded a prize from Statement Magazine. In 1979, she won a literary prize from the Spanish department at UC Irvine for her short story \\"Birthday.\\" She returned to the fine arts program at UCI in 1990 and graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts in 1994. Viramontes' Childhood Neighborhood Was Divided by the East LA Interchange in the Early 1960s Professional career Viramontes is currently the Goldwin Smith Professor of English at Cornell University. Her career began in the Chicano magazine ChismeArte as a literary editor. Her short stories have been published in a variety of literary journals. The major themes of her stories are informed by her childhood experiences in East Los Angeles, and the impact of César Chávez and the United Farm Workers on the life of her family. Viramontes writing often tell stories of forgotten minority communities.https://research.cornell.edu/news-features/erased- history-forgotten-communities Many of her works feature strong female characters, and child protagonists figure prominently into her work. Other works have been deemed \\"democratic novels\\", in that no single protagonist dominates the storyline. Throughout all of her work, a love of life and of all of humanity pervades, despite poverty and the other challenges her characters face. In 1985, Arte Público Press published The Moths, collection of short stories. Helena Maria Viramontes took a break from her work, got married and had two children. During her hiatus from academia she published in many underground literary journals such as ChismeArte. In 1988, she co-edited Chicana Creativity and Criticism with María Herrera-Sobek, a volume dedicated to the literary output of Mexican-American women. She also returned to UC Irvine to complete her MFA, which was awarded in 1994. As part of the program, she received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to attend a writing workshop with the Colombian Nobel Laureate Gabriel García Márquez. In 1995, her first novel Under the Feet of Jesus was published to critical acclaim. In 2007, she published Their Dogs Came With Them, a novel that took her 17 years to complete. It was noted for its strikingly personal and realistic prose, and discusses harsh realities and social conditions fo the poor. The novel was largely inspired by her childhood in the midst of East Los Angeles, with the gang conflicts and social strife at the center of her novel. She has said that her house is next to four cemeteries, and that when the freeways were built in East Los Angeles in the 1960s (see East LA Freeway) myth has it that the cement was poured over the resting places of some forgotten souls, their bones disturbed. = Awards and honors = * National Endowment for the Arts National Endowment for the Arts, 1/1989 * Fellowship, Sundance Institute, 7/1989 * Under the Feet of Jesus, New Voices Quality Paperback Book, 1995 * Under the Feet of Jesus, finalist, Discover Great New Writers, 1996 * John Dos Passos Prize for Literature, 1996 * The Moths exhibited in Autrey Museum of Western Heritage, 5/1998-9/1998 * Alumna of the year, Immaculate Heart College, 10/2000 * Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa, St. Mary's College of Notre Dame, 5/2000 * Featured with John Steinbeck and Carlos Bulosan on Oregon Public Broadcasting,\\"American Passages—A Literary Survey\\" #12, \\"The Migrant Struggle\\"https://www.learner.org/series/american- passages-a-literary-survey/migrant-struggle/ * Luis Leal Award, Santa Barbara Festival of Books, 2006 https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2006/012157/writer- viramontes-receive-luis-leal-literature-award * Outstanding Latino/a Cultural Award in Literary Arts or Publications, 2007 * United State Artists Fellowship, 2007 First novel: Under the Feet of Jesus Under the Feet of Jesus (Penguin, 1995) follows the lives of thirteen-year-old Estrella, her brothers and sisters, her mother Petra, Petra's lover Perfecto, and the cousins Alejo and Gumecindo, all Latino migrant workers living and working in the California grape fields. Since the novel's dedication refers to Cesar Chavez, who led migrant laborers to ask for better wages and conditions, Chavez' actions in such movements as the Delano Grape Strike must be considered as background to the novel's fictions. The story reflects the hardships of the migrants’ lives set against the beauty of the landscape.

Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2000. 142-54. Chapter 1 begins with the family driving to the fields to harvest the fruit. The chapter draws the personalities of the main characters on emotional, spiritual, and physical levels; we learn of the hardships that they experience as migrant workers. Petra, the mother, abandoned by her husband and raising five children alone, has endured bouts of insanity and self- mutilation. She meets Perfecto, who fixes things with his toolbox so well that, after he finishes, customers exclaim, Perfecto! A hare-lipped child cuts himself and is entertained by shadow-puppetry until he forgets his injuries. Gumecindo and Alejo pick peaches, not to eat, but to sell. In a darkened, derelict barn, a mysterious chain dangles from the ceiling, and the sounds of birds fill the darkness. The novel proceeds in a series of striking images stemming from Viramontes' work at the time, on a film. Working back and forth between Estrella's and Alejo's puppy-love and Perfecto's memories, Chapter 2 develops several conflicts. Perfecto, now age 73, recalls falling in love with his first wife, Mercedes[3], and the loss of an infant, his first child. He hides his hope to leave Petra's family and return forever to the scenes of his early love with Mercedes. He asks Estrella to help him tear down the derelict barn for a payment that will fund his trip. Meanwhile, Estrella meets Alejo at a dance, where they begin to fall in love. Alejo and Estrella discuss the La Brea Tar Pits, which are, according to the critic Burford, a trope for forces which devour.Burford, Arianne. \\"Cartographies of a Violent Landscape: Viramontes' and Moraga's Remapping of Feminisms in Under the Feet of Jesus and Heroes and Saints. Genders 47 (2008). Web. http://www.genders.org/g47/g47_burford.html . Reproduced in Contemporary Literary Criticism-Select. In Chapter 3, Alejo is sick with the daño of the fields (pesticide poisoning). He is sicker, according to Perfecto, than any yerba (herb) or prayer can heal. The family decides to take Alejo to a clinic but is halted when their station wagon is stuck in deep mud. Everyone helps except Alejo, who can barely pick his chin up. In Chapter 4, Estrella and her family finally arrive at a remote, worn-down clinic. The only staff member, a nurse, seems distant from Alejo and unwilling to give him any but the most clinical of attentions. She suggests that the family take the boy to a hospital; however, she does not recognize how very little money the family has to pay the clinic's fee, to buy gasoline, or to pay a doctor's bill. Estrella repeatedly recommends Perfecto to the nurse as a repairman, so that the migrants can barter his work for medical services rather than pay money for them; the nurse repeatedly cannot read the vast gulf between even her small earning power and her patients’. At last, Estrella threatens the nurse with a crow bar, takes back the meager fee she had paid the clinic, and uses the money to buy gasoline to take Alejo to a hospital, where the family leaves him to the doctors’ care and to his fate. In Chapter 5, the family arrives at their shack without Alejo. The dirty dishes are where they left them. The younger children fall asleep. Although Petra has not yet told Perfecto that she is pregnant with his child, he is aware of the developing infant and recoils from the responsibility. Leaning against the decrepit car, he mourns for the places he left in memory and the money he does not have to return. Petra is awake and restless and resolves to pray. Estrella rushes off, lantern in hand, to the only place she feels temporarily free, the old barn. As the novel ends, she is standing on the roof, silhouetted against a starry sky. The novel's meaning develops partly through plot and partly through imagery evoked through the novel's lush language. The plot lets readers know how delicate is the balance between having enough to eat and not, between sanity and insanity, between health and incapacitating illness. Exasperatingly, the loveliness of natural scenery and of acts of human decency almost mock the workers’ frailty and hardship. The mountains and stars, frequently described, endure beyond human carelessness, ignorance, and cruelty. Peaches evoke the deliciousness of food and eating, and food's unavailability to many. Rotting fruit evoke preciousness, such as human talent, that is daily wasted. Blood, aching backs, feet, hands, eyes, all mentioned frequently, remind readers how much human life is housed in a body which must stay safe and healthy in order to live. Viramontes notes that she had \\"to think about the stories of the mujeres out there, their sheer arrogance to survive, their incredible strength to take care of others.\\" The juxtaposition of Petra, carrying her child, and her daughter's figure silhouetted against the sky at the novel's close emphasizes Viramontes' chicana feminism. Viramontes often uses her works as witness to history, or as a voice for those who do not have a public platform upon which to speak (see, e.g., her short story \\"The Cariboo Cafe,\\" (in The Moths and Other Stories 65-82) her novel, Their Dogs Came with Them and the article \\"Xicanismo\\"). In interviews she evinces a longtime commitment to civil rights. Her commitment to rights is not abstract, since Viramontes' own parents harvested grapes during her youth. The novel likewise reflects Viramontes' feminism in her creation of strong female characters. Of these, Carballo and Giles report, \\"Women in this novel rescue themselves.\\" Their Dogs Came with Them Readers typically want a happy ending in any novel. Their Dogs Came with Them Viramontes demonstrates why a happy ending may not be possible. Cuevas, in her study of Viramontes' work, suggests that happy endings do not always occur for Latinas, and queer Latinas. People in these communities do not overcome disparities and systems of oppression, and violence. Similarly, Pattison suggests that people in urban communities are deprived of their political connections to the space and erasure of memory sites. Communities are sacrificed in the name of urban expansion. Viramontes’ novel showcases the 1960s freeway construction in East Los Angeles in which Mexican American sites of cultural memory were permanently erased. The author emphasizes the traumatic relationship between the characters and their disappearing community. In the novel Viramontes focuses on the Chicano movement that the young characters joined during a time in which the freeway threatened the erasure of their community and culture. She also creates a space to imagine Latina futures from a broken ground, unredeemed past or non-redemptive history. She maps the lives of four Latinas who navigate personal and political unrest with their communities while emphasizing how Chicanas and queer-Latinas have been an integral part of Chicana/o history. Her character's identities are intertwined with their communities through the imagery and metaphors of their bodies. She is able to articulate positive and negative dynamics within their neighborhood during the turbulent time of the freeway construction.

Simon, and starring Bette Midler and Woody Allen. The title is a play on Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, and the film itself features similar themes of marital disintegration. The film received mostly negative reviews, with critics focusing on the characters' arbitrary and unrealistic emotional reactions, the lack of successful humor, and the overdone production. Plot Nick (Woody Allen), a sports lawyer, is married to psychotherapist and author Deborah (Bette Midler). After years of being happily married, Nick reveals to Deborah that he has had an affair. She is soon shocked and requests a divorce, but later admits that she herself has been unfaithful.

Mall scenes with elevators and escalators were filmed at the Stamford Town Center in Stamford, Connecticut. Mall exteriors were filmed at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles, California, the mall where most of the picture is set. Reception The film received mostly negative reviews, and rated at 32% on Rotten Tomatoes from an aggregate of 25 reviews. At the time of its release, film critics almost unanimously commented that the characters' emotional responses were contrived and false, and that the gaudy set design and production seemed an obvious effort to hide the film's lack of both comedic value and dramatic substance. Roger Ebert summarized the story as \\"a fog of arbitrary storytelling and desperate gimmicks, sudden revelations and unmotivated mood swings, in a movie that seems to have been written without having been thought about very much.\\" The Los Angeles Times Peter Rainder opined that \\"the pairing of Allen and Midler, which might seem like the kind of weirdo match-up that could produce a comedy classic, never takes flight. ... Allen and Midler are such highly individual actors that they never quite seem to be in the same orbit; the series of juicy marital revelations that keep perking the movie come across as forced and schematic because we never really believe in the relationship.\\" Variety similarly said that the characters' \\"emotional storms never achieve any veracity. They seem like just another indulgence on the part of the pampered, secure spouses.\\" Many critics found the film's awfulness to be especially startling in light of its esteemed director and lead actors. Time Out, for example, said it \\"comes over as a piss-take of Mazursky by Mazursky.\\" However, most commented that Allen and Midler's performances were not to blame, as there was simply no way to play the characters that would have made them likable or believable. Vincent Canby of The New York Times, one of the few to give the film a positive recommendation, instead argued that Allen and Midler saved the thin and unstructured script: \\"Little by little, though, the stars take over their characters. They play together with a straight-on honesty that is funny because of the oddball situations, and moving for the unexpected, easy legitimacy of the performances.\\" Scenes from a Mall was amongst Siskel & Ebert's worst movies of 1991. Gene Siskel, who chose the film for the list with Ebert approving the choice, remarked, \\"Bette Midler and Woody Allen in the same film as a married couple? Well, the very idea of that is funnier than anything in the movie!\\" Box office The film was not a box office success but did manage to bring back its budget.

Born in his father's residence, Shire Cottage in Inagheramore, Larne, County Antrim, Ireland, the son of Robert Nelson, Esq. and Frances Quinn, he emigrated to California in 1854. He arrived in British Columbia in 1858, but unlike the horde of others who arrived in that year he had not come in pursuit of gold but to participate in the building of the colony as an English dominion. Eschewing the goldfields themselves, he founded the B.C. & Victoria Express Company, which had the dominant share of the freight and travel market between Victoria and New Westminster and Yale, with partner George Dietz, and also the lumbering firm Moody, Dietz and Nelson, the third partner of which was Sewell Moody, which was the operating name of Moodyville Sawmill Co. in what is now North Vancouver. The freighting firm was sold off early on to Frank Barnard Sr., whose B.C. Express Company then became the leading firm for shipments and travel to and from the Cariboo region Although active in politics, he did not stand for office to the Legislative Council until 1870 (for the colonial riding of New Westminster), by which time he had become one of the principal promoters of British Columbia's merger with the Confederation of Canada. He was a member of the Yale Convention, which ushered in BC's union with Canada, and was on the committee of that body charged with seeing the agreement come into effect. He was a member of the colonial Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, and in 1871 was one of the first Members of Parliament from British Columbia to the House of Commons, representing New Westminster District. A Liberal-Conservative, he was re-elected in 1872. He did not run in 1874. In 1879, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of Barkerville, British Columbia. He withdrew from business in 1882, and in February, 1887 married Emily Stanton, daughter of J.B. Stanton, Esq., of the Canadian civil service. He and resigned his senate seat in 1887, when he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia. In 1892, he resigned as Lieutenant-Governor and returned to England where he died the following March of Bright's disease. Family Mrs Emily Nelson by William James Topley Hon Hugh Nelson, then a Senator married September 17, 1885 Emily Stanton, daughter of Isaac Brock Stanton and his wife, Maria Wilson.

It is the sulfur analogue of an epoxide or aziridine. They are also known as thiiranes, olefin sulfides, thioalkylene oxides, and thiacyclopropanes. Episulfides are less common and generally less stable than epoxides. The most common derivative is ethylene sulfide (C2H4S). Structure According to electron diffraction, the C-C and C-S distances in ethylene sulfide are respectively 1.473 and 1.811 Å. The C-C-S and C-S-C angles are respectively 66.0 and 48.0°.

Episulfides have an innate ring strain due to the nature of three-membered rings. Therefore, most reactions of episulfides involve ring-opening. Most commonly, nucleophiles are employed for the ring-opening process. For terminal episulfide, nucleophiles attack the primary carbon. Nucleophiles include anionic hydride, thiolates, alkoxide, amines, and carbanions. :450px Applications Thiiranes occur very rarely in nature and are of no significance medicinally.

The initiative was developed by the National Cancer Institute (part of the National Institutes of Health) and was maintained by the Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). In 2011 a report on caBIG raised significant questions about effectiveness and oversight, and its budget and scope were significantly trimmed. In May 2012, the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) was created as caBIG's successor program. History The National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the United States funded the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) initiative in spring 2004, headed by Kenneth Buetow. Its goal was to connect US biomedical cancer researchers using technology known as grid computing. The program, led by the Center for Bioinformatics and Information Technology (CBIIT), began with a 3-year pilot phase. The pilot phase concluded in March 2007, and a trial was announced. Buetow promoted the program in 2008. In addition to caGrid, the underlying infrastructure for data sharing among organizations, caBIG developed software tools, data sharing policies, and common standards and vocabularies to facilitate data sharing. Software tools targeted: *Collection, analysis, and management of basic research data *Clinical trials management, from patient enrollment to adverse event reporting and analysis *Collection, annotation, sharing, and storage of medical imaging data *Biospecimen management caBIG sought to provide foundational technology for an approach to biomedicine it called a “learning healthcare system.” This relies on the rapid exchange of information among all sectors of research and care, so that researchers and clinicians are able to collaboratively review and accurately incorporate the latest findings into their work. The ultimate goal was to speed the biomedical research process. It was also promoted for what is often called Personalized Medicine. caBIG technology was used in adaptive clinical trials such as the Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and molecular AnaLysis 2 (I-SPY2), which was designed to use biomarkers to determine the appropriate therapy for women with advanced breast cancer. Health information technology Health information technology (HIT) was promoted for management and secure exchange of medical information among researchers, health care providers, and consumers. HIT initiatives mentioning caBIG were: NCI and the American Society of Clinical Oncology initiated a collaboration to create an oncology-specific electronic health record system using caBIG standards for interoperability and that will enable oncologists to manage patient information in an electronic format that accurately captures the specific interventional issues unique to oncology. The Nationwide Health Information Network was an initiative to share patient clinical data across geographically disparate sources and create electronically linked national health information exchange. It might be somehow related. Collaborations A BIG Health Consortium was formed in 2008 to promote personalized medicine, but disbanded in 2012. In July 2009, caBIG announced a collaboration with the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation to build an online cohort of women willing to participate in clinical trials. Called the Army of Women, it had a goal of one million in its database; by December 2009 the site was \\"launched\\", and about 30,000 women and men signed up by 2010. The Cancer Genome Atlas aimed to characterize more than 10,000 tumors across at least 20 cancers by 2015. caBIG provided connectivity, data standards, and tools to collect, organize, share, and analyze the diverse research data in its database. Since 2007, NCI worked with UK National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI). The two organizations shared technologies for collaborative research and the secure exchange of research data using caGrid and the NCRI Oncology Information Exchange (ONIX) web portal announced in August 2009. ONIX shut down in March 2012. The Duke Cancer Institute used caBIG clinical trials tools in their collaboration with the Beijing Cancer Hospital of Peking University. Implementation The project intended to connect 65 NCI-designated cancer centers to enable collaborative research. Participating institutions could either “adopt” caBIG tools to share data directly through caGrid, or “adapt” commercial or in-house developed software to be caBIG-compatible. The caBIG program developed software development kits (SDKs) for interoperable software tools, and instructions on the process of adapting existing tools or developing applications to be caBIG-compatible. The Enterprise Support Network program included domain-specific expertise, and support service providers, third party organizations that provide assistance on a contract-for-services basis. A web portal using the Liferay software was available from 2008 to 2013. =Open source = Since 2004, the caBIG program used open-source communities, adapted from other public-private partnerships. The caBIG program produced software under contract to software development teams largely within the commercial research community. In general, software developed under US government contracts is the property of the US government and the US taxpayers. Depending on the terms in specific contracts, they might be accessible only by request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The timeliness of response to such requests might preclude a requester from ever gaining any secondary value from software released under a FOIA request. The caBIG program placed the all caBIG software in a software repository freely accessible for download. Open source means anyone can modify the downloaded software; however, the licensing applied to the downloaded software allows greater flexibility than is typical. An individual or enterprise is allowed to contribute the modified code back to the caBIG program but is not required to do so. Likewise, the modifications can be made available as open source but are not required to be made available as open source. The caBIG licensing even allows the use of the caBIG applications and components, combined with additions and modifications, to be released as commercial products. These aspects of the caBIG program actually encourage commercialization of caBIG technology. =Results= In 2008, GlaxoSmithKline announced it would share cancer cell genomic data with caBIG. Some private companies claimed benefits from caBIG technology in 2010. A caGrid community web site was created in 2007. The 1.x version of the core software was added to a GitHub project in mid-2013, under the BSD 3-Clause license. It used version 4.03 of the Globus Toolkit, and the Taverna workbench system to manage workflow and the Business Process Execution Language. Software called Introduce was developed around 2006. Contributors included the Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science, and private companies Ekagra Software Technologies and Semantic Bits. =Criticism= By 2008, some questioned if the program was benefiting large pharmaceutical companies. By 2011, the project had spent an estimated $350 million. Although the goal was considered laudable, much of the software was unevenly adopted after being developed at great expense to compete with commercial offerings. In March 2011, an NCI working group assessment concluded that caBIG \\"...expanded far beyond those goals to implement an overly complex and ambitious software enterprise of NCI-branded tools, especially in the Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) space. These have produced limited traction in the cancer community, compete against established commercial vendors, and create financially untenable long-term maintenance and support commitments for the NCI\\". In 2012, the NCI announced a new program the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) as a successor to caBIG. caGrid The caGrid computer network and software supported the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) initiative of the National Cancer Institute of the US National Institutes of Health. caBIG is a voluntary virtual informatics infrastructure that connects data, research tools, scientists, and organizations. In 2013, the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) re- released caGrid under the BSD 3-Clause license, and migrated the source repository to github. caGrid uses version 4.03 of the Globus Toolkit, produced by the Globus Alliance. = Portal= The caGrid Portal was a Web-based application built on Liferay that enables users to discover and interact with the services that are available on the caGrid infrastructure. Portal serves as the primary visualization tool for the caGrid middleware. It also served as a caBIG information source. Through the caGrid Portal, users had access to information about caBIG participants, caGrid points of contact (POCs), and caGrid-related news and events. =Workflow= caGrid workflow uses: * Active BPEL * Taverna =Contributors= * Ohio State University * University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory * SemanticBits, LLC * Ekagra Software Technologies =Criticism= In March 2011, the NCI published an extensive review of CaBIG, the NCI CBIIT program that funded the caGrid software development (see , ), which included a long list of problems with the program, and recommended that most of the software development projects should be discontinued.

It emerged in the 16th century, but the use of shino' glaze is now widespread, both in Japan and abroad. It is identified by thick white glazes, red scorch marks, and a texture of small holes. Some experts believe it should not treated as distinct from Oribe ware but described as \\"white Oribe\\", with the pottery usually called just Oribe described as \\"green Oribe\\" instead.  History  The origin of the term \\"Shino\\" is uncertain. It may be derived from “shiro”, the Japanese word for “white”. Or it may refer to the tea master Shino Soshin (1444–1523). Kuroda and MurayamaKuroda, Ryoji. Murayama, Takeshi. ‘’Classic Stoneware of Japan: Shino and Oribe’’, Kodansha International, 2002. . refer to a text by Kanamori Tokusiu (1857) which states; > \\"Shino Soshin had a favorite white-glazed, 'shoe-shaped' bowl, imported from > South Asia, which he used as a teabowl.\\" The first Shino ware was developed during the Momoyama period (1568–1600), in kilns in the Mino and Seto areas. The glaze, composed primarily of ground local feldspar and a small amount of local clay, produced a satiny white color. It was the first white glaze used in Japanese ceramics. Wares decorated with Shino were fired in the Anagama kilns used at that time. Anagama kilns were single-chambered kilns made from a trench in a hillside that was covered with an earthen roof. As the anagama kilns were replaced by the multi- chambered noborigama kilns during the first decade of the 17th century, Shino was supplanted by the Oribe ware glazes used in the newer kilns. Shino enjoyed a brief revival in the 19th century, but then faded into obscurity. In the 1930s and 1940s, two Japanese potters, Toyozo Arakawa and Hajime Katō, developed the first modern Shino glaze by studying Momoyama Shino pots. Working independently, in 1974, Virginia Wirt, a student of Warren MacKenzie at the University of Minnesota, developed a glaze formula that also sought to imitate the historical exemplars. Her glaze, which added soda ash and spodumene to the base of feldspar and clays, was the first American Shino. Shino has since become one of the more popular glazes in American pottery studios. Many variations have spawned from Wirt’s original formula. Although many different colorants and fluxes can be added, creating a wide range of effects, Shino glazes in America are all characterized by the use of soda ash and by a high ratio of alumina to silica. Under certain firing conditions, the soda ash causes carbon to be trapped in the glaze, creating the characteristic grey spots or patches on the glaze surface.  Characteristics  Like other Mino wares, the Shino style is based on older Seto ware with changes to shape, decoration, and finish. Forms are usually squat and cylindrical, thick but lightweight. Dishes, bowls, and tea utensils are most common. Pieces can be grey, red, or white, painted with iron oxide or decorated with glaze. is a generic term for a family of pottery glazes. They tend to range in color from milky white to orange, sometimes with charcoal grey spotting, known as \\"carbon trap\\" which is the trapping of carbon in the glaze during the firing process.Jacobson, Mel. \\"Black Shino\\", Ceramics Monthly, December 2000. Available on-line at Ceramics Monthly . The term also refers to Japanese pottery made with the Shino glaze (see Shino-yaki). Firings of Shino tend to be of lower temperature for a longer period of time, and then a slow cooling process. Due to Shino glazes' low fluxing temperatures, they should be applied before any other glazes. These conditions do not allow the glaze to melt fully, and the result is a thick glaze that often has a crawling pattern. If Shinos are applied on top of most glazes, the off-gassing from the underglaze will bubble through the Shino, resulting in undesirable pitting and other defects. There is also a class of Shino glazes, called \\"Crawling\\" Shino, which are intentionally formulated to exhibit a glaze defect known as crawling. These Shinos form small, regular spots of bare clay all over the surface of the pot, some going so far as to cause the glaze to bead up on the surface of the clay.

The film stars Sonny Chiba as Iron Sharp (called Space Chief in the U.S. version). The film was released in 1961 in Japan and was later released in the United States on television. In 1998, the film was featured on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Plot  Astronomer Shinichi Tachibana has a secret identity as superhero \\"Iron Sharp\\" (changed to \\"Space Chief\\" in the English dub) and has many children as friends. When they are attacked by a group of metallic aliens (\\"Neptune Men\\" in English), Iron Sharp drives the aliens away. The resourceful Tachibana helps develop an electric barrier to block the aliens from coming to the Earth. After several losses by the aliens, they announce that they will invade the Earth, throwing the world into a state of panic. The aliens destroy entire cities with their mothership and smaller fighters. After Iron Sharp destroys multiple enemy ships, Japan fires a nuclear missile at the mothership, destroying it.  Cast  * Sonny Chiba as scientist Shinichi Tachibana / Iron Sharp * Kappei Matsumoto as Dr. Tanigawa * Ryuko Minakami as Yōko (Tanigawa's daughter) * Shinjirō Ehara as scientist Yanagida * Mitsue Komiya as scientist Saitō Style Invasion of the Neptune Men is part of Japan's tokusatsu genre, which involves films in the science fiction and/or superhero films that involve heavy use of special effects.  Production  Sonny Chiba as Iron Sharp fights aliens. Invasion of the Neptune Men was an early feature film for Sonny Chiba. Chiba started working in Japanese television where he starred in superhero television series in 1960. Chiba continued working back and forth between television and film until the late 1960s when he became a more popular star.  Release  Invasion of the Neptune Men was released in Japan on 19 July 1961. The film was not released theatrically in the United States, but was released to American television by Walter Manley in 1964. On October 11, 1997 the film was shown on the movie- mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000. In his review of the film, Bruce Eder of AllMovie described the episode as a memorable one, specifically the cast watching the repetitive aerial dogfights between spaceships, and one of the hosts remarking that \\"Independence Day now seems like such a finely nuanced movie\\". The film was also released as Space Chief, Space Greyhound and Invasion from a Planet.  Reception  In later reviews of the film, Bruce Eder gave the film a one star rating out of five, stating that the film was \\"the kind of movie that gave Japanese science fiction films a bad name. The low-quality special effects, the non-existent acting, the bad dubbing, and the chaotic plotting and pacing were all of a piece with what critics had been saying, erroneously, about the Godzilla movies for years.\\" The review stated that the films \\"cheesy special effects and ridiculous dialogue taking on a sort of so-bad-they're-good charm.\\" and that the film was \\"thoroughly memorable (if not necessarily enjoyable, outside of the MST3K continuum) specimen of bad cinema.\\" In his book Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, Stuart Galbraith IV stated that the film \\"had a few surprises\\" despite a \\"woefully familiar script\\" Galbraith noted that the film was not as over-the-top as Prince of Space and that the opticals in the film were as strong as anything Toho had produced at the time. Galbraith had suggested the effects may have been lifted from Toei's The Final War from 1961.

Best known as the founder of Dazed and Confused magazine (along with Jefferson Hack), and for his photography of models including Kate Moss and Heidi Klum, celebrities such as Madonna and David Bowie and his portrait of Elizabeth II. His work has appeared in magazines such as GQ, Vogue and Marie Claire. In 2011 Rankin started the biannual fashion, culture and lifestyle magazine, Hunger and launched Rankin Film to produce and direct his own commercial and editorial film work. Early life Brought up in Scotland and Yorkshire, Waddell attended Thirsk School and Sixth Form College. Career Whilst studying accounting at Brighton Polytechnic, he realised that his interests lay elsewhere and dropped out, taking up the study of photography at Barnfield College Luton and then London College of Printing. During this time, Rankin met Jefferson Hack, with whom he formed a working relationship. In 1992 the two decided to start a magazine together called Dazed & Confused. In December 2000 Rankin launched his own quarterly fashion magazine, Rank. He also publishes Another Magazine, Another Man and more recently Hunger, a website and biannual fashion and lifestyle magazine. In 2002, Rankin was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by The Royal Photographic Society. In April 2009 Rankin created Annroy, a contemporary structure designed by Trevor Horne Architects that is home to Rankin’s own photographic studio, gallery and living space, where he lives with his wife and model Tuuli Shipster. Each month Annroy holds a different exhibition, which features some of Rankin’s current work. In 2010, Rankin travelled to South Africa with the BBC to shoot the documentary, South Africa in Pictures The same year, Rankin was commissioned by Nike and Bono’s Product Red in the fight against HIV/AIDS, to shoot a global Nike campaign, Lace Up Save Lives, to raise awareness about the disease. In 2011 Rankin served as the photography teacher in the Channel 4 series Jamie's Dream School featuring Jamie Oliver. He also presented the BBC Four documentary America in Pictures - The Story of Life Magazine. In May 2012 it was confirmed that Rankin would be re-shooting Azealia Banks's music video for her single \\"Liquorice\\". In January 2014, BBC 4 broadcast his 1 hour documentary Seven Photographs that Changed Fashion, in which he created his own tributes to images by Cecil Beaton, Erwin Blumenfeld, Richard Avedon, Helmut Newton, Herb Ritts, David Bailey and Guy Bourdin. He interviewed an array of original photographers, models and assistants, and used contemporary models including Heidi Klum, Erin O'Connor, Jade Parfitt, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Tuuli Shipster, Mollie Gondi, Daphne Guinness and David Gandy.BBC Four, Profile of Seven Photographs that Changed Fashion Rankin was involved with television reality show Britain's Missing Top Model. The show followed eight young women with disabilities who competed for a modeling contract, which includes a photo shoot with Rankin and a cover photo in Marie Claire. Rankin has shot for Germany's Next Topmodel, where he was a guest judge, and regularly works with the winner of Cycle 2 of Britains Next Top Model Lianna Fowler. Rankin has donated his services to publicity campaigns for the charitable organisation Women's Aid, providing photographs for use in the What's it going to take? and Valentine's Day campaigns. In 2019, Rankin designed a digital philanthropy card in collaboration with Phil Ropy for Surfrider Foundation Europe. The card features the environmental non-profit organisation which has been fighting to protect and preserve the ocean since 1990. Rankin created a Plastic Monster made of plastic waste for the card, as a metaphor for plastic pollution. It was released on 7 August 2019. The cards' proceeds are redistributed to the organization. Controversy In February 2011, Rankin expressed the opinion that \\"in America the Jewish zealots are so powerful.

Images are produced using contrast medium by subtracting a \\"pre-contrast image\\" or mask from subsequent images, once the contrast medium has been introduced into a structure. Hence the term \\"digital subtraction angiography\\". Subtraction angiography was first described in 1935 and in English sources in 1962 as a manual technique. Digital technology made DSA practical from the 1970s. Procedure =DSA and fluoroscopy= In traditional angiography, images are acquired by exposing an area of interest with time-controlled x-rays while injecting contrast medium into the blood vessels. The image obtained includes the blood vessels, together with all overlying and underlying structures. The images are useful for determining anatomical position and variations, but unhelpful for visualizing blood vessels accurately. In order to remove the distracting structures to see the vessels better, first a mask image is acquired. The mask image is simply an image of the same area before the contrast is administered. The radiological equipment used to capture this is usually an X-ray image intensifier, which then keeps producing images of the same area at a set rate (1 to 7.5 frames per second). Each subsequent image gets the original \\"mask\\" image subtracted out. (Mathematically, the incoming image is divided by the mask image.) The radiologist controls how much contrast media is injected and for how long. Smaller structures require less contrast to fill the vessel than others. Images produced appear with a very pale grey background, which produces a high contrast to the blood vessels, which appear a very dark grey. The images are all produced in real time by the computer or image processor, while the contrast is injected into the blood vessels. =Intravenous digital subtraction angiography= Intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV- DSA) is a form of angiography which was first developed in the late 1970s. IV- DSA is a computer technique which compares an X-ray image of a region of the body before and after radiopaque iodine based dye has been injected intravenously into the body. Tissues and blood vessels on the first image are digitally subtracted from the second image, leaving a clear picture of the artery which can then be studied independently and in isolation from the rest of the body. Some limited studies have indicated that IV-DSA is not suitable for patients with diabetes or kidney failure because the dye load is significantly higher than that used in arteriography. However, IV-DSA has been used successfully to study the vessels of the brain and heart and has helped detect carotid artery obstruction and to map patterns of cerebral blood flow. It also helps detect and diagnose lesions in the carotid arteries, a potential cause of strokes. IV-DSA has also been useful in assessing patients prior to surgery and after coronary artery bypass surgery and some transplant operations. Applications DSA is primarily used to image blood vessels. It is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of arterial and venous occlusions, including carotid artery stenosis, pulmonary embolisms, and acute limb ischaemia; arterial stenosis, which is particularly useful for potential kidney donors in detecting renal artery stenosis (DSA is the gold standard investigation for renal artery stenosis); cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The future DSA is done less and less routinely in imaging departments. It is being replaced by computed tomography angiography (CTA), which can produce 3D images through a test which is less invasive and stressful for the patient, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), which avoids X-rays and nephrotoxic contrast agents.

Support came from a layer of closely packed leaf bases just below the surface of the trunk, while the center was filled with pith. The long, thin grasslike leaves were attached directly to the stem and grew in a spiral along the trunk. The old leaf bases expanded as the trunk grew in width, and left a diamond-shaped pattern, which is evident in fossils. These leaf scars were arranged in vertical rows. The trunk had photosynthetic tissue on the surface, meaning that it was probably green. The trunk was topped with a plume of long, grass-like, microphyllous leaves, so that the plant looked somewhat like a tall, forked bottle brush. The plant bore its spores (not seeds) in cone-like structures attached to the stem.Sebastián González, D. and Celia Gutiérrez, M. (2014). El Bosque Petrificado de Olta: 300 millones de años después Sigillaria, like many ancient lycopods, had a relatively short life cycle - growing rapidly and reaching maturity in a few years. Some researchers have suggested that Sigillaria was monocarpic, meaning that it died after reproduction, though this is not proven.Encyclopedia of life It was associated with Lepidodendron, the scale tree, in the Carboniferous coal swamps.

Myron Cohen (July 1, 1902 – March 10, 1986) was an American comedian and raconteur. A son of Barnett and Rebecca Feinstein Cohen, Myron Aaron Cohen was born in Grodno, Russia (now Hrodna, Belarus), and came to America as a little boy. The oldest of three brothers, he grew up in Manhattan, and later lived in the Bronx with his wife Miriam (née Hyman), whom he married in 1925. She died in 1981. Cohen began as a salesman in the New York City garment industry. When calling on customers, before showing his samples, he would tell a joke to put everyone at ease and establish a friendly mood. Cohen’s jokes were often more popular than his garment samples, and his customers urged him to become a professional comedian. He was a nightclub entertainer in the 1950s and 1960s, recording several live record albums and also frequently appearing on TV variety programs such as The Ed Sullivan Show. During the 1950s, when there were numerous nightclub showroom venues throughout the nation, he was one of the top headliners in the same league as Sophie Tucker, Ted Lewis, Ray Vasquez, Jimmy Durante, and Joe E. Lewis, among others. Compared with many star performers, he was not aloof, and was very affable and approachable in public. Although he spoke perfect, cultured English, he was a master at capturing the ethnic accents of the Jewish citizens of New York City. Cohen suffered a heart attack at age 83 and died at Nyack Hospital, where he had been taken from his home in New City, New York. Cohen is interred at Cedar Park Cemetery, in Emerson, New Jersey. Trivia In the Woody Allen movie Sleeper (1973 film) Cohen, along with fellow comedian Jackie Mason, had uncredited voice cameos as the Jewish \\"Ginsberg and Cohen\\" robot tailors since 2173.

Ryan (born February 21, 1946) is an American lawyer and politician who served two four-year terms as Illinois Attorney General. A career Republican, he received his party's nomination and ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Illinois against Rod Blagojevich in 2002. He has been a professor at Benedictine University since 2003. He again ran for governor in 2010 and led incumbent Governor Pat Quinn in aggregate polling; but he failed to gain his party's nomination, coming in fourth in a field of seven candidates. As of 2019, he is the last Republican to have been Illinois Attorney General. Education Ryan was born in Chicago, Illinois. Ryan's father Edward Ryan was a construction worker while his mother was an Italian immigrant housewife. He attended a Benedictine-run high school, Saint Procopius Academy (now Benet Academy). Upon graduating, Ryan went on to study at Saint Procopius College (now Benedictine University), where he obtained his bachelor of arts degree in political science in 1968. He then went on to Chicago-Kent College of Law where he obtained his J.D. in 1971. Career Ryan entered the legal profession having found a position with the DuPage County State's Attorney office. After three years, he was promoted to first Assistant State's Attorney. In 1976, Ryan left the public sector to enter private practice. He worked at an independent law firm until 1984. That year, Ryan entered his first political race and won. He was sworn in as DuPage County State's Attorney, becoming the highest ranking prosecutor in the district. He was re- elected in 1988 and again in 1992. =Illinois Attorney General= Considered by local media as the most successful prosecutor in the state of Illinois, Ryan was urged to run for the state's highest legal office. In 1994, Ryan won an election to become Illinois Attorney General. He was reelected in 1998 with the endorsement of every major newspaper in the state. Ryan's most notable accomplishment as Illinois Attorney General was his $9.1 billion settlement from tobacco companies.

With his younger sister Virginia and brother Arthur they pose with their mother Alice Littell Cobb, M.D., recently widowed. Humphrey Cobb (September 5, 1899 - April 25, 1944) was an Italian-born, Canadian-American screenwriter and novelist. He is known for writing the novel Paths of Glory (1935),The phrase 'paths of glory' is a quotation from Thomas Gray's Elegy (1751): 'The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r, // And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave, // Awaits alike the inevitable hour. // The paths of glory lead but to the grave.' which was made into an acclaimed 1957 film Paths of Glory by Stanley Kubrick. Cobb was also the lead screenwriter on the 1937 film San Quentin, starring Humphrey Bogart. Life Cobb was born in Siena, Italy. He served with the Canadian Army for three years during the First World War and fought in the Battle of Amiens. Stephen E. Tabachnick, in the Afterword to the U of Georgia Press' 1987 reprint of Paths of Glory supplies additional details of Cobb's life and how the son of American parents, Arthur Cobb, an artist, and his wife Alice Littell Cobb, a physician, came to be mistakenly identified as a Canadian author. It had much to do with Cobb's many years as an expatriate living in foreign locations, and his decision to take part in World War I in 1916, well before the United States entry into the war, by joining the Canadian Army. Cobb's parents sent him to school in England for his primary education and only at age 13 did he come to the United States to continue his schooling. After being expelled from high school at age 17, he traveled to Montreal to enlist in a Canadian regiment. Following the war, Cobb worked in the stock trade, the merchant marine, publishing, advertising, and the Office of War Information (the US spy agency before OSS & CIA) writing overseas propaganda. He wrote Paths of Glory, while employed by George Gallup at New York's Young & Rubicam advertising agency. Cobb wrote a second less well received novel, None But the Brave, which was serialized in Collier's Weekly in 1938. From 1935 to 1940 he was employed as a screenwriter. At the time of his death, Cobb was an advertising copywriter for the New York firm of Kenyon & Eckhardt. Another American writer named Cobb, the unrelated Irvin S. Cobb, also wrote a World War I book called Paths of Glory (1915), a non-fiction account of his journalistic experiences during the war.Paths of Glory, by Irvin S. Cobb. \\"Paths of Glory\\" is also the title of at least three non-World War I books, by Anthony Clayton (2007), Stephen Brumwell (2008), and Jeffrey Archer (2009), and with variations the phrase has appeared in the longer titles of more than a dozen books.

He was born Gheorghe Grossmann in Pădureni, Arad County. In the 1980s, he emigrated to Israel, but later returned to Bucharest, where he died. Born into a Jewish family, Marin studied electrical engineering at Grenoble, France (between 1936 and 1941). A member of the French Resistance, he was given charge of the FTP-MOI's south-western region. In July 1944 he instigated the revolt at the Tarn mines, one of the first steps in the French liberation from German occupation. In August 1944, Gaston liberated the French city of Carmaux, capturing 120 German soldiers. A few days later, he also liberated Albi, the capital of the Tarn region. After the start of Communist Romania, he became Councillor of the Romanian Council of Ministers in 1945–1949 and Minister of the Economy in 1948–49; he was part of Romania's delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. From 1949 to 1954, Gaston Marin was Minister of Electrical Energy and Electrical Industry, and then, up to 1965, President of the Planning Committee. In 1955–1966, he served as President of State Committee for Nuclear Energy, and was (1962–1969) Vice-president of the Ministerial council, as well as Minister of Metallurgy, Mining, Chemistry, Transport and Telecommunications, Building, Chemical Industry, and National Trading. In 1963, after attending John F. Kennedy's funeral, he established diplomatic relations with the Western world, including the United States. Those steps were highly encouraged by the US government and US President Lyndon B. Johnson, and gained Romania a privileged communist country status. From 1969 to 1982, Marin was President of the Pricing Committee, until being removed from official positions by Ceaușescu, being by far the last Gheorghiu- Dej supporter to be eliminated from the Romanian government. In his youth, he was a member of Poalei Zion and, in the 1980s, made aliyah (emigrated to Israel), but returned to Romania. He had three, or more, children: Ileana, Jackie (married to Radu Osman, emigrated to Israel), and son Minu (physicist at MIT, born in France, deceased).

Using parametric polymorphism, a function or a data type can be written generically so that it can handle values identically without depending on their type. Such functions and data types are called generic functions and generic datatypes respectively and form the basis of generic programming. For example, a function \`append\` that joins two lists can be constructed so that it does not care about the type of elements: it can append lists of integers, lists of real numbers, lists of strings, and so on. Let the type variable a denote the type of elements in the lists. Then \`append\` can be typed :\`forall a. [a] × [a] -> [a]\` where \`[a]\` denotes the type of lists with elements of type a. We say that the type of \`append\` is parameterized by a for all values of a. (Note that since there is only one type variable, the function cannot be applied to just any pair of lists: the pair, as well as the result list, must consist of the same type of elements.) For each place where \`append\` is applied, a value is decided for a. Following Christopher Strachey, parametric polymorphism may be contrasted with ad hoc polymorphism, in which a single polymorphic function can have a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied. Thus, ad hoc polymorphism can generally only support a limited number of such distinct types, since a separate implementation has to be provided for each type.  History  Parametric polymorphism was first introduced to programming languages in ML in 1975.Milner, R., Morris, L., Newey, M. \\"A Logic for Computable Functions with reflexive and polymorphic types\\", Proc. Conference on Proving and Improving Programs, Arc-et-Senans (1975) Today it exists in Standard ML, OCaml, F#, Ada, Haskell, Mercury, Visual Prolog, Scala, Julia, Python, TypeScript, C++ and others. Java, C#, Visual Basic .NET and Delphi have each introduced \\"generics\\" for parametric polymorphism. Some implementations of type polymorphism are superficially similar to parametric polymorphism while also introducing ad hoc aspects. One example is C++ template specialization. The most general form of polymorphism is \\"higher-rank impredicative polymorphism\\". Two popular restrictions of this form are restricted rank polymorphism (for example, rank-1 or prenex polymorphism) and predicative polymorphism. Together, these restrictions give \\"predicative prenex polymorphism\\", which is essentially the form of polymorphism found in ML and early versions of Haskell.  Higher-ranked polymorphism  = Rank-1 (prenex) polymorphism = In a prenex polymorphic system, type variables may not be instantiated with polymorphic types. This is very similar to what is called \\"ML-style\\" or \\"Let-polymorphism\\" (technically ML's Let-polymorphism has a few other syntactic restrictions). This restriction makes the distinction between polymorphic and non-polymorphic types very important; thus in predicative systems polymorphic types are sometimes referred to as type schemas to distinguish them from ordinary (monomorphic) types, which are sometimes called monotypes. A consequence is that all types can be written in a form that places all quantifiers at the outermost (prenex) position. For example, consider the \`append\` function described above, which has type :\`forall a. [a] × [a] -> [a]\` In order to apply this function to a pair of lists, a type must be substituted for the variable a in the type of the function such that the type of the arguments matches up with the resulting function type. In an impredicative system, the type being substituted may be any type whatsoever, including a type that is itself polymorphic; thus \`append\` can be applied to pairs of lists with elements of any type—even to lists of polymorphic functions such as \`append\` itself. Polymorphism in the language ML is predicative. This is because predicativity, together with other restrictions, makes the type system simple enough that full type inference is always possible. As a practical example, OCaml (a descendant or dialect of ML) performs type inference and supports impredicative polymorphism, but in some cases when impredicative polymorphism is used, the system's type inference is incomplete unless some explicit type annotations are provided by the programmer. = Rank-k polymorphism = For some fixed value k, rank-k polymorphism is a system in which a quantifier may not appear to the left of k or more arrows (when the type is drawn as a tree). Type inference for rank-2 polymorphism is decidable, but reconstruction for rank-3 and above is not. = Rank-n (\\"higher-rank\\") polymorphism = Rank-n polymorphism is polymorphism in which quantifiers may appear to the left of arbitrarily many arrows.  Predicativity and impredicativity  = Predicative polymorphism = In a predicative parametric polymorphic system, a type \\\\tau containing a type variable \\\\alpha may not be used in such a way that \\\\alpha is instantiated to a polymorphic type. Predicative type theories include Martin-Löf Type Theory and NuPRL. = Impredicative polymorphism = Impredicative polymorphism (also called first-class polymorphism) is the most powerful form of parametric polymorphism. A definition is said to be impredicative if it is self-referential; in type theory this allows the instantiation of a variable in a type \\\\tau with any type, including polymorphic types, such as \\\\tau itself. An example of this is the System F with the type variable X in the type T = \\\\forall X. X \\\\to X, where X could even refer to T itself. In type theory, the most frequently studied impredicative typed λ-calculi are based on those of the lambda cube, especially System F.  Bounded parametric polymorphism  In 1985, Luca Cardelli and Peter Wegner recognized the advantages of allowing bounds on the type parameters. Many operations require some knowledge of the data types, but can otherwise work parametrically. For example, to check whether an item is included in a list, we need to compare the items for equality. In Standard ML, type parameters of the form ’’a are restricted so that the equality operation is available, thus the function would have the type ’’a × ’’a list → bool and ’’a can only be a type with defined equality. In Haskell, bounding is achieved by requiring types to belong to a type class; thus the same function has the type {\\\\scriptstyle Eq \\\\, \\\\alpha \\\\, \\\\Rightarrow \\\\alpha \\\\, \\\\rightarrow \\\\left[\\\\alpha \\\\right] \\\\rightarrow Bool} in Haskell. In most object-oriented programming languages that support parametric polymorphism, parameters can be constrained to be subtypes of a given type (see Subtype polymorphism and the article on Generic programming).

He started his broadcast news career as a producer at WNBC in 1974, eventually becoming an anchor/reporter until he left for WNEW (later WNYW) in 1985. He became the station's political reporter until he began co-anchoring Good Day New York in 1988, a position he held until 2005, when WNYW threw an on-air retirement celebration for him. He was known for often wearing a black leather blazer during the broadcast. A few months later, he was \\"lured out of retirement\\" (according to weatherman and friend Dave Price), when he was hired to join the anchor team at CBS 2 News This Morning. Ryan (and the other anchors) were replaced in April 2006 in a major shake-up at WCBS-TV. In the mid-1990s, Ryan also hosted A Current Affair. On July 19, 2001, Ryan had an on-air argument with Dick Oliver during a segment on a landlord-tenant dispute,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzG3wdF_IU an incident that would later inspire a series of sketches on Saturday Night Live where cast member Bill Hader would portray elderly reporter \\"Herb Welch\\".

Along with her two husbands, Stewart Farrar and Gavin Bone, she has published \\"some of the most influential books on modern Witchcraft to date\\". According to George Knowles, \\"some seventy five percent of Wiccans both in the Republic and Northern Ireland can trace their roots back to the Farrars.\\" Farrar has been one of the most public faces of Wicca, having appeared as a model for book covers and illustrations in several of the best-read books on the subject. She is a frequent guest lecturer on the subjects of Wicca, Neopaganism and witchcraft in North America and Europe. Early life Janet Owen was born in Clacton in 1950. Her family, of mixed English, Irish and Welsh descent, were members of the Church of England. She attended the Leyton Manor School, and the Royal Wanstead High School girls' school. After high school, Janet worked as a model and receptionist. Wicca She was initiated into Alexandrian Wicca by the tradition's founders, Alex and Maxine Sanders. She met the Sanders in 1970 through a friend who had become interested in exploring Wicca. Janet accompanied her friend to keep the friend \\"out of this weird cult\\", but she instead joined the Sanders coven, and would go on to become, in the words of Knowles, one of \\"England's most eminent and respected modern day witches.\\" In the coven she met Stewart Farrar, her future husband and co-author. Janet and Stewart Farrar were both elevated to the second degree \\"in an unoccupied house in Sydenham\\" by the Sanders on 17 October 1970, and they received the third, and final, degree of initiation in their flat on 24 April 1971. Both events are well-recorded by Stewart Farrar down to the smallest detail in his diaries. Stewart Farrar at home, 1999 The Farrars began running their own coven in 1971, before their third degree initiation ceremony. They were handfasted in 1972 and legally married in 1975. Janet Farrar left the coven in 1972 to explore Kabbala with a ceremonial magic lodge, but returned the same year. In 1976 the Farrars moved to Ireland to get away from the busy life of London. They lived in County Mayo and County Wexford, finally settling in \\"Herne Cottage\\" in Kells, County Meath. Both husband and wife went on to publish a number of books on the Wiccan religion and on coven practises. Farrar continued to model and appeared in the illustrations to multiple early books about Wicca, including the cover of the paperback version of Margot Adler's 1979 Drawing Down the Moon. Farrar also posed for many of the photographs in their 1981 Eight Sabbats for Witches, which included material the authors claimed to be from the Alexandrian tradition's Book of Shadows. The Farrars, with the support of Doreen Valiente, argued in the book that even though the publishing of this material broke their oath of secrecy, it was justified by the need to correct misinformation. Janet Farrar indicates that some of the rituals contained in the couple's books were actually written by them, and that they left the Alexandrian tradition after the book's research was complete. The couple co-authored four more books on Wicca. Janet Farrar's post-Alexandrian practice has been referred to as \\"Reformed Alexandrian\\". They were joined by Gavin Bone in 1993, with whom they entered into a \\"polyfidelitous relationship\\". The three of them would co-author two more books, The Healing Craft and The Pagan Path, an investigation into the many varieties of Neopaganism. Stewart Farrar died in February 2000 after a brief illness. Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone married in a handfasting in May 2001, and then legally married in Northern Ireland (part of Ulster) in March 2014. After Stewart Farrar's death, Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone continued to author books, and have given a number of lectures on Wicca in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and in Britain. The title of their 2004 book, Progressive Witchcraft, is the description that the couple prefers for their current religious practice. This was re-released in 2013 as a new edition called Inner Mysteries. Their current area of work is in trance-prophesy, trance-possession and ecstatic ritual and they are currently working on a major book on the subject which they hope to release with Acorn Guild Publishing in 2014. They are also founders of The Alliance of Progressive Covens, which includes linked groups and covens in the United States, Ireland and Italy.

The main function of a headstock is to house the pegs or mechanism that holds the strings at the \\"head\\" of the instrument. At the \\"tail\\" of the instrument the strings are usually held by a tailpiece or bridge. Machine heads on the headstock are commonly used to tune the instrument by adjusting the tension of strings and, consequentially, the pitch of sound they produce.  Construction details  Bass guitar headstock Two traditional layouts of guitar tuners are called \\"3+3\\" (3 top tuners and 3 bottom ones) and \\"6 in line\\" tuners, though many other combinations are known, especially for bass guitars and non-6-string guitars. When there are no machine heads (i.e. tuners are not needed or located in some other place, for example, on guitar body), the guitar headstock may be missing completely, as in Steinberger guitar or some Chapman stick models. Schematic section shows both straight and angled headstocks. Note the β angle between the surface of the neck and headstock surface The headstock may be carved separately and glued to the neck using some sort of joint (such as a scarf joint). There are two major trends in headstock construction, based on how the string will go after passing the nut. The advantages and disadvantages of both trends are very debatable and subjective, so these two variants are used: * Straight headstocks form a single plane with a flat surface of neck (and fingerboard). This makes the neck and headstock easier to manufacture; they can be constructed from a single piece of wood. Fender usually uses non-angled, straight headstocks. Because of the low angle of the string over the nut, string trees may be used to avoid the string coming out of the nut while playing. * Angled headstocks form some kind of acute angle with a surface of neck. The value of \\"magic angle\\" (called headstock pitch) that gives the best tone and stability is also very debatable, but it is usually in a range from 3° to 25°. For example, various manufacturers and particular guitar models use:  Guitars * 4°: Guild * 11°: Martin * 12°: Bigsby, Yamaha SGV * 13°: Peavey, Warmoth * 14°: Gibson Firebird V and VII, Gibson X-plorer, some vintage Gibson guitars, Washburn, most budget Epiphone replicas of Gibson models * 17°: Gibson ES-335, Gibson Les Paul, Gibson SG, Epiphone Casino  Bass guitars * 10°: all Gibson basses * 12°: Yamaha SBV * 14°: most Epiphone replicas of Gibson models * 24°: Kinal Luthiers of both styles frequently cite better sound, longer sustain and strings staying in tune longer as advantages of each style. Fragile construction is cited as a disadvantage of each style too: single-piece necks are more likely to break on occasional hit and are harder to repair, while glued-in necks can break with time. Apart from its main function, the headstock is an important decorative detail of a guitar. It is the place where overwhelming majority of guitar manufacturers draw their logo. Some guitars without machine heads (for example, ones equipped with Floyd Rose SpeedLoader) have a headstock for purely decorative reasons.  Signature headstock outlines  Headstock from an ARTCORE series guitar by Ibanez Ibanez JEM 555 BK headstock Details of a Seagull Guitar headstock. Most major guitar brands have signature headstock designs that make their guitars or guitar series easily recognizable. As seen in a section below, even \\"copied\\" at the first glance designs retain clear visible changes in dimensions, proportions of elements, etc., so it is almost always possible to tell a major brand of a guitar by looking at headstock. = Fender-like curved 6-in-line headstocks = Image:Fender headstock telecaster.svgFender Telecaster Image:Fender headstock normal.svgFender Stratocaster, regular version, used on modern Mexican and American-built guitars (other than the Highway One (Upgrade) series), as well as the brief- lived Korean-made Fender Stratocaster of the early 1990s.

Generally, matched-headstock models carry a price premium over their plain counterparts due to the extra processes involved in the finishing process. Although Fender no longer offers matched headstocks on production models made in the United States or Mexico, certain models from Fender Japan are available with matched headstocks. The definition of a \\"matched headstock\\" varies between manufacturers and players - for example, the headstocks of Gibson guitars are nearly always black, and it is debatable whether a black-bodied Gibson has a matching headstock. Generally, a guitar is only considered to have a matching headstock if the guitar is usually produced without matching body and headstock finishes.

History  The origins of Hagi ware can be traced back to the arrival of Korean potters to Hagi, a quaint town situated in Yamaguchi Prefecture on the Japan Sea, following Japan’s military invasion of the Korean peninsula in the late 16th century. As a result, a large number of Korean craftsmen were abducted and transported to Japan, where they played a crucial role in establishing new pottery types such as Satsuma, Arita, and Hagi ware (\\"hagi yaki\\"). The local feudal lord of the Hagi area at the time, Terumoto Mouri, had appointed potters in a castle town of Matsumoto (presently the city of Hagi) in order to create Hagi wares for his personal tea ceremonies and as gifts. The potters in Matsumoto steadily increased their production so that more kilns were established in Fukawa territory (presently the city of Nagato) during the mid-17th century. However, due to the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the potters employed by Lord Mouri were dismissed and began to run their own independent businesses. Gradually, more kilns were built outside of Hagi, spreading to the Miyano area of Yamaguchi city and also to other parts of the southwest region of Yamaguchi Prefecture. Thus, Hagi ware production continued throughout the Edo era. The tradition of tea ceremonies and tea houses continue to this day in Hagi, which in turn created demand for vessels. Some well-known tea ceremony artists include Koraizaemon Saka XI and Koraizaemon Saka XII (高麗左衛門), Sakata Deika XIII (坂田泥華), Tobei Tahara XII (田原陶兵衛) and Yū Okada (岡田裕). Another expert is Miwako Masaki. A non- Japanese artist is Bertil Persson, a Swede. Characteristics Hagi ware chawan with matcha green tea, by Yū Okada (2011)The subtle form and natural, subdued colors of Hagi ware are highly regarded. In particular, the beautiful contrast between the bright green color of matcha [tea] and the warm neutral tones of Hagi ware is aesthetically notable. Regarding tea wares, there is a famous expression in Japanese that is \\"Raku first, Hagi second and Karatsu third\\". This old tea adage indicates the rank of tea wares preferred for tea ceremonies. It implies that tea wares with distinguishing characteristics of earthy feel and looks are most valued. Two types of fine-grained soft clay are used as the base material. The earth is first mixed with water, then strained. During the process, wood chips are often added, causing the less dense parts to rise while the heavier parts sink to the bottom. This preparation process is repeated for two weeks until the water is entirely filtered without any residues, and the pure, fine clay is obtained from the bottom of the vat. The reddish to orange color of the clay is important as it will determine the texture and color of the Hagi surface. The beauty of Hagi ware is appreciated not only for its earthy colors but also for the glaze. The translucent beige glaze is to draw out the natural, deep colors of the clay. After being heated in the kiln, the glaze creates its signature fine web of cracks and fine pores -known as kan-nyuu (貫入) or crazing- while cooling. Throughout the heating and cooling process, the cracks form because the glaze shrinks faster than the clay. Over time, a Hagi ware user might notice the color of the glaze getting darker. This is natural as the slightly porous surface absorbs the tea residues or sake through its tiny crackles, maturing over time. One might also notice a chip on the bottom, which was deliberately made by local pottery makers to sell the ware to merchants instead of presenting them as gifts to the Mōri clan during the Edo period. Even today, Hagi ware continues to evolve in a response to the demands of customers, the aesthetic preferences of Hagi artists, and the environment. =White Hagi= oni (demon) Hagi bowl, by Shibuya Deishi, 20th century The white Hagi was developed by the Miwa family, one of the most highly regarded potting families in all of Japan. Their kiln was established in Kanbun 3 (1663) in the Matsumoto area of Hagi in order to produce tea utensils for Lord Mori Terumoto. Successive generations of Miwa potters have produced all sorts of works besides tea ware, including Raku ware (Kyusetsu I and IV studied in Kyoto), figurines of mythical creatures (Kyusetsu VI and VII), and vessels for the table. In the 1930s, Miwa Kyuwa (Kyusetsu X) revitalized the Hagi tea world with his warm and sensuous chawan and other tea utensils. He adjusted the old pottery recipe by altering how the straw was burned and mixing it into the glaze solution to ultimately create a purer shade of white. Later, his younger brother Miwa Jusetsu (Kyusetsu XI) added power and strength with his Oni-Hagi (devil-Hagi) chawan. The brothers were named as living national treasures by the Japanese government for their Hagi wares in 1970 and 1983, respectively. Jusetsu’s eldest son is Ryosaku, who is now known as Kyusetsu XII because his father passed on the honor to him in April 2003. The mixture for the black glaze contains high levels of iron and enhances the contrast with the white glaze. The mixture for the white glaze contains Feldspar and wood ash. It is initially black and very thick in its viscosity, particularly noticeable in the way it flows down the vessel. Typically, the potter dips the vessel into the vat with the glaze for the white, and in extracting the vessel he or she can move the vessel around for the glaze to drip slowly in the direction desired. The aim is for the slowly dripping glaze to add dimension and movement to the piece - for example, in expressing the passage of time through the flow of the drip. The carbon in the glaze then evaporates during firing and turns into a translucent white, with the high iron glaze in black emerging from under the background. The rich white glaze that coats the vessel and the black glaze in the background create a strong contrast with each other.  Literature  * Wilson, Richard L. Inside Japanese Ceramics.

It is affiliated to the Ceylon Federation of Labour (CFL). History Omnibus transport first began in Sri Lanka as an owner-operated service. There was no regulation, so when more than one bus operated on a single route there was a scramble for the load, which might end in fisticuffs or even stabbings. The setting up of the limited liability omnibus companies by the British around 1940 was the first meaningful step to regularise public passenger transport in this country. The employees were treated abominably: one owner allegedly tied a bus conductor to a tree and spanked the poor man for failing to bring in the targeted collection for the day. Trade union work was an uphill task and members of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) had to proceed in secret, disguising themselves to avoid company thugs. J. Wanigatunga was one of the union agents so deployed. In February 1936 the LSSP was able to take leadership in a spontaneous island-wide 2-day strike of motor workers that took place against the motor laws which provided for the cancellation of driving licences for trivial offences. There was opposition from the Ceylon Labour Party of A.E. Goonesinghe, which went so far as to provide employers with blacklegs (scabs) to break strikes led by the Samasamajists. However, the organisation of the bus workers went forward slowly. A strike wave in May 1941 affected the workers on the Fort-Mount Lavinia bus route. On 22 November 1945 the Motor Workers Union launched its island-wide bus strike. N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena, Somaweera Chandrasiri, W.J. Perera, George Perera and Leslie Goonewardene (who had just returned from India after underground work in the independence movement there) were arrested and prosecuted for supporting a strike in an essential service. However, the strike was a success, and the bus owners, who were the most stubbornly anti-union section of the capitalists in Sri Lanka had made important concessions. In the Jaffna peninsula, the organisations of the bus workers came over to the Motor Workers Union. =Hartal= On the eve of the Hartal 1953, on 11 August 1953, the South- Western Bus Company workers came to a strike decision and its owner, Mr Cyril de Zoysa, stated to union representatives that he left his employees free to act as they thought best. It thereby became certain that the biggest bus operator in Sri Lanka would not function on 12 August. The news about the SW Bus Co had been sent to other bus lines by LSSP leaflets the same evening. However, certain bus owners announced of that they would run their buses, whatever the situation. The general public, among whom they were anyway not very popular, directed their anger against these defiant owners. This was especially true of the Gamini Bus Co Ltd and the High Level Road Bus Co Ltd. Their buses were stopped, stoned, and smashed by the angered people. Their principal routes were then blocked at numerous points with felled trees, so that even a military escort could not get their buses through. It was not for several that these companies could resume their normal services. On the other hand, the South Western Bus Company was able to resume most of its services promptly after 12 August. Their routes had not been unduly blocked; their vehicles had largely escaped damage. =Ceylon Transport Board= Immediately after the nationalisation of the bus companies in 1958, the Motor Workers’ Union successfully concluded negotiations with the Ceylon Transport Board on many demands, amongst which was the payment of Government rates of cost of living allowances to the employees. However, both in 1961 and 1963 C.T.B. employees won further gains only through major strikes. The bus workers joined in a strike on 8 January 1967 aimed at protection of concessions won over the past several years. As a result, the union suffered heavy victimisation – which was later rectified by the law courts as well as by government intervention after the United Front election victory in 1970. Again in the General Strike of 1980, the bus workers faced victimisation, including assault by the goons of the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS) who, with government backing attacked other workers with bicycle chains and iron bars.

Its story revolves around a homicide detective (De Niro) and a fire marshal (Burns) who join forces to apprehend a pair of Eastern European murderers (Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov) videotaping their crimes in order to become rich and famous. The title is a reference to the Andy Warhol quotation, \\"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\\" Plot Ex-convicts Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) arrive in the United States to claim their part of a bank heist in eastern Europe. Oleg steals a video camera from an electronics store. At the rundown apartment of their old partner, they are denied their share of the spoils, so Emil fatally stabs the partner and his wife as Oleg tapes it with the camera. Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga) witnesses the murders from the bathroom, then escapes before Emil and Oleg can kill her as well. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is a New York City arson investigator assigned to the case. Also at the scene is Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro), is a high-profile detective who is followed by his girlfriend Nicolette Karas (Melina Kanakaredes), a reporter from the tabloid TV show Top Story. Flemming and Warsaw agree to work the case together. While checking out the crowd, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention, but she disappears. Meanwhile, Emil calls an escort service and asks for a \\"Czech girl.\\" Oleg tapes Emil as he kills the escort (Noelle Evans) and learns the address of the escort service. Oleg continually films everything, claiming he wants to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate this murder and visit the escort service. The madam, Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron), tells them that the girl Warsaw described doesn't work for her but rather a hairdresser. She mentions a couple of other guys having just asked her the same questions. Flemming and Warsaw arrive at the hair salon just after Emil and Oleg have warned Daphne to keep quiet. Flemming notices Oleg filming them from across the street. In the ensuing foot chase, Flemming's regular partner Leon Jackson (Avery Brooks) is hit with a glass bottle and his wallet is stolen. Emil finds a card with Flemming's name and address. He becomes jealous of Flemming's celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in America can get away with anything. On the night Flemming plans to propose to his girlfriend Nicolette Karas (Melina Kanakaredes), Oleg and Emil sneak into his house and bind Flemming to a chair. While Oleg is recording, Emil explains that he plans to kill Flemming and sell the tape to Top Story. After getting himself committed to an insane asylum, Emil will declare that he is actually sane. Since he can't be tried again, he will get off, collecting royalties from books and movies based on his crimes. Flemming attacks them with his chair (while still taped to it), but Emil gets the upper-hand and stabs him in the chest, mortally wounding him. Emil then suffocates and kills Flemming with a pillow. The entire city is in mourning. Emil sells the tape of Flemming's murder to Top Story anchor Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer) in exchange for $1 million, outraging Warsaw and the entire police force. Emil and Oleg watch the tape's broadcast on Top Story inside a Planet Hollywood; customers realize that Emil and Oleg are sitting with them and panic. Police arrive and arrest Emil, while Oleg escapes. Warsaw takes Emil to an abandoned warehouse to kill him, but other police arrive just in time and take Emil into custody. Everything goes as planned for Emil, now a celebrity who is pleading insanity. His lawyer agrees to work for 30% of the royalties Emil will receive for his story. Meanwhile, in hiding, Oleg becomes jealous of the notoriety that Emil is receiving. While the lawyer is leading Emil away in court, Warsaw provokes an argument, with the Top Story crew recording the whole thing. Oleg quietly approaches Hawkins and hands him the tape of Emil explaining his plan to Flemming, proving he was sane the whole time. Hawkins shouts out to Emil about the evidence in his possession. Emil grabs a policeman's gun, shoots Oleg and grabs Nicolette, threatening to shoot her. Against orders, Warsaw shoots Emil a dozen times in the chest to avenge Flemming's murder. Hawkins rushes to Oleg's side as he dies. He attempts to get a comment from Warsaw, who punches him and walks away as the police all smile with approval.

It was originally slated to be released by New Line Cinema in the spring of 2000, with theatrical trailers appearing in late 1999. For reasons unknown, the film was pulled from the spring 2000 schedule and then delayed until the following year, on March 9, 2001.

Chief Records owner/songwriter/producer Mel London is credited as the songwriter. Considered a blues standard, it is Junior Wells's best-known song. \\"Messin' with the Kid\\" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and has been recorded by a variety of blues and other artists. Background and composition \\"Messin' with the Kid\\" is an up-tempo twelve-bar blues which alternates between Afro-Cuban- and Little Richard-style rhythmic accompaniment. According to Junior Wells, the title was inspired by his young daughter Gina. Mel London arrived early at Wells' home to pick him up for a scheduled recording session: \\"'Where's you Daddy at? Get him up'. 'No, you said you were goin' to be here at nine o'clock. It's not nine o'clock... You're not goin' to be messin' with the kid'\\". \\"The Kid\\" was a nickname for Wells. Later in the studio, they needed another song for the session: \\"one thing led to another and... it took us five minutes, maybe ten minutes and we had it\\". Recording and releases Wells recorded \\"Messin' with the Kid\\" in Chicago in 1960. He sings the song, but unlike most of his early singles, Wells does not play harmonica. The backup is provided by Earl Hooker on guitar, Johnny \\"Big Moose\\" Walker on piano, Jack Myers on bass, Fred Below on drums, Jarrett Gibson on tenor saxophone, and Donald Hankins on baritone saxophone. Chief Records (owned by the song's writer Mel London) released the song on a single in 1961. In 1966, Wells recorded a second version of \\"Messin' with the Kid\\". It features a different rhythm arrangement and includes a harmonica solo by Wells with backup by Buddy Guy on guitar along with Myers and Below. The song was released on the 1966 blues compilation Chicago/The Blues/Today! Vol. 1. Wells and Guy used a similar arrangement for \\"Snatch It Back and Hold It\\" on their influential Hoodoo Man Blues album (1965). The duo later recorded several live versions of the song, including in 1977 for Live in Montreux. Recognition and legacy In 1998, the Blues Foundation inducted \\"Messin' with the Kid\\" into the Blues Hall of Fame as a \\"Classic of Blues Recordings – Singles or Album Tracks\\". In a 1998 press release, the Foundation noted: \\"Messin' with the Kid\\" inspired later songs. Soon after the Chief single, Muddy Waters recorded an answer song titled \\"Messin' with the Man\\" for Chess Records in 1961. In 1977, blues singer Eddie C. Campbell recorded a Christmas novelty song, titled \\"Santa's Messin' With the Kid\\" (on King of the Jungle), in which Santa is \\"messing with\\" the wife of the Kid, until \\"The Kid ran him out o' town\\": References Category:1960 songs Category:Junior Wells songs Category:1960 singles Category:Blues songs Category:Songs written by Mel London ","title":"Messin' with the Kid"},{"id":"3390266","text":"The Scott Report (the Report of the Inquiry into the Export of Defence Equipment and Dual-Use Goods to Iraq and Related Prosecutions) was a judicial inquiry commissioned in 1992 after reports of arms sales to Iraq in the 1980s by British companies surfaced. The report was conducted by Sir Richard Scott, then a Lord Justice of Appeal. It was published in 1996. Much of the report was secret. Background In the late 1980s, Matrix Churchill, a British (Coventry) aerospace quality machine tools manufacturer that had been bought by the Iraqi government, was exporting machines used in weapons manufacture to Iraq. According to the International Atomic Energy Authority, the products later found in Iraq were among the highest quality of their kind in the world. They were 'dual use' machines that could be used to manufacture weapons parts. Such exports are subject to government control, and Matrix Churchill had the appropriate government permissions, following a 1988 relaxation of export controls. Crucially, however, this relaxation had not been announced to Parliament – indeed, when asked in Parliament whether controls had been relaxed, the then-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry replied incorrectly that they had not. Matrix Churchill was contacted by HM Customs and Excise, under suspicion of exporting arms components to Iraq without permission. It had this permission but this was denied by the government, in line with the most recently announced policy on the matter. Matrix Churchill's directors were therefore prosecuted in 1991 by Customs and Excise for breaching export controls. The trial did not go well for the government – public interest immunity certificates obtained by the government to suppress some critical evidence (supposedly on grounds of national security) were quickly overturned by the trial judge, forcing the documents to be handed over to the defence. The trial eventually collapsed when former minister Alan Clark admitted he had been 'economical with the actualité in answer to parliamentary questions regarding what he knew about export licenses to Iraq. Report The Scott Report represents possibly the most exhaustive study produced to that date of the individual responsibility of ministers to Parliament. Scott comments on the difficulty of extracting from departments the required documents (some 130,000 of them in all) and notes how Customs and Excise could not find out what Ministry of Defence export policy was, and how intelligence reports were not passed on to those who needed to know. The Economist commented that \\"Sir Richard exposed an excessively secretive government machine, riddled with incompetence, slippery with the truth and willing to mislead Parliament\\". The report characterised the nature of the government as: Scott identified three main areas of democratic concern. First, the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 was emergency legislation passed at the outbreak of the Second World War. It allowed the government to issue regulations which were not subject to resolutio Parliament, for the duration of the emergency, which would make it a criminal offence to export particular goods to particular countries. While the Act should have been lapsed in 1945, it remain in force, and had been modified in 1990 so as to become part of the Import and Export Control Act 1990.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/45 The second area was the failure of ministerial accountability; the principle that \\"for every action of a servant of the crown a minister is answerable to Parliament\\". The third area was that of public-interest immunity certificates, which had been issued during the Matrix Churchill trial. As a result of these certificates, innocent men were in danger of being sent to prison, because the government would not allow the defence counsel to see the documents that would exonerate their clients. While some of these contained potentially sensitive intelligence material, many were simply internal communications: the certificates were intended to protect the ministers and civil servants who had written the communications, rather than the public interest. Scott states:  Publication  The publication of the report was seen by many as the nadir of the 1990s Conservative governments of the UK. Prior to the report's publication, those ministers who were criticised were given the opportunity to comment and request revisions. The 1,806-page report was published, along with a press pack which included a few relatively positive extracts from the report presented as if representative of the entire report, at 3:30pm. Given a then largely pro-government press, this proved effective at stalling an extensive analysis in the media. The report had to be debated in Parliament. Ministers criticised in the report were given advanced access to the report and briefed extensively on how to defend themselves against the report's criticisms. In contrast, according to senior Labour MP Robin Cook, the opposition were given just two hours to read the million-plus words, during which scrutiny they were supervised and prevented from making copies of the report. Finally, the Prime Minister, John Major, stated that a vote against the Government would be in effect a vote of no confidence, ensuring that Conservative MPs would not vote against, while a vote for was a vote exonerating the Government of any wrongdoing. Robin Cook worked with a team of researchers to scrutinise the report, and delivered \\"what was regarded as a bravura performance\\".http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4127676.stm Nonetheless, the Government won the vote 320–319.

He also was a law professor and attorney in private practice.https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-konop-53294136 In 2006, Konop was elected to a four-year term as Lucas County (Ohio) Commissioner. He ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Toledo, Ohio in 2009. During the campaign a heckler booed him and called him a liar for going back on his pledge to remain in his county commissioner seat until his full term was up. A video of the booing incident went viral on YouTube and was spoofed on Comedy Central's South Park. Konop's interview about his political career and the incident was part of The Huffington Post's 2017 Webby nominated podcast series “Candidate Confessional” with Sam Stein and Jason Cherkis. Konop also ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic Party candidate in Ohio's 4th congressional district for the United States House of Representatives in 2004. Early life Konop received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. At Emory he worked at the Washington DC office of Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur. In 2000, Konop earned his law degree from The University of Michigan and afterwards practiced law at Fulbright & Jaworski, LLP. While at the firm, he assisted in the launch of a mentoring program for at-risk junior high school students in Washington, D.C. Ohio's 4th congressional district candidate In 2004, Democrat Konop ran against the incumbent Republican U. S. Representative Mike Oxley, of the 4th congressional district of Ohio. Oxley, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, had been a congressman since 1981. Though Oxley won, the margin of victory was 48,037 votes; his smallest since 1990. Konop garnered 41.4% of the votes, highest total ever by an opponent of Oxley, who spent ten times more than Konop in the campaign. He became the first federal candidate of the Democratic Party to win Allen County since 1932. During the debates, Oxley focused on his influence and Konop's inexperience while Konop claimed his opponent abandoned his district and took undue credit for the Sarbanes–Oxley Act. Following the campaign, Konop served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at Ohio Northern University and a Visiting Assistant Professor of Law at the University of Toledo. Konop also taught Political Science at Blufton University. Lucas County Commissioner In 2006, Konop campaigned successfully for a Lucas County (Ohio) Commissioner, soundly defeating City Council member George Sarantou by promising to bring fresh perspectives to the county government. Konop won the election by over 40,000 votes, 89,928 to 49,768.http://co.lucas.oh.us/DocumentCenter/View/2217 As Commissioner, Konop instituted a countywide microchip scanning program for dogs to help return lost pets to their owners. About 8,000 dogs were scanned for microchips.\\"Lucas County to scan lost dogs for microchip\\". March 10, 2007. Konop also successfully pushed for the resignation of Lucas County Dog Warden due, in large part, to the high kill rate for dogs at the Lucas County Dog Pound. Under mounting pressure, the Dog Warden retired in January 2010.\\"'Pit- bull' pup freed from Lucas County Pound\\". December 15, 2009. Since the Dog Warden's exit, there have been 407 fewer dogs killed than in 2009 and 939 fewer than in 2008. In November 2009, Konop made a successful motion to adopt a moratorium that banned the Dog Warden from killing puppies, including Pit Bull puppies, at least through 3 months of age. Konop was featured in a documentary, “Guilty ‘Til Proven Innocent” for his work advocating for animal rights. During his time in office, he also helped to eliminate the use of county no-bid contracts by introducing a resolution that ended the practice of awarding contracts worth more than $5,000 for professional services without a formal bid process. Konop also authored a resolution for greater transparency of politicians’ campaign donors, passed a policy against nepotism in county hiring, and led a community effort to preserve the Children's Wonderland exhibit. In 2009, Konop objected to the lack of economic and racial diversity on the Lucas County Planning Commission and gave up his own position on the board to Jim Snodgrass, Jr, an African American UAW factory worker at Jeep In spring of 2009, Konop revealed his proposal for a $70 million publicly funded scholarship program aimed to increase the number of college-educated county residents without raising taxes. His proposal was rejected by the other two commissioners and Konop cited the resolution's defeat as his greatest disappointment during his service. Mayor of Toledo candidate In 2009, while still serving as the Lucas County Commissioner, Konop began his campaign for the office of mayor of Toledo. Opponents raised doubts about Konop's integrity, since in 2006 he pledged to complete the four-year term as commissioner. In defense, Konop cited his greater obligation to bring changes urgently needed in Toledo, which has seen higher unemployment, increase in foreclosure problems, more possibility of police layoffs, and a larger deficit since 2006. Konop's campaign for mayor received unflattering local and national attention thanks to a YouTube video in which he is repeatedly heckled during a news conference. Konop chose Old West End for the location, at the corner of Winthrop Street and Parkwood Avenue, where his mother grew up. When the filming began, a man who lived nearby named Maxwell Austin intentionally mispronounced Konop's name, labeled him a liar, and booed him. Konop eventually met with Austin to address their common concerns about the city. Konop later participated in a follow-up video intending to spoof the heckler episode which brought him further negative coverage. The events harmed his campaign, and out of the six candidates for mayor, Konop finished in fifth place. Konop served the remainder of his term as the Commissioner. Boo Ben Konop Day He also has a tribute done in his honor by former national radio icon and current D.C. & Milwaukee radio icon Steve Czaban called \\"Boo Ben Konop Day\\" on the day after the MLB All-Star game given that there's nothing else to talk about on that day in regards to sports.https://theteam980.com/steve-czaban- show/https://thegamemke.iheart.com/featured/the-steve-czaban- show/content/2019-07-10-happy-boo-ben-konop-day/ Toledo Blade columnist Later, Konop was employed as a columnist for the Toledo Blade where he covered the Detroit Tigers, Bob Dylan's first ever concerts in China and Vietnam, and the first 2011 Republican Presidential debate in New Hampshire. Enforcement attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Since 2011, Konop has worked at the CFPB and currently serves as Senior Litigation Counsel in the Office of Enforcememt at the Bureau. At the CFPB, in 2016 Konop was lead Bureau counsel on CFPB vs. Bridgepoint, in which the Bureau took action against Bridgepoint Education, Inc., a for-profit college chain for “deceiving students into taking out private student loans that cost more than advertised.” Bridgepoint paid a penalty of $8 million to the CFPB and forgave and refunded loans to students totaling $23.5 million. In addition, Konop is lead Bureau counsel on CFPB vs. RD Legal in which the CFPB and the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against RD for allegedly scamming 9/11 Ground Zero first responders and National Football League concussion victims out of money intended to cover their medical costs. In CFPB vs. Gamber, Konop served as lead Bureau counsel in a lawsuit with the Arkansas Attorney General against businesses brokering contracts offering high-interest credit to veterans, many of them disabled, who agreed to sell their retirement or disability benefits in exchange for a lump-sum payment. Federal law prohibits agreements under which another person acquires the right to receive a veteran's pension payments. The settlement calls for up to a $2.7 million penalty. In a related case where Konop served as lead Bureau counsel, military veterans, many of them disabled, who lost their pensions will receive over $9 million in compensation. Konop served as lead Bureau counsel in CFPB vs. Village Capital, a lawsuit against a mortgage lender accused of deceiving military veterans into refinancing their mortgages that resulted in a $260,000 fine and full restitution to all veterans who were victims of the deception, and CFPB vs. Top Notch in which the CFPB alleged that the defendants offered deceptive loans to injured former NFL players, victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and 9/11 first responders. That case resulted in a civil money penalty and lifetime industry bans for the defendants . Konop was lead counsel on CFPB v. Sancho and worked on CFPB vs. Corinthian Colleges and CFPB vs. Genuine Title. Konop also represented the Bureau in a federal court contempt proceeding against mortgage broker Gary Klopp which resulted in a $525,000 disgorgement order by the court related to violations of a settlement agreement in a mortgage kickback scheme. Executive Vice President, National Treasury Employee Union at the CFPB (Chapter 335) In 2012, Konop helped found a chapter of the National Treasury Employee Union at the CFPB. In 2013 he was elected Executive Vice President of the chapter and served on the bargaining committee that negotiated the CFPB's first collective bargaining agreement. In 2014, Konop helped lead the union's efforts to combat race, gender and age bias within the CFPB. This work resulted in a suspension and reorganization of the performance management review system and $5.5 million in back pay being awarded to employees. On May 21, 2014, the House Financial Services Committee on Oversight conducted a congressional hearing on issues related to discrimination at the CFPB. Konop was subpoenaed by the committee as a witness and testified before Congress, highlighting his union members' concerns regarding pay equity and disparate impact affecting minorities, women, and employees over 40. In his testimony, Konop specifically cited the 2012 Performance Management Ratings (PMR) distribution between management and labor that revealed the disadvantage the bargaining unit employees faced. When the same problems resurfaced in the 2013 PMR, the chapter requested a detailed PMR breakdown based on categories of race, age, and bargaining unit status. The unfavorable results led to grievances, bargaining, and eventual admittance of systemic issues of discrimination within the CFPB's PMR system.

Wasow says BlackPlanet's home-grown software allows users to move between personal pages, to dating, chat, and message boards, focusing on connecting people, rather than feeding them content. =Statistics= In January 2007, the membership log on BlackPlanet's home-page boasted 15.8 million registered users since its inception in 1999. At time of purchase the site had around 20 million members and was the fourth most-visited U.S. social networking site. Target Audience *Male 34.4% *Female 65.6% *Median Age: 32 *Attended/Grad College: 64.5% *Composition Black: 88% \\"BlackPlanet creates branded profile pages to integrate advertisers into the social community, enabling members to engage as friends\\"; as well as personal profiles BlackPlanet also allows pages for brands, personalities, and products. In 2009, BlackPlanet introduced new features to the website, including a Facebook-style status update, and a news bar that keeps users up-to-date with information shared on Interactive One and BlackPlanet. The chat function was also updated in 2009; the current chat is powered by a company called Chat Blazer and is Flash based. In early 2010, BlackPlanet launched a new homepage that included an Activity Feed, allowing users to see updates from everyone on BlackPlanet, either friends or by location. =Other features= right BlackPlanet has recently introduced two interactive games for users, Farmandia and Fishdom. BlackPlanet describes Farmandia as follows: \\"Farmandia puts you in the farmer's seat. Grow your produce, care for your animals and build your barns. The more you play, the more points you're rewarded so you can keep your farm in business. Need a little help? Invite other BlackPlanet members to lend a hand.\\" BlackPlanet describes Fishdom thusly; \\"When you're done spending time on the farm, grab your virtual fishing rod and head to Fishdom where you're responsible for feeding your exotic collection of underwater friends. You better earn your bucks because they get mighty hungry. You never know when you'll need to purchase more food, accessorize your underwater kingdom or give your fish some new friends.\\" The similarities to Facebook's Farmville have not gone unnoticed by the BlackPlanet users, who point out the need for improvement of the site's infrastructure and principal features such as chat prior to the introduction of games. Mobile applications BlackPlanet also introduced mobile apps in 2009 for mobile phones. The application BlackPlanetMobile was free when it was introduced but was not exclusive of mobile provider charges. BlackPlanetMobile did not work on the BlackBerry, GPhone, iPhone, or Sidekick smartphones when introduced. BlackPlanet Text Alerts are also available to alert users to updates and notifications. This is an opt-in service. Social networks It has been stated that online social networks have come to define the modern Internet experience. BlackPlanet, as a precursor to Facebook and Myspace, has gone some way to influencing the Internet as users recognise it. Before today's popular networks allowed you to \\"like\\" posts, \\"poke\\" crushes, or \\"retweet\\" celebrities, web-savvy African Americans were connecting on BlackPlanet. Wasow himself has stated\\" As of June 2007, BlackPlanet had 16.5 million members and 80 million page views. It was described as the largest online media entity for African-Americans and \\"the granddaddy of social- networking sites\\". BlackPlanet enjoyed more than 6 million unique visitors a month in April 2008. In 2007, BlackPlanet found itself to be the fourth most popular social networking tool on the internet, but with the vast increase in Facebook, Twitter and MySpace usage, BlackPlanet fails to gain recognition in the top 15 social networks according to eBizMBA, in March 2011, leading critics to suggest that 'BlackPlanet has fallen to the wayside as other networks have taken the social network mantle.' BlackPlanet utilises other social networking tools such as Twitter and Facebook in order to reach new and potential users. Its Twitter feed is updated on a near daily basis, commenting and highlighting points of interest to the black community. Recent tweets include: \\"83% of BP voters think non-Black rappers shouldn't use the #nword... what do you think about that?\\" and, \\"Weave secrets revealed. Go from drab to fab in 5 minutes.\\" The BlackPlanet Twitter feed is also used to post announcements and updates regarding the BlackPlanet site itself. Wider political issues are also mentioned, including: \\"What will you do #ifgovernmentshutsdown?\\" The BlackPlanet Facebook page is used to encourage discussion of issues both directly and indirectly applicable to its community of African-American users. The Facebook status update feature is used to ask questions to the page followers, and is well responded to in general. Questions have included, \\"What do you think of the idea of Black Marriage Day?\\", \\"What do you think of people using the term 'ghetto' when describing something that's not desirable?\\", and, \\"Men, do you ever pamper yourself with a gentleman's facial, manicure or pedicure? Ladies, what do you think of men who take care of their skin and nails?\\" Both social networking tools are used to advertise the \\"Member of the Day\\" feature, drawing attention to the appearance of the chosen member. Accompanying a link to the member's profile is a short comment such as, \\"She's beautiful, she's single, she's our member of the day. Check her out\\", and, \\"Still need proof that we have the prettiest members on the planet? You're welcome.\\" Ethics Wasow says he occasionally gets questions about whether BlackPlanet is fostering racial separatism. \\"Voluntarily socializing with people who share your interests is what freedom is all about,\\" he says. \\"Anybody can join any of the sites. We found we were not segregating the web.\\" However, niche community tools such as BlackPlanet do host users who wish to promote separatism, such as gangs, and this has not gone unnoticed. \\"Gangs have had a presence on the Internet since its inception. This became noticeable during the 1990s when it became fashionable for gangs to use free webspace from internet service providers to put up their own gang webpage.\\" Finding gangs on GeoCities, blackplanet, and especially Myspace, along with other internet service providers (ISPs), provided the foundation of what today is known as gang internet investigation, a specialized area of expertise in gang investigation. Gary Dauphin, an original employee of BlackPlanet, argues that while the ethnicity of the site's owners is important to understanding the site, owners of one ethnicity can sometimes serve an audience of another ethnicity. \\"BlackPlanet, where I got my start on the Web, was owned for most of its early life by a largely Asian American group, and I would venture that that period was the site's finest hour. The ownership wasn't African-American, but it did understand the underlying call to service implied in running an ethnic site, and moreover, they had high ambitions for their company as a Web community platform provider that raised the bar for BP overall.\\" Lawsuit In October 2011, an anonymous model filed a federal lawsuit against BlackPlanet.com regarding a 2007 incident in which she was drugged and raped by two men who met the woman through the website. The two men (40-year-old Lavont Flanders, Jr. and 45-year-old Emerson Callum) were convicted by a federal jury in Miami in December 2011 of multiple sex-related and conspiracy charges and were sentenced to life in prison. The woman alleges that BlackPlanet.com \\"failed to warn women about the dangers of sexual predators\\". The site's parent company told the Miami Herald it \\"vehemently\\" denies the allegations. In the press In 2007, BlackPlanet was featured in the press when the U.S. Department of Defense or the Pentagon banned it amongst other sites in order to free up bandwidth, suggesting high usage levels. Other banned sites included: filecabi.com, Hi5, iFilm, Metacafe, MTV.com, Myspace, Pandora Radio, Photobucket, StupidVideos, and YouTube. The Defense network contains more than 15,000 local and regional networks and more than five million computers in the grid. BlackPlanet gained considerable publicity when then-Senator Barack Obama began using the site on October 5, 2007, during his presidential campaign bid. Within 10 days, he had gained nearly 200,000 friends. In an online poll conducted by the site, over 2/3 of BlackPlanet's online community stated their intention to vote in the 2008 election. The media perceived this participation in a niche social networking tool to be a \\"smart move\\" by the Senator. On March 30, 2011, President Obama had 450,579 friends on BlackPlanet. The page continues to be updated with regular blog posts, but does not feature recent status updates.

One of two sixfold screens. Quail Feeding Amidst Susuki and Kikyo, by Matsumura Keibun (1830) Shōka arrangement by the 40th headmaster Ikenobō Senjō, from the Sōka Hyakki, by Matsumura Keibun and Yokoyama Seiki (1820) The , also known as the Maruyama–Shijō school, was a Japanese school of painting.  History  It was an offshoot school of the Maruyama school of Japanese painting founded by Maruyama Ōkyo, and his former student Matsumura Goshun in the late 18th century. This school was one of several that made up the larger Kyoto school. The school is named after the Shijō Street (\\"Fourth Avenue\\") in Kyoto where many major artists were based. Its primary patrons were rich merchants in and around Kyoto/Osaka and also appealed to the kamigata who were of the established aristocrat and artisan families of the Imperial capital during the late 18th/19th centuries.  Style  Stylistically, the Shijō style can best be described as a synthesis of two rival styles of the time. Maruyama Ōkyo was an experienced and expert painter of sumi-e ink paintings, and accomplished a great degree of realism in his creations, emphasizing direct observation of depicted subjects which was a direct contravention of the officially sponsored schools of the time, Kanō and Tosa, which emphasized decorativeness with highly formalized and stylized figures taught to its students via copying paintings of past masters. The Kanō and Tosa schools had become bywords for rigid formalism by this time. Meanwhile, a number of artists, rebelling against Ōkyo's realism, formed the nanga (\\"southern pictures\\") school, basing their style largely on the Southern school of Chinese painting. The artists of the Shijō school sought to reconcile the differences between these two styles, creating works that synthesized the best elements of both. The school's style focuses on a Western-influenced objective realism, but achieved with traditional Japanese painting techniques. It concentrates less on the exact depiction of its subject, but rather on expressing the inner spirit and usually has an element of playfulness and humor compared to the Maruyama school. Popular motifs include tranquil landscapes, kachō (bird and flower), animals, and traditional subjects from Chinese poetic and Confucian lore, but there is generally little or no interest in legends, history, or classical literature.Japanese Paintings and Prints of the Shijō School. New York: The Brooklyn Museum, 1981.  Artists  One of the most well-known Shijō artists in the West is Mori Sosen, who is known for his great number of paintings of monkeys.

He was the first Croatian Army general to be found guilty of war crimes by a Croatian court, in 2003, after his case was transferred from The Hague to Zagreb. He was released on probation in November 2011. Military service Mirko Norac (also known as Mirko Norac Kevo) was born in the village of Otok, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, now part of the Republic of Croatia. He attended school in Sinj. Soon after the first multi- party elections in Croatia in August 1990, he joined the Ministry of Interior. On 12 September 1990 he joined the Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit, a unit of the Croatian police. As a member of the Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit, he took part in early activities by the Croatian police forces including the Plitvice Lakes incident. =Gospić Operations= In September 1991 Norac left the police force and moved to Gospić, where he took part in the assault against local Serbs and Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) units. The town was surrounded from 3 sides. The JNA barracks, the Stanko Opsenica (with around 70 officers and 200 soldiers, plus numerous Serbian paramilitaries) were all trapped inside. After four days of siege, led by Norac, the JNA surrendered the barracks. In mid- September 1991 Norac was appointed commander of the 118th Brigade of the Croatian Army. One month later he took part in event known as the Gospić massacre when between 100-120 local Serbs were murdered by men under his command. Norac became the youngest colonel of the Croatian Army, and was appointed commander of the 118th Brigade of the Croatian Army. =Maslenica and Medak= In November 1992 Norac was named the commander of the 6th Guards Brigade which was soon renamed to the 9th Guards Motorised Brigade. He took part in Operation Maslenica in early 1993. He went on to command Operation Medak Pocket, during which time war crimes against the local ethnic Serb population were committed. In the operation Norac was wounded in both hands and legs by an unexploded land mine. Article on Mirko Norac, Slobodna Dalmacija, 17 February 2001 (part 2)] He spent a month in a Zagreb hospital, then returned to Gospić. In 1994 he was promoted to brigadier and appointed commander of the Gospić Operational Zone. That same year he was named the annual voivode (\\"Duke of Alka\\") in the Alkarsko društvo celebration. The Mayor of Zagreb, Milan Bandić, and other top Croatian officials attended the event.Slavodobitnik Ante Poljak, najstariji alkar, s čak tri sride, Jutarnji.hr, 6 August 2006 =Operation Storm and after= Norac took part in Operation Storm in August 1995. On 25 September 1995 he was promoted to the rank of Major General. On 15 March 1996, Norac was appointed commander of the Knin Corps District. The President of Croatia, Stjepan Mesić, discharged Norac from the Croatian Army on 29 September 2000 after he signed the so-called Twelve Generals' Letter against what was claimed to be \\"criminalization\\" of the Croatian War of Independence. War crimes =Gospić killings= On 16 October 1991 Tihomir Orešković (Secretary of Lika Crisis Headquarters) called a meeting to organise the killing of ethnic Serb civilians in the area. During that meeting a list of local Serbs to be murdered was formulated. Norac reportedly attended the meeting, among a group of masked and unmasked soldiers and civil policemen, which later raided houses in Gospić and took custody of ethnic Serb civilians, informing them that they were to be interrogated. He organised and directed the executions of the civilians in a desolate area near the town, executing one woman himself. Those murdered included Radmila Stanić, Branko Kuzmanović, Branko Štulić, Stanko Smiljanić, Radojka Diklić, Mirjana Kalanj, Đorđe Kalanj, Dane Bulj, Milan Pantelić, Mileva Orlović, Miloš Orlović, Radovan Barać, Ljubica Trifunović, Petar Lazić, Borka Vraneš, Bogdan Šuput, Dušanka Vraneš, Nikola Gajić and Željko Mrkić. On 8 February 2001, an arrest warrant for Norac (then living in Zagreb) was issued by the Ministry of Interior. The fugitive asked the Zagreb police if he could turn himself in at Rijeka, to avoid the media. He was allowed to do so but used the opportunity to escape. Sixteen days later (on 22 February) he turned himself in, denying all charges.\\"Hero or war crimes suspect?\\", bbc.co.uk; accessed 13 July 2015. On 5 March 2001, an indictment against Norac, Orešković, Stjepan Grandić, Ivica Rožić and Milan Canić was issued, accusing them of the murder of 50 civilians at Karlobag, Pazarište and Lipova glavica. The trial at Rijeka County Court lasted for 14 months and over 150 witnesses testified, including Croatian soldiers and civilians. On 24 March 2003, Norac was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Orešković and Grandić were sentenced to 15 and 10 years, and Rožić and Canić were acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence. Norac served his sentence in Glina, where he was allowed, on at least one occasion, to go home for a weekend to visit family in Sinj. He was released on probation in November 2011, after serving no more than eight years.Norac, Petrač i Sulić izašli iz zatvora, index.hr; accessed 13 July 2015. =Operation Medak Pocket= On 20 May 2004, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) issued an indictment against Norac (and Rahim Ademi and Janko Bobetko) for crimes committed during Operation Medak pocket in 1993. The indictment stated that as a result of the Croatian military operation: \\"... the Medak Pocket became uninhabitable. The villages of the Pocket were completely destroyed, thereby depriving the Serbian civilian population of their homes and livelihood.\\" Norac was accused of having \\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation or execution of persecutions of Serb civilians of the Medak Pocket on racial, political or religious grounds\\", and of the \\"mutilation and desecration of the body of Boja Pjevać; the public killing of Boja Vujnović by burning her alive\\". On 8 July 2004, Norac was transferred to an ICTY courtroom in The Hague where he pleaded not guilty to all five charges brought against him. The judge ruled that he did not have to remain in the ICTY prison and could be returned to prison in Croatia. On 14 September 2005, the ICTY decided to transfer the case to Croatian jurisdiction as the first ICTY case to be transferred to a local court. (Bobetko had died in the interim.) The trials of Norac and Ademi began at Zagreb County Court in June 2007 and ended on 30 May 2008. Norac was found guilty of failing to stop soldiers under his command from killing and torturing Serbs, and was sentenced to an additional seven years concurrent imprisonment. Lawsuit The Croatian state attorney's office launched a case on 17 December 2013 to force Norac to pay 111,000 euros, the amount awarded in damages to relatives of victims in two separate wartime incidents.\\"Croatia Sues Wartime General Mirko Norac\\", balkaninsight.com, 18 December 2013; accessed 13 July 2015.

He was the last Holocaust era Rebbe to lead a Hasidic sect.  Early years, education, and World War II  In his youth, he studied in Vizhnitz under the Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Eliezer Hager. Before World War II began Portugal and his father left their hometown of Sculeni in Moldova (the town from which derives the name of the Hasidic sect that they led) and went to Chernowitz in Ukraine, where they spent the Second World War.  Soviet occupation  After the war father and son went to Bucharest, Romania. The senior Portugal was arrested several times by the Soviets, who ruled Romania until 1968. In April 1959 the pair were arrested and accused of treason. After a big outcry and through the work of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson Rabbi Eliezer Silver of Ohio and other world Jewish figures, United Nations officials facilitated their release. They were released in September 1959, and arrived in the U.S. in August 1960 after the U.S State Department offered them U.S. citizenship.  Brooklyn  Rabbi Portugal lived primarily in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn but spent some time including about half of the Jewish holidays in Williamsburg, Brooklyn where his father lived. He was widely sought after for his blessings and advice. He deprived himself of bodily pleasures by sleeping very little, not sleeping in a bed and eating no more than one meal a day. He was also known for his battles against modernities such as watching television and use of internet. He encouraged shaving the scalp except for boys under three and unmarried girls. He was a composer of Hasidic songs. He always (except on Shabbat and Jewish Holidays) carried with him a small tape recorder to record any new tune that would come to his mind. He composed thousands of songs. Most of them were forgotten after they were recorded, but many of them were sung at his tishen, and a handful of them have become classics in the Hasidic community. Rabbi Portugal had close ties with many Hasidic rebbes. He headed the Chesed L'Avraham charity organization in Israel founded by his father, and was actively involved - traveling worldwide - in fundraising for it. Following the death of his wife, Reizel (daughter of Rabbi Menachem Ze'ev Stern of Oberwischau), in 2005, he changed some of his practices, including traveling less and wearing his peyos hanging down rather than tied around his ears. Family Portugal's wife, Reizel, died in 2005. Portugal had five sons and three daughters. =Sons= *Rabbi Yeshaya Yaakov Portugal, Skulener Rebbe Shlit\\"a in Boro Park, use to live in Montreal, Canada – oldest son of Rabbi Yisroel Avrohom Portugal.

The purpose of the Barristers is to address the professional needs and development of Black lawyers in the City of Philadelphia through programs such as seminars, cultural events and publications. In 1973, members of the Barristers’ Association served on the Liacouras Commission, which investigated ways to eliminate racial discrimination in Pennsylvania Bar admission procedures. In 1978, the Barristers’ Association joined other concerned groups in filing an action against the Philadelphia Registration Commission which resulted in the addition of 50,000 Philadelphians to the voter registration pools. In 1983, the Barristers’ Association provided testimony before the Pennsylvania State Legislature on the issue of the merit selection of judges. In more recent years, the Barristers’ Association has sponsored or participated in activities that promoted youth awareness and career opportunities in the legal profession, and increased citizens’ awareness of their rights under the law. Scholarships to minority law students at local law schools are awarded annually to further encourage and support Black students in their pursuit of a degree in law. Continuing legal education seminars and political education forums are offered to members of the Barristers’ Association to facilitate professional development and political awareness. Today, the Barristers’ Association continues to provide a very important and unique role for its members by providing a forum for discussion and dissemination of information of matters of particular interest to Black attorneys and the Philadelphia Black community at large. The Barristers' offers an attorney referral program to its members. In 2016, the Barristers' opposed House Bill 1538, which aimed to prohibit public officials from publicly releasing the names of police officers who used firearms or force to seriously injure civilians until the end of an official investigation. Some of its signature programs include the Annual Thanksgiving Turkey Drive, the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Annual Memorial Breakfast and accompanying Day of Service Project, the Annual Awards and Scholarship Gala, and the Annual Expungement Clinic. The Barristers’ Association’s membership encompasses a network of approximately 1,000 lawyers and jurists who serve society at the highest positions in both the private and public sectors of the legal profession. As an affiliate of the National Bar Association, the Barristers’ Association is an active participant in a community of practicing Black lawyers, judges and law students in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Organization The Barristers’ Association’s structure consists of an Executive Committee and an Advisory Board. The Executive Committee is responsible for the operation of the organization and is composed of elected officers and appointed members. The Advisory Board, which is made up of distinguished members of the legal profession, provides advice and counsel to the Executive Committee.

A ceramic xiao flute player excavated from an Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD) tomb in Sichuan province Several dongxiao in the G-key.

In the oral traditions of the Xiao, practitioners and poets say its sound resembles the sweetness of the Phoenix's call, the king of birds in Chinese belief.e.g. in a story attributed to Liu Xiang, the player Xiao Shi \\"could imitate the sound of the phoenix with his flute. He married a princess, and later, with her, transformed into two phoenixes and flew away,\\" from Liexian zhuan (Collected Life Stories of Immortals), in Dao zang (complete collection of Treasury of Daoist Writings), 138. Summarized in English in Paul Waldau and Kimberley Patton, eds., A Communion of Subjects: Animals in Religion, Science, and Ethics (NY: Columbia University Press, 2009), 289, note 42. , 9780231136433 In modern society, there has been an increase of cultural emphasis of the xiao flute in the Guizhou Providence. That is due to the presence of Yuping Flute Products there and its developing of \\"xiao flute culture\\".http://clausiuspress.com/conferences/AETP/ETMHS%202018/BCW511.pdf But the xiao flute is seen mostly in that case as a stepping stone for further developments of the Shaxiao flute. Organology Xiao are mostly made of bamboo, the best being 'black bamboo' or . Sometimes, the xiao is made of solid wood that has been carved and hollowed out. They can either be made plain, or have a horn inlay at the end and/or various inscriptions along the shaft. Usually, nylon wire bindings along the shaft are wrapped on which attempts to stabilize the bamboo and prevent cracking. Some players tie a tassel to dangle from one of the lower sound holes, purely for decorative purposes. Xiao are today most often pitched in the key of G (with the D above middle C being the lowest note, with all fingers covered), although xiao in other less common keys are also available, most commonly in the key of F. More traditional xiao have six finger holes, while most modern ones have eight; the additional holes do not extend the instrument's range but instead make it easier to play notes such as F natural. There are a further four (sometimes two or six) sound holes situated at the bottom third of the length of the xiao. The blowing hole is at the top end, it may be cut into a 'U' shape, a \\"V\\" shape, or at an angle (with or without bone/ivory inlay.) Some xiao have the blowing end entirely cut off, so the player must use the space between their chin and lips to cover the hole fully. There may be a metal joint between the blow hole and the top finger hole for tuning purposes and sometimes also between the last finger hole and the end. The length of the xiao ranges from around 45 cm to over 1.25 m but is usually around 75–85 cm. Usually, shorter xiaos are more difficult to play because of the need to control one's breath more accurately. The angle to play the xiao is around 45 degrees from the body. Varieties In addition to the standard dongxiao, there are other types of xiao which includes (but not limited to): The bei xiao' (), \\"Northern Xiao\\") is the common variant of Xiao in the North. It is characterized by its longer construction usually made of Purple Bamboo. The Bei Xiao's tone is less thick than the Nan Xiao, as it does not include the root of bamboo. Its mouthpiece is commonly in a U shape. The qin xiao () is a version of the beixiao, which is narrower and generally in the key of F with eight smaller finger holes, used to accompany the guqin. The narrowness of the qin xiao makes the tone softer, making it more suitable to play with the qin which is a very quiet instrument and a normal beixiao would drown out its low volume. The nanxiao (), \\"Southern Xiao\\"), sometimes called chiba (, \\"foot- eight\\", an old name still used for the Japanese shakuhachi) is a short xiao with open mouthpiece used in the Nanyin, the local Fujianese opera from Quanzhou. Typically, the end incorporates a part of the root of the bamboo. This variant of Xiao is used in the South of China and in Taiwan, usually made of Taiwanese bamboo. Related instruments A separate instrument, the paixiao () is a panpipe which was used in ancient China and which, although it remains unusual, has recently had something of a comeback. The Japanese shakuhachi and hocchiku, Vietnamese tiêu, and the Korean tungso and danso (also spelled tanso), are descended from earlier forms of the Chinese xiao.

It was originally a weekly trade newspaper, which covered all aspects of the electronics industry, including semiconductors, computers, software, communications, space and even television electronics. History and profile Fairchild Publications started the newspaper in 1957, as a complement to its other trade newspapers, including Women's Wear Daily, Home Furnishing Daily, Supermarket News, among others. At its peak in 1984, Electronic News took in $25 million in revenue with margins above 50%. The following year, the newspaper began losing advertising and influence to rival Electronic Engineering Times, beginning a decline that eventually led to the newspaper's demise. In 1971, journalist Don Hoefler published a series of articles entitled \\"Silicon Valley, USA\\" in Electronic News. This is thought to be the first published use of the phrase Silicon Valley to describe the area of the southern part of the San Francisco Bay area in northern California, United States, an area known for its concentration of companies making semiconductors, among them Intel, LSI Logic, and National Semiconductor. Also in 1971, Electronic News was where Intel first advertised the Intel 4004 microprocessor, considered to be the first single-chip microprocessor., citing personal email from Nick Tredennick A decade later, in 1981, when IBM's top- secret Project Acorn emerged as the IBM Personal Computer - the PC - the first reports were published in Electronic News in the weeks before the introduction, much to IBM's consternation. Also in 1982, Electronic News communications industry reporter Frank Barbetta broke the story on the Bell System Divestiture which resulted in the break-up of American Telephone & Telegraph Company, and published the first interview with Judge Harold H. Greene. The paper eventually grew to have a staff of three dozen full-time journalists, working out of headquarters staffed by full-time journalists in New York City and bureaus in Boston, Washington DC, Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Minneapolis and Tokyo. In addition, stringers reported in from more than 100 locations around the world. In 1987, the paper's corporate parent, Fairchild Publications was acquired by Capital Cities Broadcasting, which went on to acquire the American Broadcasting Company, now a unit of The Walt Disney Company. The publication was transferred from Fairchild to Chilton, then a division of Capital Cities/ABC, as the result of a reorganization. After barely a year as part of Chilton, the paper was sold in 1991 to the publishing house International Data Group. After a year of losses, IDG sold the paper in 1993 to an independent investor group put together by one-time publisher Zachary Dicker. In 1996 the paper was sold to Reed Business Information. Reed Business Information sold the magazine to Canon Communications in February 2010. In October 2010 Cannon Communications was acquired by United Business Media, now UBM LLC. The final edition of Electronic News to be printed on paper was dated December 2, 2002. It has since that date been published exclusively online. It was later merged into EDN.

Cutler was known for his songs, but also his dry, West Country humour, and gained the unofficial title of \\"The Bard Of Avonmouth\\". Early life Alan John Cutler was born in Portishead, Somerset. Nicknamed 'Adge' by his friends, from his initials A.J., he lived in the small North Somerset town of Nailsea. He spent his earlier years pursuing various jobs he would use as material for later songs, including road manager for Acker Bilk, working in a cider mill (Coates of Nailsea), and working on building a power station in North Wales. He spent a year in Spain working as an agent looking for property. During his time there he grew to love the country and the Spanish way of life, as well as becoming fluent in Spanish. On 2 September 1972, he married Yvonne, moving to Tickenham, a few miles north of Nailsea. The first biography of Adge Cutler, Adge: King of the Wurzels, by John Hudson, was published by Bristol Books in November 2012. Musical career Cutler's songs are largely sung in his own accent, though some are in an exaggerated Bristolian accent, and one in West Indian dialect. Cutler was influenced by Len \\"Uke\\" Thomas, a singer who left no recordings but who sang in the Bristolian dialect and who was a well known Bristol entertainer. Virtually all of Cutler's recordings are live; one album, Cutler of the West, was recorded at the Webbington Country Club, which is very easy to see on the M5 motorway, on the slopes of Crook Peak. Death On 5 May 1974, he died when he crashed his MGB sports car on a roundabout in Chepstow, following a Wurzels concert. Cutler is buried in the graveyard of Christ Church, Nailsea. A bronze statue of Cutler was installed outside the Royal Oak pub in Nailsea in October 2016. In June 2020, the statue was defaced by the addition of googly eyes, however, these were quickly removed. Football supporter Cutler was a fan of Bristol City F.C., his local side. Many incorrectly believe he wrote \\"Morning Glory\\", which was later re-written as the Bristol City song \\"One for the Bristol City\\", which is played when the teams enter the pitch on both halves of their home games at Ashton Gate. However, both songs were written after Adge's death. Some also believe Adge may have been a Rovers fan; however, this too is factually incorrect.Biography on Windows Media Songs Some of Cutler's best known songs include: \\"Pill Pill\\" – A song about Pill, Somerset, a village dear to Adge's heart \\"When the Common Market Comes to Stanton Drew\\" – Written in response to opening up of trade with Europe, Adge suggests what might happen to Somerset culture when Europeans come over. \\"Champion Dung Spreader\\" – An answer song to \\"My Old Man's a Dustman\\", where Adge tells of his father's occupation as a champion dung spreader. \\"Thee's Gott'n where thee cassn't back'n hassn't\\" – A song about a young couple getting into all sorts of jams in their new car around Bristol (except for one verse, which happens in Paris), very double-entendre- ish. Much of it is sung in Bristolian. The title is 'translated' as \\"You've got it where you can't reverse it, haven't you?\\". \\"The Charlton Mackrell Jugband\\" – About a village band and their rise to the top of the charts. The fictitious band members are Amos Draper, Bernard Mace, Arnold Slugg and the singers (we assume to be Adge). The name of Charlton Mackrell is not used in the lyrics, so other bands have adapted it; including \\"the Piddletrenthide Jugband\\". \\"Drink Up Thy Zyder\\" – Regarded as the National anthem of North Somerset and Bristol, if not all of Somerset. By far the most famous Adge Cutler song, often played on local radio. Also the 'theme tune' of Bristol City F.C. \\"Don't tell I Tell 'ee\\" – A song about not wanting to be burdened with others troubles. \\"Twice Daily\\" – Perhaps one of Adge's best known and loved songs, it was released as a B-Side on the band's first single \\"Drink up thy Zyder\\" in 1967. Deemed too raunchy and banned by the BBC, it tells the story of a farm labourer who begins a physical relationship with a female fellow worker called 'Lucy Bailey'. (\\"She ups 'n slips, zummat rips, I went there Twice Daily!\\"). This results in her pregnancy and a subsequent shotgun wedding arranged by her father. All ends happily, however, since they spend 40 years together and produce a further 9 children, with no apparent slowdown in the physical side of the relationship either. (\\"Tho' I'm old and grey when I gets me way, I still go there Twice Daily..\\").

Definition Let (X, T) be a topological space and let Σ be a σ-algebra on X. Let μ be a measure on (X, Σ). A measurable subset A of X is said to be inner regular if :\\\\mu (A) = \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mu (F) \\\\mid F \\\\subseteq A, F \\\\text{ compact and measurable} \\\\\\\\} and said to be outer regular if :\\\\mu (A) = \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mu (G) \\\\mid G \\\\supseteq A, G \\\\text{ open and measurable} \\\\\\\\} *A measure is called inner regular if every measurable set is inner regular. Some authors use a different definition: a measure is called inner regular if every open measurable set is inner regular. *A measure is called outer regular if every measurable set is outer regular. *A measure is called regular if it is outer regular and inner regular. Examples =Regular measures= * Lebesgue measure on the real line is a regular measure: see the regularity theorem for Lebesgue measure. * Any Baire probability measure on any locally compact σ-compact Hausdorff space is a regular measure. *Any Borel probability measure on a locally compact Hausdorff space with a countable base for its topology, or compact metric space, or Radon space, is regular. =Inner regular measures that are not outer regular= * An example of a measure on the real line with its usual topology that is not outer regular is the measure μ where \\\\mu(\\\\emptyset) = 0, \\\\mu\\\\left( \\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}\\\\right) = 0\\\\,\\\\,, and \\\\mu(A) = \\\\infty\\\\,\\\\, for any other set A. *The Borel measure on the plane that assigns to any Borel set the sum of the (1-dimensional) measures of its horizontal sections is inner regular but not outer regular, as every non-empty open set has infinite measure. A variation of this example is a disjoint union of an uncountable number of copies of the real line with Lebesgue measure. *An example of a Borel measure μ on a locally compact Hausdorff space that is inner regular, σ-finite, and locally finite but not outer regular is given by as follows. The topological space X has as underlying set the subset of the real plane given by the y-axis of points (0,y) together with the points (1/n,m/n2) with m,n positive integers. The topology is given as follows. The single points (1/n,m/n2) are all open sets. A base of neighborhoods of the point (0,y) is given by wedges consisting of all points in X of the form (u,v) with v − y ≤ u ≤ 1/n for a positive integer n. This space X is locally compact. The measure μ is given by letting the y-axis have measure 0 and letting the point (1/n,m/n2) have measure 1/n3. This measure is inner regular and locally finite, but is not outer regular as any open set containing the y-axis has measure infinity. =Outer regular measures that are not inner regular= *If μ is the inner regular measure in the previous example, and M is the measure given by M(S) = infU⊇S μ(U) where the inf is taken over all open sets containing the Borel set S, then M is an outer regular locally finite Borel measure on a locally compact Hausdorff space that is not inner regular in the strong sense, though all open sets are inner regular so it is inner regular in the weak sense. The measures M and μ coincide on all open sets, all compact sets, and all sets on which M has finite measure. The y-axis has infinite M-measure though all compact subsets of it have measure 0. *A measurable cardinal with the discrete topology has a Borel probability measure such that every compact subset has measure 0, so this measure is outer regular but not inner regular. The existence of measurable cardinals cannot be proved in ZF set theory but (as of 2013) is thought to be consistent with it. =Measures that are neither inner nor outer regular= *The space of all ordinals at most equal to the first uncountable ordinal Ω, with the topology generated by open intervals, is a compact Hausdorff space. The measure that assigns measure 1 to Borel sets containing an unbounded closed subset of the countable ordinals and assigns 0 to other Borel sets is a Borel probability measure that is neither inner regular nor outer regular.

A windsurfing harness is part of the trapeze used in the sports of windsurfing and kitesurfing to connect the rider to the rig by a line attached to the boom or kitesurfing bar. It consists of a girdle-like contraption that is worn around the body, with a hook for attachment.Harness Suitable for Use on Watercraft Hooking-in the harness is done by pulling the sail toward the body and hooking into the harness lines on the boom. The harness turns windsurfing into a long lasting activity, taking the weight of the sail off the arms of the windsurfer. Types of harnesses There are four basic types of harnesses: *The waist harness: Worn around the waist and lower back, providing back support. *Crossover Harness (e.g. Dakine XT) Fits around the backside but has padding and support for the back as well. *The seat (or slalom) harness: Fits around the backside, with straps that pass between the legs. *The chest harness: Fits over the chest like a vest, providing buoyancy and padding for protection. History and development The first truly functional harness was developed by Pat Love and Ken Kleid of Windsurfing Hawaii in Kailua, Hawaii in about 1974. It consisted of a vest-like nylon jacket to which a hook was attached. The sailor used the hook to attach to lines attached to each of the wishbone booms.Windsurfing harness lines When future world champion Robby Naish began using a harness in Kailua in 1975 when he was twelve years old, he had problems with his chest being painfully squeezed by the force on the hook. Mike Horgan and Larry Stanley developed a spreader bar to balance the load and prevent the harness from squeezing the wearer's chest. The spreader bar is now in almost universal use. The seat harness was developed on Maui when young Ian Boyd experienced the same problems mentioned above as Robbie Naish. The solution, half in jest, was to wear a chest harness upside-down with the hook inverted. Barry Holopeter was an R&D; expert for Da Kine, and developed the first working model. This design proved to be very efficient in speed sailing and was used by Fred Haywood in his world speed-record runs. Many companies have developed the harness over the years with major innovations coming from DaKine and Windsurfing Hawaii.

Homes and farms in the village are influenced by the style of the Middle Ages apart from Church Lodge. History Early mention of Southwick Southwick was initially the site of Southwick Priory, in the 12th century. On the Dissolution of the Monasteries during the Reformation the estate, including the village, was granted to John White. Southwick House, a new manor house was completed in 1813. This house was gutted by fire in 1838, and was renovated and rebuilt by 1841. The house and part of the estate was requisitioned by the government during World War II, when the house was Eisenhower's SHAEF headquarters for Overlord, the cross-channel invasion of Normandy. The house has been used by various branches of the armed forces, including as HMS Dryad, ever since. Southwick is rare in that the village is still entirely owned by the Southwick Estate (except for Church Lodge). The most obvious sign of this is that all the houses, except manor houses, have dark red-painted front doors - a condition laid down in the tenancy agreements. The only exceptions to this are the White House, the residence of the vicar and Church Lodge. Church Lodge is the only privately owned house in the old village and is shown in the fourth picture below. The church itself is Grade I listed early medieval, known as St James, but officially \\"St James without (i.e. outside) the priory gate\\". The Defence School of Policing and Guarding is situated at nearby Southwick Park. As of 16 October 2011 the FirstGroup bus services providing travel to the village residents has been withdrawn. The only shop within the village is located opposite the church and is known as Southwick Village Stores.

Tosdal Professor of Music at St. Olaf College of Northfield, Minnesota in the United States. Armstrong became the fourth director of the St. Olaf Choir in 1990, continuing the tradition begun by the choir's founder F. Melius Christiansen in 1911, sustained and developed by his son, Olaf Christiansen, and strengthened and enhanced by Kenneth Jennings. Armstrong also teaches conducting in the Sacred Music department at Luther Seminary. He also conducts some pieces in \\"Northfield Youth Choirs\\". Early life Anton was born in New York City on April 26, 1956 to William Benfield Armstrong (1916–2002) and Esther Louise Holder (1917–2007). William was born in Antigua, and Esther was born in New York City to Herbert Henry Holder (1887–1973) and Leander Hassell (1890–1945), both from St Thomas. Armstrong grew up on Long Island where he and his mother were active singers in a local church choir. Armstrong joined the American Boychoir, based in Princeton, New Jersey. According to Armstrong, \\"That experience lit my fire for choral singing.\\" Anton Armstrong was first made aware of the St. Olaf Choir when his pastor took him to a performance at Avery Fisher Hall despite the fact that Armstrong had tickets to see the Moody Blues at Madison Square Garden. His mother made the decision for him to attend the St. Olaf Choir concert. Anton is the youngest of three brothers. Oldest brother Garry was (until 2001) a reporter for WHDH-TV, Channel 7 in Boston, Massachusetts, and next older brother William (Billy) is a printing professional on Long Island, New York. Armstrong earned his bachelor's degree at St. Olaf College, graduating in 1978. He was a member of the St. Olaf Choir from 1976–1978, under the leadership of Kenneth Jennings. Jennings became a mentor to Armstrong and 12 years after graduating from St. Olaf, Armstrong replaced Jennings as director of the St. Olaf Choir. After graduating from St. Olaf, Armstrong attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign where he earned a Masters of Music degree and Michigan State University where he completed a Doctorate of Musical Arts. His doctoral thesis was Celebrating 75 Years of Musical Excellence: the Evolution of the St. Olaf Choir. Career Upon completion of his masters, Armstrong worked for 10 years at Calvin College and conducted the Capella of Calvin, the Campus Choir, the Grand Rapids Symphony Chorus and the Calvin Alumni Choir. He completed his doctorate during his years at Calvin College. He also conducted the St. Cecilia Youth Chorale from 1981 until his departure for St. Olaf in 1990.

He is director of the St. Olaf Choir and Collegiate Chorale and also teaches advanced choral conducting and vocal pedagogy classes that focus on child and adolescent voice. He serves as the artistic director of the St. Olaf Christmas Festival. Armstrong is currently the summer music director of the Youth Choral Academy of the Oregon Bach Festival. The 12-day choral festival is based in Eugene, Oregon. He is an editor for Earthsongs Publications and co-editor of Augsburg Fortress Publishers.

It is the fourth-tallest statue in the United States after Birth of the New World, The Statue of Liberty, and the Pegasus and Dragon. The base is 8,510 feet above sea level and 3,500 feet above the town. The statue sits on private land and is lit and visible at night. The statue was originally conceived by Butte resident Bob O'Bill in 1979 as a tribute to the Virgin Mary following the recovery of his wife from cancer. Later, the statue was additionally dedicated to \\"all women, especially mothers.\\" Construction The statue was first imagined by Bob O'Bill in 1979 during a time when his wife was seriously ill with cancer. O'Bill said he promised the Virgin Mary that if his wife recovered, he would make a 5-foot statue of Mary to place outdoors, possibly in a city park. When his wife recovered, he began the project with some friends, who gradually changed the initial vision to a 90-foot mountaintop statue. The statue was largely constructed using donations of money, materials, and labor from the local community. The design was engineered by Laurien Eugene Riehl, a retired engineer for the Anaconda Copper Mining Company who donated his skills to the project. Work on the project began December 29, 1979. The base of the statue was poured in September 1985 with 400 tons of concrete. On December 17, 1985, a CH-54 Tarhe from the Army National Guard's 137th Aviation Company airlifted the statue in four sections to its present location at Saddle Rock atop Butte's East Ridge. The land for the site was donated by Guy Ossello. Tourism The Our Lady of the Rockies gift shop in Butte offers bus tours to the statue during summer. Controversy = Opposition = Prior to the statue being erected, some residents voiced opposition to the project on religious grounds. In 1981, evoking the doctrine of separation of church and state, Catholic priest Father Edward Hislop was quoted in The Montana Standard as saying, \\"Although the statue is on private ground, it is clearly in a public place. The East Ridge has always belonged to the people of Butte, and that might be offensive to some and pose difficulties.\\" In March 1985, nationally syndicated advice columnist Ann Landers published a letter from a reader complaining that \\"one religious group in Butte, Mont., is forcing its religious beliefs on an entire city.\\" = Job Corps involvement = In August 1994, the Freedom From Religion Foundation received notice from one of its members that the nearby Anaconda Job Corps was involved in building a chapel at the statue site in Butte. Objecting to the use of federal resources in the construction of a place of worship, the foundation filed a letter of complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor, which on September 11 ceased the Job Corps' involvement. = Tram to the site = In July 2005, a group of homeowners sued Our Lady of the Rockies over plans to use a road near their homes to build a tram to the statue. The plans were approved by Butte district court, but on appeal, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in April 2008 that the road is in fact private and cannot be used for the tram. Plans for the tram remain unrealized.

She specializes in cyclo-cross racing and is a 15-time national champion.http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/usa-cycling-cyclo-cross-national- championships-2018/elite-women/results/ Compton formerly piloted a tandem with a blind partner in Paralympic events. She has won the USA Cycling Cyclocross National Championships Elite Women's title in an unbroken 15- win streak every season from 2004 to 2018. Since she took part in Paralympic events she can not enter any bicycle races which award UCI points. Since she was unable to take part in major races before the National Championship, her win was a surprise to other racers, fans and journalists, ending her Paralympic career under UCI regulations. Katie Compton In 2007, she became the first American woman to podium in the Cyclo-cross World Championships (held in the Cyclo-cross capital of the world that year—Belgium) where she won silver between a French duo composed of Maryline Salvetat (who took the gold) and Laurence Leboucher (who won the bronze). In the 2007–2008 season she began racing professionally in UCI races as she no longer had her Paralympic obligations. In the beginning of the season she routinely has won the elite women's races in the US and on November 11, in only her third ever, she won her first World Cup Race in Pijnacker, Netherlands. Compton won by a margin of 54 seconds ahead of race favorite Daphny van den Brand who had won the previous World Cup race in Kalmthout. In Paralympic events she rides a tandem with a blind partner Karissa Whitsell. Compton, the sighted team member, pilots and pedals the tandem in the captain position while Whitsell rides in the rear, stoker, position on their tandem. They were dominant in the 2004 Games, winning medals in every event they entered and setting a world record in the 3 km pursuit event. Compton has amassed twenty three World Cup wins and four medals at the Cyclocross World Championships, and 130+ UCI wins, making Compton the most successful US Cyclocross athlete male or female in the sport. In 2012, Compton signed a contract with the Trek Cyclocross Collective. Compton has worked closely with Trek testing and developing geometry she designed for the successful Trek Crockett and Boone cyclocross models. In 2014 Compton rides for the Trek Factory Racing Team. In 2014 Compton won her 100th UCI race after winning the Valkenburg World Cup in The Netherlands. In 2016 Trek removed Compton off Trek Factory Racing support. Compton went on to form her own team, \\"KFC Racing\\" with sponsors including Trek Bikes,Knight Composites and Panache Clothing. Compton resumed her winning ways for the 2016-17 cyclocross season winning her first race at the Trek CXC Cup in Waterloo, Wisconsin. In 2018 Compton became the first non-European to win the DVV Trofee overall. In 2018 Compton won the silver medal at the World Championships in Valkenburg, NL in a thrilling battle with Sanne Cant.

The station's main transmitter is located at Mount Bélair. Its studios are co-located with its francophone sister stations on Rue St-Jean in Downtown Quebec City. CBVE is the originating station for all CBC Radio One transmitters in Quebec outside Montreal and the Outaouais. Together, they are known as the Quebec Community Network, with a special mandate to provide service to the province's anglophone minority. Although it is a semi-satellite of CBME-FM in Montreal, most of the station's operations are in Quebec City except for master control, which is based at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto. History The station was launched in 1976. Prior to its launch, CBC Radio programming was aired on private affiliate CFOM. Following CFOM's shutdown as a commercial station in late 1975, the CBC directly acquired the station and kept it in operation until the FM signal was launched. The station was originally a rebroadcaster of CBM in Montreal (now CBME-FM). In 1994, however, it was granted a separate license. At the same time, all but one of CBM's rebroadcasters were transferred to CBVE.Decision CRTC 94-612, New radio programming undertaking consisting of CBVE-FM and its transmitters, CRTC, August 15, 1994 The call sign CBME was formerly used for a low-power AM repeater in La Tuque which changed to CBVE-1. Local programming CBVE-FM's local programs are Quebec AM, hosted by Susan Campbell, in the mornings and Breakaway, hosted by Jacquie Czernin, in the afternoons.

Maruyama Okyo was well known for his true-to-life paintings. The story, illustrated by this print, tells of the time Okyo painted a ghost so \\"realistically\\" that it came to life and frightened him. Crows, 1766; pair of sixfold screens; ink and gold on paper. Cracked Ice shows influence from Western art in its use of perspective. , born Maruyama Masataka, was a Japanese artist active in the late 18th century. He moved to Kyoto, during which he studied artworks from Chinese, Japanese and Western sources. A personal style of Western naturalism mixed with Eastern decorative design emerged, and Ōkyo founded the Maruyama school of painting. Although many of his fellow artists criticized his work as too slavishly devoted to natural representation, it proved a success with laymen. Early career Ōkyo was born into a farming family in Ano-o, in present-day Kameoka, Kyoto. As a teenager, he moved to Kyoto and joined the townspeople (chōnin) class. He apprenticed for a toy shop, where he painted the faces onto dolls. The shop began selling European stereoscopes, novelties that when looked into presented the illusion of a three-dimensional image. It was Ōkyo's first look at Western-style perspective,Sullivan 16. and in 1767 he tried his hand at one of the images. He created Harbour View, a small picture in single-point perspective. Ōkyo soon mastered the techniques of drawing stereoscope images (', eyeglass pictures). Ōkyo decided to pursue a career as an artist. He first studied under Ishida Yūtei, a member of the Kanō school and ultimately a bigger influence on Ōkyo than the stereoscope images.Mason 319. During these formative years, Ōkyo studied Chinese painting as well. He particularly admired the works of Qian Xuan, a 13th-century painter known for his detailed flower drawings, and Qiu Ying, a 16th-century figure painter.Paine 226. In fact, the \\"kyo\\" in Ōkyo's name was adopted in tribute to Ch'ien Hsüan. Ōkyo even briefly adopted the Chinese practice of signing his name with one character, so for a time he was known as Ōkyo En. He studied the works of Shen Quan, a Chinese artist who lived in Nagasaki from 1731 to 1733 and painted images of flowers. However, Ōkyo did not like the artist's treatment of proportion, preferring the works of Watanabe Shikō.Paine 225–226. He also studied Ming and Qing paintings.Noma 150. Perhaps most significantly, Ōkyo eagerly studied any Western paintings or prints he could find. Success Ōkyo's first major commission came in 1768 from Yūjō, abbot of a temple in Ōtsu called Enman'in. Over the next three years, Ōkyo painted The Seven Misfortunes and Seven Fortunes, a depiction of the results of both bad and good karma. The three scrolls total about 148 ft (45 m) in length. Ōkyo tried to find models for the people depicted in them, even for the shocking images such as a man being ripped in two by frightened bulls.Mason 320. His introduction to the work states that he believed that people needed to see reality, not imaginary images of Nirvana or Hell, if they were to truly believe in Buddhist principles.Mason 319–320. Pine Trees, c. 1780; pair of sixfold screens. Other painters were critical of Ōkyo's style. They found it to be overly concerned with physical appearances, alleging that he was too beholden to the real world and produced undignified works. Nevertheless, his style proved popular with the public, and commissions came in to do Western- style landscapes, decorative screens, and nudes. He did life drawings and used them for material in his paintings.Sadao 223. Ōkyo was probably the first Japanese artist to do life drawings from nude models. The subject was still considered pornographic in Japan. During his career he painted for wealthy merchants, the shogunate, even the emperor.Paine 228. The public's perception of Ōkyo's skill is evident in a legend recounted by Van Briessen. The story goes that a daimyō commissioned Ōkyo to paint a \\"ghost image\\" of a lost family member. Once the work was completed, the ghost image came off the painting and flew away.Van Briessen 27. Maruyama school Success prompted Ōkyo to start a school in Kyoto, where he could teach his new style. He was a talented art teacher, and he soon took on many students. He taught them to rely on nature to render images in a realistic picture of light, shadow, and forms. The school grew popular, and branches soon appeared in other locations, including Osaka. Much of the school's work is today preserved at Daijō-ji, a temple in Kasumi (Hyōgo Prefecture). Noteworthy pupils include Ōkyo's son, Maruyama Ōzui, Nagasawa Rosetsu, and Matsumura Goshun. Goshun joined Ōkyo's school in 1787. That year, the Maruyama school took a commission to paint screens for Daijō-ji. Later that year, Kyoto suffered a devastating fire, so Ōkyo and Goshun moved into a temple called Kiunin. The two became fast friends, and Ōkyo refused to regard their relationship as that of a teacher and student.Mason 322. Goshun later went on to found the Shijō school.antonia williams Style Peacock and Peahen; hanging scroll; color on silk Ōkyo's painting style merged a tranquil version of Western naturalism with the Eastern decorative painting of the Kanō school.Sadao 214. His works show a Western understanding of highlight and shadow. His realism differed from previous Japanese schools in its devotion to nature as the ultimate source with no regard for sentiment. Ōkyo's intricately detailed plant and animal sketches show a great influence from European nature drawings. An album of leaves in the Nishimura Collection in Kyoto (now in handscroll form) depicts several animals and plants, each labeled as if in European guidebook.Sullivan 16, 18. Still, Ōkyo's works remain Japanese. Unlike European painting, Ōkyo's images have very few midtones. Moreover, he follows the Eastern tradition in depicting objects with very little setting; often his pictures feature a single subject on a plain background. The result is a more immediate naturalism with a decorative and reflective feel. This was achieved through skillful brush handling; Ōkyo painted with a broad, flat brush, which he would load with more paint on one side. This created broad strokes that vary in paint coverage.Paine 225. Nature was not his only subject; many works by Ōkyo depict normal scenes from life in Kyoto's commercial area. Dragon His Geese Alighting on Water, painted at Enman'in, Ōtsu in 1767, is an early example of his mature style. The subject is treated as a part of nature; nothing philosophical is implied as had been done with such imagery in the East Asian tradition. Likewise, Kingfisher and Trout, painted in 1769, features a bird near the top of the image, waiting for a fish. The trout swims under a large rock near the center. Bird, fish, and stone all appear as they do in nature, creating a matter-of-fact, comprehensible, and natural-looking piece. Later in his oeuvre, Pine Trees in Snow, executed in 1773 for the wealthy Mitsui family, is realistic despite being in the Japanese idiom of ink on a gold background. The two six-panel screens show tree bark and pine needles separated by differing brush strokes, and the white snow seems to weigh down the branches.Paine 227. The bark is painted in the tsuketate technique, which uses no outlines, just dark and light shades to create the illusion of volume. Hozu Rapids, painted in 1795, is one of Ōkyo's later works. On two eightfold screens it depicts a tree and a cluster of rocks with some dragons. The work thus shows Ōkyo's ability to render the natural elements in a convincingly realistic fashion. However, the dragons, according to art critics such as Paine, demonstrate a weakness; they are treated academically, thus losing their grand, legendary essence.Paine 227–228.

in the state of West Bengal, India. It is the headquarters of the Bankura district. Etymology In the Mahabharata, Bankura was described as Suhmobhumi. The word or (in Nagari: rāḍh) was introduced after 6th century A.D. It comes from the old Austric word ráŕhá or ráŕho which means “land of red soil”.P.R. Sarkar Rarh - The Cradle of Civilization, Ananda Marga Publications, 1981, Kolkata 2-n ancient times \\"China called Ráŕh by the name of 'Láti'\\". 3-n Santali, means thread, means tune and means snake. 4-.Perhaps the Jain and Greek scholars used this original Austric word to indicate this dry forest region which was very difficult. The popularity of Manasa Puja, the worship of Snake-Goddess Manasa, shows this opinion might have some relevance. According to Nilkantha, a commentator of the Mahabharata, the words (Sanskrit: suhma-bhūmi) and Rarh are synonymous. Scholars differs in their opinion about the etymology of the name Bankura. In the words of the Kol-Mundas, orah or rah means habitation. Many places of Rarh have an added rah at the end of their names. One of the most influential gods of the district 6-Dharmathakur is called Bankura Roy. The name of the district may come from his name. Linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterjee thinks that the name came from the word banka (zig-zag), and its word- corruption banku, which means extremely beautiful, and he who must be worshiped. In 1979, the word “Bancoorah” was found in the map of Renal. In 1863, Gastrel referred this region as Bancoonda. Bir Hambir was the 49th king of Bagdi Malla dynasty. Bir Bankura was one of his two sons. Raja Bir Hambir divided his kingdom into 22 tarafs or circles and gave one to his each son. Taraf Jaybelia fell to the lot of Bir Bankura. He developed a town in his taraf and the town was later named as 'Bankura' after its founder's name.

Early life The son of a Holocaust survivor, Fisher was born in Petah Tikva, Israel. Fisher had a son in June 2016. His wife Revital is his promoter and his agent. Cantorial career Fisher began cantorial studies at age 22, after his discharge from the army following three years of service that included the Yom Kippur War. He studied at the Tel Aviv Academy of Music, and studied privately under Cantor Shlomo Ravitz. He then took up the cantorial position at the Great Synagogue in Tel Aviv, followed by four years in South Africa. For over 20 years, he was the cantor at Kutsher's Hotel in the Catskills during the Jewish high holidays. In 2005, he became the Chief Cantor of the Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton Beach, New York and its now defunct subsidiary, the New York Synagogue in Manhattan.A Short Second Life for a Building With History. New York Times archive, retrieved March 10, 2016. Les Misérables After being mesmerised by the London performance of the 1980s hit musical, Fisher, despite no prior acting experience, requested the part in a Hebrew production of Les Misérables. He played its leading role, Jean Valjean, in Israel from 1987-90. In 1988 he was invited to perform the role before Queen Elizabeth II. He played the role on New York City's Broadway during the winter of 1993-1994, and later at London's West End. At both venues, Fisher was the first performer excused from Friday night and Saturday performances, as he is an Orthodox Jew and was not able to perform because of the Sabbath.  Other performance roles  Among Fisher's other performances is his one-man Off-Broadway show, Never on Friday, an anecdotal work exploring the complications of his experience on Broadway as an observant Jew. He performed in many tours around Israel, the United States, and the world, particularly in Jewish communities, performing classics, as well as musicals, such as Over the Rainbow which toured Israel with Fisher performing 40 Broadway show tunes. He performed with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Zubin Mehta, with a performance televised in France, and with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and the Queens Symphony Orchestra. He has recorded an album of show tunes with the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the first Israeli artist allowed to sing in the Soviet Union before perestroika. In May 2009, Fisher sang along with contratenor David D'Or for Pope Benedict XVI as the pope visited Israel. In 1988, he was invited to London to take part in a Royal Command Performance hosted by the Queen of England. The performance was a special version of Les Misérables, featuring artists from the many productions playing around the world. From there, the play’s producer, Cameron Mackintosh, invited Fisher to play the role of Jean Valjean on Broadway and London's West End.  Discography  In addition to his stage and synagogue performance, Fisher has released over 25 albums, including songs in Hebrew, Yiddish, and English, many classics and cantorial pieces, as well as music for children. He also dubbed the part of Moses in the Hebrew version of Steven Spielberg's animated film, The Prince of Egypt (1998). * Beshem Hashem (In God's Name) (2008) * Hatikvah (2005) * Lehitei Yiddish Beivrit (Yiddish hits in Hebrew) (2005) * Coming to America (2004) * Prayers On Broadway (2003) * Odecha (1999) * Mamenyu (1997) * L'tav Ulchayim V'lishlam (For Good, for Life and for Peace) (1997) * Never on Friday (1996) * Az Yashir David (1996) * Showstoppers (1994) * The Malavsky Family Songs (1993) * Mamma Loshon (Mother Tongue) (1992) * Velvet Tiger (1992) * Golden Chasidic Song (1992) * Gift (1992) * Tonight, a Musical (1991) * Stairways to Heaven (1990) * Over the Rainbow (1989) * Yiddishkeit (1988) * Elokai Neshama (1985) * Songs of My Heart (1983) * Golden Yiddish Favorites (1985) * Childhood Years * Raisins and Almonds * Songs of the Living * Yiddishe Mamme * Dudu Fisher's Kindergarten (DVD/VHS): *# (1998) (translated to English) *# \\"We Are All Friends\\" (2000) *# \\"From the Heart and Soul\\" (2001) *# \\"The Friendship Trip\\" (2002) (translated to English) *# \\"It's the Thought That Counts\\" (2003) *# \\"From the Mouth of the Infants\\" *# \\"Shabat Shalom\\" *# \\"Shana Tova\\" *# \\"And Thou Rejoice in Thy Feast\\" *# \\"From Slavery to Freedom\\" *# \\"A Great Miracle Happened There\\" *# \\"Shavuot Holyday\\" *# \\"Jerusalem\\" (translated to English) *# \\"Purim\\" *# \\"Song of the Animals\\" He also joined David D'Or, Eran Zur, and Meir Banai in the song \\"Lisa\\" on the album Radio Blah-Blah (1994) by the Israeli band \\"The Friends of Natasha\\".

Ecology The lakes form part of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The closest town is Manguzi, some away from it. Kosi Bay estuary is only from the Mozambique border. It is possible to walk from the estuary to Ponta do Ouro in only an hour or so. It is one of the quietest beaches in South Africa. The Kosi River Mouth is known as \\"the aquarium\\" because of the clarity of the water and the abundance of fish species. Bird species in the area include the palm-nut vulture, Pel's fishing owl, white-backed night-heron, and kingfishers. Duiker, hippopotamus, crocodiles and bull sharks are also present, and loggerhead and endangered leatherback sea turtles lay their eggs on the beach. The Bay is noted for its aggressive bull shark population. The sharks are locally known as zambesi. Whales, whale sharks, dolphins are sighted off the coast.Most shark-infested beaches Couriermail Whale sharks and manta rays also visit the area. Whale watching to target mainly humpback whales and dolphins is a growing industry in Kosi Bay region. The Kosi palm has the largest leaf of any plant. Endemic species include the Kosi cycad and Kosi fern. It is one of very few places on earth where five different species of mangrove trees are found in one area. Kosi Bay is particularly famous for the traditional Tsonga fish traps built to trap fish moving in and out of the estuary with the tide. The Tsonga people, who have made this land their home for more than 1000 years, are experts in fish traps and the construction of fishkraal.Junod, HA 1913, The Life of a South African Tribe: The Psychic Life, Imprimerie Attinger Freres, Neuchatel. History Kosi Bay is the cultural capital of the ancient Tsonga Tembe kingdom. This is the original and natural home of the Tsonga people and their fish traps. The history of Vatsonga people on this land dates back some 1000 years.Mathebula, Mandla (2002), 800 Years of Tsonga History: 1200-2000, Burgersfort: Sasavona Publishers and Booksellers Pty Ltd. Kosi Bay and Maputo Bay can be considered one land-area, traditionally belonging to the Africans. Kosi Bay was also known as Tembeland or Thongaland, but the name fell into disuse in early 1900s. When Britain colonised South Africa, Kosi Bay was annexed to Natal, while Maputo was annexed to Mozambique. The Vatsonga people lost large tracts of land on St Lucia Bay in 1895 when Britain took the land and restricted the Tsonga people to Kosi Bay only. Before 1895, the Tsonga people controlled the whole of St Lucia Bay, known today as Greater St Lucia Wetland Park. Today, Kosi Bay continues to be the proud home of the Tsonga people. The Tembe Traditional Authority (led by Chief Israel Tembe, a descendant of the ancient Tembe kingdom) exercises political control over the area. The Tembe Elephant Park testifies to this ancient Tsonga history.

One of the most common stereotypies in horses is equine oral stereotypic behaviour, otherwise known as cribbing, wind sucking or crib-biting. Cribbing or crib biting involves a horse grasping a solid object such as the stall door or fence rail with its incisor teeth, then arching its neck, and contracting the lower neck muscles to retract the larynx. This coincides with an in-rush of air into the oesophagus producing the characteristic cribbing grunt. Usually, air is not swallowed but returns to the pharynx. Wind-sucking is a related behavior whereby the horse arches its neck and sucks air into the windpipe but does so without grasping an object. Wind-sucking is thought to form part of the mechanism of cribbing, rather than being defined as an entirely separate behavior. Cribbing is considered to be an abnormal, compulsive behavior or stereotypy seen in some horses, and is often labelled a stable vice. The major factors that cause cribbing include stress, stable management, genetic and gastrointestinal irritability. Cribbing was mentioned in the literature as early as 1578 and occurs in 2.4-8.3% of horses depending on breed and management. A similar but unrelated behavior, wood-chewing or lignophagia, is another undesirable habit observed in horses, but it does not involve sucking in air; the horse simply gnaws on wood rails or boards as if they were food. Description Cribbing, or crib biting, involves a horse grasping a solid object such as the stall door or fence rail with its incisor teeth, arching its neck, and contracting the lower neck muscles to retract the larynx caudally. This movement is coincided with an in-rush of air through the crico- pharynx into the oesophagus producing the characteristic cribbing sound or grunt. Usually, air is not swallowed but returns to the pharynx. It is considered to be an abnormal, compulsive behavior or stereotypy, and often labelled as a stable vice. Wind-sucking is a related behavior whereby the horse arches its neck and sucks air into the windpipe but does so without grasping an object. Wind-sucking is thought to form part of the mechanism of cribbing, rather than being defined as an entirely separate behavior. =Wood- chewing= A similar, but unrelated behavior, wood-chewing (lignophagia), is another undesirable behavior sometimes observed in horses. The horse gnaws on wood rails or boards as if they were food, but it does not involve sucking in air. Prevalence and incidence It is reported that 2.4–8.3% of horses in Europe and Canada are cribbers and occupies 15-65% of an individual horse's daily time budget. A postal survey in 2009 found that an average of 4.4% horses in the US are cribbers, but 13.3% of Thoroughbreds perform the behavior. Young Thoroughbred and part-Thoroughbred horses fed concentrated food after weaning are four times more likely to become cribbers than foals not fed concentrate. In several studies, Thoroughbreds consistently have the greatest prevalence of cribbing compared to other breeds. It was found that 11.03% of racehorses performed one or more abnormal stereotypical behaviour that lead back to animal welfare and husbandry systems. Wind-sucking occurs in 3.8% of non-racing horses in the US. One study shows that stereotypes in general, including cribbing, are more prevalent in dressage horses compared to several other uses. Geldings and stallions are more likely to exhibit cribbing than mares and the behavior has been reported as occurring in horses on pasture. Health effects There is evidence that stomach ulcers may lead to a horse becoming a cribber, and that cribbing may be a coping mechanism in response to stress. A 1998 study found that cribbing increased endorphins and found no evidence that cribbing generally impairs the health of affected horses, but later studies reported that cribbing and wind-sucking were related to a history of colic or the subsequent development of colic. A study found that horses would perform the cribbing behaviour in attempt to decrease the cortisol levels that can be brought on by stressful situations. According to this study, the long-term release of stress hormones can be harmful and can cause cardiovascular diseases, depression and immunosuppression. Causes Boredom, stress, habit and addiction are all possible causes of cribbing and wind-sucking. It was proposed in a 2002 study that the link between intestinal conditions such as gastric inflammation or colic and abnormal oral behavior was attributable to environmental factors. There is evidence that stomach ulcers may be correlated to a horse becoming a cribber. Stress is induced when environmental demands produce a physiological response, if that response has a long duration period, it exceeds the normal, natural regulatory ability of the organism. Stress has been found to be a major contributing factor to horses developing this oral stereotypic behaviour. A study suggested that the animal uses cribbing as a coping method when it cannot escape a fearful or stressful situation, or when it has been socially isolated or confined. Researchers now generally agree that cribbing and wind-sucking occur most often in stabled horses, although once established in an individual horse, the horse may exhibit these behaviors in other places. Recent studies indicate cribbing occurs more frequently in horses that were stable-weaned as foals than in those that were pasture-weaned. In the same study, feeding concentrates after weaning was associated with a fourfold increase in the rate of development of cribbing. The most popular cases of crib-biting come from racetracks, and it is believed to have derived from husbandry systems at the racetracks. The issue with these systems is that the social tendencies of the herd animal have been disrupted. Therefore, they are lacking social interaction and stimulation. Because Thoroughbreds are so consistently the most prevalent cribbers, this suggests there may be a genetic component, however, this may be confounded by different uses and management of different horse breeds. It was found that Thoroughbreds are three times more likely to develop this stereotypy than any other breed, supporting that this may be a genetic component. Another study suggesting that cribbing may be genetic found that Warmbloods were also more likely to perform this behaviour when compared to other breeds. It was also found that the descendants of a crib-biter were more likely to perform the behaviour due to a genetic component. Gastrointestinal environment and feeding routines were also a crucial topic, hinting that perhaps grain concentrations, grain ratios and forages were the main cause of ulcers, causing the animal to perform the oral stereotypy as a method of comfort. Horses that were unable to partake in a feeding behaviour that it wants to partake in would influence cribbing. Since the animal is unable to easily digest large quantities of starch, it was found that a high-grain, low forage diet could cause cribbing. A low-forage, high-grain diet was found to increase the risk of the stereotypy because the behaviour aided with relieving stomach acidity. It has been anecdotally claimed that horses can learn to copy these behaviors from other horses, although this has not been substantiated by scientific study. A study in 2009 found that 48.8% of US horse owners believed that cribbing could be learned by observation, but research demonstrated that only 1.0% of horses developed cribbing after being housed in sight of an affected horse. Functions Stereotypies are sometimes considered to be a coping mechanism for animals experiencing stress. A physiological stress response can be induced by injecting an animal with ACTH and the animal's ability to cope with this stress can be monitored by measuring salivary cortisol. In a 2015 study, after ACTH injection, cribbers had higher cortisol levels than non-cribbers. Furthermore, cribbers which did not perform the stereotypy during the 3-hrs of testing had higher cortisol levels than non- cribbers, whereas those performing the stereotypy did not. The researchers concluded that cribbing is a coping mechanism to stressful situations and that because of this, it should not be prevented. Cribbing and wind-sucking may cause a sensation of pleasure by releasing endorphins in the horse's brain. It has also been suggested that the increase in saliva produced during wind- sucking could be a mechanism for neutralizing stomach conditions in stable- kept, grain-fed horses. Stereotypies have been defined as \\"repetitive, invariant behaviour patterns with no obvious goal or function\\", therefore, if cribbing and wind-sucking have one of the above possible functions, it may be inappropriate to label them as a stereotypy. However, as the causes and resulting reinforcement for these behaviors are probably multifactorial and they remain abnormal behaviors, this indicates that husbandry changes are needed for animals that exhibit cribbing or wind-sucking. A study suggested was that ghrelin levels were higher in a crib-biting horse than in those who did not perform the behaviour. Cribbing also increased salivary secretion. However, a different study found that there was no relation between salivary secretion and reducing gastric acidity. Meaning that cribbing did not provide comfort for ulcers, rather that it stimulated/caused this issue. Treatment Several methods have been devised to prevent cribbing once the behavior has started. However, some ethologists have argued that prevention of the behavior without addressing the causes is not a cure and may result in cribbing being expressed in a modified form, or may interfere with an animal’s attempt to adapt to its environment. =Dietary and management= It has been shown that feeding cribbing horses an antacid diet can significantly reduce the frequency of the behavior. Current research indicates that the prevention of cribbing and related behavior is based upon management conditions which allow daily free movement and feeding practices that provide higher amounts of roughage and limited amounts of concentrates. A growing body of work suggests that fat and fiber-based diets may also result in calmer patterns of behavior. One study investigated the effects of providing a feeder that delivered small amounts of concentrate feed when activated by the animal. The feeder increased the feeding time of both cribbers and non-cribbers, however, although the feeder decreased cribbing, it increased again once the feeder was removed. =Physical devices= There are a number of traditional devices used to minimize or prevent cribbing and wind-sucking. However, the effectiveness of these methods is arguable since they do not address the underlying causal factors. If the behaviour is stress related, the use of a cribbing collar may be counterproductive because it would not allow the animal to release the stress hormones by performing the behaviour and that cribbing may be beneficial in reducing stress. One method involves the horse wearing a collar- like device that stops a horse from arching and swelling its neck to suck in air. However, one of the only studies of the equipment showed that although wearing such a collar for 24 hours reduced cribbing in six of eight horses, once the collar was removed, cribbing returned to greater levels than before. The authors concluded cribbing has a function and that preventing this by using anti-cribbing collars may compromise the horse's welfare. Covering exposed edges with metal or wire or painting surfaces with bitter substances such as carbolineum or a commercial \\"chew stop\\" product may reduce chewing- related damage to surfaces, though this does not prevent edges from being gripped by the teeth. =Surgical and others= Other methods to prevent cribbing have included surgery, acupuncture, use of pharmaceuticals, operant feeding, and environmental enrichment. However, a study found that the use of pharmaceuticals was expensive, less popular and less effective. One surgical technique is the modified Forssell's procedure in which muscles and nerves in the ventral neck region are cut as well as some muscle tissue being removed. This makes it more difficult for a horse to contract the larynx and exhibit cribbing. An adaptation of this technique using a laser has proved successful in preventing some cribbers from exhibiting the behavior, although this was less successful in horses which had been cribbers for more than three years prior to the surgery.

An eccentric landscape designer, he gave four of his sons the names Hiram, Euclid, Vitruvius and Archimedes. He published extensively, and attempted to \\"improve\\" Gothic forms by giving them classical proportions. A garden plan by Langley for Orleans House in Twickenham. Early life Langley was baptised in Twickenham, Middlesex, the son of a jobbing gardener Daniel Langley and his wife Elizabeth. He bore the name of David Batty, one of his father's patrons. He started worked as a gardener, inheriting some of his father's clients in Twickenham, then a village of suburban villas within easy reach of London by a pleasant water journey on the Thames. An early client was Thomas Vernon of Twickenham Park. He married Anne Smith in February 1719. They had four children, but she died in June 1726. He had ten further children with his second wife, Catherine. Landscape gardening Langley moved into surveying and landscape gardening. He published his first book, Practical Geometry, in 1726. Inspired by Switzer's Ichnographia Rustica of 1718, Langley advocated more irregular, informal gardens, with rococo \\"arti-natural\\" landscaping. His sinuous forms predated William Hogarth's line of beauty. For the Palladian house built at Twickenham by James Johnston in 1710 (later Orleans House, demolished 1926), Langley, probably on his own endeavour, prepared and published a garden plan, which offered an encyclopaedia of the garden features that were swiftly becoming obsolete by the time the plan was published in Langley's A Sure Method of Improving Estates (1728): here are several mazes, a \\"wilderness\\" with many tortuous path-turnings, cabinets de verdure cut into dense woodland, formal stretches of canal and formally shaped basins of water, some with central fountains, and a central allée of trees leading to an exedra. His New Principles of Gardening (1728) included designs for mazes, a feature he could never quite leave behind, with 28 plates engraved by his brother Thomas. He also published A Sure Method of Improving Estates (1728) and Pomona (1729). He also undertook work at Castle Howard in North Yorkshire and Wrest Park in Bedfordshire. Architecture Langley moved from Twickenham to London in 1729, and shifted again from landscape gardening to architecture. Working near Exeter Change in the Strand, he published A Sure Guide to Builders in 1729. He moved to Westminster in the 1730s, where he started to teach drawing, geometry, architecture, and garden design, and continued to teach when he moved to Soho in 1738. He also made and sold stone garden ornaments. Despite his literary aspirations, and advertisements in architectural journals, he secured few commissions, submitting an unsolicited proposal for the competition to design a new Mansion House in 1735 and a design for a new Westminster Bridge in 1736-7. He inclined strongly towards a home-grown English architectural form, publishing articles in the Grub Street Journal under the pseudonym \\"Hiram\\" from July 1734 to March 1735, praising Gothic architecture (or as he termed it \\"native Saxon\\") and rejecting the \\"imported\\" Palladian architecture favoured by Lord Burlington and his circle. He published a wide range of architectural books, from a huge folio on Ancient Masonry in parts from 1733 to 1736 with over 450 plates, through The Builder's Complete Assistant of 1738 (also known as The Builder's Complete Chest-Book) and The Builder's Jewel of 1741, to the tiny The Workman's Golden Rule in 1750, in vicesimo-quarto. He is best known for one of his confident self- promotions, Ancient Architecture, Restored, and Improved published in 1742 and reissued in 1747 as Gothic Architecture, improved by Rules and Proportions, a bit of cockscombry that thoroughly irritated Horace Walpole, whose Gothick villa at Twickenham, Strawberry Hill, gave impetus to the stirrings of the Gothic Revival: > All that his books achieved, has been to teach carpenters to massacre that > venerable species, and to give occasion to those who know nothing of the > matter, and who mistake his clumsy efforts for real imitations, to censure > the productions of our ancestors, whose bold and beautiful fabrics Sir > Christopher Wren viewed and reviewed with astonishment, and never mentioned > without esteem. (Walpole, Anecdotes of Painting, 1798, p 484) His book, with engravings by his brother Thomas, attempted to improve Gothic forms by giving them classical proportions and to create a scheme of architectural orders for Gothic architecture. He provided inspiration for elements of buildings from Great Fulford and Hartland Abbey in Devon, to Speedwell Castle in Brewood in Staffordshire, and Tissington Hall in Derbyshire, and the Gothic temple at Bramham Park in Yorkshire, and gates at Castletown House in County Kildare. Langley's books were also enormously influential in Britain's American colonies. At Mount Vernon, for example, George Washington relied upon plate 51 of Langley's The City and Country Builder's and Workman's Treasury of Designs as the source for the famous Venetian (or Palladian) window in the dining room; upon plate 54 of the same book for the ocular window on Mount Vernon's western facade; and upon plate 75 of Langley's The Builder's Jewel for the rusticated wood siding.The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., \\"Palladio and Architectural Patternbooks in Colonial America.\\" Batty Langley was also thought to be an important Freemason; his naming of his son Hiram was a reference to the architect, prominent in Masonic tradition and symbolism, of Solomon's Temple, and many of his books were dedicated to his Masonic brethren. The frontispiece to The Builder's Jewel (1741), for example, contains many examples of Masonic symbolism found in the first three degrees of Freemasonry.See Eileen Harris, Batty Langley: A Tutor to Freemasons (1696-1751), The Burlington Magazine, Vol.119, No 890, May 1977 He was imprisoned for debt in Newgate Prison and wrote an account of that institution, An Accurate Description of Newgate.An Accurate Description of Newgate at Google Books He died at home in Soho.

He was commissioned to complete a Madonna enthroned with four saints for the church of Santa Giustina in Padua in 1513.Museo Civico, Padua The coloration of the painting is of Venetian style, but the duller visages in bejeweled setting recalls styles of previous generations. He completed series of frescoes for Niccolò Orsini's Palace in Ghedi. Romanino completed four frescoes in the nave of the cathedral of Cremona in 1519-1520 depicting stories of the Passion of Christ. His paintings have eclectic influences using Venetian coloration with Florentine-Lombard modeling. In the Cremona frescoes, the Lombard influence of Altobello Melone is strong, in the narrative and decorative elements of the fresco.Freedberg SJ. p 363 By 1521, Romanino was replaced by Il Pordenone in the decoration of the church.

It lies about north east of Imphal.  History  It was marked out first as a sub-division in 1919 during the British Raj. It was later upgraded to a full-fledged district, bearing the nomenclature of Manipur East District in November 1969 by the Government of India. Linguistically, the Tangkhuls belong to a large language family called Sino-Tibetan, and within that family to the sub-family Tibeto- Burman. In general this points towards an origin in the north, that is south- west China and Tibet. The earliest home of the Tangkhuls was the upper reaches of the Huang heo and Yangtze Rivers which lies in the Zinjiang province of China. Like the other desert areas of the world, the people including the Tangkhuls, due to hardship of life, dispersed from this place to different directions. One group moved towards the east and southeast to be become known as Chinese, and another group moved southward to become the tribes of Tibeto- Burman, which includes the Tangkhuls and other tribes. That was between c, 10,000 B.C. to 8000 B.C. This movement has continued into recent historic times. S.K. Chatterjee noted that from 2000 B.C. onwards, Sino-Tibetan speakers from China pushed south and west and entered India. According to W.I. Singh, in his The History of Manipur, the Tangkhuls settled in the Samshok (Thuangdut) area in Myanmar. They belong to the Yakkha tribe in China. The Tangkhuls were first noticed in Manipur by Poireiton, one of the earliest kings of a principality in Manipur valley. The Tangkhuls and other Naga tribes came to Manipur, Nagaland, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh through Myanmar. Some of them also settled down in Myanmar and did not venture further. However, their movement over Myanmar and into India was spread over a period of time. They entered the present habitat in waves following one another and in some cases in close succession. The Tangkhuls came together with the Zeliangrongs, Maos, Poumeis, Marams and Thangals because all of them have references to their dispersal from Makhel, a Mao village in Senapati district. They had also erected megaliths at Makhel in memory of their having dispersed from there to various directions. The Tangkhuls point to the association of their forefathers with the seashore. Most of the ornaments of the Tangkhuls such as kongsang and huishon were made of sea shells. Cowrie and conch shells are prominent features of the people who live on the shore. By the 2nd century AD the Tangkhuls were living in Samshok (Thuangdut) in Myanmar. Ptolemy, a Greek astronomer and geographer of Alexandria, in his Geography of Further India c. 140 AD, referred to the Tangkhul (Nangalogue) at Triglypton (Thuangdut). The Tangkhuls began to disperse from Samshok after the invasion of Ko-lo-feng and his successor I-mau-shun the king of Nan-chao in the closing part of the 8th century AD and beginning of the 9th century AD. They were further driven towards the north-west of Myanmar by the Shan people. Thus, the Tangkhuls as also other Naga tribes travelled from China to Myanmar, and from there finally they came into their present land traversing through innumerable snow-covered landscapes, mountains and wild forests, confronting wild beasts and wild tribes. The exodus of the Tangkhuls from China to Myanmar and finally to India is a story of heroism of human migration, courage and endurance. In course of time every Tangkhul village became a small republic like the Greek city states. Every village had an unwritten constitution made up of age-old conventions and traditions. The Tangkhul villages were self-sufficient except for salt, and self-governing units ruled by a hereditary or elected chief assisted by a council of elders. The chief was a judge, administrator and commander rolled into one. However, the absence of a national government was disastrous for them in the mediaeval period as the small village states were unable to withstand the onslaught of the organised army invasion like Khagi (Chinese), Awa (Burmese), etc. The Kangleipak king or Meitei king always protects his people from foreign invasion. Some examples of historic events like during the reign of King Telheiba 1335-1355 AD protected from Khagi Army (Chinese) and Awa Army (Burmese) invasion. During the reign of King Khagemba 1596-1651 AD of Kangleipak Kingdom, he just not only protected Chinese invasion but even defeated and conquered a Chinese Chieftain rule town somewhere in the present Yunan provinces of China. The ancient Tangkhul history is hitherto an unrecorded past. History however became more enlightened by the beginning of the 13th century owing to the cultural, trade and sometimes turbulent relations which had grown up with the people of the valley. There is a reference to the Tangkhuls as early as the 13th century during the reign of Thawanthaba (1195-1231 AD) of Kangleipak Kingdom. The chronicles refer to the punishment in some hill tribe villages for not giving their protection tax to their king. The most severe punishment was for cutting down a tree unnecessarily. The Kangleipak King had a strict rule against deforestation. For example, a law said that if one cuts a tree, he must plant a tree somewhere around. The Meitei believed that cutting down excess trees cause floods in the valley and landslides in the hills area country road, which make the army patrol team difficult to keep an eye of protection for their capital kingdom within the nine mountain ranges. The particular village's chief had to pay the price as a punishment for disturbing mother nature if he was found guilty in trial. Even in many a case the hierarchy Chieftain Hood position was alter with their sibling if a particular village chief act against the king's order. So there was a growth of anti-Meitei sentiment since early days. A historical proof of separatist rebellion when King Tabungba (1359-1394) was assassinated by Chingdai village chieftain while he was there for taking direct consent from the village chief for not showing up in the religious ancestral festival of Mera Hou Chongba for Kangleicha (people of Kangleipak). It was well known that Chingdai village chief wife (daughter of Chingsong village chief) was a childhood lover of King Tabungba while they were young, before he took the throne in 1359. There has always been some form of relationship between the Tangkhuls and the Meiteis in terms of political alliances and trade relations. Some items of Hao (Highlander of Kangleipak Kingdom) material - culture indicate a long history of contact between the plain and hills. The \\"Elephant Cloth\\" (Leirungphi), for instance, resplendent with complex animal designs, worn by the Hao of Manipur, has its origin in the wish of the ruler of Manipur in the mid-seventeenth to present his village's chief with a special cloth. The popular Tangkhul shawl \\"changkhom\\" is also known as \\"karaophi\\" in Manipur. The Tangkhul dance (pheichak) was known as \\"chingkheirol\\" in Manipur, from the fact that it came from Chingkhei (north east of Imphal). During the reign of the most powerful Meitei King Pamheiba a.k.a. Garib Nawaz (1709–1748) for the first time, the heartland rebellion area of the Tangkhul villages was brought under peace. In 1716, the king's forces invaded the great Tangkhul village of Hundung and 68 prisoners were captured. In 1733, the king sent a military expedition to Ukhrul to destroy the rebellion force. The outcome of the expeditions incurred heavy casualty on the King's forces; the royal chronicles record the death of 70 Meitei soldiers. The Ningek inscription of King Garib Nawaz refers to the Khullakpa of Okhrul (Ukhrul). Ukhrul was the headquarters of the Tangkhul Long (Tangkhul Assembly), as well as the Tangkhul annual fair locally known as \\"Leh Khangapha\\" used to be held at Somsai in Ukhrul. A more significant relationship between the hills and the valley took place during the reign of Bhagyachandra (1759–1762 and 1763–1798). In 1779 King Bhagyachandra established a new capital at Langthabal about seven kilometers south east of Imphal. For the next 17 years Langthabal remained as the capital. He employed many Tangkhul and Kabui Nagas in the digging of moats around the new capital of Langthabal. Of the Tangkhul chiefs, Khullakpa of Hungpung and Hunphun made friendship with the king. The relationship between the Tangkhuls and the Meiteis during the mediaeval period was not only of wars and conquests. They also carried out trade and commerce. The Tangkhuls supplied cotton to the valley. They also sold and purchased in the Sanakeithel, the principal market in Imphal. The Tangkhuls used Manipuri coins of bell-metal locally called \\"sel\\" as a medium of exchange which was first introduced during the reign of Khagemba (1597–1652). The boundary of Manipur and Burma (Myanmar) was laid down by an agreement signed between the British authorities (East India Company) and Burma on 9 January 1834 on the river bank of Nighthee (Chindwin). The Article No.4 (iii) of this agreement relates to the Tangkhul villages. In the period of World War II, the Ukhrul area was also affected by war. Gnanpeeth awardee recorded about this area that in the 1950s the highway between Imphal and Ukhrul was partially demolished, and hill areas in Ukhrul had signs of war attacks. People and their hearts also seem to be wounded out of war.Janavahini (preface): Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya: sahitya akademy press: 1983 \\"Fourth (iii) - On the north, the line of boundary will begin at the foot of the same hills at the northern extremity of the Kabo Valley and pass due north up to the first range of hills, east of that upon which stand the villages of Chortor (Choithar), Noongbee (Nungbi), Nonghar (Nunghar), of the tribe called by the Munepooriis (Manipuris) Loohooppa (Tangkhul), and by the Burmahs Lagwensoung, now tributary of Manipoor.\\" As a result of this boundary demarcation without the knowledge let alone consent of the Tangkhuls, many Tangkhul villages situated in Somrah hills are included under Burma. Later, when India and Burma attained national independence, the Tangkhuls found themselves totally dismembered belonging to two different countries.  Geography Ukhrul as a town not only stands for administrative headquarters but it is also a place where all the traditional institutions of the Tangkhuls are located. The town is home to about 75000 people from all walks of life. Phangrei is another ideal spot for couples. =Flora and fauna= Ukhrul District is best known for the Shirui lily (Lilium mackliniae Sealy), which is found in its natural habitat on the peak of Shirui Kashong, some 18 km east of the district headquarters, and Khangkhui Mangsor cave which lies 16 kilometers away from the town. Administrative divisions The district is divided into four sub-divisions: * Ukhrul * Lungchong-Maiphai * Chingai * Jessami Recently, Kamjong District is carved out from Ukhrul district comprising sub-divisions of Kamjong, Sahamphung, Kasom Khullen, and Phungyar. Transport The district headquarters, Ukhrul, is linked with Imphal, the state capital, by national highway 150. This highway also links Ukhrul with Kohima via Jessami. It has the distinction of being the highest hill station of Manipur. There are also many district roads and village roads. Ukhrul-Kamjong, and Ukhrul- Phungyar Road are the main metalled roads of the district. The Tampak-Ngashan (Mahadev)- Pfutsero road connects the western part of the district with the district headquarters.  Demographics  According to the 2011 census Ukhrul district has a population of 183,998, roughly equal to the nation of Sao Tome and Principe. This gives it a ranking of 593rd in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 30.07%. Ukhrul has a sex ratio of 948 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 81.87%. The Tangkhul form the majority ethnic group in this district. According to oral tribal legend whenever a robust, strong, fair child is born in a Meitei family the elders of the family praise god for sending a Tangkhul in the family. This legend is strongly supported by the cultural relation of the Meitei and the Tangkhul. Though the district has not seen much developmental work so far, the place has produced many famous personalities of Manipur. The district is the home town to two Manipuri chief ministers, Yangmaso Shaiza and Rishang Keishing. It is also the home town of the first Indian ambassador from the north-east region, Bob Khathing. The district has also produced the first vice Chancellor from the North-East, Prof. Darlando Khathing, presently the VC of Central University of Jharkhand. The district has also produced the first IAS and IFS officers of the state – Christianson Chibber and PrimRose R Sharma. Besides Ameising Luikham, who is an IAS officer from the hill district of the state, Dr. Pam Shaiza, the first female tribal doctor, and Siraphui Marinao, the first tribal engineer of the state, also hail from Ukhrul. Ukhrul district is the home of the Tangkhuls. They are a highly cultured people. The name Tangkhul was given to them by their neighbours, the Meiteis. The northern Tangkhuls were also called the Luhupas. Languages *Tangkhul language *Sorbung language *Pochuri language *Tarao language *Thadou language Culture = Places of interest = Besides the Shirui lily, the district is known for many natural wonders like the Khangkhui Mangsor, Mova (cave) which is one of the oldest archeological cave of India. Ukhrul town, the headquarters of the district, has also many scenic places like the Duncan park, the Japanese pond, and Elshadai park. At the southern part of the town, about 22 km lies the majestic Phangrei (bone of contention between two villages) which is an ideal picnic spot. The district is also home to many waterfalls, of which Khayang waterfall, which is about 20 km from Ukhrul, is very famous. There is also another famous picnic spot for youngsters called KNC river (Khangkhui, Nungshong Choithar); near the large river there was a different attractive spot for people coming for picnics. In the past this spot was called Saibai Kong; the title was given by Choithar Headman during kingship period. Ukhrul is also a tourist hotspot of Manipur state. It is known for its hospitality and festivals. Almost every month festivals are celebrated by different villages and towns. The chief festivals of the Tangkhuls are Luira (seed sowing festival), Mangkhap (resting feast), Thisham (feast for the departed), and Thareo (harvest festival). Longpi village is known for its authentic Tangkhul cuisine during the Luira festival. While Ringui village is known for its celebration of Luira festival, during the festival the village comes alive with the traditional dances (bridal dance, parade of the virgin dance, festive dance and war dance) and songs. The famous war dance is performed during this festival. Ringui village is also known for production of films, music and plays of the Tangkhuls.  Education  In earlier days when education was sparse and primitive, Ukhrul was a well sought after place for the different tribes of the north east. The first school was set up by the then missionary Rev. William Pettigrew in 1896. Since then, not only has the place increased in the number of schools and colleges but it has produced many scholars and professionals in various fields. The first tribal person from the north east to teach in the prestigious Delhi University hails from the district (Prof. Horam). Today, with more than 90% literate population, Ukhrul is considered as the most educated town of the state next to the capital city Imphal. Some of the well known schools of the town are Sacred Heart Higher Secondary School, Alice Christian Higher Secondary School, Ktl Excel Higher Secondary School, Little Angels School, Savio School, Blesso Montessori School, Holy Spirit School, Patkai Academy, Juniors Academy, Sentinel College, Saint John School and Pettigrew College, Kendriya Vidyalaya and Jawahar Lal Novadaya Vidyalaya . Though the Tangkhuls are a highly educated community, hardly have they abandoned the traditional way of life. In many villages, to the delights of the tourist, one still sees the enchanting traditional lives of the past. The highest cultural and judicial institution of the Tangkhuls is the Tangkhul Naga Long, which was established in 1929 under the name all Tangkhul students conference. Realising the need of an organization that covers the whole community the organisation was changed to the Tangkhul Long in 1936. To this day all the disputes within the community is settled through the court of the LONG (organisation).

It is his attempt to define English culture and the English people for the rest of the world as he fears that it might soon be wiped from earth by the Nazi armies. He also states that England would not change into a fascist state and cannot unless she is thoroughly broken. The essay is in fact the first part of The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius, published 19 January 1941, as the first volume of a series edited by T. R. Fyvel and Orwell, in the Searchlight Books published by Secker & Warburg.Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.). The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 2: My Country Right or Left (1940–1943) (Penguin) Orwell also describes England as one of the most democratic nations on the earth at the time, but that it lacked a true and correct worldview and replaced it with a level of fervent patriotism. He exemplifies this with reference to the fact that English gentry and businessmen thought Fascism was a system that was compatible with the English economy. The gentry believed that simply because Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler were staunchly opposed to communism that their views were \\"England-friendly\\" and thus they cheered whenever Mussolini's bombers would sink a ship ferrying supplies to support Spanish republicans. It was not until the election came around and they realised that Franco's accession would be a severe blow to England. Thus they realised that Fascism is bad for England due to its revolutionary origins or heavily military- dependent system of policing and control. Orwell himself, however, admits that Fascism is a better system for the wealthy, unless you were a Jew, than Communism or democratic socialism. Orwell argues that Britain, although divided between many nationalities such as Scots, Welshmen, English, etc..., everyone considers themselves British as soon as a need to defend their land arises. He also theorises that it might be more appropriate to divide Britons by financial classes which would result in two, or maybe even three or four, Britains. Quotations *\\"As I write, highly civilised human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill me.\\" *\\"They do not feel any enmity against me as an individual, nor I against them. They are 'only doing their duty', as the saying goes. Most of them would never dream of committing murder in private life. On the other hand, if one of them succeeds in blowing me to pieces with a well-placed bomb, he will never sleep any the worse for it. He is serving his country, which has the power to absolve him from evil.\\" *\\"One gets a better view of this question if one considers the minor point first. It is quite true that the so-called races of Britain feel themselves to be very different from one another. A Scotsman, for instance, does not thank you if you call him an Englishman. You can see the hesitation we feel on this point by the fact that we call our islands by no less than six different names, England, Britain, Great Britain, the British Isles, the United Kingdom and, in very exalted moments, Albion. Even the differences between north and south England loom large in our own eyes. But somehow these differences fade away the moment that any two Britons are confronted by a European. It is very rare to meet a foreigner, other than an American, who can distinguish between English and Scots or even English and Irish. To a Frenchman, the Breton and the Auvergnat seem very different beings, and the accent of Marseilles is a stock joke in Paris. Yet we speak of 'France' and 'the French', recognising France as an entity, a single civilisation, which in fact it is. So also with ourselves. Looked at from the outsider even the cockney and the Yorkshireman have a strong family resemblance.\\" *\\"And even the distinction between rich and poor dwindles somewhat when one regards the nation from the outside. There is no question about the inequality of wealth in England. It is grosser than in any European country, and you have only to look down the nearest street to see it. Economically, England is certainly two nations, if not three or four. But at the same time the vast majority of the people feel themselves to be a single nation and are conscious of resembling one another more than they resemble foreigners. Patriotism is usually stronger than class-hatred, and always stronger than any kind of internationalism. Except for a brief moment in 1920 (the 'Hands off Russia' movement) the British working class have never thought or acted internationally. For two and a half years they watched their comrades in Spain slowly strangled, and never aided them by even a single strike. But when their own country (the country of Lord Nuffield and Mr Montagu Norman) was in danger, their attitude was very different. At the moment when it seemed likely that England might be invaded, Anthony Eden appealed over the radio for Local Defence Volunteers. He got a quarter of a million men in the first twenty-four hours, and another million in the subsequent month. One has only to compare these figures with, for instance, the number of conscientious objectors to see how vast is the strength of traditional loyalties compared with new ones.\\" *\\"The intellectuals who hope to see it Russianised or Germanised will be disappointed. The gentleness, the hypocrisy, the thoughtlessness, the reverence for law and the hatred of uniforms will remain, along with the suet puddings and the misty skies. It needs some very great disaster, such as prolonged subjugation by a foreign enemy, to destroy a national culture. The Stock Exchange will be pulled down, the horse plough will give way to the tractor, the country houses will be turned into children's holiday camps, the Eton and Harrow match will be forgotten, but England will still be England, an everlasting animal stretching into the future and the past, and, like all living things, having the power to change out of recognition and yet remain the same.\\" *\\"In intention, at any rate, the English intelligentsia are Europeanized. They take their cookery from Paris and their opinions from Moscow. In the general patriotism of the country they form a sort of island of dissident thought. England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during ‘God save the King’ than of stealing from a poor box.\\" See also *Bibliography of George Orwell  References  External links * Online text Category:Essays by George Orwell Category:1941 essays ","title":"England Your England"},{"id":"3390787","text":"Fotis Constantine Kafatos (; 16 April 1940 – 18 November 2017) was a Greek biologist.

However, Yahoo China filed a lawsuit against Beijing Sanjiwuxian Internet Technology Co. Ltd, the developer of the 360Safe antispyware for identifying Yahoo Assistant as malware in 360Safe. Distribution 3721 Internet Assistant was originally released as a normal client-server application. However, it turned to use ActiveX technology to install itself on a client system later and was also shipped with many sharewares as default install options. 3721 Internet Assistant was also blamed for its use of a flaw in Microsoft Internet Explorer to install itself automatically when a user is browsing an array of 3721 sponsored personal and commercial websites with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Yahoo! Assistant is also included in 3721 Chinese Keywords and Yahoo!

Mon has a sex ratio of 899 females for every 1000 males, and an average literacy rate of 56.99%. Culture Mon district is the home of the Konyak Nagas. The Konyaks are famous for their tattooed faces and bodies. The most colourful festival of the Konyaks, Aoling (Aoleng), is observed during the first week of April every year. Konyaks are the largest tribe among the Nagas. They speak the Konyak Language, a Sino-Tibetan language, with each village having their local dialect. The Konyaks were the last practising headhunters among the Nagas which continued into the 1960s. The tribe embraced Christianity during the late 20th and early 21st century. Konyaks decorate their houses with skulls, hornbill beaks, elephant tusks, horns and wooden statues. Konyaks are ruled by hereditary chiefs known as Anghs, and the institution of Anghship is still prevalent among the Konyaks. Every village has an Angh. Some of the smaller villages are ruled over by neighbouring village Anghs. The Angh's house is always the largest in the village, with a display of skulls in the front as a testament to his capability as a leader. Anghs still rule over the villages of Chui, Mon, Shangnyu, Tangnyu, Sheanghah Chingnyu, Wakching and Yannu. Konyaks are adept artisans and skilled craftsmen. They make excellent wood carvings, daos (machetes), guns, gunpowder, head brushes, headgear, necklaces, etc. The older males wear large earrings made of boar horn and a loincloth. Some carry a machete called dao or a gun. The older women wear a short piece of cloth wrapped around their waist only. They carry bamboo baskets on their backs or tie children to their backs with a cloth. The Konyak women are adept in weaving intricate traditional designs and in bead craft. Both men and women wear a lot of traditional bead and brass ornaments. During festivals, the males wear colorful shawls and headgear decorated with feathers, and dance with daos or spears and guns chanting/singing rhythmically. They brew a home- brewed liquor made out of rice. They also farm in the hills by clearing the forests using a method of controlled burning called \\"Jhum\\". Tourism =Place of attraction= Ceremonial basket of the Konyak Naga Shangnyu village Ruled by the chief Angh, Shangnyu village is one of the prominent villages in Mon district.

No act of legislature passed by the Nagaland Legislative Assembly had any effect unless it was approved by the Governor on the recommendation of the regional council. There was a special Ministry for Tuensang Affairs in Nagaland Government. The members to the Legislative Assembly were not elected directly by the people, but by a regional council.

The climate in the Bhandari range is slightly warmer with little lesser compared to the middle and upper ranges.  History  =British Colonial Administration= In the Lotha Naga areas, Captain Brodie was the first official to carry out colonial exploration in 1844. The first recorded meeting between a European and the Lothas was with Lieutenant Biggs in the year 1841. During the British colonial expansion into the Naga Hills, Wokha was designated the district headquarters initially. Two years later, it was shifted to Kohima in 1878, and Wokha was reduced to a sub- division in the colonial administration. The sub-divisional administration shifted its headquarters to Mokokchung further relegating Wokha in the colonial administration. =Indian state= In 1957, when the Naga Hills Tuensang Area (NHTA) was formed, Wokha became a sub-division under the Mokokchung district.

Synopsis Valérian and Laureline are in the Ukbar system assisting human colonists who have settled on its four planets. Their job almost complete, they are now on a farewell tour of inspection. Arriving at Ukbar I, Valérian delivers his farewell speech at a reception in honour of the two agents from Galaxity. Later, one of the colonists invites Valérian to sample one of the first products of their new world – an alcoholic beverage distilled from algae. Proceeding to Ukbar II, Valérian delivers the same speech and again is invited to sample some of the locals' homemade booze. Laureline is alarmed when a somewhat intoxicated Valérian takes the astroship wildly off course on the way to Ukbar III. On Ukbar III, Valérian stumbles through the speech before being offered to try out the alcohol made on this planet. Returning to the astroship, Valérian falls over and Laureline at last realises he is drunk. Refusing to allow Laureline to pilot the ship, he makes a mess of the landing on Ukbar IV. Emerging from the ship, Valérian and Laureline discover the colony is deserted. Everyone is gathered in the observatory – a rogue planet has been spotted and it's on a collision course with the Ukbar system. With the cargo ships dismantled, there is no way to evacuate the colonists. Valérian makes another speech, promising to deal with the situation and then takes off with Laureline for the planet. While Valérian sleeps off the drink, Laureline makes the space-time jump to the planet. Exploring the surface they find it to be a lifeless, airless, barren rock but their curiosity is piqued by some phosphorescent lakes. Taking a launch from the astroship, they dive into one of the lakes and are astonished when they emerge on the other side – it is a hollow planet! Light is provided by the planet's nucleus and there is a small rocky moon in orbit. Searching for a place to land they see a strange sight – houses pulled by animals. Suddenly a section of the ridge one of the houses is travelling along gives way. Valérian swoops in with the launch and saves the house and its inhabitants from falling. Landing, a man introduces himself as Mutahar of the Lemm people of the planet Zahir. They are nomads who travel in the shadow of the moon collecting explosive flogums which they sell to the cities Malka and Valsennar. Suddenly a great wind rips through the camp. Mutahar explains that this is caused by the war between Malka and Valsennar – they use the flogums as weapons in the fight. Laureline checks the measuring devices in the launch – the detonation of the flogums during the battles is what is causing Zahir to tumble through space. The pair realise there is only once course of action open to them – stop the war. The pair split up – Valérian travels with the Lemm men to Malka, since women are forbidden from entering the city while Laureline travels with the Lemm women to Valsennar since men are forbidden from entering that city. Reaching Malka, Valérian parts company with the Lemm and gains entry through the city's considerable fortifications via the sewer system. Exploring the back streets, Valérian is surprised to see only men – cooking, cleaning, looking after the children. Soon he finds out where the women are when a formidable group of riders, all female, round up a group of the men. They are to be conscripts in the war with Valsennar – Valérian and the rest of the men are put through intensive military training. Later, resting in the barracks, the other men tell Valérian that they are at war with Valsennar because that city is ruled by men – a perversion of the natural order: men are inferior. Few men survive the battles and those that do are sent to the Palace of Supreme Femininity for reproductive duties. Elsewhere, Laureline reaches Valsennar and, like Valérian, parts company with the Lemm. Unlike Malka, Valsennar is a beautiful city with canals, gardens and sumptuous palaces. Wandering the back streets, Laureline meets an old lady, Nadjika, who persuades her to enter the emperor's beauty contest. Despite making a mess of the cooking, weaving and singing elements of the competition, the emperor, Alzafar, takes a shine to her and declares her the winner. She is brought back to the Palace of Resplendent Virility to join his harem. On the way they pass the emperor's war fleet. Laureline notices that all the soldiers are women – the emperor explains that women do all the work in Valsennar including fighting. The day of the battle comes and the war fleet of airships and flying elytrons (insects) takes off from Malka led by Queen Klopka the Ravishing. At the same time the war fleet of Valsennar takes off with the flagship of Emperor Alzafar and his court bring up the rear where they can enjoy the spectacle of the fight. The battle is engaged near the sun and Valérian is soon caught up in the bloody combat. In an attempt to impress the queen, taking an elytron flogum carrier he destroys several of Valsennar's ships and makes a successful bombing run on the Palace of Resplendent Virility before making to attack the emperor's flagship. This throws everyone on board into a panic – no one has ever attacked the emperor's ship before – except Laureline who grabs a crossbow and shoots the attacker down. Seconds later, she is horrified to see that it's Valérian. Valérian manages to save himself by jumping onto a drifting ship. Returning to Malka, Valérian is given his own apartments in the Palace of Supreme Femininity while Laureline is now the emperor's favorite in the surviving wing of the Palace of Resplendent Virility. Calling Valérian on her radio, Laureline is delighted to find Valérian is unharmed. They decide that they must kidnap the two monarchs and bring them together to find a way to end the conflict. Valérian knocks out Queen Klopka with a stunner and Laureline drugs Emperor Alzafar's drink. Meeting at the launch, they decide the best thing to do is to show the queen and the emperor the universe outside Zahir in the hope that they will then understand the peril they are in. They are disturbed when Klopka and Alzafar come round and begin fighting with each other. Pulling them apart, Valérian and Laureline calm them down and put them both in the launch. When they pass through into the outside of Zahir, Klopka and Alzafar see the stars for the first time. They are so shocked they go into a dead faint straight away. Bringing them to the astroship Valérian uses the hypnotic instruction machinery there to describe the universe to Klopka and Alzafar. Now aware of the danger they are in, they agree to put their differences aside and work to save Zahir and Ukbar. Valérian hatches a plan. The Malka, the Valsennar and the Lemm people all work together to gather as many flogums as possible and place them around the planet according to Valérian's instructions. At the right time, Valérian executes a series of spatio-temporal jumps detonating the flogums at the right time such that Zahir enters a safe orbit and becomes the fifth planet of Ukbar. The settlers of Ukbar and the Zahirians open up contact with a view to trade. On Zahir, society is rocked to discover that Klopka has married Alzafar and other marriages follow, leading to the collapse of the chauvinistic divisions between the two sides. Their mission completed, Valérian claims that he is not against the matriarchy system and to prove it he tells Laureline to get on with taking them back to Galaxity while he gets drunk on Zahirian alcohol. Main characters * Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent from Galaxity, future capital of Earth, in the 28th century * Laureline, originally from France in the 11th century, now a spatio-temporal agent of Galaxity in the 28th century * Klopka The Ravishing, queen of Malka * Alzafar, emperor of Valsennar * Muatahar, of the Lemm people, a prospector and trader in flogums * Nadjika, an old peasant from the back streets of Valsennar Settings * The Ukbar system, 28th century, the outer regions of the galaxy. Galaxity has colonised four planets in the system – Ukbar I is a waterworld where the settlers have built floating platforms like oil rigs, Ukbar II is a pastoral world, Ukbar III is industrial while Ukbar IV appears more barren. * The planet Zahir, on a collision course with Ukbar. The surface is barren and airless with phosphorescent lakes that lead into the hollow centre of the planet which is habitable. The core of the planet acts as a sun and it has a small moon in orbit around it. The explosive flogums grow in the shadow of the moon thanks to a property of its rays. The nomadic Lemm people follow the path of the moon and harvest the flogums for sale. There are two major cities on Zahir – Malka and Valsennar. The fortress-like Malka is ruled by women whereas Valsennar, with its delicate palaces and gardens is ruled by men. The regular explosions caused as result of the war between Malka and Valsennar have caused that planet to break free of the orbit around its sun and now it wanders through space, its inhabitants oblivious to the hazard it poses to other planets. Notes * In this album the two characters are separated for most of the adventure, allowing Laureline to come out from under Valérian's shadow for the first time. Second, while in the previous stories the two heroes encountered and fought obvious villains or evil geniuses, here the two races of Zahir are separated by ideology. The key plot point, that Valérian and Laureline must try to find some means of reconciliation between two opposing sides, will be repeated in many of the subsequent adventures. * The central concepts of this album use a number of well known science fiction clichés -- a hollow planet has been explored most notably by Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs, the notion of a catastrophe caused by a planetary collision has been seen in the film When Worlds Collide while the war-of-the-sexes concept crops up in Star Trek, Buck Rogers, Lost In Space and the like. * This album include visual and conceptual elements inspired by Frank Herbert's Dune, the French editions of which were published in 1970 and 1972, in the same period as this comic book. The Lemm people have \\"blue-in-blue\\" eyes like Dune's Fremen, their environment looks like planet Arrakis and they mine an explosive substance called 'flogum' (reminiscent of Dune's spice melange) which they sell to feuding houses reminiscent of Houses Atreides and Harkonnen. * This album was translated into English by L. Mitchell and published in 1984 by Dargaud USA in the United States of America () and in 1985 by Hodder Dargaud Ltd in the United Kingdom ().

MSU's fight song was created in early 1915 (and copyrighted in 1919), when MSU was known as Michigan Agricultural College (M.A.C.). An MSU cheerleader, Francis Irving Lankey, along with lyricist Arthur Sayles, created the song. With several changes noted below, the school has used the same song ever since. The MSU Fight Song is played at all university sporting events and is frequently sung by students and alumni. It has been ranked as the #6 best college fight song by the BleacherReportRanking the Top 50 College Fight Songs and called one of the NCAA's best fight songs by ESPN.The stories behind NCAA's best fight songs - ESPN History Prior to having a fight song, the MSU fans would sing the opponent's fight song being with its first victory over the University of Michigan in 1913. The next week, MSU defeated Wisconsin, it crown the win with “On Wisconsin.” In 1915, \\"MSU Fight Song\\" was written by Arthur Sayles and composed by Francis Irving Lanke. Upon the song's 100th anniversary, it was officially renamed from the \\"MSU Fight Song\\" to \\"Victory for MSU\\", which are the last three words of the song. Lyrics Lankey's original lyrics reflected the school's role as an agricultural college, as well as its rivalry with the University of Michigan. The lyrics have since been changed several times. The lyrics had to be modified when the school changed its nickname from the \\"Aggies\\" to the Spartans. In addition, whereas the original lyrics were written for an American football game against Michigan, the modern lyrics can be used for any opponent in any sport (although many hockey fans like to change the word \\"ball\\" to \\"hockey\\"). During football games, fans switch the lyrics from the current \\"Go right through for MSU\\" back to the former line, “Smash right through that line of blue\\"–a jab at Michigan. Versions Two arrangements of the fight song are played. *Falcone Fight is named for its arranger, longtime Spartan Marching Band Director Leonard Falcone. It includes the opening verse, the chorus (sung by the band with tuba and percussion accompaniment), the breakstrain, and a repeat of the chorus (played by all). This version requires about 1m:40s to play, and is performed in parade marches and in longer breaks during games, such as between football quarters or hockey periods. *Pregame Fight is a shorter arrangement by former Spartan Marching Band Assistant Director Bill Moffit (1960-1969), about 35 seconds long, that only includes the breakstrain (as introduction) and chorus. It is played during the football pregame show, after touchdowns and during game breaks (such as basketball timeouts) when time constraints prevent the full \\"Falcone\\" version. A shorter excerpt of this arrangement is frequently used during games to celebrate good plays; known as \\"C\\" for the rehearsal letter in the musical score, it begins at the line \\"See their team is weakening\\".

The reservation is located in parts of Big Horn, Yellowstone, and Treasure counties in southern Montana. It has a land area of 3,593.56 sq mi (9,307.27 km²) and a total area of 3,606.54 sq mi (9,340.89 km²), making it either the fifth or sixth largest reservation in the country. (Rankings are switched with the Standing Rock Indian Reservation depending on whether water areas are counted.) Reservation headquarters are in Crow Agency. The Crow Tribe of Indians of the State of Montana has an enrolled tribal membership of approximately 11,000, of whom 7,900 reside on the Crow Indian Reservation. Eighty-five percent speak Crow as their first language. The Crow Indian Reservation, the largest of the seven Indian reservations in Montana, is located in south-central Montana, bordered by Wyoming to the south and the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation to the east. The reservation encompasses approximately ,Lopard, James J., Margery Hunter Brown and Richmond L. Clow: Tribal Government Today. Politics on Montana Indian Reservations.

The value of the enormous amount of coal hidden under the surface in the old tribal territory became clear to the reservation Crows after the Arab Oil Embargo in the 1970s.Poten, Constance J.: Robert Yellowtail, the New Warrior. Montana, The Magazine of the West, Vol. 39 (Summer 1989), pp. 36–41, p. 40–41. The Crow Nation owns 1.4 billion tons of coal, enough to match the total supply in the United States for a year. The reservation's Absaloka coal mine provides half of the tribe's nonfederal budget. The single-pit mine opened in 1974 and employs 170 people. The decline of coal mining in the United States has forced the tribe to lay off 1,000 of its 1,300 employees. Every tribal citizen receives a $225 coal payment every four months. Half of the reservation's adult population is unemployed. In 2013, the tribe and Cloud Peak Energy agreed to open the Big Metal mine, which would have brought the company $10 million in revenue over the first five years. President Barack Obama blocked the mine and then imposed a moratorium on any new coal leasing on public lands. In March 2017, the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation sued Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to stop his attempt to lift the moratorium.

It was built during the 1930s for Juan Eugenio Serrallés, son of businessman Juan Serrallés, founder of Destilería Serrallés. The structure sits on a exceedingly manicured property.. Nowadays, the structure functions as a museum, Museo Castillo Serrallés, with information about the sugar cane and rum industries and its impact in the economy of Puerto Rico. It is also increasingly used as a venue for social activities, including destination weddings.Buscan eventos especiales para el Castillo. Sandra Torres Guzmán. La Perla del Sur. Ponce, Puerto Rico.

The Museum of Puerto Rican Music was eventually established elsewhere in the city. The mansion was emptied in 1956, and while the structure kept in very good shape, the grounds were overgrown by weeds to the point that a total landscaping plan was needed to return the estate to its past glory. In 1980, the property was still owned by Rosa Serrallés Torruella and Felix J. Serrallés Sanchez. Location The mansion was built on the south side of Cerro del Vigía (Del Vigía hill), which is the most prominent and nearest hill to the Ponce Historic Zone. Its location has the mansion overlooking the city of Ponce. Cerro del Vigía is the name of one of the hills to the north of the city of Ponce that make up the foothills of the Cordillera Central found further inland. The location of the mansion, together with its magnificent landscape, and many architectural details, have made it unique among other Puerto Rico mansions. Its location atop the Cerro del Vigía hill makes it visible from nearly every part of the city of Ponce, \\"as a constant reminder to all Ponceños of their heritage\\". The building's location, coupled with its \\"Y\\" shape form, allows for an impressive and breath-taking view of the city of Ponce from any one of its eastern, southern, or western elevations. Significance The Serrallés mansion was built as the exclusive residence of Don Juan Eugenio Serrallés, a leader in the sugar cane industry during the early part of the 20th century. The building is significant from both the architectural and historical perspectives. Architecturally, the building represents an example of Spanish Moroccan architecture, the style first introduced in Puerto Rico by the architect Pedro Adolfo de Castro. Three examples of this style of architecture were: El Castillo de Valdes in Mayagüez, el Castillo de Mario Mercado Montalvo in Guayanilla, and el Castillo de Serrallés. In the 1920s, other similar mansions were built in Puerto Rico, but Castillo Serrallés is the best preserved. Historically, the building is a reminder of the cultural and economic changes that southern Puerto Rico experienced in the 1920s. \\"Ponce's dependence on the sugar cane industry at the close of the nineteenth century, created an atmosphere of development from which evolved a series of intrinsic cultural characteristics and afforded great wealth to many families involved in the industry. The wealthy families generally chose Europe as the model for the direction that cultural endeavors would take.\\" According to the Puerto Rico State Historic Preservation Office, \\"European fashions and lifestyles were usually preferred in this part of the Island...The result of [the] intense cultural interest [of the time] provided work for artists, artisans, and architects whose creations tended to strengthen the image of the ethnic identity...Even though El Castillo Serralles is not based on an indigenous design, its architectural significance lies in the fact that it was designed to adapt well with Caribbean climatic conditions. Its workmanship, its interior decorations, its furniture, and even its floor plan, reflect the cultural attitudes of the times\\". Physical characteristics The castle was built in 1930 by local architect Pedro Adolfo de Castro y Besosa. It includes two huge terraces, an outside fountain, and a symmetrical backyard garden. Its interior includes a luxurious hall, a spacious dining room, and an interior courtyard. The house has four floors. The ground floor houses the garage and a basement used as service quarters. The second floor contains the library, a central patio, a solarium, the living room, dining room, and the kitchen. The third floor contains all the sleeping quarters. The fourth floor is the terrace, from where the most impressive and commanding views of the city are possible. Intended as a relaxed entertainment space, the terrace has both covered and uncovered areas. Its flooring is all tiled. Access to the main entrance to the house from the front street, and leading to the second level of the north elevation, is by way of either of two semi-circular stairways which run from the covered carriage entrance on the ground level of the north elevation. This leads to double French doors which open into a large vestibule reception area with a ceramic tile floor. The view from this room reveals an open courtyard patio with a fountain. The formal living room is located to the left of the vestibule. The living room is the only room with a parquet floor. The building was constructed entirely of concrete. The mansion was designed in a style popular in the 1920s for representing Spanish Mediterranean influence. Prominent throughout the building is the use of wooden round arches over the building's large windows and doorways, many of them adorned with small stained glass panes. Some openings are also decorated in ornate iron work. The two towers that accentuate the building's eastern and western sides have red roof tiles. This accent is also present on all other rooftops. The exterior of the buildings is finished in stucco. In the movies Scenes from the Disney Channel original movie Princess Protection Program were filmed in the castle.Patronato Castillo Serrallés.

By the late 1940s the entire company had rebranded under the Colonial Stores name. The Big Star name was revived around 1968 for a new discount chain owned by Colonial; eventually all stores were closed or converted to the Big Star name. Grand Union purchased the chain in 1978. The North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia stores were sold to Harris Teeter in 1988, while the Georgia stores were sold in 1992, with most of the Atlanta locations going to A&P.; These stores were heavily remodeled, but eventually sold to Publix in 1999.

It replaced the Bishopric of Halberstadt after its secularization in 1648. Its capital was Halberstadt. In 1807, the principality was made a state or regional capital of the Kingdom of Westphalia. In 1813, control of the principality was restored, and its sovereign rights were confirmed as the possession of the Kingdom of Prussia. History According to the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, the former prince-bishopric was secularized as the Principality of Halberstadt and together with Magdeburg, Minden and Cammin given to the Brandenburg Elector Frederick William I of Hohenzollern as a compensation for Western Pomerania, which in the aftermath of the Brandenburg-Pomeranian conflict he had to cede to Sweden. This agreement was negotiated by Frederick William's representative Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal, who in reward was appointed Halberstadt's first secular governor. Halberstadt, Dompropstei The newly created Principality of Halberstadt consisted of the territory around the historic towns of Osterwieck and Halberstadt, the former Principality of Anhalt-Aschersleben, the former County of Regenstein including Heimburg Castle and the County of Falkenstein. The Lordship of Derenburg was added in 1701, Hasserode acquired from Stolberg- Wernigerode in 1714 and after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Principality of Halberstadt obtained the Barony of Schauen and the Lordship of Hessenrode. Lost territories included Weferlingen, which King Frederick I in 1703 ceded to his cousin Christian Heinrich of Brandenburg-Bayreuth-Kulmbach, a subdivision of the County of Hohenstein about the same time and Stapelburg left to Stolberg-Wernigerode in 1727. The Principality of Halberstadt was dissolved according to the 1807 Treaty of Tilsit following Prussia's defeat in the War of the Fourth Coalition. Its territory became part of the Kingdom of Westphalia, a Napoleonic client-state under his younger brother Jérôme. After the French final defeat at Waterloo, the principality was restored to Prussia in 1813 and incorporated into the new Province of Saxony in 1817. Prussian monarchs of the House of Hohenzollern continued to style themselves as \\"Princes of [...] Halberstadt\\" until 1918.

Endorsing his art of poetry, the veteran Pakistani fiction writer Intizar Hussain commented that Izharul Haq is equally well-versed in the ghazal as well as in free verse. In both forms, he has been able to devise a diction, which distinguishes his verse from those of his contemporaries.Review by Intizar Hussain He is one of those prominent poets of the 1970s who revisited the tradition and blended it with Islamic and historical metaphors in order to define their own individuality. He has been termed an established poet with a unique diction and ideological stance.Interview: 'Poetic career is a voyage'Poets discuss contemporary Pakistani poetry and society Yasmeen Hameed in her review published in DAWN notes that Izhar ul Haq's style is distinctly modernistic and he is considered a trend setter in modern Urdu ghazal.

He found $8,000 worth of gold ($179,000 in 2020 dollars), and eventually the country's first gold vein in quartz. Newspapers in 24 states reported the find, and North Carolina's gold rush began. Meanwhile, Barringer was sued because of uncertainty over whether he owned the land he mined; he won the case in the 1880s. By 1888, new owners were working the mine and they moved Long Creek. In 1903, the Whitney Company, which was also working on damming the Yadkin River, bought the mine. Workers removed six tons of ore worth $20,000 per ton ($640,000 in 2020) and much more was still available. The gold financed the Yadkin River project. However, on August 11, 1904, a flood caused the deaths of eight men in the mine, and it eventually shut down, not to reopen until 1998. Incorporation resulted June 26, 2003 from a bill passed by the North Carolina General Assembly.Beth McLain, \\"Misenheimer wants county's help with zoning ordinance enforcement,\\" The Weekly Post, September 24, 2003, p. 14. A major reason for the action was the planned widening of U.S. 52 and N.C. 49, expected to bring growth to the area.Beth McLain, \\"Welcome to the Village of Misenheimer,\\" The Weekly Post, July 2, 2003, p. 1. One of the first actions taken by the interim board was to block heavy industry such as re- opening the former Barringer gold mine by Joe Carter, who owned about 250 acres, or about a fourth of the village land,Jenny Darby Roberson, \\"Zoning causes upset,\\" Stanly News and Press, August 24, 2003, p. 1A. but did not live in the community. Carter had been working to restart the mine since 1998, and county commissioners stopped his plan for a quarry after residents protested, but Peter Edquist, a leader of the incorporation effort and the first mayor, denied that the mine was the reason for incorporation.Jenny Darby Roberson, \\"Village approval gets closer,\\" Stanly News and Press, July 26, 2003, p. 1A.Shannon Beamon, \\"Residents look back at 10 years in the village,\\" Stanly News and Press, September 15, 2013, p. 1A. Government Misenheimer has a mayor-council government with five total council members serving staggered four-year terms. The council elects one of its own members as the mayor every two years, and may remove and replace the mayor as well. This system prevents the direct general election of a mayor by the citizens of the town. Members are elected at-large (without districts) and in a non-partisan manner. The local legislation creating the city specified that elections were to be held in even-numbered years, while the rest of the state always uses odd-numbered ones.

Hillside is one of seven high schools in the Durham Public Schools system. Of more than 300 historically black high schools that once operated in the state before desegregation, only five remain today, with Hillside being the oldest. Hillside is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. History The largest black schools in Durham prior to the building of Whitted School in 1887 were the Ledger Public School in Hayti, under the supervision of Miss Ledger, and the Hack Road Public School, where James Whitted was superintendent. In 1887, the Whitted School existed as the James A. Whitted High School, in honor of its first principal. The school, which was located on the corner of Blackwell and Pettigrew Streets, burned in 1888 and was located in a Bull Factory warehouse. In 1890, 161 pupils attended the school's six grades. Whitted taught the upper grades, William G. Pearson taught the middle grades, and two female teachers taught the first and second grades. The first class graduated from the ninth grade of Whitted school in 1896. Also in 1896, a permanent brick building was constructed on Proctor and Ramsey Street for black children at a cost of $8000. In 1899, the building was destroyed and reconstructed, but students were housed in churches during that school year. In 1901, another black school, West End, was built. At this time 707 students were enrolled in the Durham black graded schools. In 1909, the East End School was constructed. Only nine grades existed at Whitted from 1896 until 1911, but in 1911 a tenth grade was added. The 11th grade was added in 1918. From 1919 until 1920, first graders were housed in \\"dog houses,\\" which were temporary shacks near the brick school building. The Whitted School, which was in poor condition, burned in 1921, and students had to attend double sessions at East End and West End Schools. John Sprunt Hill, a leading Durham citizen, donated land for a new building on Pine and Umstead Street, which was named Hillside Park High School in honor of the donor and due to the fact that the school was located next to Hillside Park, a public city owned black park. The class of 1944 was the first to graduate under the 12 year system. A public address system was installed in the school in 1943 at a cost of $150. The \\"Park\\" was dropped from the name Hillside High School in 1943. In 1950, because of overcrowding in the high school, the Hillside High School students moved into what was then called Whitted Junior High School, located near the campus of North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and now the site of an NCCU science classroom building, and the Whitted Junior High School students moved into the old Hillside Park High School building closer to downtown Durham. The schools buildings also swapped names. Hillside High School at this time only enrolled grades 10, 11 and 12 and Whitted Junior High School enrolled 7, 8 and 9. Additions of an auditorium, cafeteria, auto shop, classroom and gymnasium were made to accommodate the large number of transferred high school students in 1949. A classroom annex was added to the Hillside building in 1962. In 1966 a new library was added. A new band room was constructed in 1975. Hillside was relocated to a new building in 1995. Eunice Sanders was Hillside's principal from 2002-2006, resigning after the 2005-06 school year to move to an administrative position within the Durham Public Schools Central Office. Earl Pappy was the principal of Hillside from 2006-2009. He was followed by Hans Lassiter who served as principal from 2009-2012\\\\. The current Principal is William Logan. Programs Hillside offers the International Baccalaureate and AVID programs to academically gifted students. This school offers career pathways in engineering and cosmetology. They also offer many Advanced Placement classes. Hillside High recently created a freshmen academy to help incoming freshmen matriculate and excel in their academics.

All the works feature one or more characters, typically Piers, from William Langland's poem Piers Plowman. (A much larger number of texts, with less obvious connection to Piers Plowman, may also be considered part of the tradition.) Because the Plowman appears in the General Prologue to The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer but does not have his own tale (one of seven such characters), plowman tales are sometimes used as additions to The Canterbury Tales, or otherwise conflated or associated with Chaucer. As a rule, they satirically reflect economic, social, political, and religious grievances, and are concerned with political decisions and the relation between commoners and king. In these respects they resemble works such as Poem on the Evil Times of Edward II (1321–27), The Song of the Husbandman (c. 1340), Wynnere and Wastoure (c. 1353), and The Parlement of the Three Ages (c. 1375-1400). The Piers Plowman tradition therefore contributed to an emerging early modern \\"public sphere\\". Most of the works of the tradition are anonymous; many are pseudepigraphic by authorial design or later misattribution. The distinction between fiction and history in them is often blurred. 14th and 15th centuries (Unless otherwise noted, dates given here refer to the year when the work was first written.) Along with the writings of John Ball, the earliest contributions to the Piers Plowman tradition are extensively associated with the Lollards: *Pierce the Ploughman's Crede, an anonymous, Lollard, alliterative, anticlerical, satirical poem written c. 1395 and printed in 1553 and 1561. *The Plowman's Tale, also known as The Complaynte of the Ploughman, a Lollard poem written c. 1400 and printed by itself about 1533-1536 and again about 1548. *The Praier and Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe, a Lollard prose tract and prayer for reform written about 1400, with some sources putting it as early as 1350 or as late as 1450, was printed twice, in about 1531 and 1532. *Richard the Redeless and Mum and the Sothsegger, both written about 1405, are usually thought to be by the same author and perhaps two parts of a single work. W. W. Skeat attributed them to Langland himself. *The Crowned King (1415) Less directly and self-consciously evocative of Piers Plowman are: *Jack Upland, a Lollard satire written about 1389-1396 *Responsiones ad Questiones LXV and Friar Daw's Reply, two anti-Lollard retorts to Jack Upland *Upland's Rejoinder, a Lollard retort to Friar Daw's Reply *I-blessyd Be Cristes Sonde, sometimes wrongly referred to as God Speed the Plough 16th and 17th centuries :(Note: Unless otherwise noted, dates given here refer to the year when the work was first printed.) Many of the previously mentioned plowman texts, which first circulated in manuscript, reappeared later in print, often with some degree of intentional alteration and editorializing that aimed at construing them as proto-Protestant . This is true also of the first printed editions of Piers Plowman in 1550 and 1561 by Robert Crowley and Owen Rogers. William Tyndale may have (and was thought by some contemporaries) to have supplied the preface to the printed edition of the Praier and Complaynte, which aroused the critical pen of Thomas More. John Foxe did his part to canonize the same text in four editions of his famous Actes and Monuments from 1570 to 1610. Like Jack Upland, The Plowman's Tale became associated with Geoffrey Chaucer and was added by various editors to four editions of Chaucer's collected works between 1542 and 1602. I Playne Piers which Cannot Flatter, a mixture of parts of The Plowman's Tale and new material added some time after 1540, was printed in 1550 and ascribed to the author of Piers Plowman who was then unknown or identified as either Chaucer, John Wycliffe, or Robert Langland. I Playne Piers was reprinted by the Puritan Martinist writers in the Martin Marprelate Controversy in 1589. It was then retitled, O read me, for I am of great antiquitie . . . I am the Gransier of Martin Mare- prelitte. There were also many new texts produced in the sixteenth century that may be considered parts of the Piers Plowman tradition, such as Edmund Spenser's The Shepheardes Calendar which makes use of a character named \\"Piers\\" and consciously borrows lines from The Plowman's Tale. Spenser's character, Colin Clout, who appears in two of his poems, is also a Piers-like figure derived from John Skelton. John Bale regarded Skelton as a vates pierius - poetic prophet, with pierius perhaps alluding to Piers, the pre- eminent English prophet-poet. Bale was pleased with Skelton's attacks on the clergy and his open breach of clerical celibacy. Colin Clout (1521) is one of Skelton's anti-Wolsey satires where the title character, a vagabond, complains about corrupt churchmen. Sixteenth-century texts that refer to the poem Piers Plowman or the character \\"Piers Plowman\\" include: *The Banckett of Iohan the Reve unto Peirs Ploughman, Laurens laborer, Thomlyn tailer and Hobb of the hille with others (British Library MS Harley 207) was written c. 1532. In it, Jacke Jolie, a Protestant, quotes reformers, including Martin Luther, on the Eucharist. A Catholic Piers defends the Roman doctrine. *Jack of the North, an anti-enclosure dialogue written c. 1549. *A Godly Dyalogue and Dysputacyion Betwene Pyers Plowman and a Popysh Preest concernyng the supper of the lorde (c. 1550) *Thomas Churchyard’s The Contention...upon David Dycers Dreame (c. 1551-52) *Possibly by Robert Crowley, Pyers Plowmans Exhortation unto the Lordes, Knightes, and Burgoysses of the Parlyamenthouse (c. 1550) *George Gascoigne, The Fruites of Warre (1575) and The Steel Glas (1576), uses but complicates the tradition. Piers becomes an ambivalent figure capable of self- interest and vice; he is no longer a pure, idealized character. Gascoigne satirizes corrupt clergy and elites as well as the \\"innocent\\" plowman types whose complaints are motivated by the same self-interest. Rampant individualism transcends all social divisions. *Possibly by Francis Thynne, Newes from the North Otherwise called the Conference between Simon Certain and Pierce Plowman (1579) *Possibly by William Kempe and Edward Alleyn, A Merry Knack to Know a Knave (1594), a late Elizabethan morality play in which Piers Plowman is introduced by Honesty and complains to the king about unjust landlords. When it was performed on 11 June 1592, a riot broke out in the audience; this led to the City Council's order that all theatres be closed until September. Another play, A knack to know an honest man (1596) is probably a response; it involves shepherds and was printed by John Danter, Thomas Nashe's printer. Less directly associated with Piers are: *God Spede the Plough *A Lytell Geste how the Plowman lerned his Pater Noster (c. 1510), printed by Wynkyn de Worde and in circulation as late as 1560 and 1582. In it a Catholic priest is the figure of right religion while the plowman is an avaricious ignoramus. Perhaps broad sympathy for this point of view explains why Piers Plowman was not printed until 1550. *Of Gentylnes and Nobylyte: A dyaloge betwene the marchaunt the knyght and the plowman dysputyng who is a verey gentylman and who is a noble man and how men shuld come to auctoryte, compiled in a maner of an enterlude, or the Dialogue of the Gentleman and Plowman... (1525). This is a dramatic work that is often mistitled as the Dialogue of the Gentleman and Plowman. Its printer, John Rastell, or John Heywood may have been the author. In the dialogue, the plowman takes over and wins the debate, arguing for individual merit based on inner virtue.

Reprinted in 1583 as De Republica Anglorum: A Discourse on the Commonwealth of England. Attributed to Sir Thomas Smith as well as William Stafford and John Hales. It discusses history and economic conditions under Edward VI. Depicts a complaining farmer/husbandman in a dialogue with a doctor who tells him to rethink his old-fashioned ideas about the agricultural economy. Outlines English social hierarchy: 1) gentlemen, 2) citizens and burgesses, 3) yeomen, 4) the fourth sort of people who do not rule. Affirms orthodox opinion that it is not for the commons to discuss or influence public matters and policy; they are politically disenfranchied within a paternalistic system which is nevertheless undercut by acknowledgment of their power even as it is denied. The common yeoman is identified as distinct from the rogue; it is the yeoman who forms the basis of English society and economy. Yet he is not to be compared to gentlemen on the basis of wit, conduct or power. The Yeomen are numerous, obedient, strong, able to endure hardship, and courageous. (I.e., they make excellent, loyal, patriotic conscripts.) *An Almanac for 1582 predicts the commons will be \\"factious...quarrelous, impatient, and outragious, one envying the estate and degree of another: as the poor the rich, the ploughman the gentleman.\\" *John Harvey, A Discorsive Problem concerning the Prophecies, How far they are to be valued, or credited, according to the surest rules, and directions in Divinitie, Philosophie, Astrologie and other learning (1588) states, \\"For how easily might I heer repeate almost infinite examples of villainous attempts, pernitious uprores, horrible mischeefes, slaughters, blasphemies, heresies, and all other indignities, and outrages, desperately committed, and perpetrated through means of such inveterate, and new broched forgeries. . . . neither shal I therefore neede to ransacke Pierce Plowmans satchell; nor to descant upon fortunes, newly collected out of the old Shepherds Kalendar...\\" *Richard Harvey, Plaine Percevall the Peace-Maker of England (1590), an unsophisticated man of common-sense, Percevall attacks all the anti-Martinists but purports to settle the controversy. *Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, books 1-3 (1590) In the first book, the Redcross knight's origins are rich with multiple meanings: as a national symbol, he is St. George, England's patron saint, and Spenser stresses the humble, agricultural origins of the name George (Georgos is Greek for \\"farmer\\"). On a more individualized level, Redcrosse represents a radical social mobility, going from the plow to the queen's court. Spenser is no doubt expressing a kind of personal allegory that would resonate with other ambitious men with humble origins, but such mobility also threatens the agrarian order by eroding the fixity of the social hierarchy upheld by the earlier, conservative agrarian complaints: > Thence she thee brought into this faerie Lond, And in an heaped furrow did > thee hyde, Where thee a Ploughman all unweeting fond, As he his toylsome > teme that way did guyde, And brought thee up in ploughmans state to byde, > Whereof Georgos he thee gave to name; Till prickt with courage, and thy > forces pryde, To Faery court thou cam'st to seeke for fame, And prove thy > puissant armes, as seemes thee best became. *Robert Greene, A Quip for an Upstart Courtier (1592), the basis for a lost play performed by The Chamberlain's Men, Clothbreeches and Velvethose (1600). *Thomas Nashe, Pierce Pennilesse His Supplication to the Devil (1592) *Gabriel Harvey, Pierce's Supererogation (1593), a response to Nashe's attacks on Harvey and his brothers. *Robert Wilson The Cobler's Prophecy (1594), a play. *Pedler's Prophecie (1595), a play. *Henry Chettle, Piers Plainnes seaven yeres Prentiship In Arcadia, a picaro Piers talks about his life (much of it spent in London) to Arcadian shepherds in Tempe. He has served as an apprentice under seven bad masters (an occasion for another taxonomy of London life and vices). Giving up on the court as an exception to general corruption, Chettle's Piers follows the precedent from Virgil to Wyatt and Spenser: satisfaction will only be found in pastoral retirement. Like much other late Elizabethan prose, John Lyly's Euphues is an obvious source of inspiration. The influence of other masterpieces of rogue literature is apparent, especially Nashe's Pierce Pennilesse and The Unfortunate Traveller. Like Thomas More and Robert Crowley, Bishop Hugh Latimer valued \\"commune wealth\\" more than \\"private commodity.\\" He was an outspoken critic of enclosure, the abuses of landlords, and the aristocrats who lined their pockets through the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Like Crowley, Latimer was able to be especially outspoken when Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset had controlling influence in the court as Lord Protector of England during part of the minority of Edward VI. A famous sermon of Latimer's that represented preachers as God's plowmen, \\"The Sermon of the Plowers,\\" was delivered at St. Paul's Cross, 18 January 1548 and was printed that year by John Day. This was the last of four \\"Sermons on the Plough;\\" unfortunately the first three are lost. While Latimer's message is spiritual, it has a sharp political edge that also acknowledges the material concerns of people affected by enclosure. Latimer attacks idle clergy as \\"plowmen\\" who cause a spiritual famine, and enclosure is used as a metaphor for hindrances to proper preaching. The devil is called the busiest bishop and greatest plowman in England; he is seeding the land with the ritual and ornamental trappings of popery. Latimer himself, through the style of his sermons, typifies the plain, homely and direct speech of Piers and popular Protestantism. Anthony Anderson's The Shield of our Safetie (1581) uses Latimer's figure of the pastor as a plowman but is unwilling to ascribe special virtue to the commons and rural laborers. Godliness is lacking \\"from top to toe\\" in England, \\"from the Nobilitie, to the Plowman and his mate.\\" George Gifford's A Briefe Discourse of Certaine Points of the Religion which is among the Common Sort of Christians (1583) asserts that \\"it is not for plowmen to meddle with scriptures.\\" Trends and influences The early modern dissemination and reception of Visio Willelmi de Petro Ploughman (\\"William's Vision of Piers Plowman\\") from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century reveals a great deal about changes in English society and politics. Clearly orthodox Roman Catholic in doctrine but reformist in that it posed social criticism and advocated moral, economic, and political change, the original poem(s)--and the figure of Piers in the popular imagination--were often viewed quite differently. Piers was open to being appropriated by Lollards and later Protestant reformers. William Tyndale's memorable statement to a \\"popish priest,\\" recorded in John Foxe' Acts and Monuments, is an echo of Erasmus' Paraclesis, which also resonated with popular images of the pious plowman: \\"If God spare my life ere many years, I will cause a boy that driveth the plow shall know more of the scripture than thou dost.\\" After nearly two centuries, the plowman tradition of social complaint and satire became more worldly-wise and less ardently idealistic. It became, increasingly, a secular vehicle for complaining about class rivalries and political dissent--and also for containing or restraining such things. What is notable about the Piers/plowman literature of the Elizabethan era is the general absence of the old religious radical who speaks the plain truth for the poor, godly commons against corrupt elites and hypocritical English clergy. In many cases the name of Piers remained, but his vocation was altered; with few exceptions, he was no longer specifically a religious reformer. Criticism of the wealthy and powerful continued, but rather than directly addressing complaints to them and to the mnonarch and parliament as Edwardians like Crowley, Latimer and Thomas Lever had done, they became the subject of comic, often satiric, popular entertainment. Plays and pamphlets became the vehicle of social analysis, concerned with class identities and rivalries that were rendered with greater complexity and detail than in found in the earlier literature. After the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, the Piers tradition changed, particularly after censorship laws put into effect in 1551, 1553, and 1559, officially banned discussion of religious matters or matters of state. Other causes were also at work. With the division and collapse of Christendom in the Reformation, the medieval conception of the social hierarchy, as well as Purgatory and Hell, so central to Langland's poem, were vestigial remnants of a passing order. In the Elizabethan era, Piers' Christological aspect became fully detached from his role as the universal commoner, a secular economic man among economic men with clashing interests. At the same time, there was a bifurcation of the original carnivalesque world of Langland's Piers that had common, aristocratic, and divine characters. The moral and apocalyptic aspects of Piers flourished briefly at mid-century but then dissipated along with the idealism of the Edwardian reformers and their vision of a united commonwealth of interdependent estates. Popular literature evoking Piers by name or in spirit began to construe elites as people with whom one may compete and win. Langland's \\"fair field of folk\\" became a socioeconomic playing field on which elites are perhaps no less important to the nation than the common people. In this way Langland's Piers and Piers-like figures helped establish an English national identity based on and for the popular rather than the elite culture. This popular self-understanding seems to have flourished especially in the nonconformist Puritan mind where it could be radicalized. In other cases, it could be a basis for statist nationalism According to the Privy Council, military conscription, which was at a high in the late sixteenth century, gave \\"great ease and good to the country to be ridd of those kinde of people whoe otherwyse wil be a burthen to the country.\\" Such attempts to channel and appropriate the power of the commoners did not escape their notice. In Pierce Pennilesse, Thomas Nashe wrote, \\"If they have no service abroad, they will make mutinies at home...\\" Popular awareness of such strategies to channel the power of the commons toward royal interests did not generate resistance, but offered a chance for the commons to insert their own interests into the transaction. Perhaps this is why in the Elizabethan era, Piers and Piers-like figures began to appear as itinerant laborers and tradesmen: tinkers, coblers and shoemakers who claimed to represent true Englishness over against effete, pretentious elites. While affirming their loyalty, these humble figures labored to define an English identity from below that was drawn from native, popular traditions going back to Langland and Chaucer. To the extent that the popular opposition between plain and ornate, honest and dissembling was associated with courtiers, (South European) foreignness and Catholicism, the plowman tradition continued to be anti-Catholic and staunchly Protestant. This popular image of the English commonwealth is often defined in the Elizabethan era in opposition to Catholic nations and \\"Rome,\\" which are represented as less free and unvirtuous. Hutchins notes that \\"Even in the most unremittingly absolutist interpretations of Tudor theories of rule, the qualities that Elizabethans claim make a good ruler include dignified concern for the common people\\" (229). Popular plowman literature constantly reasserts this view: English society is based on its regard for its foundation in the commons. As a sturdy working-class fellow in the popular culture, it is not surprising that Piers never made it into the works of the elite writers who predominate in the English literary canon. Moreover, Piers was even more archaic and parochial than Chaucer, with the added notoriety of political subversiveness and (now illegal) prophecy. University educated, aspiring courtier-writers with poorer, often rural, backgrounds (e.g., Spenser and Harvey) may have been uneasy with a tradition that sometimes cast a cold eye on the lives and ambitions of upwardly mobile urbanites like themselves. In Nashe we find a new Piers, Pierce Pennilesse, who represents the young London malcontent writer who desires but lacks patronage and recognition of his talent. While this literature is far removed from the straightforward religious and political criticisms of Crowley and others, writers like Nashe and Greene were still finding ways to use the old moral-satirical tradition to expose and attack--or just laugh at--vices directly related to contemporary social and political conditions.

He played 72 games for the Saints between 1978 and 1983 before briefly moving to North Melbourne in 1984, and finishing his career at Fitzroy in 1985. Following his retirement from the VFL at the end of 1985, in 1986 he moved to become the playing coach of Warrnambool in the Hampden Football League. He won four premierships with the club in just five seasons until 1990.  Post-playing career  After his retirement from playing, Thomas coached Old Xaverians in the VAFA in 1992 and was the chairman of selectors at the North Melbourne Football Club in 1993 under Denis Pagan. In 1994 he was an assistant coach at St Kilda under Stan Alves before moving on to pursue various business ventures. =St Kilda Football Club coach= With his experience in the business world, Thomas took a new philosophy to the St Kilda Football Club when he was appointed caretaker coach of the club in 2001 after the controversial mid-season sacking of Malcolm Blight. Thomas was then appointed as full-time coach. Thomas had a focus on 'man-management' in his coaching style, as well as conducting practices on the running of the club that are common in the business world. This new style of coaching was characterised by Thomas's occasional use of jargon such as \\"processes\\" and \\"outcomes\\" – although they are now terms almost universally used by all coaches. Thomas coached St Kilda to consecutive preliminary finals in 2004 and 2005 plus a Wizard Cup premiership in 2004. While he initially came under fire for refusing to use the 'flood', Thomas slowly started to integrate the defensive style into his match-day approach with improved results. Despite the criticism, Thomas maintained an impressive win-loss record against some of league's most highly rated coaches, including Malthouse, Pagan, Eade, Matthews, Wallace and Craig. Thomas once said in an interview about the St Kilda Football Club: \\"This club is what I'm about.\\" Thomas is only one of three coaches to coach St Kilda to three straight finals series. The others being Ross Lyon and Allan Jeans, St Kilda's 1966 premiership coach. Sacking After many injuries during the 2006 season, St Kilda finished sixth after the home and away season but were beaten in the elimination final by Melbourne. Injuries to Fraser Gehrig, Robert Harvey, Justin Koschitzke, Raphael Clarke and Xavier Clarke during the game, as well as the underdone Aaron Hamill and Max Hudghton, led to the Saints exiting the finals after leading for most of the match but being unable to run the game out. They finished the season in eighth position, which was not considered good enough by the club's president, Rod Butterss. On 12 September 2006 it was announced that Thomas would no longer coach the club as a 'mutual' agreement. Thomas, however, maintained that the club had asked him to leave by sacking him and while he had accepted, it was not completely mutual. The decision was a shock to the football world considering that Thomas was only the second coach to lead the Saints to three consecutive finals series. It is not known why he was sacked, but many factors include the controversial match against Fremantle in Round 5, 2006 in which the Saints were stripped of two points following a hearing the following Wednesday, which ultimately cost them a top- four spot and the double chance, the long-term injuries to Justin Koschitzke, Aaron Hamill and Fergus Watts and starting the season with two interstate trips in four weeks. Thomas has shown no interest in ever coaching another AFL club. Post-coaching career In 2007, Thomas was hired as a columnist for The Age and his columns appeared every Sunday until he was sacked on 19 July 2008 after an argument with the chief of football, Caroline Wilson, because Thomas had accused Wilson of being a liar on radio station SEN 1116. This led to Thomas losing his job at the paper. He then joined Melbourne sports station SEN 1116 as an expert commentator, until he was sacked by SEN on Monday 11 May 2009. The AFL denied that they played any part in the decision. Until 2012, he was also a weekly panellist on Footy Classified, alongside Wilson, Garry Lyon and Craig Hutchison. =Digital media= In Feb 2018, Thomas founded and launched the podcast \\"Sam, Mike & Thomo\\". Together with media personality Sam Newman and decorated media journalist and TV personality Mike Sheehan, Thomas releases a weekly podcast on a wide range of global and domestic topics and current events, with a sprinkling of AFL sport comments and opinions. Personal life Thomas has 8 children, 4 boys and 4 girls. Thomas has been married to Kerry Thomas since 1984. His son Tyson played senior football for the Northern Blues in the VFL.

The Prithviraj Raso was embellished with time and quite a few authors added to it. Only parts of the original manuscript are still intact.

The British were led by Sir Hugh Gough, while the Sikhs were led by Sher Singh Attariwalla. The Sikhs repelled an attempted British surprise attack. Background Following the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo- Sikh War, British Commissioners and Political Agents had effectively ruled the Punjab, using the Sikh Khalsa Army to maintain order and implement British policy. There was much unrest over this arrangement and the other galling terms of the peace treaty, not least within the Khalsa which believed it had been betrayed rather than defeated in the first war. The second war broke out in April 1848, when a popular uprising in the city of Multan forced its ruler, Dewan Mulraj, into rebellion. The British Governor-General of Bengal, Lord Dalhousie, initially ordered only a small contingent of the Bengal Army under General Whish to suppress the outbreak (partly for reasons of economy, and partly to avoid a major campaign during the Hot Weather and Monsoon seasons). He also ordered several detachments of the Khalsa to reinforce Whish. The largest detachment, of 3,300 cavalry and 900 infantry was commanded by Sardar (General) Sher Singh Attariwalla. Several junior Political Agents viewed this development with alarm, as Sher Singh's father, Chattar Singh Attariwalla, the Governor of Hazara to the north of the Punjab, was openly plotting rebellion. On 14 September, Sher Singh rebelled. Whish was forced to raise the siege of Multan and retire. Nevertheless, Sher Singh and Mulraj (the Hindu ruler of a largely Moslem city-state) did not join forces. The two leaders conferred at a temple outside the city, where both prayed and it was agreed that Mulraj would supply some funds from his treasury, while Sher Singh moved north to join his forces with those of his father. This was not immediately possible, as Chattar Singh's army was confined to Hazara by Moslem tribesmen fighting under British officers. Instead, Sher Singh moved a few miles north and began fortifying the crossings of the Chenab River, while awaiting developments. His army was swelled by deserters from those regiments of the Khalsa which had not yet rebelled, and by discharged former soldiers. Battle Map of the battle By November, the British had at last assembled a large army on the frontier of the Punjab, under the Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Hugh Gough. Gough had been criticised for his unvarying frontal attacks during the First Anglo-Sikh War, which had led to heavy British casualties and some near disasters. In the early hours of the morning of 22 November, Gough ordered a force of cavalry and horse artillery, with a single infantry brigade, to move to the Chenab crossing near Ramnagar (present-day Rasool Nagar in Pakistan), apparently intending to capture the position by surprise. The Sikhs occupied strong positions on both banks of the river and on an island in mid-stream. The river was only a narrow stream, but the wide bed it occupied during the monsoon season was treacherous soft sand, in which cavalry and artillery could become bogged down. At dawn, the British force assembled opposite the fords. The 3rd Light Dragoons and 8th Bengal Light Cavalry drove some Sikhs back across the river from positions on the east bank. At this point, hitherto concealed Sikh batteries opened fire. The British cavalry had difficulty extricating themselves from the soft ground. Gough's horse artillery was outgunned and forced to retire, leaving behind a 6-pounder gun which had become bogged down. The brigade commander, Sir Colin Campbell, called up troops to retrieve the gun but was over-ruled by Gough.Greenwood, ch.5 Sher Singh sent 3,000 horsemen across the fords to take advantage of the British check. Gough ordered the main body of his cavalry (the 14th Light Dragoons and the 5th Bengal Light Cavalry) to attack them. These drove back the Sikh horsemen but as they pursued them down the river bank, they were hit by heavy artillery fire. The Sikh cavalry also turned about and hit the 5th Light Cavalry, causing heavy casualties. The Commanding Officer of the 14th Light Dragoons, Colonel William Havelock, led another charge, apparently without orders.Farwell, p.53 He and his leading troopers were surrounded and cut down. After a third charge failed, Brigadier Charles Robert Cureton, the commander of the cavalry division to which the troops belonged, galloped up and ordered a retreat. He himself was then killed by musket fire. Results Official British casualties, including Brigadier General Cureton, were 26 killed or missing, 59 wounded. This may have referred to the 14th Light Dragoons only. Sikh casualties were not recorded. Sher Singh had skillfully used every advantage of ground and preparation. Although the Sikh forces had been driven from their vulnerable positions on the east bank of the Chenab, their main positions were intact, they had undoubtedly repulsed a British attack, and the morale of Sher Singh's army was boosted. On the British side, several shortcomings were obvious. There had been little reconnaissance or other attempts to gain information on the Sikh dispositions. Gough and Havelock had both ordered foolish or reckless charges. Cureton had a reputation from the First Sikh War as a steady and capable officer, and ought to have been in command from the start.

Meeting at Coffee House, New York, 1915. The Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage was an American organization formed in 1913 led by Alice Paul and Lucy Burns to campaign for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing women's suffrage. It was inspired by the United Kingdom's suffragette movement, which Paul and Burns had taken part in. Their continuous campaigning drew attention from congressmen, and in 1914 they were successful in forcing the amendment onto the floor for the first time in decades. Early history Alice Paul created the Congressional Union after joining the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and gaining leadership of its Congressional Committee. The CU was initiated to assist the NAWSA Congressional Committee and its officers were part of that committee. The CU shared the same goal with NAWSA, to gain an amendment to the United States Constitution giving all women the right to vote. In the beginning, the CU worked within NAWSA to strengthen the declining Congressional Committee. In March 1913, after realizing the amount of work to be done, the CU became in charge of their own operations and funding but still remained affiliated with NAWSA. In the fall of 1913, Carrie Chapman Catt of NAWSA accused the CU of insubordination and financial irregularities, allegations which she later retracted. The strategies of the two organizations were conflicting and NAWSA's leadership felt threatened. In December 1913, the National American Woman Suffrage Association selected a new Congressional Committee and formally cut ties with the Congressional Union.  Initiative  The Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage appealed to young women with a new approach in the fight for women's suffrage, inspired by the British suffragettes. Alice Paul believed women should not have to beg for their rights. Paul introduced some of the militant methods used by the Women's Social and Political Union in Britain to the CU and its members. These included direct actions, organizing huge demonstrations, and the daily picketing of the White House. The CU had 4,500 members and had raised more than $50,000 in funds by 1914. Over time, the efforts of hundreds of members led to their arrest and sometimes imprisonment.  Organization  The Congressional Union's headquarters were located on F Street in Washington, D.C. near the Willard Hotel in a highly visible office which they paid for themselves. They started women's \\"suffrage schools\\" to spread awareness about their cause and held multiple meetings each day. The CU was never organized by states or districts, but there were different branches of the organization in a number of states. The Washington headquarters was central to their work but they were also a mobile organization. The CU published a newspaper called The Suffragist, featuring articles by prominent members including Alice Paul, Lucy Burns and Inez Milholland. The newspaper employed Nina Allender as its main cartoonist, and also published cartoons by artists such as Cornelia Barns, Boardman Robinson and Marietta Andrews.  Campaigning  The Congressional Union actively campaigned for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing universal woman suffrage. Following the methods used by suffragettes in Britain, the CU fully blamed the majority party for failure to advance the Federal Suffrage Amendment. The majority party at the time was the Democratic Party, and Democrat Woodrow Wilson was president. Members traveled west and campaigned against Democrats in hopes of impeding their reelection. They even campaigned against Democrats who approved women's suffrage, despite criticism from the National American Woman Suffrage Association. They traveled through the west by train while using a number of tactics to increase their visibility and their whistle-stop speeches attracted the attention of reporters. Their campaign resulted in the defeat of 20 democrats who supported suffrage, much to the dismay of NAWSA.  National Woman's Party  The Congressional Union created the National Woman's Party at a meeting in Chicago in 1916. The party included members of the Congressional Union, and Alice Paul was in charge. A Campaign Committee was formed within the party with Anne Martin serving as chairman. In 1917, the two organizations officially joined together to form the National Woman's Party (NWP) and elected Alice Paul as their chairman.

He is a utility player, and has played for Castleford as a full- back, centre, stand-off, scrum-half and loose forward. Background McGoldrick was born in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. Early career McGoldrick played junior volleyball for Wynnum Manly. He also played Rugby Union at the selective Brisbane State High School in Queensland. Rugby league career McGoldrick made his First Grade début for the Cronulla- Sutherland Sharks in Round 6 v Newcastle at Toyota Park, 19 April 2002. In 2004, McGoldrick returned to rugby league after a sting in rugby union signed with the Cronulla Sharks once again. In late 2005, Ryan was one of 12 of the hottest players in the NRL that posed for the League Of Their Own 2006 calendar that was produced in the style of the famous Dieux du Stade calendars to raise money for the Koori Kids foundation. In early 2006, Ryan was involved in a tug of war between SL club Castleford Tigers and NRL club Wests Tigers, with both clubs claiming to have agreed terms with McGoldrick. In the end, he arrived in Castleford a few days before their first match of the season. Ryan McGoldrick made his début for Castleford Tigers in 18-42 defeat by Hull on 10 February 2006. He, along with the rest of the squad, battled to keep Castleford in the top flight. Ryan suffered a hamstring injury towards the end of the 2006 season, but was forced to play due to lack of numbers. Unfortunately Castleford were relegated at the end of the season. Despite this, McGoldrick signed a 2-year contract to stay with the club until 2008. McGoldrick played for the Tigers during the 2007 season, and was initially used in his less-preferred position of stand-off, which seemed to unsettle him. However, as the season progressed, he managed to move into the centre role and began to show fantastic form as Castleford won promotion back to Super League. McGoldrick moved to full back for the 2008 season and showed good form, which led to him earning a new four-year contract at Castleford. McGoldrick was named captain of the side on occasion in 2009 following injuries to key players, and he has continued to play a utility role for the club. McGoldrick left the club after 7 years in July 2012 after handing in a transfer request. He joined Hull FC on a short-term deal until the end of the 2012 season. McGoldrick has signed for Salford City Reds for the 2013 Super League Campaign. On Tuesday 12 April 2016 McGoldrick attempted to sell himself on a per-game basis on eBay, the listing was removed when as eBay stated... \\"goes against their terms of selling body parts and remains\\". Rugby union career Changing football codes, Ryan represented the New South Wales Waratahs in rugby union during 2003. International career McGoldrick qualifies for the United States national rugby league team due to parentage. Ryan McGoldrick represented the United States making his début playing in the 0-70 defeat by Cumbria at Barrow's stadium on 4 November 2007, and scoring 1-try in the 10-42 defeat by Samoa at Widnes' stadium on 9 November 2007. He again represented USA in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup qualifying, where he featured in the victory over Jamaica that secured USA's spot at the tournament.

After a successful theatrical career, she became one of the first German movie stars. Life Sandrock was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, the daughter of the German merchant Eduard Sandrock (1834–1897) and his Dutch wife Johanna Simonetta ten Hagen (1833–1917). With sister Wilhelmine (1861-1948) and brother Christian (1862–1924) she grew up in Rotterdam and, after her parents divorced on 15 November 1869, in Berlin. There in 1878 at the age of fifteen she made her debut as Selma in Mutter und Sohn by Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer. In Berlin she met the famous Meiningen Ensemble and achieved success at the theatre of Meiningen, where her first role was Luise in Friedrich Schiller's Intrigue and Love, followed by further engagements in Moscow, Wiener Neustadt, and Budapest. In 1889 she had her breakthrough at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna and afterwards became a member of the Volkstheater ensemble. She created a number of major roles for modern playwrights including Henrik Ibsen and Arthur Schnitzler, with whom she had a notoriously stormy affair, later perpetuated in his play La Ronde. She was temporarily engaged with the author Alexander Roda Roda, who also integrated the experience in his writing. From 1895 she performed at the Burgtheater, however, she provoked disagreement concerning both her contract and her private life, and she left for an extended European tour in 1898. Back at the Volkstheater in 1902, she was not able to continue her success on the stage. In 1905 he moved back to Berlin, to work at the Deutsches Theater led by Max Reinhardt. Adele Sandrock about 1930 In 1911 Sandrock made her silent film debut in Marianne, ein Weib aus dem Volk, a short subject. She acted in more than 140 films, working with a number of directors including Reinhold Schünzel and Hans Hinrich, and even continued her career into the sound film era with her characteristic dark voice. Her autobiography, Mein Leben, was published in 1940.

It has no roads leading to it, but it is a popular tourist attraction, accessible by mountain bike or tramping on a variety of different tracks, or by boat or kayak, followed by a 45-minute (one way) walk along maintained bush trails. It was built across the deep Mangapurua Gorge to provide access to an area where the government was opening up land in 1917 for pioneering farmers, mainly soldiers who had returned from World War I. The intention was to build roads to it later, but the area proved to be so remote and unsuitable for farming that the venture failed and the farms reverted to native bush. A sign on the bridge states: :Started in January 1935 and completed in June 1936, this bridge was built by the Raetihi firm of Sandford and Brown, for the Public Works Department. It is 130 feet long, and 125 feet above the stream. The cost of labour was 598 pounds 11 shillings 7 pence, and cartage of all materials (via the Mangapurua Valley road) cost 419 pounds 14 shillings. Unfortunately the cost of materials was not recorded. Aggregate for the concrete is said to have been transported from the Rangitikei River. The completion of the bridge was delayed considerably due to floods, slips, and the consequent delay in the supply of materials. The bridge was built to facilitate vehicular access to the Wanganui River, to link the settlers of the valley with the riverboat service. In 1917 the Government opened up the valley for settlement by soldiers returning from World War I. Virgin forest was cleared, and a total of 35 holdings developed. A school was opened, and for some years the valley prospered. However economic hardship, and problems associated with the remoteness and difficulty of access, resulted in many families abandoning their farms. By 1942 there were only 3 families left. After a major flood in January 1942 the Government declined to make further funds available for road maintenance, and it officially closed the valley in May 1942. The disappearing road line, old fence lines, stands of exotic trees, occasional brick chimneys, and this bridge serve as reminders of the ill fated settlement of the Mangapurua valley. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"abundant stream\\" for Mangapūrua.

Williams High School, the flagship school of the Alamance-Burlington School System, is a high school (grades 9–12) in Burlington, North Carolina, United States. It was named in honor of philanthropist, industrialist, and former Burlington City Schools chairman Walter M. Williams. The school entered its seventh decade of operation in the 2011 school year. It has been recognized by the United States Department of Education as one of the top six high schools in North Carolina, and received the Blue Ribbon School designation in 1993. As of 2008, 30% of the staff held advanced degrees, and eleven staff members held national board teacher certification.2007–08 NC School Report Card The school has been recognized by the nearby Ramada Inn Convention Center, where a meeting room is named for the high school (the only high school in the district to be so honored) while all other meeting rooms are named for prominent North Carolina colleges and universities. In addition, the popular Mayberry restaurant across the street is a favorite student hangout and has several items on its menu named in honor of the school's mascot. Artwork by Williams students hangs in the McDonald's on Huffman Mill Road. The campus is bordered on the north by Sunset Drive and Parkview Drive, to the east by Arlington Avenue, to the southeast by South Church Street (on which street the campus actually has its address), to the south by Country Club Drive (an homage to the property being the former site of a country club), and to the west by Tarleton Avenue. Bulldog Alley, a north-south private campus street, intersects the campus with athletic facilities to the west and academic facilities to the east. Academy of Finance Williams is home to the Academy of Finance, a Career and Technical Education program that is administered in collaboration with the National Academy Foundation, a national network of high school reform focused on smaller learning communities that focus in areas such as health sciences, tourism, entertainment, or finance along with other options. Established in 2005, the Academy provides a rigorous curriculum, enhanced by opportunities to build professional relationships with area finance and business leaders, as well as demonstrate relevance through community based internship and service-learning experiences. As part of this small learning community, students have contributed to service and social justice by providing tax assistance to low income families and individuals, some of whom have contributed almost 100 service hours to the project annually. In addition, students take college level courses for credit, hear guest presentations from members of the business community, participate in internships, and take exploratory field trips to area colleges and universities. Campuses visited since 2009 include the Kenan-Flagler School of Business at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, East Carolina University, the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, and the Walker College of Business at Appalachian State University. Field-based experiences allow students to put into practice skills learned in the classroom and interact with members of the business community. In recent years, an extended classroom experience was created which allowed academy students to tour the financial district of New York City, following a similar visit to Washington, D.C. in 2008. Support for the academy from the Burlington business community is facilitated by a community-based advisory board, made up of business leaders, parents, and alumni. A student advisory board allows students to contribute to the decision-making process within the academy as well as develop leadership skills and become engaged in the life of the Academy and school at large. A partnership with Alamance Community College makes the college level coursework possible. Initiated during the administration of former principal Gary Thornburg, the academy is currently under the direction of Ms. Mary Margaret Harris. Academics Williams has a strong Advanced Placement and Honors program. During the 2008–2009 school year, 211 students took 535 Advanced Placement courses, the highest number of students taking the courses in the district.Burlington Times-News, October 28, 2009 Demographics As of the spring of 2014, nationalities represented in the student body in recent years included the United States, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, El Salvador, Greece, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Korea, Kosovo, Mexico, New Zealand (Māori), Nicaragua, Pakistan, Palestine, Peru, and Vietnam. Demographically, the student population is 52% white, 32% African-American, 10% Hispanic, 4% Asian, and 2% multiracial. Partnerships with Elon University Along with the other high schools in Alamance County, selected students from Williams are able to participate in the Elon Academy summer residential program on the campus of Elon University. Students are eligible to take college courses during the regular school year. Williams hosts student teachers from Elon on a regular basis. Namesake The school was named for Walter McAdoo Williams (March 1, 1891 – May 5, 1959), a native of Liberty, Randolph County, North Carolina, and son of Joel P. and Flora A. Spoon Williams. Considered a \\"giant in the textile world\\", he was a member of the Board of Trustees of what is now Wake Forest University and a local citizen recognized for his role in making the high school possible from a financial standpoint. In April 1912, at the age of twenty-one, he moved to Graham, North Carolina. From 1930 to 1940, he had served as Chair of the Burlington School District's school board. He was also executive vice-president and chairman of the board of Virginia Mills, based in Swepsonville, North Carolina. In 1940, he became executive vice-president and chairman of the board for Virginia Cotton Mills in Swepsonville, from which he retired on February 17, 1959. In 1945, the Williamses made the purchase of the campus land possible. When the possibility was raised that the seating capacity in the proposed auditorium would be substantially cut back, they made it possible to retain the planned 2,500 seat capacity. It is believed that the auditorium is the second largest high school auditorium on the east coast. They also donated the auditorium's organ as well as a Steinway grand piano. They were very resistant to the idea of the school being named for them. A member of both Kiwanis and Lions, Williams actively supported the Baptist Orphanage in Thomasville, North Carolina and the Masonic Orphanage in Oxford, North Carolina. The Williamses had no children of their own. In 1950, Williams was named Citizen of the Year by the Burlington Kiwanis Club.Burlington Times- News, August 1, 1993, p. G2 Williams served on the Board of Trustees of Wake Forest University during the period of the institution's transition from rural Wake County to Winston-Salem. In addition to the Williams's contributions to the high school, the organ in Wait Chapel on the Reynolda campus of Wake Forest University is named in honor of him and his wife Flonie Cooper Williams (1893–1975). The Williams donated the organ to Wake Forest in 1956. In addition, a three-manual Reuter organ was given and installed as a memorial to Williams in Binkley Chapel on the Olde Campus of Wake Forest. The Williamses were active in Hocutt Memorial Baptist Church. The school's colors of black and gold are the same as those of Wake Forest University, an institution with which Williams had ties. Williams was also a trustee for North Carolina Baptist Hospital. Ironically, Mr. Williams stopped attending school at age twelve and was largely self-taught. Williams died on May 5, 1959, after spending seven months in a coma following suffering from a brain tumor. He is buried in Pine Hill Cemetery, only a few blocks from campus, and almost within view of the school. The Burlington Board of Education had voted in November 1945 to name the school after Williams. However, the decision was not announced until October 27, 1949. Mascot and traditions The school seal was approved by vote of the student body on September 29, 1961, as was the school's Alma Mater, with words by athletic director Fred Miller and music by Harold Grant, director of bands. The seal was among forty potential seals submitted for consideration. The creator of the winning design received a prize of $7.00. The fightsong Onward Bulldogs is set to the tune of On Wisconsin. The mascot is the bulldog, which has manifested itself over the years by costumed students and real dogs (one of which was named George I). An avant-garde statue of George was dedicated outside the auditorium in 1974 in memory of Cynthia Lemar Ledbetter (a student who died in 1971) and other deceased students. The statue which sits prominently on a pedestal in Bulldog Plaza on the east side of campus, is a focal point of school-wide celebrations, and is an object of scorn and derision of students from rival high schools. It was designed by sculptor Norman Keller of East Carolina University (The Barker, December 16, 1971). School colors are black and gold, the same colors as Wake Forest University, where Williams served on the Board of Trustees. The names of the yearbook is the Doe-Wah-Jack, an American Indian term meaning \\"the first, the best\\" and has been the name of the yearbook since the school opened in 1951 (and had been the name of the Burlington High School yearbook since 1926). The newspaper is The Barker, taking its title from the sound made by the mascot. The newspaper has received awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. Upon the consolidation of the former Jordan Sellars High School into Williams at the time of school integration, a student task force representative of both schools attempted to incorporate traditions from both schools into the newly integrated Williams (1999 Williams Alumni Directory). History On October 27, 1949, the school board announced its decision to name the facility \\"Walter M. Williams High School.\\" It was constructed as the successor campus to Burlington High School. The school was built on the site of the former Piedmont Country Club. \\"The land the school is on was once a golf course; hence, the name Country Club Dr[ive]. About ... 42 acres [of the country club were] auctioned off in September 1945 or 1946. Walter Williams bought the land from the estate of Ben May. The clubhouse (now a house) sits across from the stadium.\\".E-mail from Annette Grant, September 17, 2008 The stadium on the site, now known as Burlington City Schools Stadium, was dedicated on Veteran's Day, November 11, 1949. The field house was also completed in the late 1940s. Construction began on the main building in 1949. Two cornerstones flanking the base of the front stairwell, one reading \\"AD\\" and the other \\"1949\\" attest to this fact (the cornerstone contains a sealed copper box including financial records and newspaper clippings from the period of the school's construction). The 1951 graduating class from the former Burlington High School graduated on the stage of the Williams High School Auditorium in the spring of 1951, some three months before the new school officially opened. Williams High officially opened its doors on September 5, 1951, with an enrollment approaching 1,000 (today, it has a student body approaching 1200, and in the early 1970s surpassed 1700) and a staff of 43 (as of November 2008, the school has a combined certified and classified staff of 124). The first student to arrive at school that day was Roger Cheek, who thus might be compared to Carolina's Hinton James, and be considered Williams's \\"first student.\\" Jack Lindley was the first student body president. What is now Spikes Gymnasium was completed by the opening of school in September 1955. The \\"Spikes Spaz\\" are the student supporters of Williams High's basketball teams, named for the gym's namesake, and patterned after the \\"Cameron Crazies\\" of Duke University. Prior to the completion of the gym, students in P.E. classes showered in restrooms adjacent to the cafeteria. The showers remain intact to this day. The gym was the scene of the highest points scored by any one player in the 1960s when Pistol Pete Maravich played against the Bulldogs while a student at Raleigh's Needham B. Broughton High School. The gym was the scene of a pivotal event during the period of integration. During the 1956–1957 school year, classrooms in the west wing on the Ground Floor served as overflow space for fifth grade students from nearby Hillcrest Elementary School. Prior to the school district merger between the Burlington City Schools and the Alamance County Schools (creating the Alamance-Burlington School System in 1996), Williams was one of two high schools in the former Burlington City Schools district, along with Hugh Cummings High School, which was constructed in the early 1970s to accommodate the expanded student population at Williams. Prior to integration, Williams was historically white, while Jordan Sellars High School across town was historically black. The period surrounding integregation at Williams is documented in the book Black Coach. Elvis Presley performed at Williams on February 15, 1956, at 8:00pm. Other performers scheduled for the two-hour performance included Justin Tubb (son of Ernest Tubb), Benny Martin, and \\"Mother Maybelle\\" Carter with June Carter (later June Carter Cash). Though little more is known about the concert itself, it is known that he stopped at Brightwood Restaurant on Highway 70 en route to Greensboro after the concert, where he ordered a burger and a glass of milk. The booth where he sat has been preserved with a portrait overhead. The waitress who served him that night still works there. Buddy Rich also performed at the school in the 1950s. Poet and novelist Flannery O'Connor has also appeared at Williams, along with author Timothy Tyson, who wrote Blood Done Sign My Name, 2005 summer reading selection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the inspiration of a movie by the same title released in the 1980s. William C. Friday, president of the University of North Carolina from 1956 to 1985, was the featured speaker at an awards assembly in the 1980s. Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel has also spoken at the school. Judge Henry Frye, the first African-American chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court also spoke at the school, as has Lonice Bias, mother of University of Maryland basketball player Len Bias. Prior to the completion of the \\"Tobacco Road\\" stretch of Interstate 85 through Alamance County in 1960, US Route 70 (which runs concurrent with Church Street) was a major east-west route, placing the school on a major thoroughfare, which most likely led to the academic landmark becoming familiar to east-west travelers. In the fall of 1960, ninth grade students began attending what was then the newly opened Turrentine Junior High School. Ninth graders did not attend Williams again until after the former Jordan Sellars campus was no longer used as a ninth grade center. Following a 1971 desegregation order which sought to eliminate racial segregation at Sellars Gunn, ninth grade students were sent to Sellars Gunn. Eventually, the Jordan Sellars campus transitioned into a campus to house alternative educational programs in 1995, and both Williams and the Hugh M. Cummings campus returned to a four-year format in 1982. Like many cities in the south, Burlington experienced tension during the period of integration in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Prior to the appointment of Jerome Evans as head coach, a sit-in was held on the front lawn to communicate concerns about a lack of diversity on the cheerleading squad. Following the sit-in, a march to the school district office was held. This period in history was explored in Daniel Koehler's documentary Burlington: A City Divided, which was featured at the Reynolda Film Festival at Wake Forest University in the spring of 2010, at which director Spike Lee, known for his films on themes of social justice, was the featured guest speaker.http://www.yesweekly.com/article-9004-reynolda- film-festival-remains-true-to-its-vision.html The 1975–1976 school year marked the national bicentennial, the 25th anniversary of the opening of Williams, and the 50th anniversary of the school's yearbook, the Doe-Wah-Jack; this had been the name of the yearbook at the former Burlington High School. According to Gillespie, yearbook staff members who saw the word on a local stove learned that it is an American Indian word meaning \\"the first, the best\\". This was submitted to students and was chosen as the name of the yearbook.V. Gillespie In 1986, a fire in a chemistry lab caused several thousand dollars worth in damage. Three football coaches took turns crawling along the floor to put the fire out.Wilmington Star News Predecessor schools The original Burlington High School was located on Broad Street, and served students until 1951. It is from this school that the names of the yearbook and student newspaper are carried on. Jordan Sellars High School, a historically black institution, closed its doors in 1970, at which time all of its students were integrated into the student body at Williams. In 1971, the Burlington City Schools were placed under a court order to integrate, leading to ongoing federal court supervision of the school system's operations (as well as those of the subsequent Alamance Burlington School System). The 1971 order sought to eliminate racial segregation at was Jordan Sellars, which the federal court determined was being operated as a racially identifiable school in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pursuant to the order, the former Burlington City District attempted to end segregation at what was now Sellars-Gunn by converting it into a junior high school for all Burlington ninth grade students, regardless of race. Sellars-Gunn remained a ninth-grade school from 1971 until 1982, when it was closed and its students were moved to the two high schools – Cummings High and Williams High (Caron Myers press release, July 20, 2009). In 1995, Sellars-Gunn re-opened as an alternative education center. It houses several of the school system's alternative education programs, including a Career-Technical Education program and a voluntary program for students suspended for more than 10 days from other Alamance- Burlington schools (Caron Myers press release, July 20, 2009). Feeder schools Most ninth graders previously attended nearby Turrentine Middle School, constructed in the early 1960s. The four elementary schools that ultimately feed into Williams are Smith, Grove Park, Highland, and Hillcrest. In addition, some students from Blessed Sacrament School choose to attend Williams upon reaching ninth grade. Facilities One of the most historically architecturally unique high school buildings still in use in North Carolina, it is three stories tall, centered around an interior courtyard area now used for parking. Unique in architectural style, it is reminiscent of the classic industrial-like high school architecture representative of the 1950s. The main academic building consists of three wings: the Main Wing, the East Wing, and the West Wing. From above, the building looks like a dogbone. The main wing includes the cafeteria, the historic academic hall, and classrooms. The east wing includes office facilities, the media center, classrooms, and the Academy of Finance. The west wing includes science and home economics classrooms. The cafeteria (lunchroom) is furnished like a 1950s diner. When the school was originally constructed, the cafeteria's service area contained separate restrooms for \\"white and colored help\\",Burlington Daily-Times News, May 19, 1951, p. 10B thus accounting for two sets of men's and women's restrooms being located virtually side by side. After a renovation in the summer of 2009, the cafeteria was outfitted with four HDTV televisions that display menus. Just off the south hall of the second floor of the West Wing is what was initially designed as the Home Economics Suite, designed to provide a \\"homelike\\" area for home economics (family and consumer sciences) instruction, and includes a replicated living room area (now used as a faculty workroom/conference room), complete with fireplace, along with a replicated bedroom (which now serves as an assistant principal's office) and dining room, which now serves as a faculty office. This area adjoins the room in which food service classes are taught. The door leading into the area resembles that of a front door to a home. The auditorium is one of the largest auditoriums in North Carolina, with more seats than auditoriums at many major universities (UNCG's Aycock Auditorium was originally built to seat only a hundred or so than the Williams auditorium seats). The \\"auditorium seats over 2100 and includes a balcony that makes it reminiscent of a traditional downtown theatre. Because it is the largest facility of its kind in Alamance County, the auditorium is used for many outside performances and graduations, as well as Williams's school functions\\" (\\"Williams High Auditorium\\" greeting card, back side). At the time of construction, it was said to be second only to Raleigh's Memorial Auditorium in terms of seating capacity. includes a pipe organ donated by the Williamses, a rarity among even older high schools, which is generally used only during commencement exercises. Its dedicatory concert was performed by world-renowned concert organist Virgil Fox on October 19, 1951. The Burlington newspaper billed the organ as one of \\"the largest organ installations in the South.\\" French organist Pierre Cochereau has performed there as well. The auditorium was the first part of the facility to be completed, and was used for the Burlington High School Class of 1951's commencement ceremony before the completion of the rest of the building. Thrice in the 1950s, the Miss North Carolina Pageant was held here. During the early years of the school, there was a designated student \\"smoking room\\" where students, with parental permission, were allowed to go smoke after lunch. Students were required to show a red card to the faculty members (later student government officers) that supervised the room. A street known as \\"Bulldog Alley\\" intersects the campus, with the main school building on the east side of the street, with major athletic facilities on the west side of the street. The third part of the main building to be constructed is the Spikes Gymnasium. The gymnasium was named in honor of Dr. Lewis Everett Spikes on June 13, 1993. Dr. Spikes served as Superintendent of the Burlington City Schools from 1936 to 1963. Athletic facilities include the Tommy Spoon Memorial Field House (named in memory of a star member of the football team and former athletic director who died in the late 1990s), the Kernodle football field, and the 10,000 seat Burlington City Schools stadium.Jordan, Black Coach, p. 49 The campus is also known for its vast front lawn that faces South Church Street. The area, which is protected from development by city ordinance, hosts youth soccer events and is a seating area for community fireworks displays. Renovations begun during the summer of 2008 on the Second Floor have vastly improved the library facilities, as well as lighting. Renovations are expected to continue on the remainder of the main building over the next several summers. Service clubs Throughout the school's history, major service clubs have included the Key Club and the former Keywannettes (known as the Keyettes prior to being chartered at Williams as the Keywannettes in 1977, a female counterpart to Key Club prior to the 1976 international vote to admit female students), and the Junior Civitans (and the former Civanettes for female students). Both organizations were represented among the school's co-curricular offerings when the school initially opened. According to Kiwanis International, the organization date of the Key Club is May 26, 1947, which would indicate that the club's charter was carried over from the former Burlington High School, which would indicate that the club is one of few students organizations to actually predate the opening of the present facility (E-mail from Nikki Reynolds, KI Member Services Representative, August 14, 2008). Over the course of the Key Club's history, several district and international officers have come from Williams, including two district secretaries, two district governors, and four international trustees (Carolina Key, 2008). During the 1970s, the Key Club members at Williams were informally referred to as \\"the Keys\\" in the student newspaper. Additionally, during the 1970s the service clubs saw a fraternity/sorority like \\"rush\\" process of new member recruitment which including formal teas, visitations, and \\"pledging.\\" Interact (sponsored by Rotary International) is inactive at Williams, as is a fourth group, the school's Junior Exchange Club, now known as Excel Clubs. Honor societies An organization that predated the opening of the school was the Burlington Chapter of the National Honor Society which was chartered on November 7, 1930 on the campus of the former Burlington High School. As the National Honor Society itself was formed in 1921, this would make the Williams chapter one of the oldest continuously operating chapters in the nation. The charter date of the now defunct Quill and Scroll chapter at Williams was listed as 1938, thereby being another organization carried over from the former Burlington High School. Other active honor societies include the National Art Honor Society, the Latin Honor Society, the Spanish Honor Society, the French Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta math honor society, and the National Career/Technical Honor Society. The school's Tri-M Music Honor Society chapter was chartered in February 2000. However, the chapter has been inactive since 2005. Career and technical student organizations The school's award-winning DECA chapter (formerly known as Distributive Education Clubs of America), is advised by Williams faculty member and alumnus Rhonda Farmer. At the 2011 North Carolina state conference, three students qualified to compete at the International DECA career development conference, held in Orlando, Florida. The school hosts chapters of FCCLA, FBLA, and HOSA. Athletics The school's athletic program consists of the following sports: tennis, cross-country, football, basketball, soccer, swimming, golf, track & field, wrestling, baseball, softball, and lacrosse, introduced in the spring of 2010. The lacrosse program was started by a group of Williams's parents, and the first lacrosse coach was Stephen Bailey, who is also the head coach of the Elon University men's lacrosse team. The current Varsity lacrosse coach is Hugh Fiery. The 1952 baseball team won the North Carolina AAA championship. For many years, the athletic facilities were used by sports teams from Elon University. =Football program= The first football coach, Stan Huffman, had served on the coaching staff at Burlington High School before joining Williams during its inaugural year, serving as head coach until 1954. In 2010, he was presented an award at the annual Alamance County high school football press conference. The second coach, Richard \\"Bud\\" Phillips, served from 1954 to 1957. A native of Guilford County, Phillips graduated from the former Burlington High School, and earned an athletic scholarship to Wake Forest College to play baseball and football. Following his freshman year, Phillips served in the United States Army during World War II. He completed his Wake Forest education after serving his military duty. In 1957 Mr. Phillips left Williams to become the high school football coach at Junius H. Rose High School in Greenville, North Carolina, and in 1970 became the athletic director, retiring in 1991. Phillips was honored twice as the Athletic Director of the year in North Carolina, in 1982 and 1987 and served as president of the North Carolina Athletic Director's Association from 1981 to 1982. He served on the board of the National Interscholastic Athletic Administrators Association, representing the Southeastern section of the country and received that organization's Distinguished Service Award in 1982. He also received the NIAAA's State Award of Merit in 1988, the first year it was presented. At the time of his retirement from Rose in 1991, Phillips was the longest serving faculty member at Rose, having served since the school opened in 1957, a period of almost thirty-five years. Upon Phillips's departure for Greenville in 1957, Bill England was appointed coach, and served until 1960. From 1960 to 1970, the team was led by Cicero Abraham Frye. Frye was a 1951 graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who came to Williams in 1956 as the assistant football coach and head basketball coach, after having served as basketball coach at Pfeiffer College. He became head football coach after the departure of Coach England in 1961. Upon his replacement by Jerome Evans, left to coach at Gibsonville High School in 1970. His career and personality is described to some extent in the book Black Coach in the context of the circumstances surrounding his departure. Serving as head coach for ten years, Coach Frye had the longest period of service as head coach until this record was broken in 1994 by Coach Story. The career of football coach Jerome Evans, who served from 1970 to 1976, is documented in the book Black Coach by Pat Jordan (published by Dodd Mead of New York in 1971), which also documents related racial tensions in the community at that time. A graduate of North Carolina Central University, Evans was appointed as head coach in the fall of 1970 during the period of integration. He was briefly alluded to in the film Remember the Titans (which tells the story of a football team at another Williams High School, located in Virginia). In the fall of 1976, when Coach Evans turned to administrative duties full-time, a new head football coach, Pete Stout, was hired, and the Williams athletic program changed from class 4-A to class 3-A. The 1980 football team won the state championship, the first for Williams. A second state championship was won in 1981. The Bulldog teams during both these championship seasons had a record of 14-0, a record that has not been matched at the school. The 1982 team also went undefeated until the first round of the 3-A playoffs, losing to Jamestown Ragsdale 7-6 in a torrential rainstorm that covered the state of North Carolina. Coach Stout left Williams in 1983 for Catawba College (now University) and their football program. Sam Story, who coached at Duke University, took over and served from 1984 until his retirement in 2008. Coach Story led the Bulldogs to the 3-A state championship in 1985, defeating Havelock High School 7-3 at Memorial Stadium in Burlington. The 1987 team lost to Shelby High at Memorial Stadium. The Bulldogs under Story, also won the title in 1999 against Asheville High 20-7 at Kenan Stadium in Chapel Hill. This championship was notable for the fumblerooski play that Coach Story always kept in his arsenal of plays. Story was the North Carolina head coach for the 2007 Shrine Bowl game. In 2007, the football field was named in honor of Dr. Kernodle, the long-time football team physician, who continues to support the Bulldogs to this day. From 2008 to 2010, the team was led by Scott Frazier, a Williams alumnus, formerly on the staff of Western Carolina University, Elon University, where he served as defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator, and Presbyterian College, where he served as the offensive line coach and recruiting coordinator. Prior to joining the Elon staff, Frazier was a graduate assistant coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for three years, where he served under head coach John Bunting, spending the 2001 and 2002 seasons as the Tar Heels' assistant offensive line coach. He also served as a defensive graduate assistant for the Tar Heels in 1996, under head coach Mack Brown. At Williams, he had played under Coach Story in the late 1980s, and had served as defensive line coach at Williams during the fall of 2004. David Green came to Williams as head coach in 2011 from Leesville Road High School in Raleigh. Fine arts Visual art, pottery, band, orchestra, chorus, Musical theater, and modern dance are among the opportunities available to students. The Marching Bulldogs perform at all home football games and select away games. An art show is held each spring, featuring student work as well as the work of visiting local artists. The chorus program puts on a homecoming show starring George Bulldog and a musical revue in the spring. In recent years auditioned members from the choral groups have also performed internationally in Italy and Austria. Students have been selected to participate in the North Carolina High School Honors Chorus, most recently in 2009. The band program has received extensive recognition at contests and festivals over the years. The Marching Bulldogs were the official marching band of the 2007 Shrine Bowl. Award- winning orchestral groups have traveled to competitions in New York City and Gatlinburg, Tennessee in recent years. Leadership The first principal, Calvin C. Linnemann, served from 1951 to 1957. He had served as principal of Burlington High School, and was a published author in the NASSP Journal. He was also a Sunday School teacher at Burlington's First Baptist Church and was later superintendent of schools. The second principal of Williams, Lester R. Ridenhour (1915–1985) served from 1957 to 1960. He had served as principal of Broad Street School (the former campus of Burlington High School), and prior to that as assistant principal of Williams. In 1983, he received the Outstanding Alumni Award from East Carolina University, where he had completed degrees in 1939 and 1949. While at East Carolina, he played baseball, football, basketball, and tennis. He was inducted into the East Carolina University Sports Hall of Fame in 1979 (www.ecupirates.com). The Lester R. Ridenhour Memorial Scholarship is presented to residents of Alamance County who attend East Carolina University. The third principal of Williams, Cleet C. Cleetwood (1923–2007), a 1943 graduate of Appalachian State University, served an abbreviated administration from 1960 to 1962, at which time he was scheduled to be reassigned to the central office, but turned in his resignation instead (later serving as Superintendent of the Greenville City Schools system in Pitt County, c. 1971). At Appalachian, he had lettered \\"in football, basketball and baseball, (later) he was called into service with the U.S. Air Force, serving during World War II as a B-17 navigator. He enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he earned his master's degree and lettered in varsity baseball. Prior to coming to Williams, he had begun his career in education coaching football, basketball and baseball at Rocky Mount High School in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Following a period of playing professional baseball, he began work at Duke University toward his doctoral degree.\\" (http://www.thepilot.com/stories/20070529/news/obits/20070529Cleetwood.html). Even into his late 70s, he played basketball with the state senior games (The Pilot, January 30, 2000). The fourth principal of Williams, Jesse Weldon Harrington, who came to Williams from New Hanover High School in Wilmington, North Carolina was the longest serving principal, serving from 1962 through 1978. Born and raise in Moncure in adjacent Chatham County, he earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from what is now Elon University. He was serving as principal during the period covered in the book Black Coach in which author Pat Jordan described him as exhibiting a \\"busy but relaxed exterior\\" (Jordan, Black Coach, p. 136). He is the only former principal at the school to have a scholarship exclusively for Williams High seniors named in his honor. Mr. Harrington now lives in the Wilmington area. The school had three principals in the 1980s. Marsh Lyall served as the fifth principal from 1979 to 1983. Lyall departed to assume the superintendency of the Wilkes County Schools. Clinton E. Leggett served as the sixth principal from 1983 to 1986. After serving as principal, the seventh principal of Williams, Harold Brewer (1986–1992) later served as Superintendent of Montgomery County Schools (from 1996–2001), and later Senior Associate for Organizational Development for Durham Public Schools (from 2001–2002)and then as Sr. VP for Programs for the Centers for Quality Teaching and Learning, based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Prior to 1996, he was the assistant director of the Principals' Executive Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for two years. For a time, he was also Assistant Superintendent for Burlington City Schools. Prior to coming to Williams, he had served as an administrator in Duplin County and Moore County, as well as eight years of business management in the textile industry. Brewer held an ED. Specialist, (6yr) degree in school administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; a master's degree in school administration from Appalachian State University; and a bachelorˆs degree in psychology from what is now the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. He has served as Senior Vice-President for Programs for the Centers for Quality Teaching and Learning based in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was Brewer who set the goal of achieving distinction as a Blue Ribbon School. A reminder of the Brewer era is the phrase \\"Brewer the Great\\" inscribed in concrete on a sidewalk running parallel to Bulldog Alley. Mr. Brewer's son served as student body president one year. These were followed by the eighth principal, James Daye (1992–1994), who had served as principal of Watauga High School in Boone, and had served at the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, and the ninth principal, Donald Andrews (1994–1996). Andrews later served as superintendent of the Harnett County Schools, and since 2005 has served as Superintendent of the Randolph County Schools, southwest of Burlington. Phillip Deadmon served as the tenth principal from 1996 to 2001. Upon his retirement, Jack Butler served as interim principal in 2001. Gary Thornburg, who in June 2010 retired from the principalship of Cedar Ridge High School, served as principal from 2001 to 2005. Mr. Thornburg was recognized as the 2005 Regional Wachovia Principal of the Year. It was during Thornburg's administration that the Academy of Finance was established. Dr. George W. Griffin, formerly of Apex High School and North Carolina Central University served from 2005 to 2007. Nola Taylor, the school's first female principal, was appointed in 2007, and served until 2011. Ms. Taylor, a graduate of Indiana University and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro came from principalships in Guilford County Schools. She now serves with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. Dr. Joe Ferrell was named as Ms. Taylor's successor in July 2011. At the time of his appointment, he had served as principal at Eastern Guilford Middle School since 2004, and had served as principal at Hunter Elementary School in Greensboro. In Person County, he taught at the elementary and middle school levels, and served as an assistant principal at Northern Middle School in Roxboro. Ferrell holds degrees from Elon University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Here are listed the principals in chronological order: # Calvin C. Linnemann (1951–1957, six years) # Lester R. Riderhour (1957–1960, three years) # C. C. Cleetwood (1960–1962, two years) # Jesse W. Harrington (1962–1978, sixteen years) # Marsh Lyall (1979–1983, four years) # Clinton E. Leggett (1983–1986, three years) # Harold Brewer (1986–1992, six years) # James Daye (1992–1994, two years) # Donald Andrews (1994–1996, two years) # Phillip Deadmon (1996–2001, five years) # Jack Butler (2001, interim) # Gary Thornburg (2001–2005, four years) # George Griffin (2005–2007, two years) # Nola Taylor (2007–2011, four years) # Dr. Joe Ferrell (2011–2016, five years) With the exception of Jesse W. Harrington (who served for sixteen years), no principal has served longer than six years. As many as seven other principal's terms can be included in the length of Harrington's term. The current assistant principal team consists of Yolanda Anderson, Robert Drummond and Bear Bryant. While there have been approximately forty assistant principals since the school's opening in 1951, perhaps the best known and most influential is Jerome Evans, who was appointed assistant principal at the same time he became head football coach in 1970. Although known primarily for his coaching role, his administrative leadership ensured a peaceful transition through the period of integration, serving as assistant principal for over two decades. His life story and influence is still taught to students as part of the curriculum of the history course covering the 1960s. Another former assistant principal, Lairron G. Guthrie, concurrently served as Mayor of Burlington from 1973 to 1975, and later served as guidance counselor. Dr. Patricia Bason served as assistant principal from 1983 to 1988, and later served on the faculty of Elon University. She was succeeded by Shirley Faircloth, who served from 1988 to 1997. Ms. Faircloth had taught English, served as advisor to The Barker for fourteen years, and founded the Williams English Honor Society. Although she served as assistant principal for nine years, her total length of service at Williams was twenty-nine years. John Heath served from 2008 to 2012, having served at Cedar Ridge High School. Kent Byrd served from 1998 to 2000, and later served as principal of Southern Alamance High School before joining the staff of the central office.

Lighting control systems are widely used on both indoor and outdoor lighting of commercial, industrial, and residential spaces. Lighting control systems serve to provide the right amount of light where and when it is needed. Lighting control systems are employed to maximize the energy savings from the lighting system, satisfy building codes, or comply with green building and energy conservation programs. Lighting control systems are often referred to under the term Smart Lighting.  Lighting controls The term lighting controls is typically used to indicate stand-alone control of the lighting within a space. This may include occupancy sensors, timeclocks, and photocells that are hard-wired to control fixed groups of lights independently. Adjustment occurs manually at each devices location. The efficiency of and market for residential lighting controls has been characterized by the Consortium for Energy Efficiency. The term lighting control system refers to an intelligent networked system of devices related to lighting control. These devices may include relays, occupancy sensors, photocells, light control switches or touchscreens, and signals from other building systems (such as fire alarm or HVAC). Adjustment of the system occurs both at device locations and at central computer locations via software programs or other interface devices. =Advantages= The major advantage of a lighting control system over stand-alone lighting controls or conventional manual switching is the ability to control individual lights or groups of lights from a single user interface device. This ability to control multiple light sources from a user device allows complex lighting scenes to be created. A room may have multiple scenes pre-set, each one created for different activities in the room. A major benefit of lighting control systems is reduced energy consumption. Longer lamp life is also gained when dimming and switching off lights when not in use. Wireless lighting control systems provide additional benefits including reduced installation costs and increased flexibility over where turns off and sensors may be placed. Automated control Lighting control systems typically provide the ability to automatically adjust a lighting device's output based on: *Chronological time (time of day) *Solar time (sunrise/sunset) *Occupancy using occupancy sensors *Daylight availability using photocells *Alarm conditions *Program logic (combination of events) =Chronological time= Chronological time schedules incorporate specific times of the day, week, month or year. =Solar time= Solar time schedules incorporate sunrise and sunset times, often used to switch outdoor lighting. Solar time scheduling requires that the location of the building be set. This is accomplished using the building's geographic location via either latitude and longitude or by picking the nearest city in a given database giving the approximate location and corresponding solar times. =Occupancy= Space occupancy is primarily determined with occupancy sensors. =Daylight availability= Electric lighting energy use can be adjusted by automatically dimming and/or switching electric lights in response to the level of available daylight. Reducing the amount of electric lighting used when daylight is available is known as daylight harvesting. =Alarm conditions= Alarm conditions typically include inputs from other building systems such as the fire alarm or HVAC system, which may trigger an emergency 'all lights on' or ' all lights flashing' command, for example. =Program logic= Program logic can tie all of the above elements together using constructs such as if-then-else statements and logical operators. IEC 62386-104 Types In the 1980s there was a strong requirement to make commercial lighting more controllable so that it could become more energy efficient. Initially this was done with analog control, allowing fluorescent ballasts and dimmers to be controlled from a central source. This was a step in the right direction, but cabling was complicated and therefore not cost effective. Tridonic was an early company to go digital with their broadcast protocols, DSI, in 1991. DSI was a basic protocol as it transmitted one control value to change the brightness of all the fixtures attached to the line. What made this protocol more attractive, and able to compete with the established analog option, was the simple wiring. There are two types of lighting control systems which are: * Analog lighting control * Digital lighting control Examples for analog lighting control systems are: * 0-10V-based system. * AMX192-based systems (often referred to as AMX) (USA standard). * D54-based systems (European standard). In production lighting 0-10V system was replaced by analog multiplexed systems such as D54 and AMX192, which themselves have been almost completely replaced by DMX512. For dimmable fluorescent lamps (where it operates instead at 1-10 V, where 1 V is minimum and 0 V is off) the system is being replaced by DSI, which itself is in the process of being replaced by DALI. Examples for digital lighting control systems are: * DALI-based system. * DSI-based system * DMX512-based systems (often referred to as simply DMX). * KNX-based systems Those are all wired lighting control systems. There are also wireless lighting control systems that are based on some standard protocols like MIDI, ZigBee, Bluetooth Mesh, and others. The standard for digital addressable lighting interface, mostly in professional and commercial deployments, is IEC 62386-104. This standard specifies the underlying technologies, which in wireless are VEmesh, which operates in the industrial Sub-1 GHz frequency band and Bluetooth Mesh, which operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. Theatrical lighting control Architectural lighting control systems can integrate with a theater's on-off and dimmer controls, and are often used for house lights and stage lighting, and can include worklights, rehearsal lighting, and lobby lighting. Control stations can be placed in several locations in the building and range in complexity from single buttons that bring up preset options-looks, to in-wall or desktop LCD touchscreen consoles. Much of the technology is related to residential and commercial lighting control systems. The benefit of architectural lighting control systems in the theater is the ability for theater staff to turn worklights and house lights on and off without having to use a lighting control console. Alternately, the light designer can control these same lights with light cues from the lighting control console so that, for instance, the transition from houselights being up before a show starts and the first light cue of the show is controlled by one system. Bluetooth lighting control The new type of control for lighting system is using Bluetooth connection directly to the lighting system. It was introduced by Philips HUE and company new name as Signify formerly known as Philips Lighting. This system will need a smartphone or tablet where the user can install a special Philips Hue Bluetooth app. The Bluetooth bulbs don't need a Philips Hue bridge to function. There is no need to have a Wi-Fi or data connection for controlling the lights with that system.

Notable silver rushes have taken place in Mexico, Chile, the United States (Colorado, Nevada, California, Utah), and Canada (Cobalt, Ontario, and the Kootenay district of British Columbia). Several famous tourist towns owe their existence to silver rushes. History Historically there were other \\"silver rushes\\", such as on the Attic peninsula near Athens, Greece, thousands of years ago. The silver mines of Laurion became famous for their exploitation and helped fund the new state of Athens. The term is also widely applied to the New World. Despite the larger-than-life image of the gold rush, the history of towns and industry in the North American West revolves much more around silver. This is partly because of the other minerals usually found with it – lead, tin, copper – and the more complicated smelting process associated with it because of the chemical complexity of its ores (usually galena). The line between a smelter town and a silver mining town is very slim in many cases, although copper mining towns typically also have large smelters (such as Anaconda, Montana) and industrial complexes associated with them. The pursuit for silver often opens up other mineral deposits for development because of the variety of other useful ores that occur with it, especially in galena, its most common natural form. Hence the Boundary Country of British Columbia, just across the international border from Spokane, Washington, had a strong mining and smelting economy based on the non-silver components of galena, and the nearby city of Trail remains a functioning smelter town (long after the long-established industrial complex of the Boundary District has faded into a ghost town). Hardrock mines tend to last longer than placer gold mines, and so silver mining towns last longer and have more time to develop than placer gold rush towns, which often peak within a few years. Silver mining towns typically last a few decades, with time to develop the opulence and luxury that only left the slightest traces in placer gold-fevered places such as Dawson City in the Klondike. By contrast, \\"silver cities\\" like Aspen, Colorado, and Nelson, British Columbia, often survived as functioning economies into the era of modernization and the advent of tourism (which sometimes proves richer than any silver mine).

Suicide Club concerns the mass suicide of 54 schoolgirls and how it leads the law to a shadowy cult. Noriko's Dinner Table takes place before, during, and after the previous installment's timeline as an attempt to resolve several questions left unanswered. Noriko's Dinner Table explores various issues including the generation gap in modern families, the malleability of personal identity, social alienation, suicide, and the use of the Internet. The film was released theatrically in Japan on September 23, 2006, and won the Don Quixote award at the 40th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic and a special mention. Plot The film is divided into 5 chapters, the first four of which are named after characters in the film: Noriko, Yuka, Kumiko and Tetsuzo, in that order. The plot is told non-linearly and shifts between the perspectives of Noriko, Yuka and Tetsuzo. A shy and demure 17-year-old girl named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fukiishi) lives with her quiet family, formed by her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata), and her father Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi), in Toyokawa, Japan. Noriko finds her small- town life unsatisfying and craves to move to Tokyo, assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her elementary school friend Tangerine (Yoko Mitsuya) is now working independently as an idol. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city, and plans on having her join a local university after school. Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents, Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com, a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There, after making new and unknown friends, she feels truly at \\"home\\" and eventually, on December 10, 2001, runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo, where she plans on meeting the website's leader, a mysterious girl who uses the screen name \\"Ueno Station 54\\". Once in Tokyo, Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station, where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. Kumiko introduces Noriko to her family and takes her to visit her grandparents. As it turns out, however, Kumiko has no real family, and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation, I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid rental family services to interested clients, allowing them to fulfill their fantasy of a happy family life. Six months later, 54 girls jump in front of a train at Shinjuku station and commit suicide while Noriko and Kumiko look on. It is implied that the 54 were members of the organization acting out their roles. Back in Toyokawa, Yuka, who was also a member of Haikyo.com, wonders if her sister was involved in the mass suicide. She writes a story speculating how her father would react if she were to disappear as well, and deliberately leaves clues before running off to Tokyo to join I.C. Corp. Tetsuzo attempts to put on a brave face after Yuka's disappearance, but his wife Taeko's mental condition deteriorates rapidly and she eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile, Tetsuzo, a reporter, gathers clues regarding his daughters' disappearances and discovers Yuka's story. He is crushed to find that his daughter could predict his actions and behaviour so accurately while he was completely unaware of his daughters' feelings. His investigations reveal Haikyo.com and taking a cue from sensationalist media tabloids, he concludes that his daughters are part of a cult called the \\"Suicide Club\\". Tetsuzo contacts a member of I.C. Corp, who refutes the existence of a \\"suicide club\\" and instead expounds on a concept of social roles that forms the basis of his organisation. Tetsuzo gets an old friend of his, Ikeda (Shirou Namiki) to pose as a client for I.C. Corp and rent Kumiko as his wife, and Noriko and Yuka as his daughters (who go by the aliases Mitsuko and Yoko respectively). Tetsuzo finds a house in Tokyo resembling his own and moves all the furniture from the old house to the new one so that it will resemble it exactly. Mitsuko and Yoko are unsettled when they arrive at the house, but they fall back into their roles when prompted by Kumiko. Ikeda sends Kumiko away on an errand and Tetsuzo reveals himself. The girls, however, treat him as a stranger and insist that they are Mitsuko and Yoko, not Noriko and Yuka. As the session falls apart, thugs from the organisation arrive on site to beat up Tetsuzo, who attacks them with a knife and kills all of them in the living room. Kumiko arrives from her errand shortly thereafter, playing out her role as if nothing is wrong, but then imploring Tetsuzo to kill her and run away with Noriko and Yuka. Her insistence gravely disturbs Noriko and Yuka, before Yuka interrupts the heated conversation and asks to 'extend the session'. Finally, Tetsuzo, Kumiko, Mitsuko and Yuka dine together as a happy family and Tetsuzo begins acting as if Kumiko is his wife, calling her Taeko. Yuka does not sleep that night and leaves the home at the crack of dawn, shedding her role and name. Mitsuko awakens shortly thereafter and, speaking to herself, bids goodbye to Yuka, adolescence, Haikyo.com and Mitsuko, before finally declaring that she is Noriko. By the end of the film, two years have passed, including eighteen months since the mass suicide.

It was colloquially referred to as \\"The Bridge to Nowhere\\". It was constructed from 1958-1963 by PennDOT, and opened for traffic October 17, 1969 with its predecessor Manchester Bridge (located closer to the tip of Point State Park) closing that same day (it was demolished in the autumn of 1970). The bridge was given the name \\"The Bridge to Nowhere\\" because the main span was finished in 1963, but due to delays in acquiring right of ways for the northern approach ramps, it did not connect on the north side of the Allegheny River. The total cost was budgeted at $5 million in 1962. The lack of approach ramps meant the bridge ended in midair, rendering it useless. The northwestern ramps were completed in 1969, allowing access to Pennsylvania Route 65. The northeastern ramps were completed in 1986, with the construction of the northern section of Interstate 279 (North Shore Expressway) which runs through Downtown Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle and north towards Interstate 79. The bridge touches down halfway between Heinz Field and PNC Park Baseball Stadium on the City's North Shore. \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\" in 1966 On December 12, 1964, Frederick Williams, a 21-year-old chemistry major at the University of Pittsburgh from Basking Ridge, New Jersey, drove his 1959 Chrysler station wagon through the bridge's wooden barricades, raced off the end of the bridge, and landed upside-down but unhurt on the other side, 190 feet away at the north bank of the Allegheny River.Pittsburgh's bridge to nowhereKingsport Times-News, \\"Bridge Barriers Didn't Bar Him\\", Dec. 13, 1964 His adventure is documented in WQED-TV's double Mid-Atlantic region Emmy Award-winning documentary \\"Flying off the Bridge to Nowhere and Other Tales of Pittsburgh Bridges\\", narrated by Rick Sebak. Within a few weeks of this near tragedy, an iconic Pittsburgh radio personality, Rege Cordic, distributed commemorative bumper stickers which read \\"Official Entry, Cordic & Company Bridge Leap Contest.\\" With thousands of vehicles bearing these stickers on Pittsburgh's streets, the city responded by blocking off the end of the bridge with concrete barriers.

It is mostly known for its high gain amps such as its flagship model, the Soldano SLO-100, but the product lineup also includes effect units, pedals and cabinets. All Soldano products are tube-based and are class A/B. History Michael Soldano originally worked with his head technician Bill Sundt at Stars Guitars (San Francisco, CA), modifying amps brought to him. He had built his first amp, a Fender Bassman clone, with the aid of books being discarded by a library. Michael worked on modifying his version of the Bassman for years, until he bought a Mesa/Boogie Mark II and began modifying this amp. The first three SLO amps were based upon this amp and the first one was sold to a female friend. The second one was sold to Howard Leese from the band Heart. Within six months, he had sold amps to Steve Lukather, Michael Landau, Vivian Campbell, Aldo Nova, John Fogerty and Lou Reed. Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler purchased the SLO-100 when first released in 1987. Guitarist Tommy Kessler of Blondie uses the SLO-100(100W) amplifier head in Snakeskin and a matching 2×12 cabinet as part of his touring rig.The Official Gear Page of Tommy KesslerTommy Kessler Tour Rig Video 2010 In 1991, Eddie Van Halen used a SLO 100 (which replaced his famous Marshall 1959 due to technical issues) for the album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. Eddie would then go on to design the Peavey 5150, which was based on the Soldano. The Experience Music Project in Seattle contains an area where visitors can play instruments, such as the electric guitar. These rooms contain Soldano amplifiers, along with various Squier guitars (including Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars).

Brooks studied embryological development in invertebrates and founded a marine biological laboratory where he and others studied heredity. His best known book, The Oyster, was first published in 1891 and has been reprinted many times. Brooks was proficient in many subjects, including Greek and biology, and as a young man was unsure where he wished to focus his studies. He spent two years at Hobart College before settling on biology, and then transferred to Williams College, where he received his BA in 1870. He then entered Harvard and studied under Louis Agassiz, receiving his PhD in 1875.https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/william-keith-brooks-1848-1908 A year later he became a junior faculty member at Johns Hopkins University when it opened, teaching and researching marine biology. After marrying Amelia Katherine Schultz in 1878, Brooks founded the Chesapeake Zoological Laboratory. He spent most summers at this laboratory, which moved around each summer from Crisfield, Maryland, and Hampton, Virginia, to Beaufort, North Carolina, Jamaica, and the Tortugas. Commissioned by the state of Maryland to study the American oyster, Brooks’ findings led to the discovery that fertilization of this type of oyster, unlike the European form, occurred outside the body.https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/william-keith-brooks-1848-1908 At Hopkins, Brooks began as an associate (equivalent to assistant professor) and advanced to associate professor in 1883 and was made Professor of Morphology in 1889. In 1894 he succeeded H. Newell Martin as head of the Department of Biology. During his research, Brooks performed studies on invertebrates, particularly germ cells, and found evidence to explain variation among species due to ancestral heredity as well as Charles Darwin’s theory of pangenesis.https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/william-keith- brooks-1848-1908 In addition to his publications, Brooks received honorary degrees from Hobart College, Williams College, and the University of Pennsylvania. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Philosophical Society, Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia, the Boston Society of Natural History, the Maryland Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Society of Zoologists, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Royal Microscopical Society.https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/william-keith-brooks-1848-1908 Brooks died in 1908 due to a congenital heart defect.https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/william-keith-brooks-1848-1908 He published: * Hand-Book of Invertebrate Zoölogy (1882) * The Law of Heredity (1883) * The Development and Protection of the Oyster in Maryland (1884) * Lucifer: A Study in Morphology (1881) * The Stomatopoda of H.

Its slope is the acceleration at that point. In mechanics, the derivative of the position vs. time graph of an object is equal to the velocity of the object. In the International System of Units, the position of the moving object is measured in meters relative to the origin, while the time is measured in seconds. Placing position on the y-axis and time on the x-axis, the slope of the curve is given by: :v = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta s}{\\\\Delta t}. Here s is the position of the object, and t is the time. Therefore, the slope of the curve gives the change in position divided by the change in time, which is the definition of the average velocity for that interval of time on the graph. If this interval is made to be infinitesimally small, such that {\\\\Delta s} becomes {ds} and {\\\\Delta t} becomes {dt}, the result is the instantaneous velocity at time t, or the derivative of the position with respect to time. A similar fact also holds true for the velocity vs. time graph. The slope of a velocity vs. time graph is acceleration, this time, placing velocity on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. Again the slope of a line is change in y over change in x: :a = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta v}{\\\\Delta t} where v is the velocity, and t is the time. This slope therefore defines the average acceleration over the interval, and reducing the interval infinitesimally gives \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{dv}{dt} \\\\end{matrix}, the instantaneous acceleration at time t, or the derivative of the velocity with respect to time (or the second derivative of the position with respect to time). In SI, this slope or derivative is expressed in the units of meters per second per second (\\\\mathrm{m/s^2}, usually termed \\"meters per second-squared\\"). Since the velocity of the object is the derivative of the position graph, the area under the line in the velocity vs. time graph is the displacement of the object. (Velocity is on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. Multiplying the velocity by the time, the time cancels out, and only displacement remains.) The same multiplication rule holds true for acceleration vs. time graphs. When acceleration is multiplied by time, velocity is obtained. Variable rates of change In this example, the yellow area represents the displacement of the object as it moves. (The distance can be measured by taking the absolute value of the function.) The three green lines represent the values for acceleration at different points along the curve. The expressions given above apply only when the rate of change is constant or when only the average (mean) rate of change is required. If the velocity or positions change non-linearly over time, such as in the example shown in the figure, then differentiation provides the correct solution. Differentiation reduces the time-spans used above to be extremely small (infinitesimal) and gives a velocity or acceleration at each point on the graph rather than between a start and end point. The derivative forms of the above equations are :v = \\\\frac{ds}{dt}, :a = \\\\frac{dv}{dt}. Since acceleration differentiates the expression involving position, it can be rewritten as a second derivative with respect to time: :a = \\\\frac{d^2 s}{dt^2}. Since, for the purposes of mechanics such as this, integration is the opposite of differentiation, it is also possible to express position as a function of velocity and velocity as a function of acceleration. The process of determining the area under the curve, as described above, can give the displacement and change in velocity over particular time intervals by using definite integrals: :s(t_2)-s(t_1) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{v}\\\\, dt, :v(t_2)-v(t_1) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{a}\\\\, dt.

Later versions were produced in cheaper plastic package. CIA MOS 6526A in plastic package The 6526/8520 Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) was an integrated circuit made by MOS Technology. It served as an I/O port controller for the 6502 family of microprocessors, providing for parallel and serial I/O capabilities as well as timers and a Time-of-Day (TOD) clock. The device's most prominent use was in the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128(D), each of which included two CIA chips. The Commodore 1570 and Commodore 1571 floppy disk drives contained one CIA each. Furthermore, the Amiga home computers and the Commodore 1581 floppy disk drive employed a modified variant of the CIA circuit called 8520. 8520 is functionally equivalent to the 6526 except for the simplified TOD circuitry. Parallel I/O The CIA had two 8-bit bidirectional parallel I/O ports. Each port had a corresponding Data Direction Register, which allowed each data line to be individually set to input or output mode. A read of these ports always returned the status of the individual lines, regardless of the data direction that had been set. Serial I/O An internal bidirectional 8-bit shift register enabled the CIA to handle serial I/O. The chip could accept serial input clocked from an external source, and could send serial output clocked with one of the built-in programmable timers. An interrupt was generated whenever an 8-bit serial transfer had completed. It was possible to implement a simple \\"network\\" by connecting the shift register and clock outputs of several computers together. The maximum bitrate is 500 kbit/s for the 2 MHz version. The CIA incorporates a fix to a bug in the serial-shift register in the earlier 6522 VIA. The CIA was originally intended to allow fast communication with a disk drive, but in the end couldn't be used because of a desire to keep disk drive compatibility with the VIC-20; in practice the firmware of 1541 drive had to be made even slower than its Vic-20 predecessor to workaround a behaviour of the C64's video processor, that, when drawing the screen, turned off the CPU for 40 microseconds every 512 microseconds and in that timeslice can't listen to the bus, risking to miss some bit . articles on c64-wiki.com Interval timers Two programmable interval timers were available, each with sub-microsecond precision. Each timer consisted of a 16-bit read-only presettable down counter and a corresponding 16-bit write-only latch. Whenever a timer was started, the timer's latch was automatically copied into its counter, and the counter would then decrement with each clock cycle until underflow, at which an interrupt would be generated. The timer could run in either \\"one-shot\\" mode, halting after the first interrupt, or \\"continuous\\" mode, reloading the latch value again and starting the timer cycle anew. In addition to generating interrupts, the timer output could also be gated to the second I/O port. As configured in the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128, the CIA's timing was controlled by the phase two system clock, nominally one MHz. This meant that the timers decremented at approximately one microsecond intervals, the exact time period being determined by whether the system used the NTSC or PAL video standard. In the C-128, clock stretching was employed so the CIA's timing was unaffected by whether the system was running in SLOW or FAST mode. It was possible to generate relatively long timing intervals by programming timer B to count timer A underflows. If both timers were loaded with the maximum interval value of 65,535, a timing interval of one hour, 11 minutes, 34 seconds would result. Time-of-Day (TOD) Clock A real-time clock is incorporated in the CIA, providing a timekeeping device more conducive to human needs than the microsecond precision of the interval timers. Time is kept in the American 12-hour AM/PM format. The TOD clock consists of four read/write registers: hours (with bit 7 acting as the AM/PM flag), minutes, seconds and tenths of a second. All registers read out in BCD format, thus simplifying the encoding/decoding process. Reading from the registers will always return the time of day. In order to avoid a carry error while fetching the time, reading the hours register will immediately halt register updating, with no effect on internal timekeeping accuracy. Once the tenths register has been read, updating will resume. It is possible to read any register other than the hours register \\"on the fly,\\" making the use of a running TOD clock as a timer a practical application. If the hours register is read, however, it is essential to subsequently read the tenths register. Otherwise, all TOD registers will remain \\"frozen.\\" Setting the time involves writing the appropriate BCD values into the registers. A write access to the hours register will completely halt the clock. The clock will not start again until a value has been written into the tenths register. Owing to the order in which the registers appear in the system's memory map, a simple loop is all that is required to write the registers in the correct order. It is permissible to write to only the tenths register to \\"nudge\\" the clock into action, in which following a hardware reset, the clock will start at 1:00:00.0. In addition to its timekeeping features, the TOD can be configured to act as an alarm clock, by arranging for it to generate an interrupt request at any desired time. Due to a bug in many 6526s (see also errata below), the alarm IRQ would not always occur when the seconds component of the alarm time is exactly zero. The workaround is to set the alarm's tenths value to 0.1 seconds. The TOD clock's internal circuitry is designed to be driven by either 50 or 60 Hz clock signal, which can be inexpensively derived from the mains power source AC, resulting in a stable timekeeper with little long-term drift. The ability to work with both power line frequencies allowed a single version of the 6526 to be used in computers operated in countries with either 50 or 60 Hz mains power lines. It is important to note that contrary to the popular belief, NTSC or PAL video standards are not directly linked to mains power frequency. Additionally, some computers did not derive their TOD clock frequency from the mains power source. For example, both NTSC and PAL variants of Commodore SX-64 use 60 Hz TOD clock supplied by a dedicated crystal. KERNAL operating system in Commodore 64 for example will determine the video standard during system startup, but tries neither to identify the supplied TOD clock frequency nor to initialise the CIAs correctly on 50 Hz driven machines. Thus, it is the responsibility of any application software that wants to use either CIA's TOD function to determine the supplied frequency and set the CIA(s) flag accordingly itself. Failure to do so may cause the clock to deviate quickly from the correct time. The 8520 revision of the CIA, as used in the Amiga and the Commodore 1581 disk drive, modified the time-of-day clock to be a 24-bit binary counter, replacing the BCD format of the 6526. Other behavior was similar, however. Versions The CIA was available in 1 MHz (6526), 2 MHz (6526A) and 3 MHz (6526B) versions. The package was a JEDEC-standard 40-pin ceramic or plastic DIP. The 8520 CIA, with its modified time-of-day clock, was used in the Amiga computers. Commodore embedded reduced (just 4 registers) CIA-like logic for the cost reduced Commodore 1571 inside the C128DCR (See Commodore 128) in a gate array called 5710 which also contains other functions. The 5710 CIA has the serial clock for the fast serial interface hardwired to a CIA6526 equivalent Timer A value of 5, leading to a per-bit time of 5μs on transmission. This is different from what used to be a Timer A value of 6 in the 6526 CIA in the original Commodore 1571. The 5710 CIA does not contain timer or timer control registers. It only contains two port registers and the register to control the serial shifter and its event. Errata In addition to the aforementioned alarm clock interrupt bug, many CIAs exhibited a defect in which the part would fail to generate a timer B hardware interrupt if the interrupt control register (ICR) was read one or two clock cycles before the time when the interrupt should have actually occurred. This defect, as well as logic errors in the Commodore provided (8 bit) operating system, caused frequent pseudo-RS-232 errors in the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 computers when running at higher baud rates.

On 15 January 1900 he moved to Edmonton, Alberta and became choirmaster for All Saints parish church, which became pro-cathedral of the Church of England in Canada in 1914, and stayed in that post for fifty-six years. In 1903 Barford organized the Edmonton Amateur Operatic Society, and was musical director for seven years. In 1904 he created Edmonton's first opera, The Chimes of Normandy. On 1 September 1905, when Alberta had joined the Dominion of Canada, Barford conducted the first official concert at Thistle Rink. in 1908 Barford worked with three others to create the Alberta Provincial Festival (now known as the Edmonton Kiwanis Music Festival) and was president of it for seven years. In 1912, Barford began the University of Alberta Glee Club. Then in 1924 he was awarded with the honorary degree by the U of A.

The bridge was projected to cost $398 million. Members of the Alaskan congressional delegation, particularly Representative Don Young and Senator Ted Stevens, were the bridge's biggest advocates in Congress, and helped push for federal funding. The project encountered fierce opposition outside Alaska as a symbol of pork barrel spending and is labeled as one of the more prominent \\"bridges to nowhere\\". As a result, Congress removed the federal earmark for the bridge in 2005. Registration required.

Background According to the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities, the project's goal was to \\"provide better service to the airport and allow for development of large tracts of land on the island\\". The Ketchikan and Gravina Island Ferry in 2005 A ferry runs to the island every 30 minutes, and every 15 minutes during the May–September peak tourist season. It charges $6 per adult, with free same-day return, and $7 per automobile also with same day return. According to USA Today, the bridge was to have been nearly as long as the Golden Gate Bridge which is long, and \\"higher than the Brooklyn Bridge.\\" The bridge would cross the Tongass Narrows, part of Alaska's Inside Passage, so the bridge was designed to be tall enough to accommodate ship traffic, including the Alaska Marine Highway and the cruise ships that frequent Alaskan waters during the summer. Ketchikan's airport is the second largest in Southeast Alaska, after Juneau International Airport, and handled over 200,000 passengers a year or 550 per day, while the ferry shuttled 350,000 people in the same time period (). A number of alternative bridge routes were considered. The decision in September 2004 was actually for two bridges, connecting Pennock Island in the middle, and is known as Alternative F1. The west span of the bridge was designed to have a vertical clearance of , and the east span of the bridge was to have a vertical clearance of . History The controversy began with the 2006 National Appropriations Bill, an omnibus spending bill covering transportation, housing, and urban development for the following year. On October 20, 2005, H.R. 3058 [109th] act's first version passed the U.S. Senate with 93 votes for, 1 against. On October 21, 2005, Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) offered an amendment to remove funds for the Gravina Island and Knik Arm bridges, and divert the funds to rebuild a bridge over Lake Pontchartrain that was damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska became the object of strong media criticism when he strongly opposed diverting the Gravina and Knik Arm Bridge funds to help in the disaster aid. In his speech on the Senate floor, Stevens threatened to quit Congress if the funds were removed from his state. On November 16, 2005, Congress stripped the specific earmark allocation of federal funds for the two bridges in the final edition of the omnibus spending bill, without changing the amount of money allocated for use by Alaska. The Coburn Amendment was defeated with a heavy bipartisan majority, with 15 senators in favor of the amendment and 82 senators in opposition. On September 20, 2006, Sarah Palin visited Ketchikan on her gubernatorial campaign and said the bridge was essential for the town's prosperity. In September 2006, during her campaign for Governor, Sarah Palin visited Ketchikan to express her support for the Gravina Island Bridge project. At a public forum, Palin held up a pro-bridge T-shirt designed by a Ketchikan artist, Mary Ida Henrikson. The legend on the shirt was \\"Nowhere Alaska 99901\\", referencing the buzzword of \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\" and the primary ZIP code of Ketchikan. In her public comments, referring to her own residence in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, she said: \\"OK, you’ve got Valley trash standing here in the middle of nowhere. I think we’re going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project\\" in response to an insult expressed by the state Senate president, Ben Stevens. In October 2006, when asked, \\"Would you continue state funding for the proposed Knik Arm and Gravina Island bridges?\\", she answered: \\"Yes. I would like to see Alaska's infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later. The window is now – while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist.\\" Later that month, at a Chamber of Commerce meeting in Wasilla, Alaska, Democratic candidate Tony Knowles criticized Palin for supporting the Knik Arm Bridge, the Gravina Island Bridge, and a road north out of Juneau instead of rebuilding the Parks Highway. The Ketchikan Daily News noted that, of the gubernatorial candidates, \\"Only Palin is consistent in support all of the projects\\".DOT says hurry ordered on bridge Ketchikan Daily News, October 21, 2006 During her inaugural address on December 4, 2006, Governor Palin pledged responsible spending. On January 17, 2007, she sent a revised budget to the president of the Alaska Senate that would restrict capital spending and rescinded the $185M state share of the bridge funding. In August 2007, Alaska's Department of Transportation stated that it was \\"leaning\\" toward alternative ferry options, citing bridge costs and the reluctance of Governor Palin to pay the state's match to the appropriated federal funds. A month later, in September 2007, Palin formally canceled the project. Palin stated: > Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport, but the $398 million > bridge is not the answer. Despite the work of our congressional delegation, > we are about $329 million short of full funding for the bridge project, and > it’s clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a > bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island. Much of the public’s attitude > toward Alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects > here. But we need to focus on what we can do, rather than fight over what > has happened. Asked why she initially supported the bridge, Palin's communications director Bill McAllister said, \\"It was never at the top of her priority list, and in fact the project isn't necessarily dead … there's still the potential for improved ferry service or even a bridge of a less costly design\\". She changed her mind, he said, when \\"she saw that Alaska was being perceived as taking from the country and not giving\\". The city of Ketchikan has already begun to develop roads and a small amount of infrastructure for Gravina Island's 50 inhabitants. However, residents continue to seek funding for the Ketchikan- Gravina span. 2008 campaign issue On August 29, 2008, when introduced as Republican presidential nominee John McCain's running mate, Governor Palin told the crowd: \\"I told Congress, thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere\\" – a line that garnered big applause but upset political leaders in Ketchikan. Palin's campaign coordinator in the city, Republican Mike Elerding, remarked, \\"She said 'thanks but no thanks,' but they kept the money.\\" Ketchikan's Democratic Mayor Bob Weinstein also criticized Palin for using the term bridge to nowhere, which she had said was insulting when she was in favor of the bridge. Although Palin was originally a main proponent of the bridge, McCain–Palin television advertisements claimed that Palin \\"stopped the Bridge to Nowhere\\". Palin's Chief of Staff, Billy Moening, has been praised by many Republican strategists for recommending Palin change her stance on the bridge. These claims have been widely questioned or described as misleading in several newspapers across the political spectrum. Howard Kurtz called this a \\"whopper\\", writing: \\"She endorsed the remote project while running for governor in 2006, claimed to be an opponent only after Congress killed its funding the next year and has used the $223 million provided for it for other state ventures.\\" Newsweek, commenting on Palin's \\"astonishing pivot\\", remarked: \\"Now she talks as if she always opposed the funding.\\" McCain himself also weighed in on the Gravina Island Bridge. In advertisements, McCain labeled the bridge as wasteful spending, and in an August 2007 town hall speech recorded on video and quoted again on April 30, 2008, he blamed the Minneapolis I-35 bridge collapse on the Gravina Island Bridge. His advertising and comments that (before September 21, 2006) contradicted Governor Sarah Palin's support of the bridge drew the attention of the media when he chose Palin as his running mate, opening the ticket to charges of hypocrisy. While discussing the Gravina Island Bridge during an ABC News interview that aired on September 12, 2008, Charles Gibson made the following comment: \\"but it's now pretty clearly documented. You supported that bridge before you opposed it. You were wearing a T-shirt in the 2006 campaign, showed your support for the bridge to nowhere.\\" Palin interrupted Gibson and insisted, \\"I was wearing a T-shirt with the zip code of the community that was asking for that bridge. Not all the people in that community even were asking for a $400 million or $300 million bridge.\\" Many media groups in the U.S. noted that Palin changed her position regarding the bridges, and concluded that she exaggerated her claim that she stopped the proposals from going through. According to the Los Angeles Times, for instance, while seeking votes for her governorship race, Palin told Ketchikan residents that she backed the \\"bridge to nowhere\\"; as governor, she spent the money elsewhere and moved ahead with a $26-million road to the nonexistent bridge. Road to nowhere After canceling the bridge, Palin's administration spent more than $25 million to build the Gravina Island Highway, which would have connected with the proposed bridge. According to Alaskan state officials, the road project went ahead because the money came from the federal government, and would otherwise have had to be returned.Kizzia, Tom. \\"Palin touts stance on 'Bridge to Nowhere,' doesn't note flip-flop\\" , Anchorage Daily News (2008-08-31) Because \\"no one seems to use\\" this road, it has been called the \\"road to nowhere\\" by CNN, many local Alaskans, and several other media sources. CNN reporter Abbie Boudreau took a helicopter over the road. \\"There's no one on this road,\\" she said. \\"It kind of just curves around then it just stops. That's where the bridge was supposed to pick up.\\" Boudreau spoke to Mike Elerding, Palin's former campaign coordinator. When asked if he felt the road was \\"a waste of taxpayer money\\", he responded, \\"Without the bridge, yeah.\\" Boudreau also spoke to the McCain–Palin campaign spokesperson Meghan Stapleton, who defended the road: \\"The governor could not change that earmark. ... That had to be spent on the Gravina road and nothing else. And so, the governor had no options.\\" In response to an inquiry of whether Palin could have stopped construction, Stapleton told Boudreau that Palin had \\"no viable alternative\\" because Congress had already granted the earmark and the contract for the road was signed before Palin took office. Alaska Department of Transportation spokesman Roger Wetherell disagreed, stating that Palin could have canceled the contract upon taking office and reimbursed contractors for any expenses incurred in association with the project, as happened when Palin cancelled a $18.6 million contract on a Juneau road and reimbursed the contractor for $65,500 in expenses. Federal Highway Administration spokesman Doug Hecox stated that Palin could have opted not to use the federal earmark, which would have allowed Congress the opportunity to send it to other federal needs. 2011 activity In HR662 there is continued funding for the project. Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) spoke in support of a motion to recommit the bill, with a very specific amendment, explained in his words, \\"This motion rescinds all remaining funds, about $183 million, provided for the planning, design and construction of the two bridges under SAFETEA-LU\\" and that \\"According to the CBO this motion will reduce the deficit by $160 million by eliminating funding for these two bridges, nothing else.\\"House Session Mar 2, 2011, Legislation. c-spanvideo.org. Retrieved March 4, 2011. \\" C-SPAN Video Library \\" :3/2/2011 4:10pm: Floor summary: DEBATE - The House proceeded with ten minutes of debate on the Polis motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the Committee on Transportation to report the bill back to the House forthwith, with an amendment which inserts a section rescinding all unobligated balances of contract authority provided or reserved for planning, design or construction of the Gravina Island bridge, Alaska, or the Knik Arm bridge, Alaska. In response, Rep. Mica (R-FL), spoke in opposition responding, \\"Well, congratulations, my colleagues; welcome to the era of smoke and mirrors, and that's exactly what this motion to recommit is and I urge its defeat. And you heard the gentleman describing bridges, and he again is trying to mislead the entire House on this particular motion to recommit. It is smoke and mirrors, and I urge the defeat of the motion to recommit\\", which was the complete argument and explanation he gave, even though he was allotted a full 5 minutes to respond. Failed by recorded vote: 181–246, 2 present Cancellation In 2015, after consideration of several lower-cost options, the Gravina Island Bridge project was finally cancelled, an improved ferry service being selected instead of constructing the bridge.

Its Richardsonian Romanesque church building, which was built in 1905-06, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1831 young people in the New England area were encouraged to take advantage of the fertile land in Illinois, being sold cheaply. On February 9, 1831, The New Hampshire Gazette printed a notice from the Illinois Colonial Association that a meeting would be held in a local coffee house in Northampton, Massachusetts on Wednesday, the 16 February 1831 at 10:00 A. M. The purpose of this meeting was to organize a Church fellowship before going out west. This idea was growing in the area and flyers were sent out stating: :“It was not so much to promote the private interests of its members as to advance the cause of Christ by planting religious institutions in the virgin soil of the west and aiding the cause of Christian education in its various departments.” When more than a few people offered themselves to this effort, a council was convened. This is how Hampshire Colony Congregational Church was founded on March 23, 1831. Ebenezer Strong Phelps, a deacon at Northampton Church, was one of the charter members and the council meeting was held in his home. The 18 charter members of the church came not only from the Northampton church but from surrounding churches as well. They came from Belchertown, Conway, Amherst, Warwick, Springfield, South Hadley, and even Putney, Vermont. The purpose of this church start was clear. In fact, at the service held to organize the church, even the council was made up of pastors and laymen from three of the churches. It is fitting then, to name the church Hampshire Colony, after the county where it was founded. The council was held. After they went to the church to worship. Rev. Ichabod Spencer preached a sermon and quoted Luke 12:32, “Fear not little flock, it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.” After the sermon they took communion with the large congregation that had gathered to see them off, and a collection of $54.00 was given to supply the infant church with new vessels for the communion table. The church is now a member of the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.

Early life Herbert's grandfather was John Hyland, one of the first settlers of the South Yarra and Prahran regions. The Hyland family also participated in the 1 November 1837 land sale, purchasing an allotment between Bourke St and Little Bourke st, Melbourne (after Williamstown ) nomination of Melbourne's first Magistrate,Cannon, M. (1978). Historical Records of Victoria: Vol. 1. Melbourne University Press. p. 36 and were the original owners of the Freemason's Tavern, South Yarra. Herbert attended Caulfield state school until the early deaths of his parents forced him to leave at the age of 12 and take a job in a grocery store in Glenhuntly. Hyland eventually moved to South Gippsland, establishing his own general store and mixed grocery business. On 8 May 1912 at her parents' home at Galaquil he married with Methodist forms 18-year-old Amelia Mary Barratt (died 1968); their son and daughter were to predecease him, to his deep distress. Career As Hyland's business flourished, he diversified into dairy farming and became a major landowner in the region. He was ruled unfit for war service, but proved a staunch advocate of soldier settlers. Elected in 1923 to the Woorayl shire council (president 1928–1929), he took an increasingly active role in community affairs, joined the Country Party and served as president of its Central Gippsland district council. His commercial ventures proved so profitable in the late 1920s that he was able to retire early and devote himself to community causes. In 1927 Hyland unsuccessfully contested the newly created seat of Wonthaggi in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. In 1929, with the aid of preferences from the Labor Party, Hyland defeated the sitting Nationalist member for the seat of Gippsland South and entered state parliament. Appointed minister without portfolio in the minority Country Party government of Sir Albert Dunstan in June 1936, Hyland was promoted to various ministries, both in minority Country Party and in coalition cabinets, until the election of the Cain government in 1952 brought a temporary halt to the instability of Victorian politics. Hyland's portfolios included Transport (1938–43), Chief Secretary (1943–45), State Development (1947–48 and 1950–52), Labour (1947–48), Decentralisation (1948) and Transport and Prices (1950–52). Knighted in 1952,It's an Honour. Retrieved 3 April 2014 Hyland was elected leader of the parliamentary Country Party in 1955. In the early years of Sir Henry Bolte's Liberal government, Hyland took advantage of the premier's inexperience to extract concessions, especially relating to freight charges. Hyland often railed against Bolte for his alleged Melbourne bias. Often Hyland was given to extravagant and vituperative language. In a debate in parliament in 1958 he called Bolte a 'mongrel' and referred to another minister as 'a stupid looking goof'. He was suspended from parliament in 1960 for describing the speaker as being 'as silly as a billy goat'. Despite these outbursts, Hyland was generally liked by his colleagues. Hyland was unexpectedly replaced as parliamentary leader of the Country Party by George Moss in 1964. Death Sir Herbert Hyland died on 18 March 1970 at Prahran, Victoria; he was accorded a state funeral and was cremated with Anglican rites.

Situated entirely within Barker Reservoir, a large flood control structure, the park covers , most of which is undeveloped forest used for the storage of floodwater.Encyclopædia Britannica Almanac 2006, pg. 272 A variety of public recreation facilities are located along Westheimer Parkway, which bisects the park, including soccer and baseball field complexes, a shooting range, and a dog park. Named in honor of former Houston-area U.S. Representative and President George H. W. Bush, the park was known as Cullen–Barker Park until 1997. Overview The large park, located on the far west side of Houston, serves as an attraction and nature reserve for the Buffalo Bayou, a major water source in the park. Since the park is entirely located within the normally dry Barker Reservoir, it is subject to routine flooding and closure during times of high rain fall. Most of the attractions are located on Westheimer ParkwayPark Layout (not to be mistaken with Westheimer Road / FM 1093), a major thoroughfare in the park. The park hosts a large group of soccer fields, baseball/softball fields, a shooting range, model aircraft flying fields, and numerous pavilions, playgrounds, ponds and jogging trails. The park is also a popular geocaching destination. History Before the area was known as part of Houston, the marsh was part of the Stephen F. Austin colony. After settlers in the area moved out of the park, much of its land was sold to ranchers. In the 1880s, a railway named the Texas Western Narrow Gauge Railroad ran trains from Houston to surrounding areas. Barely lasting one decade, the line was forced to shut down due to bankruptcy, yet still the park considers it a heritage. Cattle and farms occupied the area throughout the early 1900s, until the it became parkland in the mid-1940s. The United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed Barker Reservoir in the 1940s to limit flooding along Buffalo Bayou in Houston. The present area occupies about half of the original area.George Bush Park - History The park stayed under the name Cullen–Barker Park until January 1997, when Harris County Commissioner Steve Radack proposed the name George Bush Park in honor of the 41st President of the United States, George H. W. Bush. In May of that year, the former president attended the opening ceremony, and the park received its new name. On September 13, 2011, during the 2010–13 Southern United States and Mexico drought, a significant wildfire broke out within the park. At its zenith, the fire was wide, consuming over of reservoir grassland. Shortly afterward, a man was arrested in connection with the blaze, but charges were dropped and the arson investigation was inconclusive.  Facilities  =Jogging & biking trails= Looking westward along an artificial channel in the park.The park has a system of jogging trails, many surrounded by swamps, forest, and bayous. Many of the trails follow the Buffalo Bayou, and biking is popular year round. The trail is well known for its flexibility in biking; many speed bikers ride the trails. It is very similar to the nearby Terry Hershey Park in that both feature paved trails. A critical shortcoming of the trail system is that the sole paved trail does not form a loop, requiring cyclists to either ride in the traffic lanes of high- speed thoroughfares or retrace their route. In addition to the biking trail, there is a large wooden bridge that crosses the Buffalo Bayou, dubbed \\"the Boardwalk\\" officially. Capable of holding 5 tons (10,000 lbs.), the Boardwalk was a recent addition, built in 2004, mainly to cross the swampy, meandering Buffalo Bayou.George Bush Park - Boardwalk The bayou flows slowly and unsteadily in the area, spilling some of its water into swamps as it conjunctions with a second bayou. The Boardwalk provides easy access across the bayou, seating, but no access to the Buffalo Bayou shoreline. =Sports fields= The park hosts two large, green soccer fields. These are commonly used for local-area teams to run practice drills. The first one is located near the western entrance, and the second, which is slightly smaller, is located near the baseball fields. There are six baseball fields in the park. Four of them are reserved for the West Oaks Little League. The other two are public fields. =American Shooting Centers= The American Shooting Centers reserves of land near the southeast entrance for shooting.

This specifically includes high blood pressure, chest pain from not enough blood flow to the heart, and heart failure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, feeling tired, diarrhea, and swelling in the legs. More severe side effects include worsening asthma, blocking the ability to recognize low blood sugar, and worsening heart failure. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may be harmful to the baby. Bisoprolol is in the beta blocker family of medications and is of the β1 selective type. Bisoprolol was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1986. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Bisoprolol is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 268th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions.  Medical uses  Zebeta 5-mg oral tablet Bisoprolol is beneficial in treatment for high blood pressure (hypertension), reduced blood flow to the heart (cardiac ischemia); congestive heart failure, and preventive treatment before and primary treatment after heart attacks, decreasing the chances of recurrence. Bisoprolol targets hypertension (elevated blood pressure). In cardiac ischemia, the drug is used to reduce the activity of the heart muscle, so reduces oxygen and nutrient demand, and reduced blood supply can still transport sufficient amounts of oxygen and nutrients.  Side effects  Overdose of bisoprolol leads to fatigue, hypotension, low blood sugar, bronchospasms, and bradycardia. Bronchospasms and low blood sugar because at high doses drug can be an antagonist for β2 adrenergic receptors located in lung and in liver. Bronchospasm is due to blockage in lungs of β2 receptor and low blood sugar because of decreased stimulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver via β2 receptor. = Cautions = Beta-blockers should generally be avoided in people with a history of asthma or bronchospasm as they may make the disease worse. A beta 1 selective beta blocker like bisoprolol may be tried in those in whom other options are not available.  Pharmacology  = Mechanism of action = Bisoprolol is cardioprotective because it selectively and competitively blocks catecholamine (adrenaline) stimulation of β1 adrenergic receptors (adrenoreceptors), which are mainly found in the heart muscle cells and heart conduction tissue (cardiospecific), but also found in juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney. Normally, adrenaline and noradrenaline stimulation of the β1 adrenoreceptor activates a signalling cascade (Gs protein and cAMP) which ultimately leads to increased contractility and increased heart rate of the heart muscle and heart pacemaker, respectively. Bisoprolol competitively blocks the activation of this cascade, so decreases the adrenergic tone/stimulation of the heart muscle and pacemaker cells. Decreased adrenergic tone shows less contractility of heart muscle and lowered heart rate of pacemakers.  β1-selectivity  Selectivity of various β-blockers Bisoprolol β1-selectivity is especially important in comparison to other nonselective beta blockers. The effects of the drug are limited to areas containing β1 adrenoreceptors, which is mainly the heart and part of the kidney. Bisoprolol minimizes the side effects that might occur from administration of a nonspecific beta blocker where blockage of the other adrenoreceptors (β2, β3, α1, α2) occurs. The other receptors elicit a variety of responses in the body, and their blockage could cause a wide range of reactions, but β1 adrenoreceptors are cardiospecific for the most part, making bisoprolol ideal for treatment of cardiac events. Bisoprolol has a higher degree of β1-selectivity compared to other β1-selective beta blockers such as atenolol, metoprolol, and betaxolol. However nebivolol is approximately 3.5 times more β1-selective.  Renin-angiotensin system  Bisoprolol inhibits renin secretion by about 65% and tachycardia by about 30%. = Pharmacokinetics = Bisoprolol has both lipid- and water-soluble properties. It has an approximate half-life of 10–12 hours, and when ingested has high bioavailability (approx. 90%). When being eliminated, the body evenly distributes it (50–50) between kidney excretion and liver biotransformation (then excreted). History Bisoprolol was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1986. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992. Society and culture Bisoprolol is available as a generic medication. = Brand names = In India, it is sold under trade name Bisotab and is available in 2 strengths of 2.5 mg and 5 mg.

Franklin Mountains State Park is open year-round for recreational hiking, mountain biking, picnicking and scenic driving and vistas. History Native Americans and other travelers have used the natural resources in the Franklin Mountains when crossing the gap between the Franklin Mountains and the Juarez Mountains that is now Ciudad Juárez across the Rio Grande in Mexico and El Paso. Pictograms and mortar pits confirm a human presence in the mountains dating back more than 12,000 years. The Franklin Mountains are most likely named after Benjamin Franklin Coons, who in 1849 purchased a ranch in what is now El Paso. At first known as Coons Ranch, by 1851 the settlement took on Coons' middle name and was called Franklin. Despite the town being officially named El Paso in 1852, the locals continued to call it Franklin throughout the 1850s. The El Paso Tin Mining and Smelting Company operated a tin mine on the northeast slope of North Franklin Mountain from 1909 to 1915. While the mine had the distinction of being the only tin mine ever located in the U.S., it was an economic failure. Efforts to grant protected status to the Franklin Mountains began as early as 1925. A real estate developer sought to build housing on the mountains and in 1979 he built a road up into them. A local organization known as the Wilderness Park Coalition was able to convince the Texas Legislature to protect the mountains in 1979. Despite this success the legislature, in the same bill, prohibited funding for the development, operation and maintenance of the park. The property was formally acquired in 1981. Changes to the legislation were made in 1985 when a plan for park development was established and the park was opened to the public in 1987. Geology The Franklin Mountains are long and wide and stretch from El Paso into New Mexico. The Franklins were formed due to crustal extension related to the Cenozoic Rio Grande rift. Although the present topography of the range and adjoining basins is controlled by extension during rifting in the last 10 million years, faults within the range also record deformation during the Laramide orogeny, between 85 and 45 million years ago. The Precambrian rocks atop North Franklin Mountain are \\"the highest geological structure in the state of Texas.\\" The highest peak is North Franklin Mountain at . North Franklin Peak can be accessed via a trail located east of Mundy's Gap. The mountains are composed primarily of sedimentary rock with some igneous intrusions. Geologists refer to them as tilted-block fault mountains and in them can be found billion-year-old Precambrian rocks, the oldest in Texas. Ecology Franklin Mountains State Park is part of the Chihuahuan Desert. The plants and wildlife found in the park, despite it being within a city, are typical of those found throughout the rest of the desert. Barrel cactus, yucca, Mexican and California poppies are common plants. Trees like cottonwood, hackberry, juniper and oak grow along the springs on the mountain slopes. Mammals in the park include mule deer, mountain lions, ring-tailed cat and a variety of rodents. Birds observed at the park included golden eagles, owls, hawks, and a wide variety of smaller birds. Recreation Franklin Mountains State Park is open for year-round recreation. Development of the park is limited and much of the land is far from paved access roads and parking areas. Two hiking trails can be accessed from Woodrow Bean Transmountain Drive. Plans for a network of of hiking trails are under consideration. Rock climbing is permitted in the park and well established climbing areas are located in McKelligon Canyon The park headquarters is also located in McKelligon Canyon. Five camping areas are found in the Tom Mays Unit of the park with picnic facilities. The Wyler Aerial Tramway is an aerial tramway operated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and is located in the Franklin Mountains State Park. The tram is closed to public as of Sept. 2018. The tramway complex covers on the east side of the Franklin Mountains. The gondolas travel along two 2600 foot 1 3/8\\" diameter steel cables to Ranger Peak, above sea level. The trip takes about four minutes and lifts riders up 940 vertical feet above the boarding area.

This wide, cheerful panorama of English life follows the fortunes of two would-be artists: Nick Dormer, who throws over a political career in his efforts to become a painter, and Miriam Rooth, an actress striving for artistic and commercial success. A cast of supporting characters help and hinder their pursuits.  Plot summary  Nick Dormer wants to pursue a career in painting instead of his family's traditional role in British politics. This upsets his family and particularly his lady friend, Julia Dallow, a beautiful but demanding woman deeply involved in political campaigns. But Nick's old Oxford friend Gabriel Nash encourages him to follow his desire to become an artist. Despite his misgivings Nick goes through an election campaign, supported by Julia, and wins a seat in Parliament. He proposes marriage to Julia but they agree to wait. Meanwhile, Nick's cousin Peter Sherringham, a rising young man in the British diplomatic service, encounters a young actress, Miriam Rooth, in Paris. He falls in love with Miriam, who shows great energy but is a woefully raw talent. Peter introduces Miriam to French acting coach Madame Carre, and Miriam begins to improve her acting technique greatly. Nick seeks to become an artist and resigns from Parliament. He thus loses a large bequest from his political patron, Mr. Carteret. Nick becomes a full-time painter, and when Miriam comes to London in search of theatrical success, she sits to Nick for her portrait as \\"the tragic muse.\\" Julia finds the two together in the studio. Although nothing improper is going on, Julia suddenly and bitterly realizes that Nick is dedicated to art and will never return to politics. Peter proposes marriage to Miriam, but she refuses. Peter accepts a diplomatic assignment in Central America. Miriam eventually triumphs as an actress, especially as Juliet. Peter returns to London to see her debut in this role, and again proposes to her; but she is already married to Basil Dashwood, her business manager. The novel ends with a suggestion that Nick and Julia may eventually marry, after all.  Major themes  James completed this novel just as he embarked on his ultimately disastrous attempt to conquer the stage. The book reflects his lifelong fascination with the theater--and his ambivalent attitude towards theatrical people. Miriam Rooth is a magnificent creation, and the reader can't help but admire her tireless energy as she perfects her talent and earns great success. But James hardly portrays her as a saint, as he never minimizes her faults. In the preface to the New York Edition text of the novel, James regretted that he hadn't succeeded completely with Nick Dormer. The ambivalent politician turned painter does suffer in comparison with the radiant Miriam, but his dilemma is still interesting and sharply drawn. This novel seems strangely \\"un-Jamesian\\" in that it wanders amiably along, with a large cast-- the Henry James Encyclopedia counts more than fifty named characters, although only a dozen or so play an active role--and a lot of things happening in a sometimes disjointed way. The overarching and solidly constructed form that James usually imposes on his material appears absent here. The double plot makes for a rather sprawling book, less reminiscent of James' other novels and more like the great Victorian epics by Dickens and Thackeray.  Critical evaluation  The Tragic Muse largely failed with critics and public when it was originally published. To this day the novel has attracted relatively little critical attention. This lukewarm attitude may stem from the \\"un- Jamesian\\" nature of the book mentioned above. Aside from its preoccupation with the theater and art in general, The Tragic Muse does not address many of James' more characteristic themes. Critics have generally applauded Miriam Rooth as one of James' liveliest creations. There has been some speculation about the model for Gabriel Nash, who sounds at times like Oscar Wilde. However, James actually seems to have based the character on an acquaintance named Herbert Pratt, a well-heeled, guitar-playing American wanderer, who was a Cambridge friend of William James. Having listened to Pratt's colourful stories, James jotted down in his Notebooks on November 25, 1881: \\"[Pratt] was a most singular, most interesting type, and I shall certainly put him in a novel. I shall even make the portrait close and he won't mind...A good deal might be done with Herbert Pratt\\". Many commentators are willing to grant James' assertion in the New York Edition preface that the novel maintains a pleasant \\"tone\\" or charm or ambiance.  Stage adaptation  A dramatization of the novel was presented as part of the Gilded Stage Festival at The Metropolitan Playhouse in New York City in January 2014. The adaptation was written by Mark Dundas Wood and was directed by Jesse Jou.

In addition to a substantial number of private residences, Gottlieb also designed the New York, now Horace Mann School for Nursery Years (1965), the headquarters for the now defunct salvage and construction firm Merritt-Chapman & Scott in NY (1966) and several other large commercial projects in the New York area including a warehouse for Pirelli tires in Oakland, N.J. The New York Times quotes from him in 1989, decrying most builders' and designers' alienation from the \\"grammar\\" of good design, even when building million dollar mansions: \\"Unfortunately, a lot of these mansions are done by people who haven't studied traditional architecture very carefully. They use mass-produced windows, incorrect brick and plastic moldings ordered out of a catalogue from South Carolina. It isn't a true piece of traditional architecture, but it gives the impression of wealth.\\"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D8173CF936A35751C0A96F948260&sec;=&spon;=&pagewanted;=4 After escaping from Nazi Germany in 1934, he lived in British Mandate of Palestine before emigrating to New York in 1937.

Prelude With sizable Anglo-Portuguese forces tied up in assaulting San Sebastián and besieging Pamplona, the new French commander Marshal Soult launched a counterattack with the Armée d'Espagne through Maya and Roncesvalles. Although the French initially enjoyed local superiority, the tough terrain combined with stubborn British and Portuguese resistance slowed the French advance to a crawl. Battle A map of the battle The main French column of about 40,000 men under Clausel and Reille marched to attack Sorauren. On the 27July the heavily outnumbered British forces there were drawn up on the Oricain Ridge. Wellesley made a dramatic ride along the ridge in front of the cheering British and Portuguese troops and Soult postponed the attack until the next day. By the time the French attack was launched, reinforcements had arrived, bringing the total allied force to about 24,000 men. On the 28th the fighting at the top of the ridge was bitter and bloody, but the defenders held the French off. About midday, the 6th Division arrived and Wellesley sent them to assault the French right flank. More fresh units reached the field and Soult soon ordered a withdrawal. The French suffered 4,000 casualties, while Wellesley's army lost 1,500 British, 1,000 Portuguese and 1000 Spaniards. On the 30July the retreat from Sorauren cost the French 3,500 casualties, as they tried to get between Wellesley's army and San Sebastián. At Beunza, 5100 Portuguese and 4000 British fended off another attempt. Aftermath Sorauren land's painting eleven years after (1824) by Edward Hawke Locker, published in the work Views in Spain With his momentum lost, Soult withdrew into France to prepare his defence against the imminent Allied offensive.

She was one of several ships of that class that took part in the famous \\"six in one trip\\" in 1943 (in which six U-boats were sunk in one patrol). Service history She was built at Yarrow shipyards in Scotstoun, Glasgow. She was launched on 14 October 1942. She was adopted by the civil community of Worsley, Lancashire, as part of the Warship Week savings campaign in 1942. On 22 May 1943, she was deployed on her first mission along with fellow sloops , , , and on anti-submarine operations supporting the outward passage of Atlantic Convoy ONS 8. On 18 December 1943, she was taken in hand for repair in Liverpool, redeploying at the end of January 1944. On 31 January 1944, she sank with Starling and , and later joined Woodpecker and Kite, taking part in the sinking of the German submarines (8 February 1944), & (9 February 1944), (11 February 1944) and (15 March 1944) At the end of May 1944, she returned to Liverpool for more repairs, whilst here she was selected to take part in Operation Neptune to prevent U-Boat attacks on the D-Day invasion convoys. On 1 July 1944, she was released from Neptune and dispatched to Belfast for refit, completing in September 1944. During February and March 1945, she was deployed to the English Channel, taking part in the sinking of by the frigate and sinking herself. Following VE day, on 6 May 1945, she was nominated for transfer to the British Pacific Fleet following her second refit. By the time the refit had completed in September 1945 the Japanese had surrendered and Wild Goose was therefore surplus to requirements and was Paid off and reduced to reserve status. She was later recommissioned in 1946 and deployed to the Persian Gulf, spending the rest of her service career in the Middle East before finally decommissioning in 1955. Wild Goose was sold for breaking up in February 1956, and arrived at the breakers at Bo’ness on the Firth of Forth near Edinburgh on 26 February 1956. Today The ship's badge was saved from the breakers yard and donated to Liverpool National Maritime Museum.

He also enjoyed great success co-starring with Hermione Gingold in the three long-running Sweet and Low revues, with scripts by Alan Melville, first taking over from Walter Crisham in 1944; this was followed in June 1948 by the A la Carte revue at the Savoy Theatre.Who's Who in the Theatre, Thirteenth Edition (1961) But a greater contribution in this field was his appearance with Hermione Baddeley and Hermione Gingold ('The Two Hermiones'), Walter Crisham and Wilfred Hyde-White, in Leslie Julian Jones's revue Rise Above It, first at the Q Theatre in January 1941, when Hedley Briggs was nominally directing; then in two West End editions of the show which ran for a total of 380 performances at the Comedy Theatre opening in June 1941 and again in December 1941, when he was both starring and directing the show. As he reports in his autobiography: \\"Of all forms of theatrical entertainment, revue is the most bitchy. The material is bitchy, the artists are bitchy and, strangely enough, the average revue audience is bitchy. And here I was starring with two acknowledged 'Queens of Revue' [Baddeley and Gingold], faced also with the task of director... call[ing] for every possible ounce of tact and diplomacy. Then came the vexed question of 'billing' — who should take precedence, Baddeley or Gingold (or should I say Gingold or Baddeley)? It was the responsibility of the management to make the decision....Jack de Leon's solution was quite simple: we had two sets of bills and placards, used on alternate weeks throughout the run, which satisfied both the ladies.\\" Quoted in On Q: Jack and Beatie de Leon and the Q Theatre, by Kenneth Barrow (1992)  Director  In addition to a busy career as an actor and entertainer, he was frequently engaged as a director, notably staging the first productions of See How They Run (Peterborough Rep, tour and Q Theatre 1944; Comedy Theatre 1945), and The Shop at Sly Corner (St Martin's Theatre 1945).

It is designed as a component of ISDB-T, the terrestrial digital broadcast system used in those countries, as each channel is divided into 13 segments, with a further segment separating it from the next channel; an HDTV broadcast signal occupies 12 segments, leaving the remaining (13th) segment for mobile receivers, hence the name, \\"1seg\\" or \\"One Seg\\". Its use in Brazil was established in late 2007 (starting in just a few cities), with a slight difference from the Japanese counterpart: it is broadcast under a 30 frame/s transmission setting (Japanese broadcasts are under the 15 frame/s transmission setting).  Technical information  The ISDB-T channel allocation scheme. The ISDB-T system uses the UHF band at frequencies between 470 and 770 MHz (806 MHz in Brazil), giving a total bandwidth 300 MHz. The bandwidth is divided into fifty name channels 13 through 62. Each channel is 6 MHz wide consisting of a 5.57 MHz wide signalling band and a 430 kHz guard band to limit cross channel interference. Each of these channels is further divided into 13 segments, each with 428 kHz of bandwidth. 1 seg uses a single of these segments to carry the 1seg transport stream. 1seg, like ISDB-T uses QPSK for modulation, with 2/3 forward error correction and 1/4 guard ratio. The total datarate is 416 kbit/s. The television system uses an H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video stream and an HE-AAC audio stream multiplexed into an MPEG transport stream. The maximum video resolution is 320x240 pixels, with a video bitrate of between 220 and 320 kbit/s. Audio conforms to HE-AAC profile, with a bitrate of 48 to 64 kbit/s. Additional data (EPG, interactive services, etc.) is transmitted using BML and occupies the remaining 10 to 100 kbit/s of bandwidth. Conditional access and copy control are implemented in 1seg broadcasting by the use of Broadcast Flag-like structure contained in the \\"Copy Control Descriptor\\" within the broadcast. The broadcast contents themselves are not encrypted, but the Copy Control information forces the device to encrypt stored recordings and disallows making a copy of the recording.  Broadcast Markup Language Broadcast Markup Language (BML), is a data-transmission service allowing text to be displayed on a 1seg TV screen. The text contains news, sports, weather forecasts, emergency warnings such as Earthquake Early Warning, etc. free of charge. Further information can be found through links to content on websites, frequently those belonging to the television station itself. EPG (program guides) is not included, but transmitted in separate stream (EIT).  Multiple-program arrangement  On June 23, 2008, broadcaster Tokyo MX officially began using technology to simultaneously broadcast two programs on a single divided segment. Most 1seg receivers manufactured after September 2008 are compatible with this technology. Multiple-program arrangement in 1seg is named as . NHK Educational TV (from 1 April 2009) and (from 1 December 2009) are also started for several number of programs.  Popularity  Until the end of March 2008, Japanese regulation required that the programs on 1seg were fundamentally the same as those broadcast on the equivalent HDTV channel. On April 1 the regulation was revised, and experimental programs by 1seg or third parties have begun airing on several stations. On January 16, 2008, JEITA released their monthly shipping survey showing approx. 4.806 million mobile phones were sold in Japan in November 2007. Of these, approx. 3.054 million phones, 63.5% of the total, can receive 1seg broadcasts.Source; the article of Yomiuri Shimbun 2008-01-16, area version 13S page 8, and (Japanese language);2007 fiscal year monthly base shipment quantity (2007年度移動電話国内出荷実績、ワンセグ搭載比率（%）) In the fiscal year of 2007, on average 45% of mobile phones had 1seg reception capability out of the 22.284 million units sold.

The refinery is situated on the south bank of the Manchester Ship Canal, which is used to transport seaborne oil for refining and chemicals for Essar and Shell. Stanlow has a refining capacity of 12 million tonnes per year with a barrel per day capacity of 296,000. Consequently, it is the second largest in the United Kingdom after Fawley Refinery,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/essar-energy- acquires-shell-s-stanlow-refinery-for-350-mn-111032900204_1.html and produces a sixth of the UK's petrol needs. Stanlow is also a large producer for commodities such as jet fuel and diesel. Although situated in North West England, the refinery serves much of England as it is linked to the UK oil pipeline network. Oil is delivered to the Tranmere Oil Terminal via ship, then pumped to Stanlow for refining and stored for delivery. History Stanlow Oil Refinery from the air The refinery occupies nearly near the River Mersey and dates back to 1924, when a small bitumen plant was established. Stanlow and Thornton railway station was opened in 1940 to give workers access to the site and the facility an extra mode of transport. However, this station is now only served by three trains daily towards each of Ellesmere Port (westbound) and Helsby (eastbound), with these services scheduled to depart at times which would be inconvenient for the workers. In the 1974 an oil pipeline was commissioned from Amlwch, Anglesey to Stanlow. Crude oil was pumped ashore from tankers moored at deep-water pontoons to a holding station at Rhosgoch, from there it was pumped through two 36-inch diameter pipelines, 127 km to Stanlow. The pipeline had closed by 1990. Crude oil is now received lower down river on the Mersey at the Tranmere Oil Terminal, operated by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company from its Liverpool headquarters, and is transferred via a fifteen-mile (24 km) pipeline to storage at Stanlow. Output is delivered via various means, including by pipeline via the UK oil pipeline network, road and the Manchester Ship Canal. There is also a pipeline for jet fuel to Manchester Airport. In 1969 Shell-Mex and BP Ltd. opened a £3 million joint venture bulk liquid distribution centre at Haydock, Lancashire. This was built on a 90 acre site and was designed to store up to 1 million tonnes of oil. It handled 5,000 tonnes of oil products daily, comprising 22 million gallons (100,000 m3) of white oil and 42 million gallons (191,000 m3) of black oil a year. The terminal was supplied with light oils via a 41.6 km pipeline from Stanlow refinery; heavy oils were delivered by two trains per day from Stanlow, and three daily trains from Heysham refinery. Oil products were loaded into a fleet of 100 road tankers for distribution. In 2010, Royal Dutch Shell declared their desire to sell off some refineries in Europe to concentrate on emerging markets in Asia and the Middle East, which led to the possibility that Stanlow would be shut down indefinitely. However, Shell said that a number of refineries in their portfolio offered over-capacity and consequently Stanlow, their last British refinery, was put up for sale. After a prolonged period of negotiation, Stanlow was sold by Shell to Essar Energy for approximately $1.3 billion (£814 million) in 2011. Essar has stated their desire to expand the site with a 25% increase in output. Following the bankruptcy of Petroplus which ran the Coryton Refinery in January 2012, Essar stated their belief that Stanlow, being a large refinery, would be able to compete with refineries in Asia and the Middle East. Essar plan a £250 million expansion of Stanlow, with production of diesel and aviation fuel to be increased. Protests Stanlow's position as one of the largest and well- known refineries in the country, has led to numerous protests over a number of decades. In the UK fuel crisis of 2000, protests over government taxation on fuel began at Stanlow. A large fuel price protest was staged in May 2011 with the objective of \\"shutting down\\" the refinery.

A New South Wales State of Origin representative , he played in the National Rugby League for the South Sydney Rabbitohs, with whom he won the 2014 NRL Premiership, and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. Merritt has also played representative football for the City New South Wales, Indigenous All Stars and Prime Minister's XIII sides. A prolific try-scorer, he was the NRL's top try-scorer in 2006 and 2011, and in 2013 became the 9th player in the history of the League to score 150 tries. Background Born in Sydney, Merritt is an Indigenous Australian who grew up on The Block in Redfern, South Sydney. He played his early football in the South Sydney Juniors competition for the Alexandria Rovers. Professional playing career =2000s= His first-grade debut was for the South Sydney Rabbitohs against the New Zealand Warriors at Ericsson Stadium in round 9 of the 2002 NRL season, scoring a try on debut. At the end of the 2003 season Merritt agreed to terms with the Cronulla Sharks where he was to play for the next two years. In the 2005 season, Merritt endured a tough year. He played only three first grade games for the Sharks, but was a stand-out player in the lower grade NSWRL Premier League matches for the Newtown Jets, scoring almost 300 points for the year. In one game against the Windsor Wolves, he scored 40 points (including 5 tries). At the end of the season, Merritt picked up a number of awards including Newtown RLFC VB Premier League Players' Player award, as well as having the distinction of being the Jets highest season point scorer, as well as most points in a game.http://www.newtownjets.com.au/2007-news/2005AwardsNight.php (as of 2005). His outstanding showing that year was rewarded when his old club South Sydney offered him a two-year contract to play in the NRL. For the 2006 NRL season, Merritt rejoined the Rabbitohs and was a standout performer in an underachieving side all year, being one of only three players to play all 24 games for the club. He was the highest try scorer for the 2006 season with 22 tries, beating Manly Sea Eagles' fullback Brett Stewart who scored 20. It was the first time since Nathan Blacklock in 2000 that the leading try scorer in a season played for a club that missed the finals, and the first time in Australian rugby league history that the leading try scorer in a season played for the club that finished last on the competition ladder. Notably, in the first three rounds of the season Merritt scored a try in the final minute of each game, a feat that had never been achieved in three consecutive games. Nathan's hard work and great performances through the year culminated in the announcement that he had earned his first representative honor, to play for the Prime Minister's XIII on their annual end of season tour to Papua New Guinea, the only South Sydney player to make in the squad. The Australians beat the Papua New Guinea Kumuls 28–8, with Merritt one of the try-scorers. He was also included in the train-on squad for the Kangaroos squad for the 2006 Tri-Nations tournament against England and New Zealand, but missed out on a starting position. Merritt representing the Rabbitohs in the USA in 2008 Merrit playing for the North Sydney Bears in 2012 Following the announcement of the City Origin squad in 2007, Merritt hinted that his non-selection was possibly due to \\"a Souths thing or a racial thing\\". This comment was lambasted and in rebuttal to this comment critics pointed to the selection of Parramatta's Jarryd Hayne (Fiji) and Canterbury-Bankstown's Hazem El Masri (Lebanon) as evidence that selections had not been racially motivated.Merritt questions rep snub foxsports.com.au Retrieved on 1 May 2007. The Rabbitohs eventually made the finals for the first time since 1989 but Merritt was injured in the second-last round of the competition so was unable to play in the match they ultimately lost to Manly-Warringah. Merritt scored a hat-trick to begin the 2009 season against the Roosters in a match the Rabbitohs won 52–12. In round 10 Merritt was responsible for one of the most iconic moments in modern rugby league. With less than 10 seconds left in the Heritage Round match against the Wests Tigers at the Rugby League's spiritual home of the SCG he kicked a field goal to win the game for the Rabbitohs, 23–22. This was the only field goal he ever kicked in his career. The fact the Rabbitohs came from 12 points behind late in the game, it was Heritage Round, the game was at the SCG, it was in the final moments in the game and he had never kicked a field goal all contributed to the aura surrounding this moment and the legacy it has produced. At the 2009 Dally M Awards, he was awarded the Peter Frilingos Memorial Award for Headline Moment of the Year for the field goal. Merritt's great experiences at the SCG continued in 2010 when he scored a hat-trick, once again against the Wests Tigers in Heritage Round. =2010s= On 8 August 2011 Merritt equalled the South Sydney club record of 5 tries in a match when he scored five against the Parramatta at ANZ Stadium in a 56–6 win, joining greats such as Harold Horder, Johnny Graves and Ian Moir to have scored five tries in a match for the Rabbitohs. He followed this up just six days later with a three try performance against the Canberra Raiders at Canberra Stadium and in doing so he became the first player since former Raiders fullback Brett Mullins in 1994 to score eight tries within eight days in the NRL. Merritt's haul also saw him become clear leading try scorer for the 2011 NRL season with 21 from 21 games, six tries more than Canterbury's Ben Barba with four rounds left to play before the Finals. After the regular season Merritt finished on 23 tries for the year [equal with Barba], a personal best with his previous best being 22 in 2006. After his brilliant form in 2011, Merritt was again selected to play for the Prime Minister's XIII against Papua New Guinea. During the 2012 All Stars Match Merritt scored 2 tries and was awarded the Preston Campbell Medal for Man of the Match. At the end of the 2012 season in which he crossed for 14 tries in 19 games to be the Rabbitohs second highest try scorer behind rookie winger Andrew Everingham (17 from 25 games). This ended Merritt's streak of being the Rabbitohs' top try-scorer for the season which extended back to 2006. He finally played in his first finals match, in the first week of the finals against the Melbourne Storm at AAMi Park. Although the Rabbitohs lost, they played in the next week of the finals, however Merritt injured himself in the lead-up to the game and was not able play in the Rabbitohs' first finals victory in 24 years. Merritt was included in the Australian train-on squad for the end of season test against New Zealand in Townsville, but once again he was not one of the 17 selected for the match. On 18 June 2013 Nathan Merritt was selected to make his State of Origin debut for NSW in Game 2 of the 2013 State of Origin series following the suspension of Blake Ferguson. His performance was widely criticised and he was dropped for the following game, never to play for NSW again. The Rabbitohs made the finals for the second consecutive year and Merritt played in their victory against the Storm, marking the first and only finals win of his career. He scored a try in the Rabbitohs' following game which they lost to Manly, meaning they failed to make the Grand Final. On 27 September 2013, Merritt equaled Benny Wearing's record for the most number of tries scored (144) by an individual while playing for the South Sydney Rabbitohs, and broke this record with his 145th try, scoring against Penrith at Centrebet Stadium on 11 April 2014. Merritt was dropped for the Rabbitohs' 2014 ANZAC Day match against the Broncos at Suncorp Stadium. His replacement, Alex Johnston, cemented his spot in the Rabbitohs' team and Merritt only played intermittently for the remainder of the season. On 24 September 2014 Merritt announced his retirement from rugby league after showing lacklustre performance in both the NRL and NSW Cup competitions. He finished his career as the highest South Sydney try-scorer and the second most games played for the club in a history stretching back to 1908. Despite being part of the 2014 Rabbitohs squad, he did not attend the Grand Final, which Souths went on to win, instead choosing to play in the annual Koori Knockout. Outside rugby league In 2007, Merritt, along with then-Sydney Roosters star Amos Roberts, appeared in the rap music video for Anthony Mundine's \\"Platinum Ryder\\" single. US hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg - said to be a Rabbitohs fan - has reportedly named Merritt as his favorite NRL player. At the press conference announcing his retirement, Merritt announced he was beginning a charity called the Nathan Merritt Foundation aimed at helping youths in Redfern.

They are formally trained and admitted to office, but they remain part of the laity, not of the clergy. History =Ancient office of Reader= From the third century the office of reader (or lector) became recognised as one of the minor orders of the clerical state. Candidates for ordained ministry (as deacons and priests) were first admitted to the sequence of minor orders, including that of lector or reader. The minor orders have been largely absent from the Anglican Church since the Reformation (with some localised exceptions) and in the Roman Catholic Church they have also been suppressed. However, the \\"ministry of reader\\" (in the Roman Catholic Church) and the office of reader or lay reader (in the Anglican Church) represent a continuation of the reader tradition. =Modern revival= The office of Reader has existed in its present form since 1866. Reader ministry was originally restricted to men only. The first female readers were licensed during the First World War due to the shortage of men. The first group of women admitted were called \\"bishop's messengers\\" and they existed in 22 dioceses in England and one diocese in Canada. After the war there was a gap until 1969 when more female readers were appointed. There are now many thousands of readers in the Anglican church, including around ten thousand in the Church of England, and around 300 in the Church of Ireland. They are equally split between women and men. =Relationship to Holy Orders= In the Roman Catholic Church, candidates for ordination as a deacon must first have been admitted to the ministry of reader (Canon 1035). Whilst Anglican canon law has no such requirement, the Canons of some provinces of the Anglican Communion allow for ordination candidates to be admitted as readers as part of their preparation for ordination as a deacon; this practice is common, for example, in the Anglican Church of Ireland where ordination candidates so admitted are known as Student Readers; the Student Reader's licence permits them to serve in any diocese rather than being bound (as in the case of diocesan readers) solely to the diocese of their licensing bishop. Title The terms \\"reader\\" and \\"lay reader\\" are largely interchangeable in common use. The original term in the Church of England was simply \\"reader\\", but \\"lay reader\\" is an early and common colloquialism, which has come to have official force in some parts of the Anglican Communion. In the Church of England the governing Canon E5 still references the office by the single word \\"Reader\\". In the Scottish Episcopal Church the governing Canon 20 always refers to the office by the two-word term \\"Lay Reader\\". In the Church of Ireland the generic term used is \\"Reader\\", but usually qualified as \\"Student Reader\\" for those admitted as part of their preparation for ordination (see above) or \\"Diocesan Reader\\" for those not seeking subsequent ordination. Following a Church of England working party report to the General Synod in 2009 most English dioceses have adopted the title Licensed Lay Minister (Reader), or LLM (Reader). Admission Following training (usually over several years) a candidate is publicly admitted as a lay reader by the bishop. Standards of training and forms of admission are regulated by the Anglican Consultative Council and by the Canons of each province. Lay readers are usually admitted during a celebration of the eucharist. As part of the rite they are presented with a copy of the New Testament (CofE Canon E5[5]) and a certificate of admission to the office of reader (CofE Canon E5[6]). In most provinces they are also clothed with a blue tippet over their cassock and surplice. Admission as a lay reader is a once-only and permanent rite. Lay readers must be re- licensed if they move between parishes or dioceses (CofE Canon E6), but they are not again admitted to the office of reader, as their original admission is a permanent act (CofE Canon E5[6]). Role and duties Anglican lay readers are licensed by the bishop to a particular parish or to the diocese at large. The vast majority of lay readers are volunteers, although a small number are stipendiary ministers (paid to work full time), and the Canons of the Church of England make provision for the terms of employment and service of a stipendiary reader. The role, whose prominence varies by region, bears many similarities to both the traditional liturgical role of Reader in the historic catholic rites of the church, and the role of lay preacher found in many non- conformist denominations. The role can involve: *Conducting the Daily Office (Mattins, Evensong, Compline) or other non-sacramental services *Reciting the Litany *Publishing banns of marriage *Preaching, teaching, and assisting in pastoral care *Distributing (though not presiding at) Holy Communion. *Participation at other services as requested by their incumbent *In some cases the role may include conducting funerals In many parishes a lay reader may carry out liturgical functions at the eucharist similar to the role of the liturgical deacon; in parishes of anglo-catholic tradition, a lay reader may vest and act as subdeacon at solemn mass. Many of these duties can be performed by any reasonably competent lay person who has been properly instructed, but a lay reader is licensed to perform them as part of a wider leadership role, following extensive training. This training and licensing elevates the reader to a particular ministerial role and function recognised as being distinct from the parish-based lay leadership of local congregational volunteers. Their theological training enables them to preach, teach, and lead worship, and they are also able to assist in pastoral, evangelistic and liturgical work. Training Training to become a reader is rigorous and follows a period of testing and preparation. In many dioceses this involves some form of access training that introduces the concept of theological reflection as well as the nature of ministry. All potential readers attend a diocesan advisory panel to test their calling and assess their suitability for the role. The recommendations from this are fed to the parochial church council (PCC) in the candidate's own parish, which must confirm that it will support the candidate during training and will agree to the candidate going forward for licensing. Training takes place over one to three years (depending on prior theological training) at a local theological college and is often shared with ordinands and those preparing for other types of ministry. Reader training in the Church of England is overseen by the University of Durham and most candidates study for a CertEd or diploma in theology. All readers will have a working agreement in place which is agreed with their incumbent. This outlines their duties and aims to promote a balance between their work and family commitments. Candidates may undergo a placement in a parish other than their home parish to gain broader experience. Reader training usually incorporates a selection of the following and this can vary across training colleges * Old Testament * New Testament * Christian theology * Liturgy and worship * Pastoral care * Study of local context * Mission * Spirituality * Ethics * The nature of Christian salvation * Church history * Leadership skills and self-awareness (usually a Myers Briggs workshop) * Ministry to the dying and bereaved * Preaching skills On top of this there are practical skills that are learnt within the home parish such as leading worship and preaching. At the end of training the PCC has to agree to the candidate going forward for licensing. The candidate is licensed as well as admitted to the Order of Readers at a service in their local cathedral. The following day their licence is read in their home church and the new reader preaches at that service.

There are two key aspects to effective neutron detection: hardware and software. Detection hardware refers to the kind of neutron detector used (the most common today is the scintillation detector) and to the electronics used in the detection setup. Further, the hardware setup also defines key experimental parameters, such as source-detector distance, solid angle and detector shielding. Detection software consists of analysis tools that perform tasks such as graphical analysis to measure the number and energies of neutrons striking the detector. Basic physics =Signatures by which a neutron may be detected= Atomic and subatomic particles are detected by the signature they produce through interaction with their surroundings. The interactions result from the particles' fundamental characteristics. * Charge: Neutrons are neutral particles and do not ionize directly; hence they are harder than charged particles to detect directly. Further, their paths of motion are only weakly affected by electric and magnetic fields. * Mass: The neutron mass of Particle Data Group's Review of Particle Physics 2006 is not directly detectable, but does influence reactions through which it can be detected. * Reactions: Neutrons react with a number of materials through elastic scattering producing a recoiling nucleus, inelastic scattering producing an excited nucleus, or absorption with transmutation of the resulting nucleus. Most detection approaches rely on detecting the various reaction products. * Magnetic moment: Although neutrons have a magnetic moment of μN, techniques for detection of the magnetic moment are too insensitive to use for neutron detection. * Electric dipole moment: The neutron is predicted to have only a tiny electric dipole moment, which has not yet been detected. Hence it is not a viable detection signature. * Decay: Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of (about 14 minutes, 46 seconds). Free neutrons decay by emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino to become a proton, a process known as beta decay:Particle Data Group Summary Data Table on Baryons ::: → + + . :Although the and produced by neutron decay are detectable, the decay rate is too low to serve as the basis for a practical detector system. =Classic neutron detection options= As a result of these properties, detection of neutrons fall into several major categories: * Absorptive reactions with prompt reactions - low energy neutrons are typically detected indirectly through absorption reactions. Typical absorber materials used have high cross sections for absorption of neutrons and include helium-3, lithium-6, boron-10, and uranium-235. Each of these reacts by emission of high energy ionized particles, the ionization track of which can be detected by a number of means. Commonly used reactions include 3He(n,p) 3H, 6Li(n,t) 4He, 10B(n,α) 7Li and the fission of uranium. * Activation processes - Neutrons may be detected by reacting with absorbers in a radiative capture, spallation or similar reaction, producing reaction products that then decay at some later time, releasing beta particles or gammas. Selected materials (e.g., indium, gold, rhodium, iron (56Fe(n,p) 56Mn), aluminum (27Al(n,α)24Na), niobium (93Nb(n,2n) 92mNb), & silicon (28Si(n,p) 28Al)) have extremely large cross sections for the capture of neutrons within a very narrow band of energy. Use of multiple absorber samples allows characterization of the neutron energy spectrum. Activation also allows recreation of an historic neutron exposure (e.g., forensic recreation of neutron exposures during an accidental criticality). * Elastic scattering reactions (also referred to as proton-recoil) - High energy neutrons are typically detected indirectly through elastic scattering reactions. Neutrons collide with the nuclei of atoms in the detector, transferring energy to those nuclei and creating ions, which are detected. Since the maximum transfer of energy occurs when the mass of the atom with which the neutron collides is comparable to the neutron mass, hydrogenousMaterials with a high hydrogen content such as water or plastic materials are often the preferred medium for such detectors. Types of neutron detectors =Gas proportional detectors= Gas proportional detectors can be adapted to detect neutrons. While neutrons do not typically cause ionization, the addition of a nuclide with high neutron cross-section allows the detector to respond to neutrons. Nuclides commonly used for this purpose are helium-3, lithium-6, boron-10 and uranium-235. Since these materials are most likely to react with thermal neutrons (i.e., neutrons that have slowed to equilibrium with their surroundings), they are typically surrounded by moderating materials to reduce their energy and increase the likelihood of detection. Further refinements are usually necessary to differentiate the neutron signal from the effects of other types of radiation. Since the energy of a thermal neutron is relatively low, charged particle reactions are discrete (i.e., essentially monoenergetic and lie within a narrow bandwidth of energies) while other reactions such as gamma reactions will span a broad energy range, it is possible to discriminate among the sources. As a class, gas ionization detectors measure the number (count rate), and not the energy of neutrons. 3He gas-filled proportional detectors An isotope of Helium, 3He provides for an effective neutron detector material because 3He reacts by absorbing thermal neutrons, producing a 1H and 3H ion. Its sensitivity to gamma rays is negligible, providing a very useful neutron detector. Unfortunately the supply of 3He is limited to production as a byproduct from the decay of tritium (which has a 12.3 year half-life); tritium is produced either as part of weapons programs as a booster for nuclear weapons or as a byproduct of reactor operation. BF3 gas-filled proportional detectors As elemental boron is not gaseous, neutron detectors containing boron may alternately use boron trifluoride (BF3) enriched to 96% boron-10 (natural boron is 20% 10B, 80% 11B).Boron Trifluoride (BF3) Neutron Detectors Boron trifluoride is highly toxic. The sensitivity of this detector is around 35-40 CPS/nv whereas that of Boron lined is about 4 CPS/nv. This is because in Boron lined, n reacts with Boron and hence produce ion pairs inside the layer. Hence charged particles produced (Alpha and Li) they lose some of their energy inside that layer. Low energy charged particles are unable to reach the Ionization chamber's gas environment. Hence, the number of ionizations produced in gas is also lower. Whereas In BF3 gas filled, N reacts with B in gas. and fully energetic Alpha and Li are able to produce more ionizations and give more pulses. Boron lined proportional detectors Alternately, boron-lined gas-filled proportional counters react similarly to BF3 gas-filled proportional detectors, with the exception that the walls are coated with 10B. In this design, since the reaction takes place on the surface, only one of the two particles will escape into the proportional counter. =Scintillation neutron detectors= Scintillation neutron detectors include liquid organic scintillators, crystals,Example crystal scintillator based neutron monitor. plastics, glass and scintillation fibers. Neutron-sensitive scintillating glass fiber detectors Scintillating 6Li glass for neutron detection was first reported in the scientific literature in 1957 and key advances were made in the 1960s and 1970s. Scintillating fiber was demonstrated by Atkinson M. et al. in 1987 and major advances were made in the late 1980s and early 1990s at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory where it was developed as a classified technology. It was declassified in 1994 and first licensed by Oxford Instruments in 1997, followed by a transfer to Nucsafe in 1999. The fiber and fiber detectors are now manufactured and sold commercially by Nucsafe, Inc.Nucsafe Inc. website The scintillating glass fibers work by incorporating 6Li and Ce3+ into the glass bulk composition. The 6Li has a high cross-section for thermal neutron absorption through the 6Li(n,α) reaction. Neutron absorption produces a tritium ion, an alpha particle, and kinetic energy. The alpha particle and triton interact with the glass matrix to produce ionization, which transfers energy to Ce3+ ions and results in the emission of photons with wavelength 390 nm - 600 nm as the excited state Ce3+ ions return to the ground state. The event results in a flash of light of several thousand photons for each neutron absorbed. A portion of the scintillation light propagates through the glass fiber, which acts as a waveguide. The fibers ends are optically coupled to a pair of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect photon bursts. The detectors can be used to detect both neutrons and gamma rays, which are typically distinguished using pulse-height discrimination. Substantial effort and progress in reducing fiber detector sensitivity to gamma radiation has been made. Original detectors suffered from false neutrons in a 0.02 mR gamma field. Design, process, and algorithm improvements now enable operation in gamma fields up to 20 mR/h (60Co). The scintillating fiber detectors have excellent sensitivity, they are rugged, and have fast timing (~60 ns) so that a large dynamic range in counting rates is possible. The detectors have the advantage that they can be formed into any desired shape, and can be made very large or very small for use in a variety of applications. Further, they do not rely on 3He or any raw material that has limited availability, nor do they contain toxic or regulated materials. Their performance matches or exceeds that of 3He tubes for gross neutron counting due to the higher density of neutron absorbing species in the solid glass compared to high-pressure gaseous 3He. Even though the thermal neutron cross section of 6Li is low compared to 3He (940 barns vs. 5330 barns), the atom density of 6Li in the fiber is fifty times greater, resulting in an advantage in effective capture density ratio of approximately 10:1. LiCaAlF6 LiCaAlF6 is a neutron sensitive inorganic scintillator crystal which like neutron-sensitive scintillating glass fiber detectors makes use of neutron capture by 6Li. Unlike scintillating glass fiber detectors however the 6Li is part of the crystalline structure of the scintillator giving it a naturally high 6Li density. A doping agent is added to provide the crystal with its scintillating properties, two common doping agents are trivalent cerium and divalent europium. Europium doped LiCaAlF6 has the advantage over other materials that the number of optical photons produced per neutron capture is around 30.000 which is 5 times higher than for example in neutron-sensitive scintillating glass fibers. This property makes neutron photon discrimination easier. Due to its high 6Li density this material is suitable for producing light weight compact neutron detectors, as a result LiCaAlF6 has been used for neutron detection at high altitudes on balloon missions. The long decay time of Eu2+ doped LiCaAlF6 makes it less suitable for measurements in high radiation environments, the Ce3+ doped variant has a shorter decay time but suffers from a lower light-yield. NaIL Dual Detection Neutron-Gamma Scintillator Sodium Iodide crystal co-doped with Thallium and Lithium [NaI(Tl+Li)] a.k.a. NaIL has the ability to detect Gamma radiation and Thermal Neutrons in a single crystal with exceptional Pulse-shape Discrimination.The use of low 6Li concentrations in NaIL and large thicknesses can achieve the same neutron detection capabilities as 3He or CLYC or CLLB detectors at a lower cost.6Li (95% enriched) co-doping introduces efficient thermal neutron detection to the most established gamma-ray scintillator while retaining the favorable scintillation properties of standard NaI(Tl). NaIL can provide large volume, single material detectors for both gammas and neutrons at a low price per volume.Large Format Li Co-doped NaI:Tl Scintilation Detector for Gamma-ray and Neutron Dual Detection, 2017 Technical Paper.Li co-doped NaI:Tl (NaIL) − A Large Volume Neutron-Gamma Scintillator with Exceptional Pulse Shape Discrimination 2017 IEEE Presentation.Example Gamma-Neutron Dual detector. =Semiconductor neutron detectors= There are two basic types of semiconductor neutron detectors, the first being electron devices coated with a neutron reactive material and the second being a semiconductor being partly composed of neutron reactive material. The most successful of these configurations is the coated device type, and an example would be a common planar Si diode coated with either 10B or 6LiF. This type of detector was first proposed by Babcock et al. The concept is straightforward. A neutron is absorbed in the reactive film and spontaneously emits energetic reaction products. A reaction product may reach the semiconductor surface, and upon entering the semiconductor produces electron-hole pairs. Under a reverse bias voltage, these electrons and holes are drifted through the diode to produce an induced current, usually integrated in pulse mode to form a voltage output. The maximum intrinsic efficiency for single-coated devices is approximately 5% for thermal neutrons (0.0259 eV), and the design and operation are thoroughly described in the literature. The neutron detection efficiency limitation is a consequence of reaction-product self-absorption. For instance, the range in a boron film of 1.47 MeV α particles from the 10B(n,α) 7Li reaction is approximately 4.5 microns, and the range in LiF of 2.7 MeV tritons from the 10B(n,α) 7Li reaction is approximately 28 microns. Reaction products originating at distances further from the film/semiconductor interface can not reach the semiconductor surface, and consequently will not contribute to neutron detection. Devices coated with natural Gd have also been explored, mainly because of its large thermal neutron microscopic cross section of 49,000 barns. However, the Gd(n,γ) reaction products of interest are mainly low energy conversion electrons, mostly grouped around 70 keV. Consequently, discrimination between neutron induced events and gamma-ray events (mainly producing Compton scattered electrons) is difficult for Gd-coated semiconductor diodes. A compensated pixel design sought to remedy the problem. Overall, devices coated with either 10B or 6LiF are preferred mainly because the energetic charged-particle reaction products are much easier to discriminate from background radiations. The low efficiency of coated planar diodes led to the development of microstructured semiconductor neutron detectors (MSND). These detectors have microscopic structures etched into a semiconductor substrate, subsequently formed into a pin style diode. The microstructures are backfilled with neutron reactive material, usually 6LiF, although 10B has been used. The increased semiconductor surface area adjacent to the reactive material and the increased probability that a reaction product will enter the semiconductor greatly increase the intrinsic neutron detection efficiency. thumbBasic design of a microstructured semiconductor neutron detector (MSND). The MSND device configuration was first proposed by Muminov and Tsvang, and later by Schelten et al. It was years later when the first working example of a MSND was fabricated and demonstrated , then having only 3.3% thermal neutron detection efficiency. Since that initial work, MSNDs have achieved greater than 30% thermal neutron detection efficiency. Although MSNDs can operate on the built-in potential (zero applied voltage), they perform best when 2-3 volts are applied. There are several groups now working on MSND variations. The most successful types are the variety backfilled with 6LiF material. MSNDs are now manufactured and sold commercially by Radiation Detection Technologies, Inc.RDT, Inc. website Advanced experimental versions of double-sided MSNDs with opposing microstructures on both sides of a semiconductor wafer have been reported with over 50% thermal neutron detection efficiency, and are theoretically capable of over 70% efficiency. Semiconductor detectors in which one of more constituent atoms are neutron reactive are called bulk semiconductor neutron detectors. Bulk solid-state neutron detectors can be divided into two basic categories: those that rely on the detection of charged-particle reaction products and those that rely on the detection of prompt capture gamma rays. In general, this type of neutron detector is difficult to make reliably and presently are not commercially available. The bulk materials that rely upon charged-particle emissions are based on boron and lithium containing semiconductors. In the search for bulk semiconductor neutron detectors, the boron-based materials, such as BP, BAs, BN, and B4C, have been investigated more than other potential materials. Boron-based semiconductors in cubic form are difficult to grow as bulk crystals, mainly because they require high temperatures and high pressure for synthesis. BP and Bas can decompose into undesirable crystal structures (cubic to icosahedral form) unless synthesized under high pressure. B4C also forms icosahedral units in a rhombohedral crystal structure, an undesirable transformation because the icosahedral structure has relatively poor charge collection properties which make these icosahedral forms unsuitable for neutron detection. BN can be formed as either simple hexagonal, cubic (zincblende) or wurtzite crystals, depending on the growth temperature, and it is usually grown by thin film methods. It is the simple hexagonal form of BN that has been most studied as a neutron detector. Thin film chemical vapor deposition methods are usually employed to produce BP, BAs, BN, or B4C. These boron-based films are often grown upon n-type Si substrates, which can form a pn junction with the Si and, therefore, produce a coated Si diode as described at the beginning of this section. Consequently, the neutron response from the device can be easily mistaken as a bulk response when it is actually a coated diode response. To date, there is sparse evidence of boron-based semiconductors producing intrinsic neutron signals. Li-containing semiconductors, categorized as Nowotny-Juza compounds, have also been investigated as bulk neutron detectors. The Nowotny-Juza compound LiZnAs has been demonstrated as a neutron detector; however, the material is difficult and expensive to synthesize, and only small semiconductor crystals have been reported. Finally, traditional semiconductor materials with neutron reactive dopants have been investigated, namely, Si(Li) detectors. Neutrons interact with the lithium dopant in the material and produce energetic reaction products. However, the dopant concentration is relatively low in Li drifted Si detectors (or other doped semiconductors), typically less than 1019 cm−3. For a degenerate concentration of Li on the order of 1019 cm−3, a 5-cm thick block of natural Si(Li) would have less than 1% thermal-neutron detection efficiency, while a 5-cm thick block of a Si(6Li) detector would have only 4.6% thermal-neutron detection efficiency. Prompt gamma-ray emitting semiconductors, such as CdTe, and HgI2 have been successfully used as neutron detectors. These detectors rely upon the prompt gamma-ray emissions from the 113Cd(n, γ)114Cd reaction (producing 558.6 keV and 651.3 keV gamma rays) and the 199Hg(n, γ) 200Hg reaction (producing 368.1 keV and 661.1 keV gamma rays). However, these semiconductor materials are designed for use as gamma-ray spectrometers and, hence, are intrinsically sensitive to the gamma-ray background. With adequate energy resolution, pulse height discrimination can be used to separate the prompt gamma-ray emissions from neutron interactions. However, the effective neutron detection efficiency is compromised because of the relatively small Compton ratio. In other words, the majority of events add to the Compton continuum rather than to the full energy peak, thus, making discrimination between neutrons and background gamma rays difficult. Also, both natural Cd and Hg have relatively large thermal-neutron (n,γ) cross sections of 2444 b and 369.8 b, respectively. Consequently, most thermal neutrons are absorbed near the detector surface so that nearly half of the prompt gamma rays are emitted in directions away from the detector bulk and, thus, produce poor gamma-ray reabsorption or interaction efficiency. =Neutron activation detectors= Activation samples may be placed in a neutron field to characterize the energy spectrum and intensity of the neutrons. Activation reactions that have differing energy thresholds can be used including 56Fe(n,p) 56Mn, 27Al(n,α)24Na, 93Nb(n,2n) 92mNb, & 28Si(n,p)28Al. =Fast neutron detectors= Fast neutrons are often detected by first moderating (slowing) them to thermal energies. However, during that process the information on the original energy of the neutron, its direction of travel, and the time of emission is lost. For many applications, the detection of “fast” neutrons that retain this information is highly desirable. Typical fast neutron detectors are liquid scintillators, 4-He based noble gas detectors and plastic detectors. Fast neutron detectors differentiate themselves from one another by their 1.) capability of neutron/gamma discrimination (through pulse shape discrimination) and 2.) sensitivity. The capability to distinguish between neutrons and gammas is excellent in noble gas based 4-He detectors due to their low electron density and excellent pulse shape discrimination property. In fact, inorganic scintillators such as zinc sulfide has been shown to exhibit large differences in their decay times for protons and electrons; a feature that has been exploited by combining the inorganic crystal with a neutron converter (such as polymethyl methacrylate) in the Micro-Layered Fast-Neutron Detector . Such detection systems are capable of selectively detecting only fast neutrons in a mixed neutron-gamma radiation field without requiring any additional discrimination techniques such as pulse shape discrimination . Detection of fast neutrons poses a range of special problems. A directional fast-neutron detector has been developed using multiple proton recoils in separated planes of plastic scintillator material. The paths of the recoil nuclei created by neutron collision are recorded; determination of the energy and momentum of two recoil nuclei allow calculation of the direction of travel and energy of the neutron that underwent elastic scattering with them. Applications Neutron detection is used for varying purposes. Each application has different requirements for the detection system. * Reactor instrumentation: Since reactor power is essentially linearly proportional to the neutron flux, neutron detectors provide an important measure of power in nuclear power and research reactors. Boiling water reactors may have dozens of neutron detectors, one per fuel assembly. Most neutron detectors used in thermal-spectrum nuclear reactors are optimized to detect thermal neutrons. * Plasma physics: Neutron detection is used in fusion plasma physics experiments such as JET. For example, the detected neutron rate from a plasma can give information about the ion temperature. * Particle physics: Neutron detection has been proposed as a method of enhancing neutrino detectors. * Materials science: Elastic and inelastic neutron scattering enables experimentalists to characterize the morphology of materials from scales ranging from ångströms to about one micrometer. * Radiation safety: Neutron radiation is a hazard associated with neutron sources, space travel, accelerators and nuclear reactors. Neutron detectors used for radiation safety must take into account the relative biological effectiveness (i.e., the way damage caused by neutrons varies with energy). * Cosmic ray detection: Secondary neutrons are one component of particle showers produced in Earth's atmosphere by cosmic rays. Dedicated ground-level neutron detectors, namely neutron monitors, are employed to monitor variations in cosmic ray flux. * Special nuclear material detection: Special nuclear materials (SNM) such as uranium-233 and plutonium-239 decay by spontaneous fission, yielding neutrons. Neutrons detectors can be used for monitor for SNM in commerce. Experimental neutron detection Experiments that make use of this science include scattering experiments in which neutrons directed and then scattered from a sample are to be detected. Facilities include the ISIS neutron source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ) at the Paul Scherrer Institute, in which the neutrons are produced by spallation reaction, and the traditional research reactor facilities in which neutrons are produced during fission of uranium isotopes. Noteworthy among the various neutron detection experiments is the trademark experiment of the European Muon Collaboration, first performed at CERN and now termed the \\"EMC experiment.\\" The same experiment is performed today with more sophisticated equipment to obtain more definite results related to the original EMC effect. =Challenges in neutron detection in an experimental environment= Neutron detection in an experimental environment is not an easy science. The major challenges faced by modern-day neutron detection include background noise, high detection rates, neutron neutrality, and low neutron energies.  Background noise  The main components of background noise in neutron detection are high-energy photons, which aren't easily eliminated by physical barriers. The other sources of noise, such as alpha and beta particles, can be eliminated by various shielding materials, such as lead, plastic, thermo-coal, etc. Thus, photons cause major interference in neutron detection, since it is uncertain if neutrons or photons are being detected by the neutron detector. Both register similar energies after scattering into the detector from the target or ambient light, and are thus hard to distinguish. Coincidence detection can also be used to discriminate real neutron events from photons and other radiation.  High detection rates  If the detector lies in a region of high beam activity, it is hit continuously by neutrons and background noise at overwhelmingly high rates. This obfuscates collected data, since there is extreme overlap in measurement, and separate events are not easily distinguished from each other. Thus, part of the challenge lies in keeping detection rates as low as possible and in designing a detector that can keep up with the high rates to yield coherent data.  Neutrality of neutrons  Neutrons are neutral and thus do not respond to electric fields. This makes it hard to direct their course towards a detector to facilitate detection. Neutrons also do not ionize atoms except by direct collision, so gaseous ionization detectors are ineffective.  Varying behavior with energy  Detectors relying on neutron absorption are generally more sensitive to low-energy thermal neutrons, and are orders of magnitude less sensitive to high-energy neutrons. Scintillation detectors, on the other hand, have trouble registering the impacts of low-energy neutrons. = Experimental setup and method = Figure 1: The experimental setup Figure 1 shows the typical main components of the setup of a neutron detection unit. In principle, the diagram shows the setup as it would be in any modern particle physics lab, but the specifics describe the setup in Jefferson Lab (Newport News, Virginia). In this setup, the incoming particles, comprising neutrons and photons, strike the neutron detector; this is typically a scintillation detector consisting of scintillating material, a waveguide, and a photomultiplier tube (PMT), and will be connected to a data acquisition (DAQ) system to register detection details. The detection signal from the neutron detector is connected to the scaler unit, gated delay unit, trigger unit and the oscilloscope. The scaler unit is merely used to count the number of incoming particles or events. It does so by incrementing its tally of particles every time it detects a surge in the detector signal from the zero- point. There is very little dead time in this unit, implying that no matter how fast particles are coming in, it is very unlikely for this unit to fail to count an event (e.g. incoming particle). The low dead time is due to sophisticated electronics in this unit, which take little time to recover from the relatively easy task of registering a logical high every time an event occurs. The trigger unit coordinates all the electronics of the system and gives a logical high to these units when the whole setup is ready to record an event run. The oscilloscope registers a current pulse with every event. The pulse is merely the ionization current in the detector caused by this event plotted against time. The total energy of the incident particle can be found by integrating this current pulse with respect to time to yield the total charge deposited at the end of the PMT. This integration is carried out in the analog-digital converter (ADC). The total deposited charge is a direct measure of the energy of the ionizing particle (neutron or photon) entering the neutron detector. This signal integration technique is an established method for measuring ionization in the detector in nuclear physics. The ADC has a higher dead time than the oscilloscope, which has limited memory and needs to transfer events quickly to the ADC. Thus, the ADC samples out approximately one in every 30 events from the oscilloscope for analysis. Since the typical event rate is around 106 neutrons every second, this sampling will still accumulate thousands of events every second. =Separating neutrons from photons= The ADC sends its data to a DAQ unit that sorts the data in presentable form for analysis. The key to further analysis lies in the difference between the shape of the photon ionization-current pulse and that of the neutron. The photon pulse is longer at the ends (or \\"tails\\") whereas the neutron pulse is well-centered. This fact can be used to identify incoming neutrons and to count the total rate of incoming neutrons. The steps leading to this separation (those that are usually performed at leading national laboratories, Jefferson Lab specifically among them) are gated pulse extraction and plotting-the-difference.  Gated pulse extraction  Ionization current signals are all pulses with a local peak in between. Using a logical AND gate in continuous time (having a stream of \\"1\\" and \\"0\\" pulses as one input and the current signal as the other), the tail portion of every current pulse signal is extracted. This gated discrimination method is used on a regular basis on liquid scintillators. The gated delay unit is precisely to this end, and makes a delayed copy of the original signal in such a way that its tail section is seen alongside its main section on the oscilloscope screen. After extracting the tail, the usual current integration is carried out on both the tail section and the complete signal. This yields two ionization values for each event, which are stored in the event table in the DAQ system.  Plotting the difference  Figure 2: Expected plot of tail energy against energy in the complete pulse plotted for all event energies. Dots represent number densities of events. In this step lies the crucial point of the analysis: the extracted ionization values are plotted. Specifically, the graph plots energy deposition in the tail against energy deposition in the entire signal for a range of neutron energies. Typically, for a given energy, there are many events with the same tail-energy value. In this case, plotted points are simply made denser with more overlapping dots on the two- dimensional plot, and can thus be used to eyeball the number of events corresponding to each energy-deposition. A considerable random fraction (1/30) of all events is plotted on the graph. If the tail size extracted is a fixed proportion of the total pulse, then there will be two lines on the plot, having different slopes. The line with the greater slope will correspond to photon events and the line with the lesser slope to neutron events. This is precisely because the photon energy deposition current, plotted against time, leaves a longer \\"tail\\" than does the neutron deposition plot, giving the photon tail more proportion of the total energy than neutron tails. The effectiveness of any detection analysis can be seen by its ability to accurately count and separate the number of neutrons and photons striking the detector. Also, the effectiveness of the second and third steps reveals whether event rates in the experiment are manageable. If clear plots can be obtained in the above steps, allowing for easy neutron-photon separation, the detection can be termed effective and the rates manageable. On the other hand, smudging and indistinguishability of data points will not allow for easy separation of events. =Rate control= Detection rates can be kept low in many ways. Sampling of events can be used to choose only a few events for analysis. If the rates are so high that one event cannot be distinguished from another, physical experimental parameters (shielding, detector-target distance, solid-angle, etc.) can be manipulated to give the lowest rates possible and thus distinguishable events. =Finer detection points= It is important here to observe precisely those variables that matter, since there may be false indicators along the way. For example, ionization currents might get periodic high surges, which do not imply high rates but just high energy depositions for stray events. These surges will be tabulated and viewed with cynicism if unjustifiable, especially since there is so much background noise in the setup. One might ask how experimenters can be sure that every current pulse in the oscilloscope corresponds to exactly one event. This is true because the pulse lasts about 50 ns, allowing for a maximum of events every second. This number is much higher than the actual typical rate, which is usually an order of magnitude less, as mentioned above. This means that is it highly unlikely for there to be two particles generating one current pulse. The current pulses last 50 ns each, and start to register the next event after a gap from the previous event. Although sometimes facilitated by higher incoming neutron energies, neutron detection is generally a difficult task, for all the reasons stated earlier. Thus, better scintillator design is also in the foreground and has been the topic of pursuit ever since the invention of scintillation detectors. Scintillation detectors were invented in 1903 by Crookes but were not very efficient until the PMT (photomultiplier tube) was developed by Curran and Baker in 1944. The PMT gives a reliable and efficient method of detection since it multiplies the detection signal tenfold. Even so, scintillation design has room for improvement as do other options for neutron detection besides scintillation.

Fans are encouraged to bring teddy bears or other stuffed toys to the game, and to throw them onto the ice when the home team scores its first goal. The toys are gathered up to be donated as presents to hospitals and charities. In many cases, the players themselves personally donate some of the bears to children at area hospitals. The Hershey Bears claim a world record of 45,650 stuffed toys in a single game. History The concept originated with the Kamloops Blazers in 1993, thanks to marketing director Don Larson. The first recorded teddy bear toss occurred on December 5, 1993, when a goal by Brad Lukowich prompted fans to throw over 2,400 bears onto the ice. The tradition spread quickly through the Canadian Hockey League, and around the world; excluding the National Hockey League, which discourages anything thrown on the ice. Notable games =In North America= The Calgary Hitmen set a then record of 28,815 stuffed toys in a single game, on December 6, 2015 at the Scotiabank Saddledome, then collected a record of 29,935 stuffed toys in a single game, on December 3, 2018. The annual event has collected almost 350,000 bears in Calgary as of early December 2018. On December 3, 2017, the Hershey Bears collected 25,017 stuffed animals. In the following season, Hershey beat the previous mark by collecting 34,798 stuffed animals on December 2, 2018. The event also inspired philanthropists in Hershey to pledge cash donations per toy collected. On December 1, 2019, the Hershey Bears claimed a world record of 45,650 stuffed toys collected in a single game; tossing and collecting the stuffed animals held up the game for 40 minutes.The toys will be split among 40 central Pennsylvania charities. =Around the world= The teddy bear toss spread to Australia on June 28, 2014 at the Medibank Ice house in Melbourne. The Melbourne Ice collected 306 toys as part of the Canada Day celebration events. On December 27, 2017 Luleå HF brought the tradition to Sweden, with a 3–1 over Mora IK. Bears were donated to a hospital in Södra Sunderbyn, the Woman's Journal in Lulea, and other charities. Other sports The teddy bear toss spread to Italian basketball and made its Lega Basket Serie A debut in 2014. Australian soccer team Newcastle Jets held its inaugural teddy bear toss in December 2019.

The museum's mission is to preserve the history of the Western Pacific Railroad and is operated by the Feather River Rail Society ,Railinc Corporation, Search MARKs, accessed September 2009 founded in 1983. It is located at a former Western Pacific locomotive facility, adjacent to the Union Pacific's former Western Pacific mainline through the Feather River Canyon.  Overview  Logos of the Western Pacific Railroad and the Feather River Rail Society, operators of the Western Pacific Railroad Museum. =Museum collection= The museum holds in its collection thirty-three Diesel locomotives, one electric locomotive, one steam locomotive (under restoration and on display), eighteen passenger cars (including four from the famous California Zephyr train), numerous freight and maintenance cars and sixteen cabooses. They offer excursions and a \\"Run A Locomotive\\" program during the summer. The WPRM has one of the larger collections of early Diesel era locomotives and freight cars in North America. The museum is often considered to have one of the most complete and historic collections of equipment and materials from a single railroad family. The holdings also include extensive corporate records and images, as well as personal collections from those who worked for the Western Pacific. The WPRM is a \\"hands-on\\" museum that allows visitors to board and explore locomotives and cars in their collection. Among the significant pieces in the WPRM collection are Western Pacific 805-A, an FP7 model passenger locomotive that pulled the California Zephyr; Southern Pacific EMD GP9 #2873, nicknamed \\"the Kodachrome\\" by the volunteers, due to it being painted with the Kodachrome scheme from the failed Santa Fe–Southern Pacific merger; WP 2001, the first GP20 model locomotive (an early turbocharged Diesel); WP 501, an early switch engine and the first Diesel purchased by the Western Pacific; Western Pacific 0-6-0 steam locomotive 165, an oil burning switch engine built by ALCO in 1919; WP 37, a 200-ton rail- mounted crane, two track clearing snowplows (one wedge type and one rotary); and several rare, early 20th century freight cars. Also located at the site are the Portola Diesel Shop, built in 1953, and an interlocking tower from Oakland, California, currently stored unrebuilt. The Western Pacific Hospital, built in 1911 and one of the few remaining railroad hospitals in the country, was part of the museum until it was destroyed in an arson fire on September 7, 2011. The WPRM prides itself on maintaining several of their road Diesels in mainline operating condition and is well known for making occasional movements on Class I railroads using their own historic motive power. =Nearby attractions= The \\"7 Wonders of the Western Pacific Railroad World\\" highlight seven key railfanning locations on the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad in the Feather River Canyon\\" crossing the Sierra Nevada. These sites are west and east of the Museum. Plumas-Eureka State Park is located nearby, as is the Lassen Volcanic National Park. Lake Davis and Frenchman Lake are popular fishing locations within easy driving of the museum. Graeagle, a town to the west of Portola, is home to vacation cabins and several golf courses. =Operating a locomotive= One aspect of the Western Pacific Railroad Museum is its nationally known Run A Locomotive (RAL) program. Except for winter and certain weekends when special events are in progress, the museum provides visitors a chance to be an engineer for an hour. Participants are given on-the-ground instruction, then they get to operate a real locomotive of their choice for an hour. A qualified engineer joins them in the locomotive for oversight and further instruction. This is one of the first programs of its type in the United States. More information can be found at WPLives.org. The program is so popular that it is often reserved months in advance. =Zephyr Project= The Zephyr Project is a program of the Feather River Rail Society to acquire, preserve and restore cars, locomotives, personal stories and artifacts relating to the California Zephyr passenger train.

On August 19, 2010 he lost a battle against Santos FC. Chelsea wanted his client, Neymar, but the player did not accept the offer made by Chelsea, and continued to play for Santos FC, with a new contract. High-profile clients apart, Ribeiro is known for his controversial statements regarding players and teams. His penchant for making controversial statements was seen most recently when, after the sacking of Luxemburgo, Ribeiro laid into Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez for what he claimed was an \\"unbalanced squad\\". Ribeiro also famously claimed that some of Real Madrid's Spanish players, namely Raúl, Guti and Iván Helguera did not get along with Real Madrid's growing contingent of Brazilian players. His words created a minor crisis at the club, with both fans and the press alike wondering if a lack of team spirit in Real Madrid's dressing room was the cause for their poor form. The crisis subsided to an extent when one of the players Ribeiro named, Iván Helguera, came out to strongly deny his claims. On 14 July 2014, the same day that Brazil's manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari was sacked or resigned, Ribeiro was reported as describing in detail to the media what he regarded as Scolari's very poor coaching career around the world, and ended by calling Scolari \\"an old jerk, arrogant, repulsive, conceited and ridiculous\\".

Created by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka from 1887 through 1936 at their studio in Hosterwitz, near Dresden, Germany, the collection was commissioned by George Lincoln Goodale, the first director of Harvard's Botanical Museum, and was financed by Mary Lee Ware and her mother Elizabeth C.

The collection comprises approximately 4,400 individual glass models representing over 830 plant species. Background Rudolf (standing) and Leopold Blaschka Starting in 1863 the Blaschkas had a thriving business making glass models of marine invertebrates, selling them to museums and private collectors in a global enterprise (see ).http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/10/exhibition- talk-film-explore-sea-glass Then, in 1886, the Blaschkas were approached by Professor Goodale who, after seeing their work, had gone to Dresden to ask them to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard; the reason for the request being that only used method at time was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled specimens—a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color, two drawbacks which glass models did not have.http://hmnh.harvard.edu/glass- flowershttp://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir- pdfs/goodale-george.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir Leopold was hesitant but eventually agreed to make some sample models which, though badly damaged in customs,http://www.cmog.org/article/glass-flowers convinced Goodale of their value in botanical teaching. To fund the project Goodale approached his former student Mary Lee Ware and her mother, Elizabeth C. Ware, who were already liberal benefactors of Harvard's botanical department.Flowers that never fade / Franklin Baldwin Wiley. Boston Bradlee Whidden, Publisher 1897 The original arrangement (in 1887) provided that the Blaschkas would work half time on the project, but in 1890 a new arrangement called for them to work full-time.Schultes, Richard Evans., William A.

The collection is formally dedicated to Dr. Charles Eliot Ware, the deceased father and husband of Mary and Elizabeth Ware, respectively. The models \\"In memory of physician Charles Eliot Ware (18141887), a graduate of this university. These models were presented by his wife and daughter who survived him. He sincerely cherished and deeply loved native plants as friends.\\" The models are glass with wire supports (internal or external), glue, a variety of organic media, and paint or enamel coloring.NcNally, Rika Smith and Nancy Buschini (1993). Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Volume 32, Number 3, Article 2 (pp. 231 to 240) The Boston Globe has called them \\"anatomically perfect and, given all the glass-workers who've tried and failed, unreproducible.\\"Putting the Glass Flowers in new light - http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/05/putting-the-glass-flowers-in- new-light/Harvard's glass flowers return - https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2016/05/24/harvard-glass-flowers- return/SwICUX1ZgpsP3CPPeMbpuO/story.html upright=1.4 It is often said that the Blaschkas employed secret techniques now lost; in fact their techniques were common at the time, but their skill, enthusiasm, and meticulous study and observation of their subjects in life were extraordinary, which Leopold ascribed to familial tradition, in a letter to Mary Lee Ware: \\"Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms ... The only way to become a glass modeler of skill, I have often said to people, is to get a good great-grandfather who loved glass.\\" The Blaschkas' primary technique was lampworking, in which glass is melted over a flame fed by air from a foot-powered bellows, then shaped using tools to pinch, pull or cut; forms were blown as well. Their old- fashioned Bohemian lamp-working table is part of the museum exhibit. Over the years Rudolf brought more and more of the entire production process under his personal control, eventually even manufacturing his own glass and colorants. Botanist Donald Schnell has called the models \\"enchanting\\", and relates his surprise at finding that the models faithfully depict an unpublished detail of a bee's behavior while pollinating a particular planta detail which he had privately hypothesized.Schnell, Donald (2002). Carnivorous Plants of the United States and Canada. Timber Press. .

More than 210,000 visitors view the collection annually. In 1936, when Harvard invited the public to tour the campus in honor of its tercentenary, a New York Times reporter taking the tour commented \\"Tercentenary or no, the chief focus of interest remains the famous glass flowers, the first of which was put on exhibition in 1893, and which with additions at intervals since, have never failed to draw exclamations of wonder or disbelief from visitors.\\" Many visitors initially believe the Glass Flowers to be real, organic, plants and soon after entering or leaving exhibition inquire \\"Where are the glass flowers?\\"Geoffrey N.

He was educated at Appleby Grammar School and Queen's College, Oxford, where he took B.A. and M.A. degrees, and became a fellow of his college in 1572. Two years later he was back in Appleby, to become the first headmaster under the Charter of Queen Elizabeth. He converted to Catholicism in 1576.

He worked as a missionary priest in Northern England, often accompanied by John Speed. His activities were largely centered around Brancepeth Castle, owned by Lady Margaret Neville. An effective missionary, the authorities were eager to capture him. In January 1584 the Privy Council ordered Lord Scrope, Warden of the Western March, to take energetic measures for his arrest.

Following his arrest he was taken to the Tower of London for interrogation on the rack by Richard Topcliffe. Returned to Durham he was condemned by the Assizes and hanged, drawn and quartered at nearby Dryburn on 24 July 1594. This is now the site of St. Leonard's school.

Meridian telescopes rely on the rotation of the sky to bring objects into their field of view and are mounted on a fixed, horizontal, east–west axis. The similar transit instrument, transit circle, or transit telescope is likewise mounted on a horizontal axis, but the axis need not be fixed in the east–west direction. For instance, a surveyor's theodolite can function as a transit instrument if its telescope is capable of a full revolution about the horizontal axis. Meridian circles are often called by these names, although they are less specific. For many years, transit timings were the most accurate method of measuring the positions of heavenly bodies, and meridian instruments were relied upon to perform this painstaking work. Before spectroscopy, photography, and the perfection of reflecting telescopes, the measuring of positions (and the deriving of orbits and astronomical constants) was the major work of observatories. Importance Meridian circle at Saint Petersburg Kunstkamera, built by T.L. Ertel, Germany, 1828 Fixing a telescope to move only in the meridian has advantages in the high-precision work for which these instruments are employed: *The very simple mounting is easier to manufacture and maintain to a high precision. *At most locations on the Earth, the meridian is the only plane in which celestial coordinates can be indexed directly with such a simple mounting; the equatorial coordinate system aligns naturally with the meridian at all times. Revolving the telescope about its axis moves it directly in declination, and objects move through its field of view in right ascension. *All objects in the sky are subject to the distortion of atmospheric refraction, which tends to make objects appear slightly higher in the sky than they actually are. At the meridian, this distortion is in declination only, and is easily accounted for; elsewhere in the sky, refraction causes a complex distortion in coordinates which is more difficult to reduce. Such complex analysis is not conducive to high precision. Basic instrument Meridian circle at the Kuffner observatory, Vienna, Austria, built by Repsold & Sons, Hamburg, 1886. Note the counterweights, the short, green cylindrical objects at the outer top of the mechanism, and the four long, thin, microscopes for reading the circles. The state of the art of meridian instruments of the late 19th and early 20th century is described here, giving some idea of the precise methods of construction, operation and adjustment employed. Chauvenet (1868), p. 132, art. 119; p. 283, art. 195 Norton (1867), p. 39ff =Construction= The earliest transit telescope was not placed in the middle of the axis, but nearer to one end, to prevent the axis from bending under the weight of the telescope. Later, it was usually placed in the centre of the axis, which consisted of one piece of brass or gun metal with turned cylindrical steel pivots at each end. Several instruments were made entirely of steel, which was much more rigid than brass. The pivots rested on V-shaped bearings, either set into massive stone or brick piers which supported the instrument, or attached to metal frameworks on the tops of the piers. The temperature of the instrument and local atmosphere were monitored by thermometers. The piers were usually separate from the foundation of the building, to prevent transmission of vibration from the building to the telescope. To relieve the pivots from the weight of the instrument, which would have distorted their shape and caused rapid wear, each end of the axis was supported by a hook or yoke with friction rollers, suspended from a lever supported by the pier, counterbalanced so as to leave only a small fraction of the weight on the precision V-shaped bearings. In some cases, the counterweight pushed up on the roller bearings from below.Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 25 The bearings were set nearly in a true east–west line, but fine adjustment was possible by horizontal and vertical screws. A spirit level was used to monitor for any inclination of the axis to the horizon. Eccentricity (an off-center condition) or other irregularities of the pivots of the telescope's axis was accounted for, in some cases, by providing another telescope through the axis itself. By observing the motion of an artificial star, located east or west of the center of the main instrument, and seen through this axis telescope and a small collimating telescope, as the main telescope was rotated, the shape of the pivots, and any wobble of the axis, could be determined.Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 27 Top view of a circle-reading microscope; from Norton (1867). Near each end of the axis, attached to the axis and turning with it, was a circle or wheel for measuring the angle of the telescope to the zenith or horizon. Generally of 1 to 3 feet or more in diameter, it was divided to 2 or 5 arcminutes, on a slip of silver set into the face of the circle near the circumference. These graduations were read by microscopes, generally four for each circle, mounted to the piers or a framework surrounding the axis, at 90° intervals around the circles. By averaging the four readings the eccentricity (from inaccurate centering of the circles) and the errors of graduation were greatly reduced. Each microscope was furnished with a micrometer screw, which moved crosshairs, with which the distance of the circle graduations from the centre of the field of view could be measured. The drum of the screw was divided to measure single seconds of arc (0.1\\" being estimated), while the number of revolutions were counted by a comb like scale in the field of view. The microscopes were given such magnification and placed at such a distance from the circle that one revolution of the micrometer screw corresponded to 1 arcminute (1') on the circle. The error was determined occasionally by measuring standard intervals of 2' or 5' on the circle. The periodic errors of the screw were accounted for. On some instruments, one of the circles was graduated and read more coarsely than the other, and was used only in finding the target stars. The telescope consisted of two tubes screwed to the central cube of the axis. The tubes were usually conical and as stiff as possible to help prevent flexure. The connection to the axis was also as firm as possible, as flexure of the tube would affect declinations deduced from observations. The flexure in the horizontal position of the tube was determined by two collimators – telescopes placed horizontally in the meridian, north and south of the transit circle, with their objective lenses towards it. These were pointed at one another (through holes in the tube of the telescope, or by removing the telescope from its mount) so that the crosshairs in their foci coincided. The collimators were often permanently mounted in these positions, with their objectives and eyepieces fixed to separate piers.Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 25 The meridian telescope was pointed to one collimator and then the other, moving through exactly 180°, and by reading the circle the amount of flexure (the amount the readings differed from 180°) was found. Absolute flexure, that is, a fixed bend in the tube, was detected by arranging that eyepiece and objective lens could be interchanged, and the average of the two observations of the same star was free from this error. Parts of the apparatus, including the circles, pivots and bearings, were sometimes enclosed in glass cases to protect them from dust. These cases had openings for access. The reading microscopes then extended into the glass cases, while their eyepiece ends and micrometers were protected from dust by removable silk covers.Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 26 Certain instrumental errors could be averaged out by reversing the telescope on its mounting. A carriage was provided, which ran on rails between the piers, and on which the axis, circles and telescope could be raised by a screw-jack, wheeled out from between the piers, turned 180°, wheeled back, and lowered again. The observing building housing the meridian circle did not have a rotating dome, as is often seen at observatories. Since the telescope observed only in the meridian, a vertical slot in the north and south walls, and across the roof between these, was all that was necessary. The building was unheated and kept as much as possible at the temperature of the outside air, to avoid air currents which would disturb the telescopic view. The building also housed the clocks, recorders, and other equipment for making observations. =Operation= At the focal plane, the eye end of the telescope had a number of vertical and one or two horizontal wires (crosshairs). In observing stars, the telescope was first directed downward at a basin of mercury forming a perfectly horizontal mirror and reflecting an image of the crosshairs back up the telescope tube. The crosshairs were adjusted until coincident with their reflection, and the line of sight was then perfectly vertical; in this position the circles were read for the nadir point. The telescope was next brought up to the approximate declination of the target star by watching the finder circle. The instrument was provided with a clamping apparatus, by which the observer, after having set the approximate declination, could clamp the axis so the telescope could not be moved in declination, except very slowly by a fine screw. By this slow motion, the telescope was adjusted until the star moved along the horizontal wire (or if there were two, in the middle between them), from the east side of the field of view to the west. Following this, the circles were read by the microscopes for a measurement of the apparent altitude of the star. The difference between this measurement and the nadir point was the nadir distance of the star. A movable horizontal wire or declination-micrometer was also used. Another method of observing the apparent altitude of a star was to take half of the angular distance between the star observed directly and its reflection observed in a basin of mercury. The average of these two readings was the reading when the line of sight was horizontal, the horizontal point of the circle. The small difference in latitude between the telescope and the basin of mercury was accounted for. The vertical wires were used for observing transits of stars, each wire furnishing a separate result. The time of transit over the middle wire was estimated, during subsequent analysis of the data, for each wire by adding or subtracting the known interval between the middle wire and the wire in question. These known intervals were predetermined by timing a star of known declination passing from one wire to the other, the pole star being best on account of its slow motion. Timings were originally made by an \\"eye and ear\\" method, estimating the interval between two beats of a clock. Later, timings were registered by pressing a key, the electrical signal making a mark on a strip recorder. Later still, the eye end of the telescope was usually fitted with an impersonal micrometer, a device which allowed matching a vertical crosshair's motion to the star's motion. Set precisely on the moving star, the crosshair would trigger the electrical timing of the meridian crossing, removing the observer's personal equation from the measurement. Chauvenet (1868), p. 138, art. 121 The field of the wires could be illuminated; the lamps were placed at some distance from the piers in order not to heat the instrument, and the light passed through holes in the piers and through the hollow axis to the center, whence it was directed to the eye-end by a system of prisms. To determine absolute declinations or polar distances, it was necessary to determine the observatory's colatitude, or distance of the celestial pole from the zenith, by observing the upper and lower culmination of a number of circumpolar stars. The difference between the circle reading after observing a star and the reading corresponding to the zenith was the zenith distance of the star, and this plus the colatitude was the north polar distance. To determine the zenith point of the circle, the telescope was directed vertically downwards at a basin of mercury, the surface of which formed an absolutely horizontal mirror. The observer saw the horizontal wire and its reflected image, and moving the telescope to make these coincide, its optical axis was made perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, and the circle reading was 180° \\\\+ zenith point. In observations of stars refraction was taken into account as well as the errors of graduation and flexure. If the bisection of the star on the horizontal wire was not made in the centre of the field, allowance was made for curvature, or the deviation of the star's path from a great circle, and for the inclination of the horizontal wire to the horizon. The amount of this inclination was found by taking repeated observations of the zenith distance of a star during the one transit, the pole star being the most suitable because of its slow motion. Attempts were made to record the transits of a star photographically. A photographic plate was placed in the focus of a transit instrument and a number of short exposures made, their length and the time being registered automatically by a clock. The exposing shutter was a thin strip of steel, fixed to the armature of an electromagnet. The plate thus recorded a series of dots or short lines, and the vertical wires were photographed on the plate by throwing light through the objective lens for one or two seconds. =Adjustment= Chabot Space & Science Center's meridian transit telescope in Oakland, California, built by Fauth, 1885. Note the observer's chair between the piers, and the narrow opening in the wall and roof for access to the sky. Because the telescope observes only in the meridian, no rotating dome is necessary. Meridian circles required precise adjustment to do accurate work. Norton (1867), p. 33ff The rotation axis of the main telescope needed to be exactly horizontal. A sensitive spirit level, designed to rest on the pivots of the axis, performed this function. By adjusting one of the V-shaped bearings, the bubble was centered. The line of sight of the telescope needed to be exactly perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This could be done by sighting a distant, stationary object, lifting and reversing the telescope on its bearings, and again sighting the object. If the crosshairs did not intersect the object, the line of sight was halfway between the new position of the crosshairs and the distant object; the crosshairs were adjusted accordingly and the process repeated as necessary. Also, if the rotation axis was known to be perfectly horizontal, the telescope could be directed downward at a basin of mercury, and the crosshairs illuminated. The mercury acted as a perfectly horizontal mirror, reflecting an image of the crosshairs back up the telescope tube. The crosshairs could then be adjusted until coincident with their reflection, and the line of sight was then perpendicular to the axis. The line of sight of the telescope needed to be exactly within the plane of the meridian. This was done approximately by building the piers and the bearings of the axis on an east–west line. The telescope was then brought into the meridian by repeatedly timing the (apparent, incorrect) upper and lower meridian transits of a circumpolar star and adjusting one of the bearings horizontally until the interval between the transits was equal. Another method used calculated meridian crossing times for particular stars as established by other observatories. This was an important adjustment, and much effort was spent in perfecting it. In practice, none of these adjustments were perfect. The small errors introduced by the imperfections were mathematically corrected during the analysis of the data. Zenith telescopes Some telescopes designed to measure star transits are zenith telescopes designed to point straight up at or near the zenith for extreme precision measurement of star positions. They use an altazimuth mount, instead of a meridian circle, fitted with leveling screws. Extremely sensitive levels are attached to the telescope mount to make angle measurements and the telescope has an eyepiece fitted with a micrometer. History =Overview= The idea of having an instrument (quadrant) fixed in the plane of the meridian occurred even to the ancient astronomers and is mentioned by Ptolemy, but it was not carried into practice until Tycho Brahe constructed a large meridian quadrant. Meridian circles have been used since the 18th century to accurately measure positions of stars in order to catalog them. This is done by measuring the instant when the star passes through the local meridian. Its altitude above the horizon is noted as well. Knowing one's geographic latitude and longitude these measurements can be used to derive the star's right ascension and declination. Once good star catalogs were available a transit telescope could be used anywhere in the world to accurately measure local longitude and time by observing local meridian transit times of catalogue stars. Prior to the invention of the atomic clock this was the most reliable source of accurate time. =Antiquity= In the Almagest, Ptolemy describes a meridian circle which consisted of a fixed graduated outer ring and a movable inner ring with tabs that used a shadow to set the Sun's position. It was mounted vertically and aligned with the meridian. The instrument was used to measure the altitude of the Sun at noon in order to determine the path of the ecliptic. =17th century= The world's first meridian circle from Ole Rømer's Observatorium TusculanumA meridian circle enabled the observer to simultaneously determine right ascension and declination, but it does not appear to have been much used for right ascension during the 17th century, the method of equal altitudes by portable quadrants or measures of the angular distance between stars with an astronomical sextant being preferred. These methods were very inconvenient, and in 1690, Ole Rømer invented the transit instrument. =18th century= The transit instrument consists of a horizontal axis in the direction east and west resting on firmly fixed supports, and having a telescope fixed at right angles to it, revolving freely in the plane of the meridian. At the same time Rømer invented the altitude and azimuth instrument for measuring vertical and horizontal angles, and in 1704, he combined a vertical circle with his transit instrument, so as to determine both co-ordinates at the same time. This latter idea was, however, not adopted elsewhere, although the transit instrument soon came into universal use (the first one at Greenwich being mounted in 1721), and the mural quadrant continued until the end of the century to be employed for determining declinations. The advantages of using a whole circle, it being less liable to change its figure and not requiring reversal in order to observe stars north of the zenith, were then again recognized by Jesse Ramsden, who also improved the method of reading off angles by means of a micrometer microscope as described below. =19th century= The 6-inch transit circle of the U.S. Naval Observatory, built by Warner and Swasey, 1898 The making of circles was shortly afterwards taken up by Edward Troughton, who constructed the first modern transit circle in 1806 for Groombridge's observatory at Blackheath, the Groombridge Transit Circle (a meridian transit circle). Troughton afterwards abandoned the idea and designed the mural circle to take the place of the mural quadrant. In the United Kingdom, the transit instrument and mural circle continued until the middle of the 19th century to be the principal instrument in observatories, the first transit circle constructed there being that at Greenwich (mounted in 1850). However, on the continent, the transit circle superseded them from the years 1818–1819, when two circles by Johann Georg Repsold and Georg Friedrich von Reichenbach were mounted at Göttingen, and one by Reichenbach at Königsberg. The firm of Repsold and Sons was for a number of years eclipsed by that of Pistor and Martins in Berlin, who furnished various observatories with first-class instruments. Following the death of Martins, the Repsolds again took the lead and made many transit circles. The observatories of Harvard College, Cambridge University and Edinburgh University had large circles by Troughton and Simms. The Airy Transit Circles at the Royal Greenwich Observatory (1851) and that at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope (1855) were made by Ransomes and May of Ipswich. The Greenwich instrument had optical and instrumental work by Troughton and Simms to the design of George Biddell Airy. =20th century and beyond= The Ron Stone/Flagstaff Astrometric Scanning Transit Telescope of the U.S.Naval Observatory, built by Farrand Optical Company, 1981 A modern-day example of this type of telescope is the 8 inch (~0.2m) Flagstaff Astrometric Scanning Transit Telescope (FASTT) at the USNO Flagstaff Station Observatory. Modern meridian circles are usually automated. The observer is replaced with a CCD camera. As the sky drifts across the field of view, the image built up in the CCD is clocked across (and out of) the chip at the same rate. This allows some improvements: , at SAO/NASA ADS *The CCD can collect light for as long as the image is crossing it, allowing a dimmer limiting magnitude to be reached. *The data can be collected for as long as the telescope is in operation – an entire night is possible, allowing a strip of sky many degrees in length to be scanned. *Data can be compared directly to any reference object which happens to be within the scan – usually a bright extragalactic object, like a quasar, with an accurately-known position. This eliminates the need for some of the painstaking adjustment of the meridian instrument, although monitoring of declination, azimuth, and level is still performed with CCD scanners and laser interferometers. *Atmospheric refraction can be accounted for automatically, by monitoring temperature, pressure, and dew point of the air electronically. *Data can be stored and analyzed at will. The first automated instrument was the Carlsberg Automatic Meridian Circle, which came online in 1984.

He was the seventeenth governor of Colorado. Life and career Buchtel was the son of Jonathan B. Buchtel, a physician, and Eliza Newcomer Buchtel. Within a couple of years of his birth, his parents relocated their family to Elkhart, Indiana. Henry was a younger cousin of John Richards Buchtel, the founder in 1870 of Buchtel College (later the University of Akron). In 1871, Henry's older brother, William, married Helen Barnum, a daughter of P. T. Barnum.Garth, Henry Augustus Buchtel, pp. 13, 15, 16-17, 34. He graduated from Indiana Asbury (now DePauw) University in 1872 and was ordained to the Methodist Episcopal ministry. He married Mary Stevenson on February 4, 1873. The couple moved to Bulgaria where they served as missionaries from April until August 1873 when his wife's deteriorating health forced their return to the United States. Over the next twenty-six years, he served as pastor of congregations in Indiana, Colorado, New York, and New Jersey. During his years as a minister, Henry and Mary had four children: Frost Craft (1875), Emma (1882), Henry Jr. (1896), and Mary (1898). Henry Jr. died in Denver from scarlet fever in 1901. In 1899, Buchtel was chosen as chancellor of the University of Denver, officially assuming his duties in January 1900. At that time, the university had debts of around $175,000 and faced the possibility of foreclosure on its mortgages. The new chancellor began fundraising immediately, and managed to retire the debts by August 1903 although the university's finances remained precarious for many years afterward. Buchtel worked with William G. Evans, both a son of its founder, John Evans, and a trustee of the university, to place the institution's funding on a firmer foundation by organizing a series of fundraising campaigns and establishing an endowment for the school.Garth, Henry Augustus Buchtel, pp. 143, 172, 179, 252-59. Reviewing these efforts on behalf of the university, the Denver Post noted in 1924 that: > In twenty years under Dr. Buchtel's guidance, $1,750,000 was raised on his > personal appeal for its development and it stands today backed by 20,000 > subscribers . . .Denver Post, 23 October 1924, p. 6. In September 1906, after the Republican Party's nominee for governor, Phillip B. Stewart, withdrew from the race, a group of party officials, Franklin Brooks, George Stidger, and John F. Vivian, decided to offer the nomination to Chancellor Buchtel. Before accepting the trio's proposal to fill the vacancy on the ballot, Buchtel requested their promises that he would have absolute independence if elected. With their assurances, Buchtel became the Republican nominee. He was elected governor of Colorado in November and served one term from 1907 until 1909, while continuing to handle his duties as chancellor.Garth, Henry Augustus Buchtel, pp. 185-196. A stroke in September 1920 forced Dr. Buchtel to resign his position as chancellor the following December.Garth, Henry Augustus Buchtel, pp. 265-267. Four years later, he suffered another stroke and, within a few days, died at his home in Denver on Wednesday, October 22, 1924. He was buried at Fairmount Cemetery in Denver.Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News, October 23, 1924. The Buchtel Bungalow. In 1988, the Buchtel Bungalow, located at 2100 S. Columbine St. just two blocks east of the University of Denver campus, was listed with the National Register of Historic Places. Finished in the first half of 1906, the house served as Governor Buchtel's residence from 1907 until 1909 and for the remaining years of his life. Today, Buchtel Bungalow is owned by the University of Denver and serves as the home of current Chancellor Rebecca Chopp. In addition, Buchtel Boulevard in Denver was built and named to honor Dr. Buchtel.Goodstein, Denver Streets, pp. 29-30.

He was an early figure in the first punk rock music scene in Chicago. He briefly attended Roycemore School in Evanston, Illinois. His first known recorded appearance was in July 1978, as a guitarist-singer with the protopunk-garage-New Wavish band The Rabbits, who opened a show in Schaumburg, Illinois by power-pop up-and-comers Pezband. After the breakup of The Rabbits in the fall of 1978, Bjorklund formed the project band Strike Under with his brother, Chris.

Following the breakup of Strike Under, Bjorklund briefly formed another Chicago punk band, Terminal Beach. In 1987, Bjorklund's brother Chris, joined The Effigies, a more successful Chicago punk band fronted by Kezdy's brother John. Steve Bjorklund formed Breaking Circus in Chicago; their initial EP release included the memorable song (Knife in the) Marathon. He relocated to Minneapolis, where Breaking Circus continued. Breaking Circus was active through approximately 1988 and is considered an important example of early post-punk/industrial music in Minneapolis. Later, Bjorklund was a member of Minneapolis band Balloon Guy. Bjorklund continued to work in the recording industry, with a number of punk bands in Chicago and Minneapolis, through the early 1990s, credited primarily as producer or as mastering re-mixer.

Exactly how a running record is constructed varies according to the specific purpose for which it will be used and the program for which it is used. However, there are some similarities across methods. First, a child reads a selected book or passage aloud. The teacher or tutor has a copy of the words from the text, typed out on a different piece of paper, or uses a blank sheet of paper and consults the text later. As the child reads, the adult makes a mark for each correctly-read word. However, if the child makes a mistake, the adult might circle the word, write down the type of error, or even write down what incorrect word was said. After the child is finished reading, the adult calculates the percentage of words read correctly and how often the child self-corrected an error. The adult will also conduct a miscue analysis either during the reading session, or after it is completed. The purpose of a running record is to give the teacher an indication of whether material currently being read is too easy or too difficult for the child, and it serves as an indicator of the areas where a child's reading can improve— for example, if a child frequently makes word substitutions that begin with the same letter as the printed word, the teacher will know to focus on getting the child to look beyond the first letter of a word.

Domhnall's reign is noted for its tension with the monarchy. King David II irritated Domhnall by residing at Dumbarton on at least twelve occasions between 1341 and 1346. Domhnall was probably one of the happier Scottish magnates when King David and his agent, Malcolm Fleming, Sheriff of Dumbarton, were captured by the English at the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346. Domhnall was also faced with the challenge of fending off the aggressive Stewart clan. Having no male heirs, Domhnall is credited with saving the Mormaerdom by marrying off his daughter Margaret to his kinsman Baltar mac Amlaimh, the man usually known today as Walter of Faslane. This act kept the Mormaerdom within the Lennox line, and preserved it in the medium term from Stewart takeover. Domhnall died in 1365.

Initially built for the Royal Navy, it bore the name of HMS Silverton during British use. History The ship was laid down on 5 December 1939 in the J. Samuel White Shipyard in Cowes. On 4 December 1940 she was launched as HMS Silverton for the Royal Navy. However on 3 April 1941 it was agreed that she would be allocated (along with ) to the Polish Navy to replace the ex-French destroyer which was being manned by the Poles. Commissioned on 28 May of that year, she was renamed ORP Krakowiak, after either a folk dance from Kraków or an inhabitant of that city. As she was the first ship of her class to be handed to the Poles, until 10 July 1941, her crew spent most of their time training and getting to know the ship. After that date she entered line service in the convoy escort role in the North Atlantic. In December of that year she was among the ships to take part in the successful raid against a German naval outpost on the Lofoten islands. Throughout the war she also patrolled the North Sea, often engaging in skirmishes with German torpedo boats. In 1943 she moved to the Mediterranean, where she took part in, among others, Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, and later in the Dodecanese Campaign. Altogether, during the Second World War she covered over escorting 206 different convoys, including nine in the North Atlantic. She shot down three enemy planes, but the number of enemy vessels sunk is unclear. Postwar After the Allied powers withdrew their support for the Polish government, on 28 September 1946 the ship was decommissioned by the Polish Navy and returned to the British, who commissioned it under its original name and placed her in reserve at Devonport.Critchley, Mike, \\"British Warships Since 1945: Part 3: Destroyers\\", Maritime Books: Liskeard, UK, 1982. , page 32 She was reclassified as a frigate and given a new number - F 55.

He grew up with the Ojibwe nation, becoming fully acculturated and learning the Saulteaux language. He married an Indian woman, served as a guide for European fur traders, and worked as an interpreter. His story of life with the American Indians was published in 1830. Titled A Narrative of the Captivity and Adventures of John Tanner..., it was a popular success and remains an important historical record. Early life John Tanner was born about 1780. His father, also named John Tanner, was a former preacher from Virginia. The boy’s mother died when he was two and in 1789 the family settled on the Ohio River in Kentucky near the confluence with the Great Miami River.Woodcock (1988) It was considered dangerous country as settlers competed for territory with the local Shawnee Indians who fought to defend their lands. In 1789 at the age of nine, Tanner was kidnapped by two Ojibwe men and carried north into the Michigan Territory. He was badly mistreated during the first two years of captivity but then was sold to Netnokwa, an Ottawa woman who adopted Tanner and treated him more kindly. She helped him gain the skills he needed to survive and encouraged him in rites of passage such as killing a bear and participating in his first war party. From 1790 to about 1820 Tanner lived with the Ojibwe and Saulteaux in the Great Lakes and Red River regions.Sayre (2007) When Tanner lived among these Indians, their traditional life-style as hunters and trappers in the northern forests was beginning to change. The fur trade was drawing the tribes away from subsistence hunting and encouraging fur trapping for profit. Deceitful traders, a shortage of game, and the introduction of firearms and alcohol all had a negative impact on tribes in the region. In 1800, when he was 20, Tanner married an Ojibwe woman, Mis-kwa- bun-o-kwa, the niece of Michigan fur trader, Madeleine LaFramboise.LaFramboise' Journals In 1801 he met a fur trader, Daniel Harmon, who noted in his diary that Tanner spoke only Saulteaux, was regarded as a chief by his people, and was like an Indian in every way except color.Bowsfield (1957) Around 1807 his first wife left him and he remarried in 1810 to an Indian woman known as Therezia. During both marriages he quarreled with his in-laws and was threatened with violence. By 1812 he was considering a return to his family in Kentucky but the War of 1812 made travel impossible.Woodcock (1988) Fur trade and family reunion In 1812 Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk established a colony in the region on land purchased from the Hudson's Bay Company. Tanner assisted the colonists by hunting bison during their first winter when food was scarce. In 1817, Selkirk employed Tanner as a guide and they set out to recapture Fort Douglas from the English fur trading North West Company. After their success, Lord Selkirk took an interest in Tanner. Using Tanner's vague memories of his childhood, Selkirk located his family in the United States and helped to reunite them. Traveling with his second wife and children, Tanner spent the years 1818-1822 in pursuit of his family. His wife settled on Mackinac Island and their children attended missionary school. Ultimately, the cultural gap proved too big and Tanner gave up hopes of returning to his previous life.Bowsfield (1957) Tanner returned to the Canadian territories, where he worked for a time as a trader with the American Fur Company on Rainy Lake. In 1823 he tried to reclaim his children from his first marriage. His former wife refused to surrender them and persuaded an Indian to try to kill him. Although badly wounded he survived the attack but his children and their mother vanished while he was convalescing. Life as an interpreter Mnemonic figures for an Indian song, in Narrative In 1827, after a lengthy recovery, he settled with his second wife back on Mackinac Island. He worked as an interpreter at a U.S. army outpost. It was here that he met Edwin James, an explorer, botanist, and physician who transcribed Tanner's dramatic story of life among the Ojibwe. Published in 1830, A Narrative of the Captivity and Adventures of John Tanner... was a popular success as well as an important and detailed historical record of the Ojibwe people during a critical period of change. It was later translated into German and French. Tanner also collaborated with Edwin James to create an Ojibwe translation of the New Testament.Sayre (2007)Woodcock (1988) Tanner moved to Sault Ste. Marie in 1828 and began working as an interpreter for the Indian agent, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. Tanner became involved in a feud between Schoolcraft and Abel Bingham, a Baptist missionary, over control of the local mission school. Eventually, both Schoolcraft and Bingham accused Tanner of siding with the other and betraying their trust.Fierst (1986) By 1833 Tanner was unemployed and essentially lived as an outcast on the edge of town for the rest of his life. In 1846 his cabin was burned to the ground and days later he disappeared at the same time Schoolcraft's younger brother, James Schoolcraft, was found murdered. Townspeople quickly suspected that Tanner had killed Schoolcraft but Tanner was never apprehended and his guilt was never proven conclusively. Years later, Tanner's body was uncovered in a bog not far from town.Fierst (1986) A grandson of his, also named John Tanner, homesteaded on the Little Saskatchewan River where he ran a ferry. The settlement became known as \\"Tanner's Crossing\\". It is the present-day site of Minnedosa, Manitoba.

Samson is a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) – usually referred to as \\"the Department\\" in the novels. He is a central character in three trilogies written by Deighton, set in the years 1983–1988, with a large gap between 1984 and 1987. The first trilogy comprises the books Berlin Game, Mexico Set and London Match, the second comprises Spy Hook, Spy Line and Spy Sinker, and the third and final trilogy comprises Faith, Hope and Charity. The plot of the entire trilogy of trilogies revolves around Samson's wife Fiona, also an intelligence officer, and which side she is really working for, after she has defected to the East Germans in the first trilogy, leaving a distraught Bernard with their two children. Her defection also causes some of his superiors to question his loyalty. Samson undergoes sacrifice in his duties and is often ignored by his superiors, being passed over for promotion or sent to Berlin during Christmas. This is especially true in the first trilogy. Like Deighton's earlier unnamed spy character (\\"Harry Palmer\\" in the film adaptations), Samson is cynical and has a disrespect for his superiors and any ambitious colleagues. Bernard's description appears in Berlin Game: Bernard Samson is also the name of a Swiss Franciscan seller of indulgences, who was denounced by Zwingli in 1516. Early life Bernard Samson is the son of Brian Samson, a British SIS operative who worked undercover in Germany during World War II and who became head of the Berlin Field Unit after the war. Brian Samson plays a small role in Deighton's 1987 prequel novel Winter. Bernard grew up in post-war Berlin before the wall was built and received a typical German education rather than a privileged English one and never went to university. Despite his ability to speak German fluently, he is seen as an Englishmen by Germans, and as a German by the British, leaving him unsure about which country he really belongs to. Bernard worked for his father from a young age with his best friend Werner Volkmann. They served as couriers making payments to agents and performing espionage related 'odd-jobs'. This enabled Bernard to make friendships and connections that would serve him well in his future work. Career in London Bernard quit being a Berlin field agent after a mission in which a friend was killed and he was lucky to escape to the West alive. Bernard is troubled by all the violence he has both suffered and inflicted, has recurring nightmares and drinks too much. Bernard hoped to get the German Desk but was passed over for Dicky Cruyer, an Oxford man with no field experience. Bernard now runs errands for Dicky, whom he considers incompetent and dangerous. Bernard is continually being tipped to take over the Berlin Field Unit if Frank Harrington ever retires. Bernard's old friend Werner was sacked by the dept. after a cable he was delivering turned up in the hands of the KGB. At the start of the novels, Bernard's wife Fiona, who went to Oxford with Dicky and got her job through Bernard, is working on the top floor and is a rising star in the department. Much of what happened to Bernard was done in order to keep him in the dark about his wife's real mission and he is led to believe that she is a KGB agent who used him, betrayed all his missions in exchange for keeping him safe and then defected to the East. This has left him embittered towards the department and very cynical. Bernard is very stubborn and believes he knows better than his superiors who are all just desk men. He trusts no one except for his old friend Werner. His secretive and suspicious ways often keep Bernard alive but they just as often get him into trouble and cause harm to many of those around him. Analysis Len Deighton has stated that Bernard's testimony in the books is not reliable. Samson is biased, especially towards his superiors, and is prone to regarding himself too highly. The true nature of his character can be gleaned from reading between the lines, or alternatively from the sixth novel, Spy Sinker, which recounts the events of the previous books from a third-person perspective, and casts doubt upon Bernard's reliability as a narrator, especially in his assessment of his colleagues' capabilities and motives. Critic Wesley Britton has seen the Bernard Samson books as an echo of the Biblical story of Samson: like Samson, Bernard has his own Delilah, when his wife turns out to be an apparent traitor. In other media Bernard Samson was played by Ian Holm and Fiona Samson by Mel Martin in a 1988 Granada Television adaptation of the first trilogy, entitled Game, Set and Match, transmitted as twelve 60 minute episodes. Filmed on location in Berlin and Mexico, the project included a large international cast with 3,000 extras and a budget of $8 million. It is considered the most ambitious espionage miniseries ever filmed. While critically acclaimed, the ratings for the series were poor. In February 2008, director Quentin Tarantino expressed interest in developing the Game, Set and Match trilogy as a three-hour film. He is quoted as saying, \\"I would see if I could boil it down to the fate of the characters, and ignore all this Maquis double agent stuff.

The Parish of Cam(bus)nethan, as it was known was established in the 11th century, with the parish church standing on the banks of the River Clyde, in the countryside near the modern neighbourhoods of Netherton and Gowkthrapple. The parish would have remained a rural, lowly populated area until the 1600s at least. The modern settlement began some time after the Middle Ages (exact time period unknown), but remained a small hamlet. It grew massively alongside its neighbour, Wishaw, during the Industrial Revolution, with industries such as railways, textiles, quarrying and in particular, coal mining. This established Cambusnethan's importance to the Scottish economy. Eventually, both Wishaw and Cambusnethan grew so large that the boundaries between the towns faded and both settlements became one large urban area. Throughout the 20th century, many housing estates were built in Cambusnethan, further expanding it. Today, Cambusnethan is much integrated with Wishaw to the point where it is mostly considered to be an area of the town rather than a town in its own right. Transport  Cambusnethan is served by First service 267 every 10 minutes from Glasgow's Buchanan bus station. It also has a separate hourly express bus services to Glasgow in the form of the First service X11. An infrequent local bus service to Livingston, West Lothian also serves the area. There are the remnants of a railway line running through the area. This has been disconnected for almost 80 years with most of the track and bridges now gone, though some elements of the line still exist behind the telephone exchange and the social club. The section between the Miner's Club and the Hot Water pond (Perchy Pond) was used as a dump in the 70s/80s, and is thus mostly filled in now. People to this day still fly tip there despite the excellent new council refuse facility in Netherton. Local facilities Cambusnethan has two Church of Scotland Presbyterian churches: Cambusnethan North Parish Church, at the top of Kirk Road, and Cambusnethan Old and Morningside Parish Church, further down the hill. Cambusnethan Primary School is non-denominational and previously sat between the two churches on the other side of the road. Plans for a new, updated primary school have been confirmed, and in Summer 2006 construction work began at the top of Branchal Road, with the clearing of the local park and some of the woods surrounding the area. The new school was completed in Summer 2007, and the original building has been demolished. The local sub-post office, which sits at the entrance to the Memorial Park (East Gate) but now is shut down for good. The nearest post offices is located in Newmains or Wishaw which both are beside Cambusnethan. Following the demise of the New Day there are currently two pubs: The Horse and Anchor and The Auld Hoose. There are two convenience stores in the area, Bobbys and Northmuir licensed grocer's shop. An Indian takeaway, the Tandoori Mahal, has traded in the last few years in the shop adjacent to Bobbys. Cambusnethan also provides the area code (01698 38xxxx) for most of eastern Wishaw via the large BT telephone exchange. Another very popular meeting place is the Cambusnethan Miners' Club at the foot of Woodhall Road, also known as the red road. The site of the old Cambusnethan Primary School has become housing. The new Primary School is situated on Branchal Road Boys' Brigade Cambusnethan has two active BB companies: 1st Cambusnethan, which is affiliated to the Old Parish Church, and 2nd Cambusnethan, affiliated to the North Parish Church. 1st and 2nd Cambusnethan has 3 sections Anchors for 5-7yr olds (Primary School Years 1-3), Juniors for 7-11yr olds (Primary School Years 4-6) and Company/Seniors for 12 to 18 (Primary School Year 7 to Secondary Year 3 for Company Section and Secondary School year 4 to 6 for Seniors). Boys at the BB's are trying their best to achieve the Queen's Badge. Local landmarks The Belhaven and Stenton Mausoleum stands in the old cemetery which was associated with the ancient parish church of Cambusnethan, founded in the eighth century. A well-known local landmark is '\\"The Bing\\", well known for children to slide down it in a wheely bin or a bread crade, a large loose stone hill formed by extensive mining operations, which were active in the area until the 1960s. Cambusnethan was a major coal mining centre at the start of the 20th century and, when it was all finished, the shafts were closed and the spoil heaps landscaped to create The Bing. Cambusnethan House or Priory is a few miles west of the area and is a stunning Gothic house by Scottish architect James Gillespie Graham. It was so named because, before Wishaw existed, Cambusnethan was the name of the whole burgh stretching from Newmains to the River Clyde. Today the main town sits between Cambusnethan and the River Clyde.

The movement's primary theoreticians were Pyotr Struve, Nikolai Berdyaev, Sergei Bulgakov, Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky and Semyon Frank. The name was derived from the fact that its supporters promoted their ideas in legal publications. Unlike the earlier generation of Russian socialists known as narodniks (populists), who emphasized the role of the peasantry in transitioning to socialism, Legal Marxists used the economic theory of Karl Marx to argue that the development of capitalism in the Russian Empire was both inevitable and beneficial. As Struve put it, they provided a \\"justification for capitalism\\" in Russia. Legal Marxists held numerous open debates from the mid-1890s through the early 1900s, notably at the Free Economic Society in Saint Petersburg, and published three magazines between 1897 and 1901, all of them eventually suppressed by the imperial government: *Novoye Slovo (1897) *Nachalo (1899) *Zhizn (1899–1901, resumed abroad in 1902) Legal Marxists became particularly influential after the arrest and imprisonment of the leaders of the revolutionary wing of Russian Marxism (including Julius Martov and Vladimir Lenin) in 1895-1896. Legal Marxists and revolutionary Marxists were allied in the late 1890s within the newly formed Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, whose Manifesto Struve wrote in 1898 and Legal Marxists magazines were extensively used by revolutionary Marxists living in exile or abroad to publish their writings. However, Legal Marxists became increasingly supportive of Eduard Bernstein's revision of Marxism from 1897 on, which drew criticism from Georgy Plekhanov, Lenin and other revolutionary Marxists. Struve and other Legal Marxist leaders soon abandoned philosophical materialism for neo-Kantianism while Berdyaev, Bulgakov and Frank eventually became philosophers of religion. Tugan-Baranovsky developed a theory of cyclical economic crises under capitalism, which was also criticised by revolutionary Marxists . Starting in 1901, Legal Marxists' abandonment of Marxism led to a break with Russian social democrats and they drifted toward liberalism with Struve editing Osvobozhdenie (Liberation), a liberal magazine, from 1902 on. Eventually the leaders of the movement became allied with the radical part of the Zemstvo within Soyuz Osvobozhdeniya (Liberation Union) in 1903-1905. Most of them were prominent supporters of the Constitutional Democratic party after the Russian Revolution of 1905. Notes * See, e.g., Lenin's letter to his relatives dated June 20, 1899 in A.

During World War II her family fled to Kreinitz near Riesa, where her parents ran a farm.Westfalenpost, , January 03, 2014 After the war, when collectivisation was imposed in the GDR she had fled East Germany with her parents in 1955.Westfalenpost, , January 03, 2014 They moved to Schwelm where her parents leased the farm Gut Oberberge.Westfalenpost, , January 03, 2014 She married German air force sergeant Rolf Rometsch, who was stationed at the West German embassy. Rometsch is widely thought in some Washington journalism circles to have been one of President John F. Kennedy's girlfriends during the height of the Cold War. However, the FBI never turned up \\"any solid evidence\\" that Rometsch was a spy or that she had relations with President Kennedy. Rometsch was expelled from the U.S. on August 21, 1963 \\"because of her behavior in Washington\\", behavior which threatened to have scandalous overtones reminiscent of the Profumo affair in the United Kingdom.Reuters, U.S. 'Profumo' Scandal About to Break\\", Toledo Blade, October 27, 1963 Rometsch had been known to visit the Quorum Club located in the Carroll Arms Hotel adjacent a Senate office building. It was a private club requiring annual membership dues and was used by lawmakers and other influential men to meet for food, drink, and ladies away from the press that were constantly downstairs at the bar in the hotel lobby. Rometsch had apparently disclosed details of her illicit relations with highly placed government officials that she had met at the club, to a former FBI informant of questionable reliability. Because she had been born in East Germany and was rumored to have once worked for Walter Ulbricht the FBI decided to investigate her. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy was informed of the planned investigation on July 3, 1963. On July 12, 1963 Rometsch was interviewed by the FBI and it was concluded that the security allegations against her were not warranted and the high-level sex contacts were unsubstantiated. However, due to the sensation that the Profumo affair had created in the press and because the US State Department could not remove Rometsch without disclosing a specific reason to the West German authorities, it was decided that the information developed by the FBI would be transmitted via liaison to the State Department and then be made available discreetly to West German authorities. On August 14, 1963 Sgt. Rometsch was informed by his superiors of the allegations being made against his wife and that he was therefore being recalled back to West Germany in one week. The couple divorced on Sept. 27, 1963. She returned to Schwelm and her parents at Gut Oberberge and worked with them during beet harvest and as milkmaid.welt.de, , December 29, 2013 The allegations involving Rometsch and her subsequent removal from the U.S., were brought to the public's attention through a front page article written by Clark R. Mollenhoff in the October 26, 1963 issue of the Des Moines Register. Mollenhoff said her circle included \\"several congressional figures\\" and \\"several high executive branch officials\\" and \\"moved in a crowd that included some well-known New Frontier figures.\\" And that she led a life that \\"could not be financed on the pay of a non commissioned West German soldier.\\"Clark R. Mollenhoff, quoted in United Press, \\"Paper Says Senate Inquiry to be in Secret\\", Toledo Blade, October 27, 1963 A few days later Clark Mollenhoff asked President Kennedy at a live televised press conference if he is fulfilling the requirements of his Code of Ethics. In his response Kennedy seemed to make a veiled reference to the Rometsch story Mollenhoff had just written by saying, \\"I have always believed that innuendoes should be justified before they are made, either by me and the Congress, or even in the press.\\" Years later however, Bobby Baker seemed to have corroborated some of the claims made by Mollenoff by confirming that he was the one who introduced Ellen Rometsch to one of President Kennedy's closest friends, Bill Thompson while they were at the Quorum Club. Thompson allegedly asked if Rometsch could accompany him for dinner at the White House and Baker arranged for Rometsch to be taken to Bill Thompson's apartment where they drove to the White House together to have dinner with the President \\"on many occasions\\". Rometsch was an alleged call girl, which she denied, and was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine if she had been working as an East German spy. Although FBI director J. Edgar Hoover met privately with Senators Mike Mansfield and Everett Dirksen telling them there was \\"no evidence\\" that Rometsch was a spy, he then proceeded to tell them details about the senators who had been \\"entertained\\" by Quorum Club girls. Robert F. Kennedy desired to squelch any press reports of his brother's alleged involvement with Rometsch, which led him to seek Hoover's help in discouraging any mention of the Rometsch \\"allegations\\" in the Senate investigation of Bobby Baker, who held the post of Senate Secretary for the Majority until he resigned on October 7, 1963. According to biographer Evan Thomas, Robert Kennedy had Rometsch deported to cover-up an alleged extramarital affair John Kennedy had with her. Rometsch denied the sexual and spying allegations.

Participants come from organizations such as the Air Training Corps, Girls Venture Corps Air Cadets, Australian Air Force Cadets, United States Civil Air Patrol, German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics, Royal Canadian Air Cadets, Turkish Aeronautical Association, Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps, Singapore National Cadet Corps, along with fifteen other equivalent groups in other nations. Cadets spend approximately two weeks every July/August with their foreign counterparts. The first exchange occurred in 1947, between the United Kingdom and Canada. During the exchange, cadets are provided housing by volunteer families and on military installations in their host nation. Scheduled activities vary depending on the host nation, but often include tours of famous landmarks and cultural institutions, tours of local aviation facilities or factories, lectures with local aviation figures and visits to military units. Financially, each nation is responsible for its own cadets, and often comes from governments, civilian aviation enthusiasts, or aerospace industry. According to its mission statement, the Exchange exists to promote more than a love of aviation. Character development is equally important. Cadets develop a better perspective on the challenges other countries face. The friendships they make through the Exchange help the world combat hatred and intolerance. Through the Exchange, cadets grow to understand and appreciate the roles different nations play in aerospace, as well as build international understanding, goodwill, and friendship among young people who have a common interest in aviation. Official Members List As it is generally agreed that expansion of the Air Cadet Exchange Programme is desirable, invitations are regularly extended to additional countries. As a result, there has been a gradual expansion in the number of participating countries. Currently, membership fluctuates annually based on each country’s ability to participate. Each member organisation is responsible for the exchange costs in its own country and for transporting their cadets and escorts to and from the host country or assembly point. Based on the value and importance governments attach to the IACE programme, military air transportation is frequently provided although some countries transport their cadets and escorts by civil aircraft, and others by ground transportation.        * * Past exchange locations           Australian Participants  The AAFC exchanges with the following countries – United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, France, South Korea, Turkey and the Netherlands. Each year up to 35 cadets and instructors (escorts) are selected to represent the AAFC on various overseas visits. The people chosen act as ambassadors for Australia and the AAFC. Once exchange members are met at the designated entry city, they are the guests of the host organisation which will provide all accommodation, food and travel during the course of the program. The itinerary will give visitors the experience of places and cultural events not usually available to ordinary tourists. Australia also hosts a reciprocal visit each year from the air cadet organisations AAFC visited. HQAAFC organises the event and, in addition to the visitors, a cadet from each of the other Wings is selected to attend. These tours are great fun with visits to such places as the city of Canberra, ADFA, Australian War Memorial, Australia Zoo, Gold Coast, Brisbane, Blue Mountains, Sydney Harbour, and local defence bases (which often include the opportunity to fly in Service Aircraft).  US Participants  CAP Cadets who attend IACE are awarded this ribbon Perhaps the premier National Cadet Special Activity of the Civil Air Patrol, IACE is an opportunity for two weeks of international travel to countries around the world and meet cadets of other cadet aerospace organizations. A CAP Cadet must have a minimum grade of Cadet Captain (Amelia Earhart award) to apply for IACE. CAP, the U.S. Air Force, and the host country cover the cost of meals, lodging, and airfare. Each participant is responsible for the cost of parts of his/her IACE uniform, an activity fee, and other incidentals.

The Cumulus Media, Inc. outlet operates at 95.7 MHz with an ERP of 96 kW. Its transmitter is located near Linwood, Kansas, and studios are in Overland Park, Kansas. History KCHZ first began broadcasting as KOFO-FM, an FM simulcast for sister station KOFO, in 1962. In 1978, the station flipped to a mix of Top 40 and AOR as \\"96X\\", with the call letters KKKX. In 1986, the station flipped to easy listening/adult contemporary, branded as \\"96 HUM\\" with the KHUM call letters. The station relocated its transmitter from its original home near Ottawa to its current site near Linwood, upgraded its power to 100,000 watts, and relocated its studios, first to Lawrence, then to Topeka. In 1991, the station went silent. In 1993, the station signed back on as adult contemporary KZTO, branded as \\"Z96.\\" In January 1994, the station went silent again. 95.7 signed back on under the control of Radio 2000, Inc. on January 21, 1997, as KCHZ, \\"Channel Z95.7\\", a Modern AC outlet, after stunting with all-80's music and a heartbeat sound effect for about a week. By January 1998, it shifted to Top 40/CHR, then to Rhythmic CHR by 1999. The station was sold to Syncom Radio in 1999, and Syncom continued to adjust the station's image. KCHZ shifted back to Mainstream Top 40/CHR in 2000, then back to Rhythmic CHR by 2002, then back to a Mainstream CHR by late 2003, when Cumulus Broadcasting bought the station. By November 2005, after years of confusing listeners over what direction the station was taking, Cumulus decided that 95.7 needed a complete overhaul. To bring attention to the changeover, KCHZ began stunting with all- Christmas music at Noon on November 1, 2005, as \\"Jingle 95.7\\". The station jumped the gun a week before KUDL or KCKC would even start broadcasting Christmas music.Tim Engle, \\"Listen, it's Christmas in the air(waves)\\", The Kansas City Star, November 2, 2005. However, by the next day, the station shifted its stunting to a loop of \\"Swans Splashdown\\" by Jean-Jacques Perrey. At 5 p.m. on November 3, KCHZ shifted to Rhythmic CHR for a third time as \\"95.7 The Vibe, The Beat of Kansas City\\", with The Black Eyed Peas' \\"My Humps\\" being the first song played.Tim Engle, \\"Local radio gets a new Vibe\\", The Kansas City Star, November 5, 2005.Aircheck of \\"95.7 The Vibe\\" launch - November 3, 2005 During its tenure as a Rhythmic station, KCHZ aired a few specialty shows, including \\"The Weekend Top 30 Countdown\\" with Hollywood Hamilton, as well as \\"Sunday Night Slow Jams\\" with R.Dub. On January 27, 2009, KCHZ shifted the format to feature more mainstream top 40 hits and dropped the majority of its old school and hip hop hits, but still maintained its Rhythmic format somewhat. KCHZ continued to report to R&R;/Nielsen BDS Rhythmic Airplay panel. This kind of direction has also sparked debate from radio message boards about stations that decided to add certain Pop and Dance tracks but stay within the Rhythmic realm. By that October, KCHZ fully shifted back to Mainstream Top 40. This was part of Cumulus' plan to launch Mainstream Top 40 stations in major markets across the country.

Other features of the home include tiled and marbled fireplaces, stained glass windows, and French gilt chandeliers. Much of the home is decorated with original period furniture. Considered by many to be one of the finest examples of the French Second Empire style architecture, the home has been featured in several issues of Victorian Homes magazine as well as Victorian Decorating and Lifestyle magazine. In 2003 the home received a commendation from the Victorian Society in America for the preservation and restoration of the Victorian mansion. History John Augustus Reitz, who amassed a fortune in the lumber business, built the house in 1871 in the French Second Empire style. Built to express his success, the mansion was decorated with elegant furnishings and detailed architectural features. Upon Reitz's death in the 1890s, his eldest son Francis Joseph Reitz took over the house and completely redecorated the interior in a variety of Victorian styles. Note: This includes and Accompanying photograph The last of Reitz' children died in 1931, and the home was left to the Daughters of Isabella, a non-profit Roman Catholic women's organization. In 1944 the home was purchased by the Diocese of Evansville to become the home of its bishop. It was occupied by the first incumbent, Henry J. Grimmelsman. In 1974 the Diocese of Evansville donated the mansion to the Reitz Home Preservation Society, a non-profit organization formed to restore and preserve the home. It was officially placed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1973 and was opened for public tours a year later. Matt Rowe is currently the museum director.

They are found in forests, thick brush, savannas and cultivated areas. In Peru, they are confined to the Amazonian region where they are found in all parts of the low selva zone and many parts of the high selva zone. It is found at altitudes of and above. Agoutis live in close proximity to water, being found on the banks of all types of streams. In some areas, they construct burrows among limestone boulders, along river banks or under the roots of trees.  Reproductive Characteristics  The female black agouti is capable of breeding year-round. Also, they are considered to be aseasonally polyestrous, meaning the females can go through more than one period of estrus in a single year.Mayor, P., et al. (2011). Functional anatomy of the female genital organs of the wild black agouti (Dasyprocta fuliginosa) female in the Peruvian Amazon. Animal Reproduction Science. 123 (3-4), 249-257. One estrus period can last for 24 hours while the estrous cycle can last between 30–34 days. Furthermore, the gestation period averages 104 days and females are able to produce two newborns per litter.  References  :* John F. Eisenberg and Kent H. Redford, 2000.

The IAAA was founded in 1982 and was formally registered as an association of astronomical artists in 1986. Since its founding, the IAAA has grown to number over 120 members, representing twenty countries. The organization serves the community of artists creating works inspired by astronomy and outer space, serving as a networking resource on topics specific to the trade as well as issues common to professional artists. Although the early practitioners in the 1930s and 40s, such as Lucian Rudaux and Chesley Bonestell, (see Space Art) were realists, many IAAA artists produce work which is impressionistic, expressionistic, abstract or surreal; however, the majority (unlike science fiction and fantasy artists, who work almost purely from imagination) do have a background in astronomy, physics and mathematics which enables them to interpret accurately the data from observatories and space probes, and convert them into believable images. They may also be called upon to depict those very probes and satellites (often working with NASA or JPL scientists) – for who is out there to photograph them? They paint in oils, acrylics, gouache and markers, use pens, pastels or coloured pencils, or the latest digital technology. But these artists have an advantage over mere technology, for they can travel where machines cannot; and this includes into the past, the future and faster than light. A major activity of the IAAA is space art workshops, in most cases at remote locations with geology common to what has been discovered on other worlds. Iceland, Death Valley, Hawaii, The Colorado Plateau including Meteor Crater, and other locations with a sense of the unworldly about them have been visited in workshops. Painting and sketching such scenery outdoors helps in training the artist to know the landscape and the forces shaping it, as well as to reinforce the sensory impressions one is putting into their work of the effects of light and shade in the atmosphere.

The building itself, an unusually serene and Italianate example of Spanish Renaissance architecture, was designed by Juan de Herrera. This structure and its contents were registered in 1987 by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site together with the adjoining Seville Cathedral and the Alcázar of Seville. Structure The origin of the structure dates to 1572 when Philip II commissioned the building from Juan de Herrera, the architect of the Escorial to house the Consulado de mercaderes of Seville. Until then, the merchants of Seville had been in the habit of retreating to the cool recesses of the cathedral to transact business. The building encloses a large central patio with ranges of two storeys, the windows set in slightly sunken panels between flat pilasters. Plain square tablets float in the space above each window. The building is surmounted by a balustrade, with rusticated obelisks standing at the corners. There is no sculptural decoration, only the discreetly contrasting tonalities of stone and stucco, and the light shadows cast by the slight relief of the pilasters against their piers, by the cornices, and by the cornice strips that cap each window. The building was begun in 1584 by Juan de Mijares, using Herrera's plans, and was ready for occupation in 1598, according to an inscription on the north façade. Work on completing the structure proceeded through the 17th century, directed until 1629 by the archbishop Juan de Zumárraga and finished by Pedro Sanchez Falconete. Researchers who wish to examine the archive's sources use another building located across the street. Contents View of the main courtyard. In 1785, by decree of Charles III the archives of the Council of the Indies were to be housed here, in order to bring together under a single roof all the documentation regarding the overseas empire, which until that time had been dispersed among various archives, as Simancas, Cádiz and Seville.Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra, How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2001, p. 170. Responsibility for the project was delegated to José de Gálvez y Gallardo, Secretary for the Indies, who depended on the historian Juan Bautista Muñoz for the plan's execution. Two basic motivations underlay the project; in addition to the lack of space in the Archivo General de Simancas, the central archive of the Spanish Crown, there was also the expectation, in the spirit of the Enlightenment, that Spanish historians would take up the history of Spain's colonial empire. It was decided that, for the time being, documents evolved after 1760 would remain with their primary institutions. The first cartloads of the documents arrived in October 1785. Some restructuring of the Casa Lonja to accommodate the materials was required, and a grand marble staircase was added in 1787, to designs of Lucas Cintara. The archives are rich with autograph material from the first of the Conquistadores to the end of the 19th century. Here are Miguel de Cervantes' request for an official post, the Bull of Demarcation Inter caetera of Pope Alexander VI that divided the world between Spain and Portugal, the journal of Christopher Columbus, maps and plans of the colonial American cities, in addition to the ordinary archives that reveal the month- to-month workings of the whole vast colonial machinery, which have been mined by many historians in the last two centuries. Today the Archivo General de Indias houses some nine kilometers of shelving, in 43,000 volumes and some 80 million pages, which were produced by the colonial administration: Fountain.

It is native to northeastern South America, where found in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, northeastern Brazil, and Trinidad and Tobago. It has also been introduced to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Grenada, and Dominica.. Despite the alternative name Brazilian agouti, it is neither the only nor the most widespread species of agouti in Brazil. In Brazil all agoutis are often called \\"cutia\\" . It is found in a wide range of forests, including rainforest and secondary forest. Description Red-rumped agoutis weigh about . They are about long. In this species the females are larger than males but otherwise look similar. They are brownish with darker spots on the upper body. The fur becomes more orange as it goes past (going down) the middle area of the animal. The ears are somewhat square in shape. The front feet have 4 toes and the back have 3. They can be distinguished from other agoutis by their distinct coloring. These animals have no distinct breeding season, and females generally have about 1 to 3 young. The gestation period is 104 to 120 days. On average, it takes 20 weeks for the young to be weaned. They live in pairs or family groups of the parents and little ones. They need large areas for food, breeding, and territory. It is hard to keep the animal in captivity for that reason. Most animals in the family Dasyproctidae mate once or twice, and this is presumed to be true for this species as well. This species lives 15-20 yrs in captivity.  References  * John F.
