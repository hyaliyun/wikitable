Taylor served in the Royal Navy during the First World War, and continued to swim competitively until 1926. His fortunes declined after he retired and he died penniless. His record of three gold medals at one Olympic Games ‚Äì the most by any Briton ‚Äì stood for 100 years until it was equaled by cyclist Chris Hoy in 2008. Tying the medal count of American Mel Sheppard, he was the most successful athlete at the 1908 Olympics. Early life Henry Taylor was born in Hollinwood in Oldham, Lancashire, on 17 March 1885 to James, a coal miner, and Elizabeth Taylor. Henry's parents died when he was young and he was raised by his older brother, Bill. Taylor learned to swim in the Hollinwood Canal, and practised in any water body he could find ‚Äì baths, becks, canals, lakes, etc., including the Hollinwood Canal and Alexandra Park's boating lake. Austin Rawlinson, who was Taylor's friend and later president of Amateur Swimming Association, recalled that Taylor \\"loved his swimming more than anything else in life\\".

He finished first in all of the races he took part in during the games bar one. After performing well in the heats of the 400 m freestyle, he finished second in the semi-final to Austrian Otto Scheff, who won the same event in the 1906 Intercalated Games.

He was the first man to hold the world record for the 1500 metres freestyle, a feat that he completed on 25 July 1908 in a time of 22:48.4 in London. His haul of three was the most gold medals won by any Briton at the Olympics. This feat was not repeated by any British participant in the Olympic Games for a century until Chris Hoy won three gold medals in cycling events at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Four years later, Taylor was selected for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. In the 4√ó200 m freestyle relay, he helped his team win bronze. There were no Olympic Games in 1916 because of the First World War. Taylor joined the Royal Navy in 1914 and kept fit by swimming around the ships when his ship was anchored at Scapa Flow. He was present at the Battle of Jutland. A popular story tells that during the course of the battle, his ship, HMS St. Vincent, was sunk and while the survivors waited for two hours to be rescued, Taylor swam around encouraging his crewmates. However, this story is probably a myth as HMS St Vincent was not sunk at the Battle of Jutland. He was transferred to HMS Ramillies where he remained until he was demobilised. After the war, Taylor returned to swimming. He took part in the Morecambe Bay Race, winning eight times over a period of 20 year and at one point held the record.

The Answer Man is a United States 15-minute radio program that aired from 1937 to 1956 on the Mutual Broadcasting System and also in syndication. It was broadcast late Sunday evening on some stations. During the 1940s, the program was sponsored by Trommer's White Label Beer. The Answer Man was Albert Carlyle Mitchell, who was born May 31, 1893 in Elsberry, Missouri. The series was created by Mitchell and Bruce Chapman. Questions submitted by listeners were answered on the air by Mitchell, and those who sent questions not used in the program were given answers by mail. The program's offices were located across the street from the New York Public Library, which helps to explain how Chapman and his staff (along with 40 helpers) were able to deal with a constant flow of nearly a million questions a year. They also kept their own specialized library of several thousands of volumes, and they created a card index of 20,000 authorities who could be consulted when all research avenues failed. The show was carefully scripted, yet it created the illusion that Mitchell was answering spontaneously. Many listeners believed that he was a genius with total recall of all information. Mitchell would often close an episode with a short poem that was relevant to a previous question and which provided a thoughtful and tranquil conclusion for the listener. Q&A; On New York's WOR, the program was heard twice a day from 1937 to 1952. Questions and answers covered every conceivable topic, from stain removal to legal advice. Typical questions: :*How tall was Jesus? :*What makes bubble gum bubble? :*Is it true that only the male cricket chirps? According to an article printed in the 1940s, there were two questions that the Answer Man was unable to answer: :*How many buffalo would it take to fill Grand Canyon? :*Do birds dream? The series was sometimes developed for individual markets, such as local versions in France, Germany, Greece, Holland and Poland, with Radio Luxembourg also broadcasting the concept in Europe. In Los Angeles, Joe Mansfield was the Answer Man. The spin-off quiz book, Here's the Answer by Albert Mitchell, was published by Miles-Emmett in 1946. Distributed by Dodd, Mead & Company, this book featured more than 2000 questions and answers, grouped by subject.

In Cantonese cuisine, it is usually served as a dim sum snack.Hsiung, Deh-Ta. Simonds, Nina. Lowe, Jason. [2005] (2005). The food of China: a journey for food lovers. Bay Books. . p 38. In addition to accompanying the Chinese diaspora, a variation of shaomai also appears in Japan (ÁÑºÂ£≤, sh≈´mai) and various southeast Asian countries. Popular Chinese varieties Mutton shaomai from Inner Mongolia In the Qing dynasty, the fillings varied by season: garlic chives in spring, mutton and pumpkin in summer, crab meat in autumn, and mixed seafood in winter. Many varieties have been created as shumai was gradually introduced to all provinces, where it was adapted to the different regional tastes throughout China. However, most people in Western countries associate siumai with only the Cantonese version due to the Cantonese diaspora. =Hohhot shaomai= Hohhot shaomai is a regional variety in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. The wrapping is a very thin, round sheet of unleavened dough, with a pleat border. There is only one kind of filling, which mainly consists of chopped or minced mutton, scallion and ginger. Hohhot shaomai features this extensive use of scallion and ginger, creating a dense combined scent, and a slightly spicy taste. The filling is put in the center of the wrapping and the border of the wrapping is loosely gathered above, forming a \\"neck\\" and a flower shaped top. It is then cooked by steaming or pan-frying. Hohhot shaomai is served in the unit of \\"liang\\", which means either eight steamed ones served in a steamer tier, or eight fried ones served in a dish. \\"Liang\\" is equal to 50 grams, being traditionally used as an indication of the total weight of the wrapping. Hohhot shaomai is commonly served with vinegar and tea, due to its greasiness. = Cantonese siumaai = thumb Cantonese siumaai This is the most well-known variety in the West, which is from the southern provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. As prepared in Cantonese cuisine, siumaai is also referred to as \\"pork and mushroom dumpling.\\" Its standard filling consists primarily of ground pork, small whole or chopped shrimp, Chinese black mushroom, green onion (also called scallion) and ginger with seasonings of Chinese rice wine (e.g. Shaoxing rice wine), soy sauce, sesame oil and chicken stock. Bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and pepper can also be added. The outer covering is made of a thin sheet of lye water dough, which is either yellow or white. The center is usually garnished with an orange dot, made of crab roe or diced carrot, although a green dot made with a pea may be used. The decorative presentations vary. A fish paste variety of siumaai is sold as a popular street food in Hong Kong, usually alongside curry fishballs. It is most often eaten with a sweet soy sauce and chili oil. =Hunan juhua shaomai= Called the chrysanthemum shaomai, this variety is made in Changsha, Hunan province. This shaomai is named for its opening resembling the chrysanthemum flower petal shape. It is spicy with pepper and the wrapper is translucent. The filling largely consists of glutinous rice, pork hash, shrimp, shiitake mushrooms bamboo shoots and onion. =Jiangnan shaomai= Shaomai prepared in the Jiangnan region (stretching from Shanghai to Nanjing) has a filling similar to zongzi from the region, containing marinated pork pieces in glutinous rice, soy sauce and Shaoxing wine, steamed with pork fat. It is larger in size than the Cantonese version. The Shanghai variation also contains shiitake mushrooms and onion. The mince, mushrooms and onion are stir-fried before being prepared as the filling. =Uyghur shaomai= In northwest China, the Uyghur people of Xinjiang adapted shaomai into two regional varieties. The southern Xinjiang recipes differ slightly from the northern version in terms of ingredients and method. The filling of the northern version consists of mutton or beef, along with green onion and radish, whereas the southern filling primarily uses glutinous rice with smaller amounts of mutton or beef. Minced meat from sheep ribs containing some fat is ideal. =Jiangxi Yifeng shaomai= Called the Yifeng shaomai in the southeastern Jiangxi province, this version's distinct flavour comes from a blend of pork mince, bread flour, sesame seed powder, ground pepper and sugar. It is particularly popular in the area of Yifeng Tanshan Tianbao where it is one of the foods eaten during the Chinese New Year celebration.  Variants from other countries  =Japanese sh≈´mai= Sh≈´mai in Japan have shrimp as the main ingredient and neither pork nor beef is used in the dough. Compared to Chinese shaomai in which the meat filling is usually minced, the meat in Japanese shumai is ground to a paste. =Indonesian siomay= Indonesian siomay is served with peanut sauce Siomay or siomai (sometimes called somay) in Indonesia is pronounced the same way as its sisters and is usually a wonton wrapper, stuffed with filling and steamed. It is served also with steamed potatoes, tofu, hard boiled eggs, steamed bitter gourd and cabbages, all are sliced and topped with peanut sauce and kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). Because the population of Indonesia is largely Muslim, pork siomay is rare and is usually made from various fish, most commonly wahoo or mackerel tuna. This variant is less common in Western countries. =Philippine siomai= Philippine siomai with Calamansi and siling labuyo Siomai (Visayan: siyomay) in the Philippines is often ground pork, beef, shrimp, among others, combined with extenders like garlic, green peas, carrots and the like which is then wrapped in wonton wrappers. It is commonly steamed, with a popular variant being fried and resulting in a crisp exterior. It is normally dipped in soy sauce with the juice of calamansi, a Philippine lime, and a chili- garlic oil is sometimes added to the sauce. A recent variant on siomai is wrapped in sheets of laver after the wonton wrappers, which are marketed as \\"Japanese.\\" =Vietnamese x√≠u m·∫°i= X√≠u m·∫°i in Vietnam has minced pork, onion, scallion and shredded bread as the main ingredients and is cooked in tomato sauce. It is usually served in a roll of b√°nh m√¨ for breakfast. Because the recipe omits dough wrappings, it is more akin to a meatball rather than shumai. History =Origin= Shaomai is considered to have originated in Huhhot, between the Ming and Qing dynasties. As described by historical materials, Shaomai was served in tea houses as a secondary product. The name was given \\"ÊçéË≥£/ÊçéÂçñ\\", meaning the product was \\"sold as a sideline\\", with tea. It is considered to have been brought to Beijing and Tianjin by merchants from Shanxi, causing its later widespread. The name was later transformed into modern forms like \\"ÁáíÈ∫•/ÁÉßÈ∫¶\\", \\"Á®çÁæé\\" and \\"ÁáíË≥£/ÁÉßÂçñ\\", changing the characters while keeping the original pronunciation. The product was initially in the form of meat and vegetables wrapped in thin sheets, and was sold weighing only the wrapper, a tradition which is still kept in Huhhot. Serving One serving of steamed traditional lamb shaomai, served with vinegar, in Huhhot. In Huhhot, Shaomai is commonly served as a staple food, especially for breakfast. It is considered a local delicacy in regions around Huhhot. Steamed ones are served in steam tiers, and fried ones are served in dishes, with usually 8 per serving. Vinegar is commonly used as appetizer. The dish is commonly consumed with tea. Within the dim sum tradition of southern China, shaomai is one of the most standard dishes. It is generally served alongside har gow, another variety of steamed dumpling containing shrimp, cooked pork fat, bamboo shoots and scallions; collectively these are known as hargow-sieu mai (). In food stalls in Indonesia, siomai (or \\"siomay\\" in local dialect) are eaten together with steamed vegetables and tofu, and served with spicy peanut sauce. In Philippine food stalls and fast food restaurants, siomai is eaten as is, with dip, toothpicks to facilitate handling, or with rice (using a spoon and fork).

Characters are grouped by the boxing gym they are a member of. Kamogawa Gym =Ippo Makunouchi= :Voiced by: K≈çhei Kiyasu (Japanese) and Steve Cannon (English) Ippo is the main protagonist of the series. His boldness as a boxer is juxtaposed with his shy and amiable personality outside the ring. He lives with his mother, Hiroko Makunouchi, and helps with the family charter boat fishing business‚Äîa job which has developed his lower body well enough to become an effective boxer. When he was young, Ippo used to get bullied and picked on by others in his school. As fate would have it, Takamura came upon Ippo as he was getting a beating from a couple of bullies and decided to help him. Takamura saw something in Ippo and introduced him to the world of boxing. After seeing a video of Tyson, Ippo becomes inspired to take up boxing to feel reborn with strength and asks Takamura to get him into Kamogawa Gym. Immediately after arriving at Kamogawa Gym he impresses Takamura and Kamogawa with his explosive punching power and guts in the ring. Like he has with Takamura, Kamogawa personally takes on Ippo as his pupil and starts him on the path to being a pro boxer. Since then, Takamura has treated Ippo like a younger brother and has taken him under his wing. Ippo is described as an in-fighter (though, he resembles more of a boxer-puncher) and is well known for his comeback KO victories, his Peek-a-Boo style defense and his heavy blows which include three signature punches: a rib-cracking Liver blow, Gazelle punch (an uppercut variant), and the Dempsey roll, modeled after punches used by Mike Tyson, Floyd Patterson, and Jack Dempsey respectively. He stands at 164 cm (5'5\\") tall with a 165 cm (5'5\\") reach and has consistently weighed 126 pounds (57 kg). His natural talents include stamina, balance and enough punching power to turn around a match instantly; combined with his superb fighting spirit, these assets lead to his comebacks victories and have allowed him to overcome any technical shortcomings. His destructive Dempsey roll technique has been a particular focus in the story and has continued to evolve through the series: in the match with Sawamura, he added a rapid stop-and-start to prevent it from being countered, and against Jimmy Sisfa, he incorporated an uppercut to the rotation, but Makunouchi needs to continue to develop his lower body to use these without risking further injury. He temporarily stopped using the Dempsey roll in order to refine his basics and become a more complete boxer. His nickname is the God of Wind, coined after the force of his powerful blows. In addition, his intense training has allowed him to mimic some fighters' specialities with a degree of success such as Sendo's smash attacks or Jimmy Sisfa's jolt attacks during their matches. During his fight with Sendo, Ippo showed the Dempsey Roll's perfect form. Since the Dempsey Roll could not be used if the opponent won't back down, Ippo utilized all three of his techniques. Starting with the liver blow, which damaged Sendo's right ribs, Ippo then used a feint with his own version of \\"Sakki\\"(killing intent), called \\"Courage\\", making Sendo raise his guard. Ippo then followed up with the Gazelle punch (an uppercut using the strength of the legs for additional power), which made Sendo's jaw fly up and stunned him for a few seconds. Taking the opportunity of Sendo being stunned, Ippo then revved up his Dempsey Roll which hit Sendo a couple of times before knocking him out. Ippo used the same pattern of attack on his first title defense with Sanada but due to the damage that he sustained his attack stopped after a couple of hits. Hajime no Ippo has covered each of Makunouchi's fights, starting with his introduction to the boxing world and winning the All Japan Rookie Kings tournament in a talented rookie Featherweight class (it has produced a four national champions and two OPBF Champions so far). The story continues with his ascension to becoming the Japanese Featherweight Champion, a title he has defended eight times. He's now begun his journey towards the world stage by challenging other national title holders in the OPBF. His current record as a professional boxer is 26 matches, 23 wins and 3 losses with all 23 victories by KO, and he holds the seventh ranking in the WBC. His only losses are to Eiji Date in his first attempt to challenge for the Japanese Featherweight title, Alfredo Gonzales, ranked #2 in the World, and to Antonio Guevara after making a 10-month comeback. Date would go on to challenge Ricardo Martinez for the world title but the injuries he sustained in his title bout forced him to retire and pass the baton to Ippo. Ippo's most recent fight was with Alfredo Gonzales for the #2 spot in the WBC World Rankings. While Gonzales dominated most of the fight, Ippo was able to knock him down and caused Gonzales to begrudgingly accept Ippo's strength. Gonzales won the fight after being luckily saved from a second knockdown by the ropes and caused massive damage to Ippo in his final attack. His objective is to defeat the current WBA Featherweight Champion Ricardo Martinez. In that respect, he decides to vacate his Japanese Championship in order to focus exclusively on the World Championship. Recently, Ippo's friends have realized that repeated blows to the head have given Ippo some degree of brain damage, and he has promised Kumi that if he loses one more time, he will retire. He was finally pitted against a new opponent months after returning to Japan unveiling a new Dempsey roll but lost due to fatigue. Ippo retired after this fight due to worry over punch drunk syndrome and injuries he sustained. He is currently being trained as a second at the gym while becoming a trainer at the same time. =Mamoru Takamura= :Voiced by: Rikiya Koyama (Japanese) and Eddie Frierson (English) Takamura is an undefeated two-time World Champion boxer for the Kamogawa gym. The other fighters there look up to him and feed off of his energy, and he's their unspoken emotional leader. Like a big brother, he teases them without tact and facetiously bullies them constantly, but he also gives them advice and helps them to become better boxers. Takamura also has an insatiable appetite for women, which is only overshadowed by his obsession for victory. At one point, he single-handedly knocks out an adult bear while sustaining gashes on his arm and chest. The weakened bear is eventually shot and killed by Nekota, and Takamura was dubbed \\"The Bear Slayer\\". Sometimes he honors the moniker by wearing the Bear pelt, bearing his scars proudly. During one of his title defense fights, (He was advised by Coach Kamogawa beforehand that he will soon be contending for the world as WBC is eyeing him already) Takamura defeated his challenger using only his left hand, starting from left jabs that evolved to left straights, proving the old adage \\"He who rules with his left rules the World\\" as stated by Mr. Nekota. This is Takamura's appeal to the world. The boxing commentator stated further that Takamura has proven that \\"Japan is too small for him\\". He originally was a delinquent who often got into fights. Because of his strength, he usually left his victims with serious injuries. He was disowned by his family due to a brawl he initiated with some fans who were booing his older brother in a rugby match. By the time the brawl was over, at least twenty people were injured. After the incident, Takamura continues to street fight until he meets Coach Kamogawa. After weeks of training, and without a single sparring session, Takamura defeats his first opponent twenty- five seconds into the first round. He works his way to becoming the JBC Middleweight Champion, and then moves on to defeat Bryan Hawk to become the WBC Junior Middleweight Champion, and then beats David Eagle for the WBC Middleweight Championship, and then beats Richard Bison to win the WBA Middleweight Championship and unify both the WBC and WBA Middleweight Championships (which makes him the only current World Champion from Japan). His current aspiration is to conquer the next four classes up through heavyweight, but first he must win his upcoming fight for a Super Middleweight Championship. Morikawa described Takamura as by far the best pound for pound fighter in the series. He's the ideal blend of both athleticism and technique, and intelligence and instincts. Morikawa often uses Takamura's keen insight to break down what is happening during a fight. Even before he started boxing, his strength, speed, stamina, and reflexes were already world class and he easily could have become a national champion. But despite his prodigious natural talent, his determination to achieve greatness has pushed himself to work tirelessly at his craft, and he suffered through painful weight control without complaint to reach the world stage. His character resembles former Middleweight Champions Sugar Ray Robinson, Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Roy Jones Jr. for his versatile repertoire of punches, his ability to box and brawl at any range, and his uncanny physical gifts. He is the former Japanese Middleweight Champion, the former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion, and the current unified WBC and WBA Middleweight Champion. Takamura currently holds a record of 26-0-0, with all twenty-six wins coming by knockout. =Others= : :Ippo's senpai and Kimura's best friend. Aoki provides much of the gym's comic relief and exercises one of the world's most unusual fighting styles. A few of his signature techniques include the fan-favorite Frog Punch, double punch, an untorqued (ineffective) corkscrew punch, and the utterly ridiculous Lookaway (which has also been adopted by Takamura). In the past, he and Kimura were the toughest high-school thugs around, but now Aoki's real job is at a ramen restaurant. Due to the numerous times being dumped by the pretty girls in high school, he's developed a taste for women with unattractive faces. He has fought for the Japanese lightweight championship, losing in a draw, and shares an apartment with his girlfriend, Tomiko, a friend of Kumi Mashiba whose nice personality and good body more than compensate for her less-than-stellar face. Aoki seems to be based on either former world champion Jorge P√°ez, or hardcore fight fan hero Emanuel Augustus for their offbeat fighting styles and records. His current record stands at 29 Matches 19-7-3 (W-L-D), with 12 KOs, and the best rank he reached is 1st in Lightweight. His signature \\"Look Away\\" technique is based on a skill former World Middleweight Champion Jake LaMotta had used in his career and his signature move the \\"Frog Punch\\" is based on real-life former world champion Koichi Wajima whose signature move was called the \\"Frog Jump\\". :Aoki is ranked 7th in JBC Lightweight rankings. : :Ippo's senpai and Aoki's best friend. He is the smooth, collected type and a romantic at heart, but trains as hard as anyone. His style incorporates a fast left and faster footwork and is considered by Miyata to have \\"no weaknesses\\" yet, it also doesn't have strengths either which creates Kimura's weakness. In the OVA, which was dedicated to Kimura, he is in training for his bid for the Japanese junior lightweight championship against Ryo Mashiba, he developed a devastating vertical combination known as the Dragon Fish Blow, which Kimura learned while watching his pet fish jump up and eat his meal in front of him. Another interesting fact is that, out of all the opponents that had fought Ryo Mashiba, Kimura is the only one Ryo had feared during a match. In the past, he and Aoki were the toughest high-school thugs around, but now Tatsuya's real job is at his family's flower shop. His current record stands at 24 Matches 17-6-5 (W-L-D), with 12 KOs, and the best rank he reach is 3rd in Jr. Lightweight. However, this rank was enough for him to get a title match, because the 1st & 2nd resigned from fear of Mashiba. :Kimura is ranked 7th in the JBC Jr. Lightweight rankings. After losing to Ryo Mashiba, he announced his retirement from boxing. Shortly after, unable to stay away from boxing, he returned saying he'd spell his name in katakana („Çø„ÉÑ„É§, Tatsuya) instead of kanji (ÈÅî‰πü,, Tatsuya). Kimura's character seems to be at least partially based on former world champion \\"Fearless\\" Freddie Pendleton, who had been a journeyman fighter his entire career, yet was still able to fight on even terms with some of the best in the world with his high level of skill. : :The most recent addition to the roster, the charming Manabu has a prodigy's talent and was the captain of his high school's boxing team. Cheerful and a lover of bad puns (as are the rest of his family), Manabu is a fierce hybrid boxer with extremely high speed and reflexes and whose fighting style is uncanny in its resemblance to Miyata's. His most powerful technique is a furious hail of mid- power blows known as the Hedgehog or Porcupine, which was employed in an East Japan Rookie Kings showdown with his longtime nemesis, Kyosuke Imai. Outside of boxing, Manabu is employed as an assistant at the Makunouchi family's fishing business. He has a big crush on Kumi but prefers to keep his feelings for himself because of his respect for his Idol Ippo. Itagaki's character is based on retired world champion Sugar Ray Leonard for his prodigy-like natural ability and good looks, whom Itagaki is said to be like in the manga. His current record as the Rookie King of his class stands at 17 Matches 15-2 (W-L-D), with 10 KOs. :Itagaki is currently listed as 3rd in JBC Featherweight and 5th in OPBF Featherweight rankings, also Itagaki is one of the speed square which consists of former 3rd and 5th seed, but now retired Saeki, Karasawa, and Fukui. He is currently aiming for Ippo's vacated Japanese Championship as Ippo seeks to aim for the world championship. :Recently, it's been shown that Itagaki has become quite smitten for Kumi, but he realizes the feelings aren't mutual. * : :Head coach and founder of the Kamogawa gym. He fought as a prizefighter in Japan shortly after the end of the Second World War. Along with his friends, Ginpachi Nekota and Dankichi Hama, Kamogawa developed a style of fighting that both presumably became the forerunner of boxing in Japan and emphasized scientific theory in its techniques. In his prime, Kamogawa's talents included the fearsome, yet self-destructive, Tekken (Iron Fist) blow which is a left hook body blow enough to knock someone down and an unyielding spirit which has been passed onto his students. As a coach, Kamogawa's wealth of knowledge and experience has been tapped into on multiple occasions during training as well as in matches. He may seem to be a bit gruff towards his boxers, but maintains very strong relationships based on trust and spirit; i.e., he rescued Takamura from his life as a thug by introducing him to boxing. Although he rarely admits it aloud, he is extremely proud of his two best reliable straight-forward boxers, Takamura and Ippo. :During Ippo's comeback fight, Coach Kamogawa was hospitalized due to over fatigue. Therefore not being able to teach Ippo a technique that would utilize both attacking and defending simultaneously. He was shocked during Ippo's match with Ponchai when, during the timeout after the first round, Ippo declares a Knock Out within the Second Round. Coach Kamogawa's pride was lifted up, however, when Ippo did the Dempsey Roll for the first time, not even knowing what it was called. :Ippo's matches with Volg and Sanada proved how tight the bond between the Coach and his athlete is. During Ippo's fight with Volg, Ippo made a remark to Kamogawa: \\"Amazing\\". Kamogawa thought that Ippo was referring to Volg's Power. Ippo stated \\"I followed everything you taught me during training and it's working.\\". During the end of the fight with Sanada, Ippo was sitting on the neutral corner due to the damage he sustained from the fight. Kamogawa reached out a hand to Ippo to let him up and Ippo stared in amazement at his Coach's hand, referring to it as \\"The hand that pushed me to exceed my limit\\". * : :The manager of Kamogawa Gym and a part-time trainer. Friendly and knowledgeable, \\"Yagi-chan\\" (as his pupils affectionately call him) is also in charge of securing match posters, selling tickets, and anything else involving the gym's finances. He knows a great deal about boxing himself, having been a boxer at Kamogawa Gym once. He usually is the one that handles the setting of matches often telling the boxers about their opponents. Yagi also accompanies the coach on various forays outside the gym trying to find strong opponents for their boxers. Additionally, although Yagi was not a skilled boxer nor a good second member, but he is a master fisherman who can outfish anyone. * : :One of the trainers at the Kamogawa Gym. Because he oversees the training of some of Kamogawa boxers, he is normally a second to some of them during their matches; in fact, he knows Aoki, Kimura, and Itagaki even better than the Coach does. Because of Aoki & Kimura's reputation for \\"mud slinging\\" matches, they would sometimes jokingly blame Shinoda for improperly training them and calling him the \\"Trainer From Hell\\". Shinoda almost resigned when he felt that he might not be able to draw out Itagaki's full potential. Kawahara Gym =Ichir≈ç Miyata= : :Makunouchi's idol and foil, Miyata is a very skilled outboxer with a cool demeanor that specializes in counter punches. Considered by many to be a boxing prodigy, he uses the same boxing style that his father used. After his father was forced to retire, Miyata decided to take on his style of boxing to prove its worth on the world stage. He begins at Kamogawa Gym, where he eventually meets Ippo and has a pair of spars with him. The first is a Miyata victory, but one where he's pushed unexpectedly hard by Ippo who had no fighting experience. He loses in their second spar and later transfers to Kawahara Gym in hopes of one day facing Ippo in an official match. At first, Miyata looked down on Ippo after he was embarrassed in their first spar, but grew respect for him over the next few months and now has developed a friendly rivalry. :Miyata was a highly touted rookie and enjoyed early success in East Japan Rookie Championship until he was defeated by Ryo Mashiba who stepped on his foot and sprained his ankle. After recovering and graduating high school, he tells Ippo that he's going on a tour through Thailand and Korea to improve his skills until he closes the gap between them. Miyata has trained all across the Pacific and eventually returns to the mainstream boxing scene as the main contender to the OPBF featherweight title. Together with the Jolt Counter, an effective full-body counter punch, Miyata KO'd Australian boxer Arnie Gregory to become the current regional champion. He has defended his title five times, all by KO, boosting him up to the fifth ranked Featherweight in the WBC. Most recently, Miyata defeated Randy Boy Jr., the OPBF interim champion who was crowned during Miyata's absence due to broken fists. :Unfortunately Miyata's 172 cm (5'8\\") tall frame is better suited for the Junior Lightweight or Lightweight class than Featherweight class; due to that, he tends to fight one match per month to keep his weight below the 126 lb featherweight limit. Despite the drain on his power and stamina, he endures without complaint for two reasons: the first is the hope of facing his rival Makunouchi, and the second is a tactical decision to achieve a \\"dry out\\", the effect of enhancing the body's senses and focus through strenuous weight management. In stark contrast to Makunouchi, Miyata has brilliant speed, technique and boxing intelligence, but he has a glass jaw like his father and lacks durability, power and stamina. To compensate, he uses high-risk, high-reward counters that require both great courage and precision. This means his style is more aggressive and more \\"soulful\\" than the typical outboxer who use hit-and-run methods like Itagaki. His speed and style have earned him the nickname \\"God of Thunder\\" or \\"Lightning God\\" and his punches are often referred to as the \\"Prince's Blade\\" for their sharpness. Miyata seems partially based on former world champions Sugar Ray Leonard and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. for his phenomenal skill, speed, and counter punching ability, though Morikawa has said in interviews that he also based Miyata on his personal friend, Naoto Takahashi, a former Japan and OPBF champion. :Miyata currently holds a record of 23-1-1 with 21 Knockouts and is the reigning OPBF Featherweight Champion. Writer Morikawa described him as the third best pound for pound fighter in his Hajime no Ippo universe, behind only Mamoru Takamura and Ricardo Martinez. * : :Suzuki is a veteran boxer in- fighter specialist who was ranked 2nd in Featherweight at the time Ippo entered the Class A tournament; he challenged Date Eiji in the title match and lost by TKO in the first round, also he lost in the Class A tournament Semi- Final against Volg Zangief very badly after which he retires due to his age. * : :Ichiro Miyata's father and coach, and the one who passed on to him the love of boxing. He is a former a Japan and OPBF champion and considered a world contender when he was in his prime. When Ichiro was a very young boy, Miyata lost his seventh OPBF title defense to Randy \\"Raccoon\\" Boy, father of Randy Boy Jr., in a fight where both fighters suffered severe career ending injuries (Boy would go on to challenge the world title, but wasn't the same and died soon after). Miyata himself shattered his jaw in the last round despite leading in the score cards, so he chose to retire despite having the chance to make a comeback. As a witness of his father's fall from grace, Ichiro decided to take on his style and become the best with it. Also during his reign as the champion of Japan, he defeated Sendo's trainer, Yanaoka. *'''''' : :Miyata's manager. Naniwa Gym =Takeshi Send≈ç= : Send≈ç is an aggressive mid-range fighter, and his specialty punch is the \\"Smash\\", Deadly Smash and Ultra Low Smash which was popularized and created by Donovan Ruddock. He resides in the Naniwa Ward of Osaka, where his is known as \\"Rocky\\" and the \\"Naniwa Tiger.\\" His \\"Rocky\\" nickname was influenced by his power boxing style similar to that of Rocky Marciano, the only heavyweight champion in history to retire undefeated. In a recent interview with Sh≈çnen Magazine, Hajime no Ippo's manga artist, George Morikawa said that Hidekazu Akai was also one of his models for Sendo. Like Sendo, Akai was from Osaka and was nicknamed the Naniwa Rocky. Sendo's mother died after childbirth, so he spent his first years with his father and paternal grandmother, raised under the motto \\"you should protect those around you\\". When he was around five years old, his firefighter father died while rescuing a boy about the same age as Sendo during a blaze. Sendo, proud of his father's sacrifice, continued to follow his advice by trying to help others. He started by helping people from bullies, but eventually became very violent with his \\"justice\\". By high school, Sendo had already become one o the most feared street fighters and gang leaders in Osaka, but not attacking people, rather defending the weak. One day, he beat up several boxers from Naniwa boxing gym, and met his coach, Yamaoka. He soon became interested in boxing, going on to win the Western Japan Rookie Championship. As a result, he was slated to fight Ippo who defeated Ryo Mashiba to become the Eastern Rookie King Champion, during the All Rookie King Japan Tournament. However, during the fight with Mashiba, Ippo injured his right hand and as a result decided to skip the fight with Sendo. After finding out Sendo literally goes out of his way to make Ippo change his mind and after seeing his determination to want to fight him so badly akin to his desire to want to fight Miyata, Ippo decides to go on with the match despite his handicap. In the end Sendo loses the fight by TKO, however despite this Ippo was left feeling that the battle hadn't been fully resolved, since he was clearly losing the fight and was barely able to walk when the 4th round was about to start but Sendo remained in his corner unconscious due to a punch that Ippo connected to his temple. Sendo has held the Japanese featherweight following a questionable win over Volg Zangief (that even Sendo himself didn't accept gladly) to decide who would take the Featherweight Championship vacated after Eiji Date retired, defending it twice by KO. Ultimately not only would he lose the title to Ippo in their rematch but as a result of Ippo's devastating punches, he was shelved due to Ippo cracking his ribs with body blows and Liver blows. Despite their Rivalry, and Sendo's desire to avenge his losses, he has become good friends with Ippo as the series has progressed. Following his recent comeback, Sendo holds a record of 21-2-0, with 20 KOs and is the former JBC Featherweight Champion. After several victories over highly ranked Mexican opposition, he becomes known as a 'Mexican Killer'. Sendou is ranked 5th by the WBA and declared his ambition to defeat the WBA champion, Ricardo Martinez albeit not before indirectly threatening Ippo's most recent opponent (and the boxer who handed the latter his second loss) Alfredo Gonzales, instructing his most recent knockout victim to inform Gonzales that he'll 'see him real soon.' Recently, George Morikawa released a 48-page one-shot manga focusing on Sendo before his time as a fighter. Sendo is based on legendary heavyweight world champion Rocky Marciano, whom Sendo admits he admires most, for his fearless style and passion for infighting. =Others= * :Sendo's Kouhai and equally as brash, though he is more polite towards Sendo. He joined the Naniwa Gym out of his admiration of Sendo and like Sendo, he was the West Japan Rookie King. Prior to boxing, Hoshi practiced Karate and would challenge other martial arts schools. He showed up at the gym one day and Sendo took his challenge. Sendo was the first man to stay standing from Hoshi's trademark move, the Ichigeki, a basic power punch from Karate thrown from the side of your body. Upon meeting with Ippo, he stated his plan of challenging Ippo right after he beat Itagaki for the Rookie King title, but he was unsuccessful and Itagaki won the match easily with his superior speed and reflexes. * : :A still young ex-boxer who works as a coach in the Naniwa gym. As a boxer, he was able to achieve being the number one contender of the Japanese title, but was unable to defeat the champion which is later revealed to have been Miyata's father. When Sendo attacked him and some rookie boxers, Yanaoka was the only one who could resist Sendo's attacks and could even see his weak spots as a fighter. Thanks to him, Sendo joined the Naniwa gym. Toho Gym * : :Known by ringnames such as the \\"Executioner\\" or \\"Shinigami (God of Death)\\" by those who watch his matches, Mashiba is one of the most intimidating boxers in the series. His greatest natural strength lies in his height of 177 cm and an incredible 187 cm reach. He effectively combines that inhuman reach with the Detroit version of the Hitman stance that was used by American boxer Thomas Hearns, who ruled 5 classes of boxing weights with this style, to create a devastating whiplike technique known as the Flicker Jab to eat away at his opponent's guard and resolve. Those fortunate and/or skilled enough to make it through his barrier- like Flicker still have to deal with his power-packed Chopping Right, which cuts down those who would deal damage up-close. Recently Mashiba has incorporated a devastating right uppercut into his repertoire, presumably to overcome his weakness to infighting. :After beating Miyata in the Rookie King Tournament semifinal (he even resorted to stepping on Miyata's foot to keep him close), he lost to Ippo in the final match. He later moves to Junior Lightweight Division where he reigns as Champion (defending the belt against Kimura in a very close match, amongst others) before losing to Sawamura by disqualification in one of the dirtiest, bloodiest matches ever seen in the series, due to Sawamura's dirty boxing and Mashiba's grudge against him. In that one match alone, almost all the fouls that could be committed were committed (by both fighters). In the end, although he manages to knocked Sawamura out (and out of the ring), Mashiba is ultimately deemed the loser by the referee for fouling. He is nearly off his year-long suspension and, according to his coach, is planning a title match for the OPBF Junior Lightweight Division. :Outside of the ring, Mashiba is a very quiet, if also very unnerving and scary figure who is spurred on to earn wages and box for prize money all to support both himself and his beloved younger sister, Kumi, orphaned after their parents died in a tragic accident many years ago; because of all his pain and the humiliation coming from others, Mashiba has developed a big resentment against the rest of the world, which only started to wear down after losing to Ippo; with time, he comes to not really mind the relationship Ippo has with Kumi (though he still keeps an eye on them whenever he can, watching for Kumi) and goes to his fights on occasion; he even entrusts Ippo to take revenge on Sawamura, who gave Kumi a cut on her cheek. After returning from a one-year suspension, Mashiba successfully moved closer to his natural weight by going to the Lightweight division, where he won the OPBF Lightweight Title in a grueling fight that ended in a come-from-behind knockout victory for Mashiba. He is currently ranked fifth in the world after taking the OPBF title. :As the reigning OPBF Lightweight Champion, Mashiba currently holds a record of 18-2-0, with 14 KOs and is the former JBC Jr. Lightweight Champion. His belt was lost to Ryuhei Sawamura, due to a disqualification on part of Mashiba's brutal attitude during the fight. Mashiba is based on former six-division world champion Thomas \\"Hitman\\" Hearns, for his exceptional height, reach, and use of the flicker jab. Otowa Gym * : :Known by the nickname \\"The Prodigy\\" he was a prodigy outboxer with incredibly fast punches, he is known for his \\"Shotgun\\", a barrage of fast punches intended to down his opponent quickly and decisively. Although he was a former Inter-High Champ, he lost to Ippo in the last second of the first round of the East Japan Rookie King Tournament. He later moves down to the Junior Featherweight Division where he becomes the JBC Jr. Featherweight Champion. Hayami's character is based on retired world champion Joe Calzaghe for his \\"Shotgun\\". After his loss to Kenta Kobashi for the Junior Featherweight championship, he retires from boxing due to his weak chin, seriously damaged in the fight with a one-two combination from Kobashi. He's an incredibly handsome fellow, very popular outside of boxing as a model and teenage idol, and has a legion of female followers who always cheer for him whether he wins or loses. *Alexander Volg Zangief : (See Foreign boxers) * :Voiced by: Yuichi Nakamura :The longtime rival of Itagaki Manabu, Imai was the one boxer who managed to thwart Itagaki in his high-school days. They fought a total of three times in the amateur ring; each time Imai was victorious. His build, KO pattern, and even hairstyle are remarkably similar to those of Itagaki's senpai, Makunouchi Ippo. Imai is ordinarily cool and composed, bearing a poker face even in the heat of battle. Eventually, Itagaki defeats Imai in a heated battle. It seems the only people who can rouse him out of this perpetual calm are Ippo, Itagaki, and Itagaki's sister Nanako -- with whom Imai is very much smitten. :He recently claimed the Japanese Featherweight Championship belt after a rematch with Itagaki, a title he has yet to defend. Kinoshita Gym * : :Handsome and highly intelligent, Sanada's full-time job is as a doctor at the same hospital in which Kumi works. Before moving up to the Featherweight division, he had a very successful reign as the JBC Jr. Featherweight Champion, defending the title five times. He is the pupil of Genji Kamogawa's old nemesis, Hama Dankichi, and in a fight, he uses his immense knowledge of human physical capabilities to predict his opponents' moves. His specialties include two of Dankichi's inventions: the ‚Äînamed after a model of highly maneuverable Japanese fight plane, it's an unpredictable left jab known in English as the Swallow‚Äîand the \\"Tsubame Gaeshi\\", a piercing double uppercut known in English as the Swallow's Return. After his failed attempt to obtain the Featherweight Championship from Ippo, he retires from boxing to continue his work as a doctor. Sanada's character is fairly reminiscent of mid-1980s boxer \\"The Fighting Physician\\" Dr. Terry Christle, who had been the Irish national Middleweight champion and chief sparring partner of Marvelous Marvin Hagler during his training for his super fight against Sugar Ray Leonard. Christle had earned his Ph.D at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, but before embarking on a medical career had wanted to give boxing a try, ultimately retiring in 1987. At the time of his retirement, Sanada held a record of 13-2-1 with 9 knockouts * :Sanada's . After Sanada's retirement from boxing, Karasawa wanted to bring glory back to their gym, and so challenged Ippo for the featherweight championship title. He planned to use his lightning-fast feet to evade the champion's punches and counter the Dempsey Roll, but was mercilessly KO'ed in the second round due to Ippo's choice to seal the Dempsey Roll and focus on a back-to-the-basics approach on boxing. Was the Rookie King the year before Itagaki and JBC Featherweight 7th Seed at the time he challenged Ippo. (v62 p185) Hachinohe Gym *, United States Army : :An African-American soldier stationed in Japan at Misawa Air Base, near Hachinohe, Osma proves a difficult opponent for Ippo in the first round of the Rookie King Tournament. While fearsome in fights, Osma's usual personality is almost unnervingly polite and outgoing. He boxes in order to earn money for his gym, his coach and his training partners, whom he treats like his own family. Osma wields an explosive hook equal even to, if not better than, Takamura's. * : :A bashful young man who first joined the Kamogawa Gym as Ippo's follower. His initial nickname was \\"Gero-michi\\" (a Japanese pun based on the fact that he threw up after every part of training). While in public he is awkward and uncomfortable, Naomichi puts everything into his training for his hope for strength and self-confidence. Having had to move away due to his widow mother's work, Naomichi now boxes for a different gym under the alias \\"Hammer Nao.\\" His specialty, a solar-plexus blow, was created when he challenged his former senpai and current Japanese featherweight champion, Ippo Makunouchi. Although he appears to front a cold personality as \\"Hammer Nao\\", he remains a very kind person at heart. He is also blessed with a very good singing voice. Yamada currently holds a record of 8-1-0 with 5 knockouts and is known to fight anywhere between Featherweight and his natural weight class of Junior Welterweight. Karil Gym * :Voiced by: Shinichir≈ç Miki (Japanese) :A boxer from Nagoya, Sawamura was introduced to boxing by a high school teacher who constantly tried to keep him out of trouble. As a child, he was abandoned by his mother after he attacked her abusive boyfriend with a knife. Sawamura's lust for violence carried over into his boxing career as well, and he shows no remorse for his almost criminal behavior. Nicknamed the \\"Owari Dragon\\", Sawamura is very lax about rules in the ring, and will perform illegal moves even if he has an advantage over the other boxer. His specialties include counterpunches and a deadly, twisting jab called the Bullet. He was involved in a car accident the night he won the fight against Ryo Mashiba to become the JBC Jr. Lightweight Champion and retired as champion having 14 fights with a record of 11-3-0 (W-L-D) with 5 KO. According to Sendo, Sawamura has become a trainer in Nagoya. Nakadai Gym * :Voiced by: Masaki Aizawa (Japanese); Tony Oliver (English) :At an age swiftly approaching thirty, Date is an old-timer for a boxer, but is nevertheless the man that Ippo looks up to. Years ago, he lost his World Title Match to the champion, Ricardo Martinez, who was defending his title for the 2nd time. He was knocked out in the 2nd round, and among other injuries, got a scar on the bridge of his then-fractured nose. :Date gave up boxing after that in order to settle down with his wife Aiko (a woman from a rich family who sacrificed a lot to be with him, and who just had a miscarriage at that time) and raise a family. But Date was a born boxer -- he found he could not contain his combative nature for long, and after Aiko told him that she wanted their son Yuuji to see his dad fight, he picked his career back up to the top. Date is strong in every way, but his greatest weapon is the Heartbreak Shot, a corkscrew blow to the heart that immobilizes the opponent. He is the first boxer to have defeated Ippo in the ring after Kamogawa threw the towel. :After this fateful match, Date went after the WBA title -- a rematch with Ricardo Martinez, who was making his 18th title defense -- but lost by K.O. in the 10th round. The injuries he received in this fight included broken hands and a fractured jaw, and seriously limited Date's chances of making a return to the ring. He has, however, passed on his dream to Ippo. Currently, he trains other boxers at the Nakadai Gym. Morikawa Jouji stated in an interview that Date was modeled after former OPBF Champion Ozaki Fujio. :At the time of his retirement, Date held a record of 23-2-0 with 17 KO's. He was the former OPBF Featherweight Champion as well as a two-time JBC Featherweight Champion and has twice been the #1 contender to Ricardo Martinez's WBA Featherweight Title. * :Voiced by: Hiroaki Hirata (Japanese); Tom Fahn (English) :Former Rookie King. Looked up to Date greatly, and tried to emulate him in every respect, going so far as to try to copy his fighting style. Lost to Ippo in the first round of what was billed as a battle of the Rookie Kings. Was Ippo's first fight after winning the Rookie King, jumping him immediately from 10th place, to 5th place, and getting him that much closer to being able to challenge Date for the Title. Nihon Gym * :Voiced by: Hiroyuki Yoshino (Japanese); Sam Riegel (English) :Won the Rookie King the year after Ippo. A fake southpaw. Sparred against Ippo before going on to face Sendou in what was Sendo's second title defense. Shigeta fights like a left-handed boxer, which disrupts most boxers because of the lack of left-handed boxers. In reality he is a right-handed boxer, which causes his attacks to be much stronger than they seem (since left-handed boxers tend to fight with the right hand in the front contrary to what right- handed boxers do.) He was destroyed by Sendou, who demonstrated a startling new speed and sas forced to retire after the title bout, since the sheer brutality of Sendou's power left him traumatized. Other boxers =Japanese boxers= * : :A handsome boxer with an admittedly unimpressive record of 3-3-0 (3KOs), Oda is Makunouchi Ippo's first opponent in the professional ring. Oda boasts a crushing right straight that easily knocked out his first few opponents; but it was soon revealed, to Coach Mikami's dismay, that he hated to train. Instead, Oda often chose to spend time with his girlfriend‚Äîthe coach's daughter, Reiko. Later, when he risked losing both Reiko's favor (she had heard how others mocked Oda for losing his fighting will) and the Nishikawa gym's support, Oda threw himself into training and regained the spirit of a boxer. Though he did lose to Ippo, due to the return of his old love for boxing he kept both Reiko's love and the trust of Coach Mikami. It has been revealed that Oda quit boxing after facing Ippo, satisfied with the fight he had. Since then he has felt \\"a weight lift from his shoulders\\" and ironically, is now rather obese without the need for weight control. * : :Fujiwara, an arrogant boxer with a body like a Mack truck and a forehead of stone, is Ippo's second opponent. When he realizes that Ippo is too much for him, he resorts to illegal headbutting to stun the young fighter. * : :Another amateur boxer turned pro, he was considered an Olympic hopeful while he attended the Toyou College of Athletics. The cheerful, confident Saeki is a skilled outboxer, nicknamed the \\"Speed Star\\" for his incredibly quick fists and feet; even Date couldn't touch him when they sparred. Saeki likes to dazzle his opponents with his fast footwork, then blindside them with volleys of punches. He has recently made a reappearance and will be competing in the upcoming Class-A tournament along with Takuzo Karasawa and even Ippo's kouhai Itagaki. * : :Kobashi stands as one of the lower key boxers, having entered boxing in the same class and year as Ippo. While both are openly shy and mellow in temperament, Kobashi does not share Ippo's skill as a boxer and resorts to duller tactics to attain victory in the ring. He trains at the Ohtaki Gym. In matches, he is known to throw together simple jabs, footwork, and clinching in a defensive style designed to win on points. Lacking destructive power in his punches, Kobashi has focused on less aggressive boxing and even utilizes a strong cross-arm block to hold superior attackers at bay. He almost defeated Ippo by taking points in the Rookie King Tournament, but was KO¬¥d in the last minute. He is a former JBC Jr. Featherweight Champion, (having defeated Ryuichi Hayami and ending his career), but has since retired without defending once to become a trainer. Incidentally, this is the name of real-life professional wrestler Kenta Kobashi; however the kanji for his real name is the same while the kanji for his ring name can be seen in the article on the wrestler (as well as the two being shown on the Japanese version thereof) * : :Known as the \\"Ry≈´ky≈´ Warrior\\", Shimabukuro hails from a small fishing village in Okinawa and trains at the Okinawa Seaside Gym. Though even shorter than Ippo, his body is like a steel fortress, bulky and cabled with muscle; and his strong lungs enable him to fight without having to breathe for many minutes. He longs to fight with Ippo in a great battle between men of the sea. He was the first challenger to successfully and seriously exploit one of the Dempsey Roll's weaknesses. * :A crafty, veteran boxer in his early thirties, from the Sameichi Gym in the Fukuoka Prefecture in Kyuushuu. He was ranked the 1st seed in the Featherweight Division when Date was the Champion his first time around. Take had challenged Date for the Championship back then, but had to pull out of the fight to look after his son, Hide, who had become seriously ill. After Hide had recovered, he was bullied because others thought his father was a coward for not fighting Date. Take then returned to the boxing world to fight for his son and had risen to the 1st seed again to challenge Ippo for the Championship. He's also the first southpaw boxer Ippo fights in a professional match. He could be considered a master manipulator and has a boxing style like Aoki. Ippo is able to KO him just 1 minute into the 6th round of Ippo's 7th title defence match. =Foreign boxers= * Jimmy Sisphar : :Also known as Scratch J, is a boxer from Thailand who was previously a Muay Thai champion, he has a very powerful right hook. He was the first boxer defeated by Miyata's Jolt Counter, while he was training in Thailand, as part of his travel to gain more experience. Sisphar comes back later in the series with his face full of scars and his speech slurred as Thailand's Featherweight champion to fight Ippo. In the fight, he reveals a devastating new blow that has the destructive power of a Jolt, without actually being a counter, named the Tornado Jolt. However, he loses by KO when Ippo uses a variation of the Dempsey Roll that uses an uppercut/smash instead of a hook. Jimmy Sisfer currently holds a record of 38-6 with all 38 wins by knockout and is based on former Junior Bantamweight champion Khaosai Galaxy who had defended his world title 19 times. * Alexander Volg Zangief : :A former Amateur World Champion, Volg is a boxer from Russia who excels at outboxing and taking points, but after he moves to Japan and enters the pro ring, he adopts a vicious infighting style that highlights his signature vertical combination called \\"White Fang\\" (a short left uppercut quickly followed by a fast and powerful chopping right). Raised by a single mother in a small town near St. Petersburg, Volg originally enters pro boxing in order to get her medical assistance when she becomes seriously ill (coincidentally, she looks a lot like Hiroko Makunouchi, but with longer and reddish hair). He's kind-hearted and polite, and at first takes little pleasure from using his fists to hurt others‚Äîeven Ippo notes his sad expression after his victories. He loses his fight in the Class A tournament with Makunouchi because of a lack of killer instinct and stamina, but seeing the determination with which Ippo fought would ignite his passion for boxing. He fights an inspired match with Sendo for the Japanese Featherweight title, but loses in a controversial decision and is forced to leave the Otawa Gym and return to Russia, where he would stay by his mother's side until her death. :Volg keeps a good friendship with Makunouchi and briefly returns to Japan to get his old boxing gloves from Ippo, who he ends up helping for his match with Sawamura. He decides to make a comeback in America, where he's currently training with Dankichi Hama and is now the IBF Junior Lightweight Champion. Since training with Hama, Volg has picked up Hama's 'Hien' technique and successfully combined it with his existing 'White Fang' into a new three-punch combination which has the potential to break through an opponents closed guard. It is possible that Volg is partly based upon Russian-Australian boxer and former undisputed Light Welterweight champion, Kostya Tszyu who excelled as an amateur in the Soviet boxing program before going on to achieve even greater success as a professional. * Ponchai Chuwatana :A boxer from Thailand, he is the first to fight Ippo in his comeback after his loss to Eiji Date. Little is known about him, leading Ippo to be nervous before their match. He was also the first boxer knocked down by Ippo's new weapon, the Dempsey Roll. * Arnie Gregory : :The former OPBF Featherweight Champion. An Australian boxer nicknamed \\"The Crocodile\\", his punches, especially hooks, are very powerful. He also uses a technique against counterpunchers called Bloody Cross. He was the OPBF Champion but lost his title to Miyata. He was KO¬¥d by Miyata's Jolt Counter when Miyata was almost done. He fired his manager, Mr Sakaguchi, before the end of his match with Miyata because of Sakaguchi thinking of boxing as nothing more than a way of making money and thus failing to understand the feelings of the fighters. * Ricardo Martinez : :The longtime reigning WBA Featherweight Champion, Martinez is considered the only active Super Champion in the world. Having made quick work of Date and sixty other unlucky opponents, Martinez is undefeated and seemingly invincible, as he demonstrated to Ippo in a one-sided sparring match. His strength, speed, ability, and reflexes are almost otherworldly. Martinez is also touted to have \\"the world's best jab\\", a jab with no shoulder movement and a very powerful snap. It is however implied, during his title match with Date, that Martinez and Ippo are equal in punching power. Though he rarely deigns to speak to his opponents, Martinez respects boxers who manage to last more than a round or two against him. The boxer he respects most is Date, as Date pushed him further than anyone else ever had in their rematch. Even so, Martinez's face was not even swollen up from their rematch, whereas Date's injuries were so bad that he had to retire. Martinez currently holds a record of 68-0 with 64 KO's. Martinez's style, demeanor, and career is based on retired world champion Ricardo Lopez, who defended the WBC strawweight title 22 times and is the third champion history to retire undefeated. * Bryan Hawk : :The former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion. A fighter of enormous build, Hawk is detested throughout Japan for his contemptuous attitude towards boxing, often bringing his personal entourage of \\"Hawk Girls\\" along to matches and other events. Raised in the toughest parts of New York, Hawk survived with his incredible talent for hand-to-hand violence. He uses unorthodox punches that are very hard to predict, in words of his own coach, Hawk's fighting style is not boxing, it's simply violence. He apparently derives even some degree of sexual pleasure from this violence. He loses the WBC Title to Takamura and retires from boxing due to the injuries received in the match. Like many boxers in the show before he boxed he was a street fighter. He grew up in the most dangerous parts of New York and fought until he was discovered by Miguel Zale, who ran a boxing gym. Bryan Hawk resembles former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion Ricardo Mayorga (who is often referred to as \\"The craziest man in boxing\\"), who is infamous for his hatred of training, wild swinging awkward punches, talent that had stemmed from a violent background, and borderline psychotic attitude. His upper body swaying, hands down stance, foot and hand speed also resembles former Featherweight Champion Naseem Hamed. * David Eagle :Voiced by: Hidenobu Kiuchi :The former WBC Middleweight Champion, and a fighter the complete opposite of Bryan Hawk in terms of both personality and fighting style. An orthodox hard puncher, he climbed undefeated to the top after only 17 matches, with 15 wins by way of knockout. His level of basic techniques is high and has great concentration due to his vast Olympic and amateur experience, where he was also undefeated. Eagle's greatest weapon is a highly polished one-two, which Takamura even admits is of the highest class in terms of power and delivery, as well as a great fighting spirit, that Takamura recognizes as one as great as Ippo's (The exact words were: \\"You know, Ippo? This guy looks just like you\\"). Eagle is pleasant and easygoing outside the ring, and shows excellent sportsmanship inside it. He loses his belt to Takamura. * Randy Boy Jr. :The former OPBF Interim Featherweight Champion who holds a victory over the Philippines Featherweight national champion and fellow countryman, Malcolm Gedoh. He is the son of Randy \\"Racoon\\" Boy, the boxer that forced Miyata Ichiro's father to retire from boxing. Because of this, Miyata decided to break his promise to Ippo by turning down their promised match in order to fight Randy Boy Jr. Like his father, Boy Jr. is a \\"Switch Hitter\\", an ambidextrous boxer who can smoothly switch stances from orthodox to southpaw during a match. His style has also given him the ring name \\"Asura\\" because of his ability to \\"go\\" and \\"see\\" anywhere in the ring. His switching is said nullify outboxers and counter punchers, because it creates a \\"static\\" that disrupts the rhythm and timing of outboxers. He's aiming to defeat Ricardo Martinez to become World Champion. It is revealed before his fight with Ichiro Miyata that his father died of brain damage he sustained after the fight with Miyata's father when he continued to box in a world title bout. He was beaten by Miyata after an intense fight which angered his manager to the point of nullifying their contract. * Papaya Dachiu :The lightweight champion of Indonesia who is noticed for his particularly odd-looking hairstyle. He fights using a lot of tricks, just like Aoki. His specialty punch is a tremendously powerful right straight called the Coconut Punch. He strengthens his right arm for his rematch with Aoki, making his Coconut Punch even more powerful. Papaya's weakness is a critical lack of stamina, which Aoki exploits in both of his fights with Papaya. Aoki has fought Papaya twice, with both matches ending in a draw. * Eleki Battery :The junior lightweight champion of the Philippines, Eleki also boasts an odd hairstyle with a lightning bolt shaved on top of his head. He is a skilled outboxer like Kimura. Eleki's weakness was his exceptionally weak body. He toughened up his body for his rematch with Kimura. Kimura has fought Eleki twice, with both matches ending in a draw. * Malcolm Gedoh: The reigning Philippines Featherweight national champion, a crooked fighter who offers to fix his fights in exchange for prize money. Prior to becoming a boxer, Malcolm stole money on the streets and it led to him getting shot and scarred on the shoulder. He's known as \\"The Magician\\" for the tricks he uses inside of the ring, such as the use his long arms to block one's vision while using good his footwork to get away from his opponent. Another trick is how he throws off an opponent's depth perception by loosening the strings on his left glove so that it flings off his unclenched fist, making his reach seem even longer. He managed to take Makunouchi to Round 8, which is further than any other opponent has taken Ippo. He was Ippo's last opponent, losing the fight after he is hit by a flurry of hooks and a powerful uppercut which sends him off his feet. After the fight with Ippo, Malcolm later confessed that his loss to Randy Boy, Jr. led him to give up his world aspirations and box only for the money rather than competition. * Woli :A boxing prodigy, Woli is the current Indonesian national champion, a title he won at the age of seventeen in just his third fight. He was discovered by famous boxing trainer Miguel Zail, the man who discovered Bryan Hawk. Before boxing, he was just an island man who played with the monkeys which helped him gain superb speed, reflexes and agility. In some respects, his style similar to Hawk in that he prefers a lowered guard, defending with a fast sway while throwing unorthodox and instinctive punches. Despite his lack of experience in both the pro and amateur ring, he has intuitively mastered various techniques including the Smash, flicker jab and creative uses of the ropes. His relaxed, almost playful demeanor in the ring allows him to instantly find more inspired ways to box. After sparring with him, Volg states he will soon be world famous and Zail believes he'll eventually be in the history books. Woli has a record of 3-1 with three KOs. His first loss came in his recent fight with Ippo, since Miguel threw the towel to avoid a KO. * Yi Yonsu :A Korean boxer who when he moved to Japan, grabbed the 5th rank in one fight, and challenged Ippo next. In what was Ippos 3rd title defense. The fight took place right before Takamura claimed the world title. Yonsu lost to Ippo in just 32 seconds. A 1 round KO. * Mike Elliot :The former IBF Junior Lightweight Champion. A boxer with a well-rounded skill set, Elliot is a calculating ring tactician who approaches his matches like a chess match, with the goal of outsmarting and methodically breaking down his opponents. As an amateur, he won a bronze medal for the United States at the Olympics but his loss in the Olympic finals, where an opponents sloppy brawling undid Elliot's cerebral style, motivated him to seek out challengers that could equal his ring intellect as a professional. He loses his IBF title against Volg; after getting hit by Volgs Hien/Fang combo, he loses his tactical advantage and the fight devolves into a desperate brawl which Volg barely wins. * Alfredo Gonzales :The #2 ranked boxer in the WBC Featherweight class, and a rival of Ricardo Martinez who has lost to twice. Gonzales grew up on the streets and originally had a very vicious style, but as he trained as a boxer began to develop a more technical style. However, he still uses his more violent style in certain situations. Gonzales longs for a rematch against Ricardo Martinez, and was angry at the idea of Ippo getting to challenge Ricardo in his place during their fight. Despite strong fighting from Ippo, Gonzales ultimately proved the victor. Other characters * :Voiced by: Masaki Terasoma (Japanese) :Ippo's deceased father. Not much is known about his past other than he was a fisherman who loved to get into fights, and that he had a powerful punch. He died when Ippo was much younger, saving his friend Sakuma in a storm. Ippo's mother said that Kazuo was more suited to be a boxer than Ippo was. In a flashback in volume 56, Kazuo said Ippo was weak and he was going to \\"train\\" him. It is unknown what training he was planning to put Ippo through. It is through his strategy that Ippo beat Miyata (When Kazuo was to fight a stronger opponent, he would picture his opponent as a fish and all the tension would go away). He also won his match against Iwao Shimabukuro with the same strategy. * : :Hiroko is Ippo's widowed mother. She is a very kind and strong willed woman who cares for her son a great deal. She started running the fishing business after her husband, Kazuo, died after saving his friend Sakuma. Though she refuses to attend any of Ippo's matches because she doesn't want to watch him get hurt, she supports his boxing wholeheartedly because she knows how much joy it has brought to his life and how it has helped him with his self-esteem. Since Kazuo's death, Ippo and Hiroko have been more or less alone in the world; so the strength of their family bond is no surprise. * :, Yuka Hirata (New Challenger), Saori Hayashi (Rising). :Kumi is Ryo Mashiba's sweet-natured, but hard-working and willful younger sister, and as such understands him better than anyone else. She will do almost anything to support her brother and make him happy, including going to his matches even though she doesn't like to see him get hurt. Ippo becomes infatuated with her early on, but didn't have a chance to tell her until more than a year later, when they met in an hospital as patient and nurse some months after the Ippo/Mashiba ring. They become friends and Kumi comes to like Ippo back, but their relationship tends to suffer from their friends' and relatives' constant interference, and also was somewhat strained after Ippo thought she was smitten with Dr. Sanada, until Kumi herself clarified the mistake after their match but didn't get a chance to say that Ippo was the one she really loved. Kumi tends to be modest and shy, but she will stand up for her brother and friends at a moment's notice. * :Voiced by: :Making his home a lonely shack up in the mountain forests, Nekota is Kamogawa's best friend of over fifty years. Occasionally, Kamogawa will visit him in the mountains, once taking Ippo and the others there to train for upcoming fights. While a meddling old geezer who tends to overstay his welcome, he is nonetheless loyal, good-hearted and trustworthy to the boys at the Kamogawa Gym. Nekota proved a far greater technical boxer than even Kamogawa; but as a result of their constant spars, he developed the beginning stages of punch-drunk syndrome. Despite this condition, Nekota took it upon himself to challenge an arrogant American military officer, Ralph Anderson, in a boxing match to boost Japanese morale. Though Nekota had the upper hand, Anderson won by throwing an illegal rabbit punch, which resulted in permanent mid-brain damage. * :Voiced by: Fumiko Orikasa (Japanese) :A beautiful young woman who adored sunflowers. Yuki met Kamogawa and Nekota at a boxing match in the 1950s. Smitten, they offered to put her up at Kamogawa's house to protect her from American soldiers. It was soon revealed, however, that Yuki was a victim of radiation poisoning from the American bombing of Hiroshima, and that she had come to Tokyo in hopes of living out her last days in happiness. When Nekota left Tokyo to live in the mountains, Yuki went with him; Kamogawa asked her to take care of his now-impaired best friend. Although‚Äîor perhaps because‚ÄîYuki had fallen in love with Kamogawa, she spent the rest of her life in the mountains with Nekota as per his request, dying peacefully some time later. * : :A former friend and rival of Kamogawa and Nekota. In his younger days, Hama boxed along with the two, but never managed to reach their level, partially due to his unusually fragile jaw. Nevertheless, he is a brilliant tactician who, since having left Japan for Mexico, is renowned for his successful training of several champions, including Sanada Kazuki. Hama still harbors deep feelings of rivalry towards Kamogawa, and strives to one day train a boxer that can defeat Makunouchi or Takamura. He is currently the trainer of Alexander Volg Zangief in America. * : :A classmate of Ippo's, Umezawa was the leader of a group of students who would regularly bully him. Together with his two flunkies, he made a habit of beating Ippo up, until the day that Takamura stopped him. After an initial failure to confront the fledgling boxer, Umezawa soon began to cheer Ippo on in his matches, and eventually took a job at the Makunouchi family fishing business to help out when Ippo's mother became ill. His ultimate goal, however, is to become a manga artist, and he eventually left his job to pursue it. In spite of all they went through in high school, the two are now the best of friends. * : :A reporter for a boxing magazine that has been following Ippo's career since his fights with Miyata. Occasionally he drops by with information concerning opposing fighters in upcoming matches for the Kamogawa gym members. * : :A 23-year-old sportswriter who works alongside Fujii. Iimura's calm indifference and sharp wit serve often to put off those who would judge her only for beauty, but she is an avid boxing fan and, though less experienced than some, an outstanding journalist. * : :Manabu Itagaki's younger sister. A flirtatious \\"genki\\" girl, Nanako is 16 years old and extremely interested in boys, harboring a particular taste for fighting men. She develops a crush on Ippo shortly after Itagaki introduces them, and finds herself competing with Kumi and Iimura for his attention. * : :A young female doctor whom Ippo asks for help after his match with Ryo Mashiba, since he sustained a serious injury during the fight but still wished to stay true to his promise to face Sendou. She develops a training menu to allow him to train and fight without causing excessive strain on his damaged bones. Yamaguchi is a very attractive woman with a beautiful and well-developed body, which at times distracts Ippo's friends (especially Takamura) from practice; but when her skills are needed, her efficiency and professional manner are admirable. Yamaguchi is also an expert in judo. *Mr. Sakaguchi : :A boxing promoter for the OPBF. He has a personal vendetta against Miyata for defeating his champion client Arnie Gregory. He is currently promoting Randy Boy Jr. as part of his revenge. He is short, high strung, and greatly resembles an Asian Don King. His nationality is unknown, but he can speak fluent English. Even his own boxers seem to dislike him as shown by Arnie firing him and Randy constantly ignoring him or telling him off. After Randy's loss to Ichiro Miyata, Sakaguchi nullified their contract. Shortly after Takamura's title defense the same night he accidentally struck Sakaguchi (who he thought was responsible for his less than stellar defense) and Sakaguchi has since stated that he will never return to Japan. Mr. Sakaguchi possesses some of the same mannerisms, personality traits, and even haircut as promoter Don King. * : :An older brother of Mamoru Takamura and a former Rugby Team member. In the midst of his defeat, his brother was kick-out to high school. Suguru see his brother again and said to him \\"if you defeat Bryan Hawk, I will give you a company and I will congratulate you if you a world champion.\\" Animals *: Hachi is Nekota's pet dog. He is a very friendly dog that goes wherever Nekota does. Nekota even snuck him into Korakuen Hall for Ippo's title fight against Sendo. *: Wanpo is one of Hachi's sons. Nekota gave him to Ippo soon after Ippo won the Japanese Featherweight Championship. His name is a combination of English and Japanese to form a pun on Ippo's name, which literally means \\"one step\\". One pronounced using Japanese syllables is . *Mountain Bear: While training at Nekota's place in the mountains, the Kamogawa troop were told to be wary of bears. When Takamura was out jogging once, he encountered a bear that he was able to KO after a life-threatening fight. He lets the bear go once he sees that it has two bear cubs following it. Nekota then later came upon the bear in its weakened state and shoots it to make a bear meat nabe that Takamura said he wanted to try, though Takamura was outraged when he found out. However, he decides to eat all the bear meat out of respect for the animal. Nekota later gave the bearskin pelt to Takamura, who fashioned an unusual ring robe out of it. *: An arowana fish that Kimura keeps in his room. The fish is apparently named after the girl Kimura liked when he went on the group date with the girls from the hospital. Unfortunately for Kimura, she did not return the feelings. It was the jumping this fish would perform when fed that led Kimura to develop his \\"Dragon Fish Blow\\" he used in his title fight against Mashiba Ryou.

In an effort to encourage settlers to move west into the new territory of Tennessee, in 1787 North Carolina ordered a road to be cut to lead settlers into the Cumberland Settlements ‚Äî from the south end of Clinch mountain (in East Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville). Peter Avery, a hunter familiar with the area, directed the blazing of this trail through the wilderness. He had the trail laid out along trails which the Cherokee Indians had long made their own and frequently used as war paths, following passages of buffalo. It led from Fort Southwest Point at Kingston through the Cumberland Mountains up into what is now Jackson County, Tennessee to Fort Blount. From there it worked through the hills and valleys of upper Middle Tennessee to Bledsoe's Fort at Castalian Springs, then to Mansker's Fort (near modern Goodlettsville), and finally to Fort Nashborough. These five forts provided shelter and protection for travelers along the Trace. First travelers on the Trace Photo from Mt. Roosevelt (Walden Ridge) showing terrain of the Cumberland Plateau In 1787, the Assembly of North Carolina provided 300 soldiers to be available for protection at the Cumberland Settlements. The soldiers assisted Avery in laying out the Trace, and each soldier was paid with a land grant of for one year's work. A wide trail was cleared. In that year, 25 families traveled along the new road. By 1788, the \\"Trace\\" was still merely a rough trail marked by trees scored (or \\"blazed\\") to guide the pioneers and travelers. For several years, only people on horseback and with pack horses could follow the rugged trail. Journals of many travelers along the Trace detail hardship encountered as they journeyed for several days to make the trip. The Trace was called the \\"Walton Road,\\" \\"North Carolina Road,\\" \\"Avery's Trace\\", and sometimes \\"The Wilderness Road.\\" Trace passes through Cherokee land Because a portion of the Trace passed through Cherokee land, tribe members demanded a toll for settlers' use of the road. Disputes inevitably arose over the toll. Despite colonists and Cherokees' agreeing on a treaty designed to settle these disputes, war was declared. As a result, Cherokees killed 102 travelers along the road. The North Carolina legislature ordered militia details of 50 men each to be maintained to escort travelers when large enough groups had gathered at the Clinch River to head west. In 1792 Americans built a blockhouse at the Clinch River. Territorial Governor William Blount placed many territorial militia on active duty under the command of General John Sevier, who based his operations at the blockhouse and began to provide armed escorts for travelers along the Trace. Trace widened to a wagon road A few years later, the North Carolina legislature ordered widening and improvements to the Trace to upgrade it to a wagon road. They raised funds by a lottery. As a wagon road, however, the Trace still offered bone-jolting travel. Pioneers were advised to keep a close watch on their horses, which Native American hunters occasionally stole. The war over the territory had ended, so travelers no longer feared for their lives. By the late 1790s, road conditions varied from \\"bottomless\\" to \\"fine and dry\\". Wagons often sank to their axles in mudholes. At places the Trace was covered with stone slabs, which made it difficult for horses. Much of the way was passable only on foot. Rivers and streams had to be forded. At Spencer's Mountain, now in Cumberland County, the road became very steep and full of rock slabs. It was reportedly so bad that wagons could not go down the mountain without the brakes on all wheels and with a tree hung on behind to slow them down. The mountain top was said to be \\"quite denuded of trees.\\" Families travel to the \\"Promised land\\" Detail showing the location of several late-18th century frontier forts (or \\"stations\\") in the Upper Cumberland River valley of Middle Tennessee. As rough and difficult as the road was, it was the major passage to the Cumberland Settlements. Lone travelers or pioneer families would load their possessions into wagons and meet fellow pioneers at the Clinch River. When the settlers had gathered, a militia detail joined them. They drive their horses across the Clinch River to start their journey into the unknown wilderness. Many believed they would reach a \\"promised land\\" at the end of their journey; many sought lands they had been granted for service to the new country. They faced a long and tortuous trail with many hazards. Pioneers camped along the way, cooking over campfires and sleeping under the stars. As the days wore on, they were occasionally fortunate enough to find families living along the Trace who gave them shelter and food for themselves and their horses, but these were few and far between. One traveler recorded that \\"the houses are so far apart from each other that you seldom see more than two or three in a day.\\" High prices were sometimes charged for any shelter or food. The land they traveled through was rich with beautiful hills and valleys full of canebrakes, giant trees and tangled vines. Many of those who made the journey described it as of wilderness ‚Äî one inhabited by wolves, mountain lions, coyotes, deer and buffalo herds. Along the Trace, settlers turned off for their individual land grants. By the last fort, Fort Nashborough, often only the militia remained. The soldiers usually picked up another group of settlers going back East. A traveler reported that families were constantly moving in and out of the area, \\"back to whence they came or onward to other settlements.\\" Notable travelers on the Trace Many notable people traveled along the Trace, among them Andrew Jackson, Judge John McNairy, Governor William Blount, Louis Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans (who later became King of France), Bishop Francis Asbury, French botanist Andr√© Michaux, Tennessee Governor Archibald Roane, Thomas \\"Big Foot\\" Spencer, and others. The Trace now stands as a testament to the travelers and families who had the courage to undertake such an arduous and difficult journey, in search of a new life for themselves and future generations.

Examples include phenylsilane (PhSiH3) and triethoxysilane ((EtO)3SiH). Bonding and structure The silicon-to-hydrogen bond is longer than the C‚ÄìH bond (148 compared to 105 pm) and weaker (299 compared to 338 kJ/mol). Hydrogen is more electronegative than silicon (hence the naming convention of silyl hydrides), which results in the polarization of the Si-H bond to be the reverse of that for the C-H bond. Generally silyl hydrides are colourless with physical properties (solubility, volatility) comparable to hydrocarbons. They can be pyrophoric, reflecting the great driving force for replacing Si-H bonds with Si-O bonds. Reactions and applications The dominant application of silicon hydrides is in the production of silicon films and coatings. Silane decomposes as follows: :SiH4 ‚Üí Si + 2 H2 This reaction is conducted by chemical vapor deposition, exploits the weakness of the Si-H bond. The second most heavily produced silicon hydride is trichlorosilane, HSiCl3. =Hydrosilylation= Silyl hydrides adds across multiple bonds in alkenes, alkynes, imines, and carbonyls. in hydrosilylation.

The student population grew rapidly when the 7th and 8th grade groups were incorporated to the 9-12 group in 2001, and since then, the school has been undergoing expansion in order to accommodate the growing number of students. In 2006, it was announced that an entirely new three-story section would be built where the previous school extension stood, and would be entirely dedicated to the 7th and 8th graders, thus separating them from older high school students. In addition to this, it was announced that a modern amphitheatre would be built inside, meaning that the previous theatre could be removed. This allowed the expansion of the cafeteria, which had been largely criticized for failing to accommodate the number of students over the years, and also allowed the addition of a new atrium, a gymnasium, and an exercise room. The gym was named after Olympian Lise Meloche. Although most of the construction was finished by the end of August 2007, the amphitheatre would not be opened until the beginning of spring 2008, costing in total a near twelve million dollars.

The house is of Palladian style, designed by the architect James Paine, with additions by Giacomo Quarenghi, who was a principal architect of the Imperial Russian capital city, Saint Petersburg. The building of the house was begun in 1769 and completed in 1776, with additional buildings being added in the 1970s and 1980s. From 1961 to 1990, it was the home of Cranborne Chase School, an independent boarding school for girls. New Wardour Castle is approximately from Old Wardour Castle, which was left as a landscape feature of the parkland of the new house. This was formerly the home of the Arundell family before it was besieged, damaged and slighted in the Civil War.  House  The building is constructed from limestone ashlar with hipped Welsh slate roofs and comprises a square main block with flanking pavilions. The north front has a rusticated basement below a piano nobile, with mezzanine and attic floor over. The house is described by English Heritage as \\"one of the finest Palladian houses in Wiltshire\\". It has a Roman Catholic chapel and a rare rotunda staircase. There are many painted ceilings and ornate fireplaces, typical of the building's period. =Rotunda= The ground floor of the rotunda is in limestone with black insets and a central black and white marble decoration. There are entrances from the north and south with double sweeping staircases on either side. The rotunda staircase was designed by James Paine and is round; the balustrade is fitted with glass candle lamps. The first floor has a wooden floor and has Corinthian columns supporting the ornately coffered, domed ceiling which is decorated with reliefs of musical instruments and a central light. The surrounding balustrade is made of fine ironwork with gilded flowers and a wooden handrail. Also on the first floor is an organ. =All Saints' Chapel= The Roman Catholic chapel, integral to the house, is known as All Saints Chapel, Wardour. It is also the Roman Catholic parish church. It was enlarged in 1789 by Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour, to the designs of John Soane. From its beginning, it served the needs of a substantial local recusant community and still holds regular Sunday masses. Due to its exceptional acoustics, it is also sometimes used for musical events. Pevsner describes the chapel as having \\"the size of a very major parish church\\" and being \\"grand in its decoration\\". By the entrance is a marble relief of the Virgin and Child, sculpted by P-E. Monnot in 1703; inside are giant fluted pilasters and a groin vault. The sanctuary added by Soane at the west end has Ionic columns and a domed ceiling with gilded plaster. The marble altar is by Giacomo Quarenghi, who later worked in Imperial Russia; the painting behind it is by Giuseppe Cades, and stained glass in the lunette window above is by Francis Eginton. Pevsner describes in some detail the important collection of vestments, dating from the 15th century onwards. Ownership of the chapel was transferred to the Wardour Chapel Trust in the late 1890s, and the running costs and maintenance of this Grade I listed chapel are now funded entirely through voluntary donations. Parkland and garden A Camellia house, with walled gardens, was built northeast of the house in 1769 by Richard Woods for the 8th Baron. Plans for the grounds were suggested by Woods in 1764, but these proved too expensive and in 1773 were revised by George Ingham. Capability Brown was then brought in and undertook extensive earth-moving and tree planting between 1775 and 1783. The current garden includes a ha-ha, and a walled garden with a swimming pool. There is a long driveway, which passes the 19th-century hexagonal annexe and leads to the rear of the building and the chapel. There is also a temple, built as a folly, in a distinct area of the grounds referred to as the Temple Garden.  Recent history  After the death in 1944 of John Francis, 16th and last Lord Arundell of Wardour, the building was leased and became the home of Cranborne Chase School. The school built new classrooms, studio dormitories and a dining-room extension on the south-eastern side of the main house, along with three staff houses to the west. The school eventually closed in 1990. In 1992 the house along with five cottages, six tennis courts, and a swimming pool in the walled garden, was sold for under ¬£1 million to Nigel Tuersley, and was converted into 10 apartments by designer John Pawson. The two main floors of the central block, incorporating the rotunda and the original state rooms, form the principal apartment. Extensions and ancillary accommodation added by the school were mostly demolished. The building was designated in 1951 by Historic England as a Grade I listed building, with its grounds later being Grade II* listed. It was used in the filming of the television mini-series First Born (1988), and in the filming of Billy Elliot, a film released in 2000. In 2010 Jasper Conran bought Apartment 1, planning to live between there and Ven House.

A municipality of the La Guajira Department since 1994, it has a population of approximately 17,014 inhabitants, the majority being workers of El Cerrejon coal mine. The town has an extension of 347 km2 and is located an altitude of 50 meters above sea level with an average temperature of 28 ¬∞C throughout the year. It is 75 km away from the capital of La Guajira Department, Riohacha. History =Coal mining= BHP Billiton and its joint venture partners, Anglo American and Glencore, became equal owners of the Cerrejon Zona Norte (CZN) coal mine in Colombia in February 2002, when they acquired International Colombia Resources Corporation (Intercor) from ExxonMobil, which held the mine's remaining 50 per cent ownership and operational interests. A new company, Cerrejon Coal Company, was formed, combining CZN and Carbones del Cerrejon. Situated within the mining lease is the village of Tabaco. The acquisition has proceeded in accordance with Colombian law. As part of the legal process, a survey was conducted to determine whether the people of the village wanted to sell their possession rights or be relocated. The survey established that there were 213 possession rights in Tabaco, of which 8 were municipal public properties, 151 were unoccupied lands or houses and 54 were occupied dwellings. Some 95% of the possessors said they did not want resettlement and wanted to negotiate directly. Subsequently, 192 out of 213 possession rights were settled; and acquisition of the 8 public properties was negotiated with the municipality of HN. In August 2001, the remaining 13 possession rights were acquired through an expropriation process ordered by national judges in accordance with the Colombian Mining Law. Court action was initiated on behalf of those people who had not agreed to sell their possession rights; and, in May 2002, the Colombian Supreme Court ordered that the municipality of HN provide primary education and housing infrastructure support for children of this group. While schooling is provided free to students, there are associated expenses for such items as educational materials. Following a review at the end of 2002, it was decided the funding should be provided directly to the schools attended by the children. Through the Fundaci√≥n Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar, assistance has been given to the school in HN for a cafeteria and to the school in Patilla for school furniture and materials.

Campbell (July 22, 1918 - February 21, 1998) was a carpenter and an American labor leader. He was president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America from November 1, 1982 to February 1988. Campbell was born in 1918 in New York City to Peter and Mary Campbell. His father was a city mass transit employee. He attended public schools. After graduation, he apprenticed as a carpenter. He married Catherine Keane in May 1940. The couple had two sons and a daughter. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, rising to the rank of staff sergeant and seeing combat action in the Pacific theater. After the war, he moved to Rockland County, New York, and joined Carpenters Local 964. He was elected president of the local in 1954. In 1955, he was hired by the international union as an organizer. In 1957, the international promoted him to staff representative, and he serviced contracts in Rockland and three nearby counties. In 1966, he was appointed assistant to the president of the Carpenters, Maurice Hutcheson, and elected a vice president of the union. He was elected to the general executive board of the 1st District of the Carpenters in 1969, and resigned his position as local president the same year. In 1970, Campbell was elected a vice president the New York State AFL- CIO and vice president of the New York State Building Trades Council. In 1974, he was elected second vice president of the international union. He was elected first vice president in 1980. Carpenters president William Konyha resigned unexpectedly effective October 31, 1982. Campbell was elected to succeed him. In 1983, Campbell initiated a boycott of the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, accusing the company of failing to pay fair wages to 1,500 lumber workers represented by the union. The company broke from an industry-wide bargaining group, which had agreed to an 8.5 percent wage hike over three years. The action triggered a strike on June 24, 1983.\\"Carpenters Launch Boycott of L-P,\\" United Press International, December 16, 1983. But the company outlasted the union, and the Carpenters affiliate at Louisiana-Pacific disbanded.\\"Strike Against Weyerhaeuser Ends,\\" Monthly Labor Review, September 1986. Between 1985 and 1986, Campbell allegedly authorized six construction loans totaling more than $95 million. The loans were made from the union's $200 million reserve fund. According to press reports, Campbell made the loans based on advice from Empire Contract Consulting Inc., a New York firm that also serviced and monitored the loans. Developers began to experience trouble repaying the loans in 1987, but Empire Contract Consulting did not make the union aware of the problems until 1989.Swoboda, \\"Carpenters Union Could Lose $95 Million,\\" Washington Post, September 20, 1989.

Description Main dancer of the Singkil, depicting a Maranao princess. Singkil originated from the Maranao people who inhabit the shores of Lake Lanao. It is a re-telling of an episode from the Maranao epic legend Darangen involving the rescue of Princess Gandingan (abducted by diwata) by the legendary Prince Bantugan. It is a popular dance performed during celebrations and other festive entertainment. Originally only women, particularly royalty, danced the Singkil, which serves as either a conscious or unconscious advertisement to potential suitors. The dance takes its name from the heavy rings worn on the ankles of the Muslim princess. A kulintang and agung ensemble always accompanies the dance. The female lead dancer plays the role of Princess Gandingan of the Darangen epic, wearing the heavy rings around her ankles to keep time while she dances. In an episode of the Maranao epic, the princess is caught in the middle of the forest during an earthquake caused by the diwatas (or the guardian spirits) of the Kingdom of Bumbaran. The diwatas abducted the princess and entrapped her into a forest to teach the philandering Prince Bantugan a lesson. The falling trees during the earthquake (which the princess gracefully avoids) are represented by the bamboo poles arranged in a criss-crossed fashion and clacked together in a unique, syncopated rhythm. During the performance, the female lead dancer graciously steps in and out of the bamboo poles as she manipulates two elaborately designed fans called apir. Another female dancer represents the loyal slave of the princess who accompanies her throughout the ordeal. After a while, a male dancer, representing the legendary Prince Bantugan of the Darangen epic, performs his dance round and through the bamboo poles clacked together bearing a shield and a sword. The entrance of the male dancer symbolizes the arrival of Prince Bantugan who is determined to rescue the princess from the diwatas. Other dancers skillfully manipulate the apir fans, which represent the winds which prove to be auspicious. The dance steps require agile movement so that the dancer's feet won't be crushed by the moving bamboos. Meanwhile, the clacking bamboo poles represent the forces which the two characters had to overcome. The dance ends with the princess going home with the prince. Adaptations =Bayanihan= When the Bayanihan Dance Company began performing the Singk√≠l, the traditional dance was adapted to convey Western aesthetics. The Bayanihan portrayal, branded as the Princess Dance or the Royal Maranao Fan Dance, became so popular that it is often mistaken for the authentic version of the dance. A notable variation from the original is its inclusion of male dancers, as pole clappers and in the role of the Prince, Rajah Bantugan. Additional sets of criss-crossing bamboo poles were also added. Further adaptation divided the dance into four movements: *First movement ‚Äì \\"Asik\\", where the slave with umbrella is introduced. *Second movement ‚Äì entrance of Putri Gandingan, the entourage of female fan or scarf dancers, and the arrival of Rajah Bantugan. *Third movement ‚Äì Patay, which is a slow section, and is a structural dance convention often found in Western performances. *Fourth movement ‚Äì the climax in which all dancers dance to the crescendo of music. =Other versions= PCN (Pilipino Cultural Night) festivities held by foreign-based student groups and other theatrical dance companies have modernised interpretations of the dance, resulting in unorthodox portrayals of the Singk√≠l by even the most esteemed of Philippine folk dance choreographers. The Philippine Barangay Folkdance Troupe portrays the prince dancing scarves rather than with a sword and a shield. Some dance companies have even fused the Singk√≠l with ballet, or make use of multiple layers of overlapping bamboos.  In film The Singk√≠l was performed in the 2001 American independent film The Debut. The movie was directed by Filipino American filmmaker Gene Cajayon and starred Dante Basco. The film captured the essence of Filipino traditions and the blending of these with modern American culture.

The music can be played from a CD or, in less common cases, performed by a live band. The U2charist was initially started in the U.S. Episcopal Church but has been adapted by several other denominations. It is typically a liturgical service (including communion) that features the music of the rock band U2 and a message about God's call to rally around the Millennium Development Goals. The U2charist is held by supporters to be a great opportunity to reach out to people in their congregations and larger communities, especially young people, with messages of global reconciliation and justice for the poor and oppressed. Bono, U2's lead singer, has been a particularly vocal proponent of the Millennium Development Goals, and has been proclaimed as a global MDG ambassador. The U2charist seeks to raise awareness of the MDGs and call people worldwide to a deeper faith and engagement with God's mission. History Although churches have used U2's music in liturgy for many years, the first U2charist was designed by Sarah Dylan Breuer in 2003, with the service held in Baltimore, Maryland, in April 2004. Breuer was a contributor to the book Get Up Off Your Knees: Preaching the U2 Catalog (Cowley Publications, 2003), and was inspired to create the U2charist by her reflection on spiritual themes in U2's music as she wrote her contributions to the book.Episcopal Divinity School The service spread quickly by word of mouth and over the Internet, particularly after the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland held a U2charist at their conference for all diocesan clergy in October 2004, after which many clergy present held U2charists with the assistance of the \\"Without Walls\\" worship team throughout 2004 and 2005, with the St. Mary's Outreach Center in Baltimore, Maryland, where the U2charist first took hold, as its base of operations.http://www.ang- md.org/convention_2005/2005-post-conv-journal.pdf After consulting with Breuer, the Rev. Paige Blair, rector of St. George's Episcopal Church in York Harbor, Maine, along with several of her parishioners, held her first U2charist on Sunday evening, July 31, 2005. Since that time, Blair has appeared numerous times in the media as an advocate for the U2charist. Since the U2charist began in 2004, it spread quickly around the world, with services being held in numerous countries, including a ‚ÄúU2-dienst‚Äù (U2-service), started by the Rev. Jan Andries de Boer from Broek op Langedijk in the Netherlands in 2006., as well as services in Australia, Italy, and Mexico. The first U2charist in England took place on 26 May 2007 at St Swithun's Church, Lincoln Diocese with the Bishop of Grantham presiding.Christianity Today http://www.christiantoday.com/article/u2charist.to.hit.england.for.the.first.time/9316.htmBBC http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2007/05/08/u2charist_listen_feature.shtml The U2charist Project in Lincoln was still running these services in 2011, alongside a variety of other social justice projects.

Tuberon's chief work Writings on the Present Age (Commentaria temporum suorum) was first published in 1603 and was printed a few times. This historical work chronicles the history from the death of king Matthias Corvinus in 1490 until the death of Pope Leo X in 1522.

W. Hooley\\", Nature 111: 817-817 (16 June 1923) ) was a businessman and amateur paleontologist, collecting on the Isle of Wight. He is probably best remembered for describing the dinosaur Iguanodon atherfieldensis, now Mantellisaurus. Isle of Wight Regular visits to the island resulted in the find of hundreds of fossils among which several major specimens on which he, from 1900, published fourteen scientific papers. He described remains of many turtles, and named the dinosaur Iguanodon atherfieldensis and the pterosaur Ornithodesmus latidens. Hooley was a member of the Hampshire Field Club & Archaeological Society at Winchester from 1890. He was one of the founders of the Isle of Wight Natural History and Archaeological Society. He was an honorary curator of the Winchester Museum between 1918 and 1923. Career Reginald was born in Southampton, the son of William Hooley, a wealthy gentleman. In 1889 R.W. Hooley began to work for Godrich & Petman, wine merchants, and later in life became managing director of that firm. Living in Portswood, in 1912 he married E.E. Holden and moved to Winchester. In 1913 he was elected a member of the Winchester city council. Hooley made his most famous finds in 1889 and 1914 when two iguanodontid skeletons were exposed by erosion at the cliffs. In 1904 the remains of \\"Ornithodesmus\\" were uncovered by a cliff fall. After Hooley's death, the paper naming Iguanodon atherfieldensis was posthumously published and most of the Hooley Collection, over 1330 specimens, was, in 1924. acquired by the British Museum of Natural History which displays the iguanodontid skeletons in the Dinosaur Hall.T.A.

He was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on February 11, 1987 and was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 20, 1987. He assumed senior status on June 30, 2000. Education and career Greenberg was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1933 but moved to Atlantic City, New Jersey, at a young age. Greenberg is Jewish.Jews in American Politics By Louis Sandy Maisel, Ira N. Forman, Donald Altschiller pg 456 After graduating high school, he attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1954. He then attended Yale Law School, where he received a Bachelor of Laws in 1957. At Yale, he was a member of the Yale Law Journal. After leaving Yale, he moved to Trenton, New Jersey, and began working in the Office of the New Jersey Attorney General during the administration of Democratic Governor Robert B. Meyner, where he remained until 1960. In 1960, he left the Attorney General's Office and entered private practice in Cape May, New Jersey. From 1970 to 1971, he was the County Attorney for Cape May County, New Jersey. In 1971, he returned to the Attorney General's Office as the Assistant Attorney General for the State of New Jersey. In 1973, he was appointed a judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey. He served in the trial divisions‚Äîfirst in the law division then in the chancery division‚Äîuntil 1980, when he was appointed as a judge in the New Jersey Appellate Division. Federal judicial service Greenberg was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to fill a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated by Judge Leonard I. Garth on February 11, 1987, and was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 20, 1987. He received his commission on March 23, 1987, and assumed senior status on June 30, 2000. Notable decisions =Kreimer v. Morristown= Richard R. Kreimer, a homeless man residing in various public places throughout Morristown, New Jersey, filed a pro se complaint in the District Court of New Jersey, claiming that his expulsion from the Joint Free Public Library of Morristown and Morris Township was unconstitutional, as it violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court accepted Kreimer‚Äôs arguments, holding that the library‚Äôs rules and regulations (especially those requiring proper hygiene) violated the First Amendment as they were unconstitutionally overbroad and unconstitutionally vague. The library‚Äôs policies violated the Fourteenth Amendment by making unconstitutional distinctions between patrons (i.e. against homeless persons). In an opinion delivered by Judge Greenberg, the Third Circuit reversed, finding that libraries are \\"limited public fora.\\" Given that the library would not have been open without the consent of a majority of voters, the municipality had an interest in assuring the library would be used for its intended purpose; \\"the communication of the written word.\\" Libraries, by nature, are meant to be places of quiet thoughtful writing, reading or contemplation, and policies designed to protect the intended uses of libraries do not violate the constitution. Any patron who disrupted others and prevented them from using a library to the fullest extent through their actions or inactions (e.g. inability to maintain public hygiene standards) could be subject to expulsion. =Dissent in LePage's v. 3M= LePage's sued 3M for anti-trust violations in a case involving 3M's product scotch tape, which 3M had a monopoly over. LePage's asserted that 3M was \\"bundling\\" its products together in order to maintain its advantage in the tape market. LePage's won a jury verdict, and 3M appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The court heard the case en banc, with Judge Dolores Sloviter writing the opinion affirming the verdict for LePage's. Judge Greenberg dissented from the full Court's opinion. He argued that companies should be able to give rebates to volume purchasers and that the majority was simply punishing 3M for being more efficient than LePage's.Lepage's v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2003) (en banc). He was joined in his dissent by Chief Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica and then- Judge (now Justice) Samuel Alito. =ACLU v. Mukasey= In 1998, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction forbidding the U.S. government from implementing the new Child Online Protection Act. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually upheld this injunction on appeal. This preliminary injunction, however, only lasted until a full trial could be held. In 2007, the full trial was completed, and the district court ruled the law unconstitutional. The government appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit, in an opinion written by Judge Greenberg, held that the law was not \\"narrowly tailored\\" to achieve its purpose of protecting children from pornography. For example, web publishers would have to incur \\"high costs\\" in order to avoid prosecution, even when web publishers only served adults. The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from Judge Greenberg's ruling, making his decision the last word as to the constitutionality of the law.

It was named after the Chumash Indian word for \\"clams\\", most likely due to the millions of petrified prehistoric clamshell fossils that are found in the surrounding areas. The town is home to the majority of the utility infrastructure for its residents, including nearby neighbor Cuyama, California. New Cuyama is located very close to the intersection points for Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Ventura and Kern counties. The town is served by Highway 166 (connecting U.S. Route 101 and Interstate 5) and the public-use New Cuyama Airport. The population was 517 at the 2010 census. History The area was considered territory of the Yokuts people, but Chumash Indians from the Pacific Coast are also known to have frequented the area. The imprint of an old Indian trail can still be seen leading over the hills of present-day Ventura County to the headwaters of Piru Creek. The name \\"Cuyama\\" comes from an Indian village named for the Chumash word kuyam, meaning \\"clam\\" or \\"freshwater mollusk\\". The area's recorded history dates to 1822, when Mexico won independence from Spain and took over the Spanish colony of Alta California. Two Mexican land grants, the Rancho Cuyama (Lataillade) and Rancho Cuyama (Rojo), were granted in the 1840s by Governors Manuel Micheltorena and P√≠o Pico in the lower Cuyama Valley along the Cuyama River, where present-day New Cuyama is, privatizing ownership of the land. Following the 1949 discovery of oil at the South Cuyama Oil Field, in 1952 the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) settled and developed the town of New Cuyama, building housing and associated commercial business ‚Äì including the New Cuyama Airport (L88), reopened in May 2015,http://generalaviationnews.com/2015/05/16/new-cuyama-airport- reopens/http://sbaero.com/2015/05/10/l88-new-cuyama/ which bears the distinction of being the only public-use paved airport within easy flying range of Los Angeles for more than . Much of the infrastructure from ARCO's settling of the town still exists today and is used by town residents. The original ARCO-built gas processing plant is still in use and easily seen due south of New Cuyama, though ARCO has since sold off interest in the facility.San Luis Obispo County High Point Trip Report The town of New Cuyama, at its founding, was considered the pearl of eastern Santa Barbara County, due to the flow of oil that was coming out of the region. During this time Richfield Oil Company built the town funded schools and provided all the important utilities other than electricity. Now that oil and gas production have declined, the principal industry is once again agriculture.  Geography  New Cuyama is located at (34.947933, -119.68915). It is situated in the Cuyama Valley.

History =Movietone Studio= William Fox, President of the Fox Film Corporation, had worked with inventor Theodore W. Case to develop a method for capturing sound on film eventually becoming the Movietone sound system. In August 1926 the Fox-Case Corporation was created, making $200,000 worth of improvements to what had been the Fox Annex, a warehouse at 460 W. 54th St. (Fox Films New York ran out of the giant building at 850 Tenth Avenue, around the corner. It eventually became DeLuxe, and is now Independence High School). Fox-Case at first devoted its efforts to developing talking Movietone News newsreels. On April 30, 1927 (six months before Warner Brothers ‚Äúdebuted‚Äù the talkies with ‚ÄúThe Jazz Singer‚Äù), the first talking Fox Movietone subject debuted in New York; it was a sensation. By the end of 1928, Movietone was churning out four talking newsreels a week, and a string of film shorts soon thereafter. The March of Time documentary film series began in rented space on the second floor from 1934‚Äì1936. Fox Movietone newsreels ceased production in 1963, but by then the studio had become popular for film and commercial production. Among the features made there: Miracle on 34th Street (1947), On The Waterfront (1954), Middle of the Night (1959), Fail Safe (1964), The Pawnbroker (1964), The Group (1966), The Owl and The Pussycat (1970), Where's Poppa? (1970), Shaft (1971), and The Exorcist (1973). Fox leased out the complex to various independent film and television producers such as, A.B.T. (‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Best Television‚Äù) Productions (1949) with such TV series as Inner Sanctum, The Reporter, and I Spy produced at the location. The famous \\"I Love New York\\" ad was filmed there in 1978. Printed records are murky on precisely when Twentieth Century Fox divested itself of the property. =Sony= In 1968, Manhattan Sound Studios ran a short-lived \\"Manhattan ‚Äò54\\" operation there. After this it appears to have been bought by Camera Mart, who leased shooting space at ‚ÄúStage One‚Äù and ‚ÄúStage Two‚Äù until at least 1980. For one brief year, 1979, Stage One became a major dance and ballet performance space. Camera Mart owned the property until selling to Sony in 1993. On November 18th 1993, Nirvana recorded their unplugged set at Sony Music Studios in New York City. The complex hosted the first US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire for ABC in 1999 (on a one- day delay), before the current syndicated version and occasional specials moved to ABC-owned studios farther north on the West Side of Manhattan. Other programs recorded or aired live from the Sony Music Studios included MTV Unplugged (including MTV Unplugged in New York, 1993 by Nirvana ), Sessions at West 54th, Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn and VH1‚Äôs Hard Rock Live. Sony Music was also home to the current version of the word game Chain Reaction, hosted by Dylan Lane. Millionaire and Chain Reaction, both packaged by Michael Davies, are the only two daily national quiz shows currently produced in New York. Sony Music Studios also hosted America: A Tribute to Heroes, a live telethon held 10 days after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The special also featured segments from CBS Television City in Los Angeles. Neither location was disclosed before air time because of security concerns. On June 7, 2007, after a buyout attempt by Sony Music Executive Vice President/Studio Head Andy Kadison stalled, Sony BMG Music Entertainment announced that it would be closing the studios. The building sold in November 2007 for $44 million, and it has been razed to be replaced by luxury condos. The last television production housed by the studio was Grand Slam, another Michael Davies and Embassy Row production, hosted by Dennis Miller.  Offices  Sony Music was international. Some of its worldwide offices include: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dubai, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, and Venezuela.  Major labels   Artists  This company is responsible for the development of many well-known artists such as Michael Jackson, Beyonce, Alicia Keys, John Legend and other international artists such as Romeo Santos and Maluma. Before the recording studio ended in 2007, some classics songs were recorded there including: *Shakira - \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" *Destiny's Child - \\"Lose My Breath\\" *Marc Anthony - \\"I Need to Know\\" *Mariah Carey - \\"Anytime You Need a Friend\\" *Michael Jackson - \\"Who Is It\\" *Jennifer Lopez - \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\\" *Elton John & Tim Rice - \\"Alda\\" *Britney Spears - \\"Radar\\"  References  *\\"Courtney Love: Kurt Cobain Broadway Musical 'Very Likely' to Happen\\".

The population of Natuashish at the 2016 Census was 936, up from 931 in 2011. Initial reports suggested that the Canadian government's plan of renewal and healing had been a failure, as the community was still plagued with alcohol and drug abuse. The government was accused of creating a system overburdened with bureaucracy, and not adequately addressing the issue. The local tribal band was accused of corruption, as was shown in a 2005 CBC report in which it was shown that the leadership was trafficking drugs and other illicit substances to maintain power. The community's attempt to resolve its problem with alcoholism led to a ban on the sale, purchase, and possession of alcohol within the reserve. The bylaw was originally passed in 2008 by a margin of two votes.The prohibition bylaw was upheld in a subsequent referendum held in the community in March 2010. The community continues to struggle with drug abuse and youth boredom. As recently as 2017 gas sniffing by youths has been a notable issue.

Its principal products are soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride and associated alkaline chemicals. History The original company was formed as a partnership in 1873 (becoming a limited company in 1881) by John Brunner and Ludwig Mond. They built Winnington Works in Northwich, Cheshire and produced their first soda ash in 1874. In 1911 it acquired soap and fat manufacturer Joseph Crosfield and Sons and Gossage, another soap company that owned palm plantations. A few years later it sold the soap and chemical businesses to Unilever. In 1917, the company's trinitrotoluene (TNT) factory in Silvertown, London exploded having caught fire. In 1924 Brunner Mond acquired the Magadi Soda Company of Kenya and in 1926 Brunner Mond was one of the four main companies ‚Äì along with British Dyestuffs Corporation, Nobel's Explosives Limited, and the United Alkali Company ‚Äì which took part in the merger which created the massive industrial combine Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). Alfred Mond ‚Äì son of Ludwig and Chairman of Brunner Mond ‚Äì was a key figure along with Harry McGowan of Nobel's in bringing this merger about. The Brunner Mond business was absorbed into the Alkali Group of ICI, becoming one of the largest and most successful companies in the world (ICI acquired Crosfield and Gossage's chemicals business from Unilever in 1997.) The Alkali Group became the Alkali Division in 1951. This merging with the Runcorn-based General Chemicals Division in 1964 to form Mond Division. This became the Soda Ash Products (Group) of ICI Chemicals and Polymers from 1986 until divestment. World War I memorial plaque, now at Sandbach Cemetery During the early 20th century the company built managers' and workers' houses in Hartford, Cheshire. In 1991 Brunner Mond Holdings Limited, rapidly listed, was formed by the British and Kenyan soda ash businesses of ICI. In 1998 this corporation gained the soda ash production capabilities of Akzo Nobel in The Netherlands to form Brunner Mond B.V. This expanded, three-base, form was later re-acquired by its parent company. Brunner Mond acquired British Salt, a Cheshire-based brine supplier, in 2010 for around ¬£93 million. This vertical acquisition gave longer term raw commodity price certainty and an economy of transport distance for one of the company's largest factories. The company was bought by Tata Chemicals in 2006. In April 2011 Brunner Mond was re-branded Tata Chemicals Europe.

It was named for its adjacent fjord, itself named for English explorer, John Davis, who in 1587 charted the region as part of ongoing efforts to find the Northwest Passage to the Pacific. The residents of Davis Inlet were relocated to the new community of Natuashish, away, in 2002. Settlement The community developed around 1924 during a period of sparse caribou populations when the Innu began spending their summers along the shoreline of Davis Inlet. This location was chosen because of its accessibility, its offering of other non-caribou food sources, and the presence of a trading post, operated by the Hudson's Bay Company, that was able to supply traps, ammunition, tobacco, butter, sugar and flour to the Innu in exchange for furs. Davis Inlet was also frequented by Roman Catholic missionaries, whom the Innu found helpful. In the following years the Innu began the process of sedentarization, transitioning from a nomadic lifestyle to a more sedentary one, travelling inland to hunt caribou in the fall and winter, but spending the summer at Davis Inlet. Without prior consultation the Newfoundland government, promising better opportunities for fishing and hunting, oversaw the 1948 relocation of the Innu of Davis Inlet to the small community of Nutak in northern Labrador.'By Innu, for Innu‚Äô However, two years later the Innu surprised government officials by returning to Davis Inlet, having made their way back through the interior of Labrador on foot. The government continued to consider relocation of the Innu, and in 1967 with the urging of government officials and missionaries the Innu of Davis Inlet moved and settled on Iluikoyak Island on a year-round basis, establishing the Davis Inlet community (known as Utshimasits by the Innu). Social problems Problems with the new site for the Davis Inlet community began as early as 1969. Settling on Iluikoyak Island inhibited the ability of the Innu to continue their traditional means of providing food by hunting caribou on the mainland and the community struggled adapting to its new-found dependence on store-bought food. Iluikoyak Island is solid rock, and because working the rock was seen as too expensive, the houses provided by the government for settlement were made without basements or water supply network and sewage systems. The houses were also small, poorly constructed, and not designed to house extended families. It was soon discovered that water supply on the island was insufficient, and most of it contaminated. Waste began to pile up, and diseases such as tuberculosis began to appear. Many of the adults in Davis Inlet battled alcoholism and on Valentine's Day, 1992, six unattended children aged between six months and nine years died in a house fire while their parents were drinking at a Valentine's Day dance.Valentine‚Äôs Day tragedy in Davis Inlet About one-quarter of all adults in Davis Inlet had attempted suicide in the previous year, and between 1973 and 1995, there were 50 alcohol-related deaths in the community of 465. As a result of the February 1992 fire, the Mushuau Innu and Innu Nation held an internal enquiry published as Gathering Voices: Finding Strength to Help Our Children.Labrador Innu - Chronology of Events Inhalant abuse was another problem in Davis Inlet, with 47 children being recognized as chronic abusers of solvents, some as young as age 5. In 1993, a video (recorded by Simeon Tshakapesh who later served as Chief of Davis Inlet) was released to the media of 6 children in Davis Inlet between the ages of 11 and 14 huffing gasoline in an unheated shack in winter and shouting that they wanted to die.The Innu of Labrador: From Davis Inlet to NatuashishHorror in Davis Inlet Shamed by the negative publicity and international outcry surrounding the events in 1993, the Canadian government agreed to move the Innu to mainland Labrador, and in 2002 at a cost of nearly $200 million the community of Davis Inlet was relocated to Natuashish. However, the problems of suicide, alcohol and solvent abuse followed the community and in 2008 they voted to outlaw alcohol entirely. The prohibition bylaw was upheld in a subsequent referendum in March 2010.CBC, \\"Natuashish votes to keep alcohol ban\\", March 26, 2010 In December 1993, the Mushuau Innu Band Council banished a provincial court judge and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) from the community. The public reasoning for the expulsion concerned Innu dissatisfaction with the practice and application of the Canadian Criminal Code to its people. The Innu also stated that the RCMP did not have jurisdiction over their community.Davis Inlet boots out RCMPDavis Inlet stalls return of judge The standoff continued until March 1995 when a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Government of Canada and the Mushuau Innu Band Council to establish Indigenous police officers to assist the RCMP.Swearing in of Innu Peacekeepers as supernumerary constables in Davis Inlet In November 1999, international Indigenous rights organization Survival International released a report on the Labrador Innu entitled Canada's Tibet: The Killing of the Innu. The report called the Innu of Davis Inlet \\"the most suicide-ridden people of the world\\".Davis Inlet: World‚Äôs most suicide-ridden people In November 2000, Davis Inlet, along with Sheshatshiu, took the unprecedented step of asking the Canadian federal government to step in and assist with a local addiction crisis.The political rhetoric of social problems: gasoline sniffing among the Innu of Labrador In 2001, 35 Innu children from Davis Inlet were sent to the former Grace Hospital in St. John's for treatment for gas sniffing.Innu children must be treated at home, says doctor According to paediatrician and geneticist Dr. Ted Rosales, who served on the treatment team in 2001, approximately 24 of the youths were diagnosed as having FASD (fetal alcohol spectrum disorder).

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The church moved to a new building in 1955, and the building has changed hands several times since. It is currently the home of the Provincetown Public Library. History Evolution of Provincetown Landmark: * 1860 - Center Methodist Episcopal Church * 1958 - Chrysler Art Museum * 1974 - Center for the Arts * 1976 - Provincetown Heritage Museum * 2005 - Provincetown Public Library The church was built in 1860. It was said to be the largest church of Methodist denomination anywhere in the United States. It cost $22,000 to complete, and had room to seat 900 people in 128 pews. The original spire was 162 feet tall and contained a huge bronze bell cast by George Holbrook in Eastmeadow, Massachusetts, according to a history of Provincetown Methodists done in 1995 by the Provincetown Methodist congregation's 200th Anniversary Committee. The steeple was weakened and damaged in the Portland Gale, and so a new steeple, restored in 2007, was reduced to be 100 feet off the ground. Yet, according to the Provincetown Banner, the local newspaper: =Chrysler Art Museum of Provincetown= In 1958, the building was sold for $40,000 to Walter P. Chrysler Jr. ‚Äì the son of Walter Chrysler, the founder of the Chrysler Corporation ‚Äì for use as the Chrysler Art Museum of Provincetown. During this period he collected many works by local artists. In 1962, however, his collection became embroiled in a scandal in the art community. That summer, the museum housed an exhibition from his collection entitled \\"The Controversial Century: 1850‚Äì1950\\". Out of the 187 works displayed, 90 were claimed to be forgeries by the Art Dealers Association of America. Among the declared fakes were works purported to be by Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh (4 of the 5 shown), Pierre Bonnard and Paul Klee. Most of the suspect works had been purchased over a two-year period from two New York dealers. Mr. Chrysler defended his acquisitions and their veracity, saying, \\"I don't make any claim for their being the greatest examples of each artist, but we can't look at masterpieces all the time. I think that would be rather dull.\\" Chrysler continued to run the museum with limited success until he closed it in 1970. In 1971, he moved his collection to Virginia, where it is still operating today as the Chrysler Museum of Art. There are differing accounts as to the reason for the move. According to the Museum's website, \\"The efflorescence of paintings, sculpture, artifacts and glass soon outgrew its limited quarters in a 19th-century church, however, and Chrysler began seeking a new home for the works.\\" The people of Provincetown remember it differently, however. The local newspaper reported it differently, saying, \\"Discouraged when the Town of Provincetown would not help him find parking for visitors to the museum, Chrysler packed up his collection and moved...\\" Whatever the reason, the building was sold in 1974 for $90,000 to The Rose Dorothea =Heritage Museum= Through the efforts of the Provincetown Historical Association and the Historic District Study Committee, the building was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places. It received certification in October 1975. Subsequently, in 1976, a special town meeting voted to acquire the building for $135,000, and it was sold to the Provincetown Historical Association and used for the display of town artifacts as the Provincetown Heritage Museum. The Provincetown Heritage Museum officially opened to the public on July 4, 1976. Half-scale replica of the Rose Dorothea, inside the Provincetown Public Library (the former Center Methodist Church) The Rose Dorothea A major addition to the building came about in 1977, during the Heritage Museum's stewardship. That addition is a half-scale replica of Provincetown's Grand Banks fishing schooner, the Rose Dorothea. On August 1, 1907, the Rose Dorothea won the Lipton's Cup, despite breaking one of her masts, in the first and only Fisherman's Race, a 42-mile race from Provincetown to Gloucester to Boston. The original vessel was sold in 1916 to a Newfoundland company that used her to ferry salt and other supplies to Portugal. In February 1917, a German U-Boat submarine surfaced next to the schooner as she neared the coast of Lisbon, and then, after allowing her crew to evacuate in lifeboats, sank her. Sixty years later, in 1977, construction began on the replica fishing schooner, and it was dedicated on June 25, 1988. The completed model spans a 66'6\\" length and a 12'6\\" beam. The original vessel was 108.7 feet long, weighed 108 tons and had a crew of 26 men. The Center Methodist Church is the most prominent building in this part of Provincetown center. =Provincetown Public Library= The Heritage Museum operated on a seasonal basis with a minimal staff and a group of volunteers through the summer of 2000, and in 2001, the Town voted to convey this property to the Provincetown Public Library. In 2002 renovations began to convert the building into the Provincetown Public Library. Upon completion the Provincetown Public Library would move into this building from another historic building, the old Provincetown Public Library, located several blocks up Commercial Street. The Provincetown Public Library website set forth the plans: As a part of the process, the Town was faced with another decision ‚Äì the choice of keeping the Rose Dorothea and incorporate it into the new library, or the choice of removing it, thus destroying it in the process. It was decided to keep the schooner intact, and the interior of the library can be seen in the accompanying photo.

An Australian Kangaroos and Queensland Maroons representative, he played in the Canberra Raiders' 1st, 2nd and 3rd grand final victories. Background Steve is the eldest of the three Walters brothers (Kerrod and Kevin), but was the last of them to gain Australian Test selection honours. Playing career Walters was born in Rockhampton, Queensland His family relocated to Ipswich, QLD when he were a young boy. It was there that he started his playing career for the Booval club. He then played in the Brisbane Rugby League for the Norths club. In 1986 Walters made his Winfield Cup debut with the Canberra Raiders. He played for Canberra at hooker in the 1987 NSWRL season's grand final loss to the Manly Sea Eagles alongside his brother Kevin. Walters played for Canberra at hooker in the 1989 NSWRL season's first ever premiership victory over the Balmain Tigers alongside his brother Kevin as well. He then traveled with the Raiders to England for the 1989 World Club Challenge, playing hooker in their loss to British champions, Widnes. Walters was selected by Queensland to play at hooker for game I of the 1990 State of Origin series, being replaced by his brother Kerrod for games II and III. Walters played in the 1990 NSWRL season's grand final at hooker in the Raiders' victory over the Penrith Panthers. Walters was selected as Queensland's hooker for all three games of the 1991 State of Origin series, being named man-of-the-match in game II. He was then selected as Australia's hooker for all three games of the 1991 Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand. The Canberra Raiders reached the 1991 NSWRL season's grand final and Walters played at hooker in the loss to the Penrith Panthers. Walters was selected as Queensland's hooker for all three games of the 1992 State of Origin series.

He was then selected as Australia's hooker for all three games of the 1993 Trans- Tasman Test series. For the 1993 NSWRL season Walters was named Rugby League Week's player of the year. Walters was selected to play for Queensland at hooker in games I and III of the 1994 State of Origin series. He was then selected as Australia's hooker for the 1994 French rugby league Oceania tour's sole test match. alters, with the Canberra Raiders, reached the 1994 NSWRL season's Grand Final, in which he played at hooker in the victory over the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. During the 1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France Walters played all three Ashes Tests at alongside his brother, Kevin Walters at . Steve was also man-of-the-match in Australia's victory over Great Britain in the third and deciding match of the series. Due to the Super League War Walters, along with many of his Canberra team-mates, was a notable exclusion from the 1995 State of Origin series, 1995 Trans-Tasman Test series and 1995 Rugby League World Cup. He was selected by Queensland to play at hooker in games II and III of the 1996 State of Origin series. 1996 was his last season with Canberra before moving to the North Queensland Cowboys. During the 1997 North Queensland Cowboys season Steve Walters captained 8 games. He played another season in Townsville before a final season with the Newcastle Knights in 1999. Retirement In 2000, Steve was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league. In February 2008, Walters was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.

He was a cousin to author Samuel L. Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain). He has a town named after himself which is in Marshall County West Virginia. Biography Born in Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), Clemens was appointed a cadet to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, but resigned after six months. He graduated from Washington College in Washington, Pennsylvania and was admitted to the bar in 1843, commencing practice in Wheeling. He was elected a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives to fill a vacancy in 1852, serving until 1853. Clemens was later elected back to the House in 1856, serving again from 1857 to 1861. He was not favorably impressed by Abraham Lincoln, whom he called \\"a cross between a sandhill crane and an Andalusian jackass.\\" \\"He is vain, weak, puerile, hypocritical, without manners, without moral grace, and as he talks with you he punches you under your ribs.\\" Clemens also wrote, \\"He is surrounded by a set of toad eaters and bottle holders.\\"Bruce Catton (1961), The Coming Fury, 1967 reprint, New York: Pocket Books, Ch. 4, \\"Two Presidents\\", Sec. 5, \\"Pressure at Fort Sumter\\", p. 249, [italics as in Catton], . During the Civil War, he opposed secession. He was a member of the Virginia Convention in 1861 and afterwards resumed practicing law in Wheeling. He attended the First Wheeling Convention from May 13-15, 1861, but actively opposed the partitioning of Virginia into two states.Curry, Richard Orr, A House Divided, A Study of Statehood Politics and the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia, Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pg. 128 Clemens later moved to St. Louis, Missouri and resumed practicing law until his death there on June 30, 1881. He was interred in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis. Clemens fought a duel with O. Jennings Wise, the son of Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise. Wise was uninjured in the duel, but Clemens received a severe injury to his right testicle.

It usually also focuses these particles (concentrates them) into a smaller area. ESA‚Äôs are typically used as components of space instrumentation, to limit the scanning (sensing) energy range and, thereby also, the range of particles targeted for detection and scientific measurement. The closest analogue in photon optics is a filter. Radial cylindrical analyzer Electrostatic analyzers are designed in different configurations. A simple version is a radial cylindrical analyzer, which consists of two curved parallel plates at different potentials. Ions or electrons enter the analyzer at one end and either pass through the other end or collide with the walls of the analyzer, depending on their initial energy. In these types of analyzers, only the radial component of the velocity of a charged particle is changed by an ESA since the potential on the plates only varies in the radial direction if one considers the geometry in cylindrical coordinates. Poisson's Equation can be then used to calculate the magnitude of the electric field pointing radially inwards. The resultant inward-pointing force generated by this electric field will cause the particles' trajectories to curve in a uniform circular motion. Depending on initial energy (velocity), only certain particles will therefore have the \\"correct\\" motion to exit the analyzer by tracing its physical structure, while others will collide into the walls of the instrument. In addition to the energy, the angle of entry will also affect the particles' time-of-flight through the analyzer as well as exit angle. In practice, the plates are usually oppositely charged and at very high potentials. Also, the inner surface of the analyzer, usually made of aluminum for space missions, is sometimes plated with black chrome or even Ebonol C to absorb stray light, instead of allowing it to bounce its way through. Face- field cylindrical energy analyzer The Face-Field Cylindrical Energy Analyzer is a very new class of electrostatic cylindrical energy analyzers. It uses a cylindrical field, restricted by concentric cylindrical electrodes and two flat electrodes perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. The inner electrode is usually connected with the flat electrodes, and the outer one, which is electrically isolated, has an electric potential that can either be constant or variable. (Potential is negative (-) for an electron beam, and positive (+) for a positive-ion beam.) The focusing field becomes very different from that of the simple-cylinder type (such as in the well-known CMA) near the flat-face boundaries; namely, it can achieve a very high energy resolution for a beam entering through the entrance window in one of the face electrodes. This new class of analyzer can be used in a variety of applications. It do remote sensing such as measuring the flow of charged particles in space; e.g., scanning-electron/Auger-electron spectroscopy for analyzing large objects. ESAs are usually designed and analyzed using an off-the-shelf ion-optics simulation-software package, such as SimIon, which includes the capability of performing Monte Carlo simulations on known test particles, thus providing the designer a better understanding of the response characteristics of the analyzer itself.

Geller recently directed his own independent feature titled Mother's Little Helpers. Career Geller grew up in Hollywood during the 1940s and 1950s. His father, a musician and arranger for CBS, was subpoenaed by the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the '50s, forcing the family to move to Paris, France. Educated at Dartmouth College and Yale University, Geller moved to Rome, Italy from 1969 to 79 to work for the Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis, where he wrote the screenplay for The Valachi Papers and other films. Rome became his home for the next 16 years. He worked in the Italian, French, British and independent film industries. He also commuted to Los Angeles and wrote for every major studio during this period. In 1986, he returned to Hollywood, working there for a time, but leaving to found screenwriting programs at Arizona State University and at Boston University. His screenwriting credits, in addition to Slaughterhouse- Five, include Ashanti, The Valachi Papers, and Warburg: A Man of Influence, and \\"Mother's Little Helpers.\\" In 1997, Geller directed, co-wrote and acted in the play Opportunities in Zero Gravity with Kae Geller, his writing partner and wife. This two-actor, seven-character play thematically wove monologues around popular cultural mythology, capitalism, and the pursuit of the American Dream. Aside from screenwriting, he has published 11 novels and a book on screenwriting, written several plays, and directed both theater and film.

A weakness of this conceptual and operational model is the absence of an explicit recognition of the place of life history traits. Evolutionary physiology is the study of the biological evolution of physiological structures and processes; that is, the manner in which the functional characteristics of individuals in a population of organisms have responded to natural selection across multiple generations during the history of the population. It is a sub-discipline of both physiology and evolutionary biology. Practitioners in the field come from a variety of backgrounds, including physiology, evolutionary biology, ecology, and genetics. Accordingly, the range of phenotypes studied by evolutionary physiologists is broad, including life history, behavior, whole-organism performance, functional morphology, biomechanics, anatomy, classical physiology, endocrinology, biochemistry, and molecular evolution. The field is closely related to comparative physiology and environmental physiology, and its findings are a major concern of evolutionary medicine. One definition that has been offered is \\"the study of the physiological basis of fitness, namely, correlated evolution (including constraints and trade-offs) of physiological form and function associated with the environment, diet, homeostasis, energy management, longevity, and mortality and life history characteristics\\". History As the name implies, evolutionary physiology is the product of what were at one time two distinct scientific disciplines. According to Garland and Carter, evolutionary physiology arose in the late 1970s, following debates concerning the metabolic and thermoregulatory status of dinosaurs (see physiology of dinosaurs) and mammal-like reptiles. This period was followed by attempts in the early 1980s to integrate quantitative genetics into evolutionary biology, which had spillover effects on other fields, such as behavioral ecology and ecophysiology. In the mid- to late 1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods started to become popular in many fields, including physiological ecology and comparative physiology. A 1987 volume titled New Directions in Ecological Physiology had little ecology but a considerable emphasis on evolutionary topics. It generated vigorous debate, and within a few years the National Science Foundation had developed a panel titled Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology. Shortly thereafter, selection experiments and experimental evolution became increasingly common in evolutionary physiology. Macrophysiology has emerged as a sub-discipline, in which practitioners attempt to identify large-scale patterns in physiological traits (e.g. patterns of co-variation with latitude) and their ecological implications. More recently, the importance of a merger of evolutionary biology and physiology has been argued from the perspective of functional analyses, epigenetics, and an extended evolutionary synthesis. The growth of evolutionary physiology is also reflected in the emergence of sub-disciplines, such as evolutionary endocrinology, which addresses such hybrid questions as \\"What are the most common endocrine mechanisms that respond to selection on behavior or life-history traits?\\" Emergent properties As a hybrid scientific discipline, evolutionary physiology provides some unique perspectives. For example, an understanding of physiological mechanisms can help in determining whether a particular pattern of phenotypic variation or co-variation (such as an allometric relationship) represents what could possibly exist or just what selection has allowed. Similarly, a thorough knowledge of physiological mechanisms can greatly enhance understanding of possible reasons for evolutionary correlations and constraints than is possible for many of the traits typically studied by evolutionary biologists (such as morphology). Areas of research Important areas of current research include: * Organismal performance as a central phenotype (e.g., measures of speed or stamina in animal locomotion) * Role of behavior in physiological evolution * Physiological and endocrinological basis of variation in life history traits (e.g., clutch size) * Functional significance of molecular evolution * Extent to which species differences are adaptive * Physiological underpinnings of limits to geographic ranges * Geographic variation in physiology * Role of sexual selection in shaping physiological evolution * Magnitude of \\"phylogenetic signal\\" in physiological traits * Role of pathogens and parasites in physiological evolution and immunity * Application of optimality modeling to elucidate the degree of adaptation * Role of phenotypic plasticity in accounting for individual, population, and species differences * Mechanistic basis of trade-offs and constraints on evolution (e.g., putative Carrier's constraint on running and breathing) * Limits on sustained metabolic rate * Origin of allometric scaling relations or allometric laws (and the so-called metabolic theory of ecology) * Individual variation (see also Individual differences psychology) * Functional significance of biochemical polymorphisms * Analysis of physiological variation via quantitative genetics * Paleophysiology and the evolution of endothermy * Human adaptational physiology * Darwinian medicine * Evolution of dietary antioxidants Techniques * Artificial selection and experimental evolution mouse wheel running video * Genetic analyses and manipulations * Measurement of selection in the wild * Phenotypic plasticity and manipulation * Phylogenetically based comparisons * Doubly labeled water measurements of free-living energy demands of animals Funding and societies In the United States, research in evolutionary physiology is funded mainly by the National Science Foundation.

It was published in the 1918 book Per Amica Silentia Lunae, where it introduced some of Yeats's essays, and collected with other poems in The Wild Swans at Coole (1919). The title is taken from Dante's La Vita Nuova: the words \\"ego dominus tuus\\" are spoken to Dante in a dream by the personification of Love. The two characters of the poem, Hic and Ille, are Latin words meaning this man and that man, respectively. Ezra Pound identified Ille with 'Willie', or Yeats: the poem covers many characteristic themes of Yeats, in particular the image of the mask and the concept of the double or \\"anti-self\\". The dialogue of Hic and Ille treats the poetry of Dante, John Keats, and Yeats himself, contrasting the words of each poet with the experience of their lives.

Fabbrica Torinese Velivoli Chiribiri & C., (Chiribiri Aircraft of Turin), was founded by the Venetian Antonio Chiribiri, Maurizio Ramassotto and the engineer Gaudenzio Verga. History Antonio Chiribiri and a Miller aero- engine Antonio 'Papa' Chiribiri was born in Venice in 1865 but it was not a natural city for engineering so he moved to Florence to work in a small factory. He quickly moved on to Zust and then Isotta Fraschini as a technical specialist in automobiles. In 1909, he joined the aeronautical manufacturer Miller Aircraft in Turin and took charge of technical design. Aircraft In 1910, Antonio Chiribiri started his own company manufacturing spare parts and accessories for aeronautics, 'Fabrica Torinese Velivoli Chiribiri & C'. The company became known for the quality of its aircraft parts and grew to build at least one aircraft, the 'Chiribiri No. 5', 2 seater, tractor monoplane which flew in July 1912. It was 24 feet (7.3 m) long with a 31 foot (9.4 m)wingspan, weighed 770 lb (350 kg) and flew at 55 mph (90 km/h). But then Chiribiri was licensed to build 100 aeronautical motors for French engine manufacturer Gnome et Rhone, so aircraft production ceased. This success enabled Chiribiri to open a ‚Äòflying school‚Äô at the factory, training pilots who subsequently flew in World War I. Chiribiri-engined Fiat speed record car In 1918, a Fiat Chiribiri broke the world speed record for the timed kilometre from a flying start. The car had been built in 1913, and had a 8,000 cc inline-four Chiribiri aircraft engine producing installed into a Fiat 50-60 HP chassis. It is usually considered the first monoposto made in Italy. At Monza it reached in the standing kilometer. It is currently displayed in the Mario Righini collection at the castle in Panzano, a frazione of Castelfranco Emilia, Italy.Index.htm at www.righinimario.it Cars Chiribiri four-seater, 1926 After their 1913 involvement with the land speed racer, Chiribiri started building production automobiles in earnest in 1914. Gustavo Brunetta d'Usseaux, a rich land owner, commissioned the construction of 100 examples of the ‚ÄòSiva‚Äô, a 980 cc economy car, but the financial side failed so Chiribri carried on alone. In 1915 they started a second production series with a larger chassis and 1300 cc, 12 hp (9 kW) engine, and continued throughout the war. At the 1919 Paris Motor Show Chiribiri launched the 12 HP light car. This was an open-bodied four-seater with a 1593 cc, side-valve, , and an embryonic transaxle layout with the four-speed transmission mounted with the rear differential. It was rather successful, remaining in production until 1922. It was replaced by the 100 km/h ‚ÄòRoma 5000‚Äô (Touring and Sport versions) with a 1499 cc engine producing at 3,200 rpm. This was in turn developed into the 1924 Milano, with a 1486 cc engine. A twin-cam version of this was sold as the Monza, either as a four-seater torpedo bodied tourer or as a 'Monza Corsa' for competition, eventually also available with a supercharger. The Monza was discontinued in 1927 while the Milano continued to be built until Chiribiri's demise. =Motor Racing= The racing debut of the Monza GT model in the hands of Ada Chiribiri, Amadeo Chiribiri, Tazio Nuvolari, Gigi Plat√© and I'inglese Scalese 'the Englishman' Jack Scales (Jan 29 1886-Oct 23 1962)The Nostalgia Forum at Atlas F1 brought three victories in the Susa-Moncenisio race, the Aosta-Gran San Bernardo race and the Voiturette GP at the Monza autodrome. In 1921 Amadeo Chiribiri, racing under the pseudonym of Deo, won the 'Coppa della Cascine' in Florence and Mauro Ramassotto came second in the 2,000 cc class of the Rome Criterium. Mario Tuccimei with Chiribiri \\"Roma 5000\\" at Targa Florio 1922 In the 1922 2nd Grand Prix of Penya Rhin (Barcelona) at the Circuit de Vilafranca, a road circuit in the hills behind Sitges, Mauro Ramassotto finished 3rd and Amadeo Chiribiri set the fastest lap (112 km/h) for 'Voiturettes' up to 2000 cc. In the 1923 3rd Grand Prix of Penya Rhin (Barcelona) at the Circuit de Vilafranca Tazio Nuvolari was 5th in the 1500 cc Chiribiri, and in the II Spanish Grand Prix at the banked Autodrom Sitges- Terramar, he finished 4th. In 1924, Alete Marconcini was Italian National Champion driving a Chiribiri 12/16 to 3 victories in the Circuito di Belfiore, the Circuito di Cremona and the Circuito del Montenero. Additionally Tazio Nuvolari won the Circuito del Savio and the Circuito del Polesine, whilst Rodolfo Caruso won the Coppa della Perugina. In 1926 Piroli, the riding mechanic, was killed at the Avus in Berlin on 9 July.Motorsport Memorial - Car and truck fatalities by vehicle brand at www.motorsportmemorial.org =Road cars= In 1923 a road version was released with either a 45 CV (33 kW) engine or a new 65 CV (48 kW) version using 5,000 rpm. 2 years later a supercharger was added, delivering 95 CV (70 kW) at 5,700 rpm, and achieving . In 1927, the company diversified into diesel and industrial engines. Demise In 1925, the company was revamped and the name was changed to 'Auto Costruzioni Meccaniche Chiribiri' but sales of road going vehicles were never high, due in large part to the poor performance of the side-valve Milano whilst its higher 'aeronautical' engineering quality standards necessitated higher pricing. So, despite the 1927 venture into diesel and industrial engines, when financial depression hit Europe the company closed on 3 September 1929, its assets being sold to Lancia. Family Antonio Chiribiri died in April 1943. Amedeo, his son born in 1898, and Ada his daughter, had been his closest collaborators and team members, having won races, hill climbs and rallies.

Pangalay (also known as Daling-Daling or Mengalai in Sabah) is the traditional \\"fingernail\\" dance of the Taus≈´g people of the Sulu Archipelago and eastern coast Bajau of Sabah. The dance has a similarity to classical Balinese and Thai dances, where it is also the most distinctively Asian of all the southern Philippine dances because dancers must have dexterity and flexibility of the shoulders, elbows, and wrists ‚Äì movements that strongly resemble those of \\"kontaw silat\\". The Malaysian art of Buah Pukul is classified as silat despite its Yunnan origin, kuntao is \\"way of the fist\\", from kun Êã≥ meaning fist and tao ÈÅì meaning way. This term was originally used for Chinese martial arts in general. The Pangalay is predominantly performed during weddings or other festive events. The male equivalent of the Pangalay is the Pangasik and features more martial movements, while a pangalay that features both a male and female dancer is called Pangiluk. The original concept of the Pangalay is based on the pre-Islamic and Buddhist concept of male and female celestial angels (Sanskrit: Vidhyadhari, Tausug: Biddadari) common as characters in other Southeast Asian dances. Neighbouring Samal and Bajau peoples in the Philippines call this type of dance, Umaral or Igal, and they sometimes use bamboo castanets as substitutes for long fingernails. Pakiring A variant of the dance called Pakiring is practiced by the people of Mindanao, Sulu and Sabah. The dance emphasizes the movement of the hips (kiring-kiring), to mimic the movement of a butterfy. It is also called kendeng-kendeng in Tagalog speakers of Central Luzon. Throughout the Philippines, a traditional song called Kiriring Pakiriring often accompanied this dance. The lyrics of the song is in the Sama language and are thought to have originated from Simunul, where the language is often spoken. The song became popular nationwide when it was re-recorded in the 90s under the title, Dayang Dayang; however some of lyrics have been changed and considered mainly to be largely gibberish since the altered words has no meaning behind them and were not related to any dialect or adage. The meaning of its name is lived to be referring to Hadji Dayang Dayang Piandao, the first lady of Sulu, since the word dalay-dalay was a title given only to the stepdaughters of the Sultan. Today, this version is widely known across the Philippines rather than the original but its origin and the artist who originally recorded it remains a mystery.

Like the Erteb√∏lle culture, the settlements were concentrated near water, in this case creeks, riverdunes and bogs along post-glacial banks of rivers like the Overijsselse Vecht. In the 1960s and 1970s, artifacts classified as \\"Swifterbant culture\\" were found in the (now dry) Flevopolder in the Netherlands, near the villages of Swifterbant and Dronten. Other well-known sites were uncovered in Zuid Holland (Bergschenhoek) and the Betuwe (Hardinxveld-Giessendam). The oldest finds related to this culture, dated to circa 5600 BC, cannot be distinguished from the Erteb√∏lle culture,L. P. Louwe Kooijmans - Trijntje van de Betuweroute, Jachtkampen uit de Steentijd te Hardinxveld-Giessendam, 1998, Spiegel Historiael 33, blz. 423-428, normally associated with Northern Germany and Southern Scandinavia. The culture is ancestral to the Western group of the agricultural Funnelbeaker culture (4000-2700 BC), which extended through Northern Netherlands and Northern Germany to the Elbe.Trechterbekercultuur, in Encyclopedie Drenthe Online The earliest dated sites are season settlements. A transition from hunter-gatherer culture to cattle farming, primarily cows and pigs, occurred around 4800-4500 BC. Pottery has been attested from this period. In the region indications to the existence of pottery are present from before the arrival of the Linear Pottery culture in the neighbourhood.L√ºning, et al., 1989; L√ºning, 2000 The material culture reflects a local evolution from Mesolithic communities, with a pottery in a Nordic (Erteb√∏lle) style and trade relationships with southern late R√∂ssen culture communities, as testified by the presence of true Breitkeile pottery sherds.Archaeology and Coastal Change in the Netherlands - Dr L. P. Louwe Kooijmans, 1980 The R√∂ssen culture, being an offshoot of Linear Pottery, is older than the finds in Swifterbant, and contemporary to older stages of this culture as found in Hoge Vaart (Almere) and Hardinxveld. Contact between Swifterbant and R√∂ssen expressed itself by some hybrid early Swifterbant pots in Anvers (Doel) and hybrid R√∂ssen pottery Hamburg-Boberg. In general, Swifterbant pottery does not show the same variety as R√∂ssen pottery and Swifterbant pottery with R√∂ssen influences are rare. Possibly the idea of cooking could be derived from agricultural neighbours. However, the technical style for making pottery are too different to consider such external influences.Swifterbant-aardewerk : een analyse van de neolithische nederzettingen bij Swifterbant, 5e millennium voor Christus, J.P. de Roever. Groningen, 2004 Wetland settlement, unlike previous opinions, was a deliberate choice by prehistoric communities, as this offered attractive ecological conditions and a high natural productivity or agricultural potential.Wetland Exploitation and Upland,Relations of Prehistoric Communities in the Netherlands - L. P. Louwe Kooijmans The economy covered a broad spectrum of resources to gather food, ruled by a strategy to diversify rather than increasing volume. As such, the wetlands offered, next to hunting and fishing, optimized conditions for cattle and small scale cultivation of different crops, each having conditions for growing of their own.De spiegel van Swifterbant - Daan Raemakers, 2006, University of Groningen The agrarian transformation of the prehistoric community was an exclusively indigenous process, that ultimately realized itself only at the end of the Neolithic. This view has been supported by the discovery of an agricultural field in Swifterbant dated 4300-4000 BC.Prehistoric agricultural field found in Swifterbant, 4300-4000 BC Animal sacrifices found in the bogs of Drenthe are attributed to Swifterbant and suggest a religious role for both wild and domesticated bovines.

Wildes served on the Civil Rights Committee which utilized the precepts of the U.S Declaration of Independence, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, the Soviet Constitution of 1918, and the Weimar Constitution of 1919 to create a strong Bill of Rights for the Japanese Constitution.

The frequency of this disease is therefore 1 in approximately 3.75 billion (although since the disease manifested in identical twins, the actual frequency is 1 in approximately 7.5 billion). It is named after Welsh twins Catherine and Kirstie Fields, of Llanelli. Fields' disease is a neuromuscular disease, causing muscular degeneration. The disease was first noticed when the twins were four. Doctors have been unable to identify it and have not been able to match it to any known diseases. As a result, the Fields sisters have undergone numerous tests, but no treatment has yet been found. No definitive cause has been determined, and doctors have generally concluded that they were born with it. __TOC__ Prognosis The disease appears to be progressive in nature. The Fields twins started having problems when they were four years old. By the time they had reached the age of nine, they were having difficulty walking and needed frames to assist them with walking. Their muscles have been gradually deteriorating over time. The disease affects the twins' nerves, causing them to make involuntary muscle movements such as trembling in the hands. The extent of the disease is still unknown as the two women are only 26. However, the disease has had no apparent effect on their brains or personalities. Doctors do not know if the disease is fatal and, if so, what the life expectancy of one with this disease is. If the cause of the disease is genetic, there is a chance that the twins could pass it on to their future children. History =The twins' lives= The twins require the use of wheelchairs for mobility and are unable to speak without the assistance of electronic speaking aids.Daily Mirror, 12 September 2012 They experience persistent and painful muscle spasms which are worsened by emotional distress. They are currently living with their parents, with the assistance of hospice workers. Doctors continue to administer tests to the twins in search of a treatment.

Battle, director of the Executive Office for US Attorneys, called Lam and notified her that she must resign no later than January 31, 2007. Battle instructed Lam to explain that she had decided to pursue other opportunities. Following that phone call, Lam called Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty to find out why she was being asked to resign. McNulty said he wanted to take some time to respond since he didn't want to give an answer \\"that would lead\\" Lam down the wrong path. McNulty added that he knew Lam had been through a long trial (presumably the Alvarado Hospital case) and had great respect for her. In a follow-up call with Battle, Lam requested additional time to ensure an orderly transition from office. On January 5, 2007, Battle said her request was \\"not being received positively\\" and that Lam \\"should stop thinking in terms of the cases in the office\\". Battle insisted that Lam had to depart in weeks, not months, and these orders were \\"coming from the very highest levels of government\\". Lam submitted her resignation January 16, 2007, effective February 15. Many prominent Democrats, including Senators Charles Schumer and Dianne Feinstein, allege that Lam's firing was part of a broader, vengeful move against prosecutors that have pursued political corruption cases that damaged the careers of Republican politicians, or that were not loyal enough to either the Republican Party or the Administration. Republican Congressman Darrell Issa has stated that he takes \\"maybe one-twentieth\\" of the responsibility for Lam's firing. Statistics compiled by Lam's office corroborate the assertion that total prosecutions in border crossing cases have declined over Lam's tenure. However, the Justice Department itself defended Lam in an August 23, 2006, letter to Senator Feinstein. They asserted: > The immigration philosophy of the Southern District focuses on deterrence by > directing its resources and efforts against the worst immigration offenders > and by bringing felony cases against such defendants that will result in > longer sentences. For example, although the number of defendants who > received prison sentences between 1‚Äì12 months fell from 896 in 2004 to 338 > in 2005, the number of immigration defendants who received sentences longer > than 60 months rose from 21 to 77. Prosecutions for alien smuggling in the > Southern District under U.S.C. sec. 1324 are rising sharply in Fiscal Year > 2006. In her own defense, Lam echoed the Justice Department's August letter, emphasizing quality prosecutions over sheer quantity. \\"When you take on more difficult investigations, the number of prosecutions might not be as high, but you have a larger impact on crime in the community.\\" During her tenure as U.S. Attorney, Lam received both the Director's Award for Superior Performance and the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service. United States Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a Republican member of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, stated on his April 1, 2007, appearance on NBC's Meet the Press broadcast: Senator Hatch's description of Lam, however, was inaccurate; Lam was never a campaign manager for any candidate, nor a law professor, and she is an experienced prosecutor. After a week of controversy, Hatch wrote a letter to Tim Russert claiming that he \\"mispoke\\" in naming Lam several times, intending instead to name Alan Bersin, Lam's predecessor; however, Bersin likewise had never been a law professor and was an experienced trial lawyer.  Later career  When she left the U.S. Attorney's position in February 2007, she accepted the position of senior vice president and legal counsel for Qualcomm. She was named Attorney of the Year by the San Diego County Bar Association in February 2007. Los Angeles Daily Journal named to the list of \\"Top 75 Women Litigators\\". Lam has been frequently mentioned as a potential nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States by observers of Barack Obama's administration.  Personal  Lam is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sau-Wing Lam of Tenafly, New Jersey. She married Mark Steven Burnett, a geophysicist specializing in oceanography, on August 23, 1986.

In 1664 and 1665 he travelled in company with Sir Christopher Wren and Edward Browne. In 1666, Trumbull returned to college and in 1667 he was awarded a Doctorate of Civil Law. Professional life He was admitted an advocate in Doctors' Commons in London on 28 April 1668 and began practising in the ecclesiastical and admiralty courts. He would remain for the next 15 years, becoming a lawyer of high repute. Through the offices of his father-in- law, Sir Charles Cotterell, he was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Rochester in 1671 by its bishop, John Dolben, the future archbishop of York, and benefited much from 'the friendship and patronage of that great and good man'. In 1683 he was appointed Judge Advocate of the Fleet by Lord Dartmouth, George Legge, in an expedition to evacuate the British colony at Tangier, where he was to act as commissioner for settling the leases of the houses between the King and the inhabitants. Samuel Pepys, who was also on the expedition, was unimpressed ‚Äì \\"Strange to see how surprised and troubled Dr. Trumbull shows himself at this new work put on him of a judge-advocate; how he cons over the law-martial and what weak questions he asks me about it.\\" Later Pepys calls him \\"a man of the meanest mind as to courage that ever was born.\\" In 1684, Charles II considered Trumbull as a possible Secretary of State, but he was eventually offered the office of Secretary of War in Ireland, which he turned down. Nevertheless, he was knighted on 21 November 1684, and on 1 February 1685 was made Clerk of the Deliveries of the Ordnance. Through the favour of the Trelawny family, he entered Parliament as MP for the Cornish borough of East Looe 1685‚Äì1687. Charles II died a few days later and Trumbull had to relinquish the clerkship when he was sent by James II, against his own wishes, as envoy extraordinary to France. With King James a declared papist and French King Louis XIV persecuting his Protestant subjects, Trumbull, a devout Anglican, was an odd choice for the post, being a zealous opponent of Roman Catholicism, and did much to benefit the condition of the English Protestants in France after Edict of Fontainebleau. In 1686 he was recalled from Paris, and on 15 October was nominated by the king to be appointed Ambassador at Constantinople, where he arrived on 17 August 1687. He remained ambassador until 31 July 1691 when he departed Turkey. Sir William was a Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company from 1696 to 1700 and the Turkey Company from 1696 to 1709. On 3 May 1694 he was appointed a Commissioner of the Treasury, and a year later was made a Privy Counsellor and appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department. However, he was unhappy in the post, and resigned it on 2 December 1697. He then retired from public life. Trumbull was a friend of both John Dryden and Alexander Pope. Dryden records, in the postscript to his translation of Virgil, that \\"if the last Aeneid shine amongst its fellows, it is owing to the commands of Sir William Trumbull, who recommended it as his favourite to my care.\\" It was Trumbull who, admiring Pope's translation of the \\"Epistle of Sarpedon\\" from the Iliad urged him to translate the whole of Homer's works, and Pope's \\"Spring\\" was dedicated to him. Family life In 1670, Trumbull married Katherine, daughter of Sir Charles Cotterell, Master of the Ceremonies; she died in 1704, they having had no children. In Scotland in October 1706, he married Judith (died 1724), daughter of Henry Alexander, the 4th Earl of Stirling. They had two children, Judith (1707‚Äì1708) and William (1708‚Äì1760). Trumbull died on 14 December 1716. He was buried on 21 December at Easthampstead church. His funerary monument in the south transept proclaims that 'he maintained the character of an able statesman'. His son William had an only daughter, who became the wife of the Hon. Martin Sandys, second son of Samuel Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys. She was thus the ancestress of the later marquesses of Downshire. Letters Many of Trumbull's letters are in the British Library and in the Record Office, London. Trumbull was on friendly terms with Pierre Bayle and was a mentor to the young Henry St. John, later Viscount Bolingbroke, who may have met his great friend, Pope, through Trumbull.

Retrieved: 3 March 2014. In 1985 there were 130 girls, aged between 11 and 18 years, and 26 teachers at the school. The school eventually closed in July 1990.  Wardour facilities  At New Wardour Castle (not to be confused with Wardour Castle) there were dormitories for girls in the 1st to 4th Forms around the top fourth floor of the building, each with beds for between two and six girls. Fifth Formers slept on the mezzanine floor below this. The Lower Sixth Form had studios for one or two girls in a modern extension on the south-eastern side of the building. Upper Sixth formers all had their own individual rooms in the upper East Wing flat or in a separate building known as 'The Hexagon' ( The Hexagon was used as accommodation for staff in the late-1970s). Pupils ate in the modern dining hall built on the south-eastern side of the building, next to the gymnasium. This extension had additional modern classrooms for Art and Science. All other classrooms were in the main building on the ground and first floors. A student assembly was held most mornings around the rotunda staircase, with each year standing in groups between the columns. This usually included a short religious ceremony and singing accompaniment on the rotunda organ. Other facilities included a school chapel and student laundry rooms. Each year had its own common room to relax in, when not in class. Outside, there was an open-air swimming pool in the walled garden, six tennis courts and a running track, with space for field sports on the front lawn. There was also an enclosure for outdoor pets, which students were encouraged to keep. In addition to the Hexagon building, there were three houses for staff and their families. These were built in the 1970s and were referred to as Melbury, LongAsh (Long Ash was used for 6th form students in the late-1970s) a grea and Burwood. Other staff lived in flats within the main building or else commuted from the surrounding area. Other outdoor features included a bicycle shed, a water well, a temple folly, a Camellia house, and a sewage treatment works and an ice house.

The arrival of the Spanish colonists introduced chattel slavery and involuntary servitude to the area. White colonists from the Southern and Eastern United States brought their systems of organized slavery to California. Many free and enslaved people of African ancestry were part of the California Gold Rush (1848‚Äì55), and many were able to buy their freedom and freedom for their families, primarily in the South, with the gold they found.Jason B. Johnson, \\"Slavery in Gold Rush Days -- New Discoveries Prompt Exhibition, Re-examination of State's Involvement,\\" SFGate, January 27, 2007. There were a number of Gold Rushers of African ancestry, probably fewer than 4,000.Another estimate is 2,500 forty-niners of African ancestry. Rawls, James, J. and Orsi, Richard (eds.) (1999), p. 5. One of the miners was an African American slave named Edmond Edward Wysinger (1816‚Äì1891). After arriving in the Northern mine area of the California Mother Lode with his owner in 1849, Wysinger and a group of 100 or more African American miners were surface mining in and around Morman, Mokelumne Hill at Placerville, and Grass Valley.Delilah L. Beasley, The Negro Trail Blazers of California, 1919, pp. 105 & 183 (Has been reprinted in 1997 and 2004). It took him about a year to buy his freedom for $1,000.  Spanish era  The Spanish first began to settle in California in 1769, founding the first Spanish mission, Misi√≥n San Diego de Alcal√°. They also established four military installations throughout California, el Presidio Real de San Carlos de Monterey, el Presidio Real de San Diego, el Presidio Real de San Francisco, and el Presidio Real de Santa B√°rbara. The padres would often baptize Native Californian villages en masse and relocate them to the missions, where they would work either voluntarily or by force from location to location. Native Californians became cobblers, carpenters, masons, planters, harvesters, and cattle slaughterers. To the padres, the Native Californians were newly baptized members of the Catholic Church and were treated with varying amounts of respect, depending on the priest in question. Many of the soldiers, however, saw them solely as manpower to be exploited. The soldiers would force the Native Californians to perform most of the manual labor needed in their fortresses, and often raped the women of their villages. There was multiple recorded uprising by the Native Californians, both violent and nonviolent. There were several recorded uprisings of Indians resisting Spanish rule, one of the earliest being the attack on the Mission San Diego de Alcala on November 4, 1775. The Tipai-Ipai organized nine villages into a force of around 800 people to destroy the mission and kill three of the Spanish, one of them being Padre Luis Jayme. However, not every uprising was violent. In September 1795, over two hundred natives, including many old neophytes, simply deserted San Francisco all in different directions. When uprisings occurred, the natives did not go unpunished: some Indians were put to death. The padres treated Indians and Native Americans as slaves. The Spanish also imported Filipino slaves to Central California in the early 19th century.  Mexican era  Most of the future western United States, roughly south of 42 degrees North latitude and from California eastward to Texas, the Oklahoma Panhandle and southwestern Kansas, was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and, thus, became part of Mexico upon independence from Spain in 1821. President Vicente Guerrero, who was of Spanish, African and Native American descent, abolished slavery within Mexico in 1829. This law was intended by its proponents as a counter-measure against settlement by Americans, who used slave labor in their Texas cotton plantations. But this did not stop Americans from moving into the Mexican province of \\"Tejas.\\" Instead, by 1832, American settlement in Texas reached sufficient critical mass to declare and win independence from Mexico as the Republic of Texas. The annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845 precipitated the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, which resulted in California becoming American territory. Slavery under U.S. rule With the 1848 defeat of Mexico, California and other Mexican territories were ceded to U.S. rule (the Mexican Cession) under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war. However, at the time, the 30-state nation was divided equally between 15 free states and 15 slave states. With the addition of vast new, agriculturally-rich territories, including California, the debate over slavery intensified dramatically. California itself was divided over the issue, as a large number of slave-owning Southerners had travelled to California to seek their fortunes in the 1849 Gold Rush, and many brought their slaves. Many miners expressed concern that slaveholders accompanied by slaves had an unfair advantage in the mining camps and that slavery's inherent inequality violated \\"the independent entrepreneurial sprit of the mines.\\"Janet Neary and Hollis Robbins, \\"African American Literature of the Gold Rush,\\" Mapping Region in Early American Writing. Eds. Edward Watts, Keri Holt, and John Funchion. Athens: University of Georgia Press (2015), p. 232 However, taking slaves into California, which had no laws or enforcement mechanisms for maintaining the institution, turned out to be quite risky for the slave owners themselves. The territory had no slave patrols, nor local police interested in maintaining slavery, so slave escapes were quite common.https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/applied-and-social-sciences- magazines/slavery-far-west-ca-co-nm-nv-or-ut-wa In October 1849, the first California Constitution Convention was held. One of the most heated debates of the Convention was on the status of slavery in the new state.California Constitutional Convention 1849 While some Southerners who had come to California were staunchly in favor of giving official sanction to slavery in California, Northern abolitionists and White-American miners (who did not want competition from the slave-holders in the gold fields) were well represented within the ranks of the convention. The chairman of the convention, William Gwin, was himself a slaveholder from Tennessee. Gwin, however, was much more interested in gaining control of the California Democratic Party than he was in favoring either side of the debate. To the later chagrin of his fellow Southern members of Congress, he did not write the institution of slavery into the 1849 Constitution. The Compromise of 1850 later permitted California to be admitted to the Union as a free state. Gwin and war hero/abolitionist John C. Fr√©mont became California's first Senators. Although California entered the Union as a free state, the framers of the state constitution wrote into law the systematic denial of suffrage and other civil rights to non-white citizens. Some authorities went so far as to attempt to deny entry of all African-Americans, free and slave, to California. The Legislature passed a bill that would ban the immigration of free blacks to California. State Senator David C. Broderick, a fierce opponent of slavery and former firefighter from San Francisco, managed to kill the bill through parliamentary maneuver. Slavery did persist in California even without legal authority. Some slaveowners simply refused to notify their slaves of the prohibition, and continued to trade slaves within the state. Numerous state trials ruled in the favor of emancipation. *In 1849, a white man lost a case against a black man who was accused of both being a slave and being in debt to the accuser. At the time, California was not under U.S. rule, and Mexican law, which prohibited slavery, was used in the case. This resulted in the legal precedent of the official non-acknowledgement of slavery in California. *In 1851, a fugitive slave named Frank was recaptured by his owner in San Francisco; Frank then sued the owner in court. The judge ruled in favor of Frank because the slave had taken his freedom in California and didn't cross state lines in the process, thus ruling the application of the Fugitive Slave Law, which was passed in Congress the previous year, invalid in this case. Furthermore, a California law passed in 1850 had ruled the testimony of non-whites in court inadmissible; hence, even though Frank had admitted to being the owner's slave, the case had proceeded in his favor because his own admission was invalid. *In 1852, a state fugitive slave law was passed in Sacramento, and was unsuccessfully challenged in the Perkins escapee case. However, when the law lapsed in 1855, the Legislature failed to renew it, and the Mitchell case in San Jose resulted in freedom for Mitchell, a runaway slave. *In 1856, Benjamin Ignatius Hayes freed 14 slaves, including Biddy Mason, who had been held in slavery in a Mormon settlement in San Bernardino for five years, saying the slaves had been kept ignorant of the laws and their rights. *In 1858, in one of the most protracted cases over the state-level status of slavery, Archy Lee, a slave who had run away from his owner, Mississippi native Terry Stovall, was arrested four times as his fate - as a slave bound for return to Mississippi with his master, or continued residence in California as a free man - was decided in a flip-flop manner by some three local judges and a United States Commissioner. Archy won the case through the support of the local freed black community in San Francisco. To avoid further legal reprisals by his former owner, he fled to Canada, where he eventually died.Archy Lee's historical documents A backlash against these legal wins for the free black community in California whipped up in the State government; the Chinese Exclusion Act was also being debated at that time. Fearful of the hostile maneuvers against them, over 700 African-Americans left California in a mass exodus via steam ship for the women and children and mass cavalcade for the men to Victoria, Canada, and the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. Slavery was abolished in all states under the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which took effect on 18 December 1865.  Slavery of indigenous peoples  The Spanish first began to settle in California in 1769, founding the first Spanish mission, Misi√≥n San Diego de Alcal√°. They also established four military installations throughout California, el Presidio Real de San Carlos de Monterey, el Presidio Real de San Diego, el Presidio Real de San Francisco, and el Presidio Real de Santa B√°rbara. The padres would often baptize Native Californian villages en masse and relocate them to the missions, where they would work either voluntarily or by force from location to location.

The soldiers would force the Native Californians to perform most of the manual labor needed in their fortresses, and often raped the women of their villages. There was multiple recorded uprising by the Native Californians, both violent and nonviolent. Mexico gained its independence from Spain and from 1821‚Äì1846 California was under Mexican rule. The Mexican National Congress passed the Colonization Act of 1824 in which large sections of unoccupied land were granted to individuals and in 1833 the government secularized missions and consequently many civil authorities at the time confiscated the land from the missions for themselves. These two acts aided in the creation of a ranchos system that required a large labor force to maintain. Essentially the entire economy shifted from work on the missions to work on large land estates of wealthy Mexicans. A system was devised where it was virtually cost free to utilize indigenous labor; workers were exchanged between ranchos and essentially became indentured servants. In 1848 Mexico ceded California to the United States and 1845‚Äì1855 marked the years of the gold rush, bringing in white immigrants to California. Indians became the major and immediate source of labor for mining. In those 10 years the Indian population decreased by two-thirds and in order to craft California's own code of labor, An Act for the Government and Protection of Indians was passed in 1850 which \\"legally\\" curtailed the rights of Indians. Within this Act, Indian children could be obtained for indenture, convicted Indians could be hired out of jail and Indians could not testify for or against whites. 24,000 to 27,000 California Native Americans were took as forced laborers by settlers including 4,000 to 7,000 children; Between 1851 and 1852, three Indian commissioners negotiated treaties with the Indians and eventually eighteen were written, allocating 7.5% of the state as Indian reservations. The United States Senate rejected these treaties and about a year later in 1853, the government designed its own five reservations. These reservations had very poor living conditions and displaced many of the Indians from their native lands. This led many Indians to abandon reservations and resort to raiding California towns. Multiple massacres occurred during these years.

An individual will be presented with a set of directions such as: > Imagine that you are told that you have 10 years left to live. In connection > with this you are also told that you can choose to live these 10 years in > your current health state or that you can choose to give up some life years > to live for a shorter period in full health. Indicate with a cross on the > line the number of years in full health that you think is of equal value to > 10 years in your current health state. The answer given by the individual shows how many years in the current health state they would be willing to 'trade off', in order to regain full health. This answer can be used to calculate the individual's quality of life in that health state. For example, an individual with severe asthma could be offered 10 years in their current condition, or a shorter length of time in full health. If this individual is willing to trade off two of the ten offered years in order to regain full health, this suggests that eight years in full health has the same value as ten years with severe asthma. In this case, the individual would have valued living with severe asthma at 0.8, relative to full health (defined as 1.0). TTO scores can be influenced by socio- demographic characteristics and attitudinal variables of respondents, such as age, gender, marital status, having children, health status, education level, socio-economic status, ethnicity, and religious beliefs. Also, they can be influenced by the effects of ill health on consumptive activities and non- health-related utility. Time-trade-off results are often used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), allowing healthcare decisionmakers to combine mortality and morbidity into a single interval scale. Other tools that are used to determine quality of life are the visual analogue scale (VAS), the standard gamble method, the EQ-5D, the Health Utilities Index (HUI), etc. References Category:Health economics Category:Quality of life ","title":"Time-trade-off"},{"id":"9528223","text":"The Bristol and North Somerset Railway was a railway line in the West of England that connected Bristol with Radstock, through Pensford and further into northern Somerset, to allow access to the Somerset Coalfield. The line ran almost due south from Bristol and was long. Opened in 1873, it joined with an existing branch from Frome to Radstock, and was later worked with it as a single entity. In 1882 the Camerton Branch was opened by the Great Western Railway to serve collieries at Camerton; it was later extended to Limpley Stoke, on the Bath to Trowbridge line. It closed to passenger traffic in 1925. The line's primary traffic was coal, and travel to work commuting into Bristol. Both of these traffic sources substantially declined in the 1950s, with the Camerton Branch fully closed in 1951. Passenger traffic ceased on the rest of the entire line complex before the Beeching Axe in 1959, with complete closure of the line in 1973 following the closure of the last colliery in the Somerset Coalfield at Kilmersdon. History =Getting an Act for the line= The Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway (WS&WR;) was established in 1845 to build a network of lines, running from near Chippenham on the Great Western Railway (GWR) to Salisbury and Weymouth.Derek Phillips, The Story of the Westbury to Weymouth Line, Oxford Publishing Co., Sparkford, 1994, At that time Radstock was the most important mining centre of the Somerset Coalfield, and the WS&WR; included in its plans a branch from near Frome to Radstock. The WS&WR; found raising money for its ambitious network difficult, and the Company sold its lines, not all of which were complete, to the GWR on 14 March 1850, confirmed by an Act of Parliament on 3 July 1851. The GWR opened the Radstock branch to mineral traffic only on 14 November 1854, built to broad gauge.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, volume I 1833-1863, published by the Great Western Railway., London, 1927 As early as 1863 the Board of the GWR had resolved to create a standard gauge line from Bristol to Salisbury through the district,I.e. standard gauge; in the conflict between the GWR's traditional track gauge known as the broad gauge and standard gauge, the latter was often referred to as narrow gauge for contrast.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, volume II, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1932, page 66 and there were numerous independent schemes to serve the important colliery sites north of Radstock, and link them to the city of Bristol. These schemes came to nothing until in September 1862 when promoters formed an agreement to make a line from Bristol, with connections to other lines there, to a junction with the newly formed Somerset and Dorset Railway near Bruton,The Somerset and Dorset Railway was formed on 1 September 1862 by the amalgamation of the Somerset Central Railway and the Dorset Central Railway; it ran from Highbridge to Templecombe and Blandford to Wimborne, with plans to connect the two portions of line; the Bath extension was opened on 20 July 1874 and became the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway on 13 July 1876. See Atthill and Nock. running through the colliery areas of Pensford and Clutton, and with a branch to Camerton, where there were further collieries. It was to connect at Bristol with both broad gauge and narrow gauge lines, as well as having a tramway to the City Docks at the Floating Harbour. The proposal became a Parliamentary bill, and received the Royal Assent on 21 July 1863: it was to be called the Bristol and North Somerset Railway, with capital of ¬£275,000 and borrowing powers of ¬£91,000.Mike Vincent, Through Countryside & Coalfield, Oxford Publishing Co, Sparkford, Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 This appeared to serve the GWR objective admirably; the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth had a branch to Radstock, and the network also served Salisbury; if the gauge of their Radstock branch were mixed, the desired through route to Salisbury would be created via Radstock at minimum cost. However, when the Bristol and North Somerset Railway (B&NSR;) approached the GWR to explore the GWR's willingness to work the line, and to run passenger trains on their Frome - Radstock line, the GWR's reaction was cool. =A series of proposed extensions= Following this success in Parliament, the Company immediately set about proposing extensions as Bills for the 1864 session: from onward from the authorised Camerton branch to Bath; from the main line to Shepton Mallet, to join the East Somerset Railway there; and various branches in Bristol and at the docks there. Three Bills followed for the 1865 session: for a railway from Radstock passing Writhlington (where there was an important colliery) and through Wellow and Midford to Monkton Combe, on the Bradford on Avon to Bathampton line; for a line from Farrington Gurney to Shepton Mallet and the East Somerset line again; and from near Hallatrow to the Midland Railway Bath branch, joining it between Weston and Kelston, west of Bath, connecting with the GWR line in passing. In 1866 the GWR and the B&NSR; jointly submitted a bill for a line from Mells to through Nettlebridge, south of Radstock to Chilcompton. In 1869 the B&NSR; obtained an Act confirming its powers to build the harbour tramway at Bristol. None of these lines was built by the Company; only the line from a junction with the GWR immediately east of Bristol Temple Meads to Radstock was built.Vincent provides the only available source material for these Parliamentary efforts; presumably all these Bills were thrown out. Vincent says (page 45) that the GWR and B&NSR; together \\"deposited a joint act in 1866\\"; an Act can't be deposited; it is not clear whether he means they submitted a Bill in 1866 for the 1867 session of Parliament, or that they obtained the Act in 1866. The Somerset and Dorset Railway was independent at this time, and the B&NSR; made overtures to that company about an alliance or merger. This seemed to be a more fruitful way forward, and Parliamentary Bills were deposited to authorise the merger, and a physical connection at Shepton Mallet, but in May 1866 it emerged that the S&DR; had undertaken to route major traffic flows via the Bristol and Exeter Railway, with which it connected at Highbridge. This frustrated any advantage for the B&NSR; in merging, and its Bill was withdrawn. =Construction, and collapse= Having obtained its authorising Act, the Company appointed its engineer, James Frazer, and a contractor, Bethell and Walton. However Bethell and Walton asked for an advance of payment, but only got some shares in the Company. They had what is now called a cash-flow problem, and further requests for cash came from them, with little work output to show. On 9 April 1864 they were given a formal ultimatum by the Company Secretary, at which they declared that they would not continue with the work. A firm called Lawrence and Fry took over the works, while Bethell and Walton issued demands for payment for work done. The Company itself was desperately short of money as subscribers had failed to respond to calls, and land acquisition was proving unaffordable; then on 27 June 1864 it was announced that Lawrence and Fry had become bankrupt. Lawrence subsequently approached the Company in his private capacity, and a deal was struck enabling him to work as the Company's contractor. The Company's money shortage meant that little real progress seems to have taken place; perhaps the Company's management focus had been on Parliamentary work on extensions. In July 1866 the banking firm of Overend, Gurney and Company failed, and this triggered a financial crisis; many people lost large amounts of money, and obtaining share subscriptions for new construction became, for a time impossible. The Bristol and North Somerset Company found that raising finance was now impossible, and the Company \\"collapsed\\". At a shareholders' meeting on 4 May 1867, the Board disclosed that the Company was now in the hands of creditors. Moreover, of the authorised share capital of ¬£275,000, only ¬£16,080 of shares had been applied for and issued; more had been given free to unfortunate suppliers and contractors in payment. Individual Directors had given personal surety for Company borrowings in the amount of ¬£180,000; this was twice the authorised quantum. The liabilities were said to amount to ¬£300,000, and sums expended could not be made to equate to work actually completed. The Company Secretary John Bingham became embroiled in claims of improper dealings. The \\"collapse\\" of the Company was complete. =A new company= Many people had lost a lot of money, but the area still needed a railway line, and a new Bristol and North Somerset Railway was created, authorised by Act of 31 July 1868. The engineer was William Clarke and his first task was to assess what physical works had actually been made. As well as doing so, he proposed a simplification of the route at Radstock making a northerly sweep and avoiding housing in the town centre, and joining more directly into the GWR terminus. This required another authorising Act and it was obtained on 14 July 1870.Vincent describes this as the B&NSR; (Deviation at Radstock) Act of 30 November 1869, but that must be the date of deposition of the bill. On getting the Act, the Company sought offers from contractors and John Perry and Sons of Stratford quoted ¬£90,000 to complete the line, and was awarded contracts. The intention was to open at least between Bristol and Pensford by the following spring of 1871. Further problems were encountered with the quality and rate of progress of the construction, but at length the line was ready for the Board of Trade inspection. Col Rich visited the line on 2 September 1873. His report alluded to a great number of detail matters, but he approved the opening. =Opening at last= The opening of the line took place on 3 September 1873. It was built on the standard gauge, and it was worked by the Great Western Railway. The new B&NSR; line met the WS&WR; line at Radstock, but that was a broad gauge line, so there was a break of gauge at Radstock. The opening of the B&NSR; activated a neglected obligation on the GWR: in February 1874 the GWR Board recorded that: > By the terms of an Agreement with the Bristol and North Somerset Company and > the principal Colliery Proprietors of the Radstock District, this Company is > under engagement to lay the narrow gauge between Radstock and Salisbury on > or before 3rd September next ... In view of this obligation, the Directors > ... consider that the convenience of the public will be best met, and the > interest of the Proprietors best secured, by the alteration from Broad to > Narrow Gauge of all the Lines in the district which these railways > accommodate.Directors' report, quoted in MacDermot volume II page 67 In fact the entire Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth network, 131 miles of line, now GWR property, was to be converted to standard gauge, triggered by the opening of the B&NSR; line. The standard gauge was ready for the first time on 22 June 1874. The GWR continued with the upgrading of the Frome to Witham line, making it ready for passenger operation; this included laying a west curve at Frome to reach the station there; the mineral line connection faced Westbury. On 5 July 1875 following an inspection by Col Yolland, the line opened to passengers. There were five trains between Bristol and Frome via Radstock daily, with two on Sundays. MacDermot summarises the events from the GWR point of view in stark terms: > The opening of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway, a line with a tragic > financial story too involved to be recounted here, and of little interest > nowadays, created a new break of gauge at Radstock, where it joined the old > Great Western mineral branch from Frome; so, until the latter was converted > to narrow gauge in June 1874, the 23 miles between Bristol and Frome had of > course to be worked in two distinct sections, the southern of which was not > adapted for passenger traffic until the 5th July 1875.MacDermot volume II, > page 84 =Poor financial results= On 20 July 1874 the Somerset and Dorset Railway opened its Bath extension, passing through Radstock. Running through Midsomer Norton and Radstock from the south-west it crossed over the B&NSR; between the two places, paralleling the B&NSR; through Radstock itself. There were thus two adjacent level crossings in the centre of the town. The Bath extension exhausted the S&DR; Company financially, and it leased its line to the Midland Railway and the London and South Western Railway jointly on 13 July 1876, and became known as the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway.Robin Atthill & O S Nock, The Somerset & Dorset Railway, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1967, The opening of the line gave easy rail access to cheap Midlands coal which was now brought into the area. The Somerset coalfield had the limitation that the seams were narrow and had exceptionally high costs, which were now massively undercut. Miners' wages were reduced leading to industrial action, and local coal production declined. In addition deficient siding accommodation led to congestion in actually getting offered traffic away. The Company had assumed that the GWR would route through goods traffic over its line, and the GWR did not rush to do this, preferring their own double track line via Bradford on Avon. The Company sustained a loss of ¬£5,600 in 1876. The situation revived somewhat, and the former WS&WR; section carried heavy volumes of coal, and was partly doubled in 1880. Easier coal seams were exploited and deep pits at Pensford and Dunkerton were sunk in the period 1901 - 1920, resulting in a 25% increase in the area's production. For the entire life of the reconstructed B&NSR; Company, money had been short and the line had been worked by the GWR. From time to time negotiations had been opened with a view to selling the line to the larger company, and these were repeatedly fruitless. The B&NSR; had huge debts and was making a loss every year, and it is unlikely that the GWR would pay dearly to acquire it. The shareholders may have expected a sale price that would get them their money back; an unrealistic expectation that led them to reject an offer when the GWR made it in 1880, even though the Directors recommended acceptance. Resentment against the GWR for supposedly excessive charges for working the line were also a factor. The Earl of Warwick had long been owed ¬£113,000 and in January 1882 judgement in his favour was given in the court. The B&NSR; had no money to pay, and were put in receivership.But not bankruptcy. =A hostile rival= A remarkable Parliamentary Bill was submitted for the 1883 session: a Bristol and South Western Junction Railway was to be created. Its route would leave Andover, on the LSWR main line and run via Amesbury and Westbury to Radstock, where it would join both the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway and the Bristol and North Somerset line. The latter would be doubled, and a new central Bristol station would be built adjacent to the floating harbour, as well as a new central goods station at Lewins Mead. From a much more convenient Bristol station, the journey to London over this route and the LSWR was only 12 miles longer than by the GWR. The capital was to be ¬£1,866,000. Although the proposal had some popular support, all the directly affected parties opposed the scheme, and during its passage in Parliament it was considerably scaled down. However the preamble was shown not to be proved, and the Bill failed. This had been a direct assault by the LSWR and its friends on the heartland of the GWR network, and if it had succeeded it could have tapped the GWR's core traffic at a number of locations; and in consequence the GWR started to think more defensively about its position. This seems to have pushed the GWR into granting better terms to purchase the B&NSR; line, and the Bristol and North Somerset Railway was amalgamated with the GWR in July 1884;D W Warnock and R G Parsons, The Bristol and North Somerset Railway since 1884, Avon Anglia Productions, Bristol, 1979, Warnock's date, confirmed by Carter; MacDermot says, on page 76 of volume II, that it was absorbed on 3 September 1874. the WS&WR; had been absorbed by the GWR in 1850, so that the entire line between Bristol and Frome via Radstock was in GWR control and was operated as a single unit. Features Pensford Viaduct The original stations were in most cases built to a standard but distinctive design by the architect William Clarke, featuring large canopies and three tall chimneys. The B&NSR; was one of the railways carried on the Midford viaducts (see photograph above). This had three levels: the B&NSR; traversed a river valley on a bridge which crossed by the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway which crossed the line and the river valley on an almost perpendicular course on a viaduct. The biggest civil engineering project on the line was the Pensford Viaduct over the River Chew. The viaduct is long, reaches a maximum height of to rail level and consists of sixteen arches and is now a Grade II listed structure. Until 1966 there was no running connection between the North Somerset route and the Somerset and Dorset line; occasional wagon exchange took place through Ludlow Pit private siding; the owner charged 1s 0d per wagon exchanged in this way. =Topography= The line was single throughout. The line left the Bristol to Bath main line at North Somerset Junction, a little east of station. An east curve was later built giving access towards Bath, in connection with the enhanced goods facilities at East Depot in 1892. This line trailed in at Marsh Junction, where the Bristol Relief line immediately diverged, towards Pylle Hill. Passenger stations on the line were then: * Brislington * Whitchurch Halt, opened 1925 * Pensford * Clutton * Hallatrow; the Camerton line trailed in * Farrington Gurney Halt, opened 1927 * Welton; renamed Welton and Midsomer Norton in 1898, and renamed Midsomer Norton and Welton in 1904 * Radstock; renamed Radstock West in 1949 * Mells Road On the Camerton line from Hallatrow, the passenger stations were: * Paulton Halt, opened 1914 * Radford and Timsbury Halt, opened 1910 * Camerton * Dunkerton Colliery Halt, opened 1911 * Dunkerton * Combe Hay Halt * Midford Halt, opened 1911 * Monkton Combe, opened 1910 The line joined the Bathampton to Bradford on Avon line at Limpley Stoke. The B&NSR; main line was steeply graded; leaving Marsh Junction it climbed at 1 in 62 to Brislington station, continuing at 1 in 60 to Whitchurch, a single platform halt, continuing to climb to the bridge for the Norton Malreward road. The line then fell at 1 in 66 to Pensford, where there was a sixteen arch viaduct. The line then climbed again, passing Pensford Pit; reaching another summit it fell at 1 in 169, and then 1 in 71 towards Clutton, first passing sidings that accessed a siding serving Fry's Bottom Pit. The sidings at Clutton handled coal from Greyfield Pit. The line now fell at 1 in 58 to Hallatrow, where the Camerton line trailed in. There was a short bay platform for Camerton branch passenger trains. Rising again, the line climbed at 1 in 65 and then fell again to Farrington Gurney Halt, where passengers obtained tickets at the Miner's Arms public house. Farrington Pit was alongside. Continuing to fall, the line reached Midsomer Norton and Welton passenger station and finally Radstock, later named Radstock West. Services The passenger service was typical for a rural railway; in 1884 there were five passenger trains in each direction. By 1910, there were eight trains a day on Thursdays and Saturdays, fewer on other weekdays, and not all of those ran through to or from Frome. On 28 December 1946 the dirt batch at Pensford Pit slipped, burying and blocking the line; it was closed there for three months, with passenger operation from Bristol to Pensford and from Clutton to Frome. In the 1950s new and efficient bus services were introduced in the greater Bristol area; there had been good business from passengers travelling to work in Bristol, and the bus services hit passenger carryings on the line. In September 1958 the passenger service on the line was halved. Nonetheless the line was stated to be losing ¬£18,542 annually, and the last passenger train ran on 31 October 1959. Later events The line crossed the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway at Radstock, and when that line closed to all traffic on 6 March 1966, there was a need to continue to serve a colliery at Writhlington, a little east of Radstock. As the Bristol and North Somerset line was still open for mineral traffic, a connection between the two lines was formed at Radstock, and for a period Writhlington was served in that way. Somerset coal continued to be transported to the Bristol area, although not in the former volumes, until the embankment near Pensford was washed out in the summer of 1968. It was considered uneconomic to reinstate it, but the former WS&WR; line to Frome was intact, although it had been dormant since April 1966. Accordingly, the line to Frome was re-opened and Somerset coal ran to Bristol via Frome. The Bristol and North Somerset line was finally closed north of the washout site to Marsh Junction, Bristol. Nonetheless the coalfield was in terminal decline, and the last pit closed in 1973; the final revenue movement of coal on the line was on 16 November 1973. There was an independent wagon repair activity at Radstock, and that continued to be rail served for a time. The Camerton branch The Camerton branch had been authorised by the original Act for the Bristol and North Somerset Railway, but not proceeded with by the impecunious company. Coal had been extracted for some time at Camerton ‚Äî the Camerton New Colliery had been opened in 1800 ‚Äî and in the 1873 session of Parliament the B&NSR; received authority to build the branch; the Act was passed on 21 July with capital of ¬£40,000; the GWR was permitted to fund the construction. The development of this scheme for a relatively short branch line seems to have been ill-prepared. Only after the passage of the Act was Clarke, the Company's engineer, told to prepare detailed estimates for the construction. At a Board meeting on 30 June 1875 was it decided to start negotiations with the Somerset Coal Canal Company to get permission to cross its canal. On 24 October 1875 the GWR accepted a tender for the construction from W Monsley in the sum of ¬£19,000. Evidently the B&NSR; had persuaded the GWR to handle the management of the work. In October 1880 and again on 21 May 1881 Major-General Hutchinson performed the formal inspection of the line and, with some comments, approved the line for opening. The construction had cost ¬£42,214. It appears that the GWR had funded the construction on the basis of a promise of reimbursement by the B&NSR;, for Vincent records that \\"a special meeting was held of the North Somerset's board of directors on 31 March 1882 which then allowed the company to raise the Camerton branch capital\\".Page 103 Although authorised for opening in 1881, no colliery company applied for a siding connection, and for a period the line remained in suspense. In fact it opened for passengers and goods and mineral traffic on 1 March 1882.Colin G Maggs, Branch Lines of Somerset, Alan Sutton Publishing Limited, Stroud, 1993, The line was three miles long and very steeply graded, falling at 1 in 47 from Hallatrow, that is, against the loaded direction. Train loads were limited to fifteen wagons. The opening of the branch hit the Somerset Coal Canal hard, and by 1898 it was derelict. In 1903 the GWR purchased the canal for ¬£2,000, and extended the Camerton branch along the canal alignment to Limpley Stoke, there forming a junction with the GWR line from Bath to Trowbridge. The first section, about a mile in length from Camerton, reached Dunkerton Pit, and was opened on 26 August 1908, and the remainder on 9 May 1910. From that time most of the coal was routed via Freshford sidings. A passenger service was operated on the Camerton branch from the time of opening as a through line; but despite serving mining communities, there was little business. Attempts to run an economic service with railmotors were made, but the passenger service was discontinued during the First World War, ceasing on 22 March 1915. It was restored in the summer of 1923 (on 9 July) as an experimental service, omitting Midford Halt, but was finally abandoned on 21 September 1925. Goods services on the section from Hallatrow to Camerton ceased on the same day; the track was lifted on this section about 1930. Goods and mineral traffic continued, accessed at the Limpley Stoke end only, but that finally closed too on 15 February 1951 and the track was taken up in 1958. =The Titfield Thunderbolt= East-west beneath north-south: the Camerton branch viaduct (left) is dwarfed by the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway viaduct at Midford The Camerton line achieved some fame after closure. The Ealing Studios film, The Titfield Thunderbolt, was shot in 1953 using the line. The plot of the film involved a rural line being closed to passengers by British Railways, so local people club together and, against all the odds, run their own passenger service. Future potential reopening Numerous proposals have been made to reopen the railway line in some form, most involving the still-existing branch line from Frome to Radstock. A consultation report produced by Halcrow Group in 2014 outlines the feasibility reinstating service on that branch which was estimated to cost ¬£40 million in 2013. Furthermore, the possibility of opening a heritage railway line has been discussed. The former line through Bristol via Brislington and Whitchurch has been described by pressure group Transport for Greater Bristol as 'technically feasible' but would require a large land acquisition budget due to most of the old route being built over. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line from Frome to Radstock as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments). p.42 Notes References Further reading * Colin G Maggs, The Bristol - Radstock - Frome Line, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2013, * Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Frome to Bristol: Including the Camerton Branch, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1996, * Bradshaw's Railway Guide, April 1910 edition, reprinted by David & Charles, 1968 * Mike Oakley, Somerset Railway Stations, Dovecote Press, Wimborne, 2002, * External links * Signalling of the Camerton Branch Category:Rail transport in Somerset Category:Great Western Railway constituents Category:Transport in Bath and North East Somerset Category:Rail transport in Bristol Category:Rail transport in Wiltshire Category:Railway lines opened in 1873 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1875 Category:Closed railway lines in South West England Category:1873 establishments in England Category:Railway companies established in 1873 Category:1875 disestablishments in England Category:British companies established in 1873 Category:British companies disestablished in 1875 ","title":"Bristol and North Somerset Railway"},{"id":"9528259","text":"H-hour (redundant acronym of hour) was the name given to the airborne assault during the Normandy landings of World War II. The units involved included the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, along with the British 6th Airborne Division. This took place about three hours before the main beach landings on the Normandy coast. The airborne invasion consisted of over 20,000 men and around 1,200 planes and gliders. The combined assault of the three Allied airborne divisions would surprise the German defenders and cause enough havoc behind the German lines, enabling the beach landings to go more smoothly. Objectives of H-hour The divisions of paratroopers that landed each had an objective: *The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division would drop and take the town of Sainte-M√®re-√âglise and protect the right flank on the American beach landings of Omaha Beach and Utah Beach. After doing that, they would link up with the 101st. *The U.S. 101st Airborne Division would be dropped behind Utah Beach, to secure the beach exits and be prepared to exploit through the town of Carentan. *The British 6th Airborne Division would be dropped between the river Orne and some high ground of the Bois de Bavent to secure the eastern flank of the British and Canadian sector, landing at Sword Beach and Juno Beach, respectively. Dropping the troops When the airborne divisions were dropped, there were many mis-drops. Some were dropped as far away from their designated DZ (drop zone) as 20 miles. Some were even dropped in the English Channel. Often, the C-47's and modified B-23's that were used in the drops came under heavy fire and were forced to drop their Airborne members prematurely. Pilots were often heavily criticized for this. Another reason why many mis-drops occurred is because, while crossing the English Channel the transport aircraft's formations (\\"flying V's\\") flew through low lying clouds. The lack of visibility caused pilots to often drift away from the lead plane to avoid a crash. This caused many pilots to have their bearings off and flying just a few degrees off course, which added up when this was done for several miles.

Prelude The nationalists had lost three divisions to the enemy by October, 1946 in northeast China, and the local nationalist commander, Du Yuming adjusted the strategy by planning to eradicate the enemy in a gradual but firm manner, instead of attempting to eliminate the enemy rapidly by a decisive engagement, which the enemy had refused to do. The heart of this new strategy called for the elimination of the enemy base south of the Songhua River, headquartered at Linjiang. After the enemy had been eradicated in the south, the nationalists would then advance northward across the Songhua River and eliminate the enemy forces there. In response to the nationalist strategy, the communist commander of northeast China, Lin Biao, and his followers accurately concluded that the communist base south of the Songhua River must be maintained at all costs, because it served to distract the enemy and if it were lost, the enemy could then devote its entire assets to pressure the communists north of the Songhua River, and the communists in northeast China would then be endangered, and possibly face total annihilation. The communists decided to concentrate three columns with a total of nine divisions to stop the nationalist offensives, along with the help of three independent divisions. Order of battle Nationalist order of battle *The Newly Organized 1st Army **The Newly Organized 22nd Division **The Newly Organized 30th Division *The Newly Organized 6th Army *The 52nd Army **The 2nd Division **The 195th Division *The 60th Army *The 91st Division of the 71st Army *The 21st Division *The 87th Division *The 88th Division *The 89th Division *The 207th Division *The 54th Division of the 13th Army Communist order of battle *The 3rd Column *The 4th Column *The 6th Column *The 1st Independent Division *The 2nd Independent Division *The 3rd Independent Division First stage On December 17, 1946, the nationalists sent out six divisions, including the 2nd division, the 195th Division of the 52nd Army, the 91st Division of the 71st Army, one Division from each of the Newly Organized 1st Army, the Newly Organized 6th Army, and the 60th Army to launch the first offensive against the communist base south of Songhua River, and two more Divisions were deployed as reserves. The initial nationalist objective was to linkup Tonghua with Ji'an (ÈõÜÂÆâ) so that the enemy could be further squeezed into the mountain. In response, on December 18, 1946, the communist 4th Column struck the regions between Fushun, Huanren and Benxi behind the enemy lines, and after more than a dozen days of fighting, succeeded in taking over more than twenty positions from the nationalists, including the critical ones at Alkaline Factory (Jian Chang, Á¢±ÂéÇ) and Master Field (Tian Shifu, Áî∞Â∏à‰ªò), and killing more than 3,000 nationalist troops in the process. The nationalist 91st Division of the 71st Army was forced to withdraw to reinforce the rear, and this weakened the nationalist thrust by exposing the two divisions of the nationalist 52nd Army, which were ultimately badly mauled by the enemy who seized the opportunity and attacked with great efficiency and speed, resulting in the regions south of Tonghua newly taken by the nationalists earlier in the initial stage of the offensive falling back into the enemy hands. In the north, the communists massed three columns and three independent divisions to cross the Songhua River and on January 5, 1947, to besiege the nationalist strategic location of Pagoda Wood (Tamu, Â°îÊú®), forced the nationalist offensive into a complete halt and then redeploying two attacking divisions to reinforce Pagoda Wood (Tamu, Â°îÊú®). However, when the nationalist reinforcements reached the region between Zhangmazi Ditch (Zhangmazi Gou, Âº†È∫ªÂ≠êÊ≤ü) and the Jiao Family's Ridge (Jiajia Ling,ÁÑ¶ÂÆ∂Â≤≠), they learned that Pagoda Wood (Tamu, Â°îÊú®) had already fallen into enemy hands, with the entire garrison consisting of a security force regiment and two regiments of the Newly Organized 1st Army being completely annihilated by the enemy. The enemy consequently returned to north of the Songhua River on January 19, 1947. Achieving their objectives when the nationalists stopped their assault on Linjiang, the communists withdrew to their original bases and the nationalists could not pursuit the enemy anymore due to the sudden change of the weather when the temperature suddenly dropped to forty degrees below zero. Second stage The nationalists correctly assessed that they must avoid fighting at the two fronts and thus attacks on the communist base in the south must continue in order to eliminate the enemy. On January 30, 1947, a second offensive was launched with four divisions: the 21st Division, the 2nd Division, the 195th Division of the 52nd Army, and the 207th Division. The communists in turn, deployed the 3rd Column and the 10th Division of the 4th Column to stop the nationalist offensive and on February 5, 1947, the weakest nationalist division, the 195th Division of the 52nd Army was ambushed at Gaolichengzi (È´òÂäõÂüéÂ≠ê), and suffered more than 2,000 fatalities. On February 6, 1947, a regiment of the advance guard of the nationalist 207th Division was annihilated at Sanyuanpu (‰∏âÊ∫êÊµ¶) by dusk, and after the setback, the commander of the nationalist 207th Division wisely chose to stop and withdraw. Meanwhile, the communist 4th Column once again struck the regions between Fushun (ÊäöÈ°∫), Huanren (Ê°ì‰ªÅ) and Benxi (Êú¨Ê∫™) deep behind the nationalist lines to capture numerous nationalist strongholds, and when combined with communist victories elsewhere, eventually succeeded in forcing the second nationalist offensive to a complete stop again, and the nationalists were forced to give up the newly conquered lands when one division was redeployed to reinforce the rear and other begun their withdraw. Third Stage In 1947, Xiao Jinguang and Chen Yun were in Linjiang. Just a week after the failure of the second offensive, the nationalists launched their third offensive against the enemy by deploying the 2nd Division, the 195th Division of the 52nd Army, the 91st Division of the 71st Army, the Newly Organized 22nd Division of the Newly Organized 1st Army and the 21st Division to attack in four fronts on February 13, 1947. A detachment of the communist 4th Column again played the same trick that was effective in the previous two counteroffensives: struck the regions between Fushun, Huanren and Benxi deep behind the nationalist line again and attracting three nationalist divisions so that they could not be used to attack the communist base south of Songhua River, while in the meantime, the communist 3rd Column and the 4th Column first annihilated an entire regiment of the nationalist 21st Division at Tonggou (ÈÄöÊ≤ü), and then annihilated another regiment of the nationalist 91st Division of the 71st Army at Daibeicha (Â§ßÂåóÂ≤î), forcing the two nationalist Divisions to withdraw on February 22, 1947. The newly gained territory/towns in the nationalist third offensive such as Huinan (ËæâÂçó), Golden River (Jinchuan, ÈáëÂ∑ù), Willow River (Liuhe, Êü≥Ê≤≥) and Ji'an (ÈõÜÂÆâ) therefore fell back into the enemy hands. On the other front, the communist force crossed the Songhua River on February 21, 1947, and attacked regions surrounding Changchun to distract the nationalists. After annihilating an entire regiment of the Newly Organized 30th Division of the Newly Organized 1st Army at the town of Chengzi Street (Chengzi Jie, ÂüéÂ≠êË°ó), the communist 6th Column turned north and linked up with the communist 2nd Independent Division to besiege Dehui (Âæ∑ÊÉ†) in order to draw nationalist forces away from the communist base. The plan succeeded and the nationalists redeployed the Newly Organized 1st Army (including its Newly Organized 22nd Division), the 87th Division, and the 88th Division to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms. The enemy force wisely chose to withdraw back to the north of Songhua River on March 2, 1947, before the nationalist reinforcement could reach Dehui. The nationalists were determined not to let the enemy to get away so they continued their push northward, but in doing so, the nationalist forces were severely overstretched. Seizing the opportunity, the enemy crossed the Songhua River again on March 8, 1947, for the third time to attack, and the nationalist commanders had no choice but to order a general retreat. However, the retreating nationalist force was caught up by the pursuing enemy and the nationalist 88th Division was annihilated at the Village of the Mountain of Guo (Guo-shan Tun, ÈÉ≠Â±±Â±Ø), and the nationalist 87th Division was badly mauled at the Village Next to the Mountain (Kao-shan Tun, Èù†Â±±Â±Ø). On March 12, 1947, Nong'an (ÂÜúÂÆâ) was besieged and the nationalists were forced to redeploy the Newly Organized 1st Army (including its Newly Organized 22nd Division) and the 54th Division of the 13th Army from Rehe (ÁÉ≠Ê≤≥) to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms again. Succeeding in distracting the nationalists who had to stop their third offensives, the enemy withdrew to the north of Songhua River. Fourth Stage Not wanting to admitting defeat, the nationalists launched their fourth offensive against the communist base south of Songhua River on March 26, 1947, with a total strength of twenty regiments attacking in three fronts. The enemy, in response, targeted the central front headed by the nationalist 89th Division, who was dangerously exposed because its push was much too fast. While other enemy units resisted the nationalist left and right fronts, the main body of the enemy force ambushed the 89th Division of the nationalist central front on April 1, 1947, annihilating the entire Division. Hearing the news of the annihilation of the nationalist 89th Division, the nationalists on the other two fronts immediately withdrew. The failure of the nationalist fourth offensive marked the end of campaign because the units deployed were the same ones that participated in earlier offensives, and thus were gravely overworked and overstretched. The nationalists could not afford to expend anymore valuable troops and must reserve their strength to defend the territory currently under their control. Outcome The Linjiang Campaign marked the turning point of the battlefield in northeast China: after this communist victory, the nationalists in northeast China were forced to be on the defensive, and could no longer launch any offensives, while in contrast, the communists would be on the offensive from then on. It must be said, however, the nationalists were still quite capable of knocking out the entire communist force in northeast China if the right tactics were applied, such as concentrating on annihilating the enemy force instead of gaining and holding on to more land, as suggested by many local nationalist commanders, but their correct suggestion was overridden by Chiang Kai-shek infatuation with conquering more land. Furthermore, even if the nationalists were unable to annihilate the enemy at the time, they could still reserve their strength by giving up northeast China and saving troops, and had the situation improved, the nationalists would be able to retake northeast China, as suggested by Chen Cheng in 1946. Again, this alternative would also contradicting with Chiang's uncompromising stand, which ultimately doomed the nationalists.

It is endemic to Great Britain and currently known only from North Wales. It is a recently evolved plant that arose suddenly as a result of hybridization between two related species. Origin Welsh groundsel is an allopolyploid, a plant that contains sets of chromosomes originating from two different species. Its ancestor was Senecio √ó baxteri, an infertile hybrid that can arise spontaneously when the closely related groundsel (Senecio vulgaris) and Oxford ragwort (Senecio squalidus) grow alongside each other. Sometime in the early 20th century, an accidental doubling of the number of chromosomes in an S. √ó baxteri plant led to the formation of a new fertile species, Welsh groundsel. Distribution and habitat It was first discovered in 1948 by Horace E. Green at Ffrith in Flintshire, north-east Wales. The species was described in 1955 by Effie M. Rosser of Manchester Museum using material from the site. It was later found at a number of sites across the north-east of Wales including Chirk, Brymbo, Queensferry and Colwyn Bay and a herbarium specimen was discovered that had been collected at Brynteg in 1925. In England it was reported from Shropshire and an introduced population appeared in Wolverhampton. The Shropshire record is now thought to be erroneous and the Wolverhampton plants have disappeared. There are no recent records from England. In 1982, Welsh groundsel was discovered at several sites around Edinburgh, Scotland. Another case of dual evolutionary locations is Erythranthe peregrina, which arose in two separate parts of Scotland. This population arose independently from the Welsh population; it is believed to date from at least 1974 but now appears to have disappeared with no records since 1993. Typical habitats of the species include waste ground, roadsides and cracks in walls and pavements. Description The plant is intermediate in appearance between its parents, groundsel and Oxford ragwort. It is an erect annual plant that reaches a height of 30 (sometimes 50) centimetres. The stem and leaves have few or no hairs. The leaves are deeply lobed. The lower leaves have stalks, whereas the upper leaves are attached directly to the stem. The flower heads are cylindrical and usually have 8 to 15 yellow ray florets (\\"petals\\") although some are rayless. The ray florets vary in length but are most commonly 4 to 7 mm long. The pollen grains are 30 to 36 micrometres across and usually have 4 pores. References *Abbott R. J. & Forbes D. G.

They would thus provide the ideological support of the future \\"Dirty War\\" carried out by the Argentine military in the 1970s. Many members of the group had taken part in the pro-\\"French Algeria\\" OAS terrorist group created in Madrid, which attempted to block the implementation of the March 1962 √âvian Accords and also tried several times to assassinate General Charles de Gaulle, whom the French far-right felt had deceived them. Following the dismantlement of the OAS and execution of some of its members, the OAS chaplain, Fr. Georges Grasset, organised the flight of OAS members, from a route going from Paris to Franquist Spain and finally to Argentina. Grasset arrived in 1962 in Buenos Aires to take charge of the Argentine branch of the Cit√© Catholique. Charles Lacheroy, a member of this group, was the first person to reflect on the reasons behind the 1954 French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, which all but put an end to the Indochina War (1946‚Äì54). Roger Trinquier, who theorised the systemic use of torture in counter-insurgency in Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency (1961), was also a member of this organisation. Along with Colonel , chief French expert in psychological warfare, Jean Ousset developed the concept of \\"subversion\\". According to Argentine journalist Horacio Verbitsky, \\"this conceived a protean, quintessential enemy who, rather than being defined by his actions, was seen as a force trying to subvert Christian order, natural law or the Creator's plan.\\" According to Ousset, \\"the revolutionary apparatus is ideological before it is political, and political before it is military.\\" Le Marxisme- L√©ninisme In Le Marxisme-L√©ninisme, Jean Ousset wrote that Marxists could only be combatted by \\"a profound faith, an unlimited obedience to the Holy Father, and a thorough knowledge of the Church's doctrines.\\" The first translated version of this book was in Spanish, published in Argentina in 1961 and for which Antonio Caggiano, Archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1965, wrote a prologue, where he thanked the \\"men of La Ciudad Cat√≥lica of Argentina.\\" In this prologue, Caggiano explained that Marxism was born of \\"the negation of Christ and his Church put into practice by the Revolution\\" and spoke of a Marxist conspiracy to take over the world, for which it was necessary to \\"prepare for the decisive battle,\\" although the enemy had not yet \\"taken up arms.\\" The Argentine journalist Horacio Verbitsky commented this: \\"As often happens in a continent that imports ideas, the doctrine of annihilation preceded that of the revolutionary uprising.\\" Caggiano compared this vigilance to the one that preceded the 1571 Battle of Lepanto \\"to save Europe from domination by the Turks.\\" Ousset's book also included a list of the papal bulls condemning communism. Colonel Jean Gardes arrived in Argentina in 1963. Her daughter showed in 2003 to French journalist Marie-Monique Robin notes from her father, which show that in March 1963, a naval lieutenant commander, Federico Lucas Roussillon, offered Gardes Argentine government protection if he would deliver counter-insurgency courses at the ESMA, the Navy Mechanic Schools.Marie-Monique Robin, Escadrons de la mort, l'√©cole fran√ßaise, 453 pages.

Written between 1916 and early 1917, the poem was first published in the June 1917 issue of the Little Review, and became the title poem in the Yeats's 1917 and 1919 collections The Wild Swans at Coole. It was written during a period when Yeats was staying with his friend Lady Gregory at her home at Coole Park, and the assembled collection was dedicated to her son, Major Robert Gregory (1881‚Äì1918), a British airman killed during a friendly fire incident in the First World War. Literary scholar Daniel Tobin writes that Yeats was melancholy and unhappy, reflecting on his advancing age, romantic rejections by both Maud Gonne and her daughter Iseult Gonne, and the ongoing Irish rebellion against the British. Tobin reflects that the poem is about the poet's search for a lasting beauty in a changing world where beauty is mortal and temporary.Tobin, Daniel E. ‚ÄúYeats‚Äôs Personal Utterance in ‚ÄòThe Wild Swans at Coole.‚Äô‚Äù Yeats Eliot Review, (11:3), Summer 1992, 57-63.

Gardner tried to avoid him, going as far as requesting a transfer to another island. Priven, meanwhile, tried to get his Peace Corps service extended for another year so he could stay near Gardner. Tonga's Peace Corps director denied both requests. A few months before Priven's two-year Peace Corps service was completed, a party was held for all the volunteers on Tonga. Both Priven and Gardner attended. Many volunteers became intoxicated, including Gardner. She left the party with a male volunteer, who escorted her to her house. This was witnessed by Priven, who became jealous. Murder On October 14, 1976, less than a week after the party, a local Tongan man heard screams coming from Gardner's house and rushed to the scene. He reported seeing Priven attempting to drag Gardner out of the house. As soon as Priven noticed the witness, he released Gardner and fled on a bicycle. Gardner later died from 22 stab wounds, but not before she was able to name her assailant. Priven attempted suicide by taking Darvon and cutting his wrists, but changed his mind and sought out a friend to accompany him to the police to turn himself in. He was charged with murder and tried in Tonga. Trial  At trial, the prosecution claimed that Priven killed Gardner in anger over his rejection. For his defense, Priven was represented by lawyer Clive Edwards, who would later become deputy Prime Minister of Tonga.\\"New Cabinet lineup: 1 woman, 2 Demo Party members, 2 nobles\\" , Taimi Media Network, December 30, 2010 A psychiatrist hired by the Peace Corps testified that Priven was a paranoid schizophrenic who proclaimed himself to be Gardner's Jesus Christ and that Gardner was possessed by the devil. Priven was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Despite the verdict, the Tongan justice system was reluctant to release Priven. After receiving a letter from the U.S. State Department promising he would be involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, Tonga handed him over to the U.S. government. When Priven arrived in the U.S., however, Priven requested and was granted release, as the government discovered it had no legal grounds to hold him. Under pressure from his family and the Peace Corps, Priven ultimately agreed to a psychiatric evaluation. He was interviewed by a psychiatrist associated with the hospital where the government had intended him to serve his commitment. His diagnosis fit the prosecution's theory; Priven had suffered a \\"situational psychosis\\" after being rejected by Gardner. Since the diagnosis determined that Priven was not schizophrenic, he could not be committed. Priven returned to New York City after his release and worked for the Social Security Administration until his retirement. Criticism  The Peace Corps has been criticized for its handling of the murder, particularly since a book on the case was published in 2005, acquainting a wider public with the details. Criticisms include that Priven's defense in Tonga was supplied by the Peace Corps, that the Peace Corps allegedly went to great efforts to cover up the incident, and that Priven was not suffering from a psychiatric disorder that would have allowed him to mount a successful psychiatric defense in a U.S. court. In 2005, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle looked into the possibility of bringing charges against Priven for the murder, but concluded that he could not be tried in any jurisdiction in the U.S. Although a 1994 law allows prosecutors to bring charges against an American citizen who kills another American citizen while overseas, and the PATRIOT Act allows U.S. Courts to try Americans for crimes they may have committed while overseas, neither of these laws were in effect in 1976 and they cannot therefore be applied retroactively to the Gardner murder case.Les Blumenthal. Prosecutors reject second trial in slaying of Peace Corps volunteer, The News Tribune (reproduction on PeaceCorpsOnline), June 18, 2005. Although Priven's psychiatrist at his trial testified that he suffered from latent paranoid schizophrenia, a panel of psychiatrists who discussed the murder as a case study in 2005 concluded that Priven was probably suffering from narcissistic personality disorder, which manifests itself as an obsessive involvement with one's own interests and a lack of empathy for others. They further concluded that had Priven been charged in an American court, he would not have been able to mount a successful defense \\"by reason of insanity.\\"Philip Weiss.\\"American Taboo: A Peace Corps Tragedy,\\" PeaceCorpsOnline.org, June 20, 2005.

Many variations are strongly associated with British cuisine. Recipes vary greatly and can be desserts or savoury courses. They are typically boiled or steamed, though some baked variations and recipes adapted for microwave ovens exist. Examples include spotted dick, Christmas pudding, treacle pudding, clootie, jam roly- poly and many others. Savoury versions include rabbit, chicken, game and steak and kidney pudding. The Sussex pond pudding and the Paignton pudding are local variations of suet puddings. History Christmas pudding The suet pudding dates back to at least the start of the 18th century. Mary Kettilby's 1714 A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery gives a receipt for \\"An excellent Plumb-Pudding\\", which calls for \\"one pound of Suet, shred very small and sifted\\" along with raisins, flour, sugar, eggs, and a little salt; these were to be boiled for \\"four hours at least\\". Christmas pudding developed from a meat dish. The ancestor of the suet pudding was pottage, a meat and vegetable stew originating in Roman times. This was prepared in a large cauldron, the ingredients being slow cooked, with dried fruits, sugar and spices added. In the 15th century, Plum pottage was a mixture of meat, vegetables and fruit served at the beginning of a meal. The name suet pudding refers to the fat mixed with the flour; it is the fat from around the kidneys of mammals. Pudding is a British term for foods using this pastry, and the dishes can be sweet deserts or savory dishes. Cultural references In George Orwell's 1947 essay \\"Such, Such Were the Joys,\\" recounting the miseries of his preparatory school education, St Cyprian's School saves money by serving distasteful unsweetened suet pudding as a first course to \\"break the boys' appetites.\\" In his 1941 essay England Your England he has a more benign view of it: :In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings.In: The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius, Part I, England Your England, george-orwell.org See also * English cuisine * List of steamed foods References Category:British puddings Category:Savory puddings Category:Steamed foods ","title":"Suet pudding"},{"id":"9528709","text":"Kerrod Walters (born 20 October 1967) is an Australian former rugby league footballer. A Queensland State of Origin and Australian international representative , he played most of his club football with the Brisbane Broncos, with whom he won the 1992 and 1993 NSWRL Premierships. With twin brother Kevin and older brother Steve, Kerrod Walters holds a unique place in Australian League history. Kerrod Walters was endorsed by the Glenn Lazarus Team as a candidate for the Senate in Queensland at the 2016 federal election. Playing career =Early years= Born in Rockhampton and hailing from Ipswich, Kerrod Walters first showed his talent with the Ipswich Jets alongside brother Kevin and Allan Langer. This combination later became known as \\"the Ipswich connection\\". In 1988 he and Ipswich teammate Langer joined the newly formed Brisbane Broncos to compete in the Winfield Cup premiership. Along with Shane Duffy Walters was named the 1988 Brisbane Broncos season's rookie of the year. =Brisbane Broncos= In 1989 Walters displaced representative hooker Greg Conescu as the Broncos first choice rake and would go on to represent Queensland, being named man-of-the-match in the third game of that year's State of Origin series. After his standout performances for Queensland who won the series 3‚Äì0, Walters was selected for the mid-season Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand where he made his test d√©but in the first test against New Zealand at Queen Elizabeth II Park in Christchurch, scoring a try on d√©but as the Aussies won 26‚Äì6. He would retain his place in the side for the final two tests of the series as Australia swept the Kiwis 3‚Äì0. In the 1990 State of Origin series he out-pointed New South Wales hooker Ben Elias (despite the Blues winning the series 2-1) and was selected to play in the mid-season Tests against New Zealand and France. The Broncos would go on to play in their first finals series in 1990 and Walters was considered an automatic selection for the 1990 Kangaroo tour. History was created when Kerrod and brother Kevin were selected both to tour making them the first ever twins to make a Kangaroo Tour. After disappointing in the shock first Test loss to Great Britain at London's famous Wembley Stadium, he was lost his test spot to Elias for the remainder of the tour. The following year Walters was sent off for punching Western Suburbs Magpies forward Graeme Wynn in a club match, and his resulting two-week suspension opened the way for brother Steve (at the time a two time premiership winner with the Canberra Raiders) to come into both the Queensland and Australian teams. This connection continued when Steve Walters was injured on the 1991 tour of Papua New Guinea and Kerrod was called up to replace him. The two tests against the Kumuls in 1991 would prove to be the final tests of his career in which he would make it onto the field. While Kerrod did not appear in a Test match during 1992, he played his role in the Broncos maiden Grand Final win over St George and their World Club Championship win over English champions Wigan. That year he was awarded the Broncos' player of the year. The Walters brothers had already become the first trio to play for Queensland and Australia when, in 1992, they achieved another milestone when all three were selected to tour with the 1992 Rugby League World Cup Final squad, though while Steve and Kevin played in 10‚Äì6 win over Great Britain at Wembley, Kerrod was not selected in the final XVII.Kerrod Walters at yesterdayshero.com.au1992 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project Kerrod Walters was selected for what would be his final test in the first test of the mid-season Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand in Auckland. Walters was selected on the bench (brother Steve was the starting hooker while Kevin played five-eighth), but did not take the field in the 14‚Äìall draw. This game created history for Australia as it was the first (and so far only) test in which 3 brothers were selected. While his brothers would be selected for the final two tests of the series (both won by Australia), Kerrod would never again gain Australian selection. After the Broncos' back-to-back grand final win in 1993, Walters made his final appearance for Queensland the following year. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Walters played at hooker for defending premiers Brisbane when they hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge. Unfortunately for Walters and the Broncos, in front of a record World Club Challenge crowd of 54,220 at their home ground ANZ Stadium, Wigan gained revenge for their 1992 loss by winning 20‚Äì14.1994 World Club Challenge at Rugby League Project =Super League and England= In 1996, he was cut from the Broncos and signed with Super League club, the Adelaide Rams. In his second season with the Rams, he was dropped from first grade (after a falling out with coach Rod Reddy) but returned to something resembling his best form late in the season after Reddy's sacking. When the club folded at the end of 1998 Walters joined Gateshead Thunder in the Super League but returned to Australia midway through the 1999 season after he and his wife were injured in a car accident while on holiday in Thailand. =Retirement= At the end of the 1999 season, Walters signed a one-year deal with the Broncos but played in just one match from the interchange bench during the 2000 season. That year he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league. In 2004 Walters became the 5th former player inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame. During the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, Walters was included in a list of the Broncos 20 greatest players. In 2013, aged 45 years, Walters survived a heart attack.

He contributed to many publications in both Britain and the United States and wrote scripts for the BBC. In 1946 two of his detective novels were published by John Westhouse: Tomorrow We'll Be Sober and Philosopher's Hemlock. Under the name Michael Stone, he also wrote a children's school story The Master of Magic, published by Peter Lunn in 1947.Main, Peter. Peter Lunn: Children's Publisher, Stirling: Lomax Press, 2010, p. 168. Cranston's intellectual abilities were varied. His first academic book, Freedom: A New Analysis (1954), covered history (the history of liberalism), politics (a precursive discussion of what Sir Isaiah Berlin would later analyse as negative and positive liberty) and a philosophical attempt to resolve or at least elucidate freedom of the will. The philosophical section was the least successful; and Cranston never again attempted pure philosophy. His main academic strengths were as a biographer and as an intellectual historian.http://drtktopecollege.in/pol/sites/default/files/university%20question%20papers/Origins%20and%20characteristics%20of%20ideology.pdf In a controversial paper, Cranston argued that the scarcity of welfare goods and services meant that supposed welfare rights are not really rights at all.Cranston, Maurice. ‚ÄòHuman Rights: Real and Supposed,‚Äô in Political Theory and the Rights of Man, edited by D.

This was shown not only in his clothes but also in his elegant literary style. Elegance extended also to his conversation. At a party for politics students at the London School of Economics in 1965, sherry was much in demand.

The soldiers initially thought the small dog belonged to the Japanese, but after taking her to a nearby prisoner-of-war camp they realized she did not understand commands in Japanese or English.

In the down time, Smoky learned numerous tricks, which she performed for the entertainment of troops with Special Services and in hospitals from Australia to Korea. According to Wynne, Smoky taught him as much as he taught her, and she developed a repertoire beyond that of any dog of her day. In 1944, Yank Down Under magazine named Smoky the \\"Champion Mascot in the Southwest Pacific Area.\\" Smoky's tricks enabled her to become a hero in her own right by helping engineers to build an airbase at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, a crucial airfield for Allied war planes. Early in the Luzon campaign, the Signal Corps needed to run a telegraph wire through a pipe that was in diameter. Soil had sifted through the corrugated sections at the pipe joinings, filling as much as half of the pipe, giving Smoky only four inches of headway in some places. As Wynne himself told the story when he appeared on NBC-TV after World War II: :‚ÄúI tied a string (tied to the wire) to Smoky's collar and ran to the other end of the culvert . . . (Smoky) made a few steps in and then ran back. \`Come, Smoky,' I said sharply, and she started through again. When she was about 10 feet in, the string caught up and she looked over her shoulder as much as to say \`what's holding us up there?' The string loosened from the snag and she came on again. By now the dust was rising from the shuffle of her paws as she crawled through the dirt and mold and I could no longer see her. I called and pleaded, not knowing for certain whether she was coming or not. At last, about 20 feet away, I saw two little amber eyes and heard a faint whimpering sound . . . at 15 feet away, she broke into a run. We were so happy at Smoky's success that we patted and praised her for a full five minutes.‚Äù Smoky's work saved approximately 250 ground crewmen from having to move around and keep operational 40 United States fighters and reconnaissance planes, while a construction detail dug up the taxiway, placing the men and the planes in danger from enemy bombings.\\"A Tribute to the War Dogs of the United States Military\\".

What would have been a dangerous three-day digging task to place the wire was instead completed in minutes. =After the war= When they arrived home from the war, Wynne and Smoky were featured in a page one story with photographs in the Cleveland Press on December 7, 1945. Smoky soon became a national sensation. Over the next 10 years, Smoky and Wynne traveled to Hollywood and all over the world to perform demonstrations of her remarkable skills, which included walking a tightrope while blindfolded. She appeared with Wynne on some of the earliest TV shows in the Cleveland area, including a show of their own on Cleveland's WKYC Channel 3 called Castles in the Air, featuring some of Smoky's unbelievable tricks.Simon, Ron (2004-08-08), \\"Veteran's dog was a loved mascot for unit during World War II\\", News Journal.

First therapy dog According to an Animal Planet investigation, Smoky was the first recorded therapy dog. Her service in this arena began in July 1944 at the 233rd Station Hospital in New Guinea, where she accompanied nurses to see the incoming battlefield casualties from the Biak Island invasion. Smoky was already a celebrity of sorts, as her photograph was in Yank magazine at the same time, which made it easy to get permission. Dr. Charles Mayo of the Mayo Clinic was the commanding officer who allowed Smoky to go on rounds and also permitted her to sleep with Wynne in his hospital bed for five nights. Smoky's work as a therapy dog continued for 12 years, during and after World War II Yorkie Doodle Dandy Yorkie Doodle Dandy: Or, the Other Woman Was a Real Dog, is a book authored by Bill Wynne. It is the memoir of his time with Smoky during World War II and thereafter.

History  In 1990, the average Moldovan spent six years in school, and only 30% of people older than 15 had completed secondary education. After the end of Soviet rule, reforms were established that required nationals to receive a basic education over 10 years, followed by enrollment in a technical school or an institution of higher learning. Grading conventions The lowest grade (mark) in the Moldovan educational system is 1, the highest is 10. To pass a course, a subject, or an exam, the student must obtain a mark of 5 or above. Types of education As of 2007-2008 academic year, Moldova had ten types of primary and secondary schools: *Kindergartens take kids from 3 to 5-6 years. *Primary schools, grades 1-4 *Gymnasiums, grades 5-9 *Lyceums, grades 10-12, Bacalaureat exam *General schools, grades 10-11, no Bacalaureat exam, cannot continue with higher education *Evening schools *Schools of trades, 1 year (grade 12), no Bacalaureat exam, cannot continue with higher education *Vocational schools, 3 years (grades 10-12), no Bacalaureat exam, but can continue with higher education *Vocational lyceums, 3 years (grades 10-12), Bacalaureat exam *Colleges (Colegii), 3 to 4 years, Bacalaureat exam optional, but can continue with higher education *Special schools, grades 1-11, no Bacalaureat exam, cannot continue with higher education Higher education In Moldova, there are 16 state and 15 http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/links/National- reports-2007/National_Report_moldova2007.pdfReport on Moldova's education in 2007 private institutions of higher education, with a total of 126,100 students, including 104,300 in the state institutions, and 21,700 in the private ones. The number of students per 10,000 inhabitants in Moldova has been constantly growing since the collapse of the Soviet Union, reaching 217 in 2000-2001, and 351 in 2005-2006. There are 6,200 faculty members in Moldova's universities, institutes and academies (on average 1 faculty member per 20.3 students). Out of these, only 2,700 (43%) hold PhD degrees, including 358 (5.8%) that also hold the highest academic degree: Habilitation. Moldovan faculty members usually teach around 20 hours per week (one of the highest workloads in the world). 52.5% of students major in economics, law, social sciences, or in some fields that the Moldovan Ministry of Education calls on its website \\"professional formation fields\\", 18.4% study engineering and architecture, 16.0% - education. There are a total of 90 specialities (majors) offered. 101,100 students, or 80.2%, pay for their studies (from 2,000 to 7,300 Moldovan lei per year, i.e. from 120 to 430 euros per year). The state is trying to increase the number of places offered free of charge when students are admitted to public universities: there were 5,085 in 2001, 5,290 in 2002, 5,628 in 2003, 6,354 in 2004, 7,048 in 2005, 7,835 in 2006, but this rate (54% over 5 years) is lower than the rate of increase (65% over the same period) in the total number of places. 15% of the free of charge places are reserved, and distributed to candidates from low-income families. In an effort to support them, the state gives scholarships to 70% of students who occupy the free of charge places, i.e. to 14.4% of the total number of students. As of January 1, 2006, these scholarships are in three categories: 210, 230, or 270 Moldovan lei per month, i.e. 12, 14, or 16 euros per month respectively. 78.4% of students study in Romanian, roughly corresponding to its respective linguistic group,Educa»õia √Æn Republica Moldova, p. 972004 Census results while 19.5% study in Russian (including members of other linguistic groups like Gagauz or Bulgarian). Foreign languages became increasingly less popular in recent years: 1.8% studied in English or French during the 2010-2011 schoolyear, compared to 3.2% in 2006. The National Council on Accreditation and Attestation is an organization that approves the examination programs for doctoral students, confers scientific degrees, and scientific and pedagogical ranks. The Council publishes online all PhD theses that are elaborated and defended in Moldova. =Public universities= Agricultural State University of Moldova #State University of Moldova (Universitatea de Stat din Moldova), Chi≈üinƒÉu, str.

The screen quota system is enforced to prevent foreign markets from making inroads into the domestic film market. The screen quota system was started in the United Kingdom in 1927 through the Cinematograph Films Act 1927. Other countries enforcing screen quotas include France, South Korea, Brazil, Pakistan and Italy. In South Korea The screen quota system has been enforced in South Korea since 1967. The system is: * screening more than 6 Korean films each year and more than 90 screening days each year (1966) * screening more than 3 Korean films each year and more than 30 screening days each year (1970) * more than 1/3 of screening days each year (1973) * more than 2/5 of screening days each year and reciprocal screening of Korean and foreign films in cities of more than 300,000 of population (1985) In South Korea, the screen quota has contributed to the rapid increase in the film market. Until the 1990s, the Korean film market had lacked the ability to raise capital funds for films. The quality of Korean films has increased dramatically, with an inflow of capital funds into South Korean film market since 2000. The government has decided to reduce its 40-year-old screen quotas from 146 days to 73 days in 2006. As a result of the free trade agreement between South Korea and the United States, which was agreed on April 2, 2007, the screen quotas in South Korea will not be subject to change from the current 73 days. =Controversy of limiting screen quotas= The controversy of limiting screen quotas initially stemmed from South Korea-America BIT (Bilateral Investment Treaty). As a solution to South Korea's foreign exchange crisis in 1997, President Kim Daejung suggested BIT between South Korea and the United States in a hope that it would increase credibility of South Korean economy, thus boosting foreign investments. In June 1998, President Kim and Bill Clinton agreed to enforce BIT during Kim's visit to the US American government requested several requirements in opening South Korean market, including the alleviation of screen quotas. American government called for the reduction and abolition of screen quotas for the sake of Hollywood's expansion. Initially, the South Korean government did not expect this to be much of a problem that it agreed to consider it. The representatives tried to reach an agreement by decreasing the duration of screening days to a certain extent. =Domestic protests= When the decision to limit screen quotas was notified to the public, however, the Korean movie industry vehemently opposed the change. The movie industry strongly criticized both the South Korean and American government and struggled to resist the amendments. As the objection grew serious, the issue grasped the attention of the public. Under the name of protecting cultural sovereignty, many in the country sympathized with the movie industry and condemned lessening of screen quotas. =Current situation= The amendment of decreasing screening days to 73 days is in effect today. Mainly two factors contributed to the ratification of amendment. First, United States continued demand for the alleviation of screen quotas. Due to the change in industry structure, Hollywood suffered from increased deficit in its domestic market. One way to deal with this problem was to increase exportation by expanding into the foreign market. By 2004, the South Korean government suggested FTA (Free Trade Agreement) rather than BIT but the United States was hesitant in considering it. The American government urged that South Korea cannot start FTA and continue screen quotas act at the same time. The US demanded an effort to loosen screen quotas system before initiating FTA. This contributed to the alleviation of screen quotas, since the American government had been constantly requesting the abolition of screen quotas since South Korea- America BIT in 1998 while no change have been made, it was not a decisive factor. The major factor was the change in Ministry of Culture and Tourism's stance. Until June 2004, the ministry had consistently sided with the pro screen quotas. The minister Lee Changdong had a background as a movie director and a political chairman of anti-screen quota union. Thus, the minister used to hold a firm stance toward continuation of screen quotas. However, there were several political barriers that resisted Lee from holding onto his belief. The dominant opinion of the politics was that screen quotas should quickly be dealt with by accepting the requirements of America. The government also argued that the screen quota was paralysing other important policies. Moreover, President Roh Muhyeon had a firm belief that South Korea ‚Äì America FTA should be signed as fast as possible, with all the obstacles such as screen quotas being solved quickly. In other countries The United Kingdom is the first country to enforce screen quotas under the Cinematograph Films Act 1927. It introduced a requirement for British cinemas to show a quota of British films for a duration of 10 years. The Act's supporters believed that this would promote the emergence of a vertically integrated film industry, in which production, distribution and exhibition infrastructure are controlled by the same companies. The vertically integrated American film industry saw rapid growth in the years immediately following the end of World War I. The idea, therefore, was to try and counter Hollywood's perceived economic and cultural dominance by promoting similar business practices among British studios, distributors and cinema chains. By creating an artificial market for British films, it was hoped that the increased economic activity in the production sector would eventually lead to the growth of a self-sustaining industry. The quota was initially set at 7.5% for exhibitors, which was raised to 20% in 1935. However, the act is generally not considered as a success, with an absurd influx of poorly made films being produced known as \\"Quota Quickies\\" which were produced purely to fulfill the act. Though 192 films were produced in 1936 alone. Later, The Act was modified by the Cinematograph Films Act 1938 and further acts, and eventually quotas (and levy rates) were abolished in the Films Act 1985. In Brazil, quota is defined by a presidential decree every year. Currently, the requirement depends on the number of screens, varying from 28 days (for single screen movie theatres) to 644 (for 20 screens multiplexes). In Greece, minimum days of showing domestic films each year is 28 days. In Japan, the screen quota was enacted in the early Showa era, and was abolished in 1945. In Spain, the minimum number of screening days of domestic films is between 73 and 91 days. Analysis =Argument for= The example of Mexico shows the fatal result of the ending of the screen quota system. Mexico enforced the screen quota system to prevent being swallowed up by inflow from Hollywood, but repealed the system under pressure from the United States in 1994 when Mexico made the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the U.S. As a result, the film industry in Mexico has suffered seriously in the 10 years following the establishment of NAFTA despite the rapid growth of the Mexican economy. =Argument against= According to the opponents of the quota system, domestic filmmakers have mass-produced low-quality films to meet the screen quota system. As a result, the system leads to a waste of money and human resources and it is most important to strengthen the competitiveness of domestic films in a competitive atmosphere. Messerlin and Parc (2014) and Parc (2017) described the side effects of screen quotas in the Korean film industry in detail.Messerlin, P.A. and Parc, J. 2014, The Effect of Screen Quotas and Subsidy Regime on Cultural Industry: A Case Study of French and Korean Film industry, Journal of International Business and Economy 15(2): 57-73; Parc, J.

History It was designed by Arthur Blomfield in 1887 to take the pressure off the parish's two other churches, the small medieval Old St Mary's and St Saviour's (a Victorian chapel of ease for fishermen on the seafront, opposite the lifeboat house). A spire was designed but never built. Art and architecture The entrance is a three-bay baptistery, into a tall clerestoried nave with narrow aisles either side. The main west window portrays nautical episodes of Christ's life (e.g. the miraculous draught of fishes, preaching from the boat, calming the storm), the instruments of the Passion) and Saints Peter and Paul, whilst both aisles have five sets of three lancets each, with those on the north showing saints and apostles and those on the south side showing Old Testament figures from Moses to Hezekiah. Most windows are by Powell. The aisles end not in complete arches but in lean-to ones, connecting to the vestry (south) and the soldiers' chapel (north). The central nave, on the other hand, is divided from the chancel by a low alabaster screen, showing Blomfield's adherence to the Cambridge Camden Society's ideal that a chancel and nave should be structurally separate. At the east end, at the High altar is a reredos designed by Powell's beneath tall triple lancet windows depicting the Ascension, framed by mosaic images of one angel of the left captioned Sperate (Hope for) and another on the right captioned Surgite (Arise).

With a population of 41,486https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/caribische-deel-van-het- koninkrijk/vraag-en-antwoord/waaruit-bestaat-het-koninkrijk-der-nederlanden as of January 2019 on an area of , it encompasses the southern 40% of the divided island of Saint Martin, while the northern 60% of the island constitutes the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Martin. Sint Maarten's capital is Philipsburg. Collectively, Sint Maarten and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean. Before 10 October 2010, Sint Maarten was known as the Island Territory of Sint Maarten (), and was one of six island territories (eilandgebieden) that constituted the Netherlands Antilles. Sint Maarten has the status of an overseas country and territory (OCT) and is not part of the EU. On 6 and 7 September 2017, the island was hit by Category 5+ Hurricane Irma, which caused widespread and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. As of 2018, Sint Maarten has the 14th largest GDP per capita in the world (including territories) when measured by purchasing power parity, over three times as high as its French counterpart. Etymology The island was named by Christopher Columbus in honour of St Martin of Tours, as he first sighted it on the saint's feast day on 11 November 1493.  History  =Pre-colonial= Sint Maarten had been inhabited by Amerindian peoples for many centuries, with archaeological finds pointing to a human presence on the island as early as 2000 BC. These people most likely migrated from South America. The earliest identified group were the Arawak people who are thought to have settled around the period 800 BC - 300 BC. Circa 1300-1400 AD they began to be displaced with the arrival of the more bellicose Carib peoples. =Arrival of Europeans= The 1633 Spanish capture of Saint Martin, as painted by Juan de la Corte It is commonly believed that Christopher Columbus named the island in honor of Saint Martin of Tours when he encountered it on his second voyage of discovery. However, he actually applied the name to the island now called Nevis when he anchored offshore on November 11, 1493, the feast day of Saint Martin. The confusion of numerous poorly charted small islands in the Leeward Islands meant that this name was accidentally transferred to the island now known as Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten. Nominally Spanish territory, the island became the focus of the competing interest of the European powers, notably France, Britain and the Netherlands. While the French wanted to colonize the islands between Trinidad and Bermuda, the Dutch found San Mart√≠n a convenient halfway point between their colonies in New Amsterdam (present day New York) and New Holland. Meanwhile, the Amerindian population began to decline precipitously, dying from introduced diseases to which they had no immunity. The Dutch built a fort (Fort Amsterdam) on the island in 1631; Jan Claeszen Van Campen became its first governor and the Dutch West India Company began mining salt on the island. Tensions between the Netherlands and Spain were already high due to the ongoing Eighty Years' War, and in 1633 the Spanish captured St Martin and drove off the Dutch colonists. At Point Blanche, they built what is now Old Spanish Fort to secure the territory. The Dutch under Peter Stuyvesant attempted to wrest back control in 1644, but were repulsed.Caribbean: The Lesser Antilles Karl Luntta However, in 1648 the Eighty Years' War ended and the Spanish, no longer seeing any strategic or economic value in the island, simply abandoned it. With Saint Martin free again, both the Dutch and the French jumped at the chance to re-establish their settlements. Dutch colonists came from St. Eustatius, while the French came from St. Kitts. After some initial conflict, both sides realized that neither would yield easily. Preferring to avoid an all-out war, they signed the Treaty of Concordia in 1648, which divided the island in two. During the treaty's negotiation, the French had a fleet of naval ships off shore, which they used as a threat to bargain more land for themselves. In spite of the treaty, relations between the two sides were not always cordial. Between 1648 and 1816, conflicts changed the [France‚ÄìNetherlands borderborder sixteen times. The entire island came under effective French control from 1795 when Netherlands became a puppet state under the French Empire until 1815. In the end, the French came out ahead with ; 61%) against ; 39%) on the Dutch side. =18th-19th centuries= To work the new cotton, tobacco and sugar plantations the French and Dutch began importing large numbers of African slaves, who soon came to outnumber the Europeans. The slave population quickly grew larger than that of the land owners. Subjected to cruel treatment, slaves staged rebellions, and their overwhelming numbers made it impossible to ignore their concerns. In 1848, the French abolished slavery in their colonies including the French side of St. Martin. Slaves on the Dutch side of the island protested and threatened to flee to the French side to seek asylum. The local Dutch authorities then freed the colonies' slaves. While this decree was respected locally, it was not until 1863 when the Dutch abolished slavery in all of their island colonies that the slaves became legally free. =20th century= Statue of Claude Wathey in Philipsburg After the abolition of slavery, plantation culture declined and the island's economy suffered. In 1939 Sint Maarten received a major boost when it was declared a duty-free port. In 1941 the island was shelled by a German U-boat during World War II. Tourism began growing from the 1950s onward, and Princess Juliana International Airport became one of the busiest in the Eastern Caribbean. For much of this period, Sint Maarten was governed by business tycoon Claude Wathey of the Democratic Party.NRC.nl - Sint Maarten bloeit, politici leven in luxe The island's demographics changed dramatically during this period as well, with the population increasing from a mere 5,000 people to around 60,000 people by the mid-1990s. Immigration from the neighbouring Lesser Antilles, Cura√ßao, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the United States, Europe, and Asia turned the native population into a minority.Oostindie 1998:126-127 Sint Maarten became an \\"island territory\\" (eilandgebied in Dutch) of the Netherlands Antilles in 1983. Before that date, Sint Maarten was part of the island territory of the Windward Islands, together with Saba and Sint Eustatius. The status of an island territory entails considerable autonomy summed up in the Island Regulation of the Netherlands Antilles. During this period Sint Maarten was ruled by an island council, an executive council, and a Lieutenant Governor () appointed by the Dutch Crown. Hurricane Luis hit the island in 1995, causing immense destruction and resulting in 12 deaths. =21st century= In 1994 the Kingdom of the Netherlands and France had signed the Franco-Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls, which allows for joint Franco-Dutch border controls on so-called \\"risk flights\\". After some delay, the treaty was ratified in November 2006 in the Netherlands and subsequently entered into force on 1 August 2007. Though the treaty is now in force, its provisions are not yet implemented as the working group specified in the treaty is not yet installed. On 10 October 2010 Sint Maarten became a constituent country () within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, making it a constitutional equal partner with Aruba, Cura√ßao, and the Netherlands proper. Sint Maarten has been assigned the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes of SXM and SX, and the .sx Internet ccTLD became available to register on 15 November 2012.123-reg Blog - Let's talk about .SX! Effects of Hurricane Irma The port in Sint Maarten after Hurricane Irma Damaged buildings in the wake of Hurricane Irma Ground view of Hurricane Irma's damage Hurricane Irma made landfall on 6 September 2017, causing extensive damage. 4 deaths were ultimately reported; there were 11 serious injuries out of a total of 34. Princess Juliana Airport was extensively damaged but reopened on a partial basis in two days to allow incoming relief flights and for flights that would take evacuees to other islands. By 8 September, \\"many inhabitants [were] devoid of basic necessities\\" and looting had become a serious problem. Reports on 9 September indicated that 70% of the infrastructure on the Dutch part had been destroyed. A survey by the Dutch Red Cross estimated that nearly a third of the buildings in Sint Maarten had been destroyed and that over 90 per cent of structures on the island had been damaged. The Prime Minister of the Netherlands told the news media on 8 September that the airport in Sint Maarten was ready to receive emergency flights and that aid, as well as police officers and military personnel, were on their way. The Prime Minister of Sint Maarten had already asked the Dutch government for extended relief assistance which began to arrive on 8 September. The government issued a Tropical Storm Warning on 8 September since the Category 4 Hurricane Jose was approaching. The government of the Netherlands was sending aid, as well as additional police and military, since looting was a serious problem. A statement by the Prime Minister summarized the situation on 8 September. \\"We've lost many, many homes. Schools have been destroyed. We foresee a loss of the tourist season because of the damage that was done to hotel properties, the negative publicity that one would have that it's better to go somewhere else because it's destroyed. So that will have a serious impact on our economy.\\" At the time, preparations were being made as Hurricane Jose approached the island. Government estimates on 9 September indicated that 70 percent of houses were badly damaged or destroyed; much of the population was living in shelters pending the arrival of Jose. Thankfully, this second hurricane did not have a significant impact on the island. Widespread looting had started and a state of emergency was announced; some 230 soldiers from the Netherlands were patrolling. Additional Dutch troops were expected. By 10 September, some 1,200 Americans had been evacuated to Puerto Rico from Sint Maarten by military aircraft during a time of looting and violence. On that date, Royal Caribbean International said that the company was sending its Adventure of the Seas to Saint-Martin and to St. Thomas to provide supplies and to offer evacuation services. The ship arrived on the island on 10 September with water, ice, garbage bags, clothing and canned food, and evacuated 320 people. By 11 September, King Willem-Alexander had already arrived in Cura√ßao and was scheduled to visit St. Maarten, St. Eustatius and Saba. When King Willem-Alexander visited Sint Maarten for the first time post-hurricane, he was shocked by the destruction. He immediately called for support from the European Union so the island could recover swiftly. Later in the month, it was revealed that the EU would allocate ‚Ç¨2 billion in emergency funds for immediate disaster relief to restore basic essentials on Sint Maarten, such as drinking water and sanitation. In addition to the EU's contribution, Red Cross, the government of the Netherlands, and Dutch citizens of the mainland pitched in (via donations and crowdfunding) to raise money for the devastated island. Post hurricane rebuilding On 10 October 2017, Princess Juliana International Airport re-commenced commercial flights using temporary structures, pending repairs. A report in late March 2018 indicated that the airport was able to handle some flights and some service had resumed from the US, Canada, and Europe. A new departure lounge was being used during rebuilding of the original facility. The General Aviation building was being used for passengers arriving on the island. A little over a year after Hurricane Irma, St Maarten's cruise industry had recovered to the extent that in 2018, more than 1 million cruise passengers visited the island. Telecommunications, including Wi-Fi, had been restored on the island, 95% of customers were receiving electricity and drinking water was readily available on the island. Some tourist accommodations were open, with 27 operating and 36 said to be ready sometime later this year. Cruise ships were arriving; a full 14 were accommodated the week of February 18, 2018. Detailed map showing French Sint Maarten, including its territorial waters  Geography  Sint Maarten occupies the southern half of the island of Saint Martin in the Leeward Islands; the northern half forms the French territory of Saint Martin. To the north across the Anguilla Channel lies the British Oversea Territory of Anguilla, to the south-east of the island lies the French island of Saint Barth√©lemy and further south are the Dutch islands of Saba and Saint Eustatius. Sint Maarten is . The terrain is generally hilly, with the highest peak being Mount Flagstaff at 383m. The area to the west around the airport is flatter, and contains the Dutch section of the Simpson Bay Lagoon. The Great Salt Pond lies to north of Philipsburg. Several small islands lie of the coast, notably Cow and Calf, Hen and Chicks, Molly Beday, Pelikan Key, Guana Key of Pelican and Sint Maarten which lies in the Simpson Bay Lagoon.  Government and politics  Map of the European Union and the UK (prior to the latter's departure) in the world with overseas countries and territories and outermost regions Sint Maarten is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and as such the Monarch of the Netherlands is head of state, represented locally by a Governor. Following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, the Constitution of Sint Maarten was unanimously adopted by the island council of Sint Maarten on 21 July 2010. Elections for a new island council were held on 17 September 2010, since the number of seats was increased from 11 to 15. The newly elected island council became the Estates of Sint Maarten on 10 October.RNW.nl - Eilandsraad Sint Maarten unaniem achter staatsregeling Sint Maarten is largely autonomous in internal affairs, with the Netherlands responsible for foreign diplomacy and defence. =Environmental Laws= The beach policy (as of 1994) views the beach from the perspective of being an ecosystem service for recreational activities. This is because the economy on Sint Maarten is tourism driven and many tourists come to the island to enjoy the 37 beaches on the island. The policy has three main points: the beach must be usable for everyone, developments that negatively affect recreative use will be prevented, and beaches should be protected against human influences that could impair their recreation function. The policy's main purpose is to protect the recreational value of the beach. The laws fail to consider the protection and ecological value of this habitat in regard to protecting nesting sea turtles, preserving the beach line, or preserving the plants that live in and along the beach line. The hillside policy, as of 1998, is mainly concerned with residential development. On the hillside, only residential development is permitted, certain hillsides with important ‚Äúvisual impact‚Äù are protected and conserved for their general landscape. A natural park is projected for the following hills: Cole Bay Hill, Sentry Hill, St. Peters Hill, Concordia Hill, Marigot Hill, Waymouth Hill and Williams Hill. The policy stated that the main objective was to conserve and maintain the green hillside and restore any natural habitats if needed. However, as of 2020, the establishment of these natural parks has to happen. =Corruption= In 1978, the government of the Netherlands Antilles installed a Research Committee on the Windward Islands () to investigate claims of corruption in the island government. Even though the report issued by this commission was damaging for the island's government, measures were not put into place to curb corruption, arguably because the government of the Netherlands Antilles depended on the support of Wathey's Democratic Party in the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles. In August 1990, the public prosecutor of the Netherlands Antilles started an investigation into the alleged ties between the island government of Sint Maarten and the Sicilian Mafia, and in 1991 the Court of Audit of the Netherlands Antilles issued a report which concluded that the island government of Sint Maarten was ailing.Oostindie and Klinkers 2001:188-189 In the government and parliament of the Netherlands, the call for measures became louder and louder. With Dutch pressure, the government of the Netherlands Antilles installed the Pourier Commission tasked with investigating the state of affairs of the island government of Sint Maarten in December 1991. Its report concluded that the island was in a severe financial crisis, that rules of democratic decision-making were continuously broken, and that the island government constituted an oligarchy. In short, the island government failed completely according to the report. After long negotiations, the Kingdom government enacted a General Measure of Kingdom Administration () in early 1993, placing Sint Maarten under direct supervision of the Kingdom. Although originally meant for one year, the Order-in-Council for the Kingdom was eventually extended until 1 March 1996.Oostindie and Klinkers 2001:189-191 Though much has changed since, allegations of criminal activities continue to plague Sint Maarten. In 2004, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles asked the Scientific Research and Documentation Centre ( (WODC)) of the Dutch Ministry of Justice to conduct research into organized crime in Sint Maarten. The report concluded that money laundering and cocaine trade are widespread on Sint Maarten. It also alleged that money from the island was used to finance Hamas, its associate Holy Land Foundation, and the Taliban.NRC.nl - Sint Maarten vrijhaven voor criminele gelden In April 2009, former Commissioner Louie Laveist was convicted, and sentenced to an 18-month prison sentence, by the Sint Maarten Court-of-First-Instance, on account of forgery, fraud, and bribery.NRC.nl - Gedeputeerde Sint Maarten veroordeeld voor corruptie He was later acquitted of forgery and of fraud by the Common Court of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, but not of bribery.The Daily Herald - Louie Laveist partially vindicated on appeal Ecology =Plants= Sint Maarten is home to many distinctive plants such as hibiscus, yellow sage (seen on the flag), flamboyant trees, mahogany, and cacti. An estimated 522 wild plants are present, mainly being seed plants and a few ferns. The Calyptranthes boldinghgii and Galactia nummelaria are ‚Äúisland-endemic‚Äù and it is suspected that they have already gone extinct. Much of the hilltops are semi-evergreen seasonal forests which are rare in region. The categorization of native, introduced, and invasive plant species is not as well documented for the island. Some of the introduced plant species include: manila grass (Zoysia matrella), Spanish bayonet ( Yucca aloifolia), Singapore almond (Terminalia catappa), true aloe (Aloe vera). Some of the native species are west Indian holly (Tunera ulmifolia), spiny amaranth (Amaranthus spinosus), bell pepper (Capsium pulcherrima), salt heliotrope (Heliotropium curassavicum), bay rum tree (pimento racemose), and sourbush (pluchea carolinesis). One of the invasive species on the island is crowfoot grass (Dactyloctenium aegyptium). = Mullet Pond = Mullet Pond, a section of the inland lagoon Simpson Bay Lagoon, is home to 70% of Sint Maarten's mangrove population on the Dutch side of the island. Mangroves are a nursery for many young fish and during hurricane season the provide coastal protection. The area, however, is at risk due to dredging, tourism activities, and the yacht industry on the island. Mullet Pond is the 55th Ramsar site since 2016 and therefore protected according to the Ramsar Treaty, a global commitment to protect ecologically significant wetland areas. =Challenges= The effects of climate change are felt on Sint Maarten. According to the Netherlands Antilles Coral Reef Initiative the coral reefs were fragmented due to a 30¬∞C temperature rise in 2005. 20 years ago, the sea grass beds were much larger. Natural disasters, like hurricanes, development, and a tourism-based industry as cause this the significantly decrease over the years. The seagrass beds are important for anchoring the sand in place as well as hurricane protection. Without the seagrass bed sand can easily be moved by a hurricane resulting in the loss of beaches or sand accumulates in one area, impacting marine life  Demographics  Catholic Church St. Martin of Tours in Philipsburg In the 2011 Netherlands Antilles census, the population of the island territory was 33,609.

Economy Many tourists come to use Sint Maarten's beaches. Sint Maarten, along with Cura√ßao, uses the Netherlands Antillean guilder as its currency. The economy is heavily dependent on tourism, either from long-stays or day-trippers from the many cruise lines that dock in the Philipsburg Harbour; around 80% of the workforce is employed in this sector. Some limited agriculture occurs, however most food is imported. In 2014, St. Maarten had more gaming machines per resident than any other country in the world. Hurricane Irma severely affected the economy in 2017. In a 2019 report, it was revealed that the island's GDP had dropped by 4.7%, with an increase in inflation. This drastic hit to the economy was due to lessened tourism, real estate, trade, and business activities.  Culture  Courthouse on Sint Maarten Sint Maarten's culture is a mix of African, European and North American influences. Ank Klomp wrote in Saint Martin: Communal Identities on a Divided Caribbean Island that Sint-Maarten lacked a Dutch cultural identity. =Festivals= An annual regatta is held over three days culminating in the first weekend in March.

The planes appear to land dangerously close to beach goers so the beach and airport have become a popular place for people to view aeroplane landings. In July 2017, a New Zealander died from head injuries after being propelled backwards from a jet engine blast. Sint Maarten is also known for its festive nightlife, expansive beaches, precious jewelry, traditional cuisines, and plentiful casinos.

The seat of the church is in Speyer, where Protestation at Speyer happened. During this historical event, German Lutheran princes protested the Reichsacht against Martin Luther and called for unhindered spread of the Protestant faith. As the Roman Catholic party urged for religious unity in the Holy Roman Empire, it dismissed all those participants who argued against an Imperial Ban on Luther as \\"Protestants\\"; it has since entered various other languages beside German language, and became a dominant term to describe churches coming out of the Reformation, as well as all these derived from them. It is the only EKD member church to formally use the word Protestant (protestantisch in German language) in its name, since most EKD member churches call themselves Evangelical (evangelisch in German language). It is a full member of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). The current President of the Church (\\"Kirchenpr√§sident\\") is Christian Schad. The Evangelical Church of the Palatinate is one of 22 Lutheran, United Protestant and Reformed churches of the EKD. As of December 2018, the regional church had 505,793 members in 431 parishes. The Evangelical Church of the Palatinate is a member of the UEK and of the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe. In Speyer, the church has its own Evangelical academy. The principal church is the Ged√§chtniskirche in Speyer. Because the church has no bishop, it is not a cathedral. History Since 1816, the Palatine Reformed and Lutheran congregations were subordinate to the Protestant church administration of the Kingdom of Bavaria, of which the then Governorate of the Palatinate formed a part. Following the parishioners' plebiscite in 1817, all Palatine Lutheran and Reformed congregations merged into confessionally united Protestant congregations. In 1848, the Palatine Protestant congregations formed a regional church, then called Vereinigte protestantisch-evangelisch-christliche Kirche der Pfalz (Pf√§lzische Landeskirche) (i.e. United Protestant Evangelical Christian Church of the Palatinate [Palatine State Church]), independent of that regional church in the rest of Bavaria. In 1922, the United Church of the Palatinate counted 506,000 parishioners.Sebastian M√ºller-Rolli in collaboration with Reiner Anselm, Evangelische Schulpolitik in Deutschland 1918‚Äì1958: Dokumente und Darstellung, G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1999, (=Eine Ver√∂ffentlichung des Comenius-Instituts M√ºnster), p. 30. . The official Palatine church body became a destroyed church () since it was taken over by Nazi-submissive German Christians, who gained a majority in the synod by the unconstitutional election imposed by Adolf Hitler on 23 July 1933. Nazi opponents then formed the Confessing Church of the Palatinate. In 1976, the Palatine church renamed into Evangelische Kirche der Pfalz (Protestantische Landeskirche) (i.e. Evangelical Church of the Palatinate [Protestant State Church]). In 1941 the commander of the CdZ-Gebiet Lothringen subjected the Protestant congregations in that occupation zone of France to the jurisdiction of the United Church of the Palatinate.Ernest Muller, \\"Maurer Charles\\", in: Dictionnaire du monde religieux dans la France contemporaine: 10 vols., Paris: Beauchesne, 1985-2001, vol. 2: 'L'Alsace' (1987), Jean-Marie Mayeur (ed.), pp. 285‚Äì287, here p. 287. .

Design  Two versions are known; a horizontal two-armed variety like a ballista and a one- armed, vertical version otherwise referred to as an onager. The fourth century army officer and historian Ammianus Marcellinus witnessed the use of scorpiones during several engagements in the Persian wars of Constantius II, and described the one-armed version as synonymous with the onager, with the vertical upraised arm as the 'scorpion's sting'. The complexity of construction and in particular the torsion springs (which the Romans referred to as tormenta) led to great sensitivity to any variation in temperature or moisture, which limited their use. While this type of technology continued to be used in the Byzantine Empire, which was the continuation of the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages, it had disappeared in the Middle Ages in Western Europe.

History and architecture The church dates from the early Norman era, being built in 1120 as the chapel to the adjoining Walmer Manor (now in ruins). The church is small, with a nave built of flint, and a roughcast lower chancel. The original Norman entrance door and chancel arch survive, along with two windows on the south side. However, the nave's north wall was removed early in the 19th century to build on an extended and deep north aisle between 1825 and 1826. This north aisle was demolished in 1898, with the building returning to its original size. The south doorway is early Norman, with large shafts and capitals in a scalloped style. The chancel arch shares many decorative motifs with the south doorway, however the inner arch has cushion-shaped capitals as well as extra moulding. The Duke of Wellington worshipped here whilst staying at Walmer Castle as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. His hatchment hangs on the north wall, which was reinstated in its original position during the 1898 north aisle demolition. Old St Mary's had previously been the only parish church in Walmer, however in the 19th century both St Saviour's and New St Mary's were built in the parish; St Mary's Church thus was retitled to Old St Mary's. Features The church possesses a plain font with a cone-shaped cover, dated to 1664. There is an indecipherable patched wall painting above the chancel arch. At the east of the chancel is stained glass depicting Our Lady and Child, dated to around 1913. Also present is stained glass from the 20th century depicting Saint Raphael and Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. A tablet monument to William L'Isle and Edmund L'Isle (both died 1637) is installed in the chancel. A large amount of 19th century tablets are also present in the nave, and a monument to Sir Henry Harvey (died 1810) is installed in the centre of the south wall. A 14th-century cusped piscina stands at the north end of the south wall of the nave.

The English victories against Wales and Ireland in the first two games meant that going into the final match they only required a draw, which they eventually achieved in a hard fought match, winning the tournament and the place in the European Championship. The Scots started badly against the unfancied Irish, losing in Belfast, and never recovered, scraping a win against Wales and needing a win against a dominant England team. The Irish were unable to capitalise on an excellent start, losing to England and Wales and coming fourth, whilst the Welsh managed a win against Ireland in their final game to scrape into joint third place after a terrible start.

His mission was to organize and coordinate operations of Te≈ükilat-ƒ± Mahsusa forces with local forces against Italian and British forces. They landed on the shore between Tobruk and Sallum on February 21, 1915 and then went to Ahmed Sharif es Senussi in Sallum.Hamit Pehlivanlƒ±, \\"Te≈ükilat-ƒ± Mahsusa Kuzey Afrika'da (1914-1918)\\", Atat√ºrk Ara≈ütƒ±rma Merkezi Dergisi, Sayƒ± 47, Cilt: XVI, Temmuz 2000. In 1917, in an attempt to organize the efforts which was dispersed by the British, the Ottoman General Staff established the ‚ÄúAfrica Groups Command‚Äù (Afrika Gruplarƒ± Komutanlƒ±ƒüƒ±), of which the primary objective was the coastal regions of Libya. Lieutenant Colonel Nuri Bey was appointed its first commander and his chief of Staff was Staff Major Abdurrahman Nafiz Bey (G√ºrman). = Caucasus = Nuri Bey's elder brother Enver Pasha, commander of the Ottoman Army, who saw an opportunity in the Caucasus after the Russian Revolution took Russia out of World War I, called back Nuri Bey from Libya. He was promoted to Mirliva Fahri (honorary) Ferik and gave the mission to form and command volunteer based the Islamic Army of the Caucasus. Nuri Bey came to Yelizavetpol (present day: Ganja) on May 25, 1918 and began to organize his forces.Ajun Kurter, T√ºrk Hava Kuvvetleri Tarihi, Cilt: IV, 3rd edition, T√ºrk Hava Kuvvetleri Komutanlƒ±ƒüƒ±, 2009, p. 92. The Army of Islam was formed officially on July 10, 1918.Liberation of the Caucasus campaign begun and fierce fightings happened between Bolshevik Baku Commune-Armenians Dashnaktsutyun and Islamic Army of the Caucasus. The Islamic Army of the Caucasus lead by Nuri Pasha took control of the whole Azerbaijan and the capital Baku in 15 September 1918.Edward J. Erickson, Order to Die: A History of the Ottoman Army in the First World War, Greenwoodpress, 2001, , p. 189. At the end of the war, Nuri was arrested by British troops and held in detention in Batum, awaiting trial for wartime crimes. In August 1919, his supporters ambushed guards escorting him and helped him escape to Erzurum.  Later life  In 1938, Killigil bought a coal mining plant in Turkey. He began to organize the production of guns, bullets, gas masks, and other war equipment. After some time, he announced the end of the production of weapons, but still secretly continued production. Killigil established contact with Franz von Papen, the Nazi ambassador in Ankara in 1941 in order to win German support for the Pan-Turkic cause. With his assistance, the Turkestan legion was formed by the Schutzstaffel. During World War II, Killigil was in Germany attempting to achieve the recognition of the independence of Azerbaijan. The attempts were unsuccessful.  Death  He was killed on 2 March 1949 by an explosion in his factory that also killed 28 other people. He was buried without a proper funeral ceremony at the time, as it was viewed as contrary to religious beliefs for dismembered corpses. A formal funeral service, to which the Azerbaijani politician Ganire Pa≈üayeva and representatives from the Municipality of Istanbul attended was only held in 2016.

G20. History Natural gas in the Hugoton area was first discovered in 1922 in the Boles #1 well, in Seward County, two miles west of Liberal. The well was drilled in 1919 to a depth of 2,919 feet by the Defenders Petroleum and Traders Oil and Gas Company, but was shut in for three years because it did not find oil. In 1922 the well was completed as a gas well, but there was little demand for natural gas in the area and it was years before another gas well was drilled in the field.Larry Skelton, \\"Hugoton's rich history,\\" AAPG Explorer, Dec. 2013, p.40-44. In 1927, gas was discovered at the Independent Oil and Gas Company's Crawford No. 1,Pippin, L., Panhandle-Hugoton Field, Texas-Oklahoma-Kansas-the First Fifty Years, in Geology of Giant Petroleum Fields, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Memoir 14, 1970, p. 206 about 2,600 feet (790 meters) below the surface southwest of Hugoton, Kansas, in Stevens County. This is now considered the center of the Hugoton Field. By the end of 1928, five wells had been drilled in the field and the first pipeline was transporting gas to local markets. In 1929, Argus Pipe Line Company started construction of a pipeline to furnish gas to Dodge City, Kansas. Construction of major pipelines in the 1930s encouraged further drilling in the area. Today, approximately 11,000 wells produce gas and oil in the Kansas portion of the Hugoton area, and thousands of miles of pipeline carry Hugoton gas to many parts of the U.S. Approximately 7,800 wells produce gas from the Chase Group in the Hugoton Field. In 2007, the Hugoton gas area produced 358 billion cubic feet of gas, making it the 5th largest source of natural gas in the United States.US Energy Information Administration, Top 100 oil and gas fields, PDF file, retrieved 18 February 2009. Helium The natural gas in the Hugoton field of Kansas and Oklahoma, plus the Panhandle Field of Texas, contains unusually high concentrations of helium, from 0.3% to 1.9%. Because of the large size of these fields, they contain the largest reserves of helium in the United States. Helium is separated out as a byproduct from natural gas, from the Hugoton field, the Panhandle field in Texas, the Greenwood field in Kansas, and the Keyes field in Oklahoma.Dwight E. Ward and Arthur P. Pierce (1973) \\"Helium\\" in United States Mineral Resources, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 820, p.285-290. Much of the recovered helium is piped to the National Helium Reserve in Amarillo, Texas, where it is stored underground in geologic formations for future use. Geology The Hugoton Field is a stratigraphic trap overlying a monocline, with the primary pay found in the Krider Dolomite of Permian age.Pippin, p. 217 This dolomite and the overlying Herington dolomite make up the Wolfcampian carbonates. Above these carbonates is the Wichita, an anhydrite and dense dolomite forming the reservoir seal, which thins to the west.Pippin, pp. 216-217, Marine carbonates were being deposited from the Late Pennsylvanian until Early Permian when the western portion of the area was uplifted which resulted in erosion and the deposition of red clays and sands, the future red beds consisting of shales and sandstones.Pippin, p. 217 Marine carbonate deposition followed, resulting in the interfingering of the red beds and carbonates, the basis of the stratigraphic trap and a tilted gas-water contact.Pippin, pp. 217-218 See also *Helium production in the United States *Index of Kansas-related articles *Lists of places in Kansas References External links *History of the Hugoton Natural Gas Area *Hugoton Asset Management Project *Kansas Geological Survey Public Information Circular about Hugoton Natural Gas Area Category:Natural history of Kansas Category:Natural gas fields in the United States Category:Geography of Seward County, Kansas Category:Geography of Stevens County, Kansas Category:Geography of Ford County, Kansas ","title":"Hugoton Gas Field"},{"id":"9529119","text":"Boston Jane: An Adventure is a 2001 children's historical novel by Jennifer L. Holm. It is followed by Boston Jane: Wilderness Days and Boston Jane: The Claim. The name is a reference to the name of the main character, Jane Peck, who is called \\"Boston Jane\\" by the Chinook. Because the first Americans associated with the Chinook were from Boston, the Chinook referred to all Americans as \\"Boston (Name)\\".  Plot summary  1855, 16-year-old Jane Peck is sailing from Philadelphia to Shoalwater Bay in Washington Territory to meet William Baldt, her betrothed. She is traveling on the poorly named ship Lady Luck, accompanied only by her Irish maid Mary, who sadly dies during a storm. Also on the ship is Father Joseph, a French Catholic priest, hoping to baptize some of the Native Americans in the area, and Jehu Scudder, a sailor from Boston. The book flashes between the current time and Jane's past in Philadelphia, which shows how she turned from a wild little girl to a quiet and pious young lady. In the flashbacks, Jane begins to attend Miss Hepplewhite's Academy for Young Ladies, where she learns \\"manners\\". While she has a hard time fitting in, eventually she excels, becoming a favorite of Miss Hepplewhite. Her widowed father, Dr. James Peck, does not take her transformation well, telling her to \\"speak your mind\\" as well as \\"there is nothing fashionable about crushed bones\\", referring to the corset which was the fashion. The flashbacks also reveal her relationship with Sally Biddle, a girl who bullied her as a child, and her relationship with William, who at the time had been studying to be a surgeon with Jane's father. When Jane arrives at Shoalwater Bay later than expected, she finds that William has left the area, believing that she had gone back on her word, and she is alone, unchaperoned. She meets and befriends Mr. Swan, a botanist studying the flora in the area, and Mr. Russell, the settler who has been there the longest. Having no home, she must house with Mr. Russell and many other \\"rough\\" men. She also meets Chinook Chief Toke, his wife Suis, and their daughter Sootie, as well as another Chinook aptly called Handsome Jim. Jane finds herself useless, her training at the academy insufficient for the harsh living of the Washington Territory. She does not know how to cook and so is made to mend the shirts of Mr. Russell, and as she soon finds out, every other man in the area (this is because \\"all the boys\\" have been putting their shirts in her mending pile). Jane soon learns how to cook, using the book her maid Mary left behind, which is filled with recipes from her childhood, including her favorite, cherry pie, which Jane changes to salmonberry pie, having no cherries to use. Jane has many other adventures, including fruitlessly diving into the water to find Mr. Swan's canoe, which has been lost in a storm, then replacing it by trading much of her wedding trousseau with Suis, with whom she has built a steady relationship. Mr. Swan then accepts her into his oyster business, and she names the new canoe The Brandywine after Mr. Russell's dog. Jane also attends the affair of the year, the Fourth of July party, where she once again runs into Jehu. After they dance together, he kisses her, admitting that he loves her. Despite feeling an attraction to him, Jane turns him away and runs off, falling off a cliff. She recovers, but Jehu leaves soon after. Chief Toke, Mr. Russell, and Mr. Swan leave for Astoria, leaving Jane with the Chinooks and Father Joseph. However, soon the Chinooks develop smallpox. Jane and Father Joseph, both of whom have been vaccinated, attempt to save them, but many of them die, including Jane's friend Suis. Without hesitation, Jane dresses her in her wedding dress, assured that Suis would be the most beautiful woman in heaven. Handsome Jim, though not physically scarred, is mentally scarred, no longer a carefree young man, and he renames himself Keer- usko meaning Crooked-nose. The men return from Astoria, along with William, who is not at all overjoyed to see that his fiance has now become as wild as before. Keer-usko tells Jane he dislikes her fiance, saying that he is like a mouse or a flea, and though Jane protests, she too has her doubts, refusing to kiss him goodnight. Jane soon finds out that William only wanted to marry her for the land, since married men received more land then single ones. It is also revealed that William has already married a half-Makah half-white girl, but that he is ready to leave her for Jane. Jane, realizing that he never loved her and that in truth she never loved him, breaks the engagement, and William leaves. Jane decides to return to Philadelphia but changes her mind as she sees Jehu striding towards her. She is no longer Miss Jane Peck of Philadelphia, but Boston Jane of Shoalwater Bay.

The school has been a member of IBO since 1993. The school's curriculum is based mostly on the US curriculum, however religion and Arabic classes are provided due to the Ministry of Education's requirement. The school has a review in the Good Schools Guide International, which states, \\"The school has a relaxed yet purposeful air to it throughout,\\" adding, \\"Given that a majority of the students do not speak English as a first language, they do reasonably well.\\" History and programs The American International School of Kuwait was founded by Dr. Kamil Al-Rayyes, on September 4, 1991. It first opened in Surra, but in 1995, it moved to its current location in Salmiya, block 11, known as Maidan Hawalli. During the summer of 2004, AIS officially became an MYP school. The MYP system is for grades 5-10. After becoming an MYP school, many changes started to form. In 2005, AIS became an authorized Primary Years Programme (PYP) school. The school is fully accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The school is also a member of the Near East South Asia Council of Overseas Schools (NESA). The American International School of Kuwait has been an International Baccalaureate World School since September 1993. It offers the IB Primary Years Programme, IB Middle Years Programme and IB Diploma Programme (DP). Currently, AIS educates 1700 students. The school is the only fully authorized (kindergarten through grade 12) IBO World School in Kuwait (the only other school in Kuwait offering any type of International Baccalaureate is the American Creativity Academy; however, they only offer it at high school level). There are several thousand schools worldwide that offer the IB Diploma, but fewer than 200 offer the IB programmes from kindergarten through high school. AIS Kuwait has been authorized by the IBO to offer the Middle Years Programme (Grades 6 through 10) since 2004 and the Primary Years Programme (KG through Grade 5) since 2005. Campus, classes and activities The American International School of Kuwait has undergone many changes over the years, the most noticeable being those made to campus. A state of the art theater style auditorium was built and it has a capacity of about 1,000 people. Many new classrooms were built and existing facilities, such as the bathrooms, were remodeled. The school sees continual improvements to the campus and has gone through major renovations each summer. In 2004, the new Kamil Al Rayes Theater was built. By 2005, the canteen was rebuilt, and the gym was replaced completely. The school offers a wide range of classes, such as Math, English, History, Science, Individuals & Societies, Arabic, French, Drama, Fine Arts, Band and Design. All classes are taught by teachers who are mostly Canadian or American, though there are some other nationalities. The IB diploma is offered, as well as the PYP and MYP programs implemented. AIS has Under-14 teams, Junior Varsity, and Varsity teams for several sports. The sports teams participate and sometimes host a national competition between other schools in Kuwait called KSAA (Kuwait Schools Activities Association). AIS used to be a part of a regional competition known as EMAC. As EMAC folded in 2011, AIS was involved in ISAC but in 2014 began participating in NESAC (Near East Schools Activities Conference) instead. Students Approximately one half of AIS students are Kuwaiti. Twenty-five percent are also Arabic nationals from other countries, and the remaining quarter are non-Arabs. Students of all nationalities study Arabic, either as a first (for Arab nationals) or foreign language (non-Arab nationals), as required by the Kuwait Ministry of Education. Muslim students, regardless of nationality, are also required by the Kuwait Ministry of Education to study religion.  School uniform  The school uniform for the grades K-11 consists of a white shirt with the AIS logo on it and navy blue pants, skirt or dress, and as of recently, an ID tag. The uniform must be purchased through the school, from an on-campus store, however the ID tag is given complimentary to students, but purchasing a custom lanyard is acceptable. Uniform regulations restrict girls to wearing skirts that cover their knees. Boys are only allowed to wear pants. Although the regular school shirt is white, seniors and KG-1 students are allowed to wear red shirts as well. Every year the administration allows the seniors to create their own senior shirts as an effort to make the seniors feel more special.  University admissions  Graduates of AIS Kuwait attend English language universities around the world including Harvard, MIT, Yale, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, UC Berkeley, Cornell, McGill and the University of Toronto. Roughly half of the approximately 120 graduates attend universities within Kuwait and the Middle Eastern region. The other half begin university abroad with the majority attending American schools. The graduating class of 2011, according to information provided at the graduation, received acceptances in more than seventy North American universities.

Built mainly in the 15th century in Brabantine Gothic style, the church has a cruciform floor plan and a low bell tower that has never been completed. It is long. History The first church on the site, made of wood and presumably founded in 986, burned down in 1176.The Great Market Square, Leuven city website (archived 4 December 2008) It was replaced by a Romanesque church, made of stone, featuring a West End flanked by two round towers like at Our Lady's Basilica in Maastricht. Of the Romanesque building only part of the crypt remains, underneath the chancel of the actual church. Construction of the present Gothic edifice, significantly larger than its predecessor, was begun approximately in 1425, and was continued for more than half a century in a remarkably uniform style, replacing the older church progressively from east (chancel) to west. Its construction period overlapped with that of the Town Hall across the Markt, and in the earlier decades of construction shared the same succession of architects as its civic neighbor: Sulpitius van Vorst to start with, followed by Jan II Keldermans and later on Matheus de Layens. In 1497 the building was practically complete, although modifications, especially at the West End, continued. =Towers= Saint Peter's Church, as seen from Rector De Somerplein In 1458, a fire struck the old Romanesque towers that still flanked the West End of the uncompleted building. The first arrangements for a new tower complex followed quickly, but were never realized. Then, in 1505, Joost Matsys (brother of painter Quentin Matsys) forged an ambitious plan to erect three colossal towers of freestone surmounted by openwork spires, which would have had a grand effect, as the central spire would rise up to about 170 m, 550 jaar Stadhuis Leuven making it the world's tallest structure at the time. Insufficient ground stability and funds proved this plan impracticable, as the central tower reached less than a third of its intended height before the project was abandoned in 1541. After the height was further reduced by partial collapses from 1570 to 1604, the main tower now rises barely above the church roof; at its sides are mere stubs. The architect had, however, made a maquette of the original design, which is preserved in the southern transept. Despite their incomplete status, the towers are mentioned on the UNESCO World Heritage List, as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France. =War and after war= The church suffered severe damage in both World Wars. In 1914 a fire caused the collapse of the roof and in 1944 a bomb destroyed part of the northern side. The reconstructed roof is surmounted at the crossing by a fl√®che, which, unlike the 18th-century cupola that preceded it, blends stylistically with the rest of the church. A very late (1998) addition is the jacquemart, or golden automaton, which periodically rings a bell near the clock on the gable of the southern transept, above the main southern entrance door. Artworks and relics Interior of the St. Peter's Church, Leuven by Wolfgang de Smet, 1667 Despite the devastation during the World Wars, the church remains rich in works of art. The chancel and ambulatory were turned into a museum in 1998, where visitors can view a collection of sculptures, paintings and metalwork. The church has two paintings by the great Flemish painter Dirk Bouts on display, the Last Supper (1464-1468) and The Martyrdom of St Erasmus (1465). The Nazis seized The Last Supper in 1942. Panels from the painting had been sold legitimately to German museums in the 1800s, and Germany was forced to return all the panels as part of the required reparations of the Versailles Treaty after World War I. = Exterior = Leuven 42127 Sint-Pieterskerk DSC 3232.JPGUnfinished tower 20091017 leuven stpierre04.JPGChoir & ridge St- Pieter Leuven zuidkant.jpgTransepts Leuven 42127 Sint-Pieterskerk DSC 3423.JPGGothic windows = Interior/General = In side chapels are the tombs of Duke Henry I of Brabant (d. 1235), his wife Matilda (d. 1211) and their daughter Marie (d. 1260).

The population was 7,970 at the 2010 census. The city is part of the Metro Lakeland area. The mayor of Murphysboro is Will Stephens. The government consists of the mayor and 10 city aldermen. Geography Murphysboro is located at (37.767245, -89.337346). According to the 2010 census, Murphysboro has a total area of , of which (or 98.38%) is land and (or 1.62%) is water. Murphysboro is located southeast of Kinkaid Lake. Although Murphysboro is only 10 miles east of the Mississippi River, the nearest access point to the river is in Grand Tower, a roughly 30 minute drive southwest. As part of the humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa), Murphysboro can grow a small number of cold hardy palm trees that can live year-round, and can be found sparingly around the municipality. A palm tree growing in Murphysboro History Established in September 1843, Murphysboro is the second county seat of Jackson County. Its birth is tied to the disastrous fire that destroyed the courthouse in the first county seat, Brownsville. The fire proved to be the catalyst to move the county seat to a more central location. The name was decided for the new town when William C. Murphy's name was drawn from a hat containing the names of the three commissioners who chose the new location, a tract of land donated by Dr. John Logan and Elizabeth Logan. The son of the site's donors, Major General John A. Logan, later became a volunteer general in the Civil War. General Logan is also remembered for a distinguished political career, serving as Illinois‚Äô US Senator from 1871-1877 and 1880‚Äì1886, as well as for running for Vice President in 1884. At the time of his death he was considered a presidential hopeful. Logan's greatest legacy, however, is his creation of Memorial Day as a national holiday. The economy of Murphysboro was based on coal for many of its growing years. It was also important in industry and transportation.

Murphysboro's General John A.
