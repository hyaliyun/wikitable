Its operations include Jewish-inspired after-school programs such as \\"Latte and Learnings\\"; summer programs in Israel, Europe, and the United States; weekend programming such as FNL (Friday Night Lights), shabbatons, retreats, and regionals; Israel advocacy training; and disaster relief missions known as chesed (kindness) trips.NCSY Background, Orthodox Union, 2000 NCSY also has an alumni department focused on empowering its alumni on campuses across North America to be able to live with a Jewish identity on college campuses. Over the past several decades, NCSY has been the subject of two child sexual abuse scandals involving chapter advisors and directors. NCSY, and its parent organization, the OU, have taken significant steps to address such abuse from an organizational standpoint.  History  NCSY is the organizational successor to the National Union of Orthodox Jewish Youth, established in 1942 as an Orthodox youth movement similar to a synagogue men's club or sisterhood.Etan Diamond, And I Will Dwell in Their Midst: Orthodox Jews in Suburbia (University of North Carolina Press, 2000 Over time, its emphasis moved to providing positive religious experiences to adolescents. Though outreach to public school youth has been around since the early Young Israel movement, NCSY's most relevant precursor is the Torah Leadership Seminar, created in 1954 by the Division of Communal Services of Yeshiva University under Dr Abraham Stern, which developed the Shabbaton model. There was a core of NCSY from two early founded regions Midwest Region (founded 1951) and Southern Region (founded in 1952 by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Rosenberg and Mr. Abe Rabhan of B'nai B'rith Jacob synagogue in Savannah, Georgia). In 1954, Harold and Enid Boxer donated the money to create a national organization from the already- existing Southern and Midwest Regions. In 1959, NCSY hired Rabbi Pinchas Stolper as the first National Director. In the 1960s there was an emphasis on NCSY Publications with many volumes written by Pinchas Stolper and then later the Aryeh Kaplan Series. They also put out the NCSY Guide to Blessings and the NCSY Bencher. In 1962, NCSY received outstanding praise from Rabbi Meir Kahane, after his having participated as an advisor to the NCSY annual convention. During the social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s, the Orthodox youth of NCSY strove to temper social change through religious tradition. In this period, at least one NCSY chapter took public action on this point, passing a resolution rejecting marijuana and other drugs as a violation of Jewish law. At the 1971 NCSY international convention, delegates passed resolutions in this vein, calling for members to \\"forge a social revolution with Torah principles.\\" In the mid-1970s, NCSY started a boys camp at Ner Israel Rabbinical College in Baltimore, MD. It was originally known as \\"NCSY Goes to Yeshiva,\\" and later changed its name to \\"Camp NCSY Sports\\". In 1970, the Israel Summer Institute for Jewish teens was founded. Rabbi Stolper assisted NCSY in expanding internationally into Canada, Israel, Australia, Chile, and Ukraine. By 2015, NCSY Summer Programs included The Anne Samson Jerusalem (TJJ), NCSY Kollel, NCSY Michlelet, NCSY GIVE (Girls Israel Volunteer Experience), NCSY JOLT (Jewish Overseas Leadership Training), NCSY BILT (Boys Israel Leadership Training), and other summer programs. There were 1097 participants in NCSY Summer in 2015. The organization has produced many Jewish children's entertainers who have remained in outreach work, including Uncle Moishy and the Mitzvah Men and Zale Newman. According to the Orthodox sociologist Chaim Waxman, there has been an increase in Haredi influence on NCSY. Waxman based this on NCSY's own sociological self-study.Nathalie Friedman, Faithful Youth: A Study of the National Conference of Synagogue Youth (New York: National Conference of Synagogue Youth, 1998). David Bashevkin is currently the NCSY director of education.Bashevkin, Dovid. \\"Jonah and the Varieties of Religious Motivation.\\" Lehrhaus. 9 October 2016. 2 October 2017. Organization The organization possesses an International Director within the Orthodox Union, and is subdivided into national, regional and local chapters. NCSY is divided into geographic regions throughout North America. They are New England, Upper New York, New York-Long Island, New Jersey, Atlantic Seaboard, Central East, Southern, South Florida, Greater Midwest, Southwest, West Coast, Northwest, and Canada. Additionally, NCSY runs programming branches in Israel and now Chile and Argentina. Each Region is divided into chapters. A chapter is typically a city, or a group of surrounding towns. In heavily populated Jewish areas like New Jersey, counties may have several chapters. Many chapters in NCSY appoint or elect a group of NCSYers to serve on a chapter board, who work with the advisors or city directors to assist with programming or outreach. Many regions do the same thing, and have a regional board, who do similar things for the region. The International Board consists of representatives from many different regions. NCSY's programming is divided into two age groups, \\"junior\\" and \\"senior\\"; these generally encompass 5th‚Äì8th grades and 9th‚Äì12th grades, respectively. Some programs span both age groups, but most programming is unique for each. Programming NCSY's original model was to create the regional Shabbaton, a weekend-long social and educational Shabbat experience based on learning sessions, following in the model of Abraham Stern of Torah Leadership Seminar. Currently, while on Shabbatons kids are treated to skits, learning sessions and ebbing, where participants sit in a circle around the \\"circle guy\\" where they sing songs and do \\"funny\\" routines. They are housed either in hotels, camps, or grouped with sponsor families who take them in for the weekend.  NCSY Summer  NCSY Summer runs 18 different trips to Israel, Europe, and North America. The trips have fluctuated every year, with new programs released and other programs cut. Boys Trips: * Camp Sports - \\"Camp Sports enables participants to hone their athletic skills while learning Torah with their friends and advisors in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.

Allegations  Baruch Lanner is a former director of NCSY convicted for sexual misconduct with minors whom he had contact with through the organization. The investigation began on July 12, 2000, he was indicted in March of that same year and surrendered to authorities and entered a plea of \\"not-guilty\\" on April 20, 2000. Lanner was convicted on one account of fondling a student on June 27 of 2002. Baruch Lanner was hired by NCSY's founder Pinchas Stolper in 1970 , and remained his superior until 1994. Lanner was already threatened with suspension for sexual contact with two teenage girls in 1972. At the time, in 2000 one journalist, Gary Rosenblatt of The Jewish Week argued that the Orthodox community had failed to deal with Lanner properly, and argued that NCSY workers often put the ends above means, sometimes with insufficient regard to the family dynamic or the alienation of teens from their parents. It also sometimes tends to a charismatic quality.The Dark Side of Outreach: Does NCSY value religious observance over family harmony? Reassessing the culture of charismatic kiruv. Rosenblatt, Gary The Jewish Week 08-04-2000 In response the Orthodox Union set up a special commission of investigation. A 54-page public report summarizing a much longer document of investigation, found the following. > The report cited \\"profound errors of judgment\\" in the way OU leaders dealt > with Lanner and also noted a larger problem of \\"poor management practices\\" > in the OU, including a lack of accountability by professionals to volunteer > leadership, lack of involvement by lay leaders in matters of governance, > lack of financial controls and a \\"total absence of any policies regarding > basic ethical issues\\" in both the OU and NCSY. As a result of the Lanner scandal, NCSY conducted a thoroughgoing internal review and reformed its structures and running. It created conduct standards, and published a manual on behavior. NCSY has also established an ombudsman hotline. Menachem Chinn is the former leader of the Twin Rivers chapter of NCSY who was convicted of molesting two children under his supervision. Having taught at Shalom Torah Academy in East Windsor and Morgansville, New Jersey, Chinn was first arrested on April 20, 2017 after a former student of his accused him of molesting him in Chinn's home. A week following the initial arrest, a second accuser came forward, revealing that he, also a former student of Chinn, had been repeatedly molested throughout his education at Shalom Torah Academy. Menachem Chinn admitted to both instances of rape and pleaded guilty, thereby serving only a suspended 5-year sentence of prison time.  Lawsuit  In October 2011, NCSY was sued by a former advisor and employee for violation of the US Fair Labor Standards Act. The class action lawsuit claims that she had to work much longer hours than the allowed 40-hour work week.

History =Development= The M 14/41 was a slightly improved version of the earlier M 13/40 with a more powerful diesel engine. It was produced in limited numbers as it was already considered obsolete by the time of its introduction. The M 14/41 used the same chassis as the M13/40 but with a redesigned hull with better armour. The M 14/41 was manufactured in 1941 and 1942. Nearly 800 had been produced by the time production ended. =In combat= Italian M 14/41 tanks in depot, September 1943. The tank was first employed in the North African Campaign where its shortcomings quickly became apparent. The vehicle was unreliable and cramped, and caught fire easily when hit. Following the withdrawal of Italian forces from North Africa the M14/41 was rarely encountered, though many captured vehicles were pressed into service by British and Australian forces to fill the serious shortage of Allied tanks in 1941. These vehicles did not remain in Allied service for long.  Units  The first unit to receive the M14/41 was the X Tank Battalion \\"M\\" of the 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment.

Beamon advanced quickly through the minors, and after he batted .334 in 1995 as a 21-year-old with the Calgary Cannons of the AAA Pacific Coast League, Baseball America honored him as the organization's top prospect. Beamon struggled to establish himself on the MLB, however. He appeared in 24 games with the Pirates in 1996 before being traded, with Angelo Encarnaci√≥n to the San Diego Padres, in exchange for Mark Smith and Hal Garrett. He appeared in 43 games with the Padres the next year before being traded again; the Padres sent Beamon and Tim Worrell to the Detroit Tigers, receiving Dan Miceli, Donne Wall, and Ryan Balfe in return. Beamon appeared in 28 games with the Tigers in 1998, his final season in the major leagues. For his career, he compiled a .253 batting average, a .306 on-base percentage, and a .310 slugging percentage in 158 at bats.

The route traverses Fish Lake Valley, which is part in California and part in Nevada. The route connects two Nevada state routes that traverse the Nevada portion of the valley, NV 264 and NV 266. The only connection from SR 266 to the rest of California's road network is via SR 168 in the community of Oasis. Prior to 1986 the southern and northern halves of modern SR 266 had separate numerical designations. The southern portion of the highway, along with modern SR 168, dates to the auto trail era, forming part of the Midland Trail. Route description Southern terminus of SR 266 at the Nevada state line. The \\"Welcome to Nevada\\" sign can be seen in the background. State Route 266 begins at the western terminus of Nevada State Route 266 at the Nevada state line. The route travels west-northwest, then turns to the west for another before approaching Oasis, the only community that the route passes through. At Oasis, SR 266 intersects SR 168, which serves as the gateway into the Owens Valley from Nevada. Upon leaving Oasis, SR 266 continues to the west briefly, then turns north-northwest. Within the last , SR 266 slowly curves northwest as the route approaches the Nevada state line. The route ends at the state line at the southern terminus of Nevada State Route 264. As the route has more connections to Nevada than the rest of California, Caltrans and the Nevada DOT have entered into a joint agreement on snow removal and other short term maintenance duties for the route. The section of SR 266 from the western terminus to the junction with SR 168 is designated by the California State Legislature as eligible by law for the State Scenic Highway System; but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The entire route, consisting of two lanes for two-way traffic, traverses on the flat land in the Fish Lake Valley east of the White Mountains, and it can serve as transportation of agricultural goods between California and Nevada via the route's only junction State Route 168. In the event that SR 168 is closed, SR 266 connects to Nevada State Route 264, which intersects with U.S. Route 6 in order to provide an alternate access to California. History The southern half of modern SR 266 (from Oasis to Nevada State Route 266 near Lida, Nevada) predates the era of numbered highways and formed part of the Midland Trail, one of the first auto trails crossing the entire country. Construction for a road from Oasis to the Nevada state line to be added to the State Highway System was authorized in 1931. This road was initially designated Legislative Route 63 and later signed as California State Route 168. In 1965, route 266 was designated incorporating what is the northern half of modern SR 266 connecting with modern Nevada State Route 264, using the alignment of an existing Mono County road. In 1986, the definition of SR 266 was extended to its modern form, with both termini at the Nevada state line, absorbing what was previously a portion of SR 168. With this change Nevada and California routes 266 connected at the state line.

He is approached by a Haganah agent, Major Safir, who requests his assistance in preparing Israeli troops to defend the newly declared State against an invasion by its Arab neighbors. Marcus is refused permission by the Pentagon to go, unless he travels as a civilian. The Haganah gives him a false passport with the alias \\"Michael Stone\\". As \\"Michael Stone\\", he arrives in Israel to be met by a Haganah member, Magda Simon. Marcus, who parachuted into occupied France during World War II and helped to organize the relief mission for one of the first Nazi concentration camps liberated by American troops, is initially viewed with suspicion by some Haganah soldiers. But after he leads a commando raid on an Arab arms dump and assists in a landing of illegal refugees, he is more accepted. After preparing training manuals for the troops, he returns to New York, where his wife has suffered a miscarriage. Now, restless and, despite his wife's pleadings, he does return to Israel and is given command of the Jerusalem front with the rank of 'Aluf' (General), a rank not used since biblical days. He sets to work, recognising that, while the men under his command do not have proper training or weapons or even a system of ranks, they do have spirit and determination. He organises the construction of the \\"Burma Road\\", bypassing Latrun, to enable convoys to reach besieged Jerusalem, where the population is on the verge of starvation. Many of the soldiers under his command are newly arrived in Israel, determined and enthusiastic but untrained. Dubbing them 'the schnooks', Marcus is inspired by them to discover that he is proud to be a Jew. But, just before the convoy of trucks to Jerusalem starts out, he is shot and killed by a lone sentry who does not speak English - the last casualty before the United Nations impose a truce. The coffin containing his body is carried by an honor guard of the soldiers he trained and inspired.

Production Writer and producer Mel Shavelson acquired the film for $12,500 after it was dropped by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. Shavelson told The New York Times that production of the film was initially hampered by the film industry's reluctance to deal with Jewish subjects, as well as fear that theaters in Egypt might be expropriated. The Times also reported a lingering \\"pogrom mentality\\" among some Jewish executives, who did not wish to draw attention to the Jewish background of many in the film industry. Shavelson enlisted the support of John Wayne, and with his help it was financed and distributed by United Artists. Reception The New York Times criticized the film, specifically the directing, calling it a \\"confusing, often superficial biography that leans a good deal on comic or extremely salty dialogues and effects.\\" The reviewer said that In trying to fuse the many aspects of Marcus' life \\"into a titanic figure, what evolves, sadly, is an amalgam of all manufactured movie heroes.\\" It received a poor reception at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, where critics called the film \\"one more war feature with not much technical value.\\" A reviewer at the Louisville Courier-Journal called it \\"a phony and a noisy bore\\" featuring \\"the sorriest of film cliches, and the hollowest of romantic clap-trap.\\" The New York Daily News gave the film four stars and called it a \\"rousing adventure picture\\" and a \\"drama of historical significance and of human interest.\\" In 2006, Andrew Wolf from the New York Sun praised the filmmakers for the pro-Jewishness of the film, something he believes could not be done in modern Hollywood. However he referred to it as an \\"awful film,\\" from a technical standpoint and heavily criticized the fictitious love interest subplot. It was released on DVD in early 2000s but went out of print. It was rereleased on DVD, and the 1st time on Blu-ray August 26, 2014. Giving it a mild recommendation, DVD Talk said \\"the cast does work that is better than the script they've been provided.\\"https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/64914/cast-a-giant-shadow-blu- ray-1966/ See also *List of American films of 1966 *John Wayne filmography References Further reading *Shavelson, Melville.

Life Curnow was born in Timaru, New Zealand, the son of a fourth generation New Zealander, an Anglican clergyman, and he grew up in a religious family. The family was of Cornish origin.White, G. Pawley, A Handbook of Cornish Surnames.(Curnow is himself mentioned by Rowse) During his early childhood they often moved, living in Canterbury, Belfast, Malvern, Lyttelton and New Brighton. He was educated at Christchurch Boys' High School, Canterbury University, and Auckland University. After completing his education, Curnow worked from 1929 to 1930 at the Christchurch Sun, before moving once again to Auckland to prepare for the Anglican ministry at St John's Theological College (1931‚Äì1933). In this period Curnow also published his first poems in University periodicals, such as Kiwi and Phoenix. In 1934 Curnow returned to the South Island, where he started a correspondence with Iris Wilkinson and Alan Mulgan, as well as finding a job at The Press, the Christchurch morning daily newspaper, having decided against a career in the Anglican ministry. At the same time, he also started a lifelong friendship with Denis Glover and contributed to the Caxton Press, submitting some of his poems. He then taught English at Auckland University from 1950 to 1976. Personal life Curnow's first marriage, to Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Le Cren, was dissolved in 1965; they had a daughter and two sons, one of whom is New Zealand poet and art critic Wystan Curnow. His second marriage was to Jennifer Tole. Career Curnow wrote a long-running weekly satirical poetry column under the pen-name of Whim Wham for The Press from 1937, and then the New Zealand Herald from 1951, finishing in 1988 - a far-reaching period in which he turned his keen wit to many world issues, from Franco, Hitler, Vietnam, Apartheid, and the White Australia policy, to the internal politics of Walter Nash and the eras of Rob Muldoon and David Lange, all interspersed with humorous commentary on New Zealand's obsession with rugby and other light- hearted subjects. Curnow's publication Book of New Zealand Verse (1945) is seen as a landmark in New Zealand literature. He is, however, more celebrated as poet than as a satirist. His poetic works are heavily influenced by his training for the Anglican ministry, and subsequent rejection of that calling, with Christian imagery, myth and symbolism being included frequently, particularly in his early works (such as 'Valley of Decision'). He draws consistently on his experiences in childhood to shape a number of his poems, reflecting perhaps a childlike engagement with the environment in which he grew up, these poems bringing the hopeful, curious, questioning voice that a childlike view entails. Curnow's work of course is not all so innocently reflective. The satirist in Curnow is certainly not pushed aside in his poetic works, but is explored instead with a greater degree of emotional connectivity and self-reflection. Curnow's works concerning the New Zealand landscape and the sense of isolation experienced by one who lives in an island colony are perhaps his most moving and most deeply pertinent works regarding the New Zealand condition. His landscape/isolation centered poetry reflects varying degrees of engaged fear, guilt, accusation, rage and possessiveness, creating an important but, both previously and still, much neglected dialogue with the New Zealand landscape. He positions himself as an outside critic (he was far less religiously and politically involved than contemporaries like James K. Baxter, and far more conventional in his lifestyle also) and though perhaps less impassioned in his writing than his contemporaries, his poetic works are both prophetic and intelligent. =Honours and awards= *In the 1986 Queen's Birthday Honours, Curnow was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to literature. *Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry, 1989 *On 6 February 1990, Curnow was the fourteenth appointee to The Order of New Zealand.\\"Honours and Awards\\" (15 February 1990) 23 New Zealand Gazette 445 at 446. *New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal *New Zealand Book Award for Poetry; 1958, 1963, 1975, 1980, 1983, 1987, 2001 *Commonwealth Poetry Prize 1988 (for Continuum) *Cholmondeley Award, 1992 (other winners that year: Donald Davie, Carol Ann Duffy, and Roger Woddis) *A W Reed Lifetime Achievement Award, 2000 =Bibliography= * 1933: Valley of Decision : Poems.

D. Eichel (formerly Steve Dubrow-Eichel) is a psychologist known primarily for his work on destructive cults, coercive persuasion, mind control, brainwashing, and deprogramming. He is a former President of the Greater Philadelphia Society of Clinical Hypnosis and the 2006-07 President of the American Academy of Counseling Psychology, the national membership academy comprising American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP) Board-certified counseling psychologists. In 2012 he was installed as the President of the Board of the International Cultic Studies Association. Eichel graduated with his Ph.D. in 1989, from the University of Pennsylvania. He has performed research with fellow psychologist Linda Dubrow in the area of procrastination. Dubrow and Eichel studied cult characteristics of the group Al-Qaeda after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Eichel was an expert witness in the 2003 case of Lee Boyd Malvo, where he testified that Malvo suffered from a form of dissociative disorder caused by coercive persuasion. He has worked to expose fraudulent practices of credentialing organizations, by obtaining numerous certifications for his pet cat, Zoe, including the National Guild of Hypnotists, the American Board of Hypnotherapy and the International Medical & Dental Hypnotherapy Association. Eichel has practiced clinical psychology in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Newark, Delaware. He has lectured on the subject of cults, brainwashing, and terrorism. Early life and family Eichel is the child of survivors of the Holocaust; his parents spent time in Nazi concentration camps. His parents only recounted to him, \\"anecdotes here and there\\"; Eichel explained to The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"Most of what I thought I knew about their experiences was my own fantasy that filled in the enormous gaps.\\" Education Eichel received a B.A. degree from Columbia University, and M.S. from University of Pennsylvania. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1989, at University of Pennsylvania. Eichel is a Board Certified Diplomate in Counseling Psychology, American Board of Professional Psychology. Research In 1988, with fellow psychologist Linda Dubrow Eichel, he performed research in the area of procrastination. During the Persian Gulf war, Eichel said that images from the conflict affected his teenage clients, \\"Those two things really hit my teenage patients hard.\\" He said that bad dreams about the battles were, \\"little red lights, saying it's time to step back, think about yourself, think about your life, talk to other people, gather information, connect with people who are important to you. It is a warning sign that you should not go on with life as usual.\\" He commented to The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2000 on the subject of the controversial religious group, the evangelical International Church of Christ; that the methodology behind the group \\"is that you give yourself over to the person who acts as your 'shepherd' or discipler, and they get tremendous control over you. ... Every minute [of your life] must be Christ-centered, and that when you give yourself over to Jesus, you give yourself over to the ICC.\\" In 2000, Eichel said he had counseled approximately six former members of the group in his psychotherapy practice. Linda Dubrow and Eichel worked together at the organization Re-Entry Therapy, Information and Referral Network (RETIRN). With Dubrow, Eichel has researched media coverage regarding September 11, 2001, and has determined that the group Al-Qaeda is a cult. With Michael Langone and Arthur Dole, Eichel performed a series of studies researching and defining the concept of \\"new age\\"; their research was published in the Cultic Studies Journal. Eichel was an expert witness in the 2003 criminal trial of Lee Boyd Malvo; in addition to psychologists Dewey Cornell and Diane Schetky, and psychiatrist Neil Blumberg. Eichel testified that Malvo suffered from a form of dissociative disorder, caused by coercive persuasion. Eichel exposed the nature of the mail-order-credentialing of organizations in the United States by obtaining board certification from the \\"American Psychotherapy Association\\" for his pet cat, Zoe. The Washington Post reported in 2002: \\"Zoe has been issued credentials by the National Guild of Hypnotists, the American Board of Hypnotherapy and the International Medical & Dental Hypnotherapy Association, and is a Professional Member of the American Association of Professional Hypnotherapists.\\" Eichel commented to BBC News regarding the motivation for this endeavor, \\"I felt I'd test my hypothesis and I did that by getting my cat certified by a number of the most prominent lay hypnosis organisations in the United States. It was a frighteningly simple process.\\" The certifications were obtained for his cat, under the full name, \\"Dr. Zoe D. Katz\\". Eichel utilizes hypnosis in his practice of psychotherapy. In 2003, Eichel practiced psychology in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and treated victims of sex addiction. He practiced within the arena of clinical psychology.

It is a colorless liquid with a pungent smell and taste that is soluble in most organic solvents. Like other low molecular weight organic peroxides, it is unstable and prone to explosion when heated or treated with organic acids. Ascaridole determines the specific flavor of the Chilean tree boldo and is a major constituent of the oil of Mexican tea (wormseed). It is a component of natural medicine, tonic drinks and food flavoring in Latin American cuisine. As part of the oil, ascaridole is used as an anthelmintic drug that expels parasitic worms from plants, domestic animals and the human body. History Ascaridole was the first, and for a long time only, discovered naturally occurring organic peroxide. It was isolated from Chenopodium oil and named by H√ºthig in 1908, who described its explosive character and determined its chemical formula as C10H16O2. Ascaridole is discussed in the section titled \\"Wormseed oil, American\\", pp. 109‚Äì119. Ascaridole is named on p. 111; its empirical formula is stated on p. 114; its explosive character is mentioned on p. 115. H√ºthig also noted the indifference of ascaridole to aldehydes, ketones or phenols that characterized it as non-alcohol. When reacted with sulfuric acid, or reduced with zinc powder and acetic acid, ascaridole formed cymene.(H√ºthig, April 1908), p. 116. These results were confirmed in a detailed study by E. K. Nelson in 1911, in particular that ascaridole explodes upon heating, reacting with sulfuric, hydrochloric, nitric, or phosphoric acids. Nelson showed that the new substance contained neither a hydroxyl nor a carbonyl group and that upon reduction with iron(II) sulfate it formed a glycol, now known as ascaridole glycol, C10H18O3. The glycol is more stable than ascaridole and has a higher melting point of about 64 ¬∞C, boiling point of 272 ¬∞C, and density of 1.098 g/cm3. Nelson also predicted the chemical structure of ascaridole which was almost correct, but had the peroxide bridge not along the molecular axis, but between the other, off-axis carbon atoms. See p. 1412. This structure was corrected by Otto Wallach in 1912. The first laboratory synthesis was demonstrated in 1944 by G√ºnther Schenck and Karl Ziegler and might be regarded as mimicking the natural production of ascaridole. The process starts from Œ±-terpinene which reacts with oxygen under the influence of chlorophyll and light. Under these conditions singlet oxygen is generated which reacts in a Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction with the diene system in the terpinene. Since 1945, this reaction has been adopted into the industry for large-scale production of ascaridole in Germany. It was then used as an inexpensive drug against intestinal worms. Properties Ascaridole is a colorless liquid that is soluble in most organic solvents. It is toxic and has a pungent, unpleasant smell and taste. Like other pure, low molecular weight organic peroxides, it is unstable and prone to explosion when heated to a temperature above 130 ¬∞C or treated with organic acids. When heated, it emits fumes which are poisonous and possibly carcinogenic. Ascaridole (organic peroxide) is forbidden to be shipped as listed in the US Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials Table 49 CFR 172.101. Occurrence Mexican Tea plant The specific flavor of the Chilean tree boldo (Peumus boldus) primarily originates from ascaridole. Ascaridole is also a major component of epazote (or Mexican tea, Dysphania ambrosioides, formerly Chenopodium ambrosioides) where it typically constitutes between 16 and 70% of the plant's essential oil. The content of ascaridole in the plant depends on cultivation and is maximal when the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in the soil is about 1:4. It also changes through the year peaking around the time when the plant seeds become mature. Applications Ascaridole is mainly used as an anthelmintic drug that expels parasitic worms (helminths) from the human body and plants. This property gave the name to the chemical, after Ascaris ‚Äì a genus of the large intestinal roundworm. In the early 1900s, it was a major remedy against intestinal parasites in humans, cats, dogs, goats, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs, and it is still used in livestock, particularly in the Central American countries. The dosage was specified by the ascaridole content in the oil, which was traditionally determined with an assay developed by Nelson in 1920. It was later substituted with modern gas chromatography and mass spectrometry methods. The worms and their larvae were killed by immersion in a solution of ascaridole in water (about 0.015 vol%) for 18 hours at or 12 hours at or 6 hours at . Meanwhile, such immersion did not damage the roots and stems of plants such as Iris, Phlox, Sedum and others at for 15 hours or longer. The wormseed plant itself (Mexican tea) is traditionally used in Mexican cuisine for flavoring dishes and preventing flatulence from bean- containing food. It is also part of tonic drinks and infusions to expel intestinal parasites and treat asthma, arthritis, dysentery, stomach ache, malaria, and nervous diseases in folk medicine practiced in North and South America, China, and Turkey.  Health issues  The usage of wormseed oil on humans is limited by the toxicity of ascaridole and has therefore been discouraged. In high doses, wormseed oil causes irritation of skin and mucous membranes, nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, vertigo, tinnitus, temporary deafness and blindness. Prolonged action induces depression of the central nervous system and delirium which transits into convulsions and coma. Long-term effects include pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs), hematuria, and albuminuria (presence of red blood cells and proteins in the urine, respectively) and jaundice (yellowish pigmentation of the skin). Fatal doses of wormseed oil were reported as one teaspoon for a 14-month-old baby (at once) and daily administration of 1 mL over three weeks to a 2-year-old child. Ascaridole is also carcinogenic in rats.

Alexandre Jacob (September 29, 1879 ‚Äì August 28, 1954), known as Marius Jacob, was a French anarchist illegalist. A clever burglar equipped with a sharp sense of humour, capable of great generosity towards his victims, he became one of the models for Maurice Leblanc's character Arsene Lupin.  A rough start  Jacob was born in 1879 in Marseille to a working- class family. At the age of twelve, he signed up as a sailor's apprentice for a voyage that would carry him to Sydney where he deserted from the crew. Of his voyage he would later say, \\"I saw the world; it is not beautiful\\". After a short episode of piracy, which he soon rejected as too cruel, he returned to Marseilles in 1897 and gave up navy life definitively, plagued by fevers which would accompany him for the rest of his life. As an apprentice typographer he attended anarchist meetings and met his future wife Rose. The parliamentary socialists of the late 19th century were opposed, often violently, to anarchists in the working world. Socialists sought to attain power legally through the electoral process. Anarchists, however, felt that social justice was not something that could be attained through the existing power structure, but instead had to be seized by the working classes. In the Europe of the Belle Epoque, after the repression of the Paris Commune, revolt tended towards the individual act of violence, often directed towards kings, politicians, soldiers, police officers, tyrants, and magistrates. Numerous militant anarchists were imprisoned and faced the guillotine. Men such as Ravachol, considered by many to be terrorists, were condemned to death. Caught with explosives after a string of minor larcenies, Jacob was condemned to six months in prison, after which he had difficulty reintegrating himself. From that point forward, he choose \\"a pacifistic illegalism.\\"  Criminal activity  In Toulon on July 3, 1899, Jacob pretended to suffer from hallucinations in order to avoid five years of reclusion. On April 19, 1900, he escaped from the asylum in Aix-en-Provence with the assistance of a male nurse and took refuge in S√®te. There he organized a band of men, calling them \\"the workers of the night.\\" The principles were simple: one does not kill, except to protect his life and his freedom from the police; one steals only from those considered to be social parasites - bosses, judges, soldiers, and the clergy - but never from the professions considered useful - architects, doctors, artists, etc.; finally, a percentage of the stolen money was to be invested into the anarchist cause. Jacob chose to avoid working with the idealistic anarchists and instead surrounded himself with criminals and fellow illegalists. To see whether those who they sought to burglarize were on their premises, Jacob's gang wedged pieces of paper into their doors and returned the following day to check if the paper was still in place. Additionally, Jacob became an expert on lock-picking doors and safes. Another clever criminal method involved entering an apartment from the floor above. Jacob would slip an umbrella through a small hole in the target apartment's ceiling. Once inserted, the umbrella could be opened to catch rubble and dampen the noise created by breaking through the ceiling. Between 1900 and 1903, operating with groups of two to four people, Jacob made over 150 burglaries in Paris, surrounding provinces and even abroad. But Jacob began to feel that his was a lost cause. One day while attempting to convert a workman to anarchism, Jacob obtained a significant answer: \\"And my retirement?\\" On April 21, 1903, an operation carried out in Abbeville turned sour. Having killed a police officer in order to escape, Jacob and his two accomplices were captured. Two years later in Amiens Jacob appeared in court. Anarchist supporters flocked to the city, creating a platform for his ideas. \\"You now know who I am: one revolted, living on the product of his burglings.\\" He escaped from the guillotine but was condemned to a life of forced labor in Cayenne.  Forced labor and resurrection  In Cayenne, Jacob maintained correspondence with his mother Marie, who never gave up on her son. He tried to escape seventeen times without success. Following the countrywide ban on forced labor (inspired by the writings of Albert Londres), Jacob returned to the city, where he suffered from depression until 1927, after which he relocated to Loire Valley where he became a commercial peddler and remarried (Rose having died during his time in prison). In 1929 Jacob was introduced to Louis Lecoin, director of the newspaper Libertaire. The two men resembled each other and built a lasting friendship. After the international support effort for anarchist prisoners Sacco and Vanzetti, they gave their support to prevent the extradition of Durruti, who had been promised the death penalty in Spain. In 1936, Jacob went to Barcelona in the hopes of aiding the syndicalist CNT, but convinced that there was no hope for the struggle in Spain, he returned to the market-life of France. While he did not engage directly in the French resistance (there were few anarchist networks, even though some libertarians, primarily Spanish, participated in the movement), partisans were able to find refuge in his home. His mother died (1941) and his wife (1947), surrounded by friends and comrades. While he never renounced his anarchist and anti-fascist convictions, he did express doubt regarding the merits of illegalism at the end of his life.

Gibson began use of the PAF on higher-model guitars in late 1956 and stopped in late 1962. They were replaced by the Patent Number (Pat No) pickup, essentially a refined version of the PAF. These were in turn replaced by \\"T-Top\\" humbuckers in 1967, and production ended in 1975. Though it is commonly mistaken as the first humbucker pickup, the PAF was the first humbucker to gain widespread use and notoriety. The PAF is an essential tonal characteristic of the now-famous 1957-1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard guitars, and pickups of this type have gained a large following. History Close-up of a \\"Patent Applied For\\" sticker =Development= In the mid-1950s Gibson looked to create a new guitar pickup different from existing popular single coil designs. Gibson had already developed the Charlie Christian pickup and P-90 in the 1930s and 40s; however, these designs‚Äîlike competitor Fender's single-coil pickups‚Äîwere fraught with inherent 60-cycle hum sound interference. Engineer and Gibson employee Seth Lover spent much of 1954 working on a noise-cancelling or \\"hum-bucking\\" guitar pickup design. By early 1955, the design was completed. In June 1955, Lover and Gibson filed a joint patent for the pickup design. =Early use= Gibson began switching from P-90s to PAFs first on the company's lap steel guitars in 1956, and then on electric guitars in 1957. Les Paul Goldtops and Customs were the first solid-body electric guitars to receive PAF humbuckers, and Gibson's ES Series were the first hollow/semi-hollow designs to receive them. In late 1957 a black sticker with gold lettering was applied to each pickup's underside, that read \\"PATENT APPLIED FOR.\\" Over time the Patent Applied For sticker present on these pickups has evolved into the acronym P.A.F. as a way to identify pickups with this sticker. The patent for Gibson's design was eventually issued on July 28, 1959. The acronym P.A.F. is also sometimes written as PAF leaving the periods out. However, in 1978 the word \\"PAF\\" was registered as a trademark by DiMarzio. This registered trademark should not to be confused with original P.A.F. acronym used to describe the original vintage pickups made by Gibson and the subject of this article. In 1958 the Goldtop model was dropped from production, and the sunburst Standard took its place. These guitars were all fitted with PAF humbuckers, which contributed greatly to the instruments' sound. =1961-1966= Early 1961 PAFs are almost exactly identical to the original 1957-1960 PAFs. In July 1961 Gibson standardized the PAF construction process with the introduction of the SG model. With this, smaller Alnico 2 and Alnico 5 magnets became standard. Transition to a new start lead location and a more formal number of wire winds was also introduced, leading to pickup DC resistance to center around 7.5kŒ©. In addition, around 1963 these pickups were given a new sticker that had a patent number written on it. However, the stickers were labelled with \\"\\" until 1962, which is the number issued to the 1952 Les Paul trapeze tailpiece design and not the humbucking pickups. Between 1965-1966, Gibson switched to polyurethane-coated wire from enamel-coated to cut costs and streamline pigtail lead soldering time, changing the wire color from purple to red. =1967-1980= With the reintroduction of a humbucker equipped Les Paul Custom in 1968, Gibson standardized a T-shaped tool mark on the top of humbucker bobbins. This new style of Gibson humbucker became known as the T-Top. The \\"T\\" located on the top of the bobbins helped workers ensure the bobbin was facing the correct way during the winding and assembly process. T-Top bobbins lose the distinctive square hole of the original PAF bobbins. In addition the coil former geometry of the T-Top bobbin differs from the coil former dimensions of PAF bobbins making T-Top bobbins slightly taller and more robust internally than PAF bobbins. Early T-Top humbuckers retain the same patent# sticker on the baseplate into the early 1970s. These early patent sticker T-Top humbuckers have the same wood spacer and short A2 and A5 magnets of the previous iteration. Eventually the patent sticker on the baseplate was replaced by a stamped patent number. With this change, other specification began to change such as magnet specifications and use of a plastic rather than wooden spacer. Gibson produced T-Top pickups through 1980 but many consider the early patent sticker T-Tops more collectible than later versions. =PAF reissues= In 1981 Gibson realized that there was a consumer demand for the sound of original PAF pickups. Engineer Tim Shaw designed a pickup that aimed to replicate the early design, reversing changes made in the 1960s and 1970s: a new bobbin without the \\"T\\", a correct small square hole back in both bobbins, and Alnico magnets. Shaw's efforts are generally considered to be the first of many recreations of the PAF humbucking pickup. However Gibson did not take Tim Shaw's recommendation to use plain enamel magnet wire due to cost concerns. As a result, Shaw era pickups still use polysol magnet wire. Gibson currently produces several reissues of PAFs including the \\"'57 Classic\\", \\"Burstbucker\\" and \\"Custom Buckers\\". Due to the popularity of vintage PAF pickups nearly 300 aftermarket pickups makers worldwide offer their version of the vintage design. Notable pickup makers include Seymour Duncan and ThroBak Electronics who are the only independent pickup makers to wind P.A.F. reproductions with original P.A.F. winding machines from the Kalamazoo factory. Other established companies making P.A.F. style pickups include Amber, Bareknuckle, DiMarzio, Kent Armstrong, Kloppmann Pickups, Lindy Fralin, Lollar, Mojotone, Monty's Guitars, Orpheus Pickups, OX4, Sheptone, Theo Dahlem Pickups, Wizz and Wolfetone. Signature sound Early PAFs are among the most-sought-after vintage humbucker pickups by guitarists, and each individual pickup is unique in terms of output level and tone. Factors that account for their sound are: * Gibson used four different machines to wind vintage P.A.F. pickups. Two of the four machines lacked auto stop mechanisms resulting in variation in turns for each of the bobbins that make up the P.A.F. pickup assembly. The resulting inconsistency in turn count led to variation in the output and tone. For the same reason, the two coils within each pickup unit usually have a slightly different number of turns, which affects the treble overtones of the assembled pickup. * Gibson used Alnico magnets in PAFs, the same magnet as used in the P-90. Alnico has several different grades with different tonal properties. In original P.A.F. pickups the grades Alnico 2, 3, 4 and 5 were used (with Alnico 3 being the least common). * Original P.A.F. magnets were charged in groups. This process yielded magnets that were not fully charged to saturation. Vintage P.A.F. and P-90 magnets therefore can lose some charge over time, which affects the tone of the pickup. (P-90's in particular are more prone to this effect.)

Before its original dissolution in 1951, it was primarily made up of African-American soldiers. History The 24th Infantry Regiment (one of the Buffalo Soldier regiments) was organized on 1 November 1869 from the 38th U.S. (Colored) Infantry Regiment (formed 24 July 1866) and the 41st U.S. (Colored) Infantry Regiment (formed 27 July 1866). All the enlisted soldiers were black, either veterans of the U.S. Colored Troops or freedmen. From its activation until 1898, the 24th Infantry served throughout the Western United States. Its missions included garrisoning frontier posts, battling American Indians, protecting roadways against bandits, guarding the border between the United States and Mexico. Medal of honor: *Wham Paymaster Robbery, Arizona Territory 11 May 1889  Sergeant Benjamin Brown, Corporal Isaiah Mays *Black Seminole: United States Scouts, Canyon Blanco, Staked Plains, Texas (Red River War) Private Adam Payne *Black Seminole: United States Scouts, Pecos Texas 25 April 1875  Sergeant John Ward, trumpeter Isaac Payne, private Pompey Factor =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= The year 1898 saw the 24th Infantry deployed to Cuba as part of the U.S. Expeditionary Force in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Elements of the 24th participated in the storming of the Spanish fortress in the Battle of El Caney. At the climactic Battle of San Juan Hill under the command of Emerson H. Liscum, supported by intensive fire from the Gatling Gun Detachment, units of the 24th Infantry accompanied by elements of the 6th and 13th Infantry Regiments, assaulted and seized the Spanish-held blockhouse and trench system atop San Juan Hill. = Vancouver Barracks = Company B arrived on 3 April 1899 at Vancouver Barracks - the first African American regiment to serve as part of the garrison there. =Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War= The 24th U.S. Infantry at drill, Camp Walker, Philippine Islands 1902 In 1899 the regiment deployed to the Philippine Islands to help suppress a guerrilla movement in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The regiment returned to the Islands in 1905 and 1911. Though the 24th fought a number of battles in the Philippines, one of the most notable occurred on 7 December 1899, when nine soldiers from the regiment routed 100 guerrillas from their trenches. =Mexican border= In 1916 the 24th Infantry guarded the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border to keep the Mexican Revolution from spilling onto U.S. soil. When it did, the 24th joined the \\"Punitive Expedition\\" under General Pershing and entered Mexico to fight Pancho Villa's forces. In 1919, rebels and troops of the Mexican government fought in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, which borders the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas. The 24th Infantry crossed over again to engage the rebels, ensuring that no violence erupted across the U.S. border. =Pre-World War I and the Houston Riot= During the nadir of American race relations and just months after America's entry into World War I, the soldiers of this historic all-black unit had been dispatched to guard the construction of Camp Logan, a military facility in Harris County, where they met animosity from local white civilians. When white police beat and arrested a black private who tried to intervene during a violent, daytime arrest of a black washer woman, the woman, Sarah Travers, and the soldier, Pvt Alonso Edwards, were jailed. A black corporal sent to inquire after the private, was pistol- whipped, chased and shot at, before being dragged out from under a bed and arrested. After untrue rumors of the corporal's murder spread to other soldiers, hostility boiled over. The Houston Riot was a mutiny by 150 black soldiers of the Twenty-fourth United States Infantry, called the Camp Logan Riots. Sergeant Vida Henry of I Company, 3rd Battalion led about 150 black soldiers in a two-hour march on Houston because they had suffered racial discrimination in the city. The soldiers were met by local policemen and a great crowd of Houston residents, who had armed themselves. When the soldiers killed Captain J.W. Mattes of the Illinois National Guard (after mistaking him for a local policeman), the battalion fell into disarray. Sgt. Henry shot himself, distraught over having killed another serviceman. In their two-hour march on the city, the battalion killed 15 armed whites, including four policemen, and seriously wounded 12 others, one of whom, a policeman, subsequently died. Four black soldiers were killed. Two were accidentally shot by their own men, one in camp and the other on San Felipe Street. The riot took place over one evening, and resulted in the deaths of four soldiers and 15 civilians. The rioters were tried at three courts-martial. Fourteen were executed, and 41 were given life sentences. =World War II= At the start of World War II, the 24th Infantry was stationed at Fort Benning as school troops for the Infantry School. They participated in the Carolina Maneuvers of October ‚Äì December 1941. During World War II, the 24th Infantry fought in the South Pacific Theatre as a separate regiment. Deploying on 4 April 1942 from the San Francisco Port of Embarkation, the regiment arrived on Efate in the New Hebrides Islands on 4 May 1942.The 24th Infantry Division Association website, POB 7, Flourtown, PA A Company was sent to Espirto Santo to clear jungle with the 3rd Naval Construction Battalion Detachment building an airfield at Turtle Bay. Another Company was sent to Noum√©a to work with B Co. on CB 3 on Ile Nou. First they worked on extending a Navy landing pier. When that was done they assisted in pontoon assembly.Building the Navy's Bases in World War II, Vol. II (Part III), GPO Washington DC, 1947, p.224 The 24th moved to Guadalcanal on 28 August 1943, and was assigned to the XIV Corps. 1st Battalion deployed to Bougainville, attached to the 37th Infantry Division, from March to May 1944 for perimeter defense duty. The regiment departed Guadalcanal on 8 December 1944, and landed on Saipan and Tinian on 19 December 1944 for Garrison Duty that included mopping up the remaining Japanese forces that had yet to surrender. The regiment was assigned to the Pacific Ocean Area Command on 15 March 1945, and then to the Central Pacific Base Command on 15 May 1945, and to the Western pacific Base Command on 22 June 1945. The regiment departed Saipan and Tinian on 9 July 1945, and arrived on the Kerama Islands off Okinawa on 29 July 1945. At the end of the war, the 24th took the surrender of forces on the island of Aka-shima, the first formal surrender of a Japanese Imperial Army garrison. The regiment remained on Okinawa through 1946. =Korean War= From the end of World War II through 1947, the 24th occupied Okinawa, Japan, after which it relocated to Gifu, Japan. On 1 February 1947, the regiment reorganized as a permanent regiment of the 25th Infantry Division. Despite the desegregation of the U.S. armed forces in 1948 by Executive Order 9981, the 24th Infantry remained predominantly African‚ÄìAmerican, with an officer corps of both African and European Americans. In late June 1950, soon after North Korea invaded South Korea, the 24th deployed to Korea to assist in the Korean War. The 24th Infantry fought throughout the entire Korean peninsula, from the defense of the \\"Pusan Perimeter\\" to its breakout and the pursuit of the Korean People's Army (KPA) into North Korea, to the Chinese counteroffensives and finally to U.N. counteroffensives that stabilized near the current Korean Demilitarized Zone. The regiment received the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for its defense of the Pusan Perimeter. The regiment also had three posthumous Medal of Honor recipients: Cornelius H. Charlton, Ray E. Duke and William Thompson. The cases of Lieutenant Leon Gilbert, court martialed for refusing an order from the 24th's commanding officer (who was white), and of some other members of the 24th, helped bring greater attention to problems of segregation and discrimination within the U.S. military. The landing at Inchon by U.S. and ROK forces on 15 September finally compelled the KPA to withdraw from the Pusan Perimeter. The 24th Infantry was divided into Task Forces Blair and Corley (named for their commanders), and they, along with several from other commands, began pursuing the KPA on 27 September. 24th Infantry moves up to the firing line. The 25th Division remained in South Korea until ordered north in late November to participate in the Home by Christmas offensive. Later in November, overwhelming assaults by Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) troops forced the U.S. Eighth Army to withdraw. On 29 November, the Chinese 40th Army flanked the 24th Infantry's line north of the Chongchon River in North Korea, forcing the neighboring 9th Regiment, 2nd Division to withdraw. On 30 November, the 3/24th was at Kunu-ri, on the division's open right flank, with PVA troops behind it. With the help of air support, the battalion extricated itself, losing one soldier killed, 30 wounded and 109 missing. Overall, the 24th Infantry lost one-fifth of its officers and one-third of its enlisted men in the withdrawal across the Chongchon. Colonel Corley blamed the disarray of the 3rd Battalion on its commander, Lt. Col. Melvin E. Blair, whom he summarily relieved. The Eighth Army's withdrawal did not cease until the force was well below the 39th parallel north. But by early March 1951, the American and ROK troops were again ready for a full-scale offensive. On 6 March, the 25th Division advanced across the Han River. The 1/24th did well, moving over difficult terrain against an entrenched enemy. The 3rd Battalion initially also performed well, executing a hastily devised river crossing and advancing through rough country against well dug-in PVA troops, far from the 1st Battalion. While climbing up steep terrain, however, the 1/24th reportedly collapsed under PVA fire and withdrew in disorder. When the Division commander learned of that action, his confidence in the 24th plummeted. Many soldiers of the 24th ran away from the fight, tossing their weapons and equipment aside. A derisive poem throughout the U.S. Army stated: When them Chinese mortars begins to thud, the Old Deuce-Four begin to bug. Although the 24th performed well in the attack north of the Han and the subsequent general withdrawal of the Eighth Army after the Chinese Spring Offensive of 1951, its reputation was somewhat tarnished. But it performed well in the Army's drive back north in May and June 1951. In August, the regiment's new commander, Colonel Thomas D. Gillis, prodded by the Division commander, closely examined the 24th's record in Korea. Determining that leadership had been the problem, he relieved a number of officers. After the change in command, Company F conducted a valiant bayonet and grenade charge on 15 September. However the positive performance of Company F was ignored by higher commands and the news media. By 1 October 1951, the 24th was dissolved. Modern legacy The 24th Infantry was re- instituted in 1995 and assigned to the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division in Fort Lewis, Washington. The regiment served in the Iraq War from 2004 to 2005, and was decorated for its service. In 2006, during a re-organization of the Army, the regiment was re-flagged; however, the 1st Battalion was not included, and so it alone retains the regimental designation and carries on its legacy. It is now part of the 1st Brigade Combat Team (Stryker), 25th Infantry Division at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. =Operation Iraqi Freedom= The 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division \\"Lightning\\" (a Stryker brigade), and served in Iraq from October 2004 to October 2005. The battalion came home with 5 Silver Stars, 31 Bronze Stars, and 181 Purple Hearts and played a crucial role in the Battle of Mosul (2004). During that battle, the battalion saw some of the heaviest, sustained fighting of the insurgency to date. The unit was also awarded with the Valorous Unit Award as being part of the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (SBCT). The unit reflagged as the 3rd Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment and moved to Vilseck, Germany. The 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment replaced the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment of the now decommissioned 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team as of 14 December 2006. In 2008‚Äì2009, 1-24 Infantry deployed to Diyala Governorate, Iraq to FOB Warhorse and later to FOB Grizzly. In contrast to their previous deployment involving the Battle of Mosul, 1-24 sustained very few casualties, none of which came from sustained engagement with enemy forces. For their reconstruction and humanitarian efforts during this tour, the unit was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation along with sister units in the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division \\"Lightning\\". =Operation Enduring Freedom= The 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment deployed again under 1/25 SBCT to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2011‚Äì2012. The battalion assumed responsibility for the Zabul Province, with assistance from Romanian units along Highway 1. The battalion HQ was primarily stationed at FOB Lagman in Zabul Province with companies co-located and dispersed north and south. 1-24 Infantry found themselves in a direct combat role again, losing several soldiers to Taliban attacks throughout their yearlong deployment, including an \\"insider attack\\" in Qalat on 8 January 2012.

Historically, it was one of the Army's four segregated African American regiments. The regiment saw combat during the Indian and Spanish‚ÄìAmerican Wars. During Westward Expansion, the regiment provided security for the early western settlers and defended the American borders against Indian bands, Mexican encroachment, and criminal elements. , the 1st Battalion and 4th Squadron serve with the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division as a combined arms battalion and an armored reconnaissance squadron, respectively, while the 6th Squadron is the armored reconnaissance squadron of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the division. All three units are stationed at Fort Hood.  Formation  9th Cavalry insignia The regiment was authorized on 28 July 1866 to become the 9th United States Cavalry Regiment. On 3 August 1866, Major General Philip H. Sheridan, commanding the Military Division of the Gulf, was \\"authorized to raise, among others, one regiment of colored (African-American) cavalry to be designated the 9th Regiment of U.S. Cavalry\\".At the same time, Lt. Gen. William T. Sherman, commanding the Military Division of the Mississippi, was directed to form one regiment of colored regulars to be designated the 10th Regiment U.S. Cavalry. The regiment was formally organized on 21 September 1866 in New Orleans, Louisiana, and mustered between September 1866 and 31 March 1867. Its first commanding officer was Colonel Edward Hatch. The men enlisted for the usual term of five years and privates received $13 per month, plus room, board, and clothing. They soon gained the nickname of \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\". The regiment's motto is \\"We Can, We Will\\". The mustering, organized by Maj. Francis Moore, 65th U. S. Colored Infantry, formed the nucleus of the enlisted strength, and was obtained from New Orleans and its vicinity. In the autumn of 1866 recruiting began in Kentucky, and all the men of the 9th were obtained from that state and Louisiana. The horses were obtained at St. Louis, Missouri. About the middle of September all recruits were assembled in New Orleans, where empty cotton presses were used as barracks. An epidemic of cholera caused 29 soldiers' deaths between October and December, with 46 other soldiers deserting by the end of March 1867. The camp was moved to Carrollton, a suburb of New Orleans. Officer positions did not begin to be fully staffed until February 1867. By the end of March 1867, the 9th Cavalry was at nearly full strength with a total of 885 enlisted men, or an average of over 70 to a Troop, and was ordered to San Antonio, Texas, where it arrived early in April for three months of training. However, Troops L and M went directly to their duty station at Brownsville, Texas. In April 1867, violent altercations between officers and soldiers occurred in Lieutenant Edward Heyl's Troop E and Lieutenant Fred Smith's Troop K near San Antonio as a result of poor morale and poor leadership. Sergeant Harrison Bradford and Lieutenant Seth E. Griffin died and 10 soldiers deserted from E Troop. The soldiers at this point still had not been introduced to the Articles of War, and so two soldiers convicted to death were pardoned and restored to duty.  Service  = Indian wars = Captain and troopers of the 9th Cavalry, 1880. A Signal Corps sergeant is in the foreground. In July 1867 the 9th Cavalry was ordered to western and southwestern Texas, to maintain law and order between the Rio Grande and Concho Rivers along a 630-mile line with seven forts from Fort Clark to Fort Quitman near present-day El Paso (the forts ended up including Fort Quitman, Fort Davis, Fort Stockton, Fort Lancaster, Fort Clark, Fort Duncan, Fort McKavett, and Fort Concho). Regimental Headquarters and Troops A, B, E and K, under Col. Hatch, were stationed at Fort Stockton; Troops C, D, F, G, H and I, under Lt. Col. Wesley Merritt were at Fort Davis. Troops L and M under 1st Lt. Hamilton had previously been sent to Brownsville. The 9th remained in Texas for eight years, nearly all of it in the field. While in Texas, the troops battled intermittently with Apaches, Kiowas, and Comanches, escorted mail, and rescued civilians from native populations. On December 26, 1867, K Troop lost three troopers at Fort Lancaster by an estimated force of 900 natives and outlaws. The regiment went to New Mexico Military District, which covered parts of New Mexico, Colorado and Texas, and participated in the Apache Wars from 1875 to 1881. Headquarters were at Fort Union. While in New Mexico, duties included constructing barracks and stables, caring for the horse herds, scouting for hostile natives, escorting the mail, surveying uncharted land, and constructing roads. That service also included the Battle of Tularosa with Chiricahua Apache warriors led by Victorio in May 1880. The 9th Cavalry was transferred to Fort Riley, Kansas, in 1881, and to Fort Robinson, Nebraska, in 1885. On 5 November 1887, Company H, of the 9th Cavalry fought at the Battle of Crow Agency during the Crow War, at Crow Agency, Montana. The regiment also patrolled during the Ghost Dance War with the Sioux about the time of the Wounded Knee Massacre, and it was the last regiment to leave the Pine Ridge Reservation in the Winter of 1890-1891 following the massacre. = Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War through WW1 = The 9th and 10th cavalry in the Battle of Las Guasimas, Cuba, 1898. In 1898, the 9th US Cavalry Regiment fought alongside Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders at the battles of Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill. Later, they served as his honor guard during his visit to San Francisco. In 1899 and again in 1904, the 9th Cavalry patrolled Yosemite National Park joining other cavalry and infantry as the first \\"rangers\\" of the park system. Under General John J. Pershing, the regiment fought in the Punitive Expedition against Pancho Villa in Mexico in 1916. The regiment spent World War I in the Philippines. From 3 April 1921 to 11 October 1922, Brigadier general Edward Anderson commanded the regiment.Davis, Henry Blaine. Generals in Khaki. Raleigh, NC: Pentland Press, 1998. p. 8 On 1 March 1933, the 9th Cavalry was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Division.  West Point  On 23 March 1907, the United States Military Academy Detachment of Cavalry was changed to a \\"colored\\" unit. This had been a long time coming. It had been proposed in 1897 at the \\"Cavalry and Light Artillery School\\" at Fort Riley, Kansas that West Point cadets learn their riding skills from the black non- commissioned officers who were considered among the best. The one hundred man detachment from the 9th Cavalry served to teach future officers at West Point riding instruction, mounted drill and cavalry tactics until 1947. = World War II = The 9th Cavalry was relieved 10 October 1940 from its assignment to the 3rd Cavalry Division and transferred to the 2nd Cavalry Division for deployment in World War II. However, the regiment did not serve in that war as a unit. It was transferred to the Mediterranean to supply soldiers for other units. It was therefore inactivated on 7 March 1944 in North Africa. = Cold War = The regiment was redesignated as the 509th Tank Battalion on 20 October 1950 and relieved from its assignment to the 2nd Cavalry Division. The battalion was activated at Camp Polk, Louisiana on 1 November of that year and inactivated at Fort Knox on 10 April 1956. The regiment was reorganized and redesignated as the 9th Cavalry on 1 December 1957, becoming a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. The 1st Reconnaissance Squadron, 9th Cavalry was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division in Korea and activated on 1 November 1957 from the 1st Cavalry Division's 16th Reconnaissance Company as the division reconnaissance squadron. It became 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry (1-9 Cavalry) on 1 September 1963, and was transferred to Fort Benning on 1 July 1965 without personnel and equipment to become an experimental air cavalry unit, reflagged from the 3rd Squadron, 17th Cavalry of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test). The former 1-9 Cavalry in Korea became 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry of the 2nd Infantry Division. The 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron, 9th Cavalry was assigned to the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Carson and activated on 1 December 1957 from its 9th Reconnaissance Company as the division reconnaissance squadron. It was transferred to the 24th Infantry Division and reorganized in Europe on 1 July 1958, stationed at Augsburg.Directory and Station List of the United States Army, 1959, p. 448 The squadron became the 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry (2-9 Cavalry) on 1 September 1963. The 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron, 9th Cavalry was assigned to the Army Reserve and activated on 6 April 1959 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as the divisional reconnaissance squadron of the 79th Infantry Division. The squadron was inactivated there on 28 February 1963 when the 79th was reduced to a headquarters. It was redesignated as Troop C, 9th Cavalry and reactivated on 1 February 1964 at Bristol with the 157th Infantry Brigade. The troop was moved to Wilkes-Barre on 31 January 1966. The troop continued to serve with the 157th Infantry Brigade (Mech) until deactivation on 20 August 1995.Spearhead. (1995, Summer). Troop C, 9th Cavalry, 8(2), 9. (Newsletter of the 157th SIB(M)) The 4th Reconnaissance Squadron, 9th Cavalry was assigned to the Army Reserve and activated on 20 March 1959 at Mansfield, Ohio as the divisional reconnaissance squadron of the 83rd Infantry Division. The squadron became the 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry (4-9 Cavalry) on 15 April 1963, but was inactivated on 31 December 1965. On 24 November 1967 it was reactivated as a Regular Army unit with the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell. The squadron was reactivated in April, 1986, at Ladd Army Airfield, Hangar 2,Fort Wainwright, Alaska, with the 6th Infantry Division, where it served during the later years of the Cold War. https://www.army.mil/article/42315/from_cold_weather_tests_to_strykers_and_helicopters_70_years_of_history The 5th Squadron, 9th Cavalry (5-9 Cavalry) was activated on 21 December 1962 at Fort Ord with the 194th Armored Brigade. 5-9 Cavalry was inactivated there on 4 January 1968, redesignated as Troop E, 9th Cavalry, and simultaneously reactivated at Fort Ord as a nondivisional unit.  Vietnam War (Air Cav)  A rifle squad from the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry exiting from a UH-1D The then-experimental 1-9 Air Cav ushered in a new era of combat called, air assault. These teams were composed of aero-weapons (Reds), aero-scout (Whites), and aero-rifle (Blues). Together, ground (D Troop), and air reconnaissance teams patrolled the Vietnam countryside in search of the enemy. Once located, the infantry (Blues) would insert (and extract) via helicopter or foot to engage the enemy with support of their aero scouts and aero weapons. These teams earned the nickname of \\"Headhunters.\\" This concept differed from conventional front line warfare typical in prior land warfare. On December 5, 1970, 9th Air Cavalry Brigade (Provisional) was formed by 1 Cavalry as an ad-hoc brigade and organized by operations order OPORD 1-70 consisting of: * 1/9 Cavalry  HQ Troop, A, B, C, D, E,& F Troops * 3/17 Cavalry  HQ Troop and A, B & E Troops The brigade was responsible for 5,976 square miles. During the Vietnam war, the 1st of the 9th Cavalry earned 3 Presidential Unit citations and 5 Valorous Unit Citations. It was inactivated on 26 February 1973 and was one of the last conventional units to leave Vietnam. In 1971, as the 1st Cavalry Division began redeployment to the United States, Troop F, 9th Cavalry was formed from one platoon each from the 1-8 Cavalry, 2-5 Cavalry, 1-12 Cavalry and 1-7 Cavalry. This unit operated independently of the 1-9 Cavalry. Troop F was inactivated in Vietnam on 26 February 1973.  1976 to 1986  The 2d Squadron, 9th Cavalry was assigned to the far end of the runways at Hunter Army Air Field (HAAF) under the command of LTC J. Longhofer as an Air Cav Unit (under the 24th Infantry). In 1977 D-Troop under the leadership of Cpt Maldonado and Medal of Honor Recipient Frank D. Miller attended the Jungle Operations Training Center program at Ft. Sherman, Panama Canal with one medic from the HHT. In 1977 the HHT, A-Troop, B-Troop were moved 40 miles away to Ft Stewart where it was re- designated as an Air and Armored Cavalry. D-Troop remained at HAAF during this time. While D-Troop maintained the Rotary Wings Aircraft and Cavalry Recon Scouts (Airmobile ‚Äì Air Assault group), A-Troop was given APC's armored personnel carriers and B-Troop had many of the larger track vehicles. HHT had APC's for the medical section and S1-S3. The medics continued to maintain two gamma-goats, but received two new APC's ‚Äì one 577 command track and 113 ambulance. The 2d Squadron, 9th Cavalry remained a part of the 24th Infantry at Ft. Stewart and HAAF until 1986 when the unit was re-designated the 2d Squadron, 4th Cavalry. = Return to Ft Hood, TX = After Vietnam, the Squadron returned to Fort Hood, Texas with the rest of the 1st Cavalry Division and served as divisional recon squadron until 16 October 1986, when it was inactivated. On 25 November 1992, the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry was reactivated, reorganized as a mechanized infantry battalion, re-designated as the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry and assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division as part of the 3rd Brigade. = Operation Just Cause; Panama = The 2d Squadron, 9th Cavalry, assigned to the 7th Infantry Division (Light), deployed to Panama (Dec 20, 1989 ‚Äì Jan 31, 1990) in order to conduct combat operations during Operation Just Cause and the ensuing humanitarian and nation building mission Operation Promote Liberty. The Air Troops were the first to deploy with their AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters and their OH-59 (OH-58 Kiowa) aerial scout helicopters. D Troop,2-9th Cavalry soon followed and conducted route clearance, zone reconnaissance, and provided support to U.S. Army units in the interior. The D 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry was station in Warner Kaserne Munich Germany 1962-1968 and Reforged to Ft. Riley Kansas in 1968. = Desert peacekeepers and beyond = The 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry was reconstituted as infantry from the highly decorated Persian Gulf War unit; 3-41 Infantry of the 2nd Armored Division in 1992 and assigned to the 3d Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division. It served in combat as 3-41 Infantry of the Tiger Brigade in Operation Desert Storm. (As a side note, the Third Brigade was led by then Colonel George Casey Jr. and the 1st Cavalry Division was led by future Democratic presidential candidate General Wesley Clark Sr.) 1-9 Cavalry was a rapidly deployable infantry unit of action which deployed abroad several times in the decade; to thwart aggressive and hostile maneuvers of the Iraqi Army. Most notably in Operations Intrinsic Action and Iris Gold. 1-9 Cavalry was designated as the military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) unit of the 1st Cavalry Division. Following is a brief rendition of significant events during this time period. 1993: * Three soldiers killed on Lone Star North Range. * NTC deployment. * Intrinsic Action I deployment to S.W. Asia. * Operation Iris Gold (Combat patch authorized) 1994: * Claymore mine accident severely injured a 1st lieutenant from Company A. * Cambrian Patrol (special operations competitive patrol in England) set range live fire record (Company E). * Two soldiers from Company E killed. 1995: * Two soldiers from HHC killed. * Soldier injured by grenade blast at tire house. 1996: * Intrinsic Action II deployment to SW Asia.  21st century  Today, the units of the 9th United States Cavalry Regiment provide RSTA (reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition) capabilities forward of enemy lines and supply infantrymen as sniper and long range surveillance teams for use as special reconnaissance in the area of combat operations. These small Army reconnaissance units, provide valuable real-time intelligence about an enemy nation, including its leaders, combat capabilities etc. Gathered intelligence Information is fed into various intelligence agency assets and databases including the national target base. The 9th United States Cavalry units fought against both the armed conventional and unconventional enemies in the decade-long \\"Global War on Terror\\" in both the Afghanistan and Iraq theaters. They developed and tested many new military doctrines and tactics when searching for, locating, observing and destroying the insurgent enemy and their war fighting assets, just as they had during the Indian, Spanish-American and Vietnam Wars. The unit has received numerous Presidential Unit Citations and Valorous Unit Awards as well as decorations for individual valor have been awarded to the 9th United States Cavalry Regiment and her combat soldiers. = Troop B = Troop B (\\"Bloody Knife\\"), 9th Cavalry, 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, was deployed from Fort Carson, Colorado, to Iraq in April 2003. After arriving at Camp Wolfe, Kuwait the unit moved to Camp New Jersey in Northern Kuwait. The lead elements of the Brigade Reconnaissance Troop (BRT) then crossed into Iraq, covering a distance of over 300 kilometers. This combat operation was the first for the 4th Infantry Division since Vietnam. The BRT has operated in Samarra East Airfield, Samarra, Ad Dawr, Tikrit East, Tuz Khurmat, Jalula, MEK, Daquq, Kirkuk, Taza Khormatu, Al Huwayjah, Ad Duluyah, At Tarmyia, Ad Dujayl, and Balad South. On 23 October 2003, the soldiers of Troop B-9th Cavalry were issued their combat patches (e.g., the authorization to wear the division patch on the right shoulder) for conducting combat operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The troop consisted of two platoons of scouts and one platoon of COLT (Combat Observation Lasing Teams). The unit deployed under the command of CPT William Sachse and redeployed under the command of CPT Clinton Fuller. The Bloody Knife Troop became the quick reaction force for one of the largest logistics bases in Iraq while still conducting operations where ever the brigade needed them. The Bloody Knife Troop was one of the last reconnaissance troops to fall directly under a brigade headquarters. = 1st Squadron = The 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment (1-9th Cav), is stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, as an armored reconnaissance squadron of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division. Originally part of the 3rd BCT at Fort Hood, the \\"1st of the 9th\\" moved to Fort Bliss to fill the RSTA (reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition) needs of the newly created 4th BCT in October 2005. The unit is nicknamed the \\"Headhunters\\". The unit was featured as the command of LTC Kilgore in the movie Apocalypse Now. The 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment (1-9th Cav), began deployment to Iraq in September 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Headquarters & Headquarters Troop (HHT) and Troop C, 1-9th Cav were assigned an Army National Guard infantry unit (Company C, 1st Battalion, 153rd Infantry, ARNG), a combat engineer unit (Company A, 8th Engineers), a support unit (215) and a civil support unit to comprise Task Force 1-9 (TF HEADHUNTER). Companies A and B, 1-9th Cav, were assigned to other task forces in Iraq, notably Task Force All American (TF-AA). During their first deployment, 124 Purple Heart medals were awarded to Task Force 1-9 soldiers, who operated in one of the most dangerous sections of Iraq, including the 2004 Battles of Sadr City and Haifa street. In October 2006, the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, began its second deployment to Iraq from Fort Bliss, Texas, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, along with the rest of 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, to work alongside units of the 25th Infantry Division to comprise Task Force Lightning. The Area of Operations for 1-9 CAV during the 06-08 OIF rotation was Mosul, Iraq in the Nineveh Province. After a seven-month duration of operations 1-9 CAV conducted an intra-theater deployment from Mosul to Tal Afar replacing 3/4 CAV for eight months to complete a 15-month rotation. In March 2008, 8th Squadron, 10th Cavalry of the 4th Infantry Division was reflagged as the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry, part of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division. In June 2008, 1-9th Cav deployed to OIF 08-10 to CSC SCANIA and assumed responsibilities for MSR TAMPA and the cities of Hamza, Qasim, Hashimiyah, Ash Shumali and other smaller towns from 3rd Squadron, 73rd Cavalry of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. In August 2008, 1-9th Cav was given orders to build a forward operating base (FOB) along the Iranian border in order to interdict lethal accelerants from being smuggled. The base is known as FOB Hunter and is in the Maysan province which resides in the marsh lands of Iraq. = 2nd Squadron = The 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry was stationed in Munich Germany 1963‚Äì1968. It was reassigned to Fort Riley, Kansas in 1968. During Operation Desert Storm, it served as the 24th Infantry Division's Divisional Cavalry Squadron and was based at Fort Stewart, Georgia. It was reflagged in 1996 to 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry when the 24th Infantry Division was reflagged to the 3rd Infantry Division. In 2003, it was reactivated at Fort Carson, Colorado as Troop B, 9th Cavalry and served as the Brigade Recon Troop for 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom I. As part of the conversion to modular Brigade Combat Teams, Troop B was expanded back into an armored reconnaissance squadron for 3d Brigade. The squadron, nicknamed \\"Hunters,\\" deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom IV, serving in two provinces: first in Salah ad-Din near ad- Dawr, first as an attachment to the 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, and then in Diyala with the rest of the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, after handing over the base in ad-Dawr to A \\"Gators\\" Battery, 1st Battalion, 319th Field Artillery Regiment of the 3rd BCT, 82d Airborne Division, and the Iraqi Army. The 2nd Squadron was inactivated on 18 October 2007, and reflagged as the 4th Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment (4-10th Cav). = 4th Squadron = The 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry, \\"Darkhorse\\" is stationed at Fort Hood, Texas and is the armored reconnaissance squadron for the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division. Corporal John Ross, Troop I, 9th Cavalry, the Buffalo Soldier Memorial at Fort Bliss During Operation Iraqi Freedom 06-08, the Darkhorse deployed with Black Jack to Baghdad, Iraq, where it secured the International Zone‚Äîthe area of central Baghdad that is home to the U.S. Embassy, Iraqi Council of Representatives, and numerous other Iraqi and Coalition governmental offices. The squadron's responsibilities were later expanded to conduct counterinsurgency operations throughout the Karkh District. In 2009 the squadron again deployed to Iraq, this time to Kirkuk Province for OIF 09-10, where it was responsible for the security, stability, and reconstruction of the Daquq district and the Taza, Laylan, and Rashaad sub-districts. The squadron partnered with the 15th Iraqi Army Brigade and Iraqi police from each of its districts to conduct area security and stability operations for an operating environment of over 3,000 square kilometers. The squadron also helped to balance ethnic tensions through the training and equipping Iraqi security forces, improvement of essential services, and the support and promotion of the legitimate government. In 2011 the squadron deployed a third time to Iraq, in support of Operation New Dawn. In 2013 the squadron deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In June 2017 the squadron deployed to The Republic of South Korea. In October 2019 the squadron deployed to Poland and are currently there. = 5th Squadron = The 5th Squadron, 9th Cavalry, was reconstituted at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, with headquarters at Wheeler Army Airfield. Its motto is \\"We can, we will.\\" The unit consisted of one ground troop (A) and two air troops (B & C). Each air troop consisted of a scout platoon, flying the OH-58A+ Kiowa, and a gun platoon, flying the AH-1 Cobra.

He earned a Doctorate in Law from the University of Paris in 1967 and graduated the same year from the French National School of Magistrate, first in his class. In August 1968 he joined the barAdrien Houngb√©dji, Il n'y a de richesse que d'hommes . in Cotonou where he ran a prominent law office. After agreeing to represent an opponent of the regime of Mathieu K√©r√©kou, he was arrested in February 1975. On March 5, 1975, Houngb√©dji escaped from prison and fled into exile; shortly afterward he was sentenced to death. He went to Paris, then to Dakar, Senegal, where he taught law, before going to Libreville, Gabon, where he again practiced law. In Gabon he was close to President Omar Bongo, and Bongo encouraged Houngb√©dji to return to Benin in December 1989 after an amnesty was issued by the K√©r√©kou regime, providing him with a plane and sending a Gabonese Minister of State to accompany him. Houngb√©dji participated in the February 1990 National Conference that led the country towards a multi- party democracy. He was favored by K√©r√©kou to become prime minister at the National Conference, but Nic√©phore Soglo found more favor with the delegates, and Houngb√©dji withdrew from the contest prior to the vote, in which Soglo was elected.Jennifer C. Seely, \\"African Transitions to Democracy: Bargaining among Social Groups\\" .Chris Allen, \\"'Goodbye to All That': The Short and Sad Story of Socialism in Benin\\", in Marxism's Retreat from Africa, ed. Arnold Hughes, page 71. Although considered by many to have been an ally of the K√©r√©kou regime at the time of the National Conference, Houngb√©dji has written that he was actually an \\"enlightened adversary\\" of the regime. In March 1990 he founded the Democratic Renewal Party, and in early 1991 he was elected to the National Assembly of Benin. He ran in the March 1991 presidential election, taking fifth place with 4.54% of the vote.Elections in Benin, African Elections Database.

Originally to be named after the River Derwent, the ship was renamed before her 1914 launch because of a naming conflict with a Royal Navy vessel. Huon was commissioned into the RAN in late 1915, and after completion was deployed to the Far East. In mid-1917, Huon and her five sister ships were transferred to the Mediterranean. Huon served as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship until a collision with sister ship in August 1918 saw Huon drydocked for the rest of World War I. After a refit in England, Huon returned to Australia in 1919. The destroyer spent several periods alternating between commissioned and reserve status over the next nine years, with the last three spent as a reservist training ship. Huon was decommissioned for the final time in 1928, and was scuttled in 1931 after being used as a target ship. Design and construction Huon was one of the second batch of s ordered for the RAN.

The ship's company consisted of 5 officers and 60 sailors. At launch, the ship's armament consisted of a single 4-inch Mark VIII gun, three 12-pounder guns, a .303-inch Maxim gun, two .303-inch Lewis guns, and three revolving torpedo tubes for 18-inch torpedoes. Four depth charge chutes were installed in 1917, although two were later removed in 1919. Two depth charge throwers were added during a 1918 refit; at the same time, one of the torpedo tubes was removed. The ship was laid down at Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 25 January 1913. She was launched on 19 December 1914 by the wife of federal politician Jens Jensen.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 46 Huon was commissioned into the RAN on 14 December 1915, and completed on 4 February 1916. The ship was originally to be named HMAS Derwent, after the Derwent River, but this was changed after the British Admiralty complained that there would be easy confusion with the Royal Navy destroyer . Operational history Huon first served with the British Far East Patrol, based at Sandakan, then later Singapore, from June 1916 to May 1917. On 7 July 1917, Huon met her five sister ships off the Cocos Islands, with the six vessels sailing to the Mediterranean via Diego Garcia. Huon joined the escort of a convoy from Port Said to Malta, and arrived on 20 August, after which the destroyer was docked for a month-long refit. 12-pounder gun in the Adriatic Sea, circa. 1917 ‚Äì 1918 From October 1917 until April 1918, Huon was based at Brindisi to patrol for Austrian submarines. From 17 April to 16 May, the ship underwent another refit in Malta, then returned to Brisindi. On 9 August 1918, while operating in the Straits of Otranto, Huon collided with sister ship . Huon was sent to Genoa for repairs. While in drydock, the ship was hit by the 1918 flu pandemic: four stokers and a lieutenant died from influenza between late October and early November.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 48 Huon left dockyard hands a day before World War I ended. The six River-class ships made for Portsmouth, with Huon docking for refit on 14 January 1919. Released on 28 February, Huon joined her sister ships and the cruiser for the voyage to Australia. The ships reached Sydney on 21 May. Although not recognised at the time, an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system in 2010 recognised Huons wartime service with the honour \\"Adriatic 1917‚Äì18\\". Huon recommissioned at Sydney on 1 August 1919, and operated in local waters over the course of the next year, including a stint escorting the battlecruiser during the visit of Edward, Prince of Wales in early 1920. The destroyer was placed in reserve in August 1920. Huon was reactivated on 22 April 1921. On 9 February 1922, the destroyer was holed below the waterline in a collision with the submarine . Repairs were successful, but Huon returned to reserve on 31 May.

She entered service in 1999. The minehunter was temporarily deactivated for half of 2006, but reactivated for use as a border protection patrol boat, a role alternated with other members of the class. In 2011, Huon surveyed the waters around Brisbane following the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. In 2013, Huon participated in the International Fleet Review, and became the first minor war vessel to receive the Gloucester Cup. Design and construction In 1993, the Department of Defence issued a request for tender for six coastal minehunters to replace the problematic Bay-class minehunters. The tender was awarded in August 1994 to Australian Defence Industries (ADI) and Intermarine SpA, which proposed a modified Gaeta-class minehunter.

The main armament is a MSI DS30B 30 mm cannon, supplemented by two 0.50 calibre machine guns. The sensor suite includes a Kelvin-Hughes Type 1007 navigational radar, a GEC-Marconi Type 2093M variable-depth minehunting sonar, an AWADI PRISM radar warning and direction-finding system, and a Radamec 1400N surveillance system. Two Wallop Super Barricade decoy launchers are also fitted. For minehunting operations, Huon uses three Riva Calzoni azimuth thrusters to provide a maximum speed of : two are located at the stern, while the third is sited behind the variable-depth sonar. Mines are located with the minehunting sonar, and can be disposed of by the vessel's two Double Eagle mine disposal vehicles, the Oropesa mechanical sweep, the Mini-Dyad magnetic influence sweep, or the towed AMASS influence sweep (which is not always carried). To prevent damage if a mine is detonated nearby, the ships were built with a glass-reinforced plastic, moulded in a single monocoque skin with no ribs or framework. As the ships often work with clearance divers, they are fitted with a small recompression chamber. Huons hull was laid down during September 1994 at the Intermarine SpA Sarzana shipyard in Italy, and was transferred out to ADI's Newcastle facility as deck cargo, arriving on 31 August 1995. Completed in Newcastle, the ship was launched on 25 July 1997 and commissioned on 15 May 1999. Operational history Following the 2003 Defence Capability Review, HMAS Huon and sister ship were slated for deactivation. Huon was deactivated on 23 March 2006, with plans to preserve the minehunter for four years should the need to reactivate the vessel become apparent. Huon was reactivated in the second half of 2006 for use as a patrol boat. As of 2008, Huon and Hawkesbury were taking turns supporting border security operations. In January 2011, Huon was one of three RAN vessels deployed to survey Moreton Bay and the Brisbane River for submerged debris as part of Operation Queensland Flood Assist, the Australian Defence Force response to the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods.

Fort houses were built to provide protection for individual families during the period from 1773 to about 1795 when attacks by Native Americans on the pioneer settlers were common. The Kilgore Fort House was built about 1790 by the Reverend Robert Kilgore, and is the only surviving example of its type in southwest Virginia. The Kilgore Fort House was restored in 1973-74\\\\. There are two stories, with two rooms on each story. The rooms on each floor were separated by a timber partition. The rooms have been arranged so that if they were attacked they could retreat into the next, until a final stand could be made in the northeast room of the second floor. The original building was constructed without windows, but had small openings for gun ports, which feature emphasizes its defensive purpose. The doors were made of heavy timbers and inside held shut with a heavy bar. The house was made of trimmed white oak log timbers, each of which was notched at the end to receive the timber from the adjacent wall. Gaps between timbers were chinked with mud. A large stone fireplace and chimney on the northeast side was provided for cooking and heating. Despite its obvious defensive design, there is no record of the fort house being attacked by Indians. A story persists in the county that Cherokee Indians once camped on the far bank of Copper Creek, but that is unlikely since the far bank is a cliff. The fort house is on a natural crossing on Copper Creek that is still used today. Older residents remember when cars would ford the creek at this spot; at least two bridges, including the current one, have been built here. Unused bridge pilings still exist in the creek. The Kilgore Fort House is also called the Kilgore Fort, but unlike the popular idea of a frontier fort, it had no walls around it. Instead it is simply a log home designed for defense, hence the term fort house.

In some departments, the title of undersheriff is official, while in others, a different official title is used for the second person in charge. For example, in many small departments, the title of chief deputy sheriff is often used for the second in command; however, in some large departments, the undersheriff is second in command and in turn oversees several chief deputies.

Plot Abraxas (Jesse Ventura) and Secundus (Sven- Ole Thorsen), are intergalactic police officers, or Finders, from a planet called Sargacia. Their race is physically similar to humans but with an expanded lifespan; Abraxas has been a Finder for almost 10,000 years. Each Finder is equipped with an Answer Box, which serves as a communicator and scanner. It can also detect any object from a distance based on the object's vibration. When testing for the Anti-Life Equation, the subject being scanned will disintegrate if they do not contain the equation. Secundus wants to access a negative universe which he believes will give him omnipotent powers and make him immortal. To do this he needs the solution to the Anti-Life Equation. He travels to Earth and impregnates the first human female he finds, Sonia Murray (Marjorie Bransfield), simply by holding his hand over her belly. The resulting baby will be the Culmator, a dangerously powerful prodigy able to solve the equation. Only a few minutes later, Sonia gives birth to a boy and names him Tommy. Meanwhile, Abraxas corners Secundus so other Finders can lock onto their location and transport Secundus to the prison planet Tyrannus 7. Abraxas is ordered to kill Sonia before she can give birth, but he can not bring himself to do it and leaves her with Tommy. When Sonia goes home her parents kick her out of their house, seemingly more concerned with the fact that she does not know who the baby's father is than the fact that the baby was conceived and born on the same day. Five years later, Tommy does not speak but does have strange abilities; when he is picked on at school, he makes the bully wet his pants. The school principal (James Belushi) calls Sonia in about this problem, but she refuses to admit that Tommy has problems. Secundus escapes from Tyrannus 7 and teleports to Earth. The Finders send Abraxas right after Secundus with the same technology, but their transport paths cross and their weapons are destroyed. Abraxas chases Secundus, but loses him; Secundus uses the fuse box at an automotive shop to recharge his Answer Box. When the owner confronts him, he uses his Answer Box to test the shop-owner about the Anti-Life Equation. The test causes the owner to explode. Secundus then goes on a rampage, stealing cars, killing innocent people and causing chaos. He continues to scan people, looking for the chosen one who knows the Anti-Life Equation. He is pursued by Abraxas, who is unable to do much as Secundus escapes and finds Sonia's residence. There, he sees the child with one of Sonia's friends, who is currently watching the house while Sonia and Tommy are out at a movie, and tries to test the equation on him. But Abraxas arrives before any harm can be done to the boy and they fight once more. However, Abraxas is stabbed in the stomach and Secundus leaves after saying he will let Abraxas live to see everything destroyed. Sonia returns home with Tommy and finds Abraxas there in the living room. She expresses her anger about being impregnated by Secundus to him, but is convinced by Abraxas to drive somewhere safe with him and Tommy. While en route to meet Maxie, a friend of Sonia's, Abraxas disables his Answer Box in disgust when the Finders order him to kill Tommy. At Maxie's, Abraxas and Sonia grow closer due to their shared goal of protecting Tommy, developing romantic feelings for each other. Meanwhile, Secundus enters the local school and threatens to kill the children one at a time unless someone brings him the Culmator. Upon re-entering the town, Abraxas, Sonia, and Tommy meet up with the police and find Secundus at the school, where he repeats his ultimatum. Abraxas fights Secundus while Tommy flees, but Secundus overpowers Abraxas and chases Tommy down in a stolen car, cornering him in a garage. Pushed to breaking point, Tommy's latent pyrokinetic powers activate, causing much of the garage to catch fire. Abraxas catches up to Secundus and fights him. Secundus warns Abraxas that he cannot kill him because it is against Sargacian law for a Finder to kill another being who is or ever was a Finder, but Abraxas ignores him and uses his Answer Box to scan Secundus himself for the Anti-Life Equation, disintegrating him and putting an end to his rampage. Although Finder Command are willing for Abraxas to return to Sargacia for his next assignment, he decides to stay behind on Earth with Sonia and Tommy in case anyone attempts to exploit the Culmator again.

Warrego, along with sister ships and , were ordered on 6 February 1909; the first ships to be ordered for the Commonwealth Naval Forces, the post-Federation amalgamation of the Australian colonial navies.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 18 Warrego was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, but when she reached launch condition, the destroyer was disassembled and transported to Australia by ship.Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Warrego (I) She was re-laid at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in December 1910.Clark, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, p. 313 The reasoning behind this was to raise the standard of the Australian shipbuilding industry by giving Cockatoo Island hands-on experience in warship construction.Clark, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, pp. 313‚Äì4 The destroyer was launched on 4 April 1911 by the wife of George Pearce, the Minister for Defence. Warrego was completed on 1 June 1912, and was commissioned into the RAN that day. The destroyer's name comes from the Warrego River. Operational history During the early part of the destroyer's career, Warrego operated in Australian waters. At the start of World War I, Warrego was assigned to the Australian force tasked with neutralising German colonies in the region, along with finding and destroying the German East Asia Squadron. On the night of 11 August 1914, Warrego and sister ship were tasked with entering Simpson Harbour at Rabaul to find and lure the German ships into the guns of the battlecruiser , but found no ships in harbour. During late August and early September, the destroyer escorted the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force to New Britain, and was involved in the landing of troops at Kabakaul to capture a nearby wireless station. Apart from a brief docking in Sydney, Warrego remained in the New Guinea area until 5 February 1915, when she was reassigned to patrols along the east coast of Australia. In October, she sailed to Borneo, and carried out patrols in the region until August 1916. In October 1917, Warrego and her five sister ships were assigned to the Mediterranean. Based at Brindisi, the destroyers were assigned to anti-submarine patrols of the Adriatic. Warrego fought at the Second Battle of Durazzo on 2 October 1918, shelling the Austrian port. At the end of the war, Warrego was briefly deployed to the Black Sea before sailing to Gibraltar.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 192 The ship earned two battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Rabaul 1914\\" and \\"Adriatic 1917‚Äì18\\". The six destroyers, accompanying the cruiser , arrived in Darwin on 26 March 1919: Warrego had to tow Parramatta and Yarra into harbour, as they ran out of fuel. On 20 July, Warrego was placed in reserve. Warrego was briefly recommissioned from 17 January to 23 August 1920 for the visit of the Prince of Wales to Australia, then recommissioned again on 27 March 1928 for training purposes.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 192‚Äì3 Decommissioning and fate Warrego was paid off for the final time on 19 April 1928. She was partially disassembled at Cockatoo Island during 1929, then moored at the island for use as an accommodation hulk. On 23 July 1931, the ship sank at her berth (at location https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/maritimeheritageapp/ViewSiteDetail.aspx?siteid=2596) , and had to be broken up with underwater demolition charges.

Because the ET in outer sphere electron transfer occurs between two non-connected species, the electron is forced to move through space from one redox center to the other. Marcus theory The main theory that describes the rates of outer sphere electron transfer was developed by Rudolph A. Marcus in the 1950s. A major aspect of Marcus theory is the dependence of the electron transfer rate on the thermodynamic driving force (difference in the redox potentials of the electron-exchanging sites). For most reactions, the rates increase with increased driving force. A second aspect is that the rate of outer sphere electron-transfer depends inversely on the \\"reorganizational energy.\\" Reorganization energy describes the changes in bond lengths and angles that are required for the oxidant and reductant to switch their oxidation states. This energy is assessed by measurements of the self-exchange rates (see below). Outer sphere electron transfer is the most common type of electron transfer, especially in biochemistry, where redox centers are separated by several (up to about 11) angstroms by intervening protein. In biochemistry, there are two main types of outer sphere ET: ET between two biological molecules or fixed distance electron transfer, in which the electron transfers within a single biomolecule (e.g., intraprotein).S. J. Lippard, J. M. Berg ‚ÄúPrinciples of Bioinorganic Chemistry‚Äù University Science Books: Mill Valley, CA; 1994. . Examples =Self-exchange= Outer sphere electron transfer can occur between chemical species that are identical except for their oxidation state.R. G. Wilkins Kinetics and Mechanism of Reactions of Transition Metal Complexes, 2nd Edition, VCH, Weinheim, 1991. This process is termed self-exchange. An example is the degenerate reaction between the tetrahedral ions permanganate and manganate: :[MnO4]‚àí \\\\+ [Mn*O4]2‚àí ‚Üí [MnO4]2‚àí \\\\+ [Mn*O4]‚àí For octahedral metal complexes, the rate constant for self- exchange reactions correlates with changes in the population of the eg orbitals, the population of which most strongly affects the length of metal- ligand bonds: *For the [Co(bipy)3]+/[Co(bipy)3]2+ pair, self exchange proceeds at 109 M‚àí1s‚àí1. In this case, the electron configuration changes from Co(I): (t2g)6(eg)2 to Co(II): (t2g)5(eg)2. *For the [Co(bipy)3]2+/[Co(bipy)3]3+ pair, self exchange proceeds at 18 M‚àí1s‚àí1. In this case, the electron configuration changes from Co(II): (t2g)5(eg)2 to Co(III): (t2g)6(eg)0. =Iron-sulfur proteins= Outer sphere ET is the basis of the biological function of the iron-sulfur proteins. The Fe centers are typically further coordinated by cysteinyl ligands. The [Fe4S4] electron-transfer proteins ([Fe4S4] ferredoxins) may be further subdivided into low-potential (bacterial-type) and high-potential (HiPIP) ferredoxins. Low- and high-potential ferredoxins are related by the following redox scheme: 500px Because of the small structural differences between the individual redox states, ET is rapid between these clusters.

Vitanza is a Professor of English at Clemson University (South Carolina). He is the former Director of the interdisciplinary- transdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Rhetorics, Communication, and Information Design, which is situated in the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities. Cynthia Haynes, one of VV's students and longtime colleagues, is the new director of RCID. Formerly at University of Texas at Arlington (1982‚Äì2005), Vitanza works in Media and Communication Philosophy, but that work also finds him teaching summer seminars at the European Graduate School (EGS) in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, where he holds the Jean-Francois Lyotard Chair.Victor Vitanza Faculty profile at European Graduate School Previously, he earned his second PhD at EGS under the title \\"Chaste Rape: Sexual Violence, Canon Formation, and Rhetorical Cultures\\" (director, Wolfgang Schirmacher; readers, Alain Badiou and Giorgio Agamben). In 1978-1979, Vitanza received a National Endowment for Humanities Fellowship-in-Residence to work with Richard Emerson Young at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh) on the topic of \\"Rhetorical Invention\\". Other participants included Sharon Bassett, James A. Berlin, Lisa Ede, David Fractenberg, Robert P. Inkster, Charles Kneupper, Sam Watson, Jr., Vickie Winkler, and William Nelson. Other participating colleagues included Peter Becker, Linda Flower, and Janice Lauer, all important figures in the field of Rhetoric and Composition. Vitanza went on to found and publish the quarterly journal PRE/TEXT (1980‚Äìpresent). Along with Cynthia Haynes, Vitanza started the E-journal, Pre/Text: Electra(Lite), and created an on-line forum called Re/Inter/View listserv that currently has over 500 members. The month-long archived discussions hosted a range of figures from rhetoric and composition and elsewhere including Noam Chomsky, Jane Gallop, Sharon Crowley, and Geoffrey Sirc. Cynthia Haynes published an interview with Vitanza that reveals the madness of the method.  Work  Vitanza's work concentrates on histories of rhetorics and specifically on a \\"third sophistic\\" as well as the \\"excluded middle\\". His efforts extend the implications of Gregory Ulmer's electracy to the field of rhetorical historiographies, or what Vitanza calls \\"hysteriography\\" (and later \\"schizography\\"). Vitanza's efforts are to reread and rewrite questions and concepts raised by such theorists and historians as Gilles Deleuze, Samuel Ijsseling, Giorgio Agamben, and Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard. Vitanza deploys these figures to consider and disrupt the role of negation and subjectivity in \\"the\\" history of rhetoric. Negation, Subjectivity, and The History of Rhetoric (1997) is the title of Vitanza's first book. His efforts are large-scale re- assessments of the sense of negation that Kenneth Burke helps define. Vitanza's efforts extend to a reconsideration of other figures important to rhetorical historiography such as Susan Jarrett, Edward Schiappa, and John Poulakos. Through it all, Vitanza seeks a movement from (negative) possibilities and probabilities to (denegated) incompossibilities (counter- factual, co-extensive possibilities). In Vitanza's recent work, he challenges Leibniz's foundational example of using Sextus's rape of Lucretia to ground a conception of \\"the best of all possible worlds\\". Extending Deleuze's re- reading of Leibniz in The Fold and Agamben's sense of \\"decreation\\", Vitanza seeks after all the denegated incompossibilities that result when \\"what happened and what did not happen are returned to their originary unity\\" (Agamben's Potentialities 270). Vitanza's long-term project, according to a description on his website, is entitled Design as Dasein, and it \\"will examine how philosophical and architectural attitudes are represented under the signs of negativity and death\\".

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 7,719, up from 7,264 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Brooksville, previously Pierceville, took on its present name in 1856, to honor and show support for Preston Brooks, a pro-slavery congressman from South Carolina who caned and seriously injured Massachusetts Senator and abolitionist Charles Sumner. Brooksville is home to historic buildings and residences, including the homes of former Florida Governor William Sherman Jennings and football player Jerome Brown. Geography Brooksville is located in east-central Hernando County, north of Tampa and southwest of Ocala. The geographic center of Florida is north- northwest of Brooksville. According to the United States Census Bureau, Brooksville has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.90%, are water. Brooksville was once a major citrus production area and was known as the \\"Home of the Tangerine\\". Demographics As of Census 2010, there were 7,719 people, 3,504 households, and 1,927 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,469.5 people per square mile (567.7/km2). There were 3,504 occupied housing units at an average density of 793.0 per square mile (306.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 78.7% White, 19.1% African American, 1% Native American, 1.2% Asian, 2.1% from other races, and 2.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.6% of the population, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander composed 0.2% of the population. There were 3,220 households, out of which 23.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.9% were married couples living together, 14.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.1% were non- families. 38.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 19.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.14 and the average family size was 2.82. In the city, 22.1% of people were under the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 21.7% from 25 to 44, 18.7% from 45 to 64, and 29.7% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 80.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 76.4 males. Economy =Personal income= The median income for a household in the city was $25,489, and the median income for a family was $31,060. Males had a median income of $29,837 versus $21,804 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,265. About 16.8% of families and 21.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.9% of those under age 18 and 11.5% of those age 65 or over. =Industry= Tourism The city hosted an annual Blueberry Festival in downtown Brooksville until 2017 with music performances that have included Easton Corbin. The Festival has moved to Plant City since. The city has historic homes along brick streets. There is also a Native American outpost in a log cabin, the Brooksville Railroad Depot Museum, and The Hernando Heritage Museum, located in the May-Stringer House. The Historic Brooksville Walking/Driving Tour features many historic homes; a guidebook is available at the City of Brooksville website and at the main library on Howell Avenue. The first annual GET HEALTHY Brooksville Cycling Classic was held in 2010 and attracted cyclists from all over the state. The Brooksville Business Alliance has sponsored the annual Brooksville Founders Week Celebration since 2006.Brooksville Business Alliance - founders week slide show There is a monthly live music performance, antique car show, and other events. History May Stringer House William Sherman Jennings House Judge Willis Russell House Fort DeSoto, established about 1840 to give protection to settlers from Native Americans, was located at the northeastern edge of present-day Brooksville on Croom Road about one-half mile east of U.S. Highway 41. The fort was also a trading post and a regular stop on the Concord stagecoach line which ran from Palatka to Tampa. The fort was built on top of a heavy bed of limestone, a fact which they were unaware of at the time. This made it exceedingly difficult to obtain water, thus causing the location to be abandoned. In the early 1840s the population shifted about to the south, where a settlement formed by the Hope and Saxon families became known as \\"Pierceville\\". About this time, another community about northwest of Pierceville, named \\"Melendez\\", was formed. On September 12, 1842, Seminole Indians attacked the McDaniel party near the community of Chocachatti, south of Brooksville, killing Charlotte (Mrs. Richard) Crum. In 1850 a post office was established at Melendez. In 1854 it was replaced by a post office at Pierceville. Both towns were situated in the area that would become Brooksville. In 1856 the county seat of Hernando County became the newly named town of Brooksville. The name was chosen to honor Preston Brooks, a congressman who had caned abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner nearly to death in 1856 on the floor of the Senate after Sumner gave an anti-slavery speech and disparaged Brooks' uncle, Senator Andrew Butler. The Pierceville post office was renamed \\"Brooksville\\" in 1871. Brooksville was settled by four families: the Howell family which settled the northern part of town; the Jon L. Mays family which settled the eastern part of town; the Hale family on the west; and the Parsons family on the south. The city was incorporated on October 13, 1880. =Slavery, lynchings and discrimination= A study of lynchings recorded in Hernando County in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revealed it had one of the highest per capita rates of violence against blacks in the United States. In Brooksville, the county seat, several African-Americans were killed in the 1870s and 1920s. Arthur St. Clair, a community leader, was murdered in 1877 after he presided over an interracial marriage. After the murder, the investigation was stymied by local actions to prevent bringing to justice the white men accused in his killing. In 1882, there was a brief uprising by blacks, three of whom were killed and many of whom were wounded by whites.. The event actually occurred in 1882.] The 1920s saw a resurgence of Ku Klux Klan activity and lynchings; as a result, many black residents left the area. Brooksville instituted a zoning law segregating neighborhoods in 1948. Schools remained segregated until the late 1960s. One of the most notorious examples of racism in the city was the creation of the \\"Lewis Plantation and Turpentine Still\\", which claimed to show life in African-American rural communities, but in reality contained black residents dressing and acting in grotesque stereotypes as a means of entertaining white tourists. =Depression Era= During the Great Depression, Brooksville suffered from a lack of currency. The school board paid teachers with chits, and Weeks Hardware \\"accepted chickens and sides of bacon\\" as payment. =Recent times= Brooksville is a residential-commercial community. There are several modern medical facilities in the area including Bayfront Health Brooksville, Oak Hill Community Hospital, and Bayfront Health Spring Hill. A campus of Pasco‚ÄìHernando State College is a mile north of the city limits. The business section includes eleven shopping centers, and Brooksville‚ÄìTampa Bay Regional Airport is south of the city. There are three city parks with walking trails, sports, and picnicking facilities, including a nine-hole golf course and a library. The region also offers abundant hunting, fishing, biking, canoeing, kayaking and camping opportunities. Jerome Brown, defensive tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles, graduated from Brooksville's Hernando High School, where he was often seen in the off season running laps around the track. In June 1988, he received praise for his calm demeanor as he helped disperse a group of Ku Klux Klan protesters in his hometown of Brooksville. Brown died on June 25, 1992, at the age of 27, after he lost control of his ZR1 Chevrolet Corvette at high speed and crashed into a palm tree in Brooksville. Both he and his 12-year-old nephew, Gus, were killed in the accident. Brown was buried in Brooksville. In 2000, the Jerome Brown Community Center was opened in Brooksville in memory of Brown. A minor controversy arose in the summer of 2010 when local media and residents brought attention to the origin of the town's name, calling it \\"shameful\\". The suggestion was made that the town should change its name in order to distance itself from its pro- slavery history. The idea was opposed by locals and not entertained by the city council. However, the city's official website did remove a page which discussed the Brooks/Sumner encounter and had cast Brooks in a positive light.

Early life Pettinato's father, Roberto Sr., was a high-ranking corrections officer in the administration of Juan Per√≥n. When a coup deposed Per√≥n in 1955, he and his family took refuge in the embassy of Ecuador, where Roberto Jr. was born. After obtaining a safe conduct and leaving for Ecuador, the family lived in Peru and Chile until allowed to return to Argentina in 1966. Career =Music career= The younger Pettinato became involved in the Argentine rock scene of the late 1970s mostly as a journalist with the El Expreso Imaginario monthly magazine, which he directed from 1980 until its demise in 1982. In parallel, he was the on-and-off saxophonist for the 1980s band Sumo, led by Anglo-Italian Luca Prodan. He has released a free jazz album named Free Jazz Musica Anticomercial, as Robert Pettinato & Now Free Jazz. =Television career= After Prodan's death and the band's dissolution, he started working in television together with Gerardo Sofovich, co-hosting La noche del Domingo in the early 1990s. Later on, he gained popularity by hosting Duro de acostar on Telefe, a midnight talk show modeled after David Letterman's. In the mid-1990s, he attained cult status by co-hosting post-midnight sports and showbiz show Orsai (a deformation of the football term off-side) with Gonzalo Bonadeo on one of Argentina's many sports cable channels. As an actor, he took part in Primicias, a television series produced by Pol-Ka and broadcast by Canal 13. He also hosted TV programs Mira quien canta, Todos al div√°n, Petti en vivo (Canal 9), Un aplauso para el asador (Canal 13), and the ironic Indomables (Am√©rica TV) and Duro de Domar. In March, of 2009 he began Un Mundo Perfecto, a late-night talk show on (Am√©rica TV). Following the unexpected ending of Indomables due to a conflict between the production company PPT and Am√©rica TV, the production renamed and moved the program to Canal 13, where Pettinato (as of October 2006) hosts Duro de Domar. He has hosted since 2004 a FM radio morning show called El Show de la Noticia. Sexual misconduct accusations In February 2018, several women who worked with him, including Karina Mazzoco, Mariela Anchipi, Josefina Pouso, Virginia Godoy, Ursula Vargues and Emilia Claudeville, accused him for sexual harassment and abuse. They stated that he would \\"suck\\" their necks without their permission until he made them cry, and humiliate them in front of other people with whom they worked. The accusers have witnesses who backed up their claims, but can not make a formal complaint before the law due to Argentine laws regarding prescription for the amount of time spent. Pettinato has refused to talk to the media, such as the television program Intrusos, about the accusations. In the aftermath of the accusations, Pettinato left Argentina for Paraguay, alleging that he was going to start a television show in the country, but reports from both countries summarized that Pettinato left Argentina to become a \\"media exile\\" due to the accusations.

The doctrine of absolute state immunity was changed to one of restricted immunity, whereby a foreign state could be sued in the British courts for some certain activities, usually of a commercial nature. In 1998 the defence attempted to use it during Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial, but Lord Nicholls said that the Act flouted a battery of international legislation on human rights abuses to which Britain is a signatory, and would have meant, according to the arguments of Pinochet's legal team, that British law would have protected even Adolf Hitler. In June 2006 the law was used to dismiss an appeal by three Britons (Sandy Mitchell, Les Walker and Ron Jones) and a Canadian (William Sampson) who were convicted and imprisoned for car bombings and illicit alcohol trading in Saudi Arabia. The Law Lords upheld an appeal by the government of Saudi Arabia against the four men who wished to sue the Saudi government for damages relating to alleged torture. Despite the ruling, the four continue to maintain that they were mistreated by Saudi officials both before and after they were jailed in November 2000. They were released from prison in 2003 on royal pardon. In 2017 the Court of Appeal held that the employment rights of two Sudanese embassy workers were within the scope of the EU-derived Working Time Regulations; a decision subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court at UKSC 62. Under UK domestic law, sections 4 and 16 the State Immunity Act 1978 should have operated to protect the embassies‚Äô immunity from actions arising from contracts of employment, thus barring the employees‚Äô claims. However, once it was established that the matter fell within EU law, Article 47 of the Charter, granting the right to a fair trial, gave the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court the power to ‚Äòprotect‚Äô that right to the extent of overriding the inconsistent provisions of the 1978 Act.

Marcus, starting in 1956, to explain the rates of electron transfer reactions - the rate at which an electron can move or jump from one chemical species (called the electron donor) to another (called the electron acceptor). It was originally formulated to address outer sphere electron transfer reactions, in which the two chemical species only change in their charge with an electron jumping (e.g. the oxidation of an ion like Fe2+/Fe3+), but do not undergo large structural changes. It was extended to include inner sphere electron transfer contributions, in which a change of distances or geometry in the solvation or coordination shells of the two chemical species is taken into account (the Fe-O distances in Fe(H2O)2+ and Fe(H2O)3+ are different).Contrary to Marcus' approach the inner sphere electron transfer theory of Noel S. Hush refers to a continuous change of the electron density during transfer along a geometrical coordinate (adiabatic case), and takes also into account the solvent influence as did Marcus. Hush's formulation is known as Marcus-Hush theory.Hush, N.S. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1961, 57,557 For electron transfer reactions without making or breaking bonds Marcus theory takes the place of Eyring's transition state theoryP. W. Atkins: Physical Chemistry, 6. Ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford 1998 p.830R.S. Berry, S. A. Rice, J. Ross: Physical Chemistry, Wiley, New York 1980, S. 1147 ff, which has been derived for reactions with structural changes. Both theories lead to rate equations of the same exponential form. However, whereas in Eyring theory the reaction partners become strongly coupled in the course of the reaction to form a structurally defined activated complex, in Marcus theory they are weakly coupled and retain their individuality. It is the thermally induced reorganization of the surroundings, the solvent (outer sphere) and the solvent sheath or the ligands (inner sphere) which create the geometrically favourable situation prior to and independent of the electron jump. The original classical Marcus theory for outer sphere electron transfer reactions demonstrates the importance of the solvent and leads the way to the calculation of the Gibbs free energy of activation, using the polarization properties of the solvent, the size of the reactants, the transfer distance and the Gibbs free energy \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ of the redox reaction. The most startling result of Marcus' theory was the \\"inverted region\\": whereas the reaction rates usually become higher with increasing exergonicity of the reaction, electron transfer should, according to Marcus theory, become slower in the very negative \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ domain. Scientists searched the inverted region for proof of a slower electron transfer rate for 30 years until it was unequivocally verified experimentally in 1984.Miller J.R., Calcaterra L.T., Closs G.L.: \\"Intramolecular long- distance electron transfer in radical anions. The effects of free energy and solvent on the reaction rates\\", J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1984, 106, 3047, R. A. Marcus received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1992 for this theory. Marcus theory is used to describe a number of important processes in chemistry and biology, including photosynthesis, corrosion, certain types of chemiluminescence, charge separation in some types of solar cells and more. Besides the inner and outer sphere applications, Marcus theory has been extended to address heterogeneous electron transfer.  The one-electron redox reaction  Chemical reactions may lead to a substitution of a group in a molecule or a ligand in a complex, to the elimination of a group of the molecule or a ligand, or to a rearrangement of a molecule or complex. An electron-transfer reaction may, however, also cause simply an exchange of charges between the reactants, and these redox reactions without making or breaking a bond seem to be quite simple in inorganic chemistry for ions and complexes. These reactions often become manifest by a change of colour, e.g. for ions or complexes of transition metal ions, but organic molecules, too, may change their colour by accepting or giving away an electron (like the herbicide Paraquat (N,N-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride) which becomes blue when accepting an electron, thence the alternative name of methyl viologen). For this type of electron-transfer reactions R.A. Marcus has developed his theory. Here the trace of argument and the results are presented. For the mathematical development and details the original papersMarcus, R.A. \\"On the Theory of Oxidation-Reduction Reactions Involving Electron Transfer I\\" J.Chem.Phys.1956, 24, 966. or Free TextMarcus.R.A. \\"Electrostatic Free Energy and Other Properties of States Having Nonequilibrium Polarization I. J.Chem.Phys.1956, 24, 979. or Free Text should be consulted. In a redox reaction one partner acts as an electron donor D the other as an acceptor A. For a reaction to take place D and A must diffuse together. They form the precursor complex, usually a kinetic, unstable, solvated encounter complex, which by electron transfer is transformed to the successor complex, and finally this separates by diffusion. For a one electron transfer the reaction is :{D}+A <=>[k_{12}][k_{21}] [D{\\\\dotsm}A] <=>[k_{23}][k_{32}] [D+{\\\\dotsm}A^-] ->[k_{30}] {D+} + {A^-} (D and A may already carry charges). Here k12, k21 and k30 are diffusion constants, k23 and k32 rate constants of activated reactions. The total reaction may be diffusion controlled (the electron transfer step is faster than diffusion, every encounter leads to reaction) or activation controlled (the \\"equilibrium of association\\" is reached, the electron transfer step is slow, the separation of the successor complex is fast). Outer sphere electron transfer Redox reactions are preferably run in polar solvents. Donor and acceptor then have a solvent shell and the precursor and successor complexes are solvated also. The closest molecules of the solvent shell, or the ligands in complexes, are tightly bound and constitute the \\"inner sphere\\". Reactions in which these participate are called inner sphere redox reactions. The free solvent molecules constitute the \\"outer sphere\\". Outer sphere redox reactions do not change the inner sphere, no bonds are made nor broken. It was R.A. Marcus who realized the role of the solvent when he worked on the nature and magnitude of the Gibbs free energy of activation for redox reactions, more precisely: one-electron transfer reactions of the outer sphere type. He published two fundamental papers. The ideas of these two papers are often referred to Marcus Theory, although Marcus‚Äô later work goes much beyond them.  The problem  In outer sphere redox reactions no bonds are formed or broken; only an electron transfer (ET) takes place. A quite simple example is the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox reaction, the self exchange reaction which is known to be always occurring in an aqueous solution containing both FeSO4 and Fe2(SO4)3 (of course, with equal and measurable rates in both directions and with Gibbs free reaction energy \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ = 0). From the reaction rate's temperature dependence an activation energy is determined, and this activation energy is interpreted as the energy of the transition state in a reaction diagram. The latter is drawn, according to Arrhenius and Eyring, as an energy diagram with the reaction coordinate as the abscissa. The reaction coordinate describes the minimum energy path from the reactants to the products, and the points of this coordinate are combinations of distances and angles between and in the reactants in the course of the formation and/or cleavage of bonds. The maximum of the energy diagram, the transition state, is characterized by a specific configuration of the atoms. Moreover, in Eyring's TST a quite specific change of the nuclear coordinates is responsible for crossing the maximum point, a vibration in this direction is consequently treated as a translation. For outer sphere redox reactions there cannot be such a reaction path, but nevertheless one does observe an activation energy. The rate equation for activation-controlled reactions has the same exponential form as the Eyring equation, : k_\\\\text{act} = A\\\\cdot e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta G^{\\\\ddagger}}{RT}} \\\\Delta G^{\\\\ddagger}is the Gibbs free energy of the formation of the transition state, the exponential term represents the probability of its formation, A contains the probability of crossing from precursor to successor complex.  The Marcus model  The consequence of an electron transfer is the rearrangement of charges, and this greatly influences the solvent environment. For the dipolar solvent molecules rearrange in the direction of the field of the charges (this is called orientation polarisation), and also the atoms and electrons in the solvent molecules are slightly displaced (atomic and electron polarization, respectively). It is this solvent polarization which determines the free energy of activation and thus the reaction rate. Substitution, elimination and isomerization reactions differ from the outer sphere redox reaction not only in the structural changes outlined above, but also in the fact that the movements of the nuclei and the shift of charges (charge transfer, CT) on the reactions path take place in a continuous and concerted way: nuclear configurations and charge distribution are always \\"in equilibrium\\". This is illustrated by the SN2 substitution of the saponification of an alkyl halide where the rear side attack of the OH‚àí ion pushes out a halide ion and where a transition state with a five-coordinated carbon atom must be visualized. The system of the reactants becomes coupled so tightly during the reaction that they form the activated complex as an integral entity. The solvent here has a minor effect. By contrast, in outer sphere redox reactions the displacement of nuclei in the reactants are small, here the solvent has the dominant role. Donor-acceptor coupling is weak, both keep their identity during the reaction. Therefore, the electron, being an elementary particle, can only \\"jump\\" as a whole (electron transfer, ET). If the electron jumps, the transfer is much faster than the movement of the large solvent molecules, with the consequence that the nuclear positions of the reaction partners and the solvent molecules are the same before and after the electron jump (Franck‚ÄìCondon principle).W.F. Libby, \\"Theory of Electron Exchange Reactions in Aqueous Solution\\" J.Phys.Chem. 1952, 56, 863 The jump of the electron is governed by quantum mechanical rules, it is only possible if also the energy of the ET system does not change \\"during\\" the jump. The arrangement of solvent molecules depends on the charge distribution on the reactants. If the solvent configuration must be the same before and after the jump and the energy may not change, then the solvent cannot be in the solvation state of the precursor nor in that of the successor complex as they are different, it has to be somewhere in between. For the self-exchange reaction for symmetry reasons an arrangement of the solvent molecules exactly in the middle of those of precursor and successor complex would meet the conditions. This means that the solvent arrangement with half of the electron on both donor and acceptor would be the correct environment for jumping. Also, in this state the energy of precursor and successor in their solvent environment would be the same. However, the electron as an elementary particle cannot be divided, it resides either on the donor or the acceptor and arranges the solvent molecules accordingly in an equilibrium. The \\"transition state\\", on the other hand, requires a solvent configuration which would result from the transfer of half an electron, which is impossible. This means that real charge distribution and required solvent polarization are not in an \\"equilibrium\\". Yet it is possible that the solvent takes a configuration corresponding to the \\"transition state\\", even if the electron sits on the donor or acceptor. This, however, requires energy. This energy may be provided by the thermal energy of the solvent and thermal fluctuations can produce the correct polarization state. Once this has been reached the electron can jump. The creation of the correct solvent arrangement and the electron jump are decoupled and do not happen in a synchronous process. Thus the energy of the transition state is mostly polarization energy of the solvent.  Marcus theory  = The macroscopic system: two conducting spheres = On the basis of his reasoning R.A. Marcus developed a classical theory with the aim of calculating the polarization energy of the said non- equilibrium state. From thermodynamics it is well known that the energy of such a state can be determined if a reversible path to that state is found. Marcus was successful in finding such a path via two reversible charging steps for the preparation of the \\"transition state\\" from the precursor complex. Four elements are essential for the model on which the theory is based: # Marcus employs a classical, purely electrostatic model. The charge (many elementary charges) may be transferred in any portion from one body to another. # Marcus separates the fast electron polarisation Pe and the slow atom and orientation polarisation Pu of the solvent on grounds of their time constants differing several orders of magnitude. # Marcus separates the inner sphere (reactant + tightly bound solvent molecules, in complexes + ligands) and the outer sphere (free solvent ) # In this model Marcus confines himself to calculating the outer sphere energy of the non-equilibrium polarization of the \\"transition state\\". The outer sphere energy is often much larger than the inner sphere contribution because of the far reaching electrostatic forces (compare the Debye-H√ºckel theory of electrochemistry). Marcus‚Äô tool is the theory of dielectric polarization in solvents. He solved the problem in a general way for a transfer of charge between two bodies of arbitrary shape with arbitrary surface and volume charge. For the self-exchange reaction, the redox pair (e.g. Fe(H2O)63+ / Fe(H2O)62+) is substituted by two macroscopic conducting spheres at a defined distance carrying specified charges. Between these spheres a certain amount of charge is reversibly exchanged. In the first step the energy WI of the transfer of a specific amount of charge is calculated, e.g. for the system in a state when both spheres carry half of the amount of charge which is to be transferred. This state of the system can be reached by transferring the respective charge from the donor sphere to the vacuum and then back to the acceptor sphere.Marcus takes the vacuum state of the reactants as the zero energy point. Therefore many of his equations contain also the solvation energy of the isolated species Wiso and the electrostatic energy of formation of the precursor and successor complexes. Then the spheres in this state of charge give rise to a defined electric field in the solvent which creates the total solvent polarization Pu \\\\+ Pe. By the same token this polarization of the solvent interacts with the charges. In a second step the energy WII of the reversible (back) transfer of the charge to the first sphere, again via the vacuum, is calculated. However, the atom and orientation polarization Pu is kept fixed, only the electron polarization Pe may adjust to the field of the new charge distribution and the fixed Pu. After this second step the system is in the desired state with an electron polarization corresponding to the starting point of the redox reaction and an atom and orientation polarization corresponding to the \\"transition state\\". The energy WI \\\\+ WII of this state is, thermodynamically speaking, a Gibbs free energy G. Fig. 1. The parabolas of outer-sphere reorganisation energy of the system two spheres in a solvent. Parabola i: the charge on the first, transfer to the second, parabola f: the charge on the second, transfer to the first. The abscissa is the transferred amount of charge Œîe or the induced polarization P, the ordinate the Gibbs free energy. ŒîG(0)‚Ä° = Œªo/4 is the reorganization energy at Œîe = 0.5, it corresponds to the activation energy of the self-exchange reaction. Of course, in this classical model the transfer of any arbitrary amount of charge Œîe is possible. So the energy of the non-equilibrium state, and consequently of the polarization energy of the solvent, can be probed as a function of Œîe. Thus Marcus has lumped together, in a very elegant way, the coordinates of all solvent molecules into a single coordinate of solvent polarization Œîp which is determined by the amount of transferred charge Œîe. So he reached a simplification of the energy representation to only two dimensions: G = f(Œîe). The result for two conducting spheres in a solvent is the formula of Marcus : G =\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2r_{1}}+\\\\frac{1}{2r_2}-\\\\frac{1}{R}\\\\right)\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon_\\\\text{opt}}-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon_\\\\text{s}}\\\\right)\\\\cdot(\\\\Delta e)^2 Where r1 and r2 are the radii of the spheres and R is their separation, Œµs and Œµopt are the static and high frequency (optical) dielectric constants of the solvent, Œîe the amount of charge transferred. The graph of G vs. Œîe is a parabola (Fig. 1). In Marcus theory the energy belonging to the transfer of a unit charge (Œîe = 1) is called the (outer sphere) reorganization energy Œªo, i.e. the energy of a state where the polarization would correspond to the transfer of a unit amount of charge, but the real charge distribution is that before the transfer.Note: The quadratic dependence of outer sphere reorganization energy is not a consequence of vibrations in reactants or solvent! In terms of exchange direction the system is symmetric. = The microscopic system: the donor-acceptor pair = Shrinking the two-sphere model to the molecular level creates the problem that in the self-exchange reaction the charge can no longer be transferred in arbitrary amounts, but only as a single electron. However, the polarization still is determined by the total ensemble of the solvent molecules and therefore can still be treated classically, i.e. the polarization energy is not subject to quantum limitations. Therefore, the energy of solvent reorganization can be calculated as being due to a hypothetical transfer and back transfer of a partial elementary charge according to the Marcus formula. Thus the reorganization energy for chemical redox reactions, which is a Gibbs free energy, is also a parabolic function of Œîe of this hypothetical transfer, For the self exchange reaction, where for symmetry reasons Œîe = 0.5, the Gibbs free energy of activation is ŒîG(0)‚Ä° = Œªo/4 (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 intersection of the parabolas I and f, f(0), respectively). Up to now all was physics, now some chemistry enters. The self exchange reaction is a very specific redox reaction, most of the redox reactions are between different partnersthey are often called Marcus cross reactions. e.g. :{[Fe^{II}(CN)6]^{4-}}+{[Ir^{IV}Cl6]^{2-}}<=>{[Fe^{III}(CN)6]^{3-}}+{[Ir^{III}Cl6]^{3-}} and they have positive (endergonic) or negative (exergonic) Gibbs free energies of reaction \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ. As Marcus calculations refer exclusively to the electrostatic properties in the solvent (outer sphere) \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ and \\\\lambda_0 are independent of one another and therefore can just be added up. This means that the Marcus parabolas in systems with different \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ are shifted just up or down in the G vs. \\\\Delta e diagram (Fig. 2). Variation of \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ can be affected in experiments by offering different acceptors to the same donor. Simple calculations of the points of intersection of the parabolas i, (y = x^2), f^{(0)}, (y = (x-d)^2) and f_1 to f_3 (y = (x-d)^2+c) give the Gibbs free energy of activation :\\\\Delta G^{\\\\ddagger} = \\\\frac{(\\\\lambda_{0} + \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ)^2}{4 \\\\lambda_{0}} The intersection of those parabolas represents an activation energy and not the energy of a transition state of fixed configuration of all nuclei in the system as is the case in the substitution and other reactions mentioned. The transition state of the latter reactions has to meet structural and energetic conditions, redox reactions have only to comply to the energy requirement. Whereas the geometry of the transition state in the other reactions is the same for all pairs of reactants, for redox pairs many polarization environments may meet the energetic conditions. Fig. 2 Marcus-Parabolas for different redox reactions: f1 such with positive \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ, f(0) for the self-exchange reaction with \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ= 0 (broken line), f_2 for moderately negative \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ (selected so, that \\\\Delta G^\\\\ddagger= 0) and f_3 for strongly negative \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ. The free energy of activation \\\\Delta G^\\\\ddagger decreases from f_1 (b_1) via f(0) (a) to f_2 (zero) and increases again for f_3 (\\"Marcus inverted region\\"). Marcus‚Äô formula shows a quadratic dependence of the Gibbs free energy of activation on the Gibbs free energy of reaction. It is general knowledge from the host of chemical experience that reactions usually are the faster the more negative is \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ. In many cases even a linear free energy relation is found. According to the Marcus formula the rates increase also when the reactions are more exergonic, however only as long as \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ is positive or slightly negative. It is surprising that for redox reactions according to the Marcus formula the activation energy should increase for very exergonic reaction, i.e. in the cases when \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ is negative and its absolute value is greater than that of \\\\lambda_0. This realm of Gibbs free energy of reaction is called \\"Marcus inverted region\\". In Fig. 2 it becomes obvious that the intersection of the parabolas i and f moves upwards in the left part of the graph when \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ continues to become more negative, and this means increasing activation energy. Thus the total graph of \\\\ln k vs. \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ should have a maximum. The maximum of the ET rate is expected at \\\\Delta G^\\\\ddagger= 0. Here \\\\Delta e = 0 and q = 0 (Fig. 2) which means that the electron may jump in the precursor complex at its equilibrium polarization. No thermal activation is necessary: the reaction is barrierless. In the inverted region the polarization corresponds to the difficult to imagine notion of a charge distribution where the donor has received and the acceptor given off charge. Of course, in real world this does not happen, it is not a real charge distribution which creates this critical polarization, but the thermal fluctuation in the solvent. This polarization necessary for transfer in the inverted region can be created ‚Äì with some probability ‚Äì as well as any other one.The reverse reaction may support understanding: for this reaction the polarization due to the hypothetical transfer of a unit electron charge is not sufficient to reach a polarization where the polarization energies of A/D and A‚àí/D+ are equal. This can only happen on the hypothetical transfer of more that one electron charge. The electron is just waiting for it for jumping. Inner sphere electron transfer In the outer sphere model the donor or acceptor and the tightly bound solvation shells or the complex‚Äô ligands were considered to form rigid structures which do not change in the course of electron transfer. However, the distances in the inner sphere are dependent on the charge of donor and acceptor, e.g. the central ion-ligand distances are different in complexes carrying different charges and again the Franck‚ÄìCondon principle must be obeyed: for the electron to jump to occur, the nuclei have to have a configuration which is an identical one of as well the precursor as the successor complexes, of course highly distorted. In this case the energy requirement is fulfilled automatically. In this inner sphere case the Arrhenius concept holds, the transition state of definite geometric structure is reached along a geometrical reaction coordinate determined by nuclear motions. No further nuclear motion is necessary to form the successor complex, just the electron jumps, which makes a difference to the TST theory. The reaction coordinate for inner sphere energy is governed by vibrations and they differ in the oxidized and reduces species.N. Sutin, 'Theory of Electron Transfer Reactions: Insights and Hindsights', Progr. Inorg. Chem. 1083, 30, 441-448 For the self-exchange system Fe2+/Fe3+ only the symmetrical breathing vibration of the six water molecules around the iron ions is considered. Assuming harmonic conditions this vibration has frequencies u_D and u_A, the force constants fD and fA are f = 4 \\\\pi^2 u^2 \\\\mu and the energies are :\\\\begin{align} E_D &= E_D(q_{0,D}) + 3 f_D(\\\\Delta q_D)^2 E_A &= E_A(q_{0,A}) + 3 f_A(\\\\Delta q_A)^2 \\\\end{align} where q0 is the equilibrium normal coordinate and \\\\Delta q = (q-q_0) the displacement along the normal coordinate, the factor 3 stems from 6 (H2O)*¬Ω. Like for the outer-sphere reorganization energy potential energy curve is quadratic, here, however, as a consequence of vibrations. The equilibrium normal coordinates differ in Fe(H2O)62+ and Fe(H2O)63+. By thermal excitation of the breathing vibration a geometry can be reached which is common to both donor and acceptor, i.e. the potential energy curves of the breathing vibrations of D and A intersect here. This is the situation where the electron may jump. The energy of this transition state is the inner sphere reorganization energy Œªin. For the self- exchange reaction the metal-water distance in the transition state can be calculated : q^*=\\\\frac{f_D q_{0,D} + f_A q_{0,A}}{f_D + f_A} This gives the inner sphere reorganisation energy : \\\\lambda_{in} = \\\\Delta E^* = \\\\frac{3 f_D f_A}{f_D + f_A}(q_{0,D} - q_{0,A})^2 It is fortunate that the expressions for the energies for outer and inner reorganization have the same quadratic form. Inner sphere and outer sphere reorganization energies are independent, so they can be added to give \\\\lambda = \\\\lambda_{in} + \\\\lambda_o and inserted in the Arrhenius equation : k_{act} = A \\\\cdot e^{- \\\\frac{ \\\\Delta {G_{in}^{\\\\ddagger}}+ \\\\Delta {G_{o}}^{\\\\ddagger}}{kT}} Here, A can be seen to represent the probability of electron jump, that of reaching the transition state of the inner sphere and that of outer sphere adjustment. For unsymmetrical (cross) reactions like :{[Fe(H2O)6]^2+} + {[Co(H2O)6]^3+} <=> {[Fe(H2O)6]^3+} + {[Co(H2O)6]^2+} the expression for \\\\lambda_{in} can also be derived, but it is more complicated. These reactions have a free reaction enthalpy ŒîG0 which is independent of the reorganization energy and determined by the different redox potentials of the iron and cobalt couple. Consequently, the quadratic Marcus equation holds also for the inner sphere reorganization energy, including the prediction of an inverted region. One may visualizing this by (a) in the normal region both the initial state and the final state have to have stretched bonds, (b) In the Œî G‚Ä° = 0 case the equilibrium configuration of the initial state is the stretched configuration of the final state, and (c) in the inverted region the initial state has compressed bonds whereas the final state has largely stretched bonds. Similar considerations hold for metal complexes where the ligands are larger than solvent molecules and also for ligand bridged polynuclear complexes. The probability of the electron jump The strength of the electronic coupling of the donor and acceptor decides whether the electron transfer reaction is adiabatic or non-adiabatic. In the non-adiabatic case the coupling is weak, i.e. HAB in Fig. 3 is small compared to the reorganization energy and donor and acceptor retain their identity. The system has a certain probability to jump from the initial to the final potential energy curves. In the adiabatic case the coupling is considerable, the gap of 2 HAB is larger and the system stays on the lower potential energy curve.In normal chemical reactions, like substitutions, which proceed via a transition state the upper potential energy curve is so far up that it is neglected Marcus theory as laid out above, represents the non-adiabatic case.The theory of adiabatic electron transfer with participation of nuclear movement (which may be considered as a transfer of charge, not an electron jump), has been worked out by Hush. Consequently, the semi-classical Landau- Zener theory can be applied, which gives the probability of interconversion of donor and acceptor for a single passage of the system through the region of the intersection of the potential energy curves : P_{if} = 1-\\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\frac{4\\\\pi^2 {H_{if}^2}}{hv \\\\mid(s_i - s_f)\\\\mid}\\\\right] where Hif is the interaction energy at the intersection, v the velocity of the system through the intersection region, si and sf the slopes there. Image:Parameters of the Marcus Equation.JPG Fig. 3 Energy diagram for Electron Transfer including inner and outer sphere reorganization and electronic coupling: The vertical axis is the free energy, and the horizontal axis is the \\"reaction coordinate\\" ‚Äì a simplified axis representing the motion of all the atomic nuclei (inclusive solvent reorganization) Working this out, one arrives at the basic equation of Marcus theory :k_{et} = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\hbar}H_{AB}^2 \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi \\\\lambda k_BT}}\\\\exp \\\\left ( -\\\\frac{(\\\\lambda +\\\\Delta G^\\\\circ)^2}{4\\\\lambda k_BT} \\\\right ) where k_{et} is the rate constant for electron transfer, H_{AB} is the electronic coupling between the initial and final states, \\\\lambda is the reorganization energy (both inner and outer- sphere), and \\\\Delta G^\\\\circ is the total Gibbs free energy change for the electron transfer reaction (k_B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature). Thus Marcus's theory builds on the traditional Arrhenius equation for the rates of chemical reactions in two ways: 1\\\\. It provides a formula for the activation energy, based on a parameter called the reorganization energy, as well as the Gibbs free energy. The reorganization energy is defined as the energy required to \\"reorganize\\" the system structure from initial to final coordinates, without making the charge transfer. 2\\\\. It provides a formula for the pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius equation, based on the electronic coupling between the initial and final state of the electron transfer reaction (i.e., the overlap of the electronic wave functions of the two states).  Experimental results  Marcus published his theory in 1956. For many years there was an intensive search for the inverted region which would be a proof of the theory. But all experiments with series of reactions of more and more negative ŒîG0 revealed only an increase of the reaction rate up to the diffusion limit, i.e. to a value indicating that every encounter lead to electron transfer, and that limit held also for very negative ŒîG0 values (Rehm-Weller behaviour).Rehm, D., Weller, A. \\"Kinetik und Mechanismus der Elektronen√ºbertragung bei der Fluoreszenzl√∂schung in Acetonitril\\" Ber. Bunsenges.Physik.Chem. 1969, 73, 834-839 characterized this behaviour by the empirical formula \\\\Delta G^{\\\\ddagger} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta G^0}{2}+\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta G^{\\\\ddagger}(0)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta G^0}{2}\\\\right)^2} It took about 30 years until the inverted region was unequivocally substantiated by Miller, Calcaterra and Closs for an intramolecular electron transfer in a molecule where donor and acceptor are kept at a constant distance by means of a stiff spacer (Fig.4).Miller J.R., Calcaterra L.T., Closs G.L.: \\"Intramolecular long-distance electron transfer in radical anions. The effects of free energy and solvent on the reaction rates\\", J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1984, 106, 3047, Fig.4. Marcus behaviour in a molecule, which is composed of a biphenyl entity, whose anion (produced by means of pulse radiolysis) acts as a donor, a steroid entity, which is a rigid spacer and different aromatic hydrocarbons (1‚àí3) and quinones (4‚àí8), which are the acceptors.We recommend reference to the original paper, JACS does not license Wikipedia for graphs. A posteriori one may presume that in the systems where the reaction partners may diffuse freely the optimum distance for the electron jump may be sought, i.e. the distance for which ŒîG‚Ä° = 0 and ŒîG0 = - Œªo. For Œªo is dependent on R, Œªo increases for larger R and the opening of the parabola smaller. It is formally always possible to close the parabola in Fig. 2 to such an extent, that the f-parabola intersects the i-parabola in the apex. Then always ŒîG‚Ä° = 0 and the rate k reaches the maximum diffusional value for all very negative ŒîG0. There are, however, other concepts for the phenomenon, e.g. the participation of excited states or that the decrease of the rate constants would be so far in the inverted region that it escapes measurement. R. A. Marcus and his coworkers have further developed the theory outlined here in several aspects. They have included inter alia statistical aspects and quantum effects,Siders, P., Marcus, R.

Early life Ivor Dent was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan on February 7, 1924. During World War II, he attempted to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force, but was rejected. He subsequently took work as an office boy for Canadian Pacific until he was accepted to the air force a year later; he served as a bombardier for three years. After the war, he married his wife, Aileen, in 1948 while he was studying science at the University of Saskatchewan; the couple would have four children. Ivor Dent graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in science in 1949. Three years later, he and his wife moved to Edmonton and Dent enrolled at the University of Alberta, from which he earned a Bachelor of Education. After earning his second degree, he moved to Enchant, Alberta, where he taught for a year before returning to Edmonton to teach. He earned his third university degree, a Master of Administration, from the University of Alberta in 1956 and continued to teach. Early political career Dent's first bid for office took place during the 1955 Alberta election, when he ran in Edmonton for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. He placed twenty-fifth of thirty candidates in the first ballot (the multi-seat constituency used a single transferable vote electoral system at the time) and was eliminated from contention on subsequent ballots. Dent turned his attention to municipal politics; In the 1957 municipal election, he ran for alderman on Edmonton City Council. He finished seventh out of nineteen, falling short of the top five placing needed to be elected. Efforts during the 1959 and 1960 elections (in which he placed tenth of seventeen and eighth of fifteen, respectively) were similarly unsuccessful, and Dent took a two-year hiatus from politics, to earn his doctorate in educational administration from the University of Oregon. Upon his return to Edmonton, he took up a position as a school vice principal. He ran for the leadership of the newly formed Alberta New Democratic Party in January 1962, losing to Neil Reimer, but was elected party president. Dent ran in the 1963 federal election in Edmonton East for the New Democratic Party. He finished fourth of five candidates, defeating only Communist W.A. Tuomi, as incumbent Progressive Conservative William Skoreyko was handily re-elected. Dent was finally elected to office in the 1963 municipal election, when he was elected to a one-year aldermanic term (he placed fourth of sixteen). He was re-elected to a two-year term in the 1964 municipal election, in which he placed fifth of forty-six candidates, and in the 1966 election, in which he placed second out of forty-four candidates. Mayor After five years as an alderman, Dent ran for mayor in the 1968 election, in which he defeated his fellow aldermen Reginald Easton and John Leslie Bodie in a close three-way race (he was the first mayor elected to a three-year, rather than a two-year, term). He was re-elected in 1971, when he survived a challenge from alderman Julian Kinisky, but his second term didn't go as smoothly as the first. A damaging transit strike cost Dent support from all sides. In the 1974 election, Dent faced credible challenges from former mayor William Hawrelak (who had returned to municipal politics after vowing never to do so) and alderman Cec Purves. He wound up losing to both of them, as Hawrelak was elected and Dent relegated to third place in a seven candidate field. Although he was out of office by the time they occurred, Dent is credited by many with bringing the 1978 Commonwealth Games to Edmonton. Further elections, awards, and retirement After his defeat, Dent went to Oxford University to study public administration. Upon his return to Canada, he became the principal of Rundle Elementary School, where he stayed until his retirement in 1980. In 1995 he joined the Board of Directors of SOS Children's Villages Canada until 2001. He attempted to reclaim his old office in the 1977 election, but finished in fourth place after the victor Purves, alderman Laurence Decore (himself a future mayor), and Terry Cavanagh (the alderman Council had selected to complete the deceased Hawrelak's term). He would not return to municipal politics, but ran in a 1986 federal by-election in Pembina for the New Democratic Party. Although he entered the race as the favourite, he was narrowly defeated by Progressive Conservative Walter van de Walle. He was admitted as a Member to the Order of Canada in 1984, and was awarded the Alberta Centennial Medal in 2005. He was defeated in a 1990 bid for the chairmanship of the Commonwealth Games Federation. Death On March 29, 2009 Ivor Dent died from Alzheimer's disease.

Its construction is similar to the larger bandora and an ancestor of the guitar. The metal strings are tuned like a lute and are plucked with the fingers. The nut and bridge of an orpharion are typically sloped, so that the string length increases from treble to bass. Due to the extremely low-tension metal strings, which would easily distort the notes when pushed down, the frets were almost flush with the fingerboard, which was gently scalloped.\\"Orpheoreon\\" in Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1946). As with all metal-strung instruments of the era, a very light touch with the plucking hand was required, quite different from the sharper attack used on the lute. Picture of an Orpharion by John Rose used in the frontispiece for William Barley's Book of Tablature 1596 The orpharion was invented in England in the second half of the 16th century; in sources of English music it is often mentioned as an alternative to the lute. According to Stow's \\"Annals\\" (1631), John Rose of Bridewell invented the instrument in 1581. A Rose orpharion in Helmingham Hall was allegedly given as a gift to Queen Elizabeth, and may well be that first example. It has six courses and the bridge and nut are parallel. The only other surviving orpharion, now in the Claudius Collection in Copenhagen, has nine courses with sloping frets, and dates to 1617. The name orpharion comes from Orpheus and Arion. William Barley published a book of Orpharian tablature in 1596. It contained music by Francis Cutting, John Dowland, Philip Rosseter, Peter Philips, Anthony Holborne, Edward Johnson and William Byrd. It was entitled A new book of tablature for the orpharion, containing sundry sorts of lessons, collected together [by William Barley] out of diverse good authors, for the furtherance and delight of such as are desirous to practise on this instrument.

At age 76 in 2006, he became the second-oldest inmate at the time to be executed in the United States since 1976, after John B. Nixon, who was executed in Mississippi in December 2005 at age 77. Pro-death penalty activists cite Allen's actions as a reason to support capital punishment in the United States. He was already serving a life sentence for one murder when he was convicted of organizing the killing of three more people. While in prison, Allen acknowledged his Native American Choctaw heritage. He also claimed to be deaf, blind and severely disabled, requiring a wheelchair for mobility. He did not know any sign language to communicate with hearing people. During his execution, he was able to walk from his wheelchair to the death podium unassisted. In addition, he appeared to be looking straight at his family prior to receiving the first dose of drugs during his lethal injection procedure. Allen had a confirmed advanced case of type 2 diabetes, and he suffered a heart attack on September 2, 2005. His lawyers declared that \\"he presents absolutely no danger at this point, as incapacitated as he is. There's no legitimate state purpose served by executing him. It would be gratuitous punishment.\\" They argued that his execution would constitute cruel and unusual punishment and requested that he be granted clemency by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, which was refused. Murder of Mary Sue Kitts In 1974, Allen plotted the burglary of Fran's Market, a Fresno-area supermarket owned by Ray and Fran Schletewitz, whom Allen had known for years. The plot involved his son, Roger Allen, as well as Ed Savala, Carl Mayfield, and Charles Jones. Mayfield and Jones worked for Clarence Ray Allen in his security guard business as well as part of a burglary enterprise allegedly operated by Allen. As part of the burglary plot against Fran's Market, he arranged for someone to steal a set of door and alarm keys from the market owner's son, Bryon Schletewitz, age 19, while Schletewitz was swimming in Allen's pool. Allen then arranged a date between Schletewitz and Mary Sue Kitts (his son Roger's girlfriend) for the evening, during which time the burglary took place. The burglary netted $500 in cash and $10,000 in money orders from the store's safe. Following the commission of the burglary, Kitts told Bryon Schletewitz that Allen had committed the crime, which she knew as she had helped Allen cash money orders that had been stolen from the store. Schletewitz confronted Roger Allen, informing him that he had been told of the crime by Kitts, and Roger Allen admitted the crime. When Roger Allen told his father Clarence of Bryon's accusation, Clarence Allen stated that they (Schletewitz and Kitts) would have to be \\"dealt with.\\" He enlisted three employees of his security firm, Charles Jones, Carl Mayfield, and Lee Furrow. According to an opinion filed on May 6, 2004, in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals: :Allen called a meeting at his house and told Jones, Mayfield, and Furrow that Kitts had been talking too much and should be killed. Allen called for a vote on the issue of Kitts's execution. The vote was unanimous because those present feared what would happen if they did not go along with Allen's plan. Allen had previously told his criminal accomplices that he would kill snitches and that he had friends and connections to do the job for him even if he were in prison. He had also referred to himself as a Mafia hitman and stated that the \\"secret witness program\\" was useless because a good lawyer could always discover an informant's name and address. Allen kept a newspaper article about the murder of a man and woman in Nevada, and claimed he had \\"blown them in half\\" with a shotgun. Allen then ordered the murder of Kitts by Lee Furrow. After an unsuccessful attempt to poison her with cyanide capsules, Allen called Furrow to learn if he had killed Kitts. Furrow told Allen he was in the process of strangling her and Allen replied, \\"do it.\\" After killing Kitts, Furrow threw her body into the Friant-Kern Canal. The body has never been found. Execution at Fran's Market While in Folsom Prison, Allen conspired with fellow inmate Billy Ray Hamilton to murder the various witnesses who had testified against him, including Bryon Schletewitz. Allen intended to obtain a new trial, where there would be no witnesses to testify to his acts. After Hamilton was paroled from Folsom Prison, he carried out Allen's orders. On September 5, 1980, Hamilton and his girlfriend, Connie Barbo, went to Fran's Market, east of Fresno, California. Bryon Schletewitz, the son of the market's owner, worked at the market. There, Hamilton murdered Schletewitz and fellow employees Josephine Rocha, 17, and Douglas White, 18, with a sawed-off shotgun and wounded two other people, Joe Rios and Jack Abbott. Hamilton shot Schletewitz at near point-blank range in the forehead and then killed Rocha and White after forcing them to lie on the floor of the store. Rios, also an employee of the market, was shot as well but raised his arm as Hamilton fired on him and this action undoubtedly saved his life. The other wounded survivor, Abbott, was a neighbor who heard the shotgun blasts, came to the market to investigate, and was also shot by Hamilton. Abbott returned fire and wounded Hamilton, who escaped from the scene. Five days after the events at Fran's Market, Hamilton was arrested while attempting to rob a liquor store. On his person was found a \\"hit list\\" with the names and addresses of the witnesses who testified against Allen at his trial for Kitts' murder; Bryon Schletewitz was on the list. Legal proceedings In 1980, the California Attorney General filed charges against Allen and prosecuted the trial in Glenn County, California, due to a change of venue. The trial took place in 1982 and lasted 23 days, and 58 witnesses were called to testify.'Allen v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 979, 989-990, ' Ultimately, the jury convicted Allen of triple murder and conspiracy to murder eight witnesses. As special circumstances making Allen eligible for the death penalty, the jury also found that Allen had previously been convicted of murder, had committed multiple murders, and had murdered witnesses in retaliation for their prior testimony and to prevent future testimony. During a seven-day penalty phase, the Attorney General introduced evidence of Allen's career orchestrating violent robberies in the Central Valley, including ten violent crimes and six prior felony convictions. The jury returned a unanimous verdict of death, and the Glenn County Superior Court sentenced Allen on November 22, 1980. In 1987, the California Supreme Court affirmed Allen's death sentence. Associate Justice Joseph Grodin's opinion referred to Allen's crimes as \\"sordid events\\" with an \\"extraordinarily massive amount\\" of aggravating evidence. In a dissenting opinion, California Supreme Court Justice Broussard stated that the prosecutor influenced the jury by telling them that \\"if you conclude that aggravating evidence outweighs the mitigating evidence, you shall return a death sentence,\\" while the law does not mandate a death sentence in such a situation. According to Justice Broussard, this led to a lack of freedom for the jury to make a \\"normative decision.\\" In 2005, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that Allen's trial counsel had been inadequate, and the evidence against him was largely the testimony of Allen's several accomplices, who painted him as the mastermind who forced them by threats and scare tactics to commit robberies and murders. However the court denied rehearing in Allen's case. In her opinion for the panel, Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw concluded: : Evidence of Allen's guilt is overwhelming. Given the nature of his crimes, sentencing him to another life term would achieve none of the traditional purposes underlying punishment. Allen continues to pose a threat to society, indeed to those very persons who testified against him in the Fran's Market triple-murder trial here at issue, and has proven that he is beyond rehabilitation. He has shown himself more than capable of arranging murders from behind bars. If the death penalty is to serve any purpose at all, it is to prevent the very sort of murderous conduct for which Allen was convicted. Deputy California Attorney General Ward Campbell stated in an interview: : Well, Mr. Allen has cited his age, the length of time on death row, claims about innocence, errors at his trial. We found and told the governor we found all those reasons to be unpersuasive given the nature of his crime, which was in fact a direct attack on the criminal justice system perpetrated by a man whom Society thought to be safe from. They thought they were safe from him because he was behind bars and yet he continued to perpetrate these types of crimes and none of the factors that they cite now overshadow or outbalance those reasons for now executing the judgment of the people of the State of California. On January 13, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to grant Allen clemency, stating that \\"his conduct did not result from youth or inexperience, but instead resulted from the hardened and calculating decisions of a mature man.\\" Schwarzenegger also cited a poem in which Allen glorified his actions, where Allen wrote, \\"We rob and steal and for those who squeal are usually found dying or dead.\\" On January 15, 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Allen's claim that executing an aged or infirm person was cruel and unusual punishment, observing that his mental acuity was unimpaired and that he had been fifty years of age when he arranged the murders from prison. Judge Kim Wardlaw writing for the panel of judges Susan Graber, Richard Clifton, and herself: : His age and experience only sharpened his ability to coldly calculate the execution of the crime. Nothing about his current ailments reduces his culpability and thus they do not lessen the retributive or deterrent purposes of the death penalty. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case, albeit over the dissent of Justice Stephen Breyer, who stated: \\"I believe that in the circumstances he raises a significant question as to whether his execution would constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\\" 1983 Chino Hills murders Kevin Cooper was convicted of the 1983 murder of a family in Chino Hills.

He became the second-oldest inmate to be executed in the United States since 1976 (John B. Nixon of Mississippi was executed in 2005 at age 77). He was the most recently executed inmate in California as of March 2019 when the imposition of the death penalty was suspended in the state by Governor Gavin Newsom.Shafer, Scott and Lagos, Marissa (12 March 2019). \\"Gov. Gavin Newsom Suspends Death Penalty In California\\" NPR (from KQED radio). Retrieved 21 January 2020. Allen was assisted in the death chamber by four correctional officers, though a media observer stated that he was clearly moving under his own power. To the surprise of everyone present, the warden indicated that he needed an additional injection of the lethal potassium in order to stop his surprisingly healthy heart. Allen wrote in his final statement, which Warden Steven Ornoski read immediately following the execution, \\"My last words will be 'Hoka hey, it's a good day to die. Thank you very much. I love you all. Goodbye.'\\" Allen died with an eagle feather on his chest. He was wearing a medicine bag around his neck, and a beaded headband. He was visited shortly before the execution by two Native American spiritual advisers. Allen died at 12:38 a.m. Approximately 250 death penalty opponents gathered for a candlelight vigil outside the walls of San Quentin. His last meal consisted of Buffalo steak and frybread (both are traditional Native American dishes) as well as a bucket of KFC white-meat-only chicken, sugar-free pecan pie, sugar-free walnut ice cream, and whole milk. Correctional officers familiar with Clarence Ray Allen stated that while he was on death row, he often walked without assistance and alleged that he was not blind, as he was able to read his mail. Other information While in the Fresno County Jail on June 27, 1981, Allen called a ‚Äúdeath penalty‚Äù vote for an inmate and directed an attack in which inmates scalded the target inmate with two gallons of hot water, tied him to the cell bars and beat him, shot him with a zip gun, a type of improvised firearm, and threw razor blades and excrement at him.California Department of Justice: \\"The People v.

Telouet Kasbah (Berber: ‚µâ‚µñ‚µî‚µé ‚µè ‚µú‚µç‚µ°‚¥∞‚µú; ; ) is a Kasbah along the former route of the caravans from the Sahara over the Atlas Mountains to Marrakech. The kasbah was the seat of the El Glaoui family's power, thus sometimes also called the Palace of Glaoui, and it was built in the 18th and 19th centuries. The palace can still be visited but it is steadily becoming more damaged and is slowly collapsing. In 2010, work was underway to restore the property. Location The palace is located on the outskirts of the small Berber village of T√©louet, in Morocco. It lies at an elevation of . Occupying a strategic position in the High Atlas, the occupants of the palace had the privilege of being on the passage of caravans and near major salt mines. The kasbah and the village are now accessible by the P1506 road which, coming from the north, is accessed by a junction near the Tizi n'Tichka, from the RN9 road that connects Marrakech to Ouarzazate. History View of the main building. The interior of the T√©louet Kasbah. The passage of the merchant caravans, which connected the desert with the large cities situated on the other side of the Atlas, and the proximity of the salt mines, made the wealth of the Pashas inhabiting Telouet. The current kasbah was built from 1860s by El Glaoui family, next to an ancient kasbah whose remains are still visible today. It was subsequently considerably enlarged during the first half of the twentieth century. Legend has it that 300 workers worked for three years to decorate the ceilings and walls. These are made of stucco, zelliges for the walls, and cedar painting for the ceiling. The roofs are covered with ceramic tiles painted green. The support given to French by El Glaoui, often called the Glaoui during the French occupation in Morocco, earned him the reciprocal support of the French colonial authorities. At the height of his power, the Glaoui family had considerable wealth, making him one of the country's leading figures. But this commitment turned against him during the increasing rise towards the independence of Morocco. He died in oblivion in Marrakech in 1953. The funeral procession was presided over by Crown Prince Moulay Hassan ben Mohammed, the future ruler of Morocco as Hassan II. Since then, mainly because of such political connotation, the kasbah has been almost abandoned. Tourism The kasbah is still visited today, via local guides. Entry is monitored by a guard, who receives low entry fees.

(1590-1670), was a renowned Kurdish and Jewish woman who lived in Iraq. Her writings demonstrate her mastery of Hebrew, Torah, Talmud, Midrash, and Kabbalah. She is considered the first female rabbi of Jewish history by some scholars, as well as one of the first recorded Kurdish women.Kurdish Asenath Barzani, the first Jewish woman in history to become a Rabbi, ekurd.net; accessed 25 December 2016. In her lifetime, Asenath Barzani was referred to by the title tanna‚Äôit rather than ‚Äúrabbi‚Äù, however, though the denomination tanna‚Äôit is a rabbinical title, it is not identical to the title of rabbi. Nevertheless, since her father who was also a rabbi and was himself labeled Tannai (the male noun of Tanna‚Äôit) and not by the title rabbi, it is clear that in the Kurdistan of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the rabbi usually performed as Tannai, so it was determined likely that Asenath Barzani was therefore the first woman rabbi, while Hannah Rochel Verbermacher (1815‚Äì1888) was the first woman consulted as a Rebbe, and Regina Jonas (1902-1942) was the first woman who was called a Rabbi. Life and work Barzani was the daughter of Rabbi Samuel ben Nethanel HaLevi Barzani, a rabbinic scholar, whose authority was absolute though he held no official position. He had founded several yeshivot and was head of the yeshivah in Mosul. He lived in great poverty and was regarded as a saint. He had no sons, and he was his daughter's primary teacher. A master of Kabbalah, he was said to have taught his daughter the secrets of Kabbalah. Barzani adored her father, and regarded him as a King of Israel. In a letter, she described her upbringing: Barzani was married to one of her father's best students and nephew,Asnat Barzani (Asenath Barzani). Society for the Study of Women Philosophers. her cousin Rabbi Jacob Mizrahi, who promised her father that she would do no domestic work and could spend her time as a Torah scholar. After her father's death, her husband became head of the yeshivah in Mosul. He was so involved in his studies that she essentially taught the yeshivah students and provided them with rabbinic training. Following her husband's death, the leadership of the yeshivah passed to her naturally, and eventually she became known as the chief teacher of Torah. As neither her father nor her husband had been successful fundraisers, the yeshivah was always in financial difficulties, and Barzani wrote a number of letters requesting funds in which she described her and her children's difficult situation. Her home and belongings had been confiscated, including her books, but she felt that as a woman it was inappropriate for her to travel in search of financial support. Barzani wrote: In spite of the financial problems, she successfully ran the yeshivah which continued to produce serious scholars, including her son, whom she sent to Baghdad, where he continued the dynasty of rabbinic scholars. Her few extant writings demonstrate a complete mastery of Hebrew, Torah, Talmud, Midrash, as well as Kabbalah, and her letters are not only erudite, but also lyrical. After her death, many Jews made pilgrimages to her grave in Amadiyah in Northern Iraq, where her father is also buried. Barzani was also known as a poet. She is said to have authored a piyut (liturgical poem) in Kurdish, called Ga‚Äôagua L‚ÄôZion (Longing for Zion). Title Barzani was given the title Tanna‚Äôit (or tanna'ith), the female form of for a Talmudic scholar, and a rare honour for a Jewish woman. The title of Tanna'it, and her role as head of a yeshiva a rabbinical school, is not equivalent to being a rabbi, and hence she is regarded as a rare example of a female Rabbinical Teacher (but not an actual rabbi which equals a judge) in pre-20th century traditional Judaism. Legends There are many Kurdish stories and legends about her and miracles she performed, including the one described in ‚ÄúA Flock of Angels‚Äù. In local folklore her gender plays a central role, while in life it did not seem to have presented a problem. Many of the stories which allude to her supernatural powers were found in amulets. These include her ability to limit her childbearing to two children so that she could devote herself to her studies, and the ability to ward off an intruder in order to prevent him from raping her by loudly calling out holy names. =A Flock of Angels= According to the legend, her father often appeared in Barzani's dreams, revealing dangers to her and telling her how to avert them. On one such occasion, she went to Am√™d√Æ where she convinced the Jews to celebrate Rosh Hodesh, the new moon, outdoors, as had been their custom before they were threatened by hostile gentiles. As they proceeded with the celebration, there were shouts and they saw flames shoot up into the sky. The synagogue had been set on fire, with all the sacred books and scrolls in it. After Barzani whispered a secret name she had learned from her father, the people saw a flock of angels descending to the roof of the synagogue. The angels beat the flames with their wings, until every last spark had been put out. Then they rose up into the heavens like a flock of white doves and were gone. And when the smoke cleared, everybody saw that not only none of the Jews had been hurt since the congregation had been outdoors, but that another miracle had taken place: the synagogue had not burned, nor were any of the Torah scrolls touched by the flames. After that miracle, the Jews of Am√™d√Æ were not harassed by the gentiles for a long time. Gratefully, they renamed the synagogue after her, and the legend ends with the words \\"and it is still standing today\\".

This long story centers on an unnamed London telegraphist. She deciphers clues to her clients' personal lives from the often cryptic telegrams they submit to her as she sits in the \\"cage\\" at the post office. Sensitive and intelligent, the telegraphist eventually finds out more than she may want to know.  Plot summary  An unnamed telegraphist works in the branch post office at Cocker's, a grocer in a fashionable London neighborhood. Her fianc√©, a decent if unpolished man named Mr. Mudge, wants her to move to a less expensive neighborhood to save money and to be near him at all times. She refuses because she likes the glimpses of society life she gets from the telegrams at her current location. Through those telegrams, she gets \\"involved\\" with a pair of lovers named Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen. By remembering certain code numbers in the telegrams, she manages to reassure Everard at a particular crisis that their secrets are safe from detection. Later she learns from her friend Mrs. Jordan that Lady Bradeen and Everard are getting married after the recent death of Lord Bradeen. The unnamed telegraphist also learns that Everard is heavily in debt and that Lady Bradeen is forcing him to marry her, as Everard is really not interested in her. The telegraphist finally decides to marry Mudge and reflects on the unusual events of which she was a part.  Key themes  James frequently sent telegrams (over a hundred are still extant) and he got the idea for this clever tale from his experiences at the telegraphist's office. The unnamed protagonist of In the Cage can be seen as a version of the Jamesian artist, constructing a complex finished work from the slightest hints. Her knack of deducing the details of her customers' lives from their brief, cryptic telegrams is similar, in some ways, to James' ability to invent stories from the tiniest suggestions - an ability he often discussed in the New York Edition prefaces.  Critical evaluation  Critics have generally been very kind to this relatively little-known story. The detailed and convincing portrait of the telegraphist has garnered much praise. More politically-inclined critics have appreciated James's ability to present a working-class woman with sympathy and accuracy. Some have compared the story to The Turn of the Screw, published just before In the Cage. The unnamed protagonists of both stories do display active imaginations, but the telegraphist seems much better grounded in reality. At least critics do not ask whether she has imagined Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen. A few critics have amused themselves by trying to guess exactly what the telegraphist deciphered from the telegrams between Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen. James himself said that he didn't know and he didn't want to know. The young lady has read perhaps a few too many ha'penny novels, has a lively imagination and a nearly photographic memory. Her decision to marry her ordinary young man‚Äîas soon as possible‚Äîis a revolt against her discovery that the necessary \\"hero\\" and \\"heroine\\" she has created from their telegrams-aren't that at all. Although James sees the telegraphist as a member of her class, surely, the story is not one of class conflict. It is not that she believes all young, wealthy men and women are good, only that, well, her wealthy young man and women must surely be. Unfortunately, they prove to be more real than wonderful.

The cost of the new screens came to be $1.5 million. The screens are used during the games to show the live feed, highlights, and company promotions. On April 16, 2013, the university announced plans for a $45 million renovation to the arena. The project transformed the 53-year-old facility into a modern arena, with widened concourses, additional bathrooms and upgraded concessions. The proposed facade remade the outdated exterior of the venue into something resembling the brick and art deco architecture of the neighboring Amon G. Carter Stadium. The court was lowered several feet to accommodate additional rows of seating that would fill in the large curves currently on either side of the court, giving fans courtside seating and much closer views of the action. Among the many additions and upgrades were a courtside club on the floor level for season ticket holders and new offices for TCU athletic staff coaches of sports such as soccer, tennis and golf. New locker rooms for both TCU and visiting teams and team meeting rooms were added. TCU was forced to play at another area arena during the 2014-15 season. The project was formally approved by the university on November 7, 2013, with construction beginning in March 2014. There are fences around the arena with outdoor print of the future design of the Daniel‚ÄìMeyer Coliseum. The new arena's renovation was scheduled for completion in October 2015. During the renovations, the university agreed to play games at Wilkerson-Greines Activity Center, a 4,759-seat arena adjacent to Tarrant County College and owned by the Fort Worth Independent School District and located approximately 15 minutes southeast of campus. On July 30, 2015, TCU revised the total cost of the renovations to over $80 million, and announced the facility would be renamed as Ed & Rae Schollmaier Arena for the project's lead donors. The renovated facility was re-opened on December 20, 2015 when the men's basketball team played Abilene Christian.

Pillsbury remembered Lin being the president of the student body in 1971 while was studying Chinese at the same university. During his military training in 1971, Lin applied to enlist rather than return to the university. He transferred to the Republic of China Military Academy, graduating from its 44th class in 1975. =Early education and defection= Frankfurt Book Fair 2009 In 1976 Lin entered the MBA program at National Chengchi University in Taiwan on a defense scholarship and returned to the army upon receiving his MBA in 1978. As a captain in the Republic of China Army in Taiwan, he defected to Mainland China on May 17, 1979, from the island of Kinmen off the coast of Fujian to the nearby island of Xiamen of Mainland China. Lin left his pregnant wife and his three-year-old child in Taiwan; a year after he defected, he was declared \\"missing\\" by the ROC Army and his wife claimed the equivalent of US$31,000 from the government.Jennifer Chou: World Bank's Chief Economist Swam to China?, The Weekly Standard, February 11, 2008 His wife and their children joined him years later when both of them went to study in the United States. While an officer in the ROC Army, Lin was held up as a model soldier; after his desertion, the ROC originally listed him as missing but in 2000 issued an order for his arrest on charges of defection. In a letter written to his family in Taiwan about a year after his defection, Lin stated that \\"based on my cultural, historical, political, economic and military understanding, it is my belief that returning to the motherland is a historical inevitability; it is also the optimal choice.\\" A National Taiwan University alumnus Hongsheng Zheng (ÈÑ≠È¥ªÁîü) confirmed Lin's reason and motive. Lin's oldest brother said it was unfair to brand his younger brother a traitor. \\"I don't understand why people regard him as a villain,\\" he said. \\"My brother just wanted to pursue his ambitions.\\" =Later education and career= Lin received a Master's degree in political economy from Peking University in 1982, and a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago in 1986. He was one of the first PRC citizens to receive a PhD in economics from The University of Chicago,Âá§Âá∞ÁΩëË¥¢Áªè‰∫∫Áâ© (Phoenix Television: The People of Financial Circles), \\"ÊûóÊØÖÂ§´ËØ¶ÁªÜËµÑÊñô (resume of Lin, Yifu)\\", Phoenix Television, 2010. and is a leading Chinese economist; he serves as a consultant to major international organizations and is on the editorial board of several international academic economics journals. On September 16, 2008, Fordham University honored Justin Yifu Lin a reception for his being chief economist and senior vice president of the World Bank. He received an Honorary Doctorate from Fordham in 2009 and was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 2010. His 2012 book, The Quest for Prosperity: How Developing Economies Can Take Off, argued for an active role for government in nurturing development, not just through the traditional provision of infrastructure and legal enforcement, but also by identifying and actively supporting industries that contribute to growth. Lin is the founder and first director of the China Center for Economic Research and a former professor of economics at Peking University and at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

The arena, officially known as the Colorado State Auditorium-Gymnasium, was opened on January 24, 1966, with a victory over New Mexico State. The arena was built to replace South College Gymnasium, which was built in 1926 and seated 1,500 people. Design and name On the outside, the arena is a rounded rectangle over the indented lower level, with a hump- shaped roof arcing over the long sides of the building. Inside, the seating is much higher on the sidelines than in the endzones. However, the most recognizable features of the arena are the corner walls which divide the sidelines from the end zones, and feature large ram's horn patterns on each one, radiating out from the near corners. The basketball court floor also features the ram's horns pattern, created with the use of two different colors of hardwood (the horns use the darker shade). A video scoreboard hangs from the center of the rafters, and is surrounded by banners as well as retractable basketball hoops for use during practice. Two auxiliary scoreboards are located on opposite corner walls (to the right when standing on either sideline). The arena was originally intended to be called the Auditorium- Gymnasium during construction, and the building is still listed as such on state records. However, an article in the Colorado State Collegian mentioned the hump-shaped building looking like a beached whale. From that, the gymnasium was nicknamed \\"Moby Gymnasium\\" for Moby Dick, the white whale of Herman Mellville's classic story. Athletic director Oval Jaynes renamed the gymnasium \\"Moby Arena\\" during his tenure in the late 1980s. Uses The arena is home to the Colorado State University Rams basketball and volleyball teams. In 1967, it hosted two first-round games for the West and Midwest regions, for that year's Men's Basketball Tournament. It also hosted the 1992 Western Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament. Moby Arena also hosts concerts. The Rolling Stones played the first show of their 1969 tour at the arena. Other artists to have played there are Frank Zappa, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Steve Miller Band, O.A.R., Dave Matthews Band, The Fray, Blind Melon, Set Forth, Gov't Mule and Ludacris. Lupe Fiasco, Three 6 Mafia, Guess Who, Beach Boys, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Doobie Brothers, Chicago, Jerry Jeff Walker, Van Halen, and Willie Nelson and Tanya Tucker.

It is considered a great example of Moroccan earthen clay architecture and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.  History  Mosque in the modern village across the valley from the old ksar, where most residents now live The site of the ksar has been fortified since the 11th century during the Almoravid period. None of the current buildings are believed to date from before the 17th century, but they were likely built with the same construction methods and designs as had been used for centuries before. The site's strategic importance was due to its location in the Ounila Valley along one of the main trans-Saharan trade routes. The Tizi n'Tichka pass, which was reached via this route, was one of the few routes across the Atlas Mountains, crossing between Marrakech and the Dra'a Valley on the edge of the Sahara. Other kasbahs and ksour were located all along this route, such as the nearby Tamdaght to the north. Today, the ksar itself is only sparsely inhabited by several families. The depopulation over time is a result of the valley's loss of strategic importance in the 20th century. Most local inhabitants now live in modern dwellings in the village on the other side of the river, and make a living off agriculture and especially off the tourist trade.  Description  View of the ksar from above alt= = Layout of the site = The ksar is located on the slopes of a hill next to the Ounila River (Asif Ounila). The village's buildings are grouped together within a defensive wall that includes corner towers and a gate. They include dwellings of various size ranging from modest houses to tall structures with towers. Some of the buildings are decorated in their upper parts with geometric motifs. The village also has a number of public or community buildings such as a mosque, a caravanserai, a kasbah (castle-like fortification) and the Marabout of Sidi Ali or Amer. At the top of the hill, overlooking the ksar, are the remains of a large fortified granary (agadir). There is also a public square, a Muslim cemetery, and a Jewish cemetery. Outside the ksar's walls was an area where grain was grown and threshed. = Building materials = The ksar's structures are made entirely out of rammed earth, clay bricks, and wood. Rammed earth (also known as pis√©, tabia, or al-luh) was a highly practical and cost-effective material but required consistent maintenance. It was made of compressed earth and mud, usually mixed with other materials to aid adhesion. The structures of Ait Benhaddou and of other kasbahs and ksour throughout this region of Morocco typically employed a mixture of earth and straw, which was relatively permeable and easily eroded by rain over time. As a result, villages of this type can begin to crumble only a few decades after being abandoned.  Preservation  The ksar has been significantly restored in modern times, thanks in part to its use as a Hollywood filming location and to its inscription on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1987. UNESCO reports that the ksar has \\"preserved its architectural authenticity with regard to configuration and materials\\" by continuing to use traditional construction materials and techniques and by largely avoiding new concrete constructions. A local committee is in charge of monitoring and managing the site.

After almost 15 years of the Rhodesian Bush War, and under pressure from the sanctions placed on Rhodesia by the international community, and political pressure from South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the Rhodesian government met with some of the internally based moderate African nationalist leaders in order to reach an agreement on the political future for the country. The agreement led to the creation of an interim government in which Africans were included in leading positions for the first time. This in turn was to lead to the achievement of the settlement's main goal which was for the country to gain international recognition, which in turn implied that sanctions imposed on Rhodesia which came about as a result of the announcement of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence of 1965, would be abolished. Following the agreement, the general election of March 1979 was held which brought Muzorewa and his UANC party to power. The electorate was not qualified by race, but purely on meeting certain conditions, such as educational standard and/or income and/or worth of property owned enabling a majority of Africans to vote for the first time. The election process was witnessed by international observers, who were in agreement that the process had, in the main, been free and fair. Zimbabwe Rhodesia A new government of national unity with Bishop Abel Muzorewa as Prime Minister took office on 1 June 1979. The country was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia, and a new national flag was later adopted signifying the transition. It was expected that all sanctions would be lifted now that the country was under democratically elected black majority rule. However, the lifting of sanctions did not occur mainly because the Patriotic Front, composed of the externally based African nationalist parties of ZAPU and ZANU under the respective leadership of Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe, had not been involved in the political process and had not participated in the general election. Under mounting international pressure, particularly from Jimmy Carter, Andrew Young and the British Government, Muzorewa was persuaded to take part in negotiations at Lancaster House late 1979. The agreement at the Lancaster House Conference between the Zimbabwe Rhodesia and British Governments, ZAPU and ZANU in December 1979 resulted in a ceasefire and the end of the Rhodesian Bush War. The country returned to legality under direct British rule with Lord Christopher Soames as Governor, thereby ending the rebellion against the British Crown caused by the signing of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in November 1965. Under the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement, fresh general election was held in February 1980 following which the country attained its independence as the Republic of Zimbabwe on 18 April 1980 with Robert Mugabe as its first Prime Minister. Reaction After the internal settlement was announced, the United Kingdom and the United States‚Äîin separate statements‚Äîsaid that they viewed the settlement as a step in the right direction, but nevertheless inadequate because ZANU and ZAPU were not included. Each of the Frontline States‚ÄîAngola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia‚Äîcondemned the settlement as a \\"sell-out\\" and accused Muzorewa, Sithole, and Chirau of being complicit with the illegal regime. The Patriotic Front, composed of ZANU and ZAPU, also condemned the settlement and similarly accused the three black signatories of being Rhodesian puppets. It vowed to continue fighting until attaining a military victory in the war. The Council of Ministers of the Organisation of African Unity had several days earlier‚Äîat its thirtieth ordinary session in Tripoli, Libya, from 20‚Äì28 February 1978‚Äîforeseen the prospect of a settlement, and issued a statement condemning any agreement that did not include the Patriotic Front. Prompted by the request of the African Group within the United Nations, the UN Security Council of discussed the issue of Rhodesia's internal settlement at its 2061st to 2067th meetings from 6‚Äì14 March 1978. Robert Mugabe and Joshuo Nkomo spoke before the Council and condemned the settlement. On 14 March 1978, the Security Council adopted Resolution 423, which condemned the internal settlement as illegal and unacceptable. Canada, France, the US, the UK, and West Germany abstained from the vote.s:United Nations Security Council Resolution 423 Further reading *Catholic Institute for International Relations, Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Rhodesia.

He was an acoustic single-note picker in the Chicago blues and Piedmont blues styles. Some critics have noted that he veered towards jazz. Biography Blackwell was born in Syracuse, South Carolina, one of sixteen children of Payton and Elizabeth Blackwell. He was part Cherokee. He grew up and spent most of his life in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was given the nickname \\"Scrapper\\" by his grandmother, because of his fiery nature. His father played the fiddle, but Blackwell was a self-taught guitarist, building his first guitar out of a cigar box, wood and wire. He also learned to play the piano, occasionally performing professionally. By his teens, Blackwell was a part-time musician, traveling as far as Chicago. He was known for being withdrawn and hard to work with, but he established a rapport with the pianist Leroy Carr, whom he met in Indianapolis in the mid-1920s, and they had a productive working relationship. Carr convinced Blackwell to record with him for Vocalion Records in 1928; the result was \\"How Long, How Long Blues\\", the biggest blues hit of that year. Blackwell also made solo recordings for Vocalion, including \\"Kokomo Blues\\", which was transformed into \\"Old Kokomo Blues\\" by Kokomo Arnold and later reworked as \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" by Robert Johnson. Blackwell and Carr toured throughout the American Midwest and South between 1928 and 1935 as stars of the blues circuit, recording over 100 sides. \\"Prison Bound Blues\\" (1928), \\"Mean Mistreater Mama\\" (1934), and \\"Blues Before Sunrise\\" (1934) were popular tracks. Blackwell made several solo excursions. A 1931 visit to Richmond, Indiana, to record at Gennett studios is noteworthy. Blackwell was dissatisfied with the lack of credit given his contributions with Carr; the situation was remedied by Vocalion's Mayo Williams after his 1931 breakaway: in all future recordings, Blackwell and Carr received equal songwriting credits and equal status in recording contracts. Blackwell's last recording session with Carr was in February 1935, for Bluebird Records. The session ended bitterly, as both musicians left the studio mid-session and on bad terms, stemming from payment disputes. Two months later Blackwell received a phone call informing him of Carr's death due to heavy drinking and nephritis. Blackwell soon recorded a tribute to his musical partner of seven years (\\"My Old Pal Blues\\"). After the death of Carr, Blackwell did a few recordings with piano player Dot Rice, without much success; the song \\"No Good Woman Blues\\" shows Blackwell as the singer. A short time later Blackwell retired from the music industry. Blackwell returned to music in the late 1950s. He was recorded by Colin C. Pomroy in June 1958 (those recordings were released in 1967 on the Collector label). Soon afterwards he was recorded by Duncan P. Schiedt for Doug Dobell's 77 Records. Blackwell was then recorded in 1961, in Indianapolis, by the young Art Rosenbaum for the Prestige/Bluesville Records label. The story was recounted by Rosenbaum as starting three years before the recordings were made. When he was growing up in Indianapolis, Rosenbaum knew an African-American woman who said that he \\"had to meet a man that she knew, who played guitar, played blues and christian songs, they'll make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.\\" Rosenbaum subsequently met Blackwell: \\"I met the gentleman across the street from the Methodist hospital in Indianapolis\\". Blackwell's friend said, \\"well he hasn't got a guitar\\", so Rosenbaum said, \\"well I got a guitar.\\" Blackwell than said that he needed some \\"bird food\\". Rosenbaum did not understand what he was referring to, so Blackwell explained, \\"you gotta get some bird food for the bird, before the bird sings... beer!\\" Rosenbaum said, \\"I'm too young!\\" Blackwell continued, \\"we'll buy the beer, you just give us some money.\\" Rosenbaum recalled, \\"So we did, and he started playing these beautiful blues. I didn't realize he was Scrapper Blackwell til I mentioned his name to a blues collecting friend\\", when the friend exclaimed, \\"you met Scrapper Blackwell!?\\" Blackwell was ready to resume his blues career when he was shot and killed in a mugging in an Indianapolis alley. He was 59 years old. The police arrested his neighbor at the time for the murder, but the crime remains unsolved. Blackwell is buried in New Crown Cemetery, in Indianapolis.

The western segment runs from State Routes 41 and 180 in Fresno east to Huntington Lake along the western slope of the Sierra. The eastern segment connects Lake Sabrina in the Eastern Sierra to State Route 266 in the community of Oasis, just to the west of the Nevada border. The eastern segment of SR 168 also forms a concurrency with U.S. Route 395 between Bishop and Big Pine. Route description Bishop Creek, Eastern Sierra The western segment of SR 168 begins as the Sierra Freeway in southeast Fresno at its interchange with Highway 180. After reaching Shephard Avenue at the northeast edge of Clovis, it becomes the two-lane Tollhouse Road before it starts to being its ascent up the Sierra Foothills. Near Humphreys Station, Tollhouse Road branches off and takes a direct route northeast to Tollhouse, while SR 168 bypasses northwest through Prather. SR 168 and Tollhouse Road then merge again north of Tollhouse. In Ockenden, SR 168 changes from Tollhouse Road to Huntington Lake Road. The highway then continues east up the Sierra Nevada, passing Shaver Lake before ending at Huntington Lake. Before the reconstruction of urban Route 168 as a freeway, the route started at SR 41 and Shaw Avenue in Fresno. SR 168 ran along Shaw Avenue, Clovis Avenue, Third Street (Clovis), and Tollhouse Road to the current end of the freeway. SR 168 cannot be used to cross the Sierra Nevada. The closest crossings of the Sierra Nevada are SR 120 via Tioga Pass to the north and Sherman Pass to the south. Both of these passes are accessible in warmer months only. The eastern segment of SR 168 has its western terminus at Lake Sabrina on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada. This rural mountain road runs east to the town of Bishop, then joins U.S. Route 395 for 14.6 miles, and separates from 395 in Big Pine. SR 168 then climbs into the White Mountains through Westgard Pass, passing the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest. From here it traverses Deep Springs Valley, home of Deep Springs College, before crossing into Fish Lake Valley, where the segment ends at SR 266, just west of the Nevada Border. The segment of the highway from Lake Sabrina east to the community of Aspendell is subject to closure to most vehicles during the winter months, usually not opening until mid- or late-April, due to snow removal. The winter road closure gate is actually located to the southwest of Aspendell. SR 168 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and in the Fresno and Clovis city limits is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 168 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, and is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation from Camp Sabrina to Brockman Lane on the Lone Pine Indian Reservation. Two portions of SR 168 are designated as National Forest Scenic Byways: the segment between Clovis and Huntington Lake is the Sierra Heritage Scenic Byway, while the segment from Camp Sabrina to Brockman Lane is the Ancient Bristlecone Scenic Byway. History The eastern part of the route, from the eastern over Westgard Pass to the Nevada state line near Lida, Nevada predates the era of numbered highways and dates to the auto trail era as part of the Midland Trail, one of the earliest transcontinental roads in the USA. It was at Big Pine that the Midland trail forked in its westward journey to its eventual western termini, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The western descent from Westgard Pass into the Owens Valley was described as a \\"Welcome to California\\" view in the route guides for the Midland trail. Though SR 168 is the original routing of the Midland Trail, the route was realigned numerous times, and signs today mark U.S. Route 6 as the routing of the Midland Trail from California east to Denver, Colorado. When the state of California began conceiving its own route network, modern SR 168 was conceived as a trans- Sierra highway connecting Fresno and Bishop. The proposed route, named the High Sierra Piute Highway, would have taken the highway over the Piute Pass. However, the two segments were never connected. The rugged Sierra crest and eastern escarpment would have made construction very difficult and today two congressionally designated wilderness areas block the way: Kings Canyon National Park and the John Muir Wilderness. The traversable route now comprises Kaiser Pass Road from Huntington Lake to Florence Lake, various hiking trails from Florence Lake and through the Piute Pass to North Lake, and North Lake Road to a point along SR 168 east of where the highway connects to Lake Sabrina. As originally designated SR 168 extended to the Nevada state line. The easternmost section of SR 168 was transferred to California State Route 266 in 1986.

Albatross was built by Cockatoo Island Dockyard during the mid-1920s and entered service at the start of 1929. The ship experienced problems with the aircraft assigned to her during her career: the amphibious aircraft she had been designed for were retired just before the ship entered service, the replacement aircraft could not be catapult-launched from the ship, and a new plane designed specifically to work with the ship began operations after Albatross was demoted from seagoing status in 1933. After five years in reserve, Albatross was transferred to the Royal Navy to offset the Australian purchase of the light cruiser . Although the British had little use for a seaplane carrier, the ship found a niche after two aircraft carriers were sunk by the Germans early in World War II. Albatross was initially based in Freetown, Sierra Leone for patrol and convoy escort duties in the southern Atlantic, then was relocated to the Indian Ocean in mid-1942. From late 1943 to early 1944, the vessel underwent conversion into a \\"Landing Ship (Engineering)\\" to support the Normandy landings, and was used to repair landing craft and other support vessels off Sword and Juno Beaches. Albatross was torpedoed in October, but survived to be towed back to England and repaired. After repairs completed at the start of 1945, she served as a minesweeper depot ship, but was decommissioned after the war's end. Albatross was sold into civilian service in August 1946, and after several changes of hands was renamed Hellenic Prince in 1948 and converted into a passenger liner. The vessel was chartered by the International Refugee Organisation to transport refugees from Europe to Australia. Hellenic Prince saw service as a troopship during the 1953 Mau Mau uprising, but was broken up for scrap a year later. Design and construction In 1925, Governor-General Lord Stonehaven announced the construction of a seaplane carrier, to the surprise of both the RAN and RAAF.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 16 The decision to acquire a seaplane carrier was prompted by both the need to provide work during the high unemployment of the 1920s and the realisation that a conventional aircraft carrier was outside the ability of the RAN to finance or man. The Australian Commonwealth Naval Board requested that the British Admiralty supply a basic design for a seaplane carrier, with the conditions that the ship have a top speed of , and cost under 400,000 pounds if built in a British shipyard. The ship displaced 4,800 tons at standard load.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 11 She was long overall, with a beam of at her moulded depth and over the gun sponsons, and an initial maximum draught of , although this had increased to by 1936. The propulsion machinery consisted of four Yarrow boilers supplying Parsons geared turbines. These generated , which was fed to two propeller shafts. Although Albatross was designed with a maximum speed of , full-power trials showed that the ship was capable of . At that speed, she had a range of , although she could cover at the more economical . Albatross armament consisted of four QF 4.7-inch Mk VIII naval guns, four QF 2-pounder pom-pom guns, four QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting guns, four .303-inch Vickers machine guns, and twenty .303-inch Lewis machine guns (ten singles and five twin mounts). The ship's company consisted of 29 RAN officers, 375 RAN sailors, 8 RAAF officers, and 38 RAAF enlisted.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 12 The launch of Albatross in 1926 Development of the ship from the Admiralty sketch design was based around the Fairey IIID seaplane being operated for the RAN by the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 101 Flight.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 17 Albatross could carry up to nine aircraft‚Äîsix active and three in reserve‚Äîin three internal hangars; their incorporation inside the ship's hull resulted in an unusually high freeboard in the forward half of the vessel, and forced the propulsion machinery, accommodation, and bridge to all be located in the aft half. Three recovery cranes were used to manipulate the aircraft. The Faireys were removed from service shortly before Albatross entered service, and were replaced by the Supermarine Seagull Mark III. The Mark IIIs were unsuited for operations aboard Albatross, particularly as the aircraft were not durable enough to withstand catapult launches. Specifications for a new aircraft design were drawn up to the RAN and RAAF, and Supermarine designed the Seagull Mark V (later to be called the Walrus) specifically for Albatross, although the design was later adopted by the Royal Navy.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 18‚Äì20 Albatross was removed from seagoing service in 1933, two months before the Mark Vs entered service, although the aircraft were operated from the vessel while she was at anchor.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 18‚Äì19 In addition, the new Seagulls were too tall to manoeuvre around inside the hangars, although this problem was worked around by placing the aircraft, with undercarriage retracted, on specially designed trolleys.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 19 Albatross was laid down by the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney on 16 April 1926. She was launched by the wife of the Governor-General of Australia, Baron Stonehaven of Ury on 23 February 1928. Albatross was completed on 21 December 1928, and commissioned into the RAN on 23 January 1929. She cost 1,200,000 pounds to construct. Operational history =Royal Australian Navy= HMAS Albatross began her first cruise a week after commissioning, visiting Tasmania and Victoria. On 11 April 1929, the ship was sent from Sydney to off Wyndham, Western Australia to search for Sir Charles Kingsford Smith and the Southern Cross, which had disappeared while en route to England. Before the ship could reach the area, Smith was found, having made an emergency landing near the Glenelg River.Molkentin, Flying the Southern Cross, p. 172 A Seagull III amphibian being manoeuvred towards the hangar hatch following recovery In November 1931, the ship's engines were damaged by sabotage.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 125 This occurred again in September 1932. The acts of sabotage were attributed to widespread unrest among the sailors at the time; the RAN claimed at the time that Communist influence was the cause, although Tom Frame and Kevin Baker ascribe it to Depression-era pay cuts and retrentions, which were more likely to be forced onto sailors than officers. Albatross in 1938 On 26 April 1933, Albatross was decommissioned into reserve and anchored in Sydney Harbour, although seaplanes continued to operate from the ship.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 18 In 1938, with the Australian government experiencing difficulties in funding the purchase of the light cruiser , the British Admiralty agreed to accept Albatross as part payment for Hobart (266,500 pounds was credited against the cruiser's purchase price). The seaplane carrier was recommissioned on 19 April for the voyage to England, and departed on 11 July, with the ship's company transferring to Hobart on arrival. =Royal Navy= There was originally little need for a seaplane carrier in the Royal Navy, as several aircraft carriers were operational, and most warships from cruiser size up carried their own seaplanes. However, the loss of the aircraft carriers and early in World War II created scope for the ship's use. Albatross was assigned to Freetown in western Africa, where she and her aircraft were used for convoy escort, anti-submarine warfare, and air- sea rescue in the Atlantic. In May 1942, Albatross was transferred to the Indian Ocean to bolster trade protection there with the Eastern Fleet based at Kilindini, and in September provided air support for landings at Mayotte, during the Madagascan campaign. After this, trade protection duties were resumed and continued until July 1943 (apart from refits at Durban and Bombay). Albatross then returned to Britain, where, in September, she was paid off. From October 1943 until early 1944, Albatross underwent major conversion, to a Landing Ship ‚Äì Engineering (LSE), to support the Normandy landings. She was initially deployed in the Thames estuary as part of the deceptions to divert enemy attention away from Normandy, but on 8 June 1944, she was moved to Gooseberry 5, off Sword Beach at Ouistreham to provide repair facilities and supply anti-aircraft and bombardment support. Her allocation immediately followed the assault and coincided with the \\"great storm\\" that disrupted Allied plans. Her repair duties at Sword saved 79 craft from total loss and returned 132 more to service off the beachhead. In July, Albatross returned to Portsmouth for replenishment and to rest her crew and, on return to Normandy, she was reallocated to Juno Beach. On 11 August, while off Courseulles-sur- Mer, Albatross was hit by a torpedo which inflicted major structural damage and killed 66 of the ship's company. Albatross was withdrawn from service and towed to Portsmouth by the Dutch tug Zwart Zee. Her repairs lasted until early 1945. After a brief spell as a minesweeper depot ship, she was paid off into reserve on 3 August 1945.Mason, HMS Albatross =Post-war= Hellenic Prince photographed between 1949 and 1951 Albatross was sold to a British company on 19 August 1946 for commercial use. The plan was to originally convert her into a luxury liner, but as the refurbishment was financially prohibitive, it was instead proposed that she be renamed Pride of Torquay and used as a floating cabaret at Torquay.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 12‚Äì13 Before this went through, the ship was purchased on 14 November 1948 by the British-Greek Yannoulatos Group, and was renamed Hellenic Prince to recognise the birth of Prince Charles on that day, and his Greek heritage.Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Albatross (I)Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 13 The vessel was converted into a passenger liner at Barry in Wales. In 1949, she was chartered by the International Refugee Organisation as a refugee transport to relocate displaced persons from Europe to Australia. On 5 December 1949, Hellenic Prince arrived in Sydney Harbour with 1,000 passengers. In 1953, Hellenic Prince was used as a troopship during the Mau Mau uprising. The ship's career finally ended when she was scrapped at Hong Kong on 12 August 1954.

The reef has been a navigational hazard to shipping for centuries with seventy-one named wrecks and an estimated two hundred shipwrecks overall, the most infamous being the oil tanker Torrey Canyon on 18 March 1967. The rocks are only exposed at half tide and it was not feasible to build a lighthouse so a lightvessel was provided by Trinity House. The first was moored near the reef on 20 August 1841 and exhibited its first light on 1 September 1841. She is permanently anchored in and is north-east (NE) of the reef. Since 1987, the Sevenstones Lightship has been automated and unmanned. The Seven Stones lightvessel also acts as an automatic weather station. A series of Trinity House lightships stationed near the Sevenstones Reef have measured significant wave heights (Hs or SWH)‚Äîthe periodic average of the highest one third of waves in a spectrum‚Äîsince the early 1960s using Ship Borne Wave Recorders (SBWR). The Sevenstones Lightship is in a very exposed location and is open to most North Atlantic storms. First lightvessel Sevenstones Lightship, showing moorings As early as 1826 the government was petitioned to build a light on the reef and a second petition in 1839, supported by the Chamber of Commerce of Waterford, merchants from Liverpool and the Bristol Channel ports resulted in a meeting being held in Falmouth on 21 February 1840. It was declared that a light on or near the reef would shorten the passage around Scilly by up to thirty-six hours. As a result, the first lightship was moored, in on a slate and sand bottom, near the reef on 20 August 1841 and shone its first light on 1 September 1841. Originally there was a crew of ten with five on station at a time. A few months after being placed in position she drifted from her anchorage and was consequently provided with a new \\"mushroom\\" anchor which was better suited to lightships. The West Briton of 25 November 1842 reported that her cable parted and she almost became a wreck when she drove over the reef at high tide. The crew steered the ship to New Grimsby, Tresco, from where she was towed back, and on 6 January 1843 she broke adrift again. The following March, she was found drifting in a moderate southwest breeze, and was again towed to New Grimsby. She was towed back to her position on 10 April, and anchored in . Relief occurred monthly with the master or mate and twelve men always on board, with the other officer and three men on shore in rotation. Houses were provided on Tresco for the crew and provisions were procured by crew members rowing and sailing to New Grimsby in the vessel's longboat. Two of the crew drowned on 15 October 1851 when one of the lightship's longboats capsized in a squall, while on a journey from Scilly with stores. Following a dispute with Augustus Smith, the governor of the Isles of Scilly, accommodation and provisions were provided from Penzance. The crew would have had a fright when a meteor exploded over the lightvessel, at 2 am on 13 November 1872, showering the deck with cinders. On 30 January 1873 the London barque Athole came too close and caught her rigging on the lightship's bumpkin carrying away her main and mizzen halyards, and the starboard light. =Design= Built by William Pitcher of Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, Blackwall, the cost of the hull came to ¬£3,128 8s and the fully equipped vessel ¬£4,416 8s 7d. Built of wood, with a tonnage of 162, her length was , breadth and her two masts for the lights were and tall. She carried one lug sail, a staysail and a jib. Red balls were fixed on each mast to distinguish her from other lightvessels. The two lights were displayed at and , were of the catoptric system and could be seen from away. She also carried a gong fog signal. Trevose Head Lighthouse, on the north Cornish coast, also had two lights and the Sevenstones light was reduced to one, to stop confusion between the two. The single light was originally intended to be installed in 1878 but was postponed to May 1879 By 1891 only one white light was displayed at with three quick flashes followed by thirty-six seconds of darkness. In stormy weather or in fog it was difficult for mariners to tell where they were and similar lights added to the confusion. Temporary lightvessel On Saturday 3 May 1879 a temporary lightvessel was towed to the Sevenstones from Milford by the new Trinity House yacht Siren and the old vessel towed to London. Second lightvessel (No 50) The temporary lightvessel was removed on 18 September 1879 and towed to Milford by Vestal. The new light was successfully moored the same day, with the latest in fog- warning machinery and a revolving light, instead of the two fixed lights on the old vessel. Number 50 was removed to London in 1883 for repair and a thorough overhaul and was replaced by lightship number 35. Third lightvessel Lightvessel 80 took up her position during the Second World War and was replaced with a lighted buoy after being frequently bombed and strafed by the Luftwaffe. She broke adrift in March 1948 and her engine failed in November 1950. She was replaced in 1958 by lightvessel 19. Lightvessel 80's last known sighting was in a Sotheby's catalogue for sale at ¬£85,000. =Design= Lightvessel 80 was built by H & C Grayson, of Liverpool in 1914. She was long, had a breadth of and was 318 tons. In 1954 she undertook a refit with the provision of hot water, electric lighting, refrigerator, one and two- berth cabins and a roomy mess deck. Daily work on the ship such as watch- keeping and maintenance of the 600,000 candle power lantern could be carried out without going outside. Before, the refit crew had to climb up the mast every morning to trim the lamps, hauling their supply of oil with them; a dangerous task in rough weather. Fourth lightvessel Sevenstones Light Vessel, LV 19 Lightvessel 19 was in position in 1958 and was on station when Torrey Canyon became, at that time, the largest shipwreck in world history. The lightship was towed to Penzance for a few days while the wreck was bombed by Fleet Air Arm aircraft; in an attempt to release the remaining oil on board and set fire to it. =Design= Lightvessel 19 was built by Philip and Son of Dartmouth and launched on 30 May 1958 and the Sevenstones was her first station. She is long and wide, a gross tonnage of 390 and cost ¬£118,854. She had the same 600,000 candle power as the previous ship and shone a group of three white flashes every thirty seconds, visible in good conditions to . Fifth lightvessel Lightvessel 22 was built by Richards Shipbuilders of Lowestoft in 1967 with a displacement of 390 tons. Her length is and breadth and she was on station from 1998‚Äì2001. She is currently the St Gowan lightvessel. Sixth lightvessel Lightvessel 2 was in position in October 2004. Automated weather station The lightship serves as an automated weather station for the UK Met Office and is owned and maintained by Trinity House. On-board equipment measures wind speed and direction, current atmospheric pressure and its tendency, air temperature, dew point and water temperature. The lightship also carries a Ship-Borne Wave Recorder which measures significant wave height, abbreviated Hs, and the corresponding average wave period, abbreviated Ts. Hs is the average height of the highest third of all waves occurring during the measurement time interval. Ts is the average period, in seconds, of those same waves. All of these data are updated hourly, on the hour. Wave activity recorded at the Sevenstones Lightship The largest waves tend to occur when there is a large westerly or west northwesterly Atlantic fetch. The Sevenstones lightvessel does not report individual wave heights; she reports only the significant wave height Hs. This measurement gives mariners a general indication of the sea state in this notoriously hazardous shipping area. However, it is worth noting that maximum wave heights in any sea state frequently exceed Hs.http://www.channelcoast.org/ The Rayleigh distribution shows statistically that if Hs is, for example, 33 ft, then one wave in 100 will be larger than 50 ft. This relationship is frequently confirmed by eyewitness accounts. In 1989 the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences' Deacon Laboratory published a report on wave measurements at the station from 1962 to 1988. It revealed a high- energy wave environment at the Sevenstones Reef, with an Hs of over recorded on 17 October 1982, and recorded on 16 January 1974. In February 2014, Hs values of were recorded on 1 February at 15.00 GMT, and on 8 February at 10.00 GMT. More recently, on 8 February 2016 at 10.00 GMT, an Hs of was recorded at the station. This activity resulted from the Atlantic storm Imogen.http://magicseaweed.com/Sevenstones-Lightship-Wave- Buoy/61774/?start_format=07+Feb+2016&end;_format=08+Feb+2016&spot;_id= BBC News, citing the UK Met Office, reported that maximum wave heights off the Cornish Coast on this day were recorded at 63 ft (19.1m) at the nearby Wave Hub Buoy stationed at 50¬∞ 20.833'N 005¬∞ 36.853'W.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35516741http://coastalmonitoring.org/data_management/real_time_data/charts/?chart=116&tab;=waves&disp;_option= Based on its closeness, the direction of the waves and the similarity of the Hs values, the Sevenstones Lightship would most likely have encountered similar maximum wave heights. Generally, wave patterns in this area are believed to correlate with the North Atlantic Oscillation Index.

It has about 4‚Äì5 times more effectiveness against class B fires than carbon dioxide, and more than twice that of sodium bicarbonate. Some fire extinguishers are capable of operation in temperatures down to ‚àí54 ¬∞C or up to +49 ¬∞C. Dry chemical works by directly inhibiting the chemical chain reaction which forms one of the four sides of the fire tetrahedron (heat + oxygen + fuel + chemical chain reaction = fire). To a much smaller degree it also has a smothering effect by excluding oxygen from the fire. \\"Dry chemical\\" extinguishers, such as Purple-K, are different from \\"dry powder\\" extinguishers that are used to fight Class D flammable metal fires. Purple-K was developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory in 1959, as an improvement over sodium bicarbonate for extinguishing oil and gasoline fires. It was named due to the characteristic lavender tint imparted to flames, owing to the potassium (chemical symbol \\"K\\") content. \\"Purple K Powder\\", \\"Naval Aviation News\\", September 1959, page 19, Characteristics Purple-K powder has an acrid taste and odor, is free-flowing, floating on most liquids, non-abrasive, does not wet with water and is compatible with most foam concentrates. It has violet color, to distinguish it from other dry agents. Its principal component is potassium bicarbonate (78‚Äì82% by weight), with addition of sodium bicarbonate (12‚Äì15%), mica (1‚Äì3%), Fuller's earth (1‚Äì3%), amorphous silica (0.2‚Äì%), and is made hydrophobic by methyl hydrogen polysiloxane (0.2‚Äì1%). Purple-K is normally non-toxic, but ingestion of large amount can cause alkalosis. Uses Purple-K is commonly used in oil refineries, airport ramps, service stations, military facilities, naval warships, power plants, and other places where large volumes of flammable liquids are handled. It is often paired with foam in twin agent systems, usually found fitted to airport fire appliances. Purple-K is used in many forms, from small handheld fire extinguishers to large mobile and stationary units, including fixed-nozzle piping systems. Cleanup of spent agent can be difficult, as it forms a residue when discharged. If the spent agent is dry it can be removed by suction, but when combined with water, hydrocarbons and other liquids, it forms a thick crusty scum that can be challenging to remove. Purple-K should never be mixed with phosphate-based fire suppression agents (ABC dry chemical), as the resulting chemical reaction will destroy its efficiency.

Zuskin had a title of the People's actor of the Russian SFSR. He was a laureate of the Stalin Prize in 1946.  Biography  Zuskin was born in April 1899 in the town of Ponevezh, then in the Kovno Gubernye, today Panevƒó≈æys, Lithuania, a son of a tailor. He attended a cheder. Zuskin was admitted into a college in 1911. Following the April 1915 defeat of a Russian army at the hands of the German army, the Russian authorities ordered the mass deportation of Jews living in central Lithuania to the interior of the Russian Empire ‚Äî approximately 250,000 were expelled. The Zuskin family went to Penza on the European side of the Urals. There he met and married the daughter of another deported family, Rachel Holand (in Russian, Goland). In Penza, Benjamin continued his studies and took roles in a local theatre. In 1920 he became a student of Sverdlovsk Geological Institute, but in 1921 asked for transfer to Moscow Geological Institute. In that year, a daughter, Tamara, was born in Moscow. Shortly afterward, however, Benjamin and Rachel separated, and Rachel and Tamara moved to Rachel's home town, Ukmergƒó, Lithuania, and soon thereafter to Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. Tamara rejoined her father in Moscow in 1935 and enrolled in medical school there. (Rachel, her second husband, and their three children remained in Kaunas. All but one daughter were killed in the Kovno ghetto, the urban concentration camp established by the Nazis and their Lithuanian collaborators in the Viliampolƒó / Slobodke neighborhood of Kaunas.) Benjamin remarried in 1935 and had another daughter, Alla. His second wife died in 1937.  Theatre career Zuskin joined the Moscow State Jewish Theater in 1921.\\"Zuskin, Benjamin\\" (in Yiddish).

Bloomington: Indiana University Press. p. 45-46. . Zuskin's performance blended with Alexis Granowsky's system of organic interrelation of a word and gesture, plastics and rhythm of movements. His characteristic features were light humor and romanticism which gave additional tints to a controversial life of Jewish hamlet of shtetl. His roles showed to the audience a quarry of talented people among their routine activities. His most famous role was that of the Fool in the 1935 production of King Lear, with Solomon Mikhoels in the title role.Veidlinger (2000), p. 144-145. Zuskin was a partner of Mikhoels until the latter's suspicious death in car accident in Minsk, in January 1948 when Zuskin became the artistic director of the theater.

At the time King was the lead singer and keyboardist for The Necessary. The Necessary was an indie/emo/rock band from Greensboro, with the same members as House of Fools, minus Bowers and Scifres and with David McLaughlin (ex-guitarist/vocalist of House of Fools), Todd Turner (ex-drummer of the band Far-Less) playing drums, and Jeff Linn (ex-bassist of House of Fools) playing bass. Influenced by bands like Jimmy Eat World, The Necessary wrote a wide range of songs released in 2004 on the album This Is Us, for Forsaken Records. The Necessary grew to have a large fanbase in Greensboro. A friend of the band sent demos that Bowers and King had recorded under the name House of Fools to Drive-Thru Records. In November 2004, King was contacted by Drive-Thru Records and was flown out to discuss a record deal. Drive-Thru Records agreed to sign House of Fools to a record deal.

Tyniec is notable for its famous Benedictine abbey founded by King Casimir the Restorer in 1044. The name of the village comes from a Celtic language word \\"tyn\\", which means wall or fence, and which means that the history of Tyniec as a fortified settlement (see gord) dates back to pre-Slavic times. Tyniec lies southwest of the center of Krak√≥w, on the right bank of the Vistula, among limestone Jurassic hills, called the Tyniec Hills, with the highest one being Wielogora (also called Guminek), above sea level. Furthermore, Tyniec has a Vistula canyon (called Tyniec Gate), a Skolczanka Nature Reserve (est. 1957), and a locally renowned water source, Zrodlo Swietojanskie, the only source of this kind in the city of Krak√≥w. In ancient times the village was located along a merchant trade route from Krak√≥w, via Oswiecim, to Moravia and Bohemia.  History of Tyniec  The history of human settlement in the area of the village dates back to the paleolithic period. On top of the Gora Klasztorna hill traces of a neolithic settlement were found. It had a ceramics work, there also was a mint, which manufactured silver Celtic coins. Probably in the early 10th century, Tyniec was settled by the Vistulans, which some time ca. 1000 became part of the early Kingdom of Poland. The village was a royal property, and the decision of King Casimir the Restorer to locate a Benedictine abbey here (ca. 1040) is regarded as one of the most important events in the history of Tyniec. In 1259 the village was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Poland, by Tatar hordes heading from Krak√≥w towards Silesia. Complete destruction was brought again in the Swedish invasion of Poland. In 1772, during the Bar Confederation, the village was defended by the Polish rebels, fighting the Russians. After the Partitions of Poland, Tyniec, together with the abbey, was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained in the province of Galicia from 1772 until late 1918. In 1816, Austrian authorities closed down the abbey, and the complex gradually began to turn into a ruin. In the 19th century, Tyniec was a large, yet poor village. Its houses were concentrated in two areas ‚Äì around the monastery, and along the ancient Krak√≥w ‚Äì O≈õwiƒôcim road. Its residents supported themselves by transporting people and goods through the Vistula in their boats and small ferries. In 1973 Tyniec was annexed by the city of Krak√≥w.  Cyrillo- Methodian Monastery  Historically, and prior to the arrival of the Latins, the monks at Tyniec were part of the Cyrillo-Methodian Christian tradition. These Cyrillo-Methodian monks preceded the arrival of the Benedictines. The Cyrillo-Methodian tradition began in Moravia in the year 862. The brothers, Saints Cyril and Methodius, were the missionaries who established the practice of vernacular linguistic Christianity for the Moravian Slavs. This tradition quickly spread throughout the region and into the parts of what is today Poland. The monks at the Tyniec monastery practiced the liturgical Mass and read from translations of the psalms and gospel in the Proto-Slavic tongue derived from this tradition. In 1096, the Monks of Tyniec were expelled and the Papally approved Slavonic Rite Mass suppressed. These expulsions coincided with the rule of Polish Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman, who attributed the birth of his first boy to the help of the Benedictines of Saint Gilles in southern France whom he earlier sent great riches too begging for a healthy child. These expulsions paralleled events in almost the same year throughout the region, most notably at the Sazava Monastery where the Slavonic Rite Mass was also still in use at the same time as in Tyniec. There too, the Cyrillo- Methodian Sazawa monks were expelled and replaced with monks of the Latin rite. These expulsions at Sazawa coincided with the rule of the Duke of Bohemia, Bretislaus II.  Benedictine Abbey  Benedictine Abbey cloisters It is not known when exactly the Benedictine abbey was founded. King Casimir the Restorer is speculated to have re-established the Abbey in 1040 during his rebuilding of the newly established Kingdom of Poland, after a Pagan rebellion and a disastrous Czech raid of Duke Bretislaus I (1039). The Benedictines, invited to Tyniec by King Casimir the Restorer, were tasked with restoring order as well as cementing the position of the State and the Church. First Tyniec Abbot was Aaron, who became the Bishop of Krak√≥w. Since there is no conclusive evidence to support the foundation date as 1040, some historians claim that the current abbey was founded by Casimir the Restorer‚Äô son, King Boleslaw II the Generous. In the second half of the 11th century, a complex of Romanesque buildings was completed, consisting of a basilica and the abbey. In the 14th century, it was destroyed in Tatar and Czech raids, and in the 15th century it was rebuilt in Gothic style. Further remodelings took place in the 17th and 18th centuries, first in Baroque, then in Rococo style. The abbey was partly destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland, and soon afterwards was rebuilt, with a new library. Further destruction took place during the Bar Confederation, when Polish rebels turned the abbey into their fortress. In 1816, Austrian authorities liquidated the abbey, and in 1821‚Äì1826, it was the seat of the Bishop of Tyniec, Grzegorz Tomasz Ziegler. The monks, however, did not return to the abbey until 1939, and in 1947, remodelling of the neglected complex was initiated. In 1968, the Church of St. Peter and Paul was once again named the seat of the abbot. The church itself consists of a Gothic presbytery and a Baroque main nave. Several altars were created by an 18th- century Italian sculptor Francesco Placidi. The church also has a late Baroque pulpit by Franciszek Jozef Mangoldt. For more than a century, the abbey remained uninhabited. Only in the last days of July 1939, a month before the outbreak of World War II, eleven Belgian monks moved into the monastery.

The base, located near Nowra, New South Wales, was formally established in May 1942 as Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base RAAF Nowra, then was transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS Nabbington in 1944, and operated as a naval air station until it was decommissioned in late 1945. In 1948, the airfield was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS Albatross, as the primary shore base for the Fleet Air Arm. Since 2011, four squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm operate from Albatross. The current commander of the base is Captain Fiona Sneath, RAN. The base is home to the military airport Naval Air Station (NAS) Nowra , completed in June 1941. History The current site of HMAS Albatross was identified in 1938 and land was purchased in June 1939. Construction proceeded at what seems to be a leisurely pace considering it was war time, until the airfield was declared operational in June 1941. The airfield was used by squadrons of the Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers of RAAF when it opened in May 1942. Martin Marauder bombers of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) were also based there in 1942-43 for training as torpedo bombers. In 1944, the need for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy for shore bases led to RAAF Nowra, due to its proximity to Jervis Bay, being transferred to the RN, being renamed HMS Nabbington. This base was used by Mobile Overseas Naval Air Base (MONAB) No. 1 from 21 December 1944 to 15 November 1945. The base supported the British Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers by providing shore based facilities for the Carrier Air Groups when the carriers were in Sydney for repairs and resupply. At the end of the Pacific War the British Pacific Fleet returned through its main base in Australia and FAA Squadrons transited through HMS Nabbington until it was decommissioned on 15 November 1945.

HMS Nabswick (Mobile Naval Air Base / MONAB 5) moved from the nearby Jervis Bay airfield to Nowra where it operated until 18 March 1946 when the unit was decommissioned and the site was returned to the RAAF. In 1947, the RAN's own Fleet Air Arm was formed, and the Nowra airfield was chosen to be its main shore base. HMAS Albatross was commissioned on 31 August 1948, taking the name previously carried by the RAN's seaplane carrier, and the first squadrons were delivered by the Australian aircraft carrier in May 1949. Over the course of the next decades, the RAN purchased larger, faster and more capable aircraft, which led to the facilities at Albatross being expanded - workshops and test facilities for jets were installed following the entry into service of the De Havilland Sea Venom in 1955, while a new control tower was built in 1958. The purchase of A-4 Skyhawks and S-2 Trackers with advanced avionics led to more facilities being installed in the late 1960s to service them. On 5 December 1976, a fire was deliberately lit by a Fleet Air Arm member in the aircraft hangar. The fire destroyed or seriously damaged twelve of the thirteen S-2 Trackers in the RAN's possession.\\"12 RAN Aircraft Burnt\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 6 December 1976, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 21 October 2015\\"Nowra Air Station Fire\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 6 December 1976, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 21 October 2015\\"Court Martial After Nowra Base Fire\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 14 April 1977, p.9 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 21 October 2015 The Skyhawk and Tracker squadrons flew from the aircraft carrier until the carrier was decommissioned on 30 June 1982. This signalled the beginning of the end of the Fleet Air Arm's front line fixed wing capabilities, and also a scaling back of activities at Albatross. In February 1991 RNZAF A-4 Skyhawks were stationed at the base to provide the ADF with Air Defence Support and participated in many exercises often flying below radar coverage and ambushing Australian warships on a number of occasions. A total of six Skyhawks and 50-60 RNZAF personnel were stationed at Nowra until No. 2 Squadron RNZAF and No. 75 Squadron RNZAF were disbanded following election of the Labour Government under Helen Clark in December 2001. Facilities and operational units , Albatross served as the home base for the 723 Squadron, 725 Squadron, 808 Squadron, and the 816 Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm.

Since 1986 there have been Learjet target tugs based at Albatross, operated by civilian companies under contract to the RAN. The first company was Lloyd Aviation, then from 1990 to 1996 Fleet Support (a company later bought by National Jet Systems) and from 1996 until the present Pel-Air.

At the census of 2001 it had a population of 1,081, increasing to 1,153 at the 2011 Census. It is located on the A120 road, which connects it to the nearby town of Bishop's Stortford. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Bury Green, Church End, Cradle End, Green Street and Hadham Ford. Little Hadham, together with the neighbouring village of Much Hadham, are collectively known as The Hadhams. The rural village is situated on the banks of the River Ash and is characterised by half-timbered houses. The medieval parish church, dedicated to Saint Cecilia, was reconstructed in the late 14th or 15th century. The Bishop of London is the patron of the church. Hadham Hall Hadham Hall, ancient seat of the Capells and the Earls of Essex Hadham Hall, an ancient manor house situated south-east of the village on the Stortford Road, was the family seat of the Capell (or Capel) family, also Rayne Hall in Rayne, Essex. It was bought by Sir William Capel, who served twice as Lord Mayor of London, in 1503-4 and 1510. The family seat remained at Rayne, until the 1570s, when Sir Henry Capell built a new house at Little Hadham, replacing the old hall. In 1578, Sir Henry Capell welcomed Queen Elizabeth I of England as a guest at Hadham Hall; an account of the time records her visit to \\"Mayster Kapel's, where was excellente good cheere and entertaynement.\\" Arthur Capell (1608‚Äì1649) was a noted member of Parliament who was raised to the Peerage as Baron Capell of Hadham in 1641. In 1627, Arthur Capell married Elizabeth Morrison, daughter of Sir Charles Morrison, and heir to the Cassiobury Estate in Watford, and the Capell family became closely associated with Cassiobury. Capell supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War, and was condemned to death by the Parliamentarians, beheaded in May 1649. One of Capell's last requests was for his heart to be buried with the body of King Charles I of England, and after his execution, Capell's heart was preserved in a silver box. In 1661, after the Restoration, Arthur Capell's son, also called Arthur Capell, became the first Earl of Essex. The new Earl commissioned a lavish reconstruction of his father's Tudor mansion, Cassiobury House, around 1677‚Äì1680, and he moved the family seat to Cassiobury. Meanwhile, the silver box containing the late Arthur Capell's heart, had remained in the safekeeping of the Bishop of Winchester, and the Bishop presented it to the new king, Charles II of England. In 1703, a heart in a silver box was found at Hadham Hall, suggesting that the King sent the heart to Capell's son. It was later taken to Cassiobury, but since the dissolution and sale of the Cassiobury estate, the whereabouts of Capell's heart are now unknown. A memorial stone to Lord Capell is in St Cecilia's Church in Little Hadham. After the move to Watford, Hadham Hall fell into disrepair and was partly demolished, although it was retained by the Capell family, and the estate continued to be farmed by tenant farmers. The Capells used the hall to entertain important guests, such as King William III of England, who visited in April 1698. The hall was refurbished, around 1720, in the Queen Anne style. In 1900, Algernon George de Vere Capel, the 8th Earl of Essex (1884‚Äì1966), sold the Hall and the accompanying land to a London merchant, William Minet, who set about restoring the hall. In 1948, Hadham Hall was sold to the Hertfordshire County Council, who converted the building into a school. The school closed in 1990, and merged with the Margaret Dane school to form Birchwood High School in Bishop‚Äôs Stortford. Hadham Hall, now a private residence, is a Grade II* listed building. The Angel One of its notable features is \\"The Angel\\", a former pub once inhabited by the folk rock group Fairport Convention and after which their album Angel Delight was titled. Violinist Dave Swarbrick, guitarists Richard Thompson, Simon Nicol and Dave Pegg, and drummer Dave Mattacks were resident in the building, along with their wives and the band's road crew. Members of the band supported the local community by playing at charity concerts to raise money for the church organ or the Police Orphans Fund. Nick Drake also visited the premises when making his first albums (Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention played bass and drums respectively on these). The band's residence there ended in February 1971 when a lorry crashed into the Angel, severely damaging the property and destroying Swarbrick's bedroom. The lorry driver was killed in the accident, but nobody else was hurt.

The intention of an anchor is case-specific but is usually for fall protection; primarily fall arrest and fall restraint. Climbing anchors are also used for hoisting, holding static loads, or redirecting (sometimes called deviating) a rope. Types of anchors sling, attached to a handle. hex and two cams, equalized with slings. snow picket. Depending on the surface being climbed, there are many types of protection that can be used to construct an anchor, including natural protection such as boulders and trees, or artificial protection such as cams, nuts, bolts or pitons. =Natural anchor= A natural anchor is a secure natural feature which can serve as a climbing anchor by attaching a sling, lanyard, or cordelette and a carabiner. Examples of natural anchors include trees, boulders, lodged chockstones, horns, icicles, and protrusions. =Artificial anchor= An artificial anchor consists of man-made climbing gear placed in the rock. Such gear includes spring-loaded camming devices, aluminum chockstones, steel expansion bolts, and pitons. Artificial anchors may be permanent or removable. =Belay anchor= A belay anchor is used as a sole attachment to the cliff face, to support a belay or top rope. Ideally, it should consist of multiple redundant components (natural and/or artificial), none of which are likely to fail, and none of which in the event of failure would cause the entire anchor to fail. Any one component of a good anchor should be able to support the entire system by itself. If these conditions are met, the system will be essentially bombproof. =Running belay anchor= A running belay anchor is used as a safeguard in the event of a fall while lead climbing. The leader and follower climb simultaneously with protection placed in between. When the two climbers advance using a running belay, the belay is almost as secure as using a belay device and anchors because if the leader falls, all the slack is already out of the rope and the follower acts as a counterweight to catch the fall. A running belay is used as a faster alternative to pitch climbing when the risk, consequences, and likelihood of a leader fall are deemed to be acceptable. =Ice anchors= The snow picket is used as an anchor in mountaineering. It is driven into the snow and used to arrest falls. Snow pickets can also be placed horizontally in snow as a deadman, which provides a secure anchor to abseil on. Ice screws can be hand-driven into solid ice and are the equivalent of cams or nuts when ice climbing. Ice can also be protected using an Abalakov thread or v-thread. Because of the uncertain holding power of ice protection, it is sometimes attached to the rope using a load-absorbing sling or quickdraw, designed to reduce the load on protection by extending in case of a fall.  Attachment to the anchor  =Indirect= When the rope goes from the climber to the belayer. Most often used under controlled circumstances at climbing walls or when the climber doesn't have the weight advantage on the belayer during bottom roped climbs. It is impossible to escape from the system. =Semi- direct= When the rope comes from the climber to the belayer, but the belayer is attached separately to an anchor. Often used when multi pitching and the belayer is on a stance. Or when top roping and it is possible that if the climber falls the belayer will be pulled from the stance above the climber. The belayer can, with a little effort then remove themselves from the system if required. It is essential that the belayer is attached to the anchor via the belay loop at the front of the harness. Attaching the belayers harness to the anchor via the back of the harness can cause the harness, when placed under strain, to constrict inwards elongating front to back, rather than side to side. This can result in crushed pelvis and serious harm to the belayer. =Direct= When the rope comes from the climber to an anchor. A hanging belay device may be used, although it is common in this instance to just use an Italian hitch. The belayer is totally free of the system. Considerations =Force multipliers= The force on an anchor may be much greater than the weight of the climber. There are various mechanisms which contribute to excess force, including * Direction of pull, or vector pulling * Fall factor (if a fall occurs) * Stiffness (reduced elasticity) of the climbing rope and anchor materials * improper slippage through the belay device * A swinging climber, or load. * Cam-action type anchors (including nuts, and hexes) Load-sharing anchor A load-sharing (or load-distributing) anchor is a system consisting of two or more individual anchors which join together at a main anchor point to form an anchoring system. This configuration is a way to introduce redundancy and increase strength, typically for a belay anchor. If assembled correctly, the load will be distributed to each individual anchor, rather than placing all the load on a single anchor point. This decreases the chance that any single anchor point will fail, and, if a point does fail, the other(s) should still be able to hold. = Best practices = To ensure proper redundancy and effectiveness of a load-sharing anchor, some best practices are commonly observed. Redundancy Selecting independent locations for the individual anchors is considered a best practice in climbing. This may mean using distinct boulders, crack systems, or objects for the placement location of each individual anchor. Load-sharing anchors are constructed such that the overall system will still be sufficiently strong if an individual anchor were to fail. Equalization In a load-sharing anchor, each individual anchor is connected to a main anchor point. The load-sharing anchor is said to be equalized if the load force is distributed equally to each individual anchor. This is accomplished by adjusting the length of each connecting member (between the main anchor point and an individual anchor) while pulling the main anchor in the anticipated direction of the load. Anchors can be either pre-equalized, in which the anchor is statically equalized between anchor points during rigging, or self-equalizing, in which the anchor system dynamically adjusts tension between anchor points during use. Non- extension A load-sharing anchor which does not extend in the event of an individual anchor failure has the property of non-extension. This important feature reduces the potential for shock-loading the remaining individual anchors during a failure. Non-extension can be accomplished by tying an appropriate knot in the interconnecting cordelette, or by using individual slings for the equalization. The principle of non-extension refers to the mitigation of shock-loading, rather than the elongation of materials under an increased load. The principle of minimum swing is related to non-extension. The main anchor point in a well constructed load-sharing anchor will neither extend nor swing in the event of an individual anchor failure. Reducing swing can be accomplished by minimizing the inner angle between individual anchors, and by increasing the number of individual anchors. An additional technique is to place a directional anchor a short distance below the main anchor point. = Inner angle = Equalization of a load-sharing anchor, showing force distribution with a V-angle of 90¬∞ When constructing a load-sharing anchor, it is important to take into consideration the angle formed between each individual anchor ‚Äî the V-angle. Climbers typically try to minimize this angle, because a greater V-angle will produce more force at each individual anchor. If the V-angle is greater than 120 degrees, the load on each individual anchor will be greater than the load on the rope. Angles in excess of 120 degrees can create a hazardous situation which compromises the safety of the anchor, and should generally be avoided. The sum of forces on all the individual anchors will commonly exceed 100%, and in some cases, the force on an individual anchor will be greater than the load. This may seem contradictory when only the magnitudes are summed. However, if the forces on the individual anchors are added as vectors, the resultant force on the anchor system is equal to the load. In simpler terms, the forces in the vertical direction are equal to the load force, but there are lateral forces as well - which increase as the V-angle increases. The force on each individual anchor is given by: :F_{Anchor} = \\\\frac{ F_{Load} }{ 2 \\\\cos( \\\\theta_V / 2 ) }. where, * F_{Load} is the overall load force. * \\\\theta_V represents the V-angle. This equation is a special case representation of the more general anchor force equation, in which the load-sharing anchor is constructed from two symmetrically placed anchors. From this expression, the anchor forces can be calculated for selected angles in a two-element, symmetrical, load-sharing anchor. *At a V-angle of 30 degrees, each of the two anchors will bear a force of about 52% of the original load. *At 45 degrees, each anchor bears 54% of the load. *At 60 degrees, each anchor bears 58% of the load. *At 90 degrees, each anchor bears 71% of the load. *At 120 degrees, each anchor bears a force equivalent to 100% of the original load. An angle this large should be avoided for safe climbing. In trad climbing belay stations, load-sharing anchor are often constructed from more than two individual anchors, which are rarely co- planar. In these cases, each individual anchor would feel a reduced force from the above values, but best practice is to reduce the angle between the two outermost elements, and avoid angles in excess of 120 degrees.

The 2001 census indicated a population of almost 4,500. Lying to the north east of Wishaw town centre, Coltness is an area of mainly local authority built housing, divided into the two distinct areas of East and West Coltness. The two areas have their own unique identities and are separated by Coltness Road, a main road from Wishaw to the village of Cleland. = History = The area was originally nothing more than a woodland by the South Calder Water and part of the extensive estates of the Somervilles of Cambusnethan. Their lands, which stretched to the River Clyde, were sold off to pay debts. Coltness was purchased by Sir James Stewart, later Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in 1653;The Coltness Collections, p. 25 the 18th century economist James Steuart (Denham) lived here. The estate remained in the hands of his son, General Sir James Steuart Denham; the trustees of the general's estate sold it in 1840 to the Houldsworths, a family of newly wealthy industrialists, who lived in the imposing Coltness House until the 1950s. In 1855, the small hamlet of Coltness was incorporated into Wishaw. The mansion then became a residential school run by Barnardo's until the late 1970s when it was used briefly as a refugee resettlement centre for Vietnamese Boat People. The building lay empty for several years, was badly vandalised and severely damaged in a fire. It was eventually demolished in the early 1980s to make way for the Woodlandsgate estate built by Barratt Homes. The former stables of Coltness House were retained and converted to flats. East Coltness The larger of the two areas of Coltness, is the eastern half. Following the path of Coltness Road from its boundary with Cambusnethan, it proceeds almost level for approximately before descending the steep South Calder Water Valley where it meets the main artery of West Coltness, North Dryburgh Road. The housing estate of Branchalwood, built in the 1960s, contains detached and semi-detached bungalows and marks the boundary of East Coltness. East Coltness has several bus services, with First Glasgow service number 241 running every 10 minutes from Cleland to Motherwell and First Glasgow number 93 from Coltness to Carbarns. Cleland service number 248 ran by McGill's to Coatbridge (248). There is also a once daily return express service in the peak hours to Glasgow operated by First Glasgow (X11). Schools in Coltness include Calderbridge Primary (created by the joining of Lammermoor Primary and Coltness Primary in 2010), Saint Aidan's RC Primary and Coltness High School. Two churches are located on Coltness Road, St. Marks Church of Scotland, and St. Aidans RC Church. Commerce in the suburb is mainly located in the eastern side, with convenience stores located in housing areas, as well as hairdressers and takeaway foods. A petrol station, tool hire company, two supermarkets, a bakery and a pharmacy are located on Coltness Road. The former Cascade Bar closed in 2009 and was converted into a Tesco Express supermarket. West Coltness This older part of Coltness sits lower in the South Calder valley, following the path of North Dryburgh Road from its junction with Wishaw Main Street for almost 2 miles along a hilly and winding course until it meets Coltness Road near the bridge over South Calder Water valley. This quieter of the suburb has little in the way of commercial facilities and public transport, but has become a rat run for motorists travelling to the M8 wishing to avoid the town centre. Origins Designed in the 1950s by the then Motherwell and Wishaw Burgh Council to alleviate an acute housing shortage in the area, Coltness is just one of Wishaw's post-war planned housing developments, known locally as \\"schemes\\". The other areas of Gowkthrapple, Pather, West Crindledyke, Wishawhill and Greenhead, were all designed according to very different templates. Coltness was designed as mix of both \\"back and front door\\" housing stock and low density flatted accommodation, with much open green space. It was built on land which had previously been marshy woodland with some minor mining operations. Evidence of earlier mining operations are still visible, including a small slag heap in a woodland just off Kilmeny Crescent and abandoned shafts in the woodland to the east of the suburb. Some larger buildings in the suburb are reported to be suffering from minor structural problems.

He published 20 bulletins, held 28 patents and developed the Universal Product Code (UPC) in the early 1970s. He devised the coding and pattern used for the UPC, based on Joe Woodland's more general idea for barcodes. Early life George Laurer was born on September 22, 1925, in New York City. His family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, so his father, an electrical engineer, could work for the United States Navy. Laurer recovered from polio which he contracted as a teenager, nonetheless, while in 11th grade, he was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II. After being discharged from the military, he attended technical school where he studied radio and television repair. Upon completion of his first year at the technical school, his instructor convinced him that he should not continue that course of study, but that he should go to college. Laurer graduated from the A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland in 1951. He was still interested in radio and kept up his amateur radio licence. Career Universal Product Code was developed by Laurer while at IBM Laurer was a 36-year employee of IBM until his retirement in June 1987. He joined IBM in 1951 as a junior engineer. By 1969, he had been promoted to senior engineer / scientist and moved to the company's offices in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. At IBM, Laurer was assigned the task of developing barcodes for use in grocery stores. Initially, IBM envisioned a circular bullseye pattern as proposed by Joe Woodland in 1940s. Laurer realized that the pattern was ineffective because of smearing during printing. Instead, he designed a vertical pattern of stripes which he proposed to his superior in 1971 or 1972. This change was accepted by IBM management and Laurer then worked with Woodland and mathematician David Savir to develop and refine the details. These included the addition of a check digit to provide error correction. In 1973, the IBM proposal was accepted by the Symbol Selection committee of the Uniform Grocery Product Code Council, a consortium of grocery store companies. The Universal Product Code has bit patterns at the beginning, middle and end of the barcode called \\"guard bars\\" and these have been interpreted as the digits 666. When he first developed the code, Laurer noticed that the digit 6 appeared several times and that this might be interpreted as the number of the Beast, as his daughter was studying the Book of Revelation. When the codes started to appear in stores, there were protests and an urban legend developed. Laurer addressed this on his website: :Answer ‚Äì Yes, they do RESEMBLE the code for a six. An even parity 6 is: :1 module wide black bar 1 module wide white space 1 module/ wide black bar 4 module wide white space. :There is nothing sinister about this nor does it have anything to do with the Bible's \\"mark of the beast\\" (The New Testament, The Revelation, Chapter 13, paragraph 18). It is simply a coincidence like the fact that my first, middle, and last name all have 6 letters. There is no connection with an international money code either.  Legacy  Laurer was the holder of 25 patents and authored 27 published Technical Disclosure Bulletins. In 1976, he was given the Raleigh Inventor of the Year Award. In 1980, he received the Corporate Technical Achievement award from IBM. As of 2019, UPC barcodes were being scanned more than 6 billion times each day, according to GS1.  Personal life  Laurer lived in Berlin, Germany until his death in December 2019. His wife, Marilyn Slocum Laurer, died in 2013. They had four children.

He was also the chair of the department of International Relations at the Higher Party School. Biography Born in 1878 in the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of Ukraine in Russian Empire to a Jewish Family (of possibly Sephardic lineage) he said at his trial near the end of his life that \\"my father was a Hebrew teacher. He knew Talmud ... and wrote poetry in Hebrew. My mother was illiterate. My father taught me to read Hebrew, to pray, and to read Russian.\\" Having left school at 11, he went back to complete his education when he was 20, served two years in the army, then joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in Yekaterinoslav in 1901, and spent two years organising railway workers. As was common for members of the underground movements of the time, he adopted a pseudonym, Lozovsky (from the town Lozovaya, near Kharkov, Ukraine). He moved to St Petersburg in August 1903, but was arrested soon after his arrival, and held in prison without trial for a year, before being exiled to Kazan. While in exile, in November 1904, he learnt about the split in the RSDLP, and joined the Bolsheviks. He was arrested in October 1905 for taking part in a raid on Kazan police station, released after three weeks, rearrested in St Petersburg in December, then arrested twice in quick succession after escaping to Kharkov. He was in prison from July 1906 to May 1908, then was deported to Irkutsk, but escaped while he was in transit. He spent 1908-17, in Paris, where at different times he ran an employment bureau for Russian emigres, an adult schools for electricians, a bakers' co- operative, and a garage.Lozovsky's autobiography, written for the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia in the 1920s was reproduced in translation in G. Haupt and J.J.Marie, Makers of the Russian Revolution Allen & Unwin, London, 1974 During this time, he was a prominent Bolshevik 'conciliator', who wanted to reunite all factions of the RSDLP, including the Mensheviks, with brought him into conflict with Lenin. By 1914, he had either left or been expelled by the Bolsheviks, and his closest political links were with the left wing of the French Socialist Party. He rejoined the Bolsheviks in June 1917, after his return to Russia. Even after rejoining the party, Lozovsky retained an independent position as secretary of the central trade union council, and on 17 November 1917, ten days after the Bolshevik revolution, published a personal credo, a series of statements each beginning \\"I cannot, in the name of party discipline stay silent...\\" Each statement was a protest against an aspect of the embryonic dictatorship - official lawlessness, arbitrary arrests, conscription, one-party rule etc. He wanted the Bolsheviks to form a coalition with other socialist parties, and protested at the dissolution of the Russian Constituent Assembly and, later, the decision to sign a peace treaty with Germany. On 11 January 1918, he became the first prominent member to be expelled from the Russian Communist Party.The text of Lozovsky's credo, and of the resolution expelling him from the CP were both reproduced in translation in James Bunyan and H.H.Fisher (1934), The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-18, Documents and Materials Stanford U.P. He was removed from the central council of trade unions, but taken on as secretary of the textile workers' union. He founded the tiny International Social Democratic Party. When he tried to speak at the trade union congress in January 1919, to protest at the stifling of union independence, the communists shouted him down. He rejoined the Communist Party in December 1919, and never publicly questioned the party line again. When, in July 1920, the communist authorities in Moscow decided to create the Red International Labour Union (Profintern), Lozovsky's experience in the French trade union movement made him the obvious choice for general secretary, even if he cut an incongruous figure among the trade union representatives from the west. Victor Serge remembered him as having \\"the air of a slightly fastidious schoolmaster amidst his world-wide assortment of trade union militants whose political horizons did not extend very far beyond their own working-class districts at home\\". He also held ex officio positions on the Central Council of the Russian trade unions and the executive of Comintern. When Mikhail Tomsky and other union leaders came out in opposition to the forced industrialisation drive inaugurated by Josif Stalin, Lozovsky was the only member of the council to support Stalin uncritically. He was equally loyal to the party line after the rise of Adolf Hitler, when the communists were denouncing the social democrats as 'social fascists'. His children were equally reliable Stalinists. His older daughter was assigned to keep watch over the family of the Old Bolshevik Gleb Krzhizanovsky, and his younger daughter, Vera Dridzo, was appointed to guard Nadezhda Krupskaya, widow of Vladimir Lenin, so that \\"every line Krupskaya wrote about Lenin or the party had to pass through the fine sieve of Vera Solomonovna's vigilance.\\" Krupskaya called her \\"my gendarme\\". HIs grandson, Vladimir Shamberg, married Volya Malenkova, daughter of Georgy Malenkov (but was ordered to divorce her in January 1949) Profintern was wound up in 1937, when the communist policy changed to advocating a United Front against fascism, and Lozovsky was appointed Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, tasked with handling the Far East and Scandinavia. From 1939 to 1949, he was the oldest member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. During World War II (Great Patriotic War) he was vice-chairman of Sovinformburo, tasked with handling all information from the Soviet battlefronts to foreign press. In this capacity, he became a familiar figure to Western correspondents based in Moscow, one of whom wrote that \\"with a smooth, cosmopolitan veneer...and with his barbiche and carefully cut clothes, (he) looked rather like an old boulevardier, whom one could well imagine on the terrace of the Napolitain during la belle epoque In 1941, upon being told of foreign news reports that German soldiers could see Moscow with their binoculars, Lozovsky famously retorted: \\"the Germans would undoubtedly see Moscow, but as prisoners of war.\\"Stalin's Secret Pogrom p 186 He was also a member of the Jewish Anti- Fascist Committee, organised as a part of Sovinformburo, which sought to influence international public opinion and organise political and material support for the war campaign, especially amongst Jews in Allied countries. From 1945 to 1948 he was chairman of Sovinformburo. In 1943, the actor Solomon Mikhoels and others began pushing for the creation of a Jewish homeland within the borders of the USSR. Lozovsky advised that the best location would be Crimea, and helped Mikhoels draft a written appeal to the Kremlin in February 1944. After the creation of the state of Israel, Stalin interpreted this talk as a Jewish conspiracy, and ordered the police to organise a show trial with Lozovsky as the main defendant. He was arrested on 26 January 1949, and tortured.Alexander Borshchagovsky –û–±–≤–∏–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫—Ä–æ–≤—å Novy Mir N10 1993 Despite incredible pressure and despite being over 70 years old, Lozovsky never admitted his guilt or accused others. The closed trial lasted for two and one- half months, during which Lozovsky's testimony \\"shines out of this primordial darkness as the most remarkable and moving oration of dignity and courage in all of Stalin's trials.\\" The skill with which he destroyed the prosecution caused the judge, Alexander Cheptsov, to interrupt the trial for a week, twice, to ensure and appeal for the investigation to be reopened - something that never happened in any other political trial during the Stalin years. Even after he had carried out his instruction to return a verdict of guilty, on 18 July 1952, he refused to order that the death sentences be carried out immediately, he forwarded an appeal for clemency to Stalin, which was rejected. Lozovsky was executed on 12 August 1952, together with thirteen other members of Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, an event known as the Night of the Murdered Poets. He was the last and oldest Old Bolshevik to be murdered on Stalin's orders. The stenographic report of the trial was published only in 1994 and in a highly edited form. Following the release of the documents, it also emerged that Nikita Khrushchev issued a posthumous pardon to Lozovsky and all executed members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist committee stating that the trials were conducted in \\"flagrant violations of the law\\".

It was introduced to the public and later manufactured between 1985 and c. 1988. Notable features are its ability to graph functions, and that it is programmable. The calculator offers 82 scientific functions and is capable of manual computation for basic arithmetic problems. Features =Mathematical= The calculator can compute basic arithmetic functions with a precision up to 13 digits. Many functions integrated into the calculator include arithmetic and algebraic computations such as: *square roots *reciprocals *exponential functions *factorials *logarithms *trig functions Other specialized functions also implemented into the calculator include hyperbolic and statistical functions, binary/octal/hexadecimal/sexagesimal conversions and graph plotting. =Programming= Like many Casio calculators, the FX-7000G includes a programming mode, in addition to its display and graphing mode. It holds 422 bytes of programming memory, less than half a kilobyte. However the calculator does allow for expanded/additional memory by a method of reducing the number of steps within a program. This is done by optimizing the number of steps a program has to fill a single unit of memory, instead of several. The user may save any program they create or are in the process of creating in one of ten programming slots, a feature also used in the Casio BASIC handheld computer. The calculator uses a tokenized programming language (similar to the earlier FX-602P) which is well suited to writing more complex programs, as memory efficiency is a priority. Tokenization is performed by using characters and symbols in place of long lines of code to minimize the amount of memory being used. The User Manual programming catalog is written in these symbols, allowing for lengthier programs to be written with less effort and less memory. One example is a program which estimates a definite integral through the use of Simpson's Rule; this can be found within the user manual for reference. The calculator has 26 numeric memories as standard. Additional memories can be created by reducing the number of bytes available for programs. Using this facility allows a total of 78 memories maximum. =Graphing= The calculator has a built in graphing feature which is unique to its model. The calculator can display either built-in graphs that are already programmed or display a user defined graph. The user also has the option to rewrite any of the previously programmed graphs. Statistical graphs can also be generated: bar graphs, line graphs, normal distribution curves, regression lines. Display and Exterior =Display= The FX-7000G incorporates an LCD Dot Matrix design via the display window. When set into character mode the calculator can display up to sixteen characters on each of its eight display lines. This sixteen character by eight line display is screened on the 96 √ó 64 dot matrix. The LCD is not capable of colour or grey scale display. =Exterior= A black casing surrounds the calculator along with a metal panel implemented on the rear; a large plastic screen protects the LCD display window as well. Keys are labeled and printed on orange, green, blue, red, and black malleable buttons. =Measurements= The calculator's dimensions (width, height, depth) are . It has an approximate mass of including batteries. =Power= The Casio Fx-7000G needs a 9.0 volt DC current lithium battery supply provided by 3 CR2032 type cells. The calculator does not accept an AC adapter and only uses batteries. The average battery life is around 120 hours which is shorter in length compared to similar models. image:Casio_fx-7000G_FullLength.JPGThe power-on switch is a small slider half-way up the left-hand side. image:Casio_fx-7000G_KeyboardLower.JPGThe lower keys have the traditional Casio layout. The EXE key would execute the sum on the keyboard. The Ans key could be used to represent the last answer; simple iterative functions could be built up. image:Casio_fx-7000G_KeyboardUpper.JPGThe upper keyboard has the main function keys. The SHIFT and ALPHA keys are used to access the many different functions each key could be. image:Casio_fx-7000G_PowerOnDisplay.JPGThe power-on screen displays system mode, calculation mode, angle unit and rounding. These could be changed by pressing the MODE button, or SHIFT then MODE buttons, as shown on the writing below the screen.

Leechburg Area School District received more than $5.8 million in state funding in school year 2009-10. Leechburg Area School District operates just two schools: David Leech Elementary School and Leechburg Area Middle/High School. The high school building was originally built in 1922, and the elementary building in 1955. Both school facilities underwent a major renovation in the mid-1990s. This work combined the separate elementary and high school buildings into one building. The Baker building was also connected by using a sky walk. Afterward, it was possible to reach any part of the 3 buildings without traveling outside, increasing security and keeping students from having to cross a public road to get into the Baker Building. The renovation also included new doors that were not able to be opened from the outside during school hours. The renovation of the facilities cost approximately $12 million.

This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 The Leechburg Area School District received a $495,350 supplement for special education services in 2010.

This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= The Leechburg Area School District Administration reported that 61 or 7.87% of its students were gifted in 2009.

This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, Leechburg Area School District applied for and received $135,234 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide Increased Instructional Time for 87 pupils through before and after school tutoring and to pay teachers to write new curriculum and course offerings. In 2009-10, the grant was used to reform the high school curriculum, to increase instruction time through tutoring, and to fund social and emotional wellness and school safety programs.Report on ABG Funding 2009-10. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Leechburg Area School District did not apply for funding in 2006-07 or 2007-08. In 2008-09 the district received $74,691.

The school district administration was required to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3,000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006-07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated for the program. The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget. The grant was discontinued in the state's 2011 budget by Governor Edward G. Rendell. Other grants The Leechburg Area School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants, Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. Federal Stimulus grant The Leechburg Area School District received an extra $555,519 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one time expenditures like: acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Leechburg Area School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided hundreds of thousands in additional federal dollars to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.U.S. Department of Education, Race to the Top Fund, March 29, 2010 =Common Cents state initiative= The Leechburg Area School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program.

Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district's exception for pension payments.

An air track at Sir Winston Churchill High School, Calgary, Alberta, Canada An air track is a scientific device used to study motion in a low friction environment. Its name comes from its structure: air is pumped through a hollow track with fine holes all along the track that allows specially fitted air track cars to glide relatively friction-free. Air tracks are usually triangular in cross-section. Carts which have a triangular base and fit neatly on to the top of the track are used to study motion in low friction environments. The air track is also used to study collisions, both elastic and inelastic. Since there is very little energy lost through friction it is easy to demonstrate how momentum is conserved before and after a collision. The track can be used to calculate the force of gravity when placed at an angle. 2.0 m Air Track, Pasco. http://store.pasco.com/pascostore/showdetl.cfm?&DID;=9&PartNumber;=SF-9214&Detail;=1 Accessed 06 September 2007.

It was first presented by them at a meeting of the American Physical Society in NYC in 1965(?) where it was viewed by Prof John Stull, Alfred University, and Frank Ferguson, the Ealing Corporation. The original track was about 1 meter long with tiny air orifices and highly compressed air. Stull returned to Alfred Univ.

It is located in the Mazowe valley about 90 km north-east of Harare. It is an area with fertile soils hence there is high farming activity. According to the 1982 Population Census, the village had a population of 4,617. People have been living in this area before European settlers came in. The village was established in 1895 when gold was discovered in the area. It was originally known as Abercorn but was changed to avoid confusion with Abercorn (now Mbala) in Zambia. The name Shamva is derived from Tsamvi a tree common in that region. Early settlers could not pronounce Tsamvi hence changed it to Shamva. In the First Chimurenga many of the settlers died in an attack on the village. The railway arrived in the town in 1913.It is also where many African people died in fight for the struggle of independence. A vast majority of the population survives through gold panning. The area is rich in alluvial gold and most of it is found along the Mazowe basin. Gold panning is the greatest threat to the environment in the area. Shamva residents get their water supply from Mazowe river which runs about 5 km from Wadzanai Township. The main schools in the area are Wadzanai Primary School and Wadzanai Secondary School which are run by the Shamva district council. They are both located in Wadzanai Township. It used to have a country club which offered a variety of sports including cricket, golf, squash, swimming, putt putt and tennis. In the 1980s and 90s Polo was very popular with the farmers. The polo field was located adjacent to the country club but has since been converted to residential stands. Cotton, maize, tobacco, soyabeans, tropical fruits are grown in the area. The village has a brewery, a grain depot and a cotton ginnery.

The human bodies appear to have been disinterred between 1870 and 1958. During that time, a local tax was in place requiring a fee to be paid for \\"perpetual\\" burial. Some bodies for which the tax was not paid were disinterred, and some‚Äîapparently those in the best condition‚Äîwere stored in a nearby building. The climate of Guanajuato provides an environment which can lead to a type of natural mummification, although scientific studies later revealed that some bodies had been at least partially embalmed. By the 1900s the mummies began attracting tourists. Cemetery workers began charging people a few pesos to enter the building where bones and mummies were stored. This place was subsequently turned into a museum called El Museo de las Momias (\\"The Museum of the Mummies\\") in 1969. As of 2007, 59 mummies were on display, of a collection that totals 111.  History  \\"The mummies began to be exhumed from a Guanajuato cemetery when a law was enacted locally requiring families to pay a 'burial tax' to ensure the perpetual burial of a loved one. If the tax was not paid, the body was removed. Being naturally mummified, it was stored in a building above ground, and people began paying to see the bodies in the late 1800s. The law requiring the burial tax was abolished in 1958.\\" As of 2007, this museum continued to exhibit 59 of the total of 111 mummies in the collection.Guanajuato Mummies at mummytombs.com  Origin  Several mummies, 2008. Momias de Guanajuato, in a museum. A little mummy removed from the city center. Due to the demands of the epidemic (see 1829‚Äì51 cholera pandemic), more cemeteries had to be opened in San Cayetano and Ca√±ada de Marfil. Many of the bodies were buried immediately to control the spread of the disease. It is thought that in some cases, the dying may have been buried alive by accident, resulting in horrific facial expressions. However, perceived facial expressions are most often the result of postmortem processes. One of the mummies who was buried alive was Ignacia Aguilar. She suffered from a strange sickness that made her heart appear to stop on several occasions. During one of these incidents, her heart appeared to stop for more than a day. Thinking she had died, her relatives decided to bury her. When her body was disinterred, it was noticed that she was facing down, biting her arm, and that there was a lot of blood in her mouth. The first mummy was put on display in 1865. It was the body of Dr. Remigio Leroy. The museum, containing at least 108 corpses, is located above the spot where the mummies were first discovered. Numerous mummies can be seen throughout the exhibition, of varying sizes. The museum is known to have the smallest mummy in the world, a fetus from a pregnant woman who fell victim to cholera. Some of the mummies can be seen wearing parts of the clothing in which they were buried.

Many larger smacks were originally cutter-rigged sailing boats until about 1865, when smacks had become so large that cutter main booms were unhandy. The smaller smacks retain the gaff cutter rig. The larger smacks were lengthened and re-rigged and new ketch-rigged smacks were built, but boats varied from port to port. Some boats had a topsail on the mizzen mast, while others had a bowsprit carrying a jib. Large numbers of smacks operated in fleets from ports in the UK such as Brixham, Grimsby and Lowestoft as well as at locations along the Thames Estuary. In England the sails were white cotton until a proofing coat was applied, usually after the sail was a few years old. This gave the sails its distinctive red ochre colour, which made them a picturesque sight in large numbers.March, E. J. (1970). Sailing Trawlers: The Story of Deep-Sea Fishing With Long Line and Trawl. David & Charles. Smacks were often rebuilt into steam boats in the 1950s. Military use Smacks were used in British coastal waters during World War I as Q ships. Actions involving smacks include the Action of 15 August 1917, when the armed smacks Nelson and Ethel & Millie engaged a German U-boat in the North Sea. During this action the Nelson was sunk and its skipper, Thomas Crisp, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Another Lowestoft smack, HM Armed Smack Inverlyon, commanded by Ernest Jehan, sank the German U-boat UB-4 earlier in the war, the only example of a wooden sailing vessel sinking a modern steel submarine. Current use Some old smacks have been re-rigged into ketches and are now used as training boats for young sailors. Other smacks are preserved in museums or used as floating museums. The Excelsior is an example of a preserved smack. Built in Lowestoft in 1921, she is a member of the National Historic Fleet and operates as a sail training vessel. Boadicea is an example of a well-preserved smaller smack. She was built in Maldon, Essex, in 1808.

It is headquartered in Davis, California. As of October 2019, the company operates twelve of its flagship Nugget Markets-brand stores, as well as Sonoma Market in Sonoma, Fork Lift by Nugget Markets in Cameron Park and Food 4 Less in Woodland.  History  In 1926, Nugget Markets opened its first store in Woodland, California by the father-and-son team of William and Mack Stille. Mack Stille ran most of the day-to-day operations and introduced many unconventional policies to the store, such as incorporating meat departments, installing refrigerated produce cases and employing checkout stands equipped with power belts. In the late 1970s, under the leadership of Mack's son, Gene, and grandson, Eric, the company began its expansion outside the local Woodland community by opening a Nugget Markets store in neighboring Davis. In 1984, Nugget Markets acquired a pair of Sacramento Alpha Beta grocery stores and converted them into Nugget Markets, one in the Greenhaven-Pocket neighborhood, the other in Foothill Farms on Hillsdale Blvd. In the early 90s, Nugget Markets opened its first Food 4 Less franchise in Vallejo, California. In the late 1990s, Nugget Markets developed their Fresh to Market concept, pairing European-style open-air marketing with higher-end products and specialty departments, such as their Cheese Specialists, Wine Stewards, Pastry Chefs in a full-range Bakery, Full-Service Kitchen, Healthy Living Department, dedicated Seafood butcher and a Juice & Espresso Bar. In 2006, Nugget Markets leased / bought 8 former Ralph‚Äôs stores in and around Sacramento. In 2015, Nugget Markets acquired Paradise Foods with locations in Novato, Corte Madera and Tiburon. In 2015, Nugget Markets debuted its new ‚ÄúFork Lift‚Äù market concept which was a hybrid of its Nugget and Food4Less Brands within the same store. In 2016, Nugget Markets acquired Sonoma Market and Glen Ellen Village Market, both located in Sonoma County, California. In 2019, Nugget Markets patriarch Gene Stille died. In 2020, Nugget Markets moved its corporate headquarters from Woodland, California to Davis, California. In 2020, Nugget Markets was ranked #79 on Fortune's list of \\"100 Best Companies to Work For,\\" its 15th year on the list.. Nugget Markets ranked #81 in 2019.  Branding  Unique to Nugget Markets is their architectural feature at the entrance of new stores, which include a tower and/or a robed woman with a basket of food above her head.

It was designed by Dutchman Harm Lagaay along with Steve Murkett (designers) and Ulrich Bez (technical director) to preview some design features that would be on the upcoming 993 generation 911. It was also built as a gift for Ferry Porsche for his 80th birthday. The name comes from the famous Carrera Panamericana race that was held in the 1950s. Panamericana rear end The Porsche Panamericana was intended to be only a concept car, and although Lagaay hoped that his creation would be produced at least in small series in 1992, the growing financial crisis at Porsche put an end to his wishes. However the car had an influence in the development of the 993 911 Targa and Boxster. The Panamericana was shown at the 1989 Frankfurt Motor Show, after a development period of only six months. It was built on the chassis of a 911 (964) Carrera 4 cabriolet and its bodywork was built with plastic and carbon fiber panels. An outstanding characteristic of the car were its wide wheel covers with the objective to have enough room for various sizes of rims and tires, so if necessary it could be transformed into an off-road car. The three part Speedline rims used on the concept were made exclusively for this Panamericana. The roof line was homogeneously streamlined and sloped gently towards the rear engine deck. It featured a removable waterproof fabric top that could be attached by a pink zipper. Various roof configurations were possible and the car was in fact a hybrid of a targa, convertible, coupe and off-roader. When viewed from the front its style has a resemblance with the 996 and the Boxster‚Äîas could be expected, since Lagaay also has designed the Boxster. In spite of its un-streamlined wheels, its aerodynamic drag coefficient was only 0.30.

At his death, he was the oldest surviving person to have played for the Republic of Ireland national football team. Playing career Sean Fallon played for Celtic and became a legend at the club during his playing days from 1950 to 1958, playing as a full-back and centre forward. He made 254 appearances, scoring 14 goals. He also earned eight international caps with the Republic of Ireland. Sean Fallon started his football career with St Mary's Juniors and also played Gaelic football for Craobh Ruadh. In April 1948, Fallon scored two goals for the Sligo county team against Kerry in a National Football League quarter final played at the Showgrounds. He also played for McArthurs, Sligo Distillery and Longford Town. While at Longford he was capped at centre half for the junior Republic of Ireland national football team. He joined his hometown club in August 1948 In August 1949 Fallon signed professional forms for Glenavon F.C. In March 1950 Fallon joined Glasgow Celtic after impressing with his performance for the Irish League XI against the League of Ireland XI www.irishtimes.com Sean Fallon's love affair with Celtic started when the son of the Celtic legend Jimmy McMenemy saved Fallon's sister, Lilly, from drowning at Lough Gill. Fallon invited Joe McMenemy back to his house and the Scot returned the compliment by sending Sean presents of a Celtic shirt and Willy Maley's book \\"The Story of the Celtic\\". He realised his ambition when he made his league debut for Celtic, away to Clyde, in the last game of the 1949‚Äì50 season. Within a year he had helped the team win the Scottish Cup, beating Motherwell 1‚Äì0 in the 1951 Scottish Cup Final. Fallon said later: \\"As I walked off Hampden Park I felt I had got everything out of life I had ever wanted. I had become a member of the famous Celtic Football Club and holder of a Scottish Cup badge all in one year.\\" Two years later Sean would also have a cup final goal to celebrate as he scored in the 1953 Scottish Cup Final, against Aberdeen. Fallon's performances for Celtic earned him the nickname: \\"The Iron Man\\". He once assessed his own talents as a player by saying ‚Äì \\"I was just an ordinary player with a big heart and a fighting spirit to recommend me.\\" The later 1950s were a barren period for Celtic, with two major triumphs providing rare moments of joy for the long-suffering support. The first was the Double of 1953‚Äì54. Fallon suffered a broken collarbone against Hearts in October, which kept him out for most of the season. In the days before substitutes were allowed he left the pitch for twenty minutes only to return with his arm in a sling and continued playing. The captaincy of the side, which had passed to him in 1952, was taken over by Jock Stein. Fallon was back to full fitness for another momentous occasion, when Celtic won 7‚Äì1 against Old Firm rivals Rangers in the 1957 Scottish League Cup Final. The match has since become known as Hampden in the sun, a rhyme of the scoreline. Coaching career Fallon was forced to retire in 1958 through injury but his influence and importance at the club continued. He became assistant to Jock Stein when Stein took up the post of manager in 1965. It was initially proposed by the Celtic chairman Bob Kelly that Fallon should be manager, and Stein his assistant. However Stein vetoed this suggestion and threatened to take an offered job in England, leading to Kelly offering him the full manager's job. He was an integral part of Celtic's success under Jock Stein, when he was the manager's right-hand man. His powers of persuasion were often called upon to secure the signatures of promising young players who would go on to become Celtic legends, such as David Hay, Danny McGrain, Kenny Dalglish and Packie Bonner. When Jock Stein suffered a near-fatal car crash in 1975, Fallon took over as caretaker manager. He later briefly managed Dumbarton. Fallon unfurled the league championship flag at Celtic Park on 4 August 2012. He died on 18 January 2013 at the age of 90.

It was taken for the Environmental Protection Agency's Documerica program to photographically document subjects of environmental concern. Tress comes from a Jewish background; his parents immigrated from Europe. He was born in Brooklyn, New York. He The youngest of four children in a divorced family, he spent time in his early life with both his father, who remarried and lived in an upper-class neighborhood, and his mother, who remained single after the divorce. At age 12, he began to photograph circus freaks and dilapidated buildings around Coney Island in New York City, where he grew up. He has said that \\"growing up as a gay man in the 1950s was not easy, especially at school.\\" Tress attended Abraham Lincoln High School in Coney Island. He studied painting at Bard College in Annandale-on- Hudson, New York, earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1962. After graduation he moved to Paris to attend film school, but soon dropped out.  Career  While living in France, he traveled to Japan, Africa, Mexico, and throughout Europe. He observed many secluded tribes and cultures and was fascinated by the roles played by the shaman of the different groups of people. The cultures to which he was introduced would play a role in his later work. Tress spent the spring and summer of 1964 in San Francisco, documenting the 1964 Republican National Convention that nominated Barry Goldwater, civil rights demonstrations at segregated car dealerships on Van Ness Avenue, and The Beatles' 1964 world tour. Tress took over 900 photographs that were later shelved until 2009 when he rediscovered a stack of vintage prints while organising his sister's estate after her death. The work was subsequently exhibited at San Francisco's de Young Museum. In the late 1960s, he made a series of surreal photographs about children's dreams, using staged scenarios.

All-trans-retinoic acid is required in chordate animals, which includes all higher animals from fish to humans. During early embryonic development, all-trans-retinoic acid generated in a specific region of the embryo helps determine position along the embryonic anterior/posterior axis by serving as an intercellular signaling molecule that guides development of the posterior portion of the embryo. It acts through Hox genes, which ultimately control anterior/posterior patterning in early developmental stages. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is the major occurring retinoic acid, while isomers like 13-cis- and 9-cis-retinoic acid are also present in much lower levels. The key role of all-trans-retinoic acid in embryonic development mediates the high teratogenicity of retinoid pharmaceuticals, such as isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) used for treatment of cancer and acne. Oral megadoses of preformed vitamin A (retinyl palmitate), and all-trans-retinoic acid itself, also have teratogenic potential by this same mechanism.  Mechanism of biological action  All- trans-retinoic acid acts by binding to the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), which is bound to DNA as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) in regions called retinoic acid response elements (RAREs). Binding of the all-trans- retinoic acid ligand to RAR alters the conformation of the RAR, which affects the binding of other proteins that either induce or repress transcription of a nearby gene (including Hox genes and several other target genes). RARs mediate transcription of different sets of genes controlling differentiation of a variety of cell types, thus the target genes regulated depend upon the target cells. In some cells, one of the target genes is the gene for the retinoic acid receptor itself (RAR-beta in mammals), which amplifies the response. Control of retinoic acid levels is maintained by a suite of proteins that control synthesis and degradation of retinoic acid. The molecular basis for the interaction between all-trans-retinoic acid and the Hox genes has been studied by using deletion analysis in transgenic mice carrying constructs of GFP reporter genes. Such studies have identified functional RAREs within flanking sequences of some of the most 3‚Ä≤ Hox genes (including Hoxa1, Hoxb1, Hoxb4, Hoxd4), suggesting a direct interaction between the genes and retinoic acid. These types of studies strongly support the normal roles of retinoids in patterning vertebrate embryogenesis through the Hox genes.  Biosynthesis  All-trans-retinoic acid can be produced in the body by two sequential oxidation steps that convert all-trans-retinol to retinaldehyde to all-trans- retinoic acid, but once produced it cannot be reduced again to all-trans- retinol. The enzymes that generate retinoic acid for regulation of gene expression include retinol dehydrogenase (Rdh10) that metabolizes retinol to retinaldehyde, and three types of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, i.e. RALDH1 (ALDH1A1), RALDH2 (ALDH1A2), and RALDH3 (ALDH1A3) that metabolize retinaldehyde to retinoic acid. Enzymes that metabolize excess all-trans- retinol to prevent toxicity include alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450(cyp26).  Function in the absence of precursors  All-trans-retinoic acid is responsible for most of the activity of vitamin A1, save visual pigment effects that require retinal (retinaldehyde), and cell metabolism effects that may require retinol itself. Also, some biochemical functions necessary for fertility in vitamin A deficient male and female mammals originally appeared to require all-trans-retinol for rescue, but this is due to a requirement for local conversion of all-trans-retinol to all-trans- retinoic acid, as administered all-trans-retinoic acid does not reach some critical tissues unless given in high amounts. Thus, if animals are fed only all-trans-retinoic acid but no vitamin A1 (all-trans-retinol or retinal), they suffer none of the growth-stunting or epithelial-damaging effects of lack of vitamin A1 (including no xerophthalmia‚Äîdryness of the cornea). They do suffer retina degeneration and blindness, due to retinal deficiency. In addition, vitamin A1-deprived but all-trans-retinoic acid-supplemented male rats exhibit hypogonadism and infertility due to lack of local retinoic acid synthesis in the testis; similar treatment of female rats causes infertility due to fetal resorption caused by a lack of local retinoic acid synthesis in the embryo. The retinoic acid synthesis in testes is catalyzed primarily by the RALDH2 (ALDH1A2) aldehyde dehydrogenase. Suppressing this enzyme has been proposed as a possible way to make a male contraceptive pill, because retinoic acid is necessary for spermatogenesis in humans, much as in rats.  Function in embryonic development  Al-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is a morphogen signaling molecule, which means it is concentration dependent; malformations can arise when the concentration of ATRA is in excess or deficient. Other molecules that interact with ATRA are FGF8, Cdx and Hox genes, all participating in the development of various structures within the embryo. For example, ATRA plays an important role in activating Hox genes required for hindbrain development. The hindbrain, which later differentiates into the brain stem, serves as a major signaling center defining the border of the head and trunk. A double-sided retinoic acid gradient, that is high in the trunk and low at the junction with the head and tail, represses FGF8 in the developing trunk to allow normal somitogenesis, forelimb bud initiation, and formation of the atria in the heart. During exposure to excess ATRA, the hindbrain becomes enlarged, hindering the growth of other parts of the brain; other developmental abnormalities that can occur during excess ATRA are missing or fused somites, and problems with the aorta and large vessels within the heart. With an accumulation of these malformations, an individual can be diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome. However, since ATRA partakes in various developmental processes, abnormalities associated with loss of ATRA are not just limited to sites associated with DiGeorge syndrome. Retinoic acid is essential throughout an individual's lifetime, but it is most critical during pregnancy. Without the proper concentrations of ATRA, severe abnormalities can be present and even fatal to the growing fetus. Genetic loss-of-function studies in mouse and zebrafish embryos that eliminate ATRA synthesis or ATRA receptors (RARs) have revealed abnormal development of the somites, forelimb buds, heart, hindbrain, spinal cord, eye, forebrain basal ganglia, kidney, foregut endoderm, etc. Related pharmaceuticals *Tretinoin / all-trans- retinoic acid (Tradename: Retin-A) *Isotretinoin / 13-cis-retinoic acid (Tradename: Accutane(US), Roaccutane)  References   External links  * Retinoic acid bound to proteins in the PDB Category:Carboxylic acids Category:Cell communication Category:Cell signaling Category:Apocarotenoids Category:Cyclohexenes ","title":"Retinoic acid"},{"id":"3419658","text":"The Porsche 356/1 was the first real car created by Ferdinand \\"Ferry\\" Porsche. This prototype car was a two-seater open roadster with a mid-mounted, air- cooled flat-4 engine of 1,131 cc displacement that produced . While the body was an original design, most of the mechanicals (including engine and suspension) were derived from the Volkswagen Beetle which Ferry's father, Ferdinand Porsche, had designed. The aluminum roadster body of the 356/1 was designed by Porsche employee Erwin Komenda in April 1948 at Gm√ºnd and completed only a month later. Smooth and low, the 356/1 set the pattern for later 356s with one fundamental difference; the engine of the production cars was moved behind the rear axle (to reduce costs and make room for two additional seats). The car was registered by the state of Carinthia (K√§rnten) with the license plate K45-286 and made its maiden voyage on June 8, 1948.

The phrase originated in the 1700s as describing an act allowing a ship to make sail quickly in an urgent situation, either by cutting free an anchor or by cutting ropeyarns to unfurl sails from the yards on a square rig ship. Though initially referring to a literal act, the phrase was used figuratively by the mid-1800s in both the United States and England. The phrase is used as a pejorative in political language, implying a panicked and cowardly retreat, and it has been used by politicians in the United States, Great Britain, and Australia as a criticism of calls to withdraw troops, becoming particularly associated with the United States Republican Party.  Origin  To \\"cut and run\\" was defined by Englishman David Steel in 1794 as \\"to cut the cable and make sail instantly, without waiting to weigh anchor\\". He further described the practice as \\"quick but very expensive\\" but sometimes necessary, such as when the anchor is hooked on rocks and cannot be retrieved, in bad weather, when the anchor is on lee shore and the ship is in danger of embayment, or when one must quickly escape or pursue an enemy; instead of cutting the anchor by axe at the hawsehole, Steel offered an alternate method of slipping the anchor cable if time permitted, a method he felt wiser than cutting as it potentially prevented loss of anchor and cable. An alternate origin comes from the practice on square rig ships to furl the sails stopped to the yards with ropeyarns so that the yarns may be cut to let the sails fall unfurled should an urgent need to sail arise. The phrase was in use by the early 1700s, and Oxford English Dictionary cited the earliest printed usage of the phrase to The Boston News-Letter in 1704.  Usage  Though \\"cut and run\\" initially referred to a literal act, the phrase later appeared in figurative usage in White-Jacket (1850) by American author Herman Melville and in Great Expectations (1861) by English author Charles Dickens. Oxford English Dictionary defines the figurative, colloquial usage as \\"to make off promptly\\" or to \\"hurry off\\". = In politics = In May 2004, William Safire in The New York Times noted that the phrase, when used in reference to politics and war, lost its \\"lighthearted sense\\" and came to become a pejorative implying panic and \\"cowardice, going beyond an honorable surrender\\" and is \\"said in derogation of a policy to be opposed with the utmost repugnance\\". Dana Milbank characterized the phrase as a slogan used by members of United States Republican Party, and in December 2015, Robert Entman identified the phrase as one of numerous memes or slogans that \\"trigger a series of instant, clear mental associations\\" lending to the \\"communicative success\\" of the Republican Party. Linguist George Lakoff stated that the phrase is an example of the Republican Party's skill at \\"distilling an issue to a simple phrase\\" and analyzed the phrase as one that \\"presupposes that the opposite is to stand and fight\\". In the United States, the phrase saw usage by politicians as a criticism against calls to withdraw from the Lebanese Civil War, Vietnam War, and Iraq War. It was also used in similarly in Australia in reference to the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan and in Great Britain in reference to the Iraq War. The phrase was also used during the 2016 Republican presidential debates by Jeb Bush to describe Marco Rubio in reference to the Gang of Eight and immigration reform. Variations on the phrase were used by Ken Mehlman, then Chairperson of the United States Republican National Committee, to describe the Democratic Party's call to withdraw troops from the Iraq War: \\"Some are saying we need to cut and run, others are saying we need to cut and jog, and still others are saying we need to cut and walk.\\" =Military= US military slang used the expression to describe an \\"operation consisting of a sudden attack followed by an immediate withdrawal, before a counterattack can be mounted\\".

The subordinate units of the regiment constitute the bulk of the infantry elements assigned to the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. The 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment deploys anywhere in the world, within 18 hours of notification. The regiment conducts forced entry parachute assaults to seize, retain and defend airfields or other assets, then increases combat power in order to control land, people, and resources. History =World War I= The 325th Infantry Regiment was activated in the National Army on August 25, 1917, almost five months after the American entry into World War I. The regiment was part of the 82nd Division. Under the command of Colonel Walter M. Whitman, a professional Regular Army officer, the regiment, which was composed of large numbers of wartime volunteers and conscripts, also known as draftees, trained at Camp Gordon, Georgia as part of the 164th Infantry Brigade of the 82nd Infantry Division. However, only a small cadre of professional Regular Army soldiers were originally assigned to the 325th. The cadre was intended to train the many hundreds of new conscripts, most of whom recently called up and were very young and had had no prior military service, who would soon be entering the camp. The 325th, along with the 326th Infantry Regiment, which also formed part of the 164th Infantry Brigade, was composed of men from the \\"Deep South\\". Soon after, the 82nd Division was instructed by the War Department to send its men to other camps in order to help create other units. This left the regiment with only a small training cadre of just under 800 officers and men. They were replaced by conscripts from all 48 states, giving rise to the 82nd Division's nickname of the \\"All Americans\\". After further training in France, the regiment was committed to Toul sector from 18 June - 10 August 1918. After a brief rest, the regiment returned to the line to participate in the offensive to reduce the St. Mihiel salient, securing the southern shoulder of the breach. From 26 September - 9 October 1918, the regiment waited to be committed to the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. At 07:00 on 10 October, the regiment attacked to seize the Cornay Ridge, then continued the attack across the Aire River. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the regiment returned to the United States and was demobilized on 18 May 1919 at Camp Upton, New York.\\"2nd Brigade Combat Team Origins.\\" Fort Bragg: Home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces. Web. Accessed 8 November 2015. . =Inter-war period= Reconstituted 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves as Company A, 325th Infantry, an element of the 82d Division (later redesignated as the 82d Airborne Division) Organized in January 1922 at Columbus, Georgia. =World War II= Called to active duty again during World War II on 25 March 1942, the regiment formed under the command of Colonel Claudius M. Easley at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. After initial training, the regiment was reorganized as a glider infantry unit when the 82nd Infantry Division was reorganized as the 82nd Airborne Division in August 1942, and the 325th was redesignated the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment. After further training, the regiment deployed to North Africa under the command of Colonel Harry L. Lewis. The regiment was not committed to combat until they conducted a landing at Salerno, Italy, on 15 September 1943. It was not, however, by glider but by landing craft After service in the Italian Campaign, the regiment deployed to England and conducted further training in preparation for Operation Overlord. Conducting a glider-borne assault on 7 June 1944, the day after the initial Normandy landings, the regiment fought in Normandy for over a month, sustaining heavy casualties before being withdrawn to England. On 9 June 1944 the 325th earned its first and only Medal of Honor of the war, belonging to Private First Class Charles N. DeGlopper. Men of the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment moving through fog to a new position, Belgium, December 1944. Committed to another glider- borne assault in September 1944, the regiment fought in Holland as part of Operation Market Garden and later saw service in the Battle of the Bulge under Colonel Charles Billingslea. =Post World War II= After the war the regiment was reorganized and redesignated, 15 December 1947, as Company A, 325th Infantry Regiment. (Organized Reserves redesignated 25 March 1948 as the Organized Reserve Corps.) Withdrawn 15 November 1948 from the Organized Reserve Corps and allotted to the Regular Army. Reorganized and redesignated 15 December 1948 as Company A, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment. Reorganized and redesignated 1 September 1957 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 325th Infantry Regiment, and remained assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated). The regiment was again reorganized and redesignated on 25 May 1964 as the 325th Infantry Regiment. Cold War The regiment returned to the 82nd Airborne Division on 15 December 1948 and was redesignated this time the 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment. On 1 May 1965, the 325th deployed to the revolution torn Dominican Republic as part of Operation Power Pack. Sent with the mission of relieving marines and evacuating civilians, the regiment swept from the San Isidro Air Base into the capital city of Santo Domingo, neutralizing rebel forces. By the end of May, all resistance had crumbled and the regiment began peacekeeping and civil affairs operations. When the army's regimental system began affiliating separate units with existing regiments The 1-509th based in Vicenza Italy was re-flagged as the 4/325 Airborne Battalion Combat Team (ABCT) Part of the NATO's Southern European Task Force (SETAF) In June 1986 The 4/325 began to rotate to Ft Bragg NC as the 3/325 rotated to Italy to assume the duties of the ABCT. During the Cold War the 3/325th ABCT was called upon to prepare/deploy as a rapid strike force to secure hostile airfields for follow on forces in several scenarios in the middle east including Operation Prime Chance in 1987. Operation Urgent Fury On 25 October 1983, as part of Operation Urgent Fury, the 325th Regiment spearheaded the 82nd Airborne's assault on the communist dominated island of Grenada. Landing at Point Salines Airfield, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions in conjunction with other U.S. forces overwhelmed all resistance within three days. One hundred thirty eight students were rescued. During this operation, Bravo Company, Second Battalion was given the mission to assault an area known as Little Havana. The Commander of Bravo Company, Captain Michael Ritz, decided to conduct a reconnaissance prior to the assault. At 04:30 on 26 October, Captain Ritz and his recon patrol were ambushed. Captain Ritz and SSG Gary Epps were killed but the rest of the patrol, although wounded, survived. Bravo Company soon discovered large caches of weapons and equipment. Operation Just Cause In December 1989, the 4th Battalion \\"Gold Falcons\\" conducted a night parachute assault onto Torrijos International Airport in the Republic of Panama, during Operation Just Cause, the United States invasion of Panama. This operation represented the first combat parachute assault since Vietnam War. The battalion was to jump, assemble, and perform a helicopter assault to Fort Cimmarron to secure the garrison. While this was taking place, Delta Company was tasked to stay behind and secure another airport within Panama City. Gulf War Members of the regiment in a live fire demonstration during Operation Desert Shield. In August 1990, as DRF 1 for the 82nd Airborne Division, the 4/325 was called on to spearhead the deployment of U.S. forces to the Persian Gulf in response to the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait. Their mission was to secure the area north of the approach to Al Jubayl, [Saudi Arabia] and keep secure the approach to Al Jubayl until US Marine Forces arrived later in August. While reinforcements streamed into the country, the 325th along with the remainder of the 82nd Airborne Division conducted the most intensive combat trainup in the unit's history. In mid-January, after the air war had begun, the 82nd Airborne Division displaced nearly to the northwest near the Iraqi border in preparation for the commencement of the ground war. On 22 February, a day before the official start of the ground war - Task Force Falcon which comprised the 2/325https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/2-325air.htm and attached elements of the XVIII Airborne Corps along with soldiers of the French 6th Light Armored Brigade began their drive into Iraq and were responsible for the destruction of massive amounts of enemy weapons, equipment, and ammunition. The 1/325 and 4/325, as trailing elements, were responsible for the capture of several thousand Iraqi soldiers. The division is credited with playing a major role in the highly successful 100-hour ground war. The first division elements began redeploying to Fort Bragg on 7 March, and by early April the redeployment of the division was complete. =Operation Provide Comfort= On 19 April 1991, the 3/325 Airborne Battalion Combat Team, stationed in Caserma Ederle, Vicenza, Italy and attached to the Southern European Task Force (SETAF), commanded by Lt. Col. (later General) John P. Abizaid, deployed to Northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort to secure from the 36 parallel to the northern border of Iraq and protect the Kurdish population from Saddam Hussein's brutality. Saddam Hussein's regime had previously murdered Kurds by using chemical gas and other means, causing the Kurds to retreat to the mountains of Northern Iraq and Turkey and to assist U.S. forces during the Gulf War. The U.S. and its allies were worried that Hussein's regime would seek revenge on the Kurds for assisting the Americans. The 3/325's effort to secure the Kurds over a large expanse of territory during Operation Provide Comfort earned the battalion a Unit Congressional Medal of Honor. The unit only lost one soldier in Provide Comfort, Specialist Lars Chew, attached to the recon squad, who was killed in a landmine incident. =Kosovo Humanitarian Mission= The 3-325th infantrymen began arriving in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina on 18 December 1995, to set up perimeter security, which completed the first in a series of steps paving the way for the arrival of thousands of NATO troops. 3-325th ABCT was the lead element for Task Force Eagle, part of Operation Joint Endeavor. After serving as the primary protection force for Eagle Base, Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina since mid-December 1995, members of the 3rd Battalion, 325th Infantry (Airborne Combat Team), began to return to their home base of Vicenza, Italy. The first contingent of about 80 soldiers, began leaving 31 January 1996. They included soldiers in D Battery, Airborne Field Artillery. More than 800 members of the 3-325th ABCT landed on Bosnian soil, bringing with them artillery, engineers, transportation and cooks that all helped prepare Eagle Base, Tuzla, for the onslaught of soldiers moving through the base and into the US sector. During its stay, C Company temporarily operated an observation point in the Serbian sector on the zone of separation. From here the unit kept watch, monitoring for possible illegal troop movement in the zone. 3/325 Airborne Battalion Combat Team Stationed in Vicenza Italy with SETAF\\" Campaign: Operation Provide Comfort, deployed 19 April 1991, a Humanitarian mission in Northern Iraq to secure the 36 parallel to the north border of Iraq. In the northern area Saddam Hussein's regime brutally murdered the Kurds using chemical weapons after the Kurds and PKK tried to help the United States overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime during the Gulf War. The unit earned a Humanitarian Ribbon and Congressional Medal of Honor for its service in Operation Provide Comfort. Kosovo campaign:: The 3-325th infantrymen began arriving in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina on 18 December 1995, to set up perimeter security, which completed the first in a series of steps paving the way for the arrival of thousands of NATO troops. 3-325th ABCT was the lead element for Task Force Eagle, part of Operation Joint Endeavor. After serving as the primary protection force for Eagle Base, Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina since mid- December 1995, members of the 3rd Battalion, 325th Infantry (Airborne Combat Team), began to return to their home base of Vicenza, Italy.

More than 800 members of the 3-325th ABCT landed on Bosnian soil, bringing with them artillery, engineers, transportation and cooks that all helped prepare Eagle Base, Tuzla, for the onslaught of soldiers moving through the base and into the US sector. During its stay, Company A temporarily operated an observation point in the Russian sector on the zone of separation. From here the unit kept watch, monitoring for possible illegal troop movement in the zone. =War on Terrorism= Members of the regiment waiting to dash across a street in Baghdad, Iraq, as part of their mission there searching for suspected militants. Following the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush called upon the American military to fight global terrorism. The Brigade‚Äôs role in the Global War on Terror began with the invasion of Iraq. On 14 February 2003 the regiment began to deploy to Kuwait as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. On 28 March 2003, the regiment was called on to spearhead the 82nd‚Äôs assault into Iraq in support of the Iraq War. During the initial invasion, the regiment was ordered to attack into the town of Samawah to seize four critical bridges over the Euphrates River. For its actions, the regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. In April 2003, according to Human Rights Watch, soldiers from the regiment fired indiscriminately into a crowd of Iraqi civilians protesting their presence in the city of Fallujah, killing and wounding many protesters. The battalion suffered no casualties. The regiment also fought at Al Diwaniyah, Ramadi, Habbaniyah and Baghdad. After the Iraqi Army capitulated in May 2003, the 325th AIR remained in Baghdad to conduct combat and support and stability operations. Missions continued until February 2004, when, after almost a year of sustained combat operations, the regiment returned home to Fort Bragg. In December 2004, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 325th deployed to Iraq to provide security for the country‚Äôs first-ever free national elections. In July 2005, the 1st Battalion deployed to Afghanistan in support of the Afghanistan national parliamentary elections. In September 2005, only six months after the end of their last deployment to Iraq, the 2nd Battalion returned to Iraq once more to provide contingency support in Tal Afar during the Iraqi national elections. Their successes during the five-month deployment were commended by the President. In January 2006, the 325th AIR underwent one of the largest restructurings in its history. As part of the army-wide transformation program, the regiment was reorganized into a modular structure to become the 2nd Brigade Combat Team. As part of the restructuring, the brigade lost one infantry battalion ‚Äì the 3/325 ‚Äì but gained an artillery battalion, a mounted reconnaissance and surveillance squadron, a support battalion, and a special troops battalion containing signal, military intelligence, military police and engineer companies. A year later, in January 2007, the 325th was tasked with spearheading the surge of U.S. forces into Iraq to restore security to the capital of Baghdad. U.S. Army Soldiers, deployed in support of Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve, assigned to 2nd Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, use a rooftop as an observation post in Mosul Iraq, March 7, 2017. With violence in Iraq escalating out of control, the President on 10 January announced a new strategy involving an increase of forces and a new emphasis on counter- insurgency tactics. Within a week of receiving orders, the brigade had 3,000 troops, 300 vehicles, and thousands of pieces of equipment on the way to Iraq. Over the next 15 months, the 325th moved into small outposts throughout the city and waged an aggressive campaign against Al Qaeda terrorists, Sunni insurgents, Shiite militias, and other elements committed to destroying the fragile Iraqi democracy. At the same time, they devoted thousands of hours of labor and millions of dollars to rebuilding and infrastructure projects. By Christmas of 2007, violence in their area of operations had declined by 95%, and violence throughout all of Iraq was down steeply. The regiment redeployed to Fort Bragg in March 2008. In May 2011 the 325th deployed to Iraq, over the next 8 months the brigade conducted combat operations and close out of American footholds from Haditha, Ramadi and Baghdad. The brigade suffered the loss of the last American service member in Iraq, SPC. David E. Hickman, on 14 November 2011. By 25 December 2011 the brigade had been returned to Fort Bragg. In January 2017, Task Force Falcon comprising approximately 1,700 soldiers deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division assumed responsibility from Task Force Strike, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Union III in Baghdad.

Constituted in 1917 at Camp Syracuse, New York, the regiment fought in the Great War, and was later inactivated in 1921. Reactivated in 1940, the regiment fought during World War II in North Africa, Sicily, and Western Europe, then was inactivated in 1946. During the Cold War, the regiment saw multiple activations and inactivations, with service both in the Regular Army and the Army Reserve; it fought in Vietnam. Ultimately it was reactivated as a training regiment, and as of 1999, it has been assigned to Fort Benning and consists of two active battalions. History =The Great War= World War I alt=Man wearing a campaign hat. The regiment was formed from cadre from the 9th Infantry Regiment; the regiment was organized at Camp Syracuse on 1 June 1917. Initially assigned to the 4th Infantry Division, it fought in Europe during the Great War; within the division the regiment was part of Brigadier General Benjamin Andrew Poore's 7th Infantry Brigade. By May 1918, the regiment arrived at Brest, France, training until July. In late July, the regiment along with the rest of 7th Infantry Brigade, was briefly attached to the VII French Army Corps near Bois du Chitelet; it was then sent to bolster the beleaguered 42nd Division at Ourcq. In early August, the regiment fought near Bazoches-sur-Vesles during the Second Battle of the Marne. In September and October 1918, the regiment fought near Cuisy, Septsarges, and Brieulles- sur-Meuse; during this period of time Colonel Troy H. Middleton took command of the regiment, having previously commanded the regiment's 1st Battalion. It ended the war near Fays, Vosges, and served in the Army of Occupation near Koblenz until July 1919. Following the Great War, the army contracted in size; due to this downsizing, the regiment was inactivated in 1921. Although inactivated, the regiment was relieved of its assignment to the 7th Infantry Brigade in 1927, and reassigned to the 13th Infantry Brigade, which was part of the 7th Division. =World War II= Map of landings of the regiment at Safi, Morocco In August 1940, the regiment was reassigned away from the 7th Infantry Division and into the 9th Infantry Division, and was then activated at Fort Bragg. Initially, it was commanded by Colonel Alexander Patch; after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Patch was reassigned to the Pacific Theater of Operations. In November 1942, the regiment took part in Operation Blackstone in North Africa, where it fought against Vichy French forces during an amphibious landing; the regiment's Company K were the first American troops to land in French Morocco. At the time of the regiment was commanded by Colonel Edwin Randle. Following its actions during Operation Torch, of which Blackstone was a part, the regiment took part in divisional duties of monitor Spanish Morocco, which lasted into early 1943; during this time, the regiment conducted a foot march of more than from Safi to Port-Lyautey. Still in North Africa, along with the rest of the 9th Division, the regiment fought in the Battle of El Guettar, which resulted in a significant number of casualties; for actions during the battle, the regiment's commander, received the Distinguished Service Cross (he would later go on to be promoted to be the assistant division commander of the 77th Division). Following El Guettar, the regiment moved north, and fought in the Battle of Sedjenane, and soldiers of the regiment's 2d Battalion, were the first Allied soldiers in Bizerte. After Colonel Patch was promoted and parted ways with the regiment, Colonel George W. Smythe became the regiment's commander. Along with the rest of the 9th Infantry Division, the regiment was sent to Sicily, in 1943; in Sicily the regiment was tangentially involved during the Battle of Troina, which saw the 9th Infantry Division's other infantry regiments in significant combat. Remaining in Sicily after the Axis forces retreated, the regiment received orders to move in November 1943, making its way to England; with the rest of the 9th Infantry Division, the regiment trained until June 1944. The division was garrisoned around Winchester and during this time a number of personnel married local women. While stationed around Alresford, the regiment adopted a dog as a mascot, but it died when struck by a vehicle in May 1944. On 10 June, four days after D-Day, the 9th Infantry Division landed at Utah Beach. Assigned to VII Corps, it was allocated to the liberation of the Cotentin Peninsula and was the division that sealed off the peninsula to prevent additional German reinforcements from breaking through. Medical supplies for the regiment had been lost during its movement from England to Normandy, but were replaced and captured German vehicles were pressed into service by the regiment's medical detachment. By 14 June, the entire regiment had landed, and the following day the 47th began combat operations, fighting alongside regiments of the 82nd Airborne Division, attacking along a path which was near, or included, Orglandes, Hautteville-Bocage, and Ste. Colombe. The regiment reached Saint-L√¥-d'Ourville, via Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte, Saint- Sauveur-de-Pierrepont, and Neuville-en-Beaumont, by 18 June. Relieved by the 357th Infantry Regiment (of the 90th Infantry Division) along the English Channel, facing Jersey, the regiment moved to Saint-Jacques-de-N√©hou where it began its push northward to Vasteville, via Bricquebec; on 20 June it began its push towards Cherbourg, but was initially halted near Sideville by stiff German prepared defenses around the outskirts of the port city. On 22 June, the attack on Cherbourg began, with the regiment errantly being attacked by aircraft of the IX Bomber Command, and the 39th Infantry Regiment following behind its advancement; by the 24th the regiment had broken through the enemy defenses, and along with the 39th, where fighting within the suburb of Octeville. The regiment continued to fight in the western portion of Cherbourg, and by the 26th it captured German General Karl-Wilhelm von Schlieben and Admiral Walter Hennecke. The city fell to the Allies by the next day; following the liberation of the port city, along with the 60th Infantry Regiment, the 47th fought the remaining German forces in Cap de la Hague, ultimately capturing over 6,000 Germans by 1 July. By 10 July, the 9th Infantry Division was tasked to join the effort to liberate Saint-L√¥; the next day it was attacked by the Panzer Lehr Division. On 11 July, wounded men and medical officers of the regiment's third battalion, were captured by German forces; one of the medical officers would later be killed by friendly fire and buried at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial, while the other was liberated at Ch√¢teau-Thierry while taking care of wounded prisoners of war. In early August the regiment, along with the 60th Infantry Regiment, was fighting in the area of Gathemo. The liberation of Ch√¢teau-Thierry occurred on 27 August, while the 9th Infantry Division was following the wake of the movement of the 3d Armored Division. alt=American Soldiers march through a German town in 1945 On 14 September, the regiment entered Germany, at or near, Roetgen; it was the first German city to fall to the Allies. The regiment penetrated the Siegfried Line near Schevenh√ºtte on 16 September. This was followed by fighting in the H√ºrtgen Forest; during the battle the regiment captured Frenzerburg Castle. By 30 September, the regiment had lost 163 officers; one company alone lost 18 officers killed, leading to a loss of experienced leadership over time. During the Battle of the Bulge, the regiment served as a cornerstone of American resistance around Eupen. The regiment had the distinction of another first; on 8 March 1945, soldiers of the regiment became the first infantry troops to cross the Rhine River, doing so at Remagen; for its actions during the crossing of the Rhine, the regiment was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation. During March the regiment experienced multiple changes in command, at the beginning of the month Colonel Smythe departed the regiment, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Herman A. Schmidt to act as the regiment's commanding officer, only to be succeeded by Colonel Peter O. Ward a week later. By early April, the 9th Infantry Division was assigned to III Corps, and was part of the effort against the Ruhr Pocket; once again the Panzer Lehr Division attacked the 9th Infantry Division. For its actions in repelling the attack the regiment earned another Distinguished Unit Citation. By mid-April 1945, the 9th Infantry Division was reassigned to VII Corps, and fought against remaining German forces in the Harz Mountains; there they encountered concentration camps near Nordhausen. After the Germans surrendered, the regiment conducted occupation duty in Germany, which lasted until late 1946; part of the duty included a stint at the Dachau Concentration Camp. In December 1946, the regiment was deactivated in Germany. =Cold War= In July 1947 the regiment was reactivated at Fort Dix. In 1957, the regiment was reorganized into the Combat Arms Regimental System. In 1957, the regiment's 2d Battalion was relieved from the 9th Infantry Division, returning to assignment with the 4th Infantry Division. Also 1957, the regiment's 3d Battalion was inactivated and relieved from the 9th Infantry Division, and two years later allotted to the United States Army Reserves' 81st Infantry Division. In 1961, the regiment's 2nd Battle Group (the redesignated 2d Battalion) was deployed to Germany. Stationed in Berlin, the regiment remained there for a year; the following year the regiment's 2d Battalion was inactivated at Fort Lewis, and the 3d Battalion was inactivated at Atlanta. In July 1963, the 1st Battalion was reactivated as a part of the 171st Infantry Brigade. In 1966, at Fort Riley, both the 2d and 3d Battalions were reactivated, with the 3d Battalion being reassigned to 9th Infantry Division. Vietnam In Vietnam, the regiment fought in the Mekong Delta, where it conducted riverine warfare. Along with other units assigned to the 9th Infantry Division, the regiment was based out of ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp; however, the regiment's 3d Battalion was based in Ki·∫øn H√≤a province. In addition to riverine operations, the regiment also conducted air mobile operations. During the conflict three of the regiment's battalions served; the 2d Battalion was deployed from January 1967 until October 1970, the 3d Battalion was deployed from January 1967 until July 1969, and the 4th Battalion was deployed January 1967 until July 1969. For the most part the regiment's battalions were assigned to the 9th Infantry Division's 2d Brigade, except for the 2d Battalion, which was temporarily assigned at various times in 1968 to the division's other two brigades. During its time in Vietnam, the regiment conducted joint operations with the United States Navy, during which its soldiers deployed from, and billeted aboard, naval vessels. alt=Three American soldiers lying in mud in Vietnam in 1968 In 1966, upon learning of the regiment's upcoming riverine mission, the regiment's leadership worked with the Navy's Amphibious Training School, in Coronado, to gain the skills needed for the expected deployment. In January 1967, the regiment deployed from Fort Riley, by way of San Francisco, disembarking at V≈©ng T√†u. From mid- February to late-March 1967, the regiment's 3d Battalion conducted combat training, with the and the 9th River Assault Squadron, in the Rung Sat Special Zone. In April and May 1967, the regiment's 4th Battalion conducted operations in the Rung Sat Special Zone. Beginning in April 1967, the regiment's 3d Battalion deployed to the Mekong Delta proper. By May of that same year it began to conduct combat operations near Ap Bac; that same month, the regiment's 4th Battalion completed operations in Rung Sat and began operations in the Mekong Delta. On 19 May 1967, the 2d Brigade's headquarters came under attack on the banks of the M·ªπ Tho River, and the regiment's 3d Battalion was heavily engaged in thwarting the attack. In June 1967, the regiment took part in Operation Concordia, with the providing medical support. In early July 1967, operations were conducted in the G√≤ C√¥ng Province; at the end of that month, the regiment moved to Can Guioc. In August, and early September, the regiment operated in the Long An Province, supporting units from the Republic of Vietnam Marine Division. From October 1967 until January 1968, the regiment was involved in Operations Coronado V & IX, which ended when the regiment embarked on the . During the Tet Offensive, in early February, the regiment fought heavily in and around M·ªπ Tho in Operation Coronado X. From mid-February and into early March, the regiment took part in Operation Coronado XI. Following that operation, the regiment took part in Operation Truong Cong Dinh until April. Several helicopters were lost due to enemy fire, and two artillery barges sunk; the Benewah was struck by enemy fire, and one LCM was sunk. In July, the regiment's 4th Battalion conducted operations with the South Vietnamese Army's 9th Division. In October, two of the regiment's battalions conducted pacification operations in Ki·∫øn H√≤a province. =Post- Vietnam and 21st century= Following the regiment's deployment to Vietnam, its battalions were progressively inactivated. The 3d Battalion was the first to be inactivated, doing so at Fort Riley in August 1969; this was followed by the 2d Battalion, which was inactivated at Fort Lewis in October 1970, and the 1st Battalion in November 1972. This period of inactivation was short lived, as the 2d Battalion was reactivated at Fort Lewis in November 1972, while the 3d Battalion was reactivated at the same base in March 1973. During the remainder of the 1970s and into the late 1980s, the 2d and 3d Battalions remained with the 9th Infantry Division. although, the regiment was withdrawn from the Combat Arms Regimental System and was reorganized into the United States Army Regimental System. This process continued until August 1988 when the 2d Battalion was inactivated again. In 1991, the 9th Infantry Division was inactivated; due to this the 3d Battalion was assigned to the 199th Infantry Brigade, but was later inactivated in January 1994 at Fort Polk. alt=Soldiers training how to use bayonets In April 1996, the regiment was transferred to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command. From the regiment's transfer to Training and Doctrine Command, until February 1999, the regiment was stationed at Fort Leonard Wood; beginning in March 1999 the regiment has been stationed at Fort Benning. , 2d Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment is stationed at Sand Hill; the battalion falls under the 194th Armored Brigade, and Maneuver Center of Excellence. On 8 April 2013, an inactivation ceremony was held for the 3d Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment, resulting in a reduction of 44 soldier and 27 civilian positions. On 4 March 2019, 3d Battalion was re-activated in the 198th Infantry Brigade for infantry one station unit training.

He created the largest state by area in 19th-century east Africa. Mirambo started out as a trader and the son of a minor chief. He owned trade caravans traveling from the Great Lakes region in western Tanzania to the coast, mostly dealing in ivory and slaves. Through trade with Europeans he acquired firearms and money, and organised armies consisting mostly of teenage orphans.The Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 6 With his newly gained power, he toppled the traditional monarchy of the kingdom of Urambo, and installed himself as ntemi (king). The Nyamwezi aristocracy was appalled when someone who was not royalty took over the religiously ceremonial office of ntemi.The Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5 Other sources assert that Mirambo was the son of the ruler of Uyowa. His coming to power there was a contravention of the succession being matrilineal.Dictionary of African Biography, p. 224 Mirambo was based in an area with tstse fly infestations. This meant that transport of goods was almost completely by human porters. Mirambo used both warfare and diplomacy to expand his numbers of followers and the domains he dominated. He began his connections with the caravan business as an agent for his father. Mirambo built a new capital for his domains at Iselemagazi. Much of Mirambo's success came from his associations with the Watuta. This was a sub-group of Ngoni people, who were connected with Zwagendaba. With the wars in southern Africa as Shaka had expanded Zulu power, this group had been driven north, this particular sub-group settling near Bukune. Mirambo was closely associated with the Watuta's leader Mpangalala. It seems that it was from Mpangalala Mirambo learned about the age-grade military systems of southern Africa, and this led to Mirambo implementing it in his own similar system called the rugaruga. By the early 1880s this military organization had about 10,000 members.Dictionary of African Biography p. 224 The 1860s saw Mirambo extend his domains westward and conquer several of the Nyamwezi chiefdoms located to the west of his original domains with his growing rugaruga force. At times chiefdoms voluntarily joined his growing domain, being allowed to stay in power as long as they paid tribute and contributed forces to Mirambo's growing power. Apart from the Nyamwezi aristocracy, Mirambo also was an enemy of the trading community of Tabora in the kingdom of Unyanyembe. Many of the inhabitants of Tabora were Arab traders, and rivals of Mirambo for the control of the trade across Unyamwezi. These Arabs had powerful allies in Zanzibar on the coast. For most of his time as mtemi, Mirambo fought wars against his enemies. By the time of his death, he had united most of northern Unyamwezi in an alliance under his leadership, but he never managed to conquer Tabora. Mirambo in the 1870s came to be closely allied with Philippe Broyon, a Swiss merchant operating in the region. He also welcomed missionaries such as John Morton of the Church Missionary Society and Ebenezer Southon of the London Missionary Society to his domains. These missionaries viewed Mirambo as building a stable state in interior east Africa and convinced John Kirk, the British consul at Zanzibar to shift his support in the interior wars to Mirambo over the Kingdom of Unyanyembe. Near the end of his life he grew ill, and died, age 44. It is possible that he was strangled to death, since an old Nyamwezi custom was to strangle their mtemi when they became unfit to rule. He was notable for opposing the Arab allies of Henry Morton Stanley. Stanley dubbed Mirambo \\"the African Bonaparte\\" for his military talents.

History =War of 1812= Thomas Parker was colonel of a 12th Infantry Regiment that was raised in 1812 in Virginia and fought in the Canadian and Chesapeake theaters of the War of 1812. This regiment, however, has no historical connection to the modern unit bearing the same designation. =Civil War= Less than a month after the first shots of the Civil War were fired at Fort Sumter in South Carolina, the 12th Infantry Regiment was constituted 3 May 1861 in the Regular Army as the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry. It was organized 20 October 1861 at Fort Hamilton in New York. The battalion saw extensive combat during the Civil War, participating in twelve campaigns with the Army of the Potomac. During the Peninsula Campaign, the 12th Infantry distinguished itself in its first combat action at the Battle of Gaines' Mill in June 1862, while sustaining fifty percent casualties. The regiment also participated in such historic battles as Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg and six additional campaigns culminating with the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia, from late summer 1864 through April 1865 and the war's end. =Indian Wars= \\"Execution of a soldier of the 8th Infantry in Prescott, Arizona 1877\\" is the caption.

In April 1869, having been ordered to the Presidio of San Francisco, California, the regiment entrained at Omaha, Nebraska, on the Union Pacific Railroad portion the not yet finished transcontinental railroad; rode to Corinne, Utah; detrained and marched to the Central Pacific railhead; and re- entrained to complete the journey to Sacramento, California. In the 1870s, the regiment took part in three campaigns of the Indian Wars; against the Modoc tribe in California during 1872‚Äì1873, against the Bannocks in the Northwest in 1878, and against the Sioux at Pine Ridge, South Dakota from 1890‚Äì91. During these campaigns, six soldiers performed acts deemed worthy of the Medal of Honor. =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War= During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the 12th Infantry was sent to Cuba, in June 1898, and participated in the storming of the Spanish fortress in the Battle of El Caney, where the 12th had the distinction of capturing the Spanish colors. At the conclusion of the War with Spain, the regiment was immediately deployed in February 1899 to the Philippine Islands to reinforce other Army units fighting elements of the Filipino Army that resisted the United States after they defeated the Spanish at the Battle of Manila. There, the regiment participated in three campaigns (Malolos, Tarlac, and Luzon 1899) of what was to be known as the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and then served as garrison troops, not returning to the United States until 1912. =Garrison duty= Deployed along the Mexican border, the regiment repulsed Villista harassing attacks during the Battle of Nogales in 1915. On 17 December 1917 the 12th Infantry was assigned to the 8th Division at Camp Fremont, California, but was not sent overseas in World War I. In August 1918 most of the regiment volunteered for duty in Siberia and the regiment was skeletonized until replacements were received and trained. As part of the 15th Infantry Brigade, the regiment moved to its pre-embarkation staging location at Camp Mills, New York, between 23 October and 31 October 1918, but entrained while quarantined at Camp Fremont for Spanish influenza. After its arrival, the regiment remained in strict quarantine until after its convoy had sailed, and was not released until 11 November, the day the armistice ended the war. The regiment remained assigned to the 8th Division until 15 August 1927 when it was reassigned to the 4th Division. During May‚ÄìJuly 1932, 12th IR and 3rd Cavalry Regiment participated in the ejection of the Bonus Army marchers from Washington, D.C. The 12th was once again reassigned to the 8th Division on 1 October 1933 and stationed at Fort Howard, Maryland under the command of Colonels Walter L. Reed (January 1933 ‚Äì October 1934) and James Garesche Ord (October 1934 ‚Äì 1936).\\"Walter L. Reed,\\" in Whithorne, Joseph W.

Less than a year later, on 1 August 1943, the 12th was reorganized as a standard infantry regiment when the 4th Division was converted from motorized to dismounted infantry. The regiment along with the rest of the 4th Infantry Division arrived in England on 29 January 1944. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, the 12th Infantry saw its first action of the war when, as part of the 4th Infantry Division, it spearheaded the assault landing on Utah Beach under the command of Colonel Russell \\"Red\\" Reeder. Between 9 and 12 August 1944, the regiment helped defeat the German Operation L√ºttich. The regiment fought in five European campaigns through France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany. The 12th Infantry was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for valor in action at Luxembourg during the Battle of the Bulge. The regiment was also awarded the Belgian Fourragere. After Germany's surrender, the 12th Infantry, along with the 4th Infantry Division, returned to the United States on 12 July 1945 and was inactivated 27 February 1946 at Camp Butner, North Carolina. During this time famed author J. D. Salinger served with the unit. =Cold War= On 15 July 1947, the 12th Infantry Regiment was reactivated as a training regiment when 4th Infantry Division was given the mission of basic training at Fort Ord, California. In July 1951, the 4th Division was returned to line status and rotated to Germany as part of Operation Gyroscope. In 1956, the Division returned to the United States and was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington. In 1957, the Army decided that in the era of battlefield atomic weapons, tactical infantry regiments were obsolete. To preserve the historic infantry regiments the Army set up the Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS) whereby the line companies of a regiment would form new elements of the regiment. The 12th Infantry was selected as one of the historic regiments to be preserved. On 1 August 1957, Company A was redesignated and activated as Headquarters Company, 1st Battle Group, 12th Infantry (with organic companies of the battle group constituted and activated) and assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. Company B formed the 2nd Battle Group, 12th Infantry assigned in Germany to the 8th Infantry Division until 1959 when it was reassigned to the 1st Infantry Division also in Germany. Company C was allocated to the Army Reserves and formed the 3rd Battle Group, 12th Infantry assigned to the 79th Infantry Division. By the time the Berlin Wall went up in August 1961, the 2nd Battle Group, 12th Infantry along with the rest of the 1st Infantry Division had been transferred back to Fort Riley, Kansas. To reinforce NATO, the 1st Division was directed to begin Operation Long Trust whereby the individual battle groups were rotated on temporary duty to West Germany. In July 1962, the 2nd Battle Group, 12th Infantry was airlifted to West Germany where it undertook several months of tactical training and testing at Wildflecken, West Germany. It was then ordered to proceed to Berlin overland through East Germany using the Helmstedt-Berlin autobahn to test the Warsaw Pact's willingness to allow NATO forces to continue to use it. Arriving without incident in Berlin to reinforce the U.S. Army's Berlin Brigade, the 2nd Battle Group was quartered at Andrews and McNair Barracks. Because of the ongoing Cuban Missile Crisis, the battle group was almost on constant alert in October 1962. In 1963, the Army concluded that the battle group was not the answer and reorganized the infantry and airborne divisions into a quasi- regimental structure of three brigades of three infantry battalions each. Consequently, on 1 October 1963, the 2nd Battle Group, 12th Infantry was reorganized and redesignated as the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry and reassigned to the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado where it joined the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 12th Infantry. =Vietnam= Three 12th Infantry battalions deployed to South Vietnam with the 4th Division from August through October 1966. The 3rd Brigade, 4th Division, to which the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry was assigned, set up base camp at D·∫ßu Ti·∫øng in III Corps while the rest of the 4th Division was assigned to the Central Highlands in II Corps alongside the 3rd Brigade of the 25th Division which had arrived in December 1965. On 1 August 1967, the two divisions swapped 3rd Brigades. Subsequently, the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry served with the 25th through 10 of the Battalion's 11 Vietnam campaigns and received the Presidential Unit Citation for gallantry in action at Suoi Tre. As part of the U.S. draw-down, the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry was returned to Fort Lewis, WA, and inactivated on 17 April 1971. Men of Company \\"D\\", 4th Battalion, 12th Infantry cross a stream during Operation Toan Thang II, 2 October 1968 The 4th Battalion, 12th Infantry was activated and assigned to the 199th Light Infantry Brigade in June 1966 and went with the Brigade to Vietnam in December, 1966, where it was based at Long Binh near Saigon. In November 1967, the 5th Battalion, 12th Infantry was activated at Fort Lewis, WA and sent to Vietnam to join the 199th Brigade. This made the 12th Infantry unique in that the regiment had more battalions deployed in Vietnam than any other infantry regiment. In October 1970, the 4th and 5th Battalions returned to Fort Benning, Georgia and were inactivated. The 1st and 3rd Battalions returned in December 1970 with the 4th Division to Fort Carson, CO. Three soldiers from the 1st Battalion, one from the 2nd Battalion, two soldiers from the 4th Battalion, and one soldier from the 5th Battalion, were awarded the Medal of Honor. =Post-Vietnam= The CARS system was replaced by the US Army Regimental System in 1985 when the army contemplated shifting to a unit replacement system. Under the new system four battalions of the 12th Infantry were activated. The 1st and 2nd Battalions were assigned to the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson and the 3rd and 4th Battalions were assigned to the 8th Infantry Division in Germany. The concept was for members of the regiment to spend the majority of their army careers rotating between assignments with regimental battalions at Fort Carson and in Germany. By the early 1990s, the Army draw-down and its expanding worldwide peace-keeping commitments led to a decision to scrap the unit replacement concept before it was fully implemented. The 3rd and 4th Battalions were transferred to the 1st Armored Division and served in Bosnia before being inactivated in Germany in 1997. =Operation Sea Signal= The 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment \\"Warriors\\" of the 4th Infantry Division deployed from 29 August 1994 ‚Äì 25 February 1995 to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in support of Joint Task Force 160 to provide refugee camp security at Camp Alpha, Camp Bravo, Camp Golf, Camp Mike, Camp Quebec, Camp Romeo, Camp Sierra, and Camp X-Ray. The unit also served as a quick reaction force to quell any refugee uprisings, built refugee housing camp facilities, escorting refugees for medical treatment, repatriation of Haitian refugees, distribution of food and supplies, and main base security. The battalion was housed in a tent city located on the football field of the base high school with the exception of Charlie Company who was housed in tents in the nursery. Awards for participation in Joint Task Force 160 include the Humanitarian Service Medal, and the Joint Meritorious Unit Award. The 1st Battalion was inactivated at Fort Carson in September 1995, after returning from deployment to Guantanamo Bay as a part of Operation Sea Signal. The 2d Battalion was then reflagged as the 1st Battalion in 1996 after having soldiers from the inactivated 1st Battalion added to the ranks. =Operation Iraqi Freedom= The 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment was formerly assigned to the 3d Brigade Combat Team of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson and deployed with the 3rd BCT in March 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom I. From May 2003 to February 2004, the battalion and elements of 1-68 Armor and 4th Engineers was attached to 173rd Airborne Infantry Brigade while B/1-12 remained with 1-68 Armor under 3rd Brigade/4th Infantry Division. The battalion redeployed back to Fort Carson in March 2004. As a result of the transformation of the brigade to the modular concept, elements of the battalion were changed to a cavalry squadron, the 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment in November 2004. 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment was reactivated at Fort Hood as part of the 4th BCT, 4th Infantry Division and deployed to Baghdad, Iraq, in fall of 2005 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was replaced in the fall of 2006 by the 2nd BCT, 2nd Infantry Division from Fort Carson. This unit was temporarily assigned to 1st Cavalry Division to which the 2d Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment was attached until February 2007 when the 4th BCT, 1st Infantry Division was assigned tactical control of Baghdad. On 6 April 2015 the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 12th Infantry Regiment were re-flagged under the 2nd IBCT, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, Colorado. =Operation Enduring Freedom= A U.S. Army Soldier assigned to Company B, 12th Infantry Regiment watches as Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles bomb insurgent positions after a 20-minute gun battle in the Korengal Valley on 13 August 2009. In December 2001, Companies B and C of the 1st Battalion deployed to Kuwait in support of Intrinsic Action 01-02 and later in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Elements of other units from within the 3d BCT, 4th Infantry Division made up the remainder of Task Force 1-12. The task force redeployed to Fort Carson in May 2002. In May 2009, 1st and 2nd Battalions, 12th Infantry Regiment, 4BCT, 4th Infantry Division, deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom X. 1st Battalion was based in the Arghandab River Valley, west of Kandahar City, for the latter eight months of the deployment. Task Force 1-12's area of responsibility was referred to as the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" due to its significance as the birthplace of the Taliban, and also due to the inherent complexity of their mission. Much of their fighting was conducted in notoriously dense grape fields, which provided excellent concealment for insurgent forces. The 2nd Battalion was based in the Pech River Valley, Kunar Province, home to the Korengal, Waygal, Shuriak, and Wata Pour Valleys. During its time in the Pech Valley, the 2nd Battalion saw heavy fighting throughout their area of responsibility at the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains. In June 2010, Task Force 1-12 and Lethal Warrior (2-12), 4th BCT, 4 ID redeployed to Fort Carson, Colorado, after 12 months in Afghanistan. In March 2012, 1st and 2nd Battalions, 12th Infantry Regiment, 4BCT, 4 ID, again deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. This time, both battalions were based out of Regional Command East. Both battalions returned by December 2012, after nine months in Afghanistan. It was deployed to Afghanistan in February 2014 to assist in efforts to withdraw the last troops and equipment from this theater. The elements of the unit began to return to Ft Carson in September with the last unit arriving in December 2014.

The TALONS spent OIF 05-07 balancing kinetic operations with security and support operations, as well as keeping vital supply routes open through AO NORMANDY. Kinetic operations netted several high-value targets, while security and support operations allowed the local populace to assist in securing their villages and towns. In November 2006 2nd Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment redeployed to Fort Hood, Texas. Shortly after redeployment LTC James Howard relinquished command and 2‚Äì8 IN began to relocate from Fort Hood, Texas to Fort Carson, Colorado. 2‚Äì8 IN finalized the move in the Spring of 2007. LTC Doug Cardinale and Command Sergeant Major Richard Joyce assumed command of the battalion prior to it relocating to Fort Carson, Colorado. Both men assumed command and control of the unit after the relocation to Fort Carson Colorado. =OIF 08-09 IRAQ (2nd Battalion) = Upon arrival at Fort Carson, 2‚Äì8 IN began training up for yet another OIF deployment. In April 2008 the battalion conducted a month-long rotation at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California in preparation for OIF 08‚Äì09. The unit initially staged in Kuwait sometime during August. After in-processing, reception and vehicle draw. The unit occupied Camp Echo (Polish Army) in Iraq until finally the majority of the unit made the long vehicle convoy south to Basra Iraq (British Army). The unit deployed from September 2008 to September 2009 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. There were no combat related deaths during this Deployment. = Operation Enduring Freedom (2nd Battalion) = =OEF 11-12 Afghanistan = 2-8 Infantry Battalion 4th ID deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in the early summer of 2011. Upon return from Iraq, 2-8 began training and pre deployment tasks for an upcoming deployment to Afghanistan. 2-8 was one of the first Active units to re-align themselves to a Combined Arms Brigade. Originally they were two infantry companies (Alpha and Bravo Company) and two Armored Companies (Charlie and Delta). Also implemented within was a Forward support company and a Headquarters company. The two Armored companies turned in tanks and converted over to a light infantry company (while still keeping their Armored guidons and designations respectively). The Two armored companies were mixed between Tankers and Infantry along with other attachments. 2-8 Completed a Pinion Cannon rotation, Warhorse Bitz, A JRTC rotation, Platoon Live fire exercises and several other tasks before the deployment. =OEF 13-14 Kuwait = 2-8 Infantry Regiment deployed to Kuwait in the late fall of 2013.

It is located about south of Marondera, and south of Harare. The area was sparsely inhabited by the Mbire people of the Soko Clan as early inhabitants who mined iron in the Hwedza hills during the 9th-12th centuries which means \\"a place of wealth\\". A village of Wedza was established in 1910 by Colonial administration. Gold, beryl, nickel, tungsten and grayite were mined in the hills around the village but deposits were too small to make further commercial mining viable. Etymology The word Wedza literally translates to \\"The lighting of the sun\\",or \\" Twilight and myth has it that the word is derived from the location of the ancient town, which was found on the other side of a deep forest.Pre-Colonial era Wedza was called Mbire. It was a very important area because of the iron which was mined in the Wedza mountain. The iron was important for both wealth and ceremonial purposes. The iron was fashioned into hoes, axes and other farming implements which people especially young man in need of a wife required. A hoe especially was central part of the marriage ceremony. A young man could not obtain a wife if he could not present his future mother -in-law with one during the roora ceremony. Geography Hwedza is well connected to other towns by tarred roads. Rusunzwe and Gandamasungo, the famous Wedza mountain range, are some of the most outstanding geographical features in Wedza. Hwedza District boundaries are the Save River on the west and Ruzave (Ruzawi) river on the east. Other rivers include Nyamidzi, Mhare, Nyamhembe and Chineyi. Hwedza is climatically divided into two halves, upper Hwedza from St Barnabas Chisasike to Hwedza center onwards which is cooler and has average to high rainfall; and lower Hwedza which is from Mukamba through Goneso and Zviyambe East and West small scale farming area (formerly known as purchase areas) which experiences warmer to hot temperatures and lower rainfall. Even the crops grown in the two parts differ significantly, cotton and sorghum/millet do better in lower Hwedza, while in upper Hwedza the same crops would not yield much. Hwedza is also known for mazhanje/mashuku (a wild fruit harvested between late October into early December). Services and transportation Wedza is accessible by road from Harare but the roads have depreciated in quality as a result of the 'Land Reform Policy' which saw industry severely disrupted. Bus companies have stopped services the remote parts such as the areas of Chigondo, St Leoba, and Zana Resettlement. However, daily services are run by several minibus operators to the city of Harare and Marondera, usually terminating at Murambinda. The service centre (growth point) consists of a Spar supermarket, a post office, a filling station, several drinking places and is served by reliable bus services by Chawasarira, Manica, Matemba, Mushandira/Matemai as well as several minibus operators. An airstrip capable of landing small aircraft is also present. There is a clinic as well as a Hospital at Mt St Marys. Hwedza is also on the national electricity grid. The main crop grown is maize for both subsistence and sale. Economy The core business of Wedza was farming with its aligned service industries until disruptions to commercial agriculture and ranching in the area. Land Reform Project' 2000 of Zimbabwe saw white Zimbabwean farmers who inherited land from their colonial forefathers who had originally and often violently taken it from the local people driving them into the Lower Wedza villages, being driven off the farms to a fate undetermined that in turn meant vast amounts of locally employed people lost jobs and livelihoods. = Agriculture = Wedza's unique location offers a vast array of agricultural opportunity. Areas along Watershed Road leading into Wedza from Harare were known for tobacco, maize and paprika production during the warm wet season (October to March). The more southerly part of the district encompassing areas of Makarara, Zviyambe and leading into Dorowa were once a bastion of cotton farming and cattle ranching before 2000. The more central part of the district has a history of erratic rain and as such, villages located in this part of the district are often in need of food aid as they often fail to reap meaningful harvests with the unpredictable rainfall patterns. * Currently tobacco is the most dominant field crop grown, followed by groundnuts which is grown in every homestead especially in Zviyambe area. The tobacco production has expanded significantly in Zviyambe and resettlement areas giving an average output of 1300 kg / ha. The 2013 tobacco selling season has showed that most farmers have improved in terms of output and quality.  Politics  Upper Wedza which mainly consists of commercial farms, good rainfall, a Hospital and at least 3 good boarding schools namely Chemhanza, Mt St Marys Rusunzwe and St Annes Goto : The area was seized from the Mbire people by the original white settler farmers most of whom had been gold panners and fortune hunters tricked by Cecil John Rhodes and Rudd into settling as farmers under the promise of finding gold. Failing to find the gold they had been promised they were encouraged to take whatever land they needed in what areas suited them and become farmers. Through this exercise they drove away the local Mbire people into villages in lower Wedza where the rain is erratic and the soil significantly poor. Through this exercise many were driven off their ancestral lands living behind family shrines and graves through the Tribal Trust lands Act. The first Chimurenga which was won by the Rhodesian forces paved way to this exercise. The Second Chimurenga and its aftermath has for years inclined the popular vote from the district towards ZANU PF. However, despite the socio-economic challenges Wedza has continued to be a stronghold of ZANU-PF. Education Notable schools from the Wedza area are St Annes Goto (Anglican), Mt St Marys (Catholic), Chemhanza (Methodist) and Hwedza High School (government). Other institutions include Matsine, Chigwedere, Gumbonzvanda, St Margaret's Chigondo, Nhumwa, St Leoba's, Holy Spirit Ruzane, St Anderson Mutiweshiri, Makanda, Barnabas,St Augustine Chitida and Rambanapasito name but a few. Several schools are found within the district: * Primary Schools St Johns Maninga Primary School St Barnabas Primary School Chimimba Primary School chinyonga primary school makurumure primary school  St Margaret's Chigondo Primary School  St Matthias Ruswa Primary School  St Joseph's Primary School  Gumbonzvanda Primary School St Pauls Primary School St Stephen's Makurumure primary school St John's Matsvai Primary School  Chemhanza Primary School  Mt St Mary's (Rusunzwe) Primary School  Payarira Primary School  Sengezi Primary School  Magamba Primary School  Mukondwa Primary School  Gandamasungo Primary School  Rambanapasi Primary School St Johns Matsvai Primary School  Mutupwizana Primary School  Holy Spirit Ruzane School  St Mark's Goneso Primary School  St Mark's Musavadye Primary School  St Augustine Chitida * Secondary Schools St Barnabas (Madzimbabwe) Secondary School St Mathias Ruswa Secondary School  Wedza High School  Mt St Mary's High School St Augustine Chitida  Saint Thomas Aquinas Secondary  Mukondwa Secondary School  St Annes Goto High School  Chemhanza High School  Zana Secondary School  Rambanapasi Secondary School  Magamba Secondary School  Matsine Secondary School  Holy Spirit Ruzane School  St Mary's Makanda Secondary School  Gumbonzvanda High School St Pauls Sango Secondary School  Tourism  The location of Imire Game Park within the district makes it a somehow good location for a safari trip. The game park has for years taken part in the Rhinoceros breeding programme. However of late poachers have killed several of the animals including breeding cows.http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=15607&Itemid;=86 Famous residents Several people of prominence in civil society and government have emerged from Wedza. * DR.Collen choruma (rosecol industries CEO) * General Constantino Chiwenga - Zimbabwe 1st Vice President * George Tawengwa - Nationalist, Businessman * Paul Tangi Mhova Mkondo - Nationalist, part of the first group of Gonakudzingwa restriction camp political prisoners, Pioneer Indigenous Businessman & Entrepreneur, Pioneer Indigenous Commercial Farmer, Philanthropist and Conservationist. * Sunday Chidzambwa - former Warriors coach, Zifa Chairman * McNorman Chitongo - Political Consultant & Media Practitioner *Eng.

Originally a poet-performer in Pennsylvania, he relocated to San Francisco at the beginning of the 1980s. He was a member of Thessalonians and the original Melting Euphoria, had a solo project called Spaceship Eyes, and since 1996 has led the Spirits Burning space rock collective. Various cable and TV network programs have also used Falcone's music. Early recordings During the early 1990s, as electronica and ambient were coming to prominence, Silent Records founder Kim Cascone included Falcone on the first Heavenly Music Corporation album. Falcone was subsequently asked to join Cascone in Thessalonians. Along with fellow Thessalonians Paul Neyrinck, Falcone and Cascone recorded as a trio under various project names, debuting as Satellite IV on the Fifty Years of Sunshine CD. The majority of the trio's material was released under the name Spice Barons; they recorded two full-length albums and also contributed to the John C. Lilly E.C.C.O. album. In 1994, Falcone formed Melting Euphoria with Mychael Merrill and Anthony Who. Focusing on space rock, their debut recording was \\"Through the Strands of Time\\"; Falcone left the group soon after its release. As Spaceship Eyes In 1995, Falcone started a solo project in San Francisco called Spaceship Eyes. The project was included on several drum and bass compilations. The band released the single \\"Cheebahcabra\\" on Hypnotic Records in 1997, followed by the LPs \\"Truth in the Eyes of a Spaceship\\" in 1998 and \\"Of Cosmic Repercussions\\" in 2000. Three of Falcone's Spaceship Eyes pieces appeared in the 1999 cult rave film Better Living Through Circuitry. Most notably, Mind The Alien from Truth In The Eyes Of A Spaceship was used as the film's opening track. With Spirits Burning In 1996, Falcone resurrected Spirits Burning. Spirits Burning was one of his first San Francisco bands, for which Falcone played bass and keyboards. Falcone set Spirits Burning on their continuing mission just as the internet began to open up an index of collaborative possibilities that studio recordings and logistics previously precluded: the chance for content-creators to recruit musicians on an ad hoc basis across the ether; musicians they‚Äôd have scant hope of playing with face-to-face. In the space-rock community, Falcone has done particularly well out of this approach. A survey of his first 10 years under the Spirits Burning banner throws up some surprising contributors (including Daevid Allen, Porcupine Tree‚Äôs Steven Wilson, and High Tide‚Äôs Simon House). In 2017, Falcone performed live with Spirits Burning, alongside Steve Bemand, Richard Chadwick, Kev Ellis, Colin Kafka, Martin Plumley, and Bridget Wishart. Falcone played keyboards and also sang lead vocals on two songs. Various collaborations Falcone, Albert Bouchard (formerly of Blue √ñyster Cult), and writer Michael Moorcock have collaborated in Spirits Burning (under the name Spirits Burning & Michael Moorcock). This collaboration was a musical adaptation of Moorcock's An Alien Heat. Additionally, Falcone produced the 2019 Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix release Live At The Terminal Caf√© and was the executive producer for the band's Entropy Tango & Gloriana Demo Sessions release in 2012. Falcone and Bridget Wishart (formerly of Hawkwind) have collaborated in Spirits Burning (including CDs released under the name Spirits Burning & Bridget Wishart), plus have an instrumental project called Astralfish. Falcone and Cyrille Verdeaux of Clearlight have collaborated in Spirits Burning (under the name Spirits Burning & Clearlight). Additionally, Falcone produced the 2014 Clearlight release Impressionist Symphony. Collaborating with Daevid Allen, Falcone released Glissando Grooves on Voiceprint Records in 2006. Falcone and Allen were part of Weird Biscuit Teatime, which released their first album on Voiceprint in 2005, and the 2015 follow-up, \\"Elevenses,\\" which was released under the band name Daevid Allen Weird Quartet. Falcone and Allen have collaborated in Spirits Burning (including a single released under the name Spirits Burning & Daevid Allen). In addition to Spirits Burning, Allen has contributed to other Falcone bands: Astralfish, Fireclan (which included members of Melting Euphoria), and Quiet Celebration (an ambient-ethno-jazz quartet). Noh Poetry Records Falcone is a co-founder of Noh Poetry Records, a California-based independent record label, whose releases include a Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix album, as well as Where Stalks The Sandman: An Ambient Collection, which includes pieces by Steven Wilson, Praxis, Kim Cascone, Don Falcone, and others.

It emphasised the mystical interests of the period, and advocated meditation and psychedelics in contrast to hard drugs. Muz Murray (born Gilbert Murray Winfield) was prominent and editor of the magazine, and is now a world-travelling Mantra Master. Location The shop was based in World's End, at what was then the unfashionable end of Chelsea and a fair walk from Sloane Square tube station, passing the Chelsea Drug Store (where the record shop scene from A Clockwork Orange was filmed) and across the road from a clothes shop named \\"Granny Takes a Trip\\", distinguished by the mini car protruding from its first floor level. Gandalf's Garden was directly opposite the World's End pub. The site is now unidentifiable under the World's End Estate. The shop promoted a peaceful \\"vibe\\" and large cushions were provided on the floor for customers to \\"hang out\\" and drink honey- flavoured exotic teas. The basement provided not only a toilet but also an area for a \\"shrineroom\\" where homeless street people crashed during the day and spiritual meetings were held every evening. It was the first popular centre to invite teachers, gurus, monks, researchers, etc., from every spiritual tradition and practice and gained worldwide recognition. Gandalf's Garden was dispersed in 1971 into various Gandalf's Garden Seed Centres in different parts of Britain, e.g., Edinburgh and York, holding weekly meetings of short meditation and discussion, and often speakers invited from the list of address of Muz Murray's main contacts near each Seed Centre's location. Gandalf's Garden magazine The magazine emerged in 1968 and ran to 6 issues. It was part of the then-current Underground press (although they preferred to be called \\"Overground\\") as an alternative to the International Times and, particularly, OZ in departing from conventional black and white pages. In contrast to the psychedelic mayhem of many issues of OZ, Gandalf's Garden magazine was lyrical in choice of, for example, peach, light blue or pastel pink sheets with burgundy type, the colours rotating through the magazine. Articles included: * Atlantis Rising by Mark Western (issue 4) * The Glastonbury Giants by Mary Caine (issue 4) * The God'seye: The Aetherius Society by Colin Bord (issue 4) * The Third Ear Band by Legolas (issue 4) * Quintessence by Legolas (issue 6) * The Cosmic Continent by Colin Bord (issue 6) The letters page was called the \\"Seedbag\\". A touch of satire came in the form of a page \\"Oh to be in England\\" (press cuttings). Some well-known contributors to the magazine included Christopher Logue, Adrian Mitchell, Joan Baez and Spike Milligan. The front cover of most issues set the tone with \\"Fear not, for you are now entering Gandalf's Garden\\"Cover images of Gandalf's Garden magazine The introduction by Muz Murray included:First edition Introduction by Muz Murray 6 Gandalf's Garden had ceased to function in London by 1972 however Muz Murray continued to be active, touring the Gandalf's Garden Seed Centres and gave inspirational talks. Copies of the magazine have now become collector's items and are selling for anything up to a hundred pounds per issue. However, all issues are now available on CD-ROM together with photos of the Gardenscene and a history of The Life and Times of GG. The members of the team have mostly gone on to be deeply involved in various aspects of the new age movement, including shamanism, Sufism and alternative medicine. Muz Murray is known in India as Ramana Baba and teaches mantra yoga and Advaita Vedanta worldwide. Dominic Monaghan, who played Merry the hobbit in the Lord of the Rings film, praised Muz Murray and Gandalf's Garden as a major influence in the United Kingdom in the documentary film Ringers: Lord of the Fans regarding Tolkien and his influence around the world. Besides several Mantra and Yoga study CDs, Muz Murray has authored: \\"Seeking the Master--A Guide to the Ashrams of India and Nepal\\" (Neville Spearman Press) now available only in downloadable form from his website; Sharing the Quest-- Secrets of Self Understanding (Element Books/Inner Garden Publications, ); Words on the Way--A Guide to Understanding Esoteric Sanskrit(Inner Garden Publications) and Ifflepinn Island (Evertype, Ireland; ) a faerytale fantasy likened to Moomintroll meets The Hobbit. And his most recent work \\"You Are the Light: Secrets of the Sages Made Simple\\" clarifies so many spiritual mysteries that puzzle seekers, that readers are calling \\"breath of fresh air\\", with 50+ five-star reviews.

An area of particular attention was the Roman Catholic Church's role in public education, and the portfolio of Minister of Worship was frequently combined with \\"Minister of Public Education\\". After the founding of the Third Republic in 1871, the Jules Ferry laws and the 1905 law on the separation of the State and the Church, the Minister of Worship was combined with the Minister of Interior. Thus, it is in that quality that the previous Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy created in 2003 the CFCM.

Education and political career  He was educated at St. Peter\`s school in Johannesburg and Fort Hare University. After graduating with a B.Sc.degree and a diploma in education, he took up a teaching post at Krugersdorp High School.http://www.sacp.org.za/main.php?ID=2297 Active in the ANC Youth League from his university days (he was its secretary from 1953 to 1958) Nokwe was drawn into political action and served a sentence for entering Germiston location without a permit during the 1952 Defiance Campaign. On leaving prison he was summarily dismissed by the Transvaal Education Department. Subsequently, he went as a member of the South African delegation to the 1953 World Youth Festival in Bucharest, and afterwards toured the Soviet Union, China and Britain. On his return to South Africa, he wrote and spoke extensively about his experiences until silenced by a banning and restriction order served on him in July 1954.http://www.sacp.org.za/main.php?ID=2297 Having been effectively barred from the teaching profession, Nokwe moved on to the study of Law. When he qualified in 1956 he became the first African barrister to be admitted to the Transvaal Supreme Court, but was effectively prevented from practising his profession by a Native Affairs Department directive. He was debarred from taking chambers with his white colleagues in the centre of Johannesburg and ordered to find an office in an African township. Nokwe contested the order on the grounds that it conflicted with a Supreme Court rule that the offices of a barrister must be within reach of the court, but was by this stage less interested in practising Law than in his political activism. Along with 155 others, including many prominent ANC members, he was arrested in December 1956 and put on trial for treason. The cases against the majority of the defendants were dismissed by mid 1959. Nokwe, however, was one of 30 whose trial continued under a revised indictment, and he was not acquitted until April 1961. During this period, Nokwe continued his political work, notwithstanding the trial, banning orders, frequent arrests on trivial charges and on one occasion a violent police assault. He was elected secretary general of the ANC in 1958 at its 46th annual conference in Durban, and went on to oversee a series of campaigns and demonstrations throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, contributing to the growth of the ANC's mass membership and building its significance as the key organisation in the liberation movement. During the 1960 state of emergency, he was jailed for five months. After his release, he set about a programme of reorganisation. As one of the leaders of the multi-party committee he helped lay the foundations for the all-in African conference at Maritzburg in 1961, the event that marked Nelson Mandela's reappearance on a public platform after years of banning and restriction.  Work in Exile  In the early 1960s, Nokwe was repeatedly arrested and charged; his home was raided and he was placed under house arrest. Facing a long imprisonment under the Unlawful Organisations Act for promoting the aims of the banned ANC, Nokwe was directed by the underground leadership to leave the country. He crossed into Bechuanaland in January 1963, together with Moses Kotane.http://www.sacp.org.za/main.php?ID=2297 Duma Nokwe continued to work in exile in the spheres of diplomacy and propaganda, seeking to win for the ANC the recognition and respect of the international community. He spoke regularly at meetings of the OAU and the UN, and at conferences on South Africa called by various anti-apartheid organisations. He was also the voice of the ANC in radio broadcasts from nations friendly to the anti-apartheid cause, and thus continued to reach audiences in South Africa itself.  Death  Nokwe died in Lusaka on 12 January 1978 at the age of 50, after several years of serious illness.http://www.sacp.org.za/main.php?ID=2297 \\\\- See more at: http://www.sacp.org.za/main.php?ID=2297#sthash.fR7MPZUV.dpuf References Category:1927 births Category:1978 deaths Category:People from Emfuleni Local Municipality Category:Xhosa people Category:Members of the South African Communist Party Category:Members of the African National Congress Category:20th-century South African lawyers Category:South African women lawyers Category:South African exiles Category:20th-century women lawyers ","title":"Duma Nokwe"},{"id":"3419773","text":"Menora Mivtachim Arena () is a large multi-purpose sports indoor arena that is located in southern Tel Aviv, Israel. The arena is primarily used to host tennis matches, basketball games, and concerts. It is one of the major sporting facilities in the Greater Tel Aviv Area. The arena is owned by the municipality of Tel Aviv, and is managed by Sports Palaces Ltd., a company also fully owned by the municipality (which also manages Bloomfield Stadium). On January 1, 2015, the arena changed its name to Menora Mivtachim Arena. The arena is home to the Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball club, a member of the Maccabi Tel Aviv sports club. It has hosted the Israeli Super League final four, the Israeli State Cup final four, and most of the senior Israeli national basketball team's home games. It also hosted the 1994 FIBA European League Final Four and the 2004 Euroleague Final Four. In other sports, it has also hosted a 1989 Davis Cup World Group match, between Israel and France, and the 2009 Davis Cup quarterfinals between Israel and Russia, in July 2009. History The arena was opened on 17 September 1963, with a game between the national basketball teams of Israel and Yugoslavia, in which the latter won, by a score of 69‚Äì64. In its early years, the arena held a capacity of 5,000 spectators, with just concrete stands, without any seats, and without a roof. In 1972, a second floor of tiers was built, increasing the capacity to 10,000 spectators. The concrete stands were covered by seats, and the arena was covered with a roof. Further renovations through the years 2005‚Äì2007 modernized the arena further, added commercial facilities, and increased its capacity to 10,383 with permanent seating, 10,823 for basketball games, and 5,941 for concerts. The arena hosted the FIBA EuroStars all-star game in 1997, the FIBA European Champions Cup (now called EuroLeague) Finals game of the 1971‚Äì72 season, and the EuroLeague Final Four in 1994 and 2004. The arena was also used to host one of the group stages of EuroBasket 2017. Entertainment The arena has hosted various musical acts, such as: Teen Angels, Lali, Scorpions, Paul Anka, Take That, Rod Stewart, Neil Sedaka, Cyndi Lauper, LMFAO, Westlife, Five, Philipp Kirkorov, Juan Luis Guerra, Natalia Oreiro, Alicia Keys, Charles Aznavour, Sean Paul, and Julio and Enrique Iglesias. The Mamma Mia! international tour played 24 shows at the venue as well. The arena also hosted shows of the international tour Alegr√≠a, of Cirque du Soleil. On December 19 and 20, 2015, the arena hosted comedian, Jerry Seinfeld, in his first live performance in Israel. All four shows of the comedian were sold out.

Geography =Location= Niedernhausen lies in the Rhein- Taunus Nature Park in the west of the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region north of Wiesbaden. The main centre of Niedernhausen (which alone is home to more than half the community's inhabitants) and the outlying centre of K√∂nigshofen stretch along the slopes of a dale. The heart of the community is found in the bottom of the dale. The community is surrounded by mixed forest covering 60% of the municipal area. View over Niedernhausen with the Thei√ü valley bridge Niedernhausen lies on the south flank of the Taunus low mountain range, a fold range that stretches from the Niederwald (\\"Lower Forest\\") near R√ºdesheim am Rhein towards the northeast, on into the Wetterau near Bad Nauheim. This range is subdivided by two gaps, namely the Idstein Basin and the Saalburg Basin, into three parts: the Rheingau-Taunus, the High Taunus and the Wetterau- Taunus. The outliers of the Idstein Basin reach as far as Niedernhausen in the form of the Autal, putting the community right on the east-west dividing line between the Rheingau-Taunus and the High Taunus. Overview map of the Niedernhausen municipal area with its centres The main ridge of the Taunus, which at the same time forms the watershed between the Rhine and Main drainage basin in the south and the Lahn drainage basin in the north, runs through the municipal area from southwest to northeast. Parts of this ridge and also parts of the Rheingau-Taunus are the Hohe Kanzel (\\"High Pulpit\\"), at 592 m above sea level the community's highest elevation, and the Lenzenberg (492 m above sea level). South of these heights stretches the local recreation area and nature conservation area of Thei√ütal (or Theisstal) to the northeast on into the heart of Niedernhausen, north of which is the Engenhahn Valley (Engenhahner Tal), in which also runs the highway from high-lying Engenhahn to Niederseelbach in the outliers of the Idstein Basin. West of Niederseelbach stretches the Niedernhausen Basin. In the pit of the basin lies the community's core (lowest point near the town hall at 254 m above sea level), on the south slopes K√∂nigshofen, and on the north the new municipal developments of Niedernhausen along with the outlying centre of Oberjosbach. The massif, which rises north of Niedernhausen, Oberjosbach and the more westerly Oberseelbach, is well into the High Taunus, and was once called Eichelberger Mark. It peaks with the Buchwaldskopf (492 m above sea level) and the Gro√üer Lindenkopf (499 m above sea level). The highest elevation among the mountains south of the Thei√ütal (or Thei√ü Valley) is the Hahnberg (447 m above sea level). Through the municipal area run four major streams. The biggest is the Daisbach, which comes from Engenhahn through the Engenhahn Valley to Niederseelbach and goes on through the Autal through Niedernhausen. It leaves the municipal area in the southwest going towards Niederjosbach and Eppstein, whereafter it is known as the Schwarzbach, emptying into the Main near Okriftel. The Thei√übach rises in the Thei√ütal and empties into the Daisbach at Niedernhausen town hall. The Seelbach rises near Lenzhahn, flows through Oberseelbach and empties into the Daisbach near Niederseelbach. The Josbach rises near Oberjosbach, and in Niederjosbach likewise empties into the Daisbach. Through the municipal area likewise run the tracks of the Main-Lahn railway, east-west through the Autal, from Frankfurt to Limburg an der Lahn. Running parallel thereto are the A 3 and the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line, which each cross the Thei√ütal on an imposing bridge. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" + Mountains in the Niedernhausen municipal area - style=\\"background:#b0c4de;\\" !Peak !Height !Range - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  Hohe Kanzel  592 m above sea level  Rheingau-Taunus - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Gro√üer Lindenkopf  499 m above sea level  Rheingau-Taunus - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Buchwaldskopf  492 m above sea level  Rheingau-Taunus - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Lenzenberg  462 m above sea level  Rheingau-Taunus - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Hahnberg  447 m above sea level  Rheingau-Taunus - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Hellenberg  436 m above sea level  Rheingau-Taunus - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  Eselskopf  391 m above sea level  Rheingau-Taunus } =Geology= The mountain ridge, to which the Hohe Kanzel also belongs, is made of hard, weathered, but also cracked and permeable quartzite rock. Its layers are set steeply and often vertically. This yellowish-white, sometimes cherry-red-streaked Taunus quartzite arose from sandy sea depositions. Through the mountain range's compression and the attendant exothermic reaction, the original sedimentary stone changed into metamorphic quartzite. In some spots in the Niedernhausen municipal area are found outcrops of this quartzite. Among these are a block on the peak of the Hohe Kanzel and the 479 m-high Hohler Stein (‚ÄúHollow Stone‚Äù) between Niedernhausen and Lenzhahn. The latter was placed under nature conservation in 1929. Near the Niedernhausen Autobahn on-ramp lies the so-called Grauer Stein (‚ÄúGrey Stone‚Äù), near which is also found an old quartzite mine. Timber-frame houses in the outlying centre of Oberjosbach =Constituent communities= Niedernhausen's Ortsteile are the formerly self-governing communities of Engenhahn, K√∂nigshofen, Niedernhausen, Niederseelbach, Oberjosbach and Oberseelbach. In Niedernhausen alone live more than half the inhabitants. This is also where the great building areas of Lenzhahner Weg and Sch√§fersberg are found. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" + Niedernhausen's centres - style=\\"background:#b0c4de;\\" !Centre !Population - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Niedernhausen 1  7,700 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Oberjosbach  2,150 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  Niederseelbach  2,000 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  K√∂nigshofen  1,900 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Engenhahn 2  1,350 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Oberseelbach  450 } 1\\\\. with the building areas of Lenzhahner Weg and Sch√§fersberg 2\\\\. with the building area of Wildpark =Neighbouring communities= Niedernhausen borders in the west on the town of Taunusstein, in the west and north on the town of Idstein (both in the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis), in the east on the town of Eppstein (Main-Taunus-Kreis) and in the south on the district- free city of Wiesbaden, the state capital. History = Beginnings and Roman border area (1st century AD) = Reconstructed Roman watchtower on the Dasbach Heights between Idstein and Oberseelbach In 1974, a stone hatchet was found near Oberjosbach that was dated to the time of the ‚ÄúBeaker Cultures‚Äù of the New Stone Age (2300-1600 BC). There is no hint as to whether the area was settled, although it does prove a human presence. About the beginning of the Christian Era, the Romans came into what is now the Niedernhausen municipal area. Beginning in AD 86 they began work on the Limes between the places now known as Oberseelbach and Idstein; on 15 July 2005, UNESCO proclaimed it a World Heritage Site. The Niedernhausen area lay on the Roman side of the frontier, and what would later become Idstein on the Germanic side. On the Dasbach Heights, on the highway between Niedernhausen and Idstein, a replica of a Roman watchtower was built right near Niedernhausen municipal limits on the occasion of the 2002 Hessentag, state festival in Idstein. Some 2 km north of Oberseelbach, near Idstein-Heftrich, was the Roman castrum of Alteburg. = First traces in the Middle Ages and documentary mentions (1196‚Äì1283) = Niedernhausen's two original centres were the parishes of Oberjosbach and Niederseelbach. The former had its first documentary mention in 1196 as Oberjosbach ‚Äúaugmented with God‚Äôs grace to the populace and estate‚Äù and thereby acquiring the ‚Äúfull freedom of a mother church‚Äù from the Archbishop of Mainz. Saint Michael's parish actually had no existence in the Middle Ages. However, the church developed into a church centre. The settlement of Oberjosbach, on the other hand, might have existed as early as the 10th century, which would make it the oldest in the current municipal area. The old Johanneskirche (Saint John's Church) in the meadowlands near Niederseelbach was, however, the hub of the so-called Seelbacher Grund, which comprised the centres of Oberseelbach, Engenhahn, Lenzhahn, K√∂nigshofen and Niedernhausen. Moreover, the parish priest at Niederseelbach was also responsible for the branch church in Dasbach. If the Seelbacher Grund also belonged to the parish of Oberjosbach, the ways were parted about 1220 when the House of Nassau launched the independent parish of Niederseelbach. The church's origins may well reach back into Carolingian times about 800, when a rural church stood here. Catholic Church, rebuilt after the Second World War, in Oberjosbach Engenhahn's founding goes back to the founding of the Bleidenstadt Monastery in 775, within whose bounds so-called Meierh√∂fe (sing. Meierhof, roughly ‚Äúchamberlain‚Äôs estate‚Äù) were built. A monk by the name of Enicho founded one such place, thereby becoming Engenhahn's namesake, with the name first appearing as Enicho im Hag or Unechenhagin. The place had its first documentary mention in 1221. Oberseelbach first cropped up, along with Lenzhahn, as Medietas Ville superioris Selebach in a Schlo√üborn tithe register. This can be dated to some time between 1226 and 1233. K√∂nigshofen and Niedernhausen had their first documentary mentions about 1220 in a directory from Saint Stephen's as Villa in Kunigishoue and Niederinhusin respectively. = Border disputes between Nassau-Idstein and Eppstein (1283‚Äì1806) = From the Early Middle Ages, the Niedernhausen municipal area was in the thick of the border disputes between two lordly houses, Nassau and Eppstein. These came to a head in the 13th century with a feud, during which the new parish church at Oberjosbach was once again destroyed, only being built anew and reconsecrated in 1321. The feud was settled in the 1283 S√ºhnevertrag (‚ÄúAtonement Treaty‚Äù), in which territorial sovereignty was newly ordered. Nevertheless, the rather fluid border between the two houses‚Äô domains was not truly fixed until some time about 1500. The small settlement of Obernhausen lying in the border area, a counterpart to Niedernhausen (Ober‚Äî and Nieder‚Äî are German for ‚ÄúUpper‚Äù and ‚ÄúNether‚Äù or ‚ÄúLower‚Äù) fell victim during this time to the Plague. By 1544, the settlement no longer existed. The Reformation led to a further separation between the places in the Seelbacher Grund and Oberjosbach. The latter, after having been Protestant from 1540 to 1604, became Catholic again because it had belonged to Electoral Mainz since 1581. The parishioners in Niederseelbach, on the other hand, became Lutheran as of 1581, matching their lords, the Counts of Nassau-Idstein, in religious affiliation. This configuration remained in place even by the end of the Thirty Years' War. The war had wrought great misfortune on the villages: Niedernhausen, K√∂nigshofen and Engenhahn were almost utterly depopulated; in Oberseelbach only 14 inhabitants survived. After the Peace of Westphalia, Count Johannes of Nassau-Idstein settled Walloons from the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge in the county's emptied centres, among them Niedernhausen, K√∂nigshofen and Engenhahn. These settlers he gave leave to keep their Catholic faith, while nevertheless putting them under Niedernhausen's Lutheran priest. Still today, a few Wallonian surnames can be found in Niedernhausen. The Elector- Archbishop of Mainz, Anselm Franz von Ingelheim, replaced the chapel in Oberjosbach with a church in the Renaissance style in 1680. In 1723 the border between Idstein and Eppstein was marked with border stones, which on one side showed the Lion of Nassau and on the other the Wheel of Mainz. These stones can still be seen between Niedernhausen and Oberjosbach. In 1728, the Elector- Archbishop Lothar Franz von Sch√∂nborn revived the parish in Oberjosbach, in which the Catholics of the Seelbacher Grund found a new home, the border notwithstanding. The school in Niederseelbach had its first documentary mention in 1778. It was attended by children from the surrounding villages. = Duchy of Nassau, railway building and open-air resort (1806‚Äì1914) = In 1806, the Duchy of Nassau was founded, rendering the border between Niedernhausen and Oberjosbach, which had been in force since the Middle Ages, meaningless. In 1859, Oberseelbach, together with the neighbouring places Dasbach and Lenzhahn, both of which now belong to Idstein, founded a school board. The new school building was opened in 1863. The great upswing came with the building of the railway, including Niedernhausen station in 1877. The Main-Lahn Railway thereafter linked the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region with Limburg an der Lahn. When the opening of the L√§ndches Railway to Wiesbaden opened in 1879, Niedernhausen even became a railway junction. The first railway station building arose in 1880, and in 1906 a new, representative building went up, and with it also came track and handling facilities for the steam locomotives. An old locomotive shed with a watertower is still preserved. In 1913, the line was double-tracked. In 1903, Niederseelbach acquired its own halt, which was, however, closed again in 1971. The population, which hitherto had for centuries been oriented towards agriculture and forest endeavours, now had the opportunity to pursue industrial occupations or work in crafts in the cities and towns that could now easily be reached. Not only Niedernhausen and Niederseelbach, but also the outlying villages profited from this. Given the now easy access, Niedernhausen even managed to rise to become a Luftkurort (roughly, ‚Äúopen-air resort‚Äù), which resort guests could comfortably reach by rail. Many old hotel villas from the Gr√ºnderzeit in the former resort quarter at the Sch√∂ne Aussicht (‚ÄúLovely View‚Äù) bear witness to this time. Moreover, the old youth hostel is still to be found on Frankfurter Stra√üe. The unofficial resort house was the former Pulverm√ºhle (‚ÄúPowder Mill‚Äù) in the Thei√ü valley on the boundary between K√∂nigshofen and Niedernhausen. About the turn of the 20th century, Niedernhausen's population reached about 1,200. = Weimar Republic, Third Reich and Second World War (1918‚Äì1945) = After the First World War, the Rhine's left bank along with the three bridgeheads, Cologne, Koblenz and Mainz and also areas within 30 km of each of them, were occupied by the Allies. Niedernhausen and the places that are now its outlying centres found themselves under French occupation; at times several hundred soldiers were present. From September 1919, troops had been withdrawn from the smaller centres. In November 1919, the first community representative elections were held, at which for the first time women were also allowed to vote. Even after the First World War, many resort guests and summer visitors came to Niedernhausen, among them many Jews. Perhaps these circumstances and the Walloons‚Äô settling in Niedernhausen centuries earlier explain why the presence of foreign cultures was considered normal. Whatever the truth is, there are no stories of political activity from the time of the Third Reich worth mentioning, although there was a so-called F√ºhrer-Schule which served as a training centre for the Hitler Youth. As in many German municipalities, there were renamings in Niedernhausen of streets and buildings: there was a Hindenburgplatz, and part of Niederseelbacher Stra√üe in K√∂nigshofen and Austra√üe in Niedernhausen were each named Adolf-Hitler-Stra√üe. The teachers at the schools, according to reports from the pupils, seem all to have been quite in line with the Party and spurred their pupils into gathering relief supplies. There were, however, scattered reports here of voices critical of the r√©gime. A staffer at the F√ºhrer-Schule, for instance, cancelled the subscription to the propaganda newspaper Der St√ºrmer out of hand, although she had to face consequences for this. When the mayor ordered the community's evacuation shortly before the war ended, the populace simply laughed at him. With the building of the Autobahn between 1937 and 1939 came a further upswing, as Niedernhausen also got an interchange that could be used by the rising number of cars. The building of the Thei√ütalbr√ºcke (‚ÄúThei√ü Valley Bridge‚Äù), which was finished before the outbreak of the Second World War, employed up to 700 workers, who were housed in Niedernhausen and had to be supplied. After having been spared early on in the Second World War, things changed with the Allies‚Äô advance beginning in 1944. Owing to the community's importance as a railway junction and the resident F√ºhrer-Schule with its transmission facilities, the community was notably more heavily bombed than comparable places in the area. Between May 1944 and March 1945 there were at least eight air raids. In the heaviest, on 22 February 1945, the railway station building, a great deal of the trackage, roughly 30 parked locomotives and dozens of other pieces of rolling stock were destroyed. Struck by the air raid were not only the railway facilities, but also several dwelling buildings in Niedernhausen and K√∂nigshofen. In July 1944, a train coming from Eppstein was bombed; it is estimated that this resulted in 30 to 40 deaths. On the night of 25 to 26 August 1944, the Oberjosbach parish church burnt right down to the foundations after having been struck by an incendiary bomb. All together, roughly 200 people were killed in these air raids. Even today, many bomb craters are still to be found in the woods around Niedernhausen. In the air raids in August 1944, three US servicemen who had parachuted to earth were lynched by the populace upon landing. When the Americans came by way of Engenhahn and Niederseelbach to K√∂nigshofen and Niedernhausen, there was no resistance. The GIs‚Äô quick advance may well be what spared the Thei√ü Valley Bridge the customary demolition by retreating German forces. = Postwar era (1945‚Äì1975) = After the Second World War, as was so throughout West Germany, many refugees and Germans driven out of their lands in the former eastern territories and the Sudetenland came into the individual centres, above all Oberjosbach, Niedernhausen, K√∂nigshofen and Niederseelbach. Niederseelbach's population, for instance, thereby swelled by 1960 to twice what it had been in 1939. In the 1950s, consequently, the first new municipal developments arose. The rebuilt parish church in Oberjosbach had already opened in 1949. In Engenhahn, the Wildparkgel√§nde at first became an area for weekend houses. Beginning in 1975, it became an official and exclusive building area in which prominent persons such as Wim Thoelke, Ebby Thust and Susanne Fr√∂hlich live (or lived). In 1964, Oberseelbach took part for the first time in the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur Village Should Become Lovelier‚Äù), and in 1965 won the state victory for Hesse. When the Rhine-Main S-Bahn was being planned and it could be foreseen that Niedernhausen would be one of the termini, the community experienced a sharp rise in population. The big building development of Lenzhahner Weg then came into being. In the 1970s, four highrise blocks of flats were built along with a dozen other major blocks. The first S-Bahn train, running on line 2, reached Niedernhausen station on 25 August 1975. In 1970, the Oberseelbach bypass was opened, freeing the community's narrow main street of through traffic. = Boundary adjustments and municipal reform (1971 to present) = On 1 October 1971, the communities of Niedernhausen and K√∂nigshofen signed ‚Äì despite an age-old aversion towards each other ‚Äì a boundary adjustment agreement and merged into the community of Niedernhausen im Taunus, with K√∂nigshofen keeping its identity as an Ortsteil. In the course of municipal reform in Hesse, the community of Niedernhausen i. Ts was eventually formed on 1 January 1977 out of the hitherto self-governing communities of Niedernhausen with the Ortsteil of K√∂nigshofen, Engenhahn, Niederseelbach, Oberseelbach and Oberjosbach. At the same time, the community became part of the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis, founded on the same date, whose seat is at Bad Schwalbach. Formerly, Niedernhausen had belonged to the Main-Taunus-Kreis. Before this, there had been much earnest ‚Äúcourting‚Äù by Idstein and Niedernhausen of the communities in the Seelbacher Grund, giving rise to a third consideration that a self-governing community called Lenzenberg could be formed out of Engenhahn, Oberseelbach, Niederseelbach, Lenzhahn and Dasbach. In the end, though, Engenhahn, Oberseelbach and Niederseelbach chose to join Niedernhausen, while Lenzhahn and Dasbach, despite their centuries-long links with Oberseelbach and Niederseelbach, chose to join Idstein. In the early 1980s, the old school building and town hall in Niedernhausen was expanded into the greater community's town hall, and the Autalhalle was built. Beginning in 1985, a further great building area on the Sch√§fersberg, near Niedernhausen (main centre) was begun. Today, over half of the greater community's population lives in Niedernhausen. The second biggest constituent community is Oberjosbach with 2,150 inhabitants; the smallest is Oberseelbach with 450. The centres of Oberjosbach, Oberseelbach, Niederseelbach and Engenhahn have therefore largely been able to keep their village character. = Population development since the founding of the greater community in 1977 = Niedernhausen has undergone since the founding of the greater community on 1 January 1977 a great rise in population. The figure rose from 12,055 at the census in May 1987 to 14,722 in June 2003. This represents a rise of more than 22% (district average: roughly 11%). The causes are, more than anything else, the community's favourable location with regards to transport and its proximity to nature, as well as the Sch√§fersberg building development that was going on during this time. However, over the last few years, the population growth has been stagnating because there is now very little land left to develop in the Lenzhahner Weg and Sch√§fersberg development areas, and no new land is being opened up to development.

D√∂ring (SPD). He also became Niedernhausen's first directly elected mayor in 1995, later being re√´lected in both 2001 and 2007. The last direct mayoral election was held on 5 March 2007. With a voter turnout of 55%, the incumbent mayor D√∂ring, who was running for the last time, got 49.55% of the vote. His opponent Andreas Kn√ºttel (CDU) got 27.44%, and the independent candidate Isolde Ehrhart, a former CDU member and also former mayor Klaus Ehrhart's wife, got 23.01% of the vote. This resulted in a runoff between D√∂ring and Kn√ºttel, which was held on 25 March 2007, and from which D√∂ring emerged victorious with 59.6% of the vote. Andreas Kn√ºttel was left with 40.3% of the vote. Seat distribution on Niedernhausen council The community council (Gemeindevertretung), as Niedernhausen's highest political body, is elected every five years by all citizens who are eligible to vote. It has 37 seats. The last municipal election, held on 26 March 2006, yielded the following seat distribution: CDU: 15 seats, SPD: 10 seats, B√ºndnis 90/Die Gr√ºnen: 4 seats, FDP: 2 seats, W√§hlergemeinschaft Niedernhausen (WGN): 6 seats. The next municipal election will be held in 2011. The council chooses a community executive (Gemeindevorstand). This has nine members (CDU: 3 members, SPD: 2 members, B√ºndnis 90/Die Gr√ºnen: 2 members). Among the members are also the mayor and the first deputy (Gerd Paustian, WGN). The executive is supported by four boards which work on various issues, bringing them before the executive when a vote is needed. The four boards are the building board (Bauausschuss), the environmental board (Umweltausschuss), the social board (Sozialausschuss), and the main and financial board (Haupt- und Finanzausschuss). Each board has seven members (CDU: 3, SPD: 2, WGN: 1, Greens: 1). The main and outlying centres‚Äô concerns fall to the constituent community councils (Ortsbeir√§te). They have an advisory function on community council and are composed according to municipal election results in each centre. The political bodies sit at the community's town hall in the main centre of Niedernhausen. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" + Election results in Niedernhausen from 1997 to 2006 - style=\\"background:#b0c4de;\\" ! rowspan=\\"3\\"  Kind of election / Date ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Eligible voters ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Voter turnout ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Votes cast ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Share of valid votes - style=\\"background:#b0c4de;\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"  invalid ! valid !

Here, citizens can find the building office, the bylaw enforcement office, the licensing office, the register office, the local court and contact people for environmental, family, sanitation, and sundry other matters. Working at Town Hall are roughly 50 administrative employees. Furthermore, the community runs its own building yard. Here some 20 employees take care of winter services, street cleaning, graveyard, sporting ground, playground and greenspace maintenance, and also repair and maintenance of community-owned institutions and buildings. The waterworks and sewerage are kept running by the community works, which is attached to the building yard. Moreover, there is a recycling yard. At the six municipal kindergartens, about 35 kindergarten teachers are employed. Responsible for traffic and environmental infractions is the bylaw enforcement office. For all other security concerns, there is the police station in Idstein. There are longstanding demands, however, for a local police presence. =Coat of arms= left The community's arms might be described thus: Azure a lion rampant Or armed and langued gules among six billets of the second, in his forepaw sinister a sword argent held palewise. The arms were created in 1977. The lion is from the arms borne by the Duchy of Nassau. The silver sword in the lion's left forepaw refers to Oberjosbach's Electoral Mainz past; this outlying centre's coat of arms shows a sword in Mainz's heraldic tinctures, and the sword is also one of the Archangel Michael's attributes, thus symbolizing Oberjosbach's patron saint. The billets (small rectangles) stand for the community's six centres. =Municipal partnerships= * Wilrijk (constituent community of Antwerp, Belgium) The partnership has existed since 1980, when this was still a self-governing town (about 38,000 inhabitants). Since then, there has been a regular exchange, with cycling tours between the two places being arranged. Since 1984, Wilrijk has been a constituent community of Antwerp, which has changed nothing about the intensive relationship. The square before Niedernhausen's town hall was named after Wilrijk, making the community administration's address Wilrijkplatz (no house number). * Ilfeld (Harz, Thuringia) The connection with the Thuringian town in the Harz (3,000 inhabitants) was spurred shortly after German reunification in 1990, likely also in the east to get some structural subsidies. The partnership between Ilfeld and Wilrijk, forged by Niedernhausen's initiative, has created a three-way partnership. The square before Niedernhausen's railway station has since its remodelling been known as Ilfelder Platz. Rhein-Main- Theater in Niedernhausen Economy and infrastructure =Economy= Niedernhausen is generally said to be a bedroom town for the cities in Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. At 30%, Wiesbaden has the greatest share of commuters from Niedernhausen, followed closely by Frankfurt am Main. The number of jobs has risen along with the population, although given the local commuting structure, the share of the population employed locally has always been rather slight, at about 10%. In June 1987, 1,192 persons were employed in Niedernhausen. By June 2002 this had risen by about 21% to 1,443. The share engaged in service businesses in 1987 was about 65%, and in 2002, 71%. The local purchasing power is about ‚Ç¨21,346 for each inhabitant, putting it roughly 28.5% above the national average, and thereby also making it the highest figure for the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis. Niedernhausen is home to mostly small and midsize businesses, overwhelmingly in the service provision sector. Meanwhile, there are more than 30 high-technology firms, among them about 20 in information technology, as well as seven companies in measuring and control technology. The community's biggest employer, with 220 on staff, is Hartmann Druckfarben GmbH in Niederseelbach (printing inks) which has been an established business here since 1968. Another big employer, the RAMADA Hotel Micador, is a conference and convention hotel with 254 rooms and the adjoining Rhein-Main-Theater, which was built between 1993 and 1995 specially to present Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äôs musical Sunset Boulevard. Beginning in 1976 in the Sch√∂ne Aussicht, the biggest publishing house for German guidebooks, the FALKEN-Verlagsgruppe was resident. With 120 employees and roughly 1,200 available books, it generated a turnover of roughly ‚Ç¨45,000,000. In 2000, however, the publishing house was taken over by the Bertelsmann concern and closed. All together there are four industrial areas, a small one in each of K√∂nigshofen, Oberseelbach and Niederseelbach as well as a somewhat bigger one in Niedernhausen near the Autobahn interchange. Here it is planned to open up a further 5 ha or so of land to mixed and commercial development. Niedernhausen station, a railway junction on the Main-Lahn-Bahn =Transport= Niedernhausen station lies on the Main-Lahn Railway running from Frankfurt am Main to Limburg an der Lahn. The line was opened early on, in 1877, and the station is the main junction on this line between Frankfurt- H√∂chst and Eschhofen, as it is here that the L√§ndchesbahn branches off, running to the main railway station in Hesse's state capital, Wiesbaden. Given its importance as such, Niedernhausen station was targeted by Allied bombers several times in the Second World War. Since 1975, Niedernhausen has also been the outermost stop on the Rhine-Main S-Bahn‚Äôs line S2, which links the community with Frankfurt‚Äôs main station with a travel time of roughly 35 minutes. Furthermore, the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line, with its Niedernhausener Tunnel runs through the municipal area. Besides the train connections to Frankfurt am Main, Wiesbaden and Limburg an der Lahn, there is also a city bus connection to Wiesbaden (route 22 of the ESWE ‚Äì Wiesbaden‚Äôs transport system) linking the centres of Oberjosbach, Niedernhausen and K√∂nigshofen to the state capital with a travel time of roughly 30 minutes. There is also a local bus service linking all outlying centres to the main centre and the railway station. Long-distance buses likewise call at Niedernhausen railway station. There are no pedestrian precincts in Niedernhausen. Nevertheless, the main shopping street, Bahnhofsstra√üe (‚ÄúRailway Station Street‚Äù) is a traffic-free one-way street which is completely blocked to motorized traffic for various events (wine festival, Christmas market, and so on). In the Taunus woods around the community is a tight web of signposted hiking trails. There is a ‚ÄúPark&Ride;‚Äù facility available at Niedernhausen S-Bahn station. Likewise, a great number of parking spaces is on hand at the Niedernhausen forest swimming pool and the Rhein- Main-Theater. There are parking spaces in the main centre, too. Niedernhausen has an interchange on the A 3 (Cologne‚ÄìFrankfurt) lying roughly 2 km south of the main centre. Past the interchange and through the municipal area runs Bundesstra√üe 455. Frankfurt Airport can be reached by Autobahn in about 20 minutes. By train ‚Äì with a transfer at the main station in either Frankfurt or Wiesbaden ‚Äì it takes roughly an hour. Given this easy access to the airport, Niedernhausen has also become a favourite choice among airport employees as a home. Infrastructure Thei√ütalschule, a co√∂perative comprehensive school in Niedernhausen (main centre) =Schools= In Niedernhausen there are two public schools. The Thei√ütalschule in the main centre was expanded in the late 1990s from a primary school with orientation level (F√∂rderstufe) into a cooperative comprehensive school with primary level and also Hauptschule, Realschule and Gymnasium branches. The Lenzenbergschule in the outlying centre of Niederseelbach is a so-called Mittelpunkts-Grundschule (‚Äúmidpoint primary school‚Äù, a central school, designed to eliminate smaller outlying schools) for the outlying centres of Engenhahn, Niederseelbach and Oberseelbach. In the outlying centre of K√∂nigshofen are also found a private Gymnasium and a music school. =Churches= Within community limits are three Catholic parishes, two Evangelical and one New Apostolic. The Catholic ones are Maria K√∂nigin in Niedernhausen, St. Michael in Oberjosbach and St. Martha in Engenhahn. The two Evangelical parishes are Christuskirche in Niedernhausen and another in Niederseelbach with Niedernhausen's oldest church, the Johanneskirche from the 15th century. The old Catholic church in Niedernhausen is nowadays used as a cultural centre. =Sport and leisure facilities= In Niedernhausen there are several football pitches, among them two paved ones in Engenhahn and Niederseelbach as well as an artificial-turf pitch in Niedernhausen. Besides those, there are three smaller sporting grounds in Niedernhausen, K√∂nigshofen and Oberjosbach as well as an athletics facility attached to the Thei√ütalschule. The great three-field sporting hall, the Autalhalle is used not only by local clubs, but also for trade fairs and sundry other events. The schools and the bigger sport clubs each have their own halls. Furthermore, there are a tennis club that plays on several courts and in a hall, a riding ring, several skittle alleys and the Waldschwimmbad (‚Äúforest swimming pool‚Äù) with several basins, slides and a diving tower. Right next to the pool, a rollerskating rink was opened in July 2006. The local Thei√ütal recreation area offers, besides several barbecue areas, a great angling pond. In the centre of Engenhahn, in severe winters, cross-country skiing trails are laid out. =Kindergartens, daycare, after-school care and community centers = All together six municipally owned kindergartens are to be found in the centres of Niedernhausen (Ahornstra√üe and Sch√§fersberg), K√∂nigshofen, Niederseelbach, Oberjosbach and Engenhahn. Moreover, the Catholic Church runs the St. Josef kindergarten. A private parents‚Äô association runs a rhythmic-musical kindergarten called TASIMU with daycare and after-school care. Besides the great three-field sporting hall with caterer's (Autalhalle), community buildings are to be found in every other centre for events. Furthermore, next to the town hall carpark is a revamped old slaughterhouse that now serves as a youth centre. Youngsters can play billiards or table football, or simply ‚Äúchill‚Äù and have a drink, or listen to bands that appear on the small stage. Culture and sightseeing Sign at Wilrijk-Platz before Niedernhausen's town hall =Rhein-Main-Theater= The nationally known Rhein-Main-Theater, right on the Niedernhausen Autobahn interchange, is used for many international events. The house, with 1,566 seats shared between the stalls and two galleries, was built between 1993 and 1995 at a cost of ‚Ç¨25,000,000 specially to present the first German-language production of Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äôs musical Sunset Boulevard. The play ran from December 1995 to August 1998, with the leads being played by the well known musical stars Uwe Kr√∂ger und Helen Schneider, and later also the actress Daniela Ziegler. Nevertheless, the star- studded cast could not stave off insolvency. Today, changing events take place at the theatre. The halt on the L√§ndchesbahn (railway), built specially for the theatre, was opened in 1996 and after the theatre was for the time being closed in 1998, the halt, too, was closed. =Other event venues and institutions= Besides the Rhein-Main-Theater there is also a whole series of further event venues in Niedernhausen. Particularly worthy of note are the Zentrum Alte Kirche (ZAK) and the youth club I4. The Old Catholic Church on Wiesbadener Stra√üe was threatening to fall into disrepair after the Catholic parish shifted their house of worship to the new church on Bahnhofstra√üe. In 1980, a private club took over the leasehold for 99 years, had the building put under monumental protection and renovated it on its own initiative. Today, the house offers an unusual and appealing setting for a great number of events from readings to concerts and theatrical productions to art exhibitions. Zentrum Alte Kirche in Niedernhausen: formerly a Catholic church, today a cultural centre Youths first organized themselves in the late 1980s with the community's encouragement and support. Their first home was in a room in the Autalhalle, before the community acquired a shabby building across from the Town Hall in 1992. The youths made out of their Wiesbadener Stra√üe 2 ‚Äì W2 for short ‚Äì a thriving place with many of their own initiatives. In the end, when the building was at last going to be torn down, they got ready to move. The former butcher's shop with adjoining slaughterhouse they converted as a volunteer project into a concert and event venue. Taking place at I4 (for Idsteiner Stra√üe 4) today, besides the regular operations and several working groups are also rock concerts and parties. Not only does The Autalhalle serve the Thei√ütalschule and local clubs as a sport hall, but also it offers, with its wheel-away grandstand, the adjoining caterer's and its configuration, which allows flexibility, a space for regular fairs, exhibitions and sundry other events. The Free Democratic Party and the Greens, for instance, have held their Hesse party conferences here in past years. Likewise, the community council sits here. At one time, the hall was even used as the ‚Äúfestival tent‚Äù at the Niedernhausen Kerb. =Clubs= In Niedernhausen there is a lively club life with a remarkable number of clubs ‚Äì roughly 100 ‚Äì and thousands of members. Many volunteer helpers make this possible. Most clubs give themselves over to sport. The most successful of these is SV Niedernhausen, which is almost purely a football club. Since advancing in 2006, the club has quickly established itself in the Gruppenliga Wiesbaden and is even in line for further promotion to the next highest league. The best known player is Christopher Ihm, who lives in Niedernhausen and is a former professional of 1.FSV Mainz 05. At Sportverein Niederseelbach 1951, it is mainly football that is played. The two clubs each have up to 18 teams in the various age groups from ‚ÄúG-Jugend‚Äù (those no older than 7) to the seniors‚Äô team. Niederseelbach played for a time in the Bezirksoberliga Wiesbaden, and now currently plays in the \\"A-Klasse Rheingau-Taunus\\". The volleyball division of SV Niederseelbach has existed since 1981. SV Niederseelbach also offers an informal walking programme and Nordic walking. Turngemeinde 1896 Niedernhausen, with roughly 1,000 active members the community's biggest club, Turn- und Sportverein K√∂nigshofen 1898, Turn- und Sportverein Engenhahn 1977 and Turngemeinde 1899 Oberjosbach all offer leisure sports. The two first ones each have an athletics and gymnastics division, both of which regularly take part in competitions, among them the Deutsches Turnfest and the Hesse State Gymnastics Festivals. All four clubs each have their own clubhouse and training ground. TG Niedernhausen also runs a big basketball division, which sometimes boasts as many as 10 teams. The first men's and the first women's teams each play in district class A. Tennis-Club Niedernhausen, with about 400 members, plays on 9 outdoor courts (sand) and three indoor. At the tennis hall, moreover, are several squash courts. Worthy of notice are the Aikido-Club with roughly 130 members, which commits itself to Japanese self-defence arts, and the local DLRG chapter with roughly 260 members, who use the forest pool for their swimming sport. In the winter, this is done in indoor pools in Wiesbaden. Likewise worth mentioning is the Intressengemeinschaft Reiten und Fahren e.V., Niedernhausen/Ts. (IRFN, riding club). The riding facilities, Am Hahnwald, which belong to the club have at their disposal, besides stabling, a dressage square, a show jumping square and a riding hall. High in membership are also Ski-Club Niedernhausen with about 600, Kerbegesellschaft Veilchenblau Oberjosbach and Kerbeborsch K√∂nigshofen (both kermis clubs) with about 130 members. Furthermore, there are Kerbeverein Niederseelbach (another kermis club), Sch√§fersbergteam, which stages various events in the Sch√§fersberg new building area, among them the Sch√§fersbergfest, as well as Frohsinn 1875 Engenhahn (men's singing), 1873 Niedernhausen, Eintracht 1885 Niederseelbach and fire brigade clubs in individual centres. In the smallest centre, the Heimat und Kulturverein Oberseelbach looks after, for instance, keeping up the baking tradition, the cultural community and maintaining the scenic heritage. The Sch√ºtzenverein K√∂nigshofen 1959 e.V. with about 200 members can boast its own indoor shooting range with 10 √ó10 m airgun enclosures and 10 √ó25 m and 6 √ó50 m stalls. The Vocal-Ensemble Le Courage e.V. is a women's choir of national importance. It was founded in 1977 by music director Wolfgang Diefenbach and has been led by him ever since. The choir currently has roughly 55 active singers aged between 14 and 75. They have made a number of recordings, and the ensemble has won 36 victories in regional and international choral contests and come in first at the Hesse Choral Competition. =Regular events= What follows is a selection of regular events in Niedernhausen: * Gickellauf Engenhahn (established forest run and family festival, third Sunday in September) * Sch√§fersbergfest (Sch√§fersberg neighbourhood) * Gemeindeschie√üen (‚ÄúCommunity Shooting‚Äù, K√∂nigshofen Shooting Club, mid-November) * Weinfest Niedernhausen (wine festival, Bahnhofstra√üe) * Zeltkerb K√∂nigshofen (‚Äútent kermis‚Äù, K√∂nigshofen fairground, third weekend in August) * Oberjosbacher Kerb (kermis, Oberjosbach community centre) * Niederseelbacher Kerb (kermis, Niederseelbach, mid-October) * TuFuMaBa (Fastnacht masquerade ball in Niederseelbach, Lenzenberghalle) * Sportwoche Niederseelbach (‚Äúsport week‚Äù, Niederseelbach sporting ground, late July) * Sport-Spiel-Spa√ü Oberjosbach (‚Äúsport-play-fun‚Äù, Jahnhalle, early September) * Weihnachtsmarkt Niedernhausen (Christmas market, Bahnhofstra√üe, first weekend in Advent) * Ausstellung Form-Bild-Farbe (‚ÄúShape-Image-Colour Exhibition‚Äù, Autalhalle) * Orchideenschau (‚ÄúOrchid Show‚Äù, Autalhalle) * Gewerbeausstellung (business fair, Autalhalle) * SV Niedernhausen's matches on the artificial- turf pitch at the Autalarena * Sportfest Niederseelbach (Niederseelbach sporting ground, September) * Great Dressage and Show Jumping tournament (Niedernhausen riding square) =Thei√ü Valley Bridge= The community's landmark is the Thei√ütalbr√ºcke (‚ÄúThei√ü Valley Bridge‚Äù), part of the A 3, which spans the narrow Thei√ü Valley on 16 arches stretching across 500 m with a maximum height of 46 m. Parallel to it in the 1990s arose another bridge that carries the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line, whose dimensions are roughly the same as the older bridge's. The arch motif is used by the community's administration and a few clubs as a symbol. =Buildings=  Johanneskirche (Evangelical church)  Johanneskirche (‚ÄúSaint John‚Äôs Church‚Äù), an Evangelical church in Niederseelbach with 200-year-old limetree The Johanneskirche in Niederseelbach was from the Middle Ages the Seelbacher Grund‚Äôs religious and spiritual hub. It is the most valuable historic building in the greater community of Niedernhausen. When the church was built is unknown, although there must have been a forerunner building at the time when the parish was founded about 1220 by the Counts of Nassau. The church's somewhat off-centre location in relation to the Niederseelbach village core is a clue that the church might have begun as a rural church (Feldkirche), as was customary in Carolingian times about 800. The church is a plain building with a flat-ceilinged single nave and a quire. Adjoining it on the north side is the tower, which has an underground vault. A few jutting corbels on the walls and in the quire are all that is left of the former Gothic vaulting, which itself might put the nave's building date in the 15th century. The tower acquired its Welsche Haube (the particular kind of cupola seen here) in 1790. Catholic churches The church St. Michael in Oberjosbach goes back to the founding of the parish of Oberjosbach in 1196. The church has, however, been destroyed several times, having been built anew in 1321, 1728 and most recently in 1949. The church St. Martha in Engenhahn was built in 1890 and 1891 in the Gothic Revival style after the Catholic inhabitants split from the parish of Oberjosbach in 1888 and were assigned to the parish of Idstein. The old Catholic church in Niedernhausen was consecrated in 1885, after the growing community's Catholics made it known that they did not want to make the long trip to Oberjosbach anymore. After the so-called Kapellenstreit (‚ÄúChapel dispute‚Äù) over what K√∂nigshofen's share towards the church should be, the community of Mari√§ Geburt was finally founded on 1 October 1904, which the Bishop of Limburg an der Lahn raised to parish on 1 May 1921. Since the new church was built on Bahnhofstra√üe in 1960, the old church has been used as a cultural centre, and the parish has called itself Maria K√∂nigin. Old town hall in Engenhahn from 1768 Historical town halls and school buildings Historical town halls are to be found in the centres of Oberjosbach und Engenhahn. The Engenhahn town hall was built in 1768, served beginning in 1820 as a school and later housed the community administration until 1977. The building is a timber-frame house under monumental protection, as is the old bakehouse (Backes) in Oberseelbach. The town hall in Niedernhausen, which today serves as the community's administrative seat, was originally a school building built in 1903, in which the mayor's office was also housed. In 1981, it was expanded into a representative building and is today a further community landmark. Other secular buildings The old Gasthaus zum Anker right near the town hall, built towards the end of the 17th century, had an eventful history behind it. From 1734, it was an inn. It was under monumental protection, but it was threatening to fall asunder, and was in the end torn down on 23 February 2008. In K√∂nigshofen the old locomotive shed and an old watertower bear witness to Niedernhausen's time as a railway stronghold. Also worth seeing are the Gr√ºnderzeit villas on the Sch√∂ne Aussicht, which still give one an impression of Niedernhausen's time as an open-air resort. =Nature= The Rhein-Taunus Nature Park, much of which is wooded, lies within community limits and abuts residential areas in places. Of particular scenic charm is the ridge running between a line between Niederseelbach and Engenhahn and the local recreation and conservation area of the Thei√ü valley running parallel thereto. The highest elevation is the Hohe Kanzel at 592 m above sea level. From west to east, a dale runs through the municipal area, over whose slopes Niedernhausen's residential neighbourhoods stretch. In Oberjosbach is found a 500-year-old oak. North of Niedernhausen, on the Eselskopf, are a few bizarre crag formations in the middle of the forest (Hohler Stein ‚Äì ‚ÄúHollow Stone‚Äù).

Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down both a state statute denying funding for education to undocumented immigrant children in the United States and a municipal school district's attempt to charge an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each student to compensate for lost state funding. The Court found that any state restriction imposed on the rights afforded to children based on their immigration status must be examined under an rational-basis standard to determine whether it furthers a \\"substantial\\" government interest. The application of Plyler v. Doe has been limited to K-12 schooling. Other court cases and legislation such as Toll v. Moreno and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 have allowed some states to pass statutes that deny undocumented immigrant students eligibility for in- state tuition, scholarships, or enrollment at public colleges and universities. Summary Revisions to education laws in Texas in 1975 withheld state funds for educating children who had not been legally admitted to the United States and authorized local school districts to deny enrollment to such students. A 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court found the policy to violate the Fourteenth Amendment, as undocumented immigrant children are people \\"in any ordinary sense of the term\\" and therefore had protection from discrimination unless a substantial state interest could be shown to justify it. The court majority found that the Texas law was \\"directed against children, and impose[d] its discriminatory burden on the basis of a legal characteristic over which children can have little control\\", the fact that they had been brought illegally into the United States by their parents. The majority also observed that denying the children in question a proper education would likely contribute to \\"the creation and perpetuation of a subclass of illiterates within our boundaries, surely adding to the problems and costs of unemployment, welfare, and crime\\". The majority refused to accept that any substantial state interest would be served by discrimination on that basis and so struck down the Texas law. Texas officials had argued that undocumented immigrants were not \\"within the jurisdiction\\" of the state and thus could not claim protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court majority rejected that claim but found that \\"no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment 'jurisdiction' can be drawn between resident immigrants whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident immigrants whose entry was unlawful.\\" The dissenting opinion also rejected that claim and agreeed with the Court that \\"the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to immigrants who, after their illegal entry into this country, are indeed physically 'within the jurisdiction' of a state.\\" The dissent simply concluded that the distinction the statute drew should survive an equal protection attack. =Dissent= The dissent agreed in principle that it was unwise for undocumented immigrant children to be denied a public education, but the four dissenting justices argued that the Texas law was not so objectionable as to be unconstitutional; that the issue ought to be dealt with through the legislative process; that \\"[t]he Constitution does not provide a cure for every social ill, nor does it vest judges with a mandate to try to remedy every social problem;\\" and that the majority was overstepping its bounds by seeking \\"to do Congress' job for it, compensating for congressional inaction\\". This case was decided together with Texas v. Certain Named and Unnamed Alien Children.

Originally it was a jat village of Rathi, Tokas & Dahiya Gotra. Munirka villager's land was squired by the government. Its neighborhood consists of JNU campus on the south, Vasant vihar on North-West, RK Puram on the northern side and IIT campus and Ber sarai on south-eastern front. The Outer ring road forms the north to the east boundary of this and also making it accessible. This is near flyover. The notification for the urbanisation of Munirka was issued in March 1954, making it one of the earliest villages to be urbanised. The nearest metro station is Munirka. Migrants and population Munirka has always been home to a large number of migrants. It has a very high population density for a small area. This derives from Munirka's proximity to Jawaharlal Nehru University, Rama Krishna Puram, Vasant Vihar Indian Institute of Technology and its location on the Outer Ring Road, which makes easy transport to and from many business centres of Delhi. One can find people from every single province in India here, and eateries and restaurants catering to their palette as well. There is a Korean church, a Sikh gurdwara, and a mosque other than the Baba Ganganath temple, which houses the patron deity of the village. Architecture Munda Gumbad, an incomplete tomb from Lodhi dynasty periodIt is a very old village‚Äîcomplete with a smattering of Lodi-era monuments‚Äînow absorbed by the relentless expansion of Delhi, which has both changed and threatened the very culture of the pre-urban communities of the Delhi region - Bramhin and Jat. There is a baoli (step well), a Lodi structure and a small Saiyid (a small mazaar-like shrine) of Sufi Saint called Ajirpur preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India in the park across the Outer Ring Road in RK Puram Sector-5. Elder residents of Munirka can still be found to offer a jot (incense on a stick; Hindi jyot), testifying to the syncretic cultural history of the region. This part of the village has given to the DDA sports complex, Vasant Kunj, Jawahar Lal University and the DTC Bus Depot. Further to the west Basant Lok and Vasant Vihar have been built on agrarian land which was acquired by the Delhi government from Munirka and Basant villages. To the north R.K. Puram has also been built on such land. One can see the Qutub Minar from parts of Munirka. It is also on the path of planes landing at the Delhi International Airport.

In 1978, while a medical student, he founded the IT startup Medicom, selling medical software solutions in the UK and the Middle East, based on early personal computers. After qualifying as a physician he cared for people dying of cancer at St Joseph's Hospice and then as part of the Community Care Team based at University College Hospital, London, while also continuing IT consulting part-time. In 1988 he launched the AIDS charity ACET, following publication of his first book The Truth about AIDS, which warned of an unfolding catastrophe that has since hit many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. ACET grew rapidly, providing home care services across London and other parts of the UK, as well as a national sex education programme in schools, reaching more than 450,000 students. Dixon no longer practices as a physician, but remains actively involved as Chairman of the ACET International Alliance. This is now a network of independent national AIDS care and prevention programmes, sharing the same name and values, active in 23 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia.

Futurewise, first published in 1998, uses the word FUTURE as a mnemonic standing for \\"Six Faces of the Future\\" which will impact every large business: Fast, Urban, Tribal, Universal, Radical and Ethical. Dixon is optimistic about the capacity of human innovation to solve complex challenges: > This millennium will witness the greatest challenges to human survival that > we have ever seen, and many of them will face us in the early years of the > first century. It will also provide us with science and technology beyond > our greatest imaginings, and the greatest shift in values for over 50 years. > Futurewise, page xi Building a Better Business, published in 2005, describes a new approach to leadership, management, marketing, teams, brands, customer relations, innovation, strategy, corporate governance and values. The book applies lessons from volunteering and non-profit organisations in motivating and inspiring large numbers of people to achieve great things. In it, Dixon argues that all successful leadership derives from an appeal to a common desire for a better future‚Äîfor customers, workers, shareholders and communities. He attacks the \\"dangerous\\" obsession with shareholder value in many global corporations: Sustainagility, published in 2010 and co-authored by Johan Gorecki, describes green technology and innovations across a wide range of industries, which Dixon believes will help to transform and protect the world.

The construction of the lighthouse came out of the tragedy of losing a small Spanish coaster called the Juan Ferrer on 23 October 1963, on the nearby Boscawen Point, the vessel capsized with the loss of 11 lives. After the tragedy the Newlyn and Mousehole Fishermen's Association put pressure on Trinity House for a lighthouse to be built, stating that similar tragedies could happen again. History Designed by Michael H. Crisp, the lighthouse was constructed with a completely automatic installation which is remotely controlled from the Trinity House depot in Penzance. The lighthouse, built with concrete blocks, was completed by July 1965. The short building houses a 7-foot 1 inch lantern with an electric light which is powered from batteries which are charged from mains electricity during the day. The light is 3 white lights flashed every 15 seconds, with a range of 23 miles. There is a separate red fixed light that shows in the line over the Runnelstone Rock. The fog signal was originally a series (72 in total) of Tannoy units built into the lighthouse tower. This was replaced by a short-range Pharos Marine Omnidirectional electric emitter sounding the same characteristic of two one second blasts every 30 seconds during fog. The fog signal was decommissioned in 2012. This lighthouse looks out over the Inner and Outer Bucks, two rocks that partially show at low water, and where in 1868 the SS Garonne was lost. They form a popular sub-aqua dive site. The nearest point for launching a dive-boat is Penzance, as Lamorna Cove just around the corner from The Bucks, does not allow launching from there. The coastal slope and cliffs around the lighthouse are designated the Tater‚Äìdu SSSI (a Site of Special Scientific Interest) notified in 1992 because ‚Ä≥... it provides unique evidence of the geological history of SW England during the Variscan orogeny, in particular because of the occurrence of pillow lavas.‚Ä≥ The cliffs are also a Geological Conservation Review site.

It lies within the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and it is featured in the Nature Conservation Review. A small part is managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust, and access to this area requires a permit. Site Description The wood consists of an extensive tract of the Chiltern escarpment. It contains beech woodlands, scrub and chalk grassland. It is one of three extant British locations for the red helleborine orchid.Species distribution map for Cephalanthera rubra, NBN Gateway, retrieved 25 February 2010Ratcliffe, D. A. (1977) A Nature Conservation Review Volume 2. Site Accounts p. 53 The beech woodlands incorporate communities characteristic of soils on the Clay-with-flints of the Chiltern plateau and the chalky deposits of the scarp slopes. Associated with the beech on the plateau are oak and occasional birch whilst on the slopes, the associated species are ash and whitebeam. Both even-aged and more mixed stands are represented, the latter typically with a shrub layer including gorse and honeysuckle on the plateau, and elder and hazel on the slopes. On the plateau, brambles, bracken and rosebay willowherb occupy extensive patches, but a more mixed ground flora occurs between these, including creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), hairy brome (Bromus ramosus), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), wood millet (Milium effusum) and wood melick (Melica uniflora). Pill sedge (Carex pilulifera), hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa) and slender St. John's-wort (Hypericum pulchrum) are found in more heathy areas, and the rushes Juncus effusus and J. conglomeratus are present in damper areas. On the slopes dog's-mercury (Mercurialis perennis) and woodruff (Galium odoratum) are abundant, while more local species include nettle-leaved bellflower (Campanula trachelium), white (Cephalanthera damasonium), broad-leaved (Epipactis helleborine) and narrow-lipped (E. leptochila)helleborines, yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys) and scaly male-fern (Dryopteris affinis). Juniper scrub occurs on Windsor Hill itself, where it is associated with various other typical chalk shrubs and chalk grassland with an abundance of the moss Pseudoscleropodium purum and common valerian (Valeriana officinalis). There are patches of bare chalk with forget-me-nots (Myosotis species) and common mullein (Verbascum thapsus). On Kop Hill, hawthorn dominates the scrub, and the grassland is less mossy. Several localised plant species such as squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica) chalk eyebright (Euphrasia pseudokerneri), horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), autumn gentian (Gentianella amarella) and clustered bellflower (Campanula glomerata) occur. A further small area of chalk grassland dominated by wood false-brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum) and glaucous sedge (Carex flacca) occurs at the foot of Pink Hill. 23 species of butterflies have been recorded, including brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), which requires scrub thickets and woodland edge habitats. The juniper colony supports several species of insects specific to this host plant. The snail fauna includes Abida secale, Helicella itala and Pomatias elegans. There is access from Kop Hill Road and Peters Lane.

The opposite condition is hypovolemia, which is too little fluid volume in the blood. Fluid volume excess in the intravascular compartment occurs due to an increase in total body sodium content and a consequent increase in extracellular body water. The mechanism usually stems from compromised regulatory mechanisms for sodium handling as seen in congestive heart failure (CHF), kidney failure, and liver failure. It may also be caused by excessive intake of sodium from foods, intravenous (IV) solutions and blood transfusions, medications, or diagnostic contrast dyes. Treatment typically includes administration of diuretics and limit the intake of water, fluids, sodium, and salt. Signs and symptoms The excess fluid, primarily salt and water, builds up in various locations in the body and leads to an increase in weight, swelling in the legs and arms (peripheral edema), and/or fluid in the abdomen (ascites). Eventually, the fluid enters the air spaces in the lungs (pulmonary edema) reduces the amount of oxygen that can enter the blood, and causes shortness of breath (dyspnea) or enters pleural space by transudation (pleural effusion which also causes dyspnea), which is the best indicator of estimating central venous pressure is increased. It can also cause swelling of the face. Fluid can also collect in the lungs when lying down at night, possibly making nighttime breathing and sleeping difficult (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea). =Complications= Congestive heart failure is the most common result of fluid overload.

He is known to be one of the most influential Kurdish writers and poets in the Kurdistan region of the Middle East, and his work has been renewed for the creation of hundreds of songs and played a crucial role in the preservation of Kurdish cultural heritage. Biography Cigerxw√Æn's real name was Sheikhmous Hasan. His pen name, Cigerxw√Æn, means \\"bleeding liver\\" in the Kurdish language. He was born to a Yazidi mother in the Kurdish village of Hesar close to the city of Batman, Turkey, within the then-Ottoman Empire, now in southeastern Turkey. The year of his birth is known, but no documentation exists to indicate the day and month. In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, his family became refugees and fled to Amude near the city of Qamishli in present-day north-eastern Syria. Cigerxw√Æn studied theology and became a cleric in 1921. He and his compatriots established a Kurdish association in Amude. In 1946 he moved to Qamishli and became involved in politics. In the same year, he became the secretary of \\"Civata Azad√Æ √ª Yek√Ætiya Kurd\\" (Kurdish Freedom and Union Front). In 1948 he joined the Communist Party of Syria and became the Party's candidate for the Syrian Parliament in 1954. He left the Communist Party in 1957 to create the \\"Azad√Æ\\" (Freedom) organization. After a period of time, this new party was united with the Kurdish Democratic Party of Syria. Cigerxw√Æn was arrested and jailed in Damascus in 1963 and was eventually exiled to the city of Suwayda. In 1969 he moved to Iraqi Kurdistan, where he became involved in the Kurdish uprising led by Mustafa Barzani. In 1973 he went to Lebanon where he published his widely publicized poetry collection K√Æme Ez? (Who Am I?). In 1976, he returned to Syria, but three years later, at the age of 75 or 76, he again fled to Sweden. He was able to publish several collections of poetry in Sweden. Cigerxw√Æn died in Stockholm at the age of 80 or 81. His body was returned to Kurdistan and buried at his house in Qamishli. Works Cigerxw√Æn began writing poetry in 1924. After the collapse of Sheikh Said's rebellion, he became a member of \\"Xoyb√ªn\\" (Independence) party, which was established by the exiled Kurdish intellectuals in Syria. Following the Sheikh Said rebellion he started contributing to the Kurdish journal Hawar by publishing poems. His poetry expresses the ideas of modern romanticism and realism while maintaining the classical form of traditional Kurdish poetry. In his poems, he sharply criticizes the backward feudal and religious establishments which were considered as the main reason for the Kurdish workers' and peasants' miserable living conditions. He also maintained that these backward forces are the main obstacle to ultimate Kurdish freedom and independence. In 1961, he created a new Kurdish language department, focused on Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji), at the University of Baghdad. During the same period, he was working in the Kurdish section of Radio Baghdad. Cigerxw√Æn (Jigarkhwin) wrote in the Kurmanji dialect and his poetry has had such an enormous influence on the Kurdish people and culture throughout the Kurdistan region in the Middle East, that the time period during his writing is often called the Jigerkhwin-period in Kurdish poetry. He took good care of the old heritage from classical Kurdish poets like Jaziri and Ahmad Khani. His poetry is simple and revolutionary with a strong popular appeal often at the expense of the aesthetic. He published eight collections of his poems, a book on Kurdistan's history, a Kurdish language dictionary and a book on Kurdish folklore.

It was founded as Varese Football Club on 22 March 1910. It became Associazione Sportiva Varesina in 1923, Varese Sportiva in 1926, reverted to Varese F.C. from 1946 to 2004, and then Associazione Sportiva Varese 1910 (A.S. Varese 1910) from 2004 to 2015. The club dissolved in 2019. History The club was formed on March 22, 1910, as Varese Football Club, with the goal of promoting football and other open air games. All members, both players and management, paid dues of 1 Lira every month. The club's colours were white and purple and the local market place doubled as the club's first ground. A rope fenced off the pitch from the public, and dressing rooms were improvised in an alley restaurant. The club played numerous friendly matches before joining any sort of league or organised competition. Early opponents included the \\"Aurora\\" of Busto Arsizio, the \\"Libertas\\" of Gallarate, the Luino, the Unione Sportiva Milanese, the Ausonia, and Inter. The club took the first steps on the Italian league ladder by entering the Lega Regionale Lombarda in 1914, and the first official championship saw the Varesini playing in their original colours of purple and white silk. The club's American goalkeeper, Sormani, distinguished himself in this first official season as one of Varese's star players. In May 1915 the war interrupted the season, but by 1919, World War I had ended and life returned to its regular rhythm with a resurgence of interest in football and other recreational activities. 1972‚Äì73 Varese with a young Claudio Gentile (standing, second from right) In 1926‚Äì27, the club's colours became white and red (\\"bianco-rosso\\"), to match the colours of the city. In the quarter of Masnago, a stadium named Stadio del Littorio was constructed. It was renamed in September 1950 to Stadio Franco Ossola, in honour of a player who had transferred from Varese to Torino Calcio and died in the 1949 Superga air disaster. Varese, a town not far from Milan, is highly regarded by various athletes who dress \\"bianco-rosso\\" (white-red) thanks to Military Territorial Compartments (between the most known players Giuseppe Meazza). In 1964, with the entrepreneur Giovanni Borghi as president, the Varese achieved a place in Serie A after two consecutive promotions from the Serie C. Among the notable players who have worn the white and red shirt are Pietro Anastasi, Roberto Bettega, and the World Cup winners Claudio Gentile, Giampiero Marini and Riccardo Sogliano. After a decade in the top-flight, the golden era of Varese ended with relegation in 1975. From 1975 to 1985 the club played in Second Division Serie B but one year in Third one, during season 1979‚Äì80. Relegated the previous season the club regained immediately its place in Serie B. Since further relegation in 1985, the club had not succeeded in returning to Serie B: 10 of the next 20 seasons were spent in C2, where the club were readmitted after promotion from Campionato Nazionale Dilettanti in 1994. The club returned to the C1 Series within four years thanks to the work of general manager Stefano Capozucca, brought to Varese by the entrepreneur Claudio Milanese, who was then co-owner of the club with the President, Paolo Binda, and other lesser associates. In 2001, after financial conflicts between entrepreneur Gianvittorio Gandolfi and sponsors SiViaggi and CIT, the Turri family arrived at the club, bringing a series of innovations. In the summer of 2004, under the Turri-Tacconi co-presidency, economic and financial ruin made the club sink to its lowest ebb. =A.S. Varese 1910= In July 2004, the bankrupt Varese Football Club was reformed under a new board, and called A.S. Varese 1910. The club was forced to start afresh in the Eccellenza league. The Sogliano family took control of the team, with Riccardo Sogliano assuming overall control. The former player of Varese and A.C. Milan, has experience controlling clubs in Serie A: Parma F.C. and the Genoa C.F.C.. In its first season the new board suffered from delay and inexperience, and promotion to Serie D was missed narrowly due to points dropped early on in the season to the club's eventual title-rivals. Club President Peo Maroso and general manager Luca Sogliano, son of Riccardo and also a former player, decided to install a new first-team coach from within. Devis Mangia, at just 32 years of age, was the youngest head coach of the division and, probably, the entire league. The club has also had problems with its supporters (in particular a supporters group named \\"Blood and Honour\\") who treated black players badly. It happened in spring of 2002 with French players, Mohamed Benhassen, Samir Benhassen and the Cameroonian goalkeeper, Andr√® Joel Ebou√©. They were at the stadium every weekend and often fight with rival supporters. In season 2005/2006, Varese won the Serie D/A league, thus gaining promotion to Serie C2, three matches before the end of the season. In season 2008/2009, they won Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, and were promoted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione, the third level of Italian football system. Varese finished second in Girone (Group) A of League Pro Prima Divisione and qualified for promotion play-offs at next season. Varese defeated Benevento in semi-final and Cremonese in final and returned to Serie B after 25 years of absence with making second consecutive promotion. At the end of season 2011/12, A.S. Varese achieved fifth place in Serie B, qualifying for the play-offs for promotion into Serie A.https://int.soccerway.com/teams/italy/as-varese-1910 Drawn against Hellas Verona they won 3‚Äì1 on aggregate to qualify for the two-legged final against Sampdoria. Although a narrow 3‚Äì2 defeat in the initial leg in Genova held the promise to be a useful result for Varese, their rivals scored the only goal in the home leg, giving Sampdoria a 4‚Äì2 aggregate victory and denying Varese the promotion.https://int.soccerway.com/national/italy/serie-b/2011-2012/s6142/final- stages =S.S.D. Varese Calcio= After their relegation from Serie B in the 2014‚Äì15 season, Varese 1910 failed to meet the deadline to register for Lega Pro and the club declared bankruptcy. The club would be reformed to play again in Eccellenza for the 2015‚Äì16 season as Varese Calcio SSD. After winning its group it played Serie D, reaching play-off stage. In season 2017-18 Varese Calcio started without any president and in November its trainer Vincenzo Iacolino resigned due to the increasing economical crisis. The team finished its group in 18th and was relegated to the Eccellenza. On 14 July 2019, the club dissolved due to financial issues. A.S.D. Citt√† di Varese, a club also based in Varese, was formed 12 days later; in their first season, they won the 2019‚Äì20 Terza Categoria Varese Group B, the lowest tier of the Italian football pyramid.

Other common names refer to variations on the common name of its prey, including woodlouse hunter, sowbug hunter, sowbug killer, pillbug hunter and slater spider. Appearance Female specimens are long, while males are . They have six eyes, a dark-red cephalothorax and legs, and a shiny (sometimes very shiny) yellow-brown abdomen. Notably, they have disproportionately large chelicerae for a spider of this size. Dysdera crocata is difficult to distinguish from the much less common Dysdera erythrina though this species is not often found near human habitation. Distribution Dysdera crocata, which originated in the Mediterranean area, now has a cosmopolitan distribution (see map), ranging from Eurasia to parts of North and South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Behavior Woodlouse spiders are usually found under logs, rocks, bricks, plant pots and in leaf litter in warm places, often close to woodlice. They have also been found in houses. They spend the day in a silken retreat made to enclose crevices in, generally, partially decayed wood, but sometimes construct tent- like structures in indents of various large rocks. Woodlouse spiders hunt at night and do not spin webs. Male Dysdera crocata Their diet consists principally of woodlice which‚Äîdespite their tough exoskeleton‚Äîare pierced easily by the spider's large chelicerae; the spider usually stabs and injects venom into the woodlouse's soft underbelly while avoiding any noxious defensive chemicals. Laboratory experiments have shown D. crocata will take other invertebrates, and shows no particular preference for woodlice; these are simply the most common prey in its habitat. Other invertebrates preyed on by D. crocata include silverfish, earwigs, millipedes, burying beetles and crickets. This small but relatively large-fanged spider is very well equipped to prey on underground invertebrates of almost any kind. Because of its relatively large fangs and wide gape, the woodlouse spider is an unusually dominant predator for its size. Like many other Dysdera spiders, it frequently dominates, and sometimes kills, other spiders and centipedes. The courtship of these spiders is typically aggressive and mates risk injury from each other's large chelicerae. The female lays her eggs in a silken sac and is believed to look after her young after hatching. They have been known to bite humans if handled. Verified bites have caused no major medical problems. Localized itchiness at the bite site has been reported in some cases. References External links * Platnick, Norman I. (2008): The world spider catalog, version 8.5.

The Trailhead provides vehicle parking and is located at the end of Mt Blue Road, a mostly dirt road. Once on foot, hiking distance from Trailhead to summit . Mount Blue offers a very steep, rocky, and strenuous trail which is well marked leading to the summit. Hikers should realize that climbing this trail is quite steep, rocky and therefore risky; an injury can leave a hiker in serious trouble on this mountain. Experienced, athletic hikers may be able to make this aggressive climb in roughly 1.5‚Äì2 hours, while recreational hikers may take 2‚Äì3 hours to reach the summit. At the summit there are stunning views to the North, East and South and an observation platform on a cell phone tower. Nearby lakes West of Mount Blue is Webb Lake, a very shallow lake.

It counts the homogeneous polynomials of a given total degree d that are invariants for G. It is named for Theodor Molien. Formulation More formally, there is a vector space of such polynomials, for each given value of d = 0, 1, 2, ..., and we write nd for its vector space dimension, or in other words the number of linearly independent homogeneous invariants of a given degree. In more algebraic terms, take the d-th symmetric power of V, and the representation of G on it arising from œÅ. The invariants form the subspace consisting of all vectors fixed by all elements of G, and nd is its dimension. The Molien series is then by definition the formal power series :M(t) = \\\\sum_d n_d t^d. This can be looked at another way, by considering the representation of G on the symmetric algebra of V, and then the whole subalgebra R of G-invariants. Then nd is the dimension of the homogeneous part of R of dimension d, when we look at it as graded ring. In this way a Molien series is also a kind of Hilbert series. Without further hypotheses not a great deal can be said, but assuming some conditions of finiteness it is then possible to show that the Molien series is a rational function. The case of finite groups is most often studied. Formula Molien showed that : M(t) = \\\\frac{1}{G} \\\\sum_{g\\\\in G} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\det(I-t\\\\rho(g))} This means that the coefficient of td in this series is the dimension nd defined above. It assumes that the characteristic of the field does not divide G (but even without this assumption, Molien's formula in the form G \\\\cdot M(t) = \\\\sum_{g\\\\in G} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\det(I-t\\\\rho(g))} is valid, although it does not help with computing M(t)). Example Consider the symmetric group S_3 acting on R3 by permuting the coordinates. We add up the sum by group elements, as follows. Starting with the identity, we have : \\\\det \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1-t & 0 & 0  0 & 1-t & 0  0 & 0 & 1-t \\\\end{pmatrix} = (1-t)^3 . There is a three-element conjugacy class of S_3, consisting of swaps of two coordinates. This gives three terms of the form : \\\\det \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -t & 0  -t & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1-t \\\\end{pmatrix} = (1-t)(1-t^2). There is a two-element conjugacy class of cyclic permutations, yielding two terms of the form : \\\\det \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -t & 0  0 & 1 & -t  -t & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} =(1-t^3). Notice that different elements of the same conjugacy class yield the same determinant. Thus : M(t) = \\\\frac16\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{(1-t)^3} + \\\\frac3{(1-t)(1-t^2)} + \\\\frac{2}{1-t^3}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{(1-t)(1-t^2)(1-t^3)}. On the other hand, we can expand the geometric series and multiply out to get : M(t) = (1 + t + t^2 + t^3 + \\\\ldots)(1+ t^2 + t^4 + \\\\ldots)(1 + t^3 + t^6 + \\\\ldots) = 1 + t + 2t^2 + 3t^3 + 4t^4 + 5t^5 + 6t^6 + 7t^7 + 9 t^8 + 11 x^9\\\\ldots The coefficients of the series tell us the number of linearly independent homogeneous polynomials in three variables which are invariant under permutations of the three variables, i.e. the number of independent symmetric polynomials in three variables. In fact, if we consider the elementary symmetric polynomials : \\\\sigma_1 = x + y + z : \\\\sigma_2 = xy + xz + yz : \\\\sigma_3 = xyz we can see for example that in degree 5 there is a basis consisting of \\\\sigma_3 \\\\sigma_2, \\\\sigma_3 \\\\sigma_1^2, \\\\sigma_2^2 \\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_1^3 \\\\sigma_2 and \\\\sigma_1^5 . (In fact, if you multiply the series out by hand, you can see that the t^k term comes from combinations of t, t^2 and t^3 exactly corresponding to combinations of \\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_2 and \\\\sigma_3, also corresponding to partitions of k with 1, 2, and 3 as parts. See also Partition (number theory) and Representation theory of the symmetric group.) References *David A. Cox, John B.

They went on hiatus in 2002. Members of the band went on to form or join the bands The Chinese Stars, Athletic Automaton, Made in Mexico, and most recently Doomsday Student. The band reformed in 2010 but promptly disbanded.  History  Arab on Radar in 2010 at AS220 in Providence, Rhode Island Arab on Radar's first show was in the cafeteria on the Rhode Island College campus. While the band was opening for Marilyn Manson at a Providence club called Babyhead, they were chased out of the club by angry audience members. Arab on Radar's early sound was typified by thickly distorted, repeated bass grooves, 4/4 drum beats, and two deafening guitars that employed contrasting melodies and near-unison chords that drew comparisons to The Contortions. Their live shows often featured spitting, trisomic parody, and full nudity. After Andrea Fiset's departure, the band developed a more abstract sound and they began to draw (often disparaging) comparisons to Sonic Youth. Arab on Radar may be considered catalysts for the revival of no wave (also called neo-no wave), a scene that began to gain popularity with bands like Lightning Bolt and The Locust in the early part of the 21st century. Three One G released an Arab on Radar DVD entitled Sunshine for Shady People in 2008. It includes a short documentary and footage from a number of live performances. All of Arab on Radar's album cover art was created by Matt Brinkman. On April 13, 2010 Justin Pearson announced on his Facebook page that Arab on Radar reformed. On April 26, Skin Graft Records announced that Arab on Radar would perform at Dude Fest 2010, with more tour dates to follow. The band did tour the east coast, however they cancelled west coast dates and their new album's recording session(s) for unknown reasons. In an interview with the New York Press, the band responded to a question on how their politics have changed over the years: > The four of us never use or view the band as a political platform. We like > to keep the band separate from our views although there have been times that > we've adhered to certain questionable belief systems to get through airport > security.

The motion can be rotary or linear, depending on the type of actuator. Principle of operation Globe control valve with pneumatic diaphragm actuator and \\"smart\\" positioner which will also feed back to the controller the actual valve position Pneumatic rack and pinion actuators for valve controls of water pipes A Pneumatic actuator mainly consists of a piston or a diaphragm which develops the motive power. It keeps the air in the upper portion of the cylinder, allowing air pressure to force the diaphragm or piston to move the valve stem or rotate the valve control element. Valves require little pressure to operate and usually double or triple the input force. The larger the size of the piston, the larger the output pressure can be. Having a larger piston can also be good if air supply is low, allowing the same forces with less input. These pressures are large enough to crush objects in the pipe. On 100 kPa input, you could lift a small car (upwards of 1,000 lbs) easily, and this is only a basic, small pneumatic valve. However, the resulting forces required of the stem would be too great and cause the valve stem to fail. This pressure is transferred to the valve stem, which is connected to either the valve plug (see plug valve), butterfly valve etc. Larger forces are required in high pressure or high flow pipelines to allow the valve to overcome these forces, and allow it to move the valves moving parts to control the material flowing inside. The valves input is the \\"control signal.\\" This can come from a variety of measuring devices, and each different pressure is a different set point for a valve. A typical standard signal is 20‚Äì100 kPa. For example, a valve could be controlling the pressure in a vessel which has a constant out-flow, and a varied in-flow (varied by the actuator and valve). A pressure transmitter will monitor the pressure in the vessel and transmit a signal from 20‚Äì100 kPa. 20 kPa means there is no pressure, 100 kPa means there is full range pressure (can be varied by the transmitters calibration points). As the pressure rises in the vessel, the output of the transmitter rises, this increase in pressure is sent to the valve, which causes the valve to stroke downward, and start closing the valve, decreasing flow into the vessel, reducing the pressure in the vessel as excess pressure is evacuated through the out flow. This is called a direct acting process. Types Some types of pneumatic actuators include: *Tie rod cylinders *Rotary actuators *Grippers *Rodless actuators with magnetic linkage or rotary cylinders *Rodless actuators with mechanical linkage *Pneumatic artificial muscles *Vane Motors *Speciality actuators that combine rotary and linear motion‚Äîfrequently used for clamping operations *Vacuum generators See also *Pneumatic cylinder *Pneumatics Category:Actuators ","title":"Pneumatic actuator"},{"id":"3420092","text":"Yahoo Calendar is a Web-based calendar service from Yahoo!.

He is credited as the founding father of Iran's first modern Medical School.This short biography relies thankfully on a paper by Esmail Yourdshahian, MSc, Farrokh Ghavam, MD, and Mohhamad-Hassan Ansari, PhD, from Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran. For details see References below. Personal life Joseph Cochran's father, the Reverend Joseph Gallup Cochran (1817-1871), and his mother, Deborah Wilber Plumb (1820-1893), were first-generation American missionaries who traveled to Iran in 1848. They settled in Urmia, Western Azarbaijan, Iran, home to the people of the ancient culture of Urartu and of one of the earliest Christian churches, the Assyrian Church of the East. The family devoted their missionary zeal to the well-being of the local population, many of whom were devout Christians. The young Joseph was one of the eight children of Cochran's family. He had a happy childhood in the company of his large family and friends. He learnt the local Assyrian, Azerbaijani and Kurdish, in addition to English and Persian. He left for America as a teenager in 1868, staying in Buffalo, N.Y. with the family of Stephen Mallory Clement (1825-1892), the father of Stephen Merrell Clement, who was to help finance not only Joseph Cochran's education, but also his hospital. He studied medicine at New York Medical College, from where he graduated in 1876. Subsequently, he did two years of practical hospital work in surgery, infectious diseases and gynecology. During a travel to Minnesota he met his future wife, Katherine Hale. Medical Career in Urmia Dr Joseph Plumb Cochran working in a Christian mission in Urmia, Iran in the 1890s The young couple went to Iran in 1878. Upon their arrival in Urmia they surveyed the medical and health needs of the community and found the existing small health clinic, which was working under the auspices of the Iranian Red Lion and Sun Society, inadequate. On Joseph's earnest request, the Board of Assyrian Missionary purchased a 15-hectare garden which was soon to become the site of a 100-bed hospital, named Westminster Hospital, after the church in Buffalo, N.Y. that was the vehicle for supporting Dr. Cochran's work. The building of this hospital was completed within one year from its original planning and the hospital opened its doors in 1879. Cochran resolved the problem of shortage in the local medical professionals by establishing a modern Medical School, the first of its kind in Iran. For this purpose he erected a wooden building, which included a research laboratory, near the hospital, where the future medical personnel were to be trained. Remarkably, this original wooden building, near the present-day Urmia Medical School, is still intact. An adjoining maternity hospital was built later, for which the required medical equipment arrived from America. According to the information provided by the official website of Urmia University,University of Urmia, Western Azarbaijan, Iran: About University (in Persian). Joseph Cochran has been [the first] director of the Medical School in Urmia, established in 1878. In the course of Cochran's 27 years of directorship, 26 medical students graduated from this School. This School was closed on Joseph Cochran's death in 1905 and remained in this state until sixty years later when it was opened as one of several Schools of Urmia University. The historical archives of Urmia University is in the possession of documents that show that Mozaffar al- Din Shah Qajar and Joseph Cochran have personally signed and handed certificates to graduating students during the graduation ceremony of 1898 (1277 AH). Seer cemetery During the above-mentioned period, Joseph Cochran was joined by other American medical doctors, including Dr Wright, Dr Homlz, Dr van Norden, and Dr Miller, who remained permanently in Iran.Unfortunately the full names of these individuals were not available at the time of this writing. Their resting places are in Urmia. Joseph Cochran died in Urmia at the age of 50, on 18 August 1905, on the second floor of his wooden house in the Medical School. His death was mourned by many. According to reports, his funeral was attended by tens of thousands people. He was buried in the Assyrian Missionary Cemetery located on the side of Seer Mountain in Urmia facing his wooden house, close to the resting places of his wife Catherine and her parents. His epitaph reads: \\"He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\\" \\"Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.\\" (Matthew 20:26-28). His son, Joseph P. Cochran, Jr, returning to Iran in 1920, followed in his father's footsteps through his services in the American Mission Hospital. His daughter, Dorothy Cochran-Romson, served for a short time as a missionary nurse in Tabriz capital East Azerbaijan Province in Iran.

Rolfe's best-known work, this novel of extreme wish-fulfilment developed out of an article he wrote on the Papal Conclave to elect the successor to Pope Leo XIII. Plot The prologue introduces us to George Arthur Rose (a transparent double for Rolfe himself): a failed candidate for the priesthood denied his vocation by the machinations and bungling of the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical machinery, and now living alone with his yellow cat. Rose is visited by two prominent churchmen, one a Cardinal Archbishop. The two propose to right the wrongs done to him, ordain him a priest, and take him to Rome where the Conclave to elect the new Pope has reached deadlock. When he arrives in Rome he finds that the Cardinals have been inspired, divinely or otherwise, to offer him the Papacy. He accepts, and since the only previous English Pope was Adrian (or Hadrian) IV, he takes the name Hadrian VII. The novel develops with this unconventional, chain-smoking Englishman peremptorily reforming the Church and the early 20th-century world, against inevitable opposition from the established Roman Catholic hierarchy, rewarding his friends and trouncing his enemies. Generally he gets his way by charm or doggedness, and of course by being much cleverer than all those round him; but his short reign is brought to an end when he is assassinated by a Pope-hating Scotsman, or possibly Ulsterman, and the world breathes a sigh of relief. Later works based on or influenced by Hadrian the Seventh In 1908 Rolfe resurrected the character of Hadrian for The Bull Against the Enemy of the Anglican Race, a violent attack on Lord Northcliffe and his newspaper, the Daily Mail, cast in the form of a Papal Bull issued by Hadrian VII. The novel was made into a successful stage-play by Peter Luke, opening at the Mermaid Theatre, London in April 1968 and starring Alec McCowen as Fr. William Rolfe (not Rose). The subsequent Broadway production at the old Helen Hayes Theatre starred first McCowen, then Roderick Cook, and later, Barry Morse. It was also Morse who played in an Australian production and a USA national tour. A satirical novel on a similar theme, which mentions Hadrian the Seventh in its bibliography, is Robert Player's Let's Talk of Graves, of Worms, of Epitaphs (1972). The Translation of Father Torturo (2005), a novel by Brendan Connell about a priest's ruthless ascent to the papacy, is dedicated to \\"Frederick William Serafino Austin Lewis Mary Rolfe, Baron Corvo\\", \\"for the design which I so meanly twisted\\". Reception In 2014, The Guardian placed Hadrian the Seventh 37th in its list of the 100 best novels. Robert McCrum called it \\"entertaining if contrived [‚Ä¶] orchidaceous, eccentric and weirdly obsessive, some would say mad.\\" References External links * Category:1904 British novels Category:Catholic novels Category:English novels Category:Fictional popes Category:Novels set in Vatican City Category:Works published under a pseudonym ","title":"Hadrian the Seventh"},{"id":"3420120","text":"John Gennings (c. 1570 - 12 November 1660) was an Englishman who was converted to Catholicism through the martyrdom of his elder brother Saint Edmund Gennings during the English Reformation. He restored the English province of Franciscan friars. His name is sometimes spelled Jennings. Martyrdom of Edmund Gennings Edmund Gennings converted to Catholicism at the age of about sixteen, and soon after went to Rheims to study for the priesthood. On returning to England, he met his younger brother, John, near Ludgate Hill, and spoke to him without disclosing his identity. He said merely that he was a kinsman, and asked the young man what had become of his brother Edmund. John told him that \\"He had heard he was gone to Rome to the Pope, and was become a notable Papist and a traitor both to God and his country, and that if he did return he would be hanged infallibly.\\" Edmund, not judging the time right to begin an attempt at converting his brother, told him who he was, but without mentioning his priesthood. The brothers separated soon after, and Edmund continued his short ministry until he was arrested on 7 November 1591, after saying Mass in the house of Swithun Wells at Gray's Inn. He was hanged, drawn, and quartered on 10 December, outside that house. Conversion of John Gennings John Gennings, who subsequently wrote a Life of his brother, recounts his own conversion through his brother's martyrdom. On page 98, of the Life (which was published in 1614 at Saint-Omer), speaking of himself in the third person, he writes, :This martyr's brother, called John Genings, being in London at the very time of his brother's apprehension, condemnation, and execution, hearing of the same, rather rejoiced than any way bewailed the untimely and bloody end of his nearest kinsman, hoping thereby to be rid of all persuasions, which he mistrusted he should receive from him touching the Catholic religion. But about ten days after his execution, towards night, having spent all that day in sport and jollity, being weary with play, he resorted home, where, to repose himself, he went into a secret chamber. He was no sooner there set down, but forthwith his heart began to be heavy, and he began to weigh how idly he had spent that day. Amidst these thoughts there presently was represented to his mind a strange imagination and apprehension of the death of his brother, and amongst other things, how he had not long before forsaken all worldly pleasures and, for his religion only, endured intolerable torments. Then within himself he made long discourses concerning his religion and his brother's, comparing the Catholic manner of living with his, and finding the one to embrace pain and mortification, and the other to seek pleasure. the one to live strictly, and the other licentiously; the one to fear sin, the other to run into all kinds of sin. Upon this, being struck with exceeding terror and remorse, he wept bitterly, desiring God, after his fashion, to illuminate his understanding that he might see and perceive the truth. Oh! what great joy and consolation did he feel ath that instant; what reverence on the sudden did he begin to bear to the Blessed Virgin and to the Saints of God, which before he had never scarce heard tell of; what strange motions, as it were inspirations, with exceeding readiness of will to change his religion, took possession of his soul; and what a heavenly conceit had he now of his dear brother's felicity! He imagined he saw him; he thought he heard him. In this ecstasy of mind, he made a vow upon the spot, as he lay prostrate on the ground, To forsake kindred and country to find out the true knowledge of his brother's faith; which vow he soon after performed, and departed England without advertising any one of his friends, and went beyoned the seas to execute his promise. Being received into the Church, he entered Douai College, was ordained as a priest in 1607, and the following year was sent upon the English mission. Here he conceived a wish for the restoration of the English province of Franciscans, and sought out Father William Staney, the Commissary of the English friars, and from him received the habit (became a Franciscan), either in 1610 or 1614 (the date is uncertain). After this, he went for a time to a convent of the Franciscan order at Ypres, in Flanders, where he was joined by several English companions, amongst whom was Christopher Davenport, known in religion as Franciscus a Sancta Clara, afterwards a famous controversialist. Thus was the foundation of a new English province laid, and Father William Staney recognising the zeal of John Gennings, now gave into his hands the seal of the old province of the English Observants. The Restoration of the English Franciscans Gennings next proceeded to procure a house for the English friars at Gravelines, but in 1618 he obtained leave from the minister general to establish a settlement at Douai. As a matter of fact, most of the friars who had joined Gennings were graduates of Douai College, and in transferring the residence to that town he hoped to obtain a continuous supply of recruits. Franciscan Crest The work of restoring the English province was definitely entrusted to him by the general chapter of 1618, and he was nominated \\"Vicar of England\\". To assist him in the work of restoration, the commissary general of the Belgian nation was empowered to gather together all the English and Scottish friars from any province in the order. A decree of the same general chapter placed the English Poor Clares of Gravelines under the jurisdiction of English friars. =Custos= In 1625, the number of the English friars having greatly increased, Gennings sent Father Franciscus a Sancta Clara to Rome to plead (to provide an argument for) that the English province be canonically established (i.e. accepted according to Canon law). The request was granted with the simple restriction that the superior of the province should not assume the title of provincial, but that of custos. =Establishment of the Convent at Taunton= In 1629, this restriction was taken away and Friar John Gennings was appointed minister provincial. The first chapter of the new province was held at Brussels in Advent (roughly, December) of the same year, in the convent of the English sisters of the third order, which Gennings had himself founded in 1619. This community of tertiary sisters was established at Taunton, in England, with a branch house at Woodchester. Father John Gennings was re-elected provincial in 1634, and again in 1643. John Gennings died in Douai on 12 November 1660. Notes #Catholic Where Catholic is used in the article it refers to Roman Catholic. Catholic (on its own) has been mainly used in the article to aid the flow and to remain true to the primary source. #Franciscans More correctly, Order of Friars Minor #Observants. Such a vigorous and sturdy order as the Franciscans were bound to develop various strands. The central point of division over the ages was the extent to which the austere (severe?) regime laid down by the Saint need be followed. There was usually a distinction made by those followers who wished to retain the austerity of Francis, the Observants were such a group. See Franciscans for a wider treatment of this and a description of Francis' Testament #Custos, A superior in the Franciscan order, also used in England as guardian. #Sisters of the Third Order The Sisters have traditionally divided into two branches, one an enclosed contemplative order, the other, the Third Order, an 'open' order who undertook such work as teaching, nursing, or the Missions. They should not be confused with the male Third Order, which St Francis created for those of his followers who could not leave their homes. #Wider View See Franciscan Order in modern times for a wider view of which this English Restoration is but a part.

Its transmitter and antenna array are located off Hungerford Drive (Maryland Route 355), near the northern border of the city of Rockville. WLXE is under ownership of Multicultural Broadcasting. History The station was established in 1947 as Silver Spring-based WOOK, the first station of Richard Eaton's United Broadcasting with African American programming. Four years later, Eaton bought WINX, a station in Washington, D.C. proper. In order to retain both stations and meet multiple ownership rules, the Silver Spring station license was relocated to Rockville, Maryland‚Äîwhich under pre-1950 Census Bureau guidelines was not part of the Washington metropolitan area‚Äîon 1600 kHz. Additionally, Eaton switched the two stations' call letters, resulting in WOOK as the new 1340 in Washington, D.C., and WINX as the station at 1600 in Rockville. Through to the late 1970s, WINX broadcast a Top-40 format. It was located at 8 Baltimore Road off Church Street near the intersection of Veirs Mill Road and Rockville Pike. It was consistently the third-ranked Top 40 station in the ratings, following WPGC and WEAM. The station shifted to an oldies format in 1993 (simulcast on FM 94.3 Warrenton), then followed by a short stint as top-40 again around 1998 in the FM-dominated market. During the 1990s, WINX was the flagship for American University Athletics; Chuck Timanus served as lead play-by-play announcer, with his blind son Eddie Timanus, later a famous game show contestant and sportswriter, serving as a statistician.

Office for National Statistics & Norfolk County Council (2001). Retrieved 20 June 2009. increasing to a population of 618 in 217 households at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of Breckland. Litcham is in the Launditch hundredLaunditch hundred of the Breckland district of Norfolk, England. It is almost equidistant from three major market towns: East Dereham, Fakenham and Swaffham. The Bull Inn is a 17th-century coaching inn with parts dating back to the 14th century. It is the one surviving of many pubs once serving the village. The village has all the necessary amenities such as a post office, butchers, church, Methodist chapel, bus garage, fish and chip shop and health centre. History Litcham is mentioned in the Domesday Book under the name Licham, Lecham or Leccham as 'a Market Town in the centre of Norfolk'. Other known spellings are Lucham, Lycham, Luychesham to mention but a few. Edward I granted Litcham the right to hold a weekly market, but it did not thrive and had ceased by 1836. However it has left its mark on the layout of Litcham and is probably the reason why Church Street widens out so dramatically just below All Saints Church. In Elizabethan times the village was the centre of the local tanning industry. The Collinson and Hallcottis families made considerable fortunes and became country squires. The Hallcottis' were local benefactors, building almshouses and paying for a church bell. Mathew Hallcottis is shown on the village sign with his tanning equipment. In 1831 its population reached 771; more than a third of these were agricultural workers. In 1977 it was designated a conservation village and boasts eleven listed buildings plus a church and priory that date back to the 12th century. The village sits astride a major crossroads of country lanes, the most important of which is the B1145 which stretches between King's Lynn and Norwich and was once the King's Lynn - Norwich - Great Yarmouth stagecoach route. Horses would have been changed at the 17th-century Bull Inn, which also served as the local law court until the late 18th century. On the green in front of the Bull Inn there once stood a row of old cottages and a chapel, which were demolished in 1968. Litcham Secondary School in 2017. All Saints Church Litcham is served by All Saints churchNorfolk churches in the Benefice of Litcham. The square tower was largely rebuilt in the early 15th century. The clock is dated 1725 and was made by the Swaffham blacksmith. The tower contains a peal of six bells, which are still rung today by the Litcham Bellringers. The unusual red and green painted rood screen was completed in 1536 and shows twenty-two painted images of saints. The tracery of the upper portions of the screen are carved with great delicacy. The female saints can be identified as Sitha, Cecilia, Dorothy, Juliana, Agnes, Petronella, Helena, and Ursula. The baptismal font is of the early 15th century and shows shields, now stripped of their identifying painted arms, on the bowl. The church also contains a wooden Dutch coffer, of which there are only five in the country, this used to be used for storing books. Also none of the faces on the statues have been erased unlike in other churches of the area. There is also a Methodist Chapel, built in 1909, on Front Street. Litcham Common Litcham Common is situated the south of the village and is a managed nature reserve consisting of 28 hectares of lowland heath and mixed woodlands. The Nar Valley Way long-distance footpath runs across the common, is never far from the river, and offers a variety of scenery along the country lanes and tracks. The path follows farm tracks through Lexham Estate; at each end it passes through commons managed as nature reserves at Litcham and Castle Acre. A Bronze Age burial mound or tumulus was discovered on the common and Roman settlements and roads have been found just outside the village. Grazing Scheme : In 2006 Litcham Common Management Committee put forward proposals to introduce grazing which is recommended as by far the best way of preserving this type of habitat. The Management Committee submitted a formal application to the Secretary of State for the erection of stock proof fencing which was approved on 12 February 2007. Fencing was erected in May 2008 and four wild Dartmoor ponies arrived in June 2008. The common is divided in two by the Dunham Road and the ponies currently only graze the western half there are now plans to install cattle grids on the Dunham Road to allow the ponies to graze whole of the common.

After being rejected by potential donors due to her age, Liz is shocked when Christian offers his sperm to her.

However, Liz later aborts the baby after she is told that her child will have severe birth defects if born. =Season Three= Due to a financial crisis at McNamara/Troy, Liz resigns and takes up on Julia's offer to work with her at the female-run business Spa De La Mer, where she becomes their resident General Practitioner. At the end of the season, Liz finds herself a prime suspect in the Carver mystery as she had access to Christian's sperm and could have been the one who planted it at one of the crime scenes. She is interrogated by detective Kit McGraw, but is eventually released. =Season Four= Now working for McNamara/Troy again, Liz witnesses her new boss Michelle Landau in a compromising position with a mystery woman. After offering Michelle emotional support, Liz finds herself accused of sexual harassment and is almost fired. Her paths again cross with Michelle when she falls victim to an elaborate kidney theft organized by Michelle's old friend James, forcing her to recover in hospital for weeks. She later embarks on a relationship with young anesthesiologist Poppy, a fitness freak who encourages Liz to go under the knife. Liz eventually comes to her senses and ends their relationship.

After Gallardo is shot dead by his wife, Liz helps Sean and Christian dispose of the body. =Season Five= Now residing in Los Angeles, Liz questions Julia's lesbian relationship with Olivia Lord, believing that she is simply experimenting.

They then get married and Wilber asks Liz if he can call her mom, to which an overjoyed Liz agrees, unaware that Christian has just received news of his remission, Christian does not have cancer. * The season 5 DVD features a deleted scene from the episode Duke Collins, where Liz and Olivia are seen sleeping together. Presumably this is not to be considered canon. =Season Six= Liz Cruz wants to be made partner in McNamara/Troy because of all the drama and crimes they have dragged her through over the years. However, because she is an anesthesiologist and not a plastic surgeon, she will not be made partner in their practice. Cruz has a date with a medical sales representative. Cruz brings her date to an orgasm but the date is a \\"squirter\\". This turns Cruz off, but Christian Troy talks her into staying with the woman.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2006 to 2017 and is second all-time in post-season appearances as a Dodger with 51. Drafted in the second round (62nd pick overall) of the 2003 MLB draft, Ethier played in the major leagues from 2006 through 2017, all for the Dodgers. Career highlights include All-Star selections in 2010 and 2011, a Silver Slugger Award in 2009, and a Gold Glove Award in 2011.

One of his three brothers, Devon, also played baseball at Gateway Community College and was drafted by the Dodgers in the 32nd round of the 2010 MLB draft. Amateur career =Junior college career= Ethier transferred to Chandler-Gilbert Community College after playing with Arizona State University in the fall of 2000. The coaching staff at ASU told him that they thought he did not have Division I talent, and that he would do better to play junior college ball. At CGCC, Ethier batted .468 and accumulated 94 hits, 32 of which were doubles. He was named team MVP. During the summer of 2001, he played with the Keene Swamp Bats in the New England Collegiate Baseball League. In 2010, Ethier was inducted into the NECBL Hall of Fame. =Arizona State= Ethier re-enrolled at ASU in the fall of 2001 and played there until the end of his junior year in 2003 with an ASU career batting average of .371, 113 runs, 27 doubles, 7 triples, 14 home runs and 118 runs batted in.

Professional career =MLB draft and minor leagues= Ethier was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 37th round of the 2001 amateur draft. Opting to attend ASU instead, he was drafted in the second round of the 2003 amateur draft, again by the Oakland Athletics. He signed with the Athletics on July 1, 2003. Oakland assigned him to the Single-A Vancouver Canadians and later to the Kane County Cougars for the 2003 season.

He also played four games in 2005 with the Sacramento River Cats Triple-A team. On December 13, 2005, Ethier was traded by the Oakland Athletics to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Milton Bradley and Antonio Perez. =Los Angeles Dodgers= 2006 season Ethier hit a double and drew a walk in his Major League Baseball debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 2, 2006, against the Arizona Diamondbacks in his home state of Arizona and hit his first home run the next night, against Dewon Brazelton of the San Diego Padres. Ethier in 2008 On May 19, Ethier had a breakout game, going 5-for-5 with four runs scored as he raised his batting average from .222 to .317. He remained hot throughout the summer and was named National League Player of the Week for the week ending July 9. Ethier's average peaked at .354 before a late slump dropped it to .308 at season's end. An early front-runner for the National League Rookie of the Year Award, he finished fifth in voting. 2007 season Ethier entered the 2007 season expecting to split time with Matt Kemp, and Luis Gonzalez in the outfield, but Ethier got a lot of playing time early due to an injury to Kemp. Although he began the season fairly slowly, hitting for a .250 average in April, over the course of the first three months to the season he managed to gradually raise his average. Overall, Ethier played in 153 games while batting .284, with 13 home runs, and 64 RBIs. 2008 season Ethier beat out Juan Pierre to become the Dodgers' starting left fielder for the start of the 2008 season. When the Dodgers acquired outfielder Manny Ramirez, he moved to his more natural position of right field, with Kemp playing center field. In the regular season, Ethier played in 141 games, had 525 at bats, scored 90 runs, had 160 hits, hit an average .305 batting average with 20 homers and 77 RBIs. 2009 season In 2009, Ethier hit .272 with a career-best 31 home runs and 106 RBI. For this performance, Ethier won a Silver Slugger Award and finished sixth in National League MVP voting. Ethier was a key contributor for the Dodgers that season, with six walk off hits (including four walk off home runs), the most by any player in the Major Leagues since 1974. His four walk-off home runs tied the Major League record for most in a season. On June 26, 2009, Ethier hit three home runs in a game against the Seattle Mariners, driving in a career-high six runs. 2010 season Ethier got off to a strong start to the 2010 season, leading the National League in home runs, RBIs, and batting average, but broke his pinky finger on his right hand during batting practice on May 15, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list three days later. On July 4, Ethier was selected to start on the National League All Star team, with more than 2.7 million votes. He slumped down the stretch, finishing with a .292 batting average, 23 home runs, and 82 RBIs in 139 games. 2011 season Ethier in 2011 Ethier set a new MLB record for April on April 26 against the Florida Marlins with a 23-game hitting streak, breaking the old record set by Joe Torre. On April 30 Ethier extended his streak to 27 games, moving past two former Dodgers to stand in second place in the franchise's history of hitting streaks and tie the Dodgers record for the most hits in April. The streak eventually reached 30 games, second-most in Dodger franchise history, before it ended on May 7 against the New York Mets. Ethier was a Final Vote candidate for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, but finished second to Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies. However, Victorino was injured and unable to participate so Ethier was selected to replace him on the All-Star roster. Ethier became the subject of some controversy in the second half of the season. Los Angeles Times columnist TJ Simers wrote an article that quoted Ethier as saying his production was down in 2011 because of a knee injury that he had been battling all season, and implying that the Dodgers were forcing him to play despite his injury. Manager Don Mattingly said he was \\"blindsided\\" by the story, and responded that he would never make a player play hurt. After a meeting with Mattingly and GM Ned Colletti, Ethier backed off on his comments and said it was his choice to play hurt. After the September 7 game, Ethier decided to shut down for the season in order to consult doctors on the problems with his knee, with the hope of getting healthy in time for spring training. Ethier appeared in 135 games with the Dodgers in 2011, hitting .291 with 11 home runs and 62 RBIs. Ethier won a Gold Glove Award on November 1, 2011. Clayton Kershaw and Matt Kemp also won Gold Gloves, giving the Dodgers three Gold Glove winners in one year for the first time in franchise history. 2012 season On June 12, Ethier signed a five-year contract extension with the Dodgers. The deal was for $85 million through 2017 with a $17.5 million vesting option for 2018. On August 25, Ethier got his tenth straight base hit, breaking the L.A. Dodger record set by Ron Cey in 1977 and tying the franchise record set by Ed Konetchy in 1919. On September 4 against the San Diego Padres, Ethier collected his 1,000th career hit on a solo homer in the 2nd inning. He played in 149 games in 2012, hitting .284 with 20 homers and 89 RBI. 2013 season Ethier at a 2013 spring training game against the Seattle Mariners in Peoria, Arizona. After being a corner outfielder for his entire career, Ethier was moved to center field for the first time in the Majors in 2013 because of injuries to Matt Kemp. On September 2, Ethier became the first player in Dodger history to record seven seasons with 30 or more doubles. His season though took a quick step back after getting injured. Beginning September 13, Ethier wore a walking boot for a sore foot that caused him to miss several games at the end of the season and limited him in the playoffs. For the entire season he played 142 games and hit .272 with 12 homers, 33 doubles, and 52 RBIs. 2014 season In late May, Ethier was once again moved to center field, becoming the starting center fielder for the Dodgers due to Kemp's defensive struggles. However, with Yasiel Puig moving to center field and Kemp's resurgence in right field, Ethier became a reserve for most of the second half of the season. General Manager Ned Colletti said he believed Ethier could become a needed late-inning power bat. His teammates praised him throughout the season for accepting his role and not creating problems, despite his rich contract. The Los Angeles Times mentioned that Ethier was able to remain completely professional over the entire situation, unlike some past Dodger players who would publicly complain about getting less time on the field and possibly losing their positions. Ethier continued to show up for the pre-game autographs and photos, continuing to remain normal and popular among his fans. Ethier played only 130 games, the fewest in his career since his rookie season, hitting .249/.322/.370 with 4 home runs and 42 RBIs, mostly in pinch-hit scenarios. 2015 season Due to early-season injuries to outfielders Puig and Carl Crawford, Ethier established himself as a near-everyday player in the first half of the season. On August 2, he hit two go-ahead home runs against the Angels, including a walk-off home run in the 10th inning, to earn the Dodgers their first three-game sweep over their city rivals since 2006. It was the seventh walk-off home run, and 14th walk- off hit, of Ethier's career, which placed him second all-time in franchise history behind only the 16 by Dusty Baker. He played in 142 games and hit .294 with 14 home runs and 53 RBI. 2016 season During spring training, Ethier suffered a fractured right tibia after fouling a ball off his shin in a game. The injury did not require surgery but he was expected to be out for 10‚Äì14 weeks. The injury was more severe than expected and Ethier did not rejoin the Dodgers' roster until September 10. He only appeared in 16 games, primarily as a pinch hitter, down the stretch, with five hits in 24 at-bats including one home run, batting .208/.269/.375. Ethier had six at-bats as a pinch hitter for the Dodgers in the playoffs with two hits, one of which was a home run. 2017 season For the second straight year, Ethier was injured during spring training. This time, he came down with a herniated disc in his back and again began the season on the disabled list. Ethier did not rejoin the Dodgers' active roster until September 1. In 34 at bats, he batted .235/.316/.441. Ethier was used as a pinch hitter primarily in the playoffs. In Game 6 of the 2017 World Series, he appeared in his 50th career post-season game, a new Dodgers franchise record. After the season, the Dodgers declined their 2018 option on Ethier, making him a free agent for the first time in his career. On November 26, 2017, Ethier announced he would retire. Hours later, he reversed the original announcement, and remained unsigned. On July 25, 2018, Ethier officially announced his retirement and the Dodgers announced that he would have a retirement ceremony on August 3 prior to the game against the Houston Astros. Career statistics In 1455 games over 12 seasons, Ethier posted a .285 batting average (1367-for-4800) with 641 runs, 303 doubles, 34 triples, 162 home runs, 687 RBI, 519 bases on balls, .359 on-base percentage and .463 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .986 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. In 51 postseason games, he batted .246 (31-for-126) with 18 runs, 6 doubles, 5 home runs, 11 RBI and 18 walks.

University of Virginia Press, 1911. Several hours prior to when the major combat began, Von Moltke had pleaded Hafiz Pasha to withdraw to a more secure and fortified position near Birecik and to await expected reinforcements, as Hafiz Pasha's forces were outmatched in quality by the advancing Egyptians. Initially Hafiz acquiesced to Moltke, but not long after he decided to maintain his army's position, due to the advice of his mullahs. The Ottoman troops under Hafiz Pasha were positioned at Mezar, southwest of Nezib, with the Nezib river on their left. Ibrahim advanced his force, under heavy Ottoman artillery fire, towards the Ottoman lines. At the same time, the Ottoman line began to take Egyptian artillery fire, and were suffering losses. By the time Ibrahim's infantry had encountered the Ottoman line, Hafiz's army was in complete rout, the Egyptian artillery having broken their morale.Masson, David, Macmillan's Magazine, p. 480.

It has sometimes been referred to as the Bricker ileal conduit after its inventor, Eugene M. Bricker. It is a form of incontinent urostomy, and was developed during the 1940s and is still one of the most used techniques for the diversion of urine after a patient has had their bladder removed, due to its low complication rate and high patient satisfaction level. It is usually used in conjunction with radical cystectomy in order to control invasive bladder cancer. Incontinent stoma as part of a Bricker ileal conduit. To create an ileal conduit, the ureters are surgically resected from the bladder and a ureteroenteric anastomosis is made in order to drain the urine into a detached section of ileum at the distal small intestine, though the distal most 25 cm of terminal ileum are avoided as this is where bile salts are reabsorbed. The end of the ileum is then brought out through an opening (a stoma) in the abdominal wall. The residual small bowel is reanastamosed with the residual terminal ileum, usually seated inferior relative to the anastomosis. The urine is collected through a bag that attaches on the outside of the body over the stoma. The bag is changed every 3 to 5 days, or as directed by a stomal therapist. The risk of infection is actually quite small, but there is a high risk of stomal breakdown if not cared for correctly. Another and very effective use of an ileal conduit is for systemic isolation of a kidney transplant, often due to bladder neuropathy that may pose an unacceptable risk of reflux and thus infection or obstruction, into the transplanted organ. The urostomy is fashioned as previously described and connected by ureteroenteric anastomosis to the transplant ureter. Urinary tract infections are unfortunately very common because stomas are natural colonisers of bacteria; in transplant patients, antibiotic treatment, often over a long term and more frequent appliance changes are effective but not curative countermeasures. The bag adheres to the skin using a disk made of flexible, adherent materials. Unfortunately, there can be problems with leaking and rashes (excoriation), and heavy physical exertion will exacerbate deterioration of the appliance. Sometimes the leakage occurs unexpectedly, and \\"ostomates\\" (as they are known) usually carry a spare appliance to deal with unexpected emergencies.

Character history Kimber is a one-time model, pornographic actress, and pornography director and producer. She is one of six series regulars, usually at the center of the show's sometimes boundary-pushing and controversial storylines. Originally a guest star in the pilot episode, Kimber was promoted to a recurring character for the show's first two seasons before finally becoming a series regular in season three, in part due to both critical and audience acclaim for actress Kelly Carlson's performance. A troubled blonde bombshell, with an anachronistic hairstyle inspired by Marilyn Monroe, Kimber was initially envisaged as a blond, \\"tarty\\" model from South Beach until Carlson instilled vulnerability into her performance, ultimately rendering Kimber empathetic. Carlson is also responsible for some of Kimber's quirks and self-exploration, and has said she enjoys playing a character who is trying to find herself. Series creator Ryan Murphy has noted Kimber's many \\"incarnations\\" through each additional season, her constant reinvention reflective of the series itself.Nip/TuckForum Ryan Murphy post In an interview with Entertainment Weekly published online a day after the airing of Kimber's suicide episode, actress Kelly Carlson confirmed Kimber's death, but promised that she reappears in visions, and as Christian's conscience. =Season One= Aspiring model Kimber meets Christian Troy at a bar. She is initially uninterested in him, before being told that he is a plastic surgeon. The two of them have wild sex, but the following morning Christian tells her that she is an \\"8 out of 10\\" and can make her a \\"10\\" by operating on her. After undergoing painful surgery and being ignored by Christian,episode \\"Pilot\\" (1.1) she vandalizes both his luxurious sports car and his boat.episode \\"Megan O'Hara\\" (1.6) While investigating the culprit, Christian rekindles their relationship and they begin dating. However, Kimber can't match Christian's playboy lifestyle, so Christian strikes a deal with Merrill Bobolit to push Kimber into his arms as a \\"trade\\" for Bobolit's prized Lamborghini Diablo. The trade works, but when Kimber discovers the truth she attacks Christian, tying him to his bed and slicing him with a knife.episode \\"Sofia Lopez II\\" (1.9) Kimber takes the car, and later becomes engaged to Bobolit.episode \\"Escobar Gallardo\\" (1.13) However, she breaks off their engagement when Bobolit loses his medical license and practice. =Season Two= Christian reunites with Kimber when he discovers that she has been in contact with Gina Russo and will give evidence against him in the custody battle for baby Wilber. Christian initially plays on Kimber's remaining attraction to him, but is repulsed when her cocaine addiction is revealed. Christian discovers that her nasal septum has been destroyed, and he offers to fix it for free provided she keeps quiet during the deposition. Despite dreams of becoming an actress, Kimber gets involved with porn and quickly becomes a hot commodity within the industry.episode \\"Mrs. Grubman\\" (2.4) She later returns to McNamara/Troy requesting surgery on the vagina of a life-size sex doll modeled on her image.episode \\"Kimber Henry\\" (2.10) Kimber wants Christian to perform the surgery, but he declines. While Sean creates a mold of her vagina, Kimber explains that she may be a masochist, as she loves Christian despite the pain he puts her through. Sean tells her that she is simply too trusting, and that he admires her spirit. Kimber soon discovers that Sean has had sex with her doll, and he gets to try out the real thing when the two of them engage in a brief affair. At dinner with Sean, Kimber explains that Alma, her psychic, told her that the heart line in her hand is broken in two, hinting at a love tragedy.

Christian proposes to Kimber, but tragedy strikes when Kimber is kidnapped from their wedding by The Carver. Christian assumes that Kimber left him, and he later has this confirmed via a Dear John letter penned by her (but only under order from The Carver).YouTube ‚Äì Nip/Tuck ‚Äì 3.11 Abby Mays -Kimber's letter Several weeks later, a dazed Kimber is found wandering along a Miami highway. It is revealed that The Carver has undone all of Kimber's previous surgeries without anesthesia, as well as carving his signature smile into her face.

She runs into Matt McNamara at the gym and introduces him to the cult through an E-meter test. Matt initially explores the faith in an effort to spend time with her, but Kimber tells him that she is uninterested in having a relationship with him. Kimber enrages Julia McNamara when she encourages Matt to move out of the McNamara home due to its \\"toxic environment\\". Christian talks Kimber into taking him back and they sleep together. The following morning Christian reveals that he was simply using her for sex, which destroys Kimber.YouTube ‚Äì christian troy kimber As revenge, Kimber sleeps with Matt. Weeks later, Kimber and Matt show up at McNamara/Troy and reveal that they are married and expecting a baby together. Christian believes the baby is secretly his, but DNA tests prove otherwise. Kimber and Matt move in together, and Matt films a porn movie with her in an effort to spice up their sex life. A hallucination of Xenu forces Kimber to come to terms with what she has done in the last year, while Matt confesses to Sean that he has known all along that Kimber only married him to get back at Christian but loves her anyway. Sean tells Kimber about Matt's true feelings for her, and she replies that she is trying to love him. =Season Five= Kimber and Matt travel to Los Angeles with their new baby girl Jenna in tow. Matt tells Sean and Christian that he has taken Jenna and left Kimber, but this is in fact a ruse to get money to pay for his and Kimber's spiraling addiction to crystal methamphetamine. Kimber tries to return to the porn industry, but is shot down by producer Ram Peters due to her habit. After quitting drugs through Scientology, Kimber agrees to dump Matt in return for surgery on her meth-ravaged face and teeth. Kimber tells Matt that she never loved him, and moves in with Ram. They announce their plans to marry, with Ram legally adopting Jenna. Kimber's idea of a picture- perfect family turns sour, however, when Ram invites Eden Lord into their relationship, molding her into Kimber's porn prot√©g√©. Four months later, Kimber has appeared to reconcile with Matt and has given him visitation rights. After dropping off Jenna, Kimber kisses Christian but laughs and recoils at the sight of his post-surgery breast cancer scar. She tells him that his cancer is karma for the way he has treated women over the years, and is surprised that something like it didn't happen sooner. Later, Jenna is spotted by baby-model scouts who wish to represent her, but only if she has collagen injected into her \\"thin, villainous lips\\". Kimber administers the collagen incorrectly, leading Christian to do the deed and rejects Kimber's decision to get Jenna a successful modeling career. After Ram throws her out to be with Eden, Kimber takes Jenna to live with Matt while she searches for an apartment and learns of Christian. Discovering that Christian is about to marry Liz and is dying from cancer, Kimber confronts Liz and tells her that she is the one who should be with Christian in his last days. Liz rejects the idea, believing that Kimber is only after Christian's wallet. Kimber shows up at the wedding ceremony uninvited. When the priest asks if anybody disagrees with the union, Kimber stands up with tears in her eyes. However, she silently leaves the church instead of speaking out.YouTube ‚Äì Nip / Tuck ‚Äì The Wedding ‚Äì \\"Kimber, sit down!\\" XD ‚Äì 5x22 =Season Six= After studying via night classes, Kimber becomes an electrology specialist,episode \\"Don Hoberman\\" (6.1) working out of a backroom at a nail salon in downtown Los Angeles.

Christian appeals to Kimber to leave Mike and marry him instead, but Kimber believes he is merely acting out as a result of seeing her with another man. Despite her ambivalence, Kimber pictures Christian's face while making love to Mike, ends their engagement and later asks for Christian to remove her new tattoo.episode \\"Alexis Stone\\" (6.6) Getting back together with Christian, Kimber is driven to bulimia following Christian's affair with an overweight woman and her own brief bout of binge eating, and later tells Christian that she hates herself, and that she constantly comes back to him because he \\"hates [her] the best\\". Despite claiming that Christian is only with her because he hates himself and believes that Kimber is all he deserves, she continues their relationship.episode \\"Lola Wlodkowski\\" (6.8) Soon after, Kimber reveals to Christian that she is pregnant. Because of his own desire not to have any more children and due to his opinions on Kimber's current parenting of Jenna, Christian tells her to get an abortion or lose him. The ultimatum continues when Christian promises to marry her if she goes through with what he wants. A desperate Kimber's attempts to seduce Mike end up backfiring on her, and she later confesses that she can't raise another child on her own. Visiting an abortion clinic, Kimber turns to Liz for help, opening up about her own love for Christian and how she can't live without him. Kimber has an abortion, but complications during surgery result in her being unable to have children again. Liz tells Christian that if he ever decides to leave Kimber, her inability to have children will remind him of what she sacrificed in order to be with him.episode \\"Wesley Clovis\\" (6.10) In the second half of the sixth season, Kimber is now working as an interior decorator, overseeing the remodeling of the McNamara/Troy practice. She is also married to Christian, but suspects that he has been sleeping with another designer working on the project.

Christian gets Sean to hire Kimber to decorate his new apartment, and Sean showers her with compliments after she reveals her work. This leads to a passionate secret affair between the two of them. Any sign of personal guilt from Kimber is alleviated when she discovers Christian has been spending time with one of his patients, a supermodel.episode \\"Willow Banks\\" (6.12) Her secret affair with Sean dampens her sex life with Christian, who at a patient's urging experiments with autoerotic asphyxiation. When nearly killing himself while performing the act, Christian has a moment of clarity in which he realizes that he can never love Kimber the way she needs to be loved and that he was meant to be alone. He kicks her out of his apartment and she, after talking with Sean, goes back to be with Mike on his boat. She tries to rekindle their relationship, but Mike isn't interested. At rock bottom, Kimber goes to the bow of the ship and jumps off. Christian learns of this 12 hours later, and though the Coast Guard is still searching for her she is presumed dead.episode \\"Joel Seabrook\\" (6.13) Kimber re-appears, first berating him for sleeping with her estranged mother,episode \\"Sheila Carlton\\" (6.14) and later reuniting with him on a beach while Christian is under anesthesia. Kimber tells Christian not to feel guilt for what happened to her. In his apartment, Christian tells her that he's missed her. They kiss, and Kimber (now inhabiting the body of Joan Rivers) tells Christian that nobody could have saved her, before saying goodbye to him. Kimber, back in her own body, then literally fades away.episode \\"Christian Troy II\\" (6.17) Kimber appears for the final time in another dream of Christian's, in which she tells him that she killed herself to get away from him, and that Sean too will end up the same way if Christian doesn't end their relationship.

Its probability density function (see the box) is given in terms of modified Bessel function of the second kind, denoted by K_\\\\lambda.Ole E Barndorff-Nielsen, Thomas Mikosch and Sidney I. Resnick, L√©vy Processes: Theory and Applications, Birkh√§user 2013 It was introduced by Ole Barndorff- Nielsen, who studied it in the context of physics of wind-blown sand.  Properties  =Linear transformation= This class is closed under affine transformations. =Summation= Barndorff-Nielsen and Halgreen proved that the GIG distribution is infinitely divisible and since the GH distribution can be obtained as a normal variance-mean mixture where the mixing distribution is the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution, Barndorff-Nielsen and Halgreen showed the GH distribution is infinitely divisible as well.O. Barndorff- Nielsen and Christian Halgreen, Infinite Divisibility of the Hyperbolic and Generalized Inverse Gaussian Distributions, Zeitschrift f√ºr Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und verwandte Gebiete 1977 =Fails to be convolution-closed= An important point about infinitely divisible distributions is their connection to L√©vy processes, i.e. at any point in time a L√©vy process is infinitely divisible distributed. Many families of well- known infinitely divisible distributions are so-called convolution-closed, i.e. if the distribution of a L√©vy process at one point in time belongs to one of these families, then the distribution of the L√©vy process at all points in time belong to the same family of distributions. For example, a Possion process will be Possion distributed at all points in time, or a Brownian motion will be normal distributed at all points in time. However, a L√©vy process that is generalised hyperbolic at one point in time might fail to be generalized hyperbolic at another point in time. In fact, the generalized Laplace distributions and the normal inverse Gaussian distributions are the only subclasses of the generalized hyperbolic distributions that are closed under convolution.  Related distributions  As the name suggests it is of a very general form, being the superclass of, among others, the Student's t-distribution, the Laplace distribution, the hyperbolic distribution, the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution and the variance-gamma distribution. * X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{GH}(-\\\\frac{ u}{2}, 0, 0, \\\\sqrt{ u}, \\\\mu)\\\\, has a Student's t-distribution with u degrees of freedom. * X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{GH}(1, \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\delta, \\\\mu)\\\\, has a hyperbolic distribution. * X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{GH}(-1/2, \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\delta, \\\\mu)\\\\, has a normal-inverse Gaussian distribution (NIG). * X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{GH}(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\\\\, normal-inverse chi- squared distribution * X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{GH}(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\\\\, normal-inverse gamma distribution (NI) * X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{GH}(\\\\lambda, \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, 0, \\\\mu)\\\\, has a variance-gamma distribution * X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{GH}(1, 1, 0, 0, \\\\mu)\\\\, has a Laplace distribution with location parameter \\\\mu and scale parameter 1.  Applications  It is mainly applied to areas that require sufficient probability of far-field behaviour, which it can model due to its semi-heavy tails--a property the normal distribution does not possess. The generalised hyperbolic distribution is often used in economics, with particular application in the fields of modelling financial markets and risk management, due to its semi-heavy tails.

They were influenced by C86, riot grrrl and the Fire Engines. Singer Jane McKeown is the sister of John McKeown from the Yummy Fur and the two bands often toured together. History Lung Leg formed in 1994 in Glasgow, Scotland, with a lineup of McKeown (\\"Jane Egypt\\") on bass and vocals, Annie Spandex and Maureen Quinn (\\"Morine Quim\\") on guitar and vocals, and Amanda Doorbar (\\"Jade Green\\") on drums. The quartet released The Negative Delinquent Autopsy (1994) and Shagg the Tiger (1995) EPs on the Piao! label; both were named \\"Single of the Week\\" by Melody Maker. The two EPs were later compiled together as the 1997 Hello Sir album on Kill Rock Stars. Doorbar left in 1996, replaced by Todd Parmenter. This second lineup recorded their debut album, Maid to Minx, released in 1997 on the Vesuvius label. The lyrics for the title track were written by Danny Saunders (now of Correcto). McKeown was also the drummer for labelmates Dick Johnson. When Quinn quit Lung Leg in 1997, they recruited her replacement, Philippa Smith, from Dick Johnson. This final lineup embarked on their sole tour of the US in 1998 with the Make-Up, and recorded two final singles, \\"Krayola\\" in 1998 and \\"Maid to Minx\\" (a new recording of the title track from the debut album) in 1999. Lung Leg split after a final farewell gig in May 1999; a remixed and partially rerecorded version of their debut album was released posthumously that August on Southern Records.

Gerbner earned his bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1942. He worked briefly for the San Francisco Chronicle as a writer, columnist and assistant financial editor. He joined the US Army in 1943, and later the Office of Strategic Services while serving, and received the Bronze Star. Gerbner was honorably discharged as a First Lieutenant. After the war he worked as a freelance writer and publicist and taught journalism at El Camino College while earning a master's (1951) and doctorate (1955) in communications at the University of Southern California. His dissertation, \\"Toward a General Theory of Communication,\\" won USC's award for \\"best dissertation.\\" He had been Dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania (1964‚Äì1989), and presided over the school's growth and influence in Communication Theory in academia. After leaving Annenberg, he became the Bell Atlantic Professor of Telecommunication at Temple University in 1997. Gerbner established the Cultural Indicators Research Project in 1968 to document trends in television content and how these changes affect viewers' perceptions of the world. He coined the phrase \\"mean world syndrome\\" to describe the fact that people who watch large amounts of television are more likely to perceive the world as a dangerous and frightening place. In the article Science on Television: How It Affects Public Conceptions, Gerbner touched on the fact that prime time television has an abundance of professionals being portrayed. Of all of the professionals, scientists seemed to be portrayed in a slightly more negative light. Scientists tended to be portrayed as ‚Äúsmarter and stronger than other professionals.\\" While these may not be bad things, they tend to be unbecoming characteristics that could shed a negative light on the entire profession. Although Gerber does mention that TV did not invent the negative perception of science, it does marginalize the field. Gerbner testified before a Congressional subcommittee on communications in 1981. He said that \\"The most general and prevalent association with television viewing is a heightened sense of living in a 'mean world' of violence and danger. Fearful people are more dependent, more easily manipulated and controlled, more susceptible to deceptively simple, strong, tough measures and hard-line postures.... They may accept and even welcome repression if it promises to relieve their insecurities. That is the deeper problem of violence-laden television.\\" He taught at Temple University, Villanova University, and the University of Pennsylvania. After leaving Penn in 1990, he founded the Cultural Environment movement, an advocacy group promoting greater diversity in communication media.https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/03/obituaries/03gerbner.html Gerbner was diagnosed with cancer in late November, 2005, and died on December 24, 2005 at his apartment in Center City, Philadelphia.

She was portrayed by Jessalyn Gilsig. Character history Gina Russo is a bitter, troubled sex addict, and is often the foil to Christian Troy. She and Christian have a love/hate sexual relationship initiated by Christian when he sleeps with her; she blames him for breaking her vow of celibacy, and holds a grudge against him for months. Gina has borderline personality disorder. She alternates between adoring Christian and calling him names. She also suffers from bulimia, and frequently engages in self- destructive behavior. =Season One= She and Christian meet at a Sexaholics Anonymous meeting, where they begin a love/hate sexual relationship initiated by Christian. She admits to having anonymous sex with multiple partners. Her Sexaholics Anonymous group calls this \\"Blackout Sex\\". At one point, Gina gets pregnant and believes the baby is Christian's, conceived from their one-night stand. This sparks a tremendous change in Christian, who decides to be the best father he can. When she gives birth, however, the baby is half black, proving that someone else is the father. Regardless, Christian decides to help Gina raise the child, whom she names Wilber. =Season Two= Obsessed with motherhood, Gina tries to have a second child by inviting a group of men over for a \\"conception party\\", in which they have group sex - the idea being that a large volume of semen from multiple partners ensures conception. When Christian finds out about this, he threatens to take sole custody of Wilber. She responds by tracking down Wilber's biological father, James Sutherland, an older married man from Arizona. James initially takes Christian's side and agrees to give up custody rights, but he later recants and wins custody of Wilber. Gina eventually reveals to Christian she is HIV-positive, which forces Christian to rethink his life. He calls every woman he had sex with since his relationship with Gina to warn them, and then tracks down James and Wilber so they could be tested - all three are HIV-negative. James convinces Christian to see the good in Gina, and he eventually forgives her. Christian ends up paying for Gina's HIV medication, as well as the rent for her apartment. =Season Three= Due to money troubles, Christian is forced to stop supporting Gina's HIV treatment, but she soon finds a way to support herself by embarking on an ambitious business venture with Julia McNamara: a surgical recovery spa called \\"De La Mer\\". Gina finds a creative way to keep down costs: she offers oral sex to contractors and construction workers in exchange for reduced fees. Julia is horrified and, for perhaps the first time, tells her she is too good to be doing such things to herself. Later, Gina becomes the final victim of The Carver, a masked serial rapist, in Miami. She later explains to Sean and Christian that she had shown up at McNamara/Troy to ask Christian to be her date. Christian had refused, saying that he did not want to ruin their friendship. =Season Four= Christian is given legal guardianship of Wilber, after James Sutherland and his wife die in a car accident. Gina returns to fight for her own rights to her child, despite the fact that James' adult son explained that his father's will explicitly stated Gina was to have nothing to do with the boy. Gina has since become a successful real estate developer, and has sold Spa De La Mer for a large profit. She therefore believes she can give Wilber the life he deserves. When Christian asks her how she intends to raise a child while having HIV, she replies that \\"HIV is the new diabetes\\". While Christian, Michelle, and Wilber are having dinner, Gina returns and tries to visit her son. When she discovers that Michelle is to be Wilber's adopted mother, she becomes enraged and swears that she will get custody of Wilber. Later in the episode, Gina kidnaps her son, but later returns him to Christian, saying that Wilber is too much for her to handle. She leaves him with Christian after giving him a toy firetruck. =Season Five= When Sean discovers that Christian and Julia are having an affair, he tries to get back at them by hiring Gina to be McNamara/Troy's new receptionist. Despite once again claiming to be reformed, Gina tries to get her claws into Christian and begins to watch him have sex with other women, before cruelly taunting Julia about his infidelity. Inviting Christian up to the McNamara/Troy roof for a candle-lit dinner, Gina tells him she wants to get back together. Christian is initially wary, but eventually they begin to have sex. Gina climbs onto the ledge as she reaches orgasm, and falls backward off the ledge to her death.

He received his Ph.D. from The University of California at Berkeley. In recent decades he has been working on surveillance issues, illustrating how and why surveillance is neither good nor bad, but context and comportment make it so. He has sought to create a conceptual map of new ways of collecting, analyzing, communicating and using personal information. Explanation and evaluation require a common language for the identification and measurement of surveillance's fundamental properties and contexts (e.g., the new surveillance, surveillance society, maximum security society, surveillance creep; surveillance slack, the softening of surveillance, the myth of surveillance, neutralization and counter- neutralization, and four basic surveillance contexts: coercion, contracts, care, and cross cutting, unprotected \\"publicly\\" available data). His work has appeared or been reprinted in over 300 books, monographs and periodicals and has been translated into Japanese, Chinese, Czech, French, Italian, Spanish, Hebrew, Dutch, German, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Greek, Turkish, Portuguese, Persian, Macedonian, Slovak, Swedish, Belorussian; and other languages. His articles have appeared in academic journals such as American Sociological Review, American Journal of Sociology, Social Problems, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, and many others. He has also written for popular sources including but not limited to Harvard Business Review, California Monthly, Computerworld, Abacus, The Nation, and The New Republic.

History Dormitory St. Ambrose Church The land on which JFK Prep was built on is the former Oschwald Foundation founded by Fr. Ambrose Oschwald in 1854. That was the year that the first settlers arrived in St. Nazianz and began clearing land and building houses. Oschwald's intent was to found a village whose members would observe the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity and obedience according to their states of life. Property was to be held in common. Each member was to work for the common good, and to receive what it needed from the common store. America was chosen as the site for this new foundation, because \\"it was impossible to build up in the native Black Forest in Baden, Germany a Catholic village and/or parish which would be essentially geared to the pursuit of Christian perfection through the obersvation (sic) of the evangelical counsels by all its members, married, single and celibate (cloistered), it was decided to go to America and stamp this enterprise out of the virgin soil of a newly opened up territory ... \\"The moment of Grace, vol. 1, Milwaukee: Society of the Divine Saviour, 1994, p. 63.

One of the greatest names in Brazilian popular music, Noel gave a new twist to samba, combining its Afro- Brazilian roots with a more urban, witty language and making it a vehicle for ironic social commentary. Early life Rosa was born in Rio de Janeiro into a middle-class family of the Vila Isabel neighbourhood. An accident with a forceps at his birth caused a disfigured chin. He learned to play the mandolin while still a teenager, and soon moved on to the guitar. Although Noel started medicine studies, he gave most of his attention to music and would spend whole nights in bars drinking and playing with other samba musicians. Career Together with Braguinha and Almirante he formed the musical group Bando de Tangar√°s. Soon he started composing sambas, and he had his breakthrough with \\"Com que roupa?\\", one of the biggest hits of 1931 and the first in a string of memorable compositions. Noel was a good friend of Cartola, who took care of him several times at his house on the Mangueira slum after some nights of heavy drinking. In the early 1930s Noel Rosa started to show signs of tuberculosis. He would occasionally leave for treatment in mountain resorts, but always ended up coming back to Rio and the nightlife. Personal life and death In 1934, Rosa married Lindaura Martins, a seventeen-year-old neighbour, but that didn't keep him from having affairs with other women. Rosa was a heavy smoker, and most of his photographs show him with a cigarette hanging from his lower lip. By the later 1930s his health had seriously deteriorated, and he died of tuberculosis in 1937 at the age of 26. It is likely that Rosa had Pierre Robin syndrome. Tribute * On December 11, 2019, Google celebrated his 109th birthday with a Google Doodle. * A tunnel in the Vila Isabel neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro is named in his honor.

This particular urinary diversion results in a continent reservoir that the patient must catheterize to empty urine. This concept and technique was developed by Drs. Mike Mitchell, Randall Rowland, and Richard Bihrle at Indiana University. Description With this type of surgery, a reservoir, or pouch, is created out of approximately two feet of the ascending colon and a portion of the ileum (a part of the small intestine). The ureters are surgically removed from the bladder and repositioned to drain into this new pouch. The end of the segment of small intestine is brought out through a small opening in the abdominal wall called a stoma. Since a segment including the large and small intestines is utilized, also included in this new system is the ileocecal valve. This is a one-way valve located between the small and large intestines. This valve normally prevents the passage of bacteria and digested matter from re-entering the small intestine. Originally, it was thought that removing the ileocecal valve from the digestive tract would likely result in diarrhea, but this has not shown to be the case. After a period of several weeks, the body adjusts to the absence of this valve (from the digestive tract) by absorbing more liquids and nutrients. Importantly, this valve, in its new capacity, will now effectively prevent the escape of urine from the stoma. The passage of the conduit through the abdominal wall allows the rectus abdominis muscle to aid with continence. =Recovery and function= The surgery itself along with recovery time depends on the patient. Robotic surgery can take approximately 6-12 hours. A patient's time in the hospital can take 7‚Äì10 days if no complications present themselves. Depending on the type of surgery the abdominal incision for this surgery may be up to eight inches in length and is typically closed with staples on the outside and several layers of dissolvable stitches on the inside. After surgery, patients will have three drainage tubes place while tissues heal: one through the newly created stoma, one through another temporary opening in the abdominal wall into the pouch, and an SP tube (to drain non-specific post- surgical abdominal fluid). In the hospital, the SP tube and external staples will be removed, after several days. The remaining two tubes will each be connected to collection bags worn on each leg and the patient is usually sent home like this. After sufficient healing, and another doctor's visit, the tube will be removed from the stoma. The patient will now begin to catheterize the pouch every two hours. Since one other tube will still be in place, patients can still sleep through the night, since a larger collection bag is attached to that tube at night time. After approximately one month, patients will return to the hospital for a special x-ray. Dye will be instilled into the pouch to verify that there is no leakage of urine. If there is no leakage, this last tube will be removed. Emptying time now may be increased to 3 hours, however, now the patient will need to wake up during the night (every 3 hours) to empty the pouch. Over time, emptying time can possibly be increased up to 4‚Äì6 hours. Although to decrease the potential for infections and deterioration of the pouch it is best to continue to cath every 3-4 hours. The pouch will continue to expand and will reach its final size at approximately six months. The pouch will then hold up to 1,200 cubic centimeters (cc). Depending on your doctor's orders, each day, the pouch may need to be irrigated with 60 cc of sterile water in an effort to remove membrane mucus, salts, and bacteria. It can take 6-12 months for your body to adjust to the Indiana pouch. =Advantages= In contrast to other urinary diversion techniques, such as the ileal conduit urinary diversion, the Indiana pouch has the advantage of not using an external pouch adhered to the abdomen to store urine as it is created inside of the body. The urine is drained through a small stoma that is barely visible. This can result in a better body image and broader clothing options. Also, there will not be the worry of an external urostomy appliance coming loose and leaking. The Indiana pouch will require sterile catheters to insert into the stoma to drain the urine every 3-4 hours. To avoid a possible fatal infection, a new sterile intermittent catheter should be used each time and not reused. As with the urostomy appliances, the cost of intermittent catheters can be significant, and both are not usually covered fully by most health insurance plans. Plus, as with the external urostomy appliance, the catheter supply will need to be monitored to see how many appliances are left before ordering more and waiting for them to be shipped. The long term financial costs to the recipient of the Indiana pouch and other urinary diversion techniques are both substantial. Although notably, the Indiana pouch is the most viable option for maintaining a lifestyle similar to prior the surgery because of the ability to move freely from fear of rupturing an external device plus the ability to continue most of the same activities. =Treatment= Indiana pouch surgery can be done in very young patients, as long as they understand how to catheterize the pouch and can empty the pouch on a schedule. Indiana pouch surgery also has been successful in patients of advanced ages, also as long as they are able to empty and irrigate the pouch on a schedule. Some patients, after having had an ileal conduit, requiring an external appliance, have opted to have the Indiana pouch, as elective surgery. Such a surgery is usually recommended, if possible, since it has been documented that the Indiana pouch may reduce the possibility of kidney damage because the ureters are repositioned lower in the abdomen. This positioning reduces the possible back-flow of urine to the kidneys. After having an Indiana pouch surgery, patients may choose to wear a medical alert medallion indicating they have an Indiana pouch. =Possible complications and side effects= Patients who have an Indiana pouch run the risk of infections from the stoma, difficult catherization, pain around the stoma, stones, and leakage. Also this type of urinary diversion causes immediate metabolic changes that can give a wide range of symptoms from diarrhea, vitamin B12 deficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, hepatic metabolism, and possible bone health deterioration. Over the lifetime of the Indiana pouch, the recipient should have their kidney function closely monitored.

Johann Georg Sulzer (; 16 October 1720 in Winterthur ‚Äì 27 February 1779 in Berlin) was a Swiss professor of Mathematics, who later on moved on to the field of electricity. He was a Wolffian philosopher and director of the philosophical section of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and translator of David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals into German in 1755. Sulzer is best known as the subject of an anecdote in the history of the development of the battery. In 1752, Sulzer happened to put the tip of his tongue between pieces of two different metals whose edges were in contact. He exclaimed, \\"a pungent sensation, reminds me of the taste of green vitriol when I placed my tongue between these metals.\\"(reference needed) He thought the metals set up a vibratory motion in their particles which excited the nerves of taste. The event became known as the \\"battery tongue test\\": - the saliva serves as the electrolyte carrying the current between two metallic electrodes. His General Theory of the Fine Arts has been called \\"probably the most influential aesthetic compendium of the closing years of the eighteenth century\\".Petra Maisak, in Pape & Burwick (Eds.), The Boydell Shakespeare Gallery, Peter Pomp 1996, , p. 59 In it, he \\"extended Baumgarten's approach into an even more psychological theory that the primary object of enjoyment in aesthetic experience is the state of one's own cognitive condition.\\"Kant, Immanuel, translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W.

Kant wrote: \\"I cannot share the opinion so frequently expressed by excellent and thoughtful men (for instance Sulzer) who, being fully conscious of the weakness of the proofs hitherto advanced, indulge in a hope that the future would supply us with evident demonstrations of the two cardinal propositions of pure reason, namely, that there is a God, and that there is a future life.

In 2005 he was recalled from his position as Alderman after supporting a controversial redevelopment proposal, using eminent domain to acquire homes to build a gas station. In March 2011, Bauer defeated incumbent 24th Ward alderman Bill Waterhouse in the Democratic primary, but lost to independent candidate Scott Ogilvie in the April general election.  Education and background  Bauer grew up in St. Louis and attended Chaminade College Preparatory School. He attended St. Louis University, graduating in 1969. He received his Juris Doctor from St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas in 1979.  Early political career  Bauer first ran for public office in 1992, seeking election to the Missouri House of Representatives. He challenged fellow Democrat Tony Ribaudo, a longtime incumbent. The district included the predominantly Italian Hill neighborhood where Ribaudo lived, as well as Bauer's Dogtown neighborhood. Ribaudo won re- election, beating Bauer by 3200 votes (4851 to 1651). In 1993, Ribaudo was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Mayor of St. Louis. A number of negative ads and mailings were run by Ribaudo and his opponents attacking one another. 1994, Bauer again challenged Ribaudo for his house seat. This time, Ribaudo beat Bauer by only 254 votes (2753 to 2499). Bauer gained notoriety for campaigning in the district with his pet donkey, Scotty. The 1994 campaign was also marked by negative campaigning on both sides. Both candidates purchased advertising on cable television and aired spots attacking the other. This level of advertising was highly unusual for a local election. In 1996, Ribaudo did not run for re-election and Bauer again ran for the State Representative seat. Bauer won the crowded Democratic primary with less than 50% of the vote, and went on to win the general election by a wide margin .  State Representative  As a member of the State Legislature, Bauer was noted for his support of legislation to preserve \\"neighborhood schools.\\" Bauer advocated a \\"Student's Bill of Rights\\" that would have required each district to allow students to attend a K-8 school in their neighborhood. Critics said that this plan would have dismantled middle schools and undermine steps that the St. Louis public schools had made to eliminate historic segregation within the public school system. In 1998, Bauer sought re-election as State Representative. The race was again dominated by the division between Bauer's base of support in the Dogtown neighborhood versus The Hill. Unlike 1996, there was only one candidate from The Hill in this election, Derio Gambaro. Gambaro defeated Bauer in the Democratic primary, 58% to 42% .  Alderman  A few months after his unsuccessful bid for re-election as State Representative, Bauer filed to run for a position on the St. Louis Board of Aldermen. As with the State Representative seat, the district included both the Hill neighborhood and the Dogtown neighborhood. The long-time incumbent from the Hill neighborhood was not seeking re-election. Two candidates from the Hill filed in the Democratic primary. Bauer was the only candidate from Dogtown. He again won the primary with less than 50% of the vote and won the general election in April 1999. Shortly after his election as Alderman, Bauer had the opportunity to participate in the redistricting of Aldermanic ward boundaries required after the 2000 Census. The redistricting resulted in the Hill neighborhood being drawn into a new ward, with Bauer's ward consisting mostly of Dogtown. In 2001 Bauer made a run for Comptroller one of the many citywide elected positions in St. Louis. He challenged the incumbent, Darlene Green, an African-American woman. As with many political campaigns in St. Louis, the voting broke down along racial lines. Bauer carried most of the predominantly white wards in South St. Louis, while Green won the election based on strong support in predominantly black North St. Louis and in the racially integrated neighborhoods in the central part of the city. In 2003, Bauer was re-elected as alderman of the re-districted ward, winning 59% of the vote in the Democratic primary and 71% of the vote in the general election . Although he had been elected to office three times, this marked the first time that Bauer had won a majority of the vote in a primary election. Bauer's pet donkey, Scotty, continued to be a fixture in his campaigns. Scotty had died by the time of the 2003 campaign, and had been replaced by a new donkey, named Dan. Although Dan accompanied Bauer on campaign stops, a drawing of a donkey labeled \\"Scotty\\" continued to be a fixture on Bauer's campaign signs and billboards. As Alderman, Bauer was a proponent of efforts to bring residential and commercial redevelopment to the neighborhoods in his ward. The community he represented was traditionally working class, and the housing mostly consisted of modest bungalows. However, the neighborhood's central location and proximity to Forest Park began attracting more middle and upper class residents. Developers began demolishing some of the older single family homes and building attached luxury townhouses. Bauer consistently supported this type of development, although it generated some controversy.  Recall  Bauer's support for redevelopment efforts generated significant controversy. Especially controversial was Bauer's occasional support of eminent domain for these projects. Opposition crystallized around a proposal to use eminent domain to acquire and demolish several homes and small businesses for a new gas station and convenience store. Several residents of the neighborhood began circulating petitions to have Bauer recalled from office. Bauer lashed out at his opponents. He filed a lawsuit against several leaders of the recall campaign. The lawsuit, which Bauer's opponents characterized as a SLAPP suit, generated further outrage. The opponents were able to gather enough signatures to trigger a recall election. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's Kelo v New London decision, eminent domain was one of the most prominent issues. In the recall election on September 20, 2005, 61% voted to remove Bauer from office. The recall created a vacancy on the Board of Aldermen, and a special election was called to fill the seat. Both the Democratic and Republican party nominated candidates for the seat. Bauer also collected petition signatures and filed to run as an independent. The campaign was again marked by negative campaigning. Bauer ran newspaper and cable television advertising attacking his Democratic opponent for failing to pay his property taxes on time, and noting an arrest for failure to pay a traffic ticket. As in his past campaigns Bauer's pet donkey Scotty appeared on his campaign signs, along with the label \\"Independent Democrat\\". Since Bauer was not the Democratic nominee, the city's Democratic party, led by chairman Brian Wahby sued to prevent him from using the term \\"Democrat\\" or the Democratic symbol of the donkey in his campaign literature. About a week before the election, a settlement was reached allowing Bauer to continue to use the donkey, but requiring him to remove the word \\"Democrat\\" from any of his campaign materials. The special election was held on December 13, 2005. Bill Waterhouse, the Democratic nominee, was elected with 51% of the vote. Bauer received 26.7% of the vote, and the Republican candidate received 22.3%. Bauer again challenged Waterhouse in the Democratic Primary of 2007. In the March 6, 2007, Primary Election, Waterhouse handily beat Bauer with nearly 58 percent of the vote in a two-way race .

Lacking space for expansion, the company was purchased by Henry J. Kaiser in 1951. Plans to produce the C-123 transport for the United States Air Force collapsed amid scandal, and the company closed in 1953. A successor company, Stroukoff Aircraft, continued experimental work for several years before closing in 1959. Early products Founded in New York, New York in 1943 with Michael Stroukoff, a Russian √©migr√©, as president and chief designer,Gunston 1987, p.146. Chase's first aircraft design was the XCG-14 assault glider, produced for the U.S. Army Air Forces and first flying in January 1945.Jane 1951, p.214 Development of improved, enlarged versions of the aircraft continued over the next two years, with the company moving to Trenton, New Jersey in 1946,Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences, 1948. Aeronautical Engineering Review, Volume 7, p.9 before the XCG-14 was superseded by the XG-18, an even larger and heavier aircraftMitchell 1992, p.164. that was the world's first all-metal transport glider.World Aircraft Information Files, File 891 Sheet 26. London: Bright Star Publishing. Chase YC-122 By 1949, the United States Air Force had determined that the glider was no longer a viable weapon on the battlefield, and the XG-18 was modified, being fitted with a pair of radial engines. Redesignated as the YC-122 Avitruc, three prototype and one pre-production aircraft were produced, and despite favorable evaluations, the Air Force had reconsidered its requirement for small transports, and decided not to proceed with full production of the design. One YC-122, however, would later be modified into the Hiller X-18, an experimental tiltwing VTOL aircraft.Kuhn 1960, p.259. XG-20 and the first jet transport Meanwhile, a third, still larger, assault glider had been designed by Stroukoff, the XG-20, the largest glider ever built in the United States and also the last combat glider to be constructed for the U.S. military.Sergievsky et al. 1998, p.128 By the time the XG-20 was ready for flight testing, gliders had been determined to be obsolete as weapons of war, and so the two aircraft were taken aside for modification. The first prototype XG-20 was fitted with twin radial engines of a larger, more powerful type than those fitted to the YC-122, and was redesignated the XC-123.Andrade 1979, p. 87. The second prototype XG-20, following public display in early 1950 at Pope AFB during Exercise Swarmer,Shrader 1953, p.136. was taken aside for a more radical transformation, being fitted with two twin bomber engine pods containing J47 turbojets, and flying in early 1951 as the XC-123A, the United States' first jet-powered transport aircraft.Pattillo 2000, pp.165-166. Kaiser and the pricing scandal Henry J. Kaiser While the XC-123A proved too uneconomical for production, the XC-123 had greatly impressed the Air Force, which issued an order for five pre-production aircraft, designated C-123B. The prospect of large follow-up orders, however, raised an issue of capacity, as Chase's factory lacked sufficient space to construct large numbers of aircraft. Therefore, in 1951, 49 percent of Chase was purchased by Kaiser-Frazer, who received a contract for 300 C-123B aircraft to be constructed at Kaiser's Willow Run factory in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Chase became an engineering shop for the company, with Stroukoff remaining with the facility as its chief engineer. However, even as the first eight aircraft were under construction by Kaiser, the United States Senate was conducting a series of hearings regarding the company, concerns having been raised over subcontracting work Kaiser-Frazer was performing for Fairchild Aircraft.Life July 6, 1953, p.22 Kaiser had been awarded an earlier contract as a second source for construction of Fairchild's C-119, and the aircraft produced by Kaiser were proving to be significantly more expensive than those produced by Fairchild. The result of the hearings was the cancellation of Kaiser's contracts for both the C-119 and the C-123 in June 1953, despite the Air Force having already spent $30 million USD on preparation for production of the C-123, with another $40 million having been earmarked for use by Chase Aircraft directly for production of parts.AVIATION: The Ax for Willow Run. Time Magazine, Jul. 06, 1953 The C-123 contract was put out for re-bid, with Fairchild proving to be the winning contractor;Gunston 1977, p. 164. under Fairchild's name, the C-123 went on to see a large production run and extensive service in the Vietnam War.Adcock 1992, pp.8-21 Dissolution Kaiser-Frazer, meanwhile, had bought out the remaining 51% of Chase Aircraft's shares, intending to operate the company as a wholly owned subsidiary of Willys Motors; the sale closed on September 2, 1953, after the cancellation of the Air Force's contracts.Ward's automotive yearbook, Volume 16 (1954), p.121. Without the C-123 contract, the new acquisition was no longer considered an asset by Kaiser-Frazer; and it announced that the company would be closed down on January 31, 1954.\\"Kaiser To Close Chase Plant In New Jersey\\". American Aviation, Volume 17 (1953), p.15. Stroukoff, however, acquired the buildings and remaining assets of Chase, starting his own aircraft company, Stroukoff Aircraft, to conduct further work on experimental versions of the C-123.

This can be due to decreased production in the liver, increased loss in the gastrointestinal tract or kidneys, increased use in the body, or abnormal distribution between body compartments. Patients often present with hypoalbuminemia as a result of another disease process such as sepsis, cirrhosis in the liver, nephrotic syndrome in the kidneys, or protein-losing enteropathy in the gastrointestinal tract. One of the roles of albumin is being the major driver of oncotic pressure (protein concentration within the blood) in the bloodstream and the body. Thus, hypoalbuminemia leads to abnormal distributions of fluids within the body and its compartments. As a result, associated symptoms include edema in the lower legs, ascites in the abdomen, and effusions around internal organs. Laboratory tests aimed at assessing liver function diagnose hypoalbuminemia. Once identified, it is a poor prognostic indicator for patients with a variety of different diseases. Yet, it is only treated in very specific indications in patients with cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome. Treatment instead focuses on the underlying cause of the hypoalbuminemia. Albumin is an acute negative phase respondent and NOT a reliable indicator of nutrition status.  Signs and symptoms  Pitting edema of the lower extremities commonly seen in conditions associated hypoalbuminemia. Patients with hypoalbuminemia are more likely to present with it as a sign of an underlying disease process than as a primary disease process. By itself, hypoalbuminemia decreases the total protein concentration in blood plasma, also known as the colloid osmotic pressure, which causes fluid to exit the blood vessels into tissues to equalize the concentrations. This leads to fluid-induced swelling of the extremities known as edema, build- up of fluid in the abdomen known as ascites, and fluid surrounding internal organs known as effusions. Patients also present with nonspecific findings such as fatigue and excessive weakness. Muehrcke's lines are a strong indicator of hypoalbuminemia. Hypoalbuminemia by itself may present without any symptoms, as the congenital and complete loss of albumin seen in analbuminemia can be asymptomatic. Alternatively, it can present with death in utero prior to birth or as a disease of adults characterized by edema, fatigue, and hyperlipidemia. The reason for this heterogeneity of presentation is not well understood. = Complications = By itself, hypoalbuminemia can cause hypovolemia and circulatory collapse secondary to decreased oncotic pressure within the vascular system. Due to its metal-binding properties, hypoalbuminemia may lead to nutritional deficits including zinc deficiency. Hypoalbuminemia associated with the nephrotic syndrome can lead to the development of hyperlipidemia, although this is usually in the absence of atherosclerosis. Further, in patients on dialysis, hypoalbuminemia is associated with more advanced fluid overload.  Causes  Hypoalbuminemia can be caused through a number of different mechanisms, each with the end result of decreasing albumin levels. These include: 1) impaired synthesis within the liver, 2) increased utilization by tissue, 3) distributional issues, and 4) increased excretion or loss. Often, the cause is multifactorial as in liver cirrhosis, where reduced hepatic synthesis and increased capillary leakage combine to further decrease albumin levels. = Inflammation and infection = Albumin is considered a negative acute phase reactant, which means that as inflammation and other acute physiologic processes occur, its levels decrease. This is in contrast to acute phase reactants like C-reactive protein (CRP), whose levels increase with inflammatory processes. With respect to mechanism, inflammation leads to decreased production of albumin as a result of increased levels of cytokines, specifically IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-Œ±. In patients with the overwhelming infections common in sepsis and septic shock, hypoalbuminemia occurs as a result of the combinatorial effects of decreased synthesis as above, increased utilization by tissues, and increased transcapillary leakage from blood vessels due to increased vascular permeability. = Liver disease = Healthy and cirrhotic liver. If present, hypoalbuminemia suggests advanced liver disease as seen in cirrhosis. Albumin is synthesized in the liver, and low serum albumin can be indicative of liver failure or diseases such as cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis. If present, hypoalbuminemia is generally considered to be a sign of advanced hepatic cirrhosis, or irreversible damage to the liver. Production of albumin can be one 60‚Äì80% lower in advanced cirrhosis than in healthy liver, an effect amplified by dilution (salt and water retention), fluid shifts (following the accumulation of albumin in extracellular space and ascitic fluid), and even post-transcriptional changes to albumin itself. = Kidney disease = Kidney biopsy showing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, one of the causes of nephrotic syndrome commonly seen in children.Hypoalbuminemia can also present as part of the nephrotic syndrome, in which significant quantities of protein are lost in the urine due to kidney damage. Under normal conditions, less than 30 milligrams per day of albumin are lost via the glomerulus. In nephrotic syndrome, protein loss can be as great as 3.5 grams over 24 hours, much of which is albumin, itself leading to hypoalbuminemia. In children, nephrotic syndrome is commonly a primary disease process that is largely idiopathic, although more genetic causes are being identified with the cost and accessibility of whole exome sequencing. After renal biopsy, these syndromes are commonly diagnosed as minimal change disease, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. In adults, on the other hand, nephrotic syndrome is commonly a secondary disease process due to a variety of inciting factors. These inciting factors can be diverse, including toxins, drugs, heavy metals, autoantibodies, post-infectious antibody complexes, or immune complexes formed after malignancies like multiple myeloma. Albuminuria and resultant hypoalbuminemia can also occur in chronic kidney disease without protein loss levels as high as seen in nephrotic syndrome. Here, albumin loss from the kidneys occur due to decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and subsequent loss of 30 to 300 milligrams of albumin per day. Over the course of months, this can lead to hypoalbuminemia, a common feature of end stage renal disease. Alterations in fluid distribution and the presence of ongoing inflammation in chronic kidney disease in combination with hypoalbuminemia make fluid status control especially difficult. = Malnutrition or malabsorption = A girl with the physical signs and symptoms of Kwashiorkor, which is an extreme form of malnutrition-associated hypoalbuminemia. Kwashiorkor is a disease of malnutrition characterized by decreased protein intake and amino acid deficiency resulting in hypoalbuminemia and a characteristic physical presentation. This is an extreme example of how malnutrition can result in hypoalbuminemia. More typical is malnutrition-associated hypoalbuminemia in the elderly, who appear thin and frail but not with the rounded abdomen and edema seen in Kwashiorkor. Albumin is an acute negative phase respondent and not a reliable indicator of nutrition status Low albumin levels can also indicate chronic malnutrition from protein losing enteropathy. This is often caused or exacerbated by ulcerative colitis, but can also be seen in cardiac disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. Broadly, protein-losing enteropathy can be caused by increased lymphatic pressure in the gastrointestinal tract as in lymphangiectasis, mucosal erosion-induced lack of absorption as in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and other diseases of malabsorption without mucosal erosions as in Celiac disease. Eosinophilic gastritis presents with epigastric pain, peripheral blood eosinophilia, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia.  Pathophysiology  The liver produces albumin and then secretes into the bloodstream, where it is then distributed into tissues across the body. In the liver, the liver synthesizes albumin as pre-proalbumin, converts it first into proalbumin and then albumin in hepatocytes, and releases it into the blood. The body synthesizes albumin at a rate of 10 to 15 grams per day. In the presence of hypoalbuminemia, the liver can increase production by as much as four times the baseline production rate. Once released, albumin distributes itself between the intravascular space (40%) in blood vessels, and extravascular spaces (60%) within the body's different tissues. In the blood plasma, albumin makes up 55 to 60% of total plasma protein by mass, with globulins making up a large part of the rest. In hypoalbuminemia, the amount of albumin in the intravascular space or blood plasma is what is being measured, meaning that abnormal distribution within the two compartments may contribute to a relative hypoalbuminemia in the bloodstream with a normal level in the whole body. Once released into the body, albumin performs a number of functions that can be negatively affected by the reduced levels seen in hypoalbuminemia. These functions include regulation of colloid osmotic pressure or protein concentration within the blood plasma, transport of free fatty acids and other molecules to the liver (unconjugated bilirubin, metals, ions) for storage or utilization, binding of drugs and alteration of pharmacokinetics (half-life, biological activity levels, metabolism), buffering plasma pH, scavenging reactive oxygen species to avoid inflammation and associated damage, functioning as a reservoir of nitric oxide for the regulation of blood pressure, and prevention of coagulation and platelet aggregation in an action similar to the commonly used anticoagulant heparin. It also inhibits inflammatory mediators such as TNF-Œ± and complement 5a (C5a) to reduce the overall inflammatory response. A number of hormones (e.g. thyroxine, cortisol, testosterone), drugs, and other molecules are bound to albumin in the bloodstream and must be released from albumin before becoming biologically active. For example, calcium binds to albumin; in hypoalbuminemia, there is an increased amount of free ionized calcium, its biologically active form. In the presence of hypoalbuminemia, these functions are differentially affected, and the mechanisms by which they affect disease outcomes remains an area of active debate.  Diagnosis  The serum albumin level is part of a standard panel of liver function tests (LFT) that also includes levels of plasma protein, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). This is commonly ordered when liver disease is suspected as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) in conjunction with the electrolyte panel known as the basic metabolic panel (BMP). In kidney disease, a CMP may be ordered as a follow-up test when proteinuria is detected by urine dipstick analysis, which may lead to a diagnosis of hypoalbuminemia. Low levels of serum albumin are defined as less than 3.5 grams per deciliter, while clinically significant hypoalbuminemia is generally considered to be less than 2.5 grams per deciliter. Upon discovery of hypoalbuminemia, a common work-up will include liver function tests to assess for liver disease, urine albumin and protein levels to assess for albuminuria and nephrotic syndrome, and brain natriuretic peptide to assess for cardiac failure. If protein-losing enteropathy is suspected based on clinical suspicion, an alpha-1 antitrypsin test can be performed. If stool alpha-1 antitrypsin is elevated, this suggests excessive gastrointestinal protein loss.  Management  Treatment of hypoalbuminemia is largely focused on the underlying cause and not on the hypoalbuminemia itself. Albumin infusions can and are commonly performed although they are expensive and have not been shown to be more effective than colloid solutions in a number of conditions and situations. Examples of indications for albumin infusion include hypoalbuminemia in the context of major surgery such as hepatic resection >40%, nephrotic syndrome in conjunction with diuretics and corticosteroids, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in combination with antibiotics, and rapidly progressing hepatorenal syndrome (type 1) in combination with terlipressin. It is also used to prevent iatrogenic hypoalbuminemia after therapeutic plasmapheresis if volume plasma exchange is greater than 20 milliliters per kilogram in one session or over one week across multiple sessions and after large volume (>5 liter) paracentesis in ascites. These indications have shown positive outcomes respective to their diseases, while conditions like malnourishment, burns (during the first 24 hours), and shock with traumatic brain injury either show no benefit or harm in randomized controlled trials. In liver disease and cirrhosis, in addition to the above indications, the use of albumin is being considered for bacterial infections other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, and chronic ascites. Its use in these indications remains controversial. In kidney disease and nephrotic syndrome, albumin infusions as replacement for albumin loss to proteinuria is used in some cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome.  Prognosis  By itself, low albumin levels are associated with increased mortality rate in the general population. In disease states specifically, hypoalbuminemia has been used a predictive factor for poor outcomes in a number of conditions, including periprosthetic joint infection treatment failure, and cirrhosis. Amongst patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), hypoalbuminemia is specifically associated with ICU-acquired muscle weakness. In chronic kidney disease, hypoalbuminemia is an indicator of frailty, which is itself associated with complications, mental distress, quality of life impairment, resource utilization, and mortality.  Epidemiology  Hypoalbuminemia is commonly found in hospitalized patients, patients in the ICU, and the elderly within the hospital and the community. Amongst elderly patients, prevalence can be as high as 70%.

Biography =Early years= Jo√£o Rubinato was the seventh child of Francesco (Fernando) Rubinato and Emma Ricchini, Italian immigrants from Cavarzere (province of Venice). His parents had settled in Valinhos, a rural town in the state of S√£o Paulo, about 70 km from the city of S√£o Paulo. In 2010, two bridges were named after Rubinato: one located in Valinhos, Brazil, where the singer was born, and another in Cavarzere, Italy, where his parents came from.Delega√ß√£o oficial He is said to have been a rather reluctant student, and started working at an early age (which required falsifying his birth date). His first job was a sweeper boy and general helper at a railway company in the nearby town of Jundia√≠. In 1924 he moved to Santo Andr√©, a town in the Greater S√£o Paulo area, where he went through many jobs ‚Äî loom operator, painter, plumber, iron worker, peddler and waiter. At a local technical school (the Liceu de Artes e Of√≠cios) he learned the office of mechanical assistant. =Debut as composer and singer= In 1933 Jo√£o Rubinato moved to the city of S√£o Paulo, where he started composing songs and tried his luck as a singer in Cruzeiro do Sul radio station, in a talent- scouting show directed by Jorge Amaral. After many failures, he finally succeeded with the Noel Rosa's samba Filosofia, and got a contract for a weekly 15-minute show. Fearful that a samba artist with an Italian surname would not be taken seriously by the public, Jo√£o Rubinato then decided to adopt a more Brazilian-sounding name. So he borrowed the unusual \\"Adoniran\\" from one of his friends, and \\"Barbosa\\" from samba composer Luiz Barbosa, his idol. In 1935 he won a Carnaval song contest sponsored by the city of S√£o Paulo, with the samba Dona Boa, composed together with J. Aimber√™. Spirited by that success, he married his longtime girlfriend Olga. The couple had a daughter, Maria Helena, but the marriage broke up in less than one year. =At the R√°dio record= In 1941 he started performing comedy in the radio theater programs of the S√£o Paulo radio station R√°dio Record, ‚Äî which would later become one of the top television and radio networks of Brazil ‚Äî Rede Record. He remained with that network until his retirement in 1972; giving his voice to various popular characters created together with writer Osvaldo Moles, like: Pernafina, Z√© Cunversa, and Jean Rubinet (a parody of a French movie star). He also played parts in the movies: Pif-Paf (1945) and Ca√≠dos do C√©u (\\"Fallen from Heaven\\") (1946), both directed by Ademar Gonzaga. In 1949 he married Matilde de Lutiis, who would be his companion and co-author for the next 50 years. In 1953 he made a fine performance in the movie O Cangaceiro, by director Lima Barreto. In the early 1950s he wrote many songs on typical S√£o Paulo themes, most of them recorded by the band Dem√¥nios da Garoa, and won two other S√£o Paulo Carnaval contests. In 1955 he introduced the enormously popular character Charutinho (\\"Short Cigar\\") in the radio humor show Hist√≥rias das Malocas (\\"Shantytown Stories\\"). Adoniran also acted in some of the earliest Brazilian soap operas (telenovelas), such as A Pens√£o de D. Isaura (\\"Ms. Isaura's Boarding Home\\"), and comic programs like Cear√° contra 007 (\\"Cear√° against 007\\") and Papai Sabe Nada (\\"Daddy Knows Nothing\\"). =Later years and legacy= In spite of the success of his songs and radio characters, Adoniran only became a star of sorts after 1973 when he recorded his first own album. That made him respected as a major composer, and gave him some media exposure. Nevertheless, through his career he continued living a simple and happy life. He had earned a private table at the Bar Brahma, one of the city's most traditional bars. While he never lost his love of S√£o Paulo, towards the end of his life he became increasingly sad about the disappearance of its traditional character. \\"Until the 1960s,\\" he once said, \\"S√£o Paulo still existed, but since then I have been looking for it, and could not find it. Br√°s, where is Br√°s now? And Bexiga, where is it? I was told to look for the S√©. Could not find it. All I see is cars and concrete.\\" While his music continued to be played, Adoniran himself was gradually forgotten by the public; so that when he died in 1982, in relative poverty, he had at his side only his wife and a brother in law. However, almost 30 years after his death he is still remembered by popular Brazilian singers like Perci Guzzo, who occasionally performs his songs in tribute. On 6 August 2016, Google Doodle commemorated his 105th birthday. Homages Besides the Museu Adoniran Barbosa (at Rua XV de Novembro, 347), there are many mementos of the composer scattered through S√£o Paulo. He gave his name to a school in Itaquera, to a street in the borough of Bexiga, to a Bar Adoniran Barbosa, and to a square. In the Don Orione Square there is a bust of the artist, and in Ja√ßan√£ there is a street called \\"Rua Trem das Onze (11 PM Train Street)\\". Musical production =Themes= Adoniran Barbosa made good on the hardships of his youth by becoming the composer of the lower classes of S√£o Paulo, particularly the poor Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bexiga (Bela Vista) and Br√°s, and the poor who lived in the city's many malocas (the shanties of favelas) and corti√ßos (degraded multifamily row houses). The themes of his songs are drawn from the life of low-wage urban workers, the unemployed and the vagabonds. His first big hit was Saudosa Maloca (\\"Shanty of Fond Memories\\", 1951), where three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His next success Joga a Chave (\\"Throw me the Doorkey\\", 1952) was inspired on his own frequent experiences of arriving late at home and finding the door locked by his wife, Matilde. In his Trem das Onze (\\"The 11 pm Train\\", 1964), which has been ranked one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the Ja√ßan√£ suburb, and besides his mother will not sleep before he arrives. =Adoniran's language= Unlike the samba songs of the previous decades, which generally used the formal Portuguese of the educated class, Adoniran's lyrics are a realistic record of the informal speech of S√£o Paulo's lower classes. He once said \\"I only write samba for the common people. That is why I write lyrics in 'wrong' Portuguese, because that is how the common people speak. Besides, I feel that samba is more beautiful when sung that way\\". The homeless narrator of his Saudosa Maloca, for example, tells of the day when his shanty was torn down by the landowner: { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -----  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  Peguemo todas nossas coisa,  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  \\"We picked up all our belongings -----  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  E fumo pro meio da rua  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  And we went out on the street -----  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  Apreci√° a demoli√ß√£o.  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  To watch the demolition. -----  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  Ai, que tristeza que n√≥s sentia,  style=\\"padding- left:3em\\"  Ah, what a sorrow we felt, -----  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  Cada tauba que ca√≠a  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  Each plank as it fell -----  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  Do√≠a no cora√ß√£o...  style=\\"padding-left:3em\\"  Hurt us in the heart...\\"http://www.mp3lyrics.org/a/adoniran-barbosa/saudosa- maloca/Rodolfo Ilari, \\"Introdu√ß√£o ao estudo do l√©xico: brincando com as palavras\\", Contexto, 2002. } The peguemo instead of pegamos, fumo instead of fomos, n√≥s sentia instead of n√≥s sent√≠amos, and tauba instead of t√°bua were all standard features of the speech of many paulistas. Yet, because of the strong social prejudice attached to such \\"bad\\" Portuguese, few if any authors before Adoniran had dared to put those \\"errors\\" in writing. Even lyrics ostensibly sung by poor favela dwellers, such as the classic samba Ch√£o de Estrelas (\\"Starry Floor\\"), were paragons of correct grammar and pronunciation. Thus Adoniran's use of \\"real\\" Brazilian Portuguese was a revolution that may be comparable to Gershwin's use of Gullah in Porgy and Bess. Indeed, he was often strongly criticized for it, even by poet and composer Vin√≠cius de Moraes (of The Girl from Ipanema fame). But Adoniran did not mind his critics, and his mastery allowed him to break with convention: as he used to say, art was required to sing in \\"wrong\\" language. And the success of his most popular songs, such as Tiro ao √Ålvaro (1960), was undoubtedly due in good part to the warmth and naturalness of its language. Barbosa was known as the composer to the lower classes of S√£o Paulo, particularly the poor Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bexiga (Bela Vista) and Br√°s, as well as the poor who lived in the city's many shanties and corti√ßos (degraded multifamily row houses). He knew well the Italian-Portuguese pidgin spoken in the streets of S√£o Paulo, mostly in the sections of Mooca, Br√°s and Bexiga. In 1965, Barbosa wrote \\"Samba Italiano\\" (Italian Samba), a song that has Brazilian rhythm and theme, but Italian lyrics with some words with Brazilian influence. { cellspacing=7 - valign=top  Original in Barbosa's Italian Gioconda, piccina mia, Va' a brincare nel mare, nel fondo, Ma attenzione col tubarone, lo hai visto? Hai capito, mio San Benedito? Piove, piove, Da tempo che piove qua, Gigi, E io, sempre io, Sotto la tua finestra E voi, senza me sentire Ridere, ridere, ridere Di questo infelice qui Ti ricordi, Gioconda, Di quella sera in Guaruj√° Quando il mare ti portava via E mi chiamasti Aiuto, Marcello!

Your Gioconda is afraid of this wave } =Musical style= His favorite musical style is the samba paulista, the samba of S√£o Paulo, generally despised by the sambistas of Rio de Janeiro. A feature of this style is the samba de breque (\\"brake samba\\"), where the music is suddenly interrupted to make space for a few spoken words, or a sudden reversal in the melodic line. For example, one of his great successes, the \\"Samba do Arnesto\\" (\\"Arnest's Samba\\", 1953) begins: :O Arnesto nus convidou prum samba, ele mora no Br√°s. :\\"Arnest invited us for a samba, he lives in Br√°s.\\" The melodic line is suspended briefly for the phrase ele mora no Br√°s, which marks it as a parenthetical remark ‚Äì not only in the lyrics, but in the music as well.

He is portrayed by Tom Cruise in all films to date. Appearances =Mission: Impossible (1996)= In the first film, Hunt acts as the IMF point man for an experienced field team led by veteran Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), his mentor. While attempting to recover stolen files containing information on all IMF's field agents during a mission in Prague, the entire team, barring Hunt, is supposedly killed and the files are stolen, leaving Hunt the only suspect as he learns that the mission was a set-up to expose a mole who had been selling secrets to a Czech arms dealer (Vanessa Redgrave). Hunt decides to steal the genuine list himself, demanding that the genuine mole be present at the exchange. He sets up a rogue team of other disavowed agents, including computer expert Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), and Jim's wife Claire (Emmanuelle B√©art), who had in fact survived the mission and chooses to help Ethan clear his name. Ethan later finds Jim alive and deduces that he is the real mole, working with Claire and Krieger; Jim chose to betray the IMF due to his disillusionment with the end of the Cold War. He, Claire, and Krieger intend to escape with the money for the list and frame Ethan for their crimes. Ethan works out their true agenda when Jim attempts to accuse IMF head Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) of being the mole, allowing Ethan to expose their survival to Kittridge. In a final confrontation in the Channel Tunnel, Claire is killed when she tries to protect Ethan in a moment of conscience, and Ethan avenges the rest of the team when he kills Jim and Krieger by destroying their escape helicopter with explosive chewing gum from the Prague mission. Ethan gets Luther reinstated as an IMF agent and considers leaving the IMF, but is offered a mission of his own during the flight home. =Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)= In the second film, Hunt is tasked with retrieving a deadly genetically engineered virus, known as \\"Chimera\\", from a rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who intends to release the virus after acquiring a controlling influence on the company that created it so that he can profit from sales of the cure. Hunt attempts to infiltrate Ambrose's inner circle through Ambrose's former girlfriend, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), an accomplished thief. During their mission, Hunt and Nordoff-Hall engage in an affair that complicates the mission. At the climax, Nordoff-Hall is forced to infect herself with the last virus in order to save Hunt; with Hunt having destroyed the only other traces of the virus, she was thus able to shield Hunt until he could escape. Subsequently racing against time‚Äîthe virus is incurable twenty hours after infection‚ÄîHunt manages to acquire the cure and is forced to kill Ambrose. =Mission: Impossible III (2006)= In the third film, Hunt is now a semi-retired training officer for IMF and plans a quiet life with his fianc√©e Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), who does not know about the IMF. He is called back into service to rescue a former student called Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) captured during a mission in Germany, and recovers confidential information via stolen laptop. He is forced to once again go rogue in an attempt to track down the sadistic arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and secure a dangerous mystery item known as the 'Rabbit's Foot'. After an impromptu ceremony, Hunt and Julia are married, only for Owen, who has a double agent working within IMF, to kidnap Julia. With the help of his IMF team: Stickell, Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), and Zhen Lei (Maggie Q), Hunt finds the Rabbit's foot, saves his wife, and kills Owen Davian in Shanghai. The later film Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout confirms that Ethan and Julia were happy for a while, but their marriage was tainted every time they heard a disaster due to the possibility that Ethan could have done something to stop it. =Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Ghost Protocol (2011)= In the fourth film, Hunt--having just escaped from a deep-cover mission in prison-- and his IMF team are blamed for an attack that destroys the Kremlin, resulting in the disavowal of the entire IMF. Despite lacking their usual resources, connections, technology, and backup, their mission is to find and stop Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), a former Soviet nuclear strategist who is intent on starting a nuclear war to usher in the next era of human evolution. As they chase Hendricks to Dubai and on to Mumbai, India, they themselves are pursued by a team of Russian agents trying to apprehend them. The team becomes increasingly fractured as individual members fight their own demons while trying to trust the others. Hunt manages to pull the team together, stop a nuclear bomb and clear the IMF of any involvement in the Kremlin attack. It is also revealed that Hunt had Julia's death faked to protect her, something only he and the Secretary of IMF knew about, giving him the pretext to infiltrate the prison his team freed him from in the opening scenes. =Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation (2015)= In the fifth film, Hunt is assigned a mission that culminates in him hanging outside of an A400M military aircraft 5,000 feet above the ground in Belarus to recover a package that contains VX nerve gas. Although this mission succeeds, when he learns that the thieves responsible for stealing the gas lacked the connections to do so, Hunt begins to uncover evidence of the existence of the Syndicate, a consortium of covert operatives who wreak terrorist attacks worldwide. After Hunt is forced to go off-the-grid when he is nearly killed by a Syndicate operative and the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA due to its controversial and destructive methods, he spends six months trying to track the Syndicate. Eventually, he and his former team learn that the Syndicate was actually originally a British project to perform missions without oversight, but British agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) took the plans and went rogue, now seeking to steal files that would grant him access to various established bank accounts to finance future Syndicate operations. Refusing to allow the Syndicate to continue, Hunt and his team are able to capture Lane, with CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) subsequently forced to claim that the disbanding of IMF was a cover to allow them to track the Syndicate. =Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout (2018)= In the sixth film, an IMF mission goes wrong when Ethan chooses to save Luther after his friend is taken hostage, allowing a splinter group of the Syndicate, known as the Apostles, to gain access to three plutonium cores that could be used to create nuclear weapons. Forced to work with CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), Ethan is able to assume the identity of Apostle contact John Lark (Liang Yang) and acquire one of the cores in exchange for breaking Solomon Lane out of prison ‚Äì despite opposition from Ilsa Faust, now under orders to kill Lane or bring him back to Britain ‚Äì but he, Luther and Benji later use Lane to trick Walker into revealing that he is Lark. When the Secretary is killed by Walker, Ethan's team and Ilsa track Walker and Lane to a medical aid camp where Julia, Ethan's estranged wife, is currently working, Ethan realizing that Lane and Walker intend to detonate the bombs there for both the personal reason of hurting Ethan and the wider-scale reason that such a nuclear detonation would contaminate the water supply for almost a third of the world's population. While Luther, Julia, Benji and Ilsa disable the bombs and confront Lane, Ethan is forced to steal a helicopter that he doesn't know how to fly to pursue Walker and acquire the bomb detonator, culminating in a desperate struggle on a steep cliff that ends with Walker forced off the cliff. With the crisis concluded, Ethan's reputation and the reputation of the IMF is redeemed in the eyes of the CIA, who muse that Ethan's focus on individual lives is important for his superiors as it allows them to focus on the biggest picture. =Video games= Aside from the Mission: Impossible films, Ethan Hunt has appeared in the 1998 video game based on the first film and the 2003 video game Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Operation Surma, voiced by Steve Blum. He also appears as a playable character in the crossover game Lego Dimensions, with archive recordings of Tom Cruise being used for his voice. Reception As of March 2020, Hunt was voted #31 on Ranker's \\"The Most Hardcore Big Screen Action Heroes\\".https://m.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/the- most-badass-big-screen-action-heroes Vlad Dima, writing in Bright Lights Film Journal, said while the series succeeds due to \\"inventive, over-the-top stunts, the relentless trickery, and ultimately... Tom Cruise's star-power\\", he said, \\"One less obvious element, though, is a myth that slowly develops over the span of the series and comes to full bloom in Fallout... [is Ethan] Hunt's eternal quest... to become the perfect man.\\" Dima said Ethan Hunt \\"comes from a long line of action heroes\\" and that the character (and the films) have become more like James Bond and Jason Bourne. Hunt \\"erases all of the weaknesses we have ever noticed in any of these screen heroes\\". He is unlike Bourne in knowing his status as \\"a good guy\\" and unlike Bond in not womanizing, having cared about only two women. Dima said, \\"This personal detail seems to be an important requirement in the mythology of the perfect man.\\" References Category:Action film characters Category:Fictional American secret agents Category:Mission: Impossible characters Category:Spy film characters Category:Tom Cruise Category:Film characters introduced in 1996 ","title":"Ethan Hunt"},{"id":"3420386","text":"The Simple Mail Access Protocol (SMAP) is an application layer Internet protocol for accessing e-mail stored on a server.

He was born in Innsbruck, the son of the composer Reinhard Schwarz-Schilling and is married to the author Marie-Luise Schwarz-Schilling with whom he has two children. Professional career In 1950, Schwarz-Schilling got his Abitur at the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt Gymnasium in Berlin. He continued to study History and East Asian Languages and Culture at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. In 1956 he was granted a Ph.D. for his thesis on Chinese History, \\"Der Friede von Shan-Y√ºan 1005 n. Chr. und seine Auswirkungen auf die Beziehungen zwischen dem Chinesischen Reich und dem Liao-Reich der Kitan\\" (The Peace of Shan Yuan 1005 AD, and its Effects on the Relations between the Chinese Empire and the Liao-Empire of Kitan). In 1957, he became manager of the battery manufacturer Accumulatorenfabrik Sonnenschein in B√ºdingen in Hesse, which he remained until 1982. 1993-2002 he was CEO of Dr. Schwarz-Schilling & Partner GmbH, his own telecommunications consultancy in B√ºdingen. In 1971, he became a member of the Television Council of the ZDF, one of Germany's two public service TV stations, which he left in 1982. Between 1975 and 1983 he was chairman of the coordination council for Media Politics of the CDU/CSU. Political career During this period he began to form an interest in regional politics, joining the Christian Democratic Union in 1960. In 1964, he joined the regional board of the CDU in Hesse. In 1966, Schwarz-Schilling was elected into the regional parliament of Hesse and in 1967 he became the general secretary of the CDU in Hesse. Since 1971, Schwarz-Schilling became involved in national politics, becoming member of several councils. In 1976 Schwarz-Schilling was elected into the Bundestag and remained a member until 2002. During this time he served as the vice-chairman of the Small Business Union of the CDU/CSU between 1977 and 1997. In 1979, he became president of the Executive Bureau of the European Small Business Union, which he left in 1982. Between 1981 and 1982, he was chairperson of the Research Committee on New Information and Communication Technology of the Bundestag furthering innovative communications technology. In 1982, he was appointed Federal Minister for Post and Communication, in the first Kohl cabinet.http://www.cducsu.de/Titel__drphil___________________christian____________________schwarz_schilling/TabID__23/SubTabID__27/InhaltID__2/AbgID__104/abgeordnetearchiv.aspx Before his appointment, he was He retained his post for the next three cabinets Kohl, Schwarz-Schilling was never part of Kohl's inner circle and is, by some, regarded as unremarkable minister. Others see him as cabinet minister who pursued a long-term strategy of modernisation and actually got things done. Under his ministry cable television was introduced in Germany and commercial television was allowed to broadcast. Deutsche Post was privatised, including its Telecom business. Schwarz-Schilling also introduced GSM nationwide. By the time he left office, Germany had one of the most modern communications infrastructures in the world. In 1992, Schwarz-Schilling resigned his post in anger at Germany's inaction over atrocities in the then Yugoslavia -- rebuffing Chancellor Kohl's protestations that Germany's post- war constitution barred it from stepping in. He told the Chancellor he was \\"ashamed\\" to belong to such a government, saying he had entered politics in the first place to ensure that atrocities like those perpetrated by the Nazis \\"never happen again.\\" The Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung later commented that \\"most notable act in office was leaving it\\". As Yugoslavia lurched into chaos, Schwarz-Schilling began to try to mediate between the factions -- a role later formalised in the Washington agreement of 1994, and which he held until 2004. During and after the war, Schwarz-Schilling travelled around the country, trying to resolve disputes and later overseeing the return of some of the 2.2 million refugees -- half the population -- created by the conflict. . In 1995, he became chairperson of the sub-committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid. In 1998 the sub-committee became a full committee and Schwarz-Schilling became its vice-chairperson, serving until 2002. Critics To speed up the cable project, Schwarz-Schilling decided to involve private companies in the cable laying. Sonnenschein KG also had its wife's company involved in the \\"Projektgesellschaft f√ºr Kabel-Kommunikation mbH\\", where he had been managing director for many years. His shares on the Sonnenschein KG, he resigned only a few hours before his appointment as Postminister. Buyer of these shares was the Nixdorf Group. His decision to use copper, met both at home and abroad to wonder: It was already foreseen in the early 1980s that fiber optic cables are the \\"technology of the future.\\" During his tenure, Black Schilling was known as \\"Kohl's most affair rich minister\\". The trigger for these affairs were usually the complications of his wife's family business in Schwarz-Schilling's political decisions. Among the employees of the Deutsche Bundespost Schwarz-Schilling was anything but popular, as he was the last Postminister before privatization. So there was a joke among the staff: What does Schwarz-Schilling do when he comes to the office in the morning? He does the post. International political career Christian Schwarz-Schilling, 2010 On December 14, 2005, he was confirmed to replace Lord Ashdown both as the High Representative (OHR) -- a post created by the 1995 Dayton Agreement -- and as the EU's special representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On January 31, 2006 he was appointed as such. Schwarz-Schilling was nominated by the Bosniak and Bosnian Serb presidents. He has cast his role as that of \\"advisor\\" to the country who wants to \\"listen to the people\\" -- in contrast to his predecessor Ashdown, who attracted criticism particularly from Bosnian Serbs for relying too heavily on his Bonn-powers to force through legislation and sack elected officials. Under Schwarz-Schilling, the OHR seemed to soften its invasiveness, thanks to pressures from the Council of Europe and a growing EU involvement. The number of OHR legislative initiatives and of dismissed officials lowered. The EU decision to shut down the OHR by June 2007 unexpectedly arose disappointment and concern in the Bosnian population, NGOs, and politicians.Giulio Venneri, Modelling States from Brussels?, December 2007 During his time in office, nationwide research by Oxford Research International, which Schwarz-Schilling oversaw, showed that the silent majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina was significantly more tolerant and forward-looking than the politicians who represented them. It also showed that several policies implemented by national politicians and the international community were out of step with what the population wanted.http://www.undp.ba/upload/News/The%20Silent%20Majoriti%20Speaks%20Report.pdf and http://www.undp.ba/upload/News/Executive%20Summary%20The%20Silent%20Majority%20Speaks.pdf Slovak diplomat Miroslav Lajƒç√°k replaced Christian Schwarz-Schilling - who was originally intended to be the last holder of the post - on 30 June 2007.Miroslav Lajƒç√°k to succeed Schwarz-Schilling as High Representative , Office of the High Representative, 11 May 2007, accessed 23 May 2007 Lajƒç√°k retook a more intrusive approach in the work of the OHR, making it seem that apparently decreased intrusiveness was mostly due to the \\"weak personality\\" of Schwarz-Schilling. However, Schwarz-Schilling remains popular with the Bosnian population.

Del Valle, \\"Rouges-Bruns-Verts : L'√©trange alliance\\", Politique Internationale, no. 102 (January 2004), official translation. Retrieved 7 May 2016. Del Valle's conceptual rendering of Islamist ideological trends appears to be based at least partially on earlier writings in which he had charged the United States and western Europe with favouring the \\"war machine\\" of \\"armed Islamism\\" via its funding of the Afghani mujahideen during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, which helped future enemies of the West. In 2010, Del Valle published an essay in Italy titled \\"\\" (Red, Black, Green: The meeting of extreme opposites.)A. Del Valle, \\"Verdi, rossi e neri: chi sono i nemici dell'Occidente e perch√© ci odiano cos√¨, L'Occidentale, 3 December 2009. Retrieved 7 May 2016. The later popularity of the red-green-brown theory and its various permutations derives mainly from a speech given by Roger Cukierman, president of the French Jewish organization CRIF, to a CRIF banquet on 25 January 2003, and given wide circulation by a 27/28 January 2003 article in Le Monde. Cukierman used the French term \\"alliance brun-vert-rouge\\" to describe the antisemitic alignment supposedly shared by \\"an extreme right nostalgic for racial hierarchies\\" (symbolized by the color brown), \\"an extreme left [which is] anti-globalist, anti-capitalist, anti-American [and] anti- Zionist\\" (red), and followers of Jos√© Bov√© (green). In Great Britain in 2003, the politician George Galloway announced that he was seeking \\"to unify the red, green, anti-war, Muslim and other social constituencies radicalised by the war\\". Shortly thereafter, led by Salma Yaqoob and George Monbiot, the Socialist Workers Party and the Muslim Association of Britain formed an alliance in the Respect Party, under which Galloway ran for office. Respect initially tried to form an electoral pact with the Green Party of England and Wales,Matthew Tempest \\"Monbiot quits Respect over threat to Greens\\", The Guardian, 17 February 2004 but the Green Party refused to ally with Respect, saying that Respect did not align with their values of openness and democracy and had an under-developed political platform among other issues. In the United States, a similar alliance of disparate groups occurred in opposition to the World Trade Organization in the alter-globalization movement, which joined trade unions, neo-Luddite environmentalists, and paleoconservative nationalists like Pat Buchanan in common cause. Many were surprised by leftist Lenora Fulani's support for Pat Buchanan, which has been viewed as an example of a red‚Äìgreen‚Äìbrown alliance.

Typically this means editing the source code, or the textual representation of a document or program, instead of using a WYSIWYG editor that always displays an approximation of the final product. It may also mean translating the whole or parts of the source code into machine language manually instead of using a compiler or an automatic translator. Most commonly, it refers to directly writing HTML documents for the web (rather than in a specialized editor), or to writing a program or portion of a program in assembly language (more rarely raw machine code) rather than in a higher level language. It can also include other markup languages, such as wikitext.  Purpose  The reasons to use hand coding include the ability to: * Use features or refinements not supported by the graphical editor or compiler * Control the semantics of a document beyond that allowed by the graphical editorDigital Research (1981): XLT86 - 8080 to 8086 Assembly Language Translator - User's Guide. Digital Research Inc, Pacific Grove (). * Produce more elegant source code to help maintenance and integration * Produce better performing machine code than that produced by the compiler (see optimization) * Avoid having to pay for expensive WYSIWYG Editors. Note that there are some open-source editors available on the web, however. * Develop an understanding of the methods underlying a common level of abstraction. For example, although it has become rare in real-life scenarios, computer science students may be required to write a program in an assembly language to get a notion of processor registers and other basal elements of computer architecture. * Escape abstractions and templated code. Hand coding allows more refined control of code, which may improve efficiency, or add functionality that is otherwise unavailable. Hand coding may require more expertise and time than using automatic tools.  Hand Code  Hand code is source code which does not have tools that can edit it at a more abstract level. Hand code must, by definition, be edited and maintained entirely by hand. Some code can be edited either using an editor/IDE or by hand, but hand code is differentiated from derived code in that it requires human involvement to create and maintain it over time. Projects may include both hand code and derivative code. The automatic tools responsible for creating derivative code are themselves usually made up entirely, or at least in part, of hand code.

Entrainment is the transport of fluid across an interface between two bodies of fluid by a shear induced turbulent flux.Turner. 1973. Buoyancy Effects in Fluids pp. 167 The entrainment hypothesis was first used as a model for flow in plumes by G. I. Taylor when studying the use of oil drum fires to clear fog from aeroplane runways during World War II.Morton, B. R., G. I. Taylor, and J. S. Turner. 1956. Turbulent gravitational convection from maintained and instantaneous sources. Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A 234: 1‚Äì23. It has gone on to be a common model of turbulence closure used in environmental and geophysical fluid mechanics.Turner, J. S. 1986. Turbulent Entrainment: The Development of the Entrainment Assumption, and Its Application to Geophysical Flows. Journal of Fluid Mechanics 173: 431‚Äì471. Entrainment is important in turbulent jets, plumes and gravity currents and is a topic of current research. Eductors or eductor-jet pumps are an example of entrainment. They are used onboard many ships to pump out flooded compartments: in the event of an accident, seawater is pumped to the eductor and forced through a jet, and any fluid at the inlet of the eductor is carried along to the outlet and up and out of the compartment. Eductors can pump out whatever can flow through them, including water, oil, and small pieces of wood. Another example is the pump-jet, which is used for marine propulsion. Jet pumps are also used to circulate reactor coolant in several designs of boiling water reactors. In power generation, this phenomenon is used in steam jet air ejectors to maintain condenser vacuum by removing non-condensible gases from the condenser.

Role in the F√°tima apparitions Artur Santos was known for his hostility towards organized religion in general and Catholicism in particular. He was especially hostile with regards to the apparitions and repeatedly sent law enforcement officials to seek to impede public access to the site. He went so far as to kidnap the three children and place them in jail, in order to prevent them from proclaiming another apparition.

His preserved longer works are: *H√°konarm√°l - Composed in memory of king H√°kon and tells of his reception in Valhalla.

Its garage rock sound was balanced by melodies and angular rhythms. One year later, with the help of top polish producer Leszek Biolik and his studio team, the group recorded their second album, entitled Lake & Flames. Here, the music evolved into a much more eclectic hybrid of new wave energy, IDM beats, intimate acoustic balladry, string/horn arrangements and experimental psychedelia. It was met with nearly universal acclaim from the Polish media. The hype resulted in a number of awards, including the prestigious Fryderyk (the Polish equivalent of a Grammy) for the best alternative album of 2006. For the whole 2008 TCIOF was touring around Europe (they played at Glastonbury Festival).

In political history, the term directory, in French ', is applied to high collegial institutions of state composed of members styled director. The most important of these by far was the Directory of 1795‚Äì1799 in France. The system was inspired by the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, which prominently featured a collegial 12-member Supreme Executive Council with a primus inter pares President. Variants of this form of government, based on the French model, were also established in the European regions conquered by France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In the past, Uruguay, Yugoslavia (after 1974), Ukraine, and other countries were ruled by directories. The government of the Soviet Union could in some ways be characterized as a directory, but it developed in a much different pattern discussed in the article on Communist states. The sole country now using this form of government is Switzerland (and to a lesser extent, San Marino), where directories rule all levels of administration, federal, cantonal and municipal. The Swiss Federal Council is elected by the Parliament for four years (its members cannot be dismissed), and is composed of seven members, among whom one is president and one is vice- president, although these are completely symbolic. There is no relationship of confidence between Parliament and the Federal Council. It is a shared system of government that reflects and represents the heterogeneity and multiethnicity of the Swiss people. Direct popular elections are used at the local level. Definition A directorial system is a system of government in which the executive power is split among a select number of individuals who are, or de facto are, equals. Some have argued that diarchies such as Andorra are directorial as executive power is held between more than one person. Israel's parliamentary system, a codified, streamlined variant of the Westminster System under which executive power is vested directly in the multi-person Cabinet (in contrast to the President acting on the advice of the Cabinet, as in a normal Westminster System) can be seen as semi-directorial.

He is an associate editor and columnist for The Washington Post. He has written eleven novels, including Body of Lies, which director Ridley Scott adapted into a film. He is a former adjunct lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and currently Senior Fellow to the Future of Diplomacy Program. He has received numerous honors, including the Legion of Honor from the French Republic, the Urbino World Press Award from the Italian Republic, and a lifetime achievement award from the International Committee for Foreign Journalism. Personal life Ignatius was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His parents are Nancy Sharpless (n√©e Weiser) and Paul Robert Ignatius, a former Secretary of the Navy (1967‚Äì69), president of The Washington Post, and former president of the Air Transport Association. He is of Armenian descent on his father's side, with ancestors from Harput, Elazƒ±ƒü, Turkey; his mother, a descendant of Puritan minister Cotton Mather, is of German and English descent. Ignatius was raised in Washington, D.C., where he attended St. Albans School. He then attended Harvard College, from which he graduated magna cum laude in 1973. Ignatius was awarded a Frank Knox Fellowship from Harvard University and studied at King's College, Cambridge, where he received a diploma in economics. He is married to Dr. Eve Thornberg Ignatius, with whom he has three daughters.His brother, Adi Ignatius, is editor-in-chief of Harvard Business Review. Career David Ignatius =Journalism= After completing his education, Ignatius was an editor at the Washington Monthly before moving to the Wall Street Journal, where he spent ten years as a reporter. At the Journal, Ignatius first covered the steel industry in Pittsburgh. He then moved to Washington, where he covered the Justice Department, the CIA, and the Senate. Ignatius was the Journals Middle East correspondent from 1980 through 1983, during which time he covered the wars in Lebanon and Iraq. He returned to Washington in 1984, becoming chief diplomatic correspondent. In 1985 he received the Edward Weintal Prize for diplomatic reporting. In 1986 Ignatius left the Journal for the Washington Post. From 1986 to 1990 he was the editor of the \\"Outlook\\" section. From 1990 to 1992 he was foreign editor and oversaw the paper's Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning coverage of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. From 1993 to 1999 he served as assistant managing editor in charge of business news. In 1999 he began writing a twice-weekly column on global politics, economics and international affairs. In 2000 he became the executive editor of the International Herald Tribune in Paris. He returned to the Post in 2002 when the Post sold its interest in the Herald Tribune. Ignatius continued to write his column once a week during his tenure at the Herald Tribune, resuming twice-weekly columns after his return to the Post. His column is syndicated worldwide by The Washington Post Writers Group. The column won the 2000 Gerald Loeb Award for Commentary and a 2004 Edward Weintal Prize. In writing his column, Ignatius frequently travels to the Middle East and interviews leaders such as Syrian president Bashar al- Assad and Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the Lebanese military organization Hezbollah. Ignatius's writing has also appeared in the New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, Foreign Affairs, The New Republic, Talk Magazine, and The Washington Monthly. Ignatius's coverage of the CIA has been criticized as being defensive and overly positive. Melvin A. Goodman, a 42-year CIA veteran, Johns Hopkins professor, and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, has called Ignatius \\"the mainstream media's apologist for the Central Intelligence Agency,\\" citing as examples Ignatius's criticism of the Obama administration for investigating the CIA's role in the use of torture in interrogations during the Iraq War and his charitable defense of the agency's motivations for outsourcing such activities to private contractors. Columnist Glenn Greenwald has leveled similar criticism against Ignatius. Ignatius supported the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. On a number of occasions, however, Ignatius criticized the CIA and the U.S. government's approach on intelligence. He was also critical of the Bush administration's torture policies. On March 12, 2014, he wrote a two-page descriptive opinion on Putin's strengths and weaknesses that was published in the Journal and Courier soon after. On March 26, 2014, Ignatius wrote a piece in the Washington Post on the crisis in Ukraine and how the world will deal with Putin's actions. Ignatius's theory of history is that it is a chaos and that \\"good\\" things are not preordained, \\"decisive turns in history can result from ruthless political leaders, from weak or confused adversaries, or sometimes just from historical accident. Might doesn't make right, but it does create 'facts on the ground' that are hard to reverse.\\" His piece mentioned four-star USAF general Philip M. Breedlove, the current NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, and Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsya. Putin, says Ignatius, \\"leads what by most political and economic indicators is a weak nation‚Äîa declining power, not a rising one.\\" He places great hope in Angela Merkel. =Novels= In addition to being a journalist, Ignatius is a successful novelist. He has written ten novels in the suspense/espionage fiction genre that draw on his experience and interest in foreign affairs and his knowledge of intelligence operations. Reviewers have compared Ignatius's work to classic spy novels like those by Graham Greene. Ignatius's novels have also been praised for their realism; his first novel, Agents of Innocence, was at one point described by the CIA on its website as \\"a novel but not fiction.\\" His 1999 novel, The Sun King, a reworking of The Great Gatsby set in late-20th-century Washington, is his only departure from the espionage genre. His 2007 novel, Body of Lies, was adapted into a film by director Ridley Scott. It starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have acquired the rights to Ignatius's seventh novel, The Increment.Bruckheimer, Disney buy 'Increment': Duo nab rights to Ignatius' thriller, by Michael Fleming (Variety, May 13, 2008) The Quantum Spy, published in 2017, is an espionage thriller about the race between the United States and China to build the world's first hyper-fast quantum computer. His most recent book is The Paladin: A Spy Novel (2020). =Opera= In May 2015, MSNBC's Morning Joe announced that Ignatius would be teaming up with composer Mohammed Fairouz to create a political opera called The New Prince, based on the teachings of Niccolo Machiavelli. The opera was commissioned by the Dutch National Opera.Morning Joe: Composer and Journalist Team Up for Opera Speaking with The Washington Post, Ignatius described the broad themes of the opera in terms of three chapters: \\"The first chapter is about revolution and disorder. Revolutions, like children, are lovable when young, and they become much less lovable as they age. The second lesson Machiavelli tells us is about sexual obsession, among leaders. And then the final chapter is basically is the story of Dick Cheney [and] bin Laden, the way in which those two ideas of what we're obliged to do as leaders converged in such a destructive way.\\" The New Librettist of The New Prince =Other= In 2006 Ignatius wrote a foreword to the American edition of Moazzam Begg's Enemy Combatant, a book about the author's experiences as a detainee at the Guant√°namo Bay detention camp. In 2008, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Brent Scowcroft, and Ignatius published America and the World: Conversations on the Future of American Foreign Policy, a book that collected conversations, moderated by Ignatius, between Brzezinski and Scowcroft. Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times named it one of the ten best books of 2008. Ignatius has been trustee of the German Marshall Fund since 2000. He has been a member of the Council on Foreign Relations since 1984. From 1984 to 1990 he was a member of the governing board of St. Albans School. In 2011 Ignatius held a contest for Washington Post readers to write a spy novel. Ignatius wrote the first chapter and challenged fans to continue the story. Over eight weeks, readers sent in their versions of what befalls CIA agents Alex Kassem and Sarah Mancini and voted for their favorite entries. Ignatius chose the winning entry for each round, resulting in a six-chapter Web serial. Winners of the subsequent chapters included Chapter 2, \\"Sweets for the Sweet,\\" by Colin Flaherty; Chapter 3, \\"Abu Talib,\\" by Jill Borak; Chapter 4, \\"Go Hard or Go Home,\\" by Vineet Daga; Chapter 5, \\"Inside Out,\\" by Colin Flaherty; and Chapter 6, \\"Onward!,\\" by Gina 'Miel' Ard. In early 2012 Ignatius served as an adjunct lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, teaching an international affairs course titled Understanding the Arab Spring from the Ground Up: Events in the Middle East, their Roots and Consequences for the United States. He is currently serving as a senior fellow at the Future of Diplomacy Program at Harvard University.Harvard Kennedy School In 2018, he won a George Polk Award, for his coverage of the Jamal Khashoggi murder. According to the 2018 membership list, Ignatius is a member of the Trilateral Commission. Controversy =2009 Davos incident= At the 2009 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Ignatius moderated a discussion including then Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, Israeli president Shimon Peres, UN secretary- general Ban Ki-moon, and Arab League secretary-general Amr Moussa. As the December 2008‚ÄìJanuary 2009 conflict in Gaza was still fresh in memory, the tone of the discussion was lively. Ignatius gave Erdoƒüan 12 minutes to speak and gave the Israeli president 25 minutes to respond. Erdoƒüan objected to Peres's tone and raised voice during the Israeli president's impassioned defense of his nation's actions. Ignatius gave Erdoƒüan a minute to respond (Erdoƒüan repeatedly insisted \\"One minute,\\"\\"One minute\\" means \\"Bir dakika\\" in Turkish when translated literally, but also \\"Bir dakika\\" means \\"wait a minute\\". (https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english/one_minute , https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english/bir_dakika) in English), and when Erdoƒüan went over his allocated minute, Ignatius repeatedly cut the Turkish prime minister off, telling him and the audience that they were out of time and that they had to adjourn to a dinner. Erdoƒüan seemed visibly frustrated as he said confrontationally to the Israeli president, \\"When it comes to killing, you know well how to kill.\\" Ignatius put his arm on Erdoƒüan's shoulder and continued to tell him that his time was up. Erdoƒüan then gathered his papers and walked out, saying, \\"I do not think I will be coming back to Davos after this because you do not let me speak.\\" Writing about the Davos incident later, Ignatius said that he found himself \\"in the middle of a fight where there was no longer a middle. [...] Because the Israel‚ÄìPalestinian conflict provokes such heated emotions on both sides of the debate,\\" Ignatius concluded, \\"it was impossible for anyone to be seen as an impartial mediator.\\" Ignatius wrote that his experience elucidated a larger truth about failure of the United States' attempt to serve as an impartial mediator in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. \\"American leaders must give up the notion that they can transform the Middle East and its culture through military force,\\" he wrote, and instead \\"get out of the elusive middle, step across the threshold of anger, and sit down and talk\\" with the Middle Eastern leaders.

She was the first woman nominated to the Coll√®ge de France, and in 1988, the second woman to enter the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. She is primarily known for her work on the culture and language of ancient Greece, and in particular on Thucydides. Biography Born in Chartres, Eure-et-Loir, she studied at the Lyc√©e Moli√®re. As a schoolgirl, she became the first female to qualify for a prize in the Concours g√©n√©ral, taking the first prize in Latin to French translation and second prize in Ancient Greek in 1930. She then prepared for the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. She entered the class of 1933 of the ENS Ulm. She passed the agr√©gation in Classics in 1936; however, because she was of Jewish ancestry, the Vichy government suspended her from her teaching duties during the Occupation of France.\\"D‚Äôorigine juive, elle est suspendue de ses fonctions par le r√©gime de Vichy en 1941.\\" She became a doctor of letters at the University of Paris in 1947. Her doctoral thesis, a \\"masterful\\" treatment of Athenian imperialism in Thucydides, was published as Thucydide et l'imp√©rialisme ath√©nien, and subsequently translated into English as Thucydides and Athenian Imperialism. After being a schoolteacher, she became a professor at Lille University and subsequently at the Sorbonne, between 1957 and 1973. She later was promoted to the chair of Greek and the development of moral and political thought at the Coll√®ge de France ‚Äî the first woman nominated to this prestigious institution. In 1988, she was the second woman (after Marguerite Yourcenar) to enter the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, being elected to Chair #7, which was previously occupied by Andr√© Roussin. She published dozens of works on Greek philosophy, language and literature but her lifelong passion was Thucydides, the historian of the Peloponnesian War. Outside academia she was best known to the French public for touring French schools and giving talks about the culture of ancient Greeks. She was a staunch defender of teaching of humanities in French schools, believing that an understanding of the classics was essential to understanding democracy, the liberty of the individual and the virtue of tolerance. In 1984 she published L‚ÄôEnseignement en d√©tresse, a book about declining standards in French schools. Her position in the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise enabled her to mount a defence of classical languages and literary culture, which she stated ‚Äúmay well be as endangered as the fauna of the oceans or the water of our rivers‚Äù. She was horrified by the 1988 vote to simplify aspects of the French language in primary schools and in 1992 she founded an Association for the Defence of Literary Studies. In 1995, she obtained Greek nationality and in 2000 was named as an Ambassador of Hellenism by the Greek government. A one-time president of the Association Guillaume Bud√©, she remained an honorary president until her death at a hospital in Boulogne- Billancourt at the age of 97. After having only received baptism in 1940, she fully converted to Maronite Catholicism in 2008, aged 95. Influence De Romilly's two monographs on the ancient Greek historian Thucydides have been credited with \\"alter[ing] the landscape of Thucydidean scholarship\\" and \\"the beginning of a new era\\". In 2002, Danish classical scholar Anders Holm Rasmussen described her views on Thucydides' ideology of empire as still \\"one of the most important viewpoints\\" with which modern scholars can engage. Published first in 1956, her work Histoire et raison chez Thucydide is still in print in the original French today, and was translated into English as The Mind of Thucydides after her death.http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2013/2013-04-53.html De Romilly believed that Thucydides's intelligent, reflective approach held lessons relevant to the Europe of today. De Romilly also published outside the field of Greek historiography. In recent years, the value of her work Time in Greek Tragedy has been recognized by scholars working not only on Greek drama but also on Aristotle's metaphysics of time. In 2016, Rosie Wyles and Edith Hall edited a volume called Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly, a history of pioneering women born between the Renaissance and 1913 who played significant roles in the history of classical scholarship.

In 1983, he earned a master of arts in teaching at National Louis University. At age 29, he ran for alderman in Chicago's 43rd ward to succeed the retiring Martin J. Oberman. The race, between him and attorney Robert Perkins was dubbed by observers as the Battle of the Blue Bloods as both young candidates came from wealthy, well connected families. As an alderman, he backed the ward map proposed by Richard M. Daley in a referendum. The referendum, an oddity, was a choice between two maps, but in lieu of the actual maps, voters were asked to choose a map based on a list of alderman that supported each respective map. He also backed reforming Chicago Public Schools. He ran for Congress in Illinois's 9th congressional district in the 1990 Democratic primary election against longtime incumbent Sid Yates. Eisendrath ran an anti-incumbent campaign focused on Yates' long tenure in the United States House of Representatives. Eisendrath lost in a landslide. In October 1993, he resigned as alderman to become the administrator for the Region V office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in Chicago, one of HUD's largest and busiest. He formerly served as Vice President of Academic Affairs for Kendall College but resigned the position in 2007. He sought the Democratic nomination for Governor of Illinois in 2006 but was defeated in the primary by incumbent governor Rod Blagojevich. From 2007 to 2017, he was an international business consultant with a focus on global higher education. In 2017, he led a group, including retired WLS-TV anchor Linda Yu and the Chicago Federation of Labor, to place a bid for the Chicago Sun-Times. It was announced July 13 that the group, ST Acquisition Holdings LLC, purchased the Sun-Times. Shortly thereafter, Eisendrath was named the Chicago Sun Times new chief executive officer. In January 2018, he hired Mark Konkol as executive editor of then-Sun-Times-owned Chicago Reader Konkol and Eisendrath soon published an issue with racist cover. Without taking responsibility himself, Eisendrath fired Konkol. Later in 2018, the Sun-Times board took action and accepted Eisendrath's resignation as CEO.

The route featured long ascents on both sides of the Pennines with the long Woodhead Tunnel at its central summit close to the Woodhead pass. This led to the route being called the Woodhead Line. The route The main route ran from Manchester London Road (later Manchester Piccadilly) over the Pennines, through the Woodhead Tunnel to Penistone, where the Wath line split. The main line then proceeded through Sheffield Victoria Station and on to Rotherwood sidings. The Wath line ran from Penistone to Wath marshalling yard in the heart of the South Yorkshire coalfields. Minor electrified branches off the main line ran to the locomotive depot at Reddish on the Fallowfield Loop line, to Glossop (for local passenger trains), Dewsnap sidings (all at the Manchester end) and Tinsley Marshalling Yard (at the Sheffield end). Electrification = Prewar situation and progress = Penistone station in 1954 Following developments with electric traction in the USA, the Great Central Railway (GCR) first considered the electrification of the line before the First World War. No detailed plans were drawn up, but by the 1920s the high levels of heavy freight traffic made steam operation increasingly problematic. Plans were interrupted by the 1923 grouping of the railways, which saw the GCR absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The operational problems remained into the 1930s. In 1935 the government made credits available to the railways to provide relief for unemployed persons in the Great Depression so the LNER restarted the project: planning and works for electrification commenced. The system was to be electrified at 1,500 V DC, similar to the Dutch style of electrification that had also been used on the LNER's Newport‚ÄìShildon line. This system had the advantage that regenerative braking could easily be employed; this provided braking by allowing an electric locomotive's motors to act as generators, thus assisting with control of heavy freight trains when running downhill. The power generated by a descending train's braking was fed back to the overhead lines and either used by other trains requiring power in the same block of line, or dissipated as heat in resistive loads at the electrical sub-stations. Nearly all of the gantries for the overhead wires between Manchester London Road and the west portal of Woodhead were erected, and a prototype locomotive was constructed, by the time the Second World War intervened. The locomotive was loaned to the Netherlands Railways (NS) immediately after the Second World War to assist in working the war-damaged railways there; in the process of this it acquired the nickname \\"Tommy\\" in honour of the British foot soldier. Later, after repatriation to Britain, this nickname was used officially. = Postwar: running the wires = In 1948 the LNER was nationalised as a part of British Railways. Nearly 30 years had elapsed and the operational problems remained, so money was made available to complete the electrification project. By now the state of the original Woodhead tunnels meant that a new double- track tunnel had to be built to replace the two original single-track bores. Thurgoland tunnel gained a new bore to alleviate clearance problems in the original tunnel. New electric locomotive facilities were built at Reddish, Darnall and Wath, and two classes of locomotive were built at Gorton Locomotive Works, Manchester, for the line: the EM1 (Class 76) Bo+Bo (the + signifying that the bogies were articulated) mixed-traffic locomotives and seven larger EM2 (Class 77) Co-Co locomotives for express passenger trains. To save on costs, the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) loop line into Manchester Central station was not electrified, as was originally in the plan: Manchester-bound passenger trains terminated at London Road (later Piccadilly), while those few passenger trains destined for further afield changed locomotives at Guide Bridge. This was hardly the only austerity measure in the immediate postwar period; other cost-cutting measures in the MSW scheme included retention of signal boxes rather than use of power signalling, and the new Up tunnel at Thurgoland rather than daylighting the original bore. The Wath to Penistone section was the first to be energised, on 2 February 1952. Completion of the main line was delayed until 1954 by a collapse in the new Woodhead tunnel, and also by the decision to completely re-signal the whole main line with colour-light signals after sighting problems with the semaphore signals on the Wath branch (nevertheless, some semaphores were retained, which generally remained in service until closure). On 30 May 1954 electric trains began running through the tunnel and the Manchester to Penistone section was fully energised on 14 June. The Sheffield Victoria to Penistone section followed on 20 September 1954. At this time the system had its official opening despite not being fully complete: the final few miles from Sheffield Victoria to the system's eastern extremity at Rotherwood was declared open on 3 January 1955. In 1965 the scheme was extended to the brand-new Tinsley Marshalling Yard in Sheffield. The locomotive facilities at the Sheffield end of the line were moved from Darnall to the new Tinsley depot. The overhead line equipment on this section was designed to be easily convertible to 25 kV AC electrification, which by now had been accepted as the standard overhead electrification system for BR. = Benefits and characteristics = During closure of the Midland line for removal of a tunnel between Chesterfield and Sheffield, trains from St Pancras to Manchester were diverted via the Woodhead Line. In September 1969, a westbound diesel-hauled train arrives at Sheffield Victoria's Platform 3, with an EM1 (Class 76) electric locomotive waiting to take the train forward Two 2-8-0s banking a westbound freight up Worsborough Bank towards West Silkstone Junction in August 1950 The benefits of electrification were immediately apparent: Sheffield to Manchester expresses now completed the journey in 56 minutes as opposed to 65 minutes with steam traction; an 850-ton coal train took a mere 66 minutes between Wath and Dunford Bridge as opposed to nearly two and a half hours powered by steam. The Worsborough (or Wentworth) incline, also known as Worsborough Bank was a formidable feature on the Wath to Penistone section. This line was opened east of Silkstone in 1880 to alleviate congestion at Barnsley. Although nominally 1 in 40, colliery subsidence had made sections of the bank much steeper. The difficulty in operating this steeply-graded section (which included the two Silkstone tunnels) with steam traction was a key reason for electrification. Before electrification a unique powerful Garratt locomotive was built to act as a banker for this section of line, otherwise the normal mode of operation was for two or sometimes even three bankers for the Worsborough incline plus a pilot locomotive to assist from Wath to Dunford Bridge. Even with five locomotives, heavy trains had slowed to a walking pace by Silkstone. After electrification, much heavier coal trains could be handled up the bank; however problems with unfitted trains running away on the downgrades west of the Pennines restricted weights on such trains. In later years MGR (Merry-Go-Round) coal trains, running direct from pit to power station became the main traffic with the coal carried in block trains of 30, 32-tonne capacity air-braked wagons. These were normally double-headed by two Class 76 locomotives to their destination with two additional Class 76s banking at the rear from Wombwell to Silkstone. This was the only section of railway in the UK to be regularly operated by four locomotives per train. A \\"Clearcall\\" intercom system (via the overhead electric wires) was developed to allow the crews of the front and rear locomotives to communicate, replacing earlier air-horn codes. The purpose- built power control centre for the line was adjacent to Penistone station. The building still stands, but has been adapted for alternative commercial use. As much of the line was prone to colliery subsidence, many of the portal structures which supported the overhead wires contained crossbeams which were designed to be easily adjustable upwards or downwards, using permanent way cranes; the ground-level trackside power feed, communications and signalling cables were similarly adjustable. Some limitations of the Woodhead electrification became apparent, especially with the advent of the double- headed, double-banked merry-go-round unit trains previously mentioned. Whilst such a train was climbing Worsborough Incline, all other electric trains were prohibited from entering or moving within the power section between Strafford Crossing and Aldam Junction, lest the substations at these two locations tripped out from the high current draw. Heavy current loads also caused flashovers in the oil-impregnated paper-insulated lead-covered 33 kV ground- level feeder cable at locations where cable segments were joined together in sealed boxes; such loads were not present in the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway and Great Eastern 1.5 kV DC schemes, both of which served only electric multiple units, not locomotive-hauled trains. Closure A geographically accurate map of the route. Electric trans-Pennine passenger services lasted just 16 years. The Beeching Report had specified that only one Manchester‚ÄìSheffield route should stay open to passengers and that route would be Woodhead. However local opposition to the closure of the alternative Hope Valley line, the high cost of providing an electrified link into Sheffield Midland station as Sheffield Victoria was slated for closure, and the impending opening of the massive Fiddlers Ferry Power Station requiring even more trans-Pennine freight train paths from the South Yorkshire Coalfield, all conspired against passenger use of the Woodhead line, which closed to passengers on 5 January 1970. A local electric service remained at the Manchester end of the line and the Sheffield‚ÄìPenistone service was left in the hands of diesel trains. The Class 77 express passenger train locomotives were sold to the Netherlands national railway company Nederlandse Spoorwegen, becoming NS Class 1500. By the late 1970s freight traffic, including South Yorkshire coal, had declined to the extent that British Rail took the decision to close the route, effective 18 July 1981; only the Manchester‚ÄìGlossop/Hadfield local passenger trains were left running. BR claimed that the cost of replacing the out-of-date and non-standard equipment on the main section of the line was prohibitive. All but one of the remaining Class 76 locomotives were scrapped. The Wath branch was rapidly lifted between Wombwell Main Junction and West Silkstone Junction. As a part of the closure agreement, the track on the Sheffield‚ÄìPenistone‚ÄìHadfield section of the route was left in place for five years. 1986 saw much of the remaining track lifted, except for the sections in the vicinity of Penistone station (which remained open for Sheffield‚ÄìHuddersfield trains), and east of Deepcar, which remained for both freight and passenger traffic in the Sheffield area. In December 1984 the remaining equipment at the Manchester end of the line was modified to the standard 25 kV AC, thus ending the use of 1,500 V DC overhead electrification on British Rail. The Class 506 were withdrawn at the same time, being replaced by Class 303 EMUs from the Glasgow area. The line is now operated by Class 323 EMUs.

The non-profit group is based in Toronto but has an international membership. It supports nearly all Commodore computers, including the PET, VIC-20, C64, C128, Plus/4, C16, C65, and Amiga, including the COMAL, CP/M and GEOS environments. TPUG is noted for its ties with Commodore Canada, its extensive and widely distributed software library, and its association with prominent computing pioneers such as Jim Butterfield, Brad Templeton, Karl Hildon, and Steve Punter.  History  The Commodore PET 2001 TPUG was founded in 1978 or 1979 by Lyman Duggan, a Toronto-area resident who had recently bought a Commodore PET 2001 but could not find an existing user group with any PET owners. At the urging of local author and programmer Jim Butterfield, Duggan organized his own PET group‚Äîthen known as CLUB 2001‚Äîand advertised it by word of mouth. The first meeting was held in the party room of Duggan's condominium, with Butterfield as the invited speaker. Some 35 people showed up. Attendance at subsequent meetings grew rapidly, leading Duggan to shift them to ever-larger venues‚Äîfirst to the Ontario Science Centre and later to a theatre at Sheridan College. When Duggan was unexpectedly transferred by his employer to Florida in 1980, he nominated a board of directors to replace him, and TPUG was transformed from a privately run enterprise into a members' club. By 1982 it had over 2000 members, with 40 more signing up each week, and a magazine circulation of 3000. The club reached its peak in the mid-1980s, with membership figures variously reported between 15,000 and 22,000. It thus became one of the largest and longest- running user groups in the world. The club's scope grew to include other Commodore computers, with dedicated chapters for the PET, VIC-20, Commodore 64, Commodore 128, and Amiga. TPUG held over a hundred chapter meetings each year, with attendance at the largest ones reaching about 700.  Operations  In the 1980s TPUG employed a full-time staff to process memberships and to operate its software library and magazine publishing operations. The club became a central clearing house for freeware for the PET, VIC-20, C64, and other Commodore 8-bit computers. Disks and tapes were distributed by mail to a network of associated Commodore user groups across North America and around the world. Jim Butterfield authored much of the original TPUG software library and he continued to distribute new programs through the club. the software library was still maintained, and has been released in its entirety on CD-ROM, though there is little demand for titles for the very oldest machines. TPUG's publishing arm produced a number of print periodicals for internal and external distribution, including the standalone journals TPUG Magazine (1984‚Äì1986) and TPUG Newsletter (1988‚Äì), as well as TPUG News (1987‚Äì1988) which was distributed as an insert in Karl Hildon's magazine The Transactor. An earlier club magazine, The TORPET, was produced independently under commercial contract from 1980. In 1984 its owner, Bruce Beach, dissociated the publication from TPUG and relaunched it as an oceanography journal. TPUG was regularly involved in Commodore Canada's annual World of Commodore computer expos since their launch in 1983. The early Toronto-based shows saw attendance of around 40,000, but the series became moribund some years after Commodore's demise in 1994. In 2004 TPUG revived the World of Commodore shows, which continue under their aegis, albeit on a much reduced scale. In its early decades, the club kept in touch with members and associates around the world through its dial-up bulletin board system, which was programmed and operated by Steve Punter and Sylvia Gallus. TPUG also maintained a presence on private online services of the day and eventually the Internet and World Wide Web. In the 2000s the club set up a special web server running on a Commodore 64, and within a week it had received hits from thousands of other Commodore machines. Current activities Though membership has dwindled, TPUG continues to hold monthly meetings where 12 to 15 attending members trade software, share hacking tips, and troubleshoot old hardware. The club continues to organize the annual World of Commodore expo in Toronto, with attendance figures around 100. On 20 January 2013, the club staged a flash mob at Starbucks to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the Commodore SX-64 portable computer. The publicity generated led to Starbucks Corporation approaching TPUG to recreate the event for a promotional documentary film. The short film, which shows club members invading a Kipling Starbucks with PETs, SX-64s, and other antique computers, was released by the corporation in October 2014 as part of its \\"Meet Me At Starbucks\\" series.

Some of Wall's grills cost nearly $30,000. In hip hop culture, a grill (most commonly referred to as grills or grillz), also known as fronts or golds, is a type of dental jewelry worn over the teeth. Grills are made of metal and are generally removable. They began to be worn by hip-hop artists in New York City in the early 1980s, and upgraded during the '90s in Oakland. They became even more widely popular during the mid-2000s due to the rise of Southern hip hop rap and the more mainstream pop culture status hip hop attained.  Characteristics and wearer demographics  Dental grills inlaid with stones Grills are made of several types of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are sometimes inlaid with precious stones; they are generally removable, though some may be permanently attached to the teeth.Schepp, David. \\"Gold Teeth Are a Gold Mine.\\" BBC News (August 3, 2001).

Accessed January 1, 2014. Grills can cost anywhere from one hundred dollars to thousands of dollars, depending on the materials used and the number of teeth covered.Sims, Brian. \\"History of the Grill.\\" Hip Hop DX (July 17, 2006). Accessed September 14, 2007. As of 2006, grills were most often worn by 18- to 35-year-old African-American male hip- hop listeners,Laue, Christine. \\"Grins with Grills.\\" Omaha World-Herald (February 7, 2006). Grills received mainstream attention, including on network television, when, during the 2012 Summer Olympics, Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte posed with a grill that sported stones in the design of an American flag; he had previously worn diamond grills after earlier competitions.  History  The insertion of gems into teeth predates hip hop culture, and started in what is now Mexico when wealthy Mayans drilled pieces of jade into their teeth. Hip hop artists such as Raheem the Dream and Kilo Ali began wearing grills in the early 1980s; New Yorker Eddie Plein, owner of Eddie's Gold Teeth, is often credited with bringing the trend to New York. Plein made gold caps for Flavor Flav, and then outfitted New York rappers including Big Daddy Kane and Kool G. Rap. He later moved to Atlanta, where he designed ever-more-elaborate grills for rappers like OutKast, Goodie Mob, Ludacris, and Lil Jon. Other writers have cited Slick Rick and Afrika Bambaataa as an important early contributor to the popularity of grills.Steven, Curtis. \\"Rap Sinks Teeth into Grills.\\" Tampa Tribune (February 2, 2006).Jones, Vanessa E. \\"Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is.\\" Boston Globe (January 31, 2006). Grills remained popular in the Southern U.S., especially in Houston or Memphis, even as they rose and fell from popularity elsewhere, and the rise of Dirty South rappers in the 2000s spurred a nationwide grill trend. During this time, grills frequently appeared in hip hop music, most notably in the 2005 number one single \\"Grillz,\\" by Nelly, Paul Wall, Big Gipp, and Ali, and in other Paul Wall songs. Wall is known for his grill business as well as his rapping; his clients include Kanye West and Cam'ron.Heldman, Breanne L. \\"More Bite for the Buck.\\" New York Daily News (October 6, 2005). Grills maintained their popularity into the 2010s, with French grillmaker Dolly Cohen creating custom oral jewelry for Rihanna, Cara Delevingne, and Rita Ora. In 2015, DJ Khaled created a song based around grills, \\"Gold Slugs\\" (feat. Chris Brown, August Alsina & Fetty Wap) Gold Slugs also is used as a term similar to grills with the same meaning.  Manufacture  More expensive grills are shaped to fit custom dental molds like this one. While early grills could not be removed easily and involved reshaping the tooth itself to fit the grill, grills are today made from custom dental molds. For more expensive grills, a dentist takes a mold of the wearer's front teeth with a quick set alginate.Phillips, Bianca. \\"Rappers May Lose Reason To Smile.\\" Memphis Flyer (February 7, 2007). A tooth mold is obtained by filling the alginate negative with buff stone, then the buff stone is used to fit the grill to the unique set of teeth. However, for inexpensive novelty grills, a jeweler may make an impression by having the wearer bite into dental putty or wax softened in water, or the wearer may do this themself.Bauer, Andrea. \\"What Are You Wearing?\\" Chicago Reader (September 8, 2006).Hill, Ian. \\"Grills Gone Wild.\\" The Record (Stockton) (December 19, 2005). Such grills may be less comfortable or dependable than grills that are professionally fitted,\\"Various grill types and styles\\" Deezgrillz.com (November 10, 2016) and in several instances jewelers manufacturing grills in this manner have been charged with practicing dentistry without a license.Rosenbaum, S.I. \\"Jeweler's Gold Grill Business to Lose Its Luster.\\" St. Petersburg Times (December 17, 2005).  Criticism and health hazards  According to the American Dental Association (ADA) in June 2006, no studies have shown whether the long-term wearing of grills is safe.American Dental Association. \\"Dentists Say Dental Grills (Grillz) Might Bring Glitz, But Could Tarnish Smile.\\" ADA.org (June 28, 2006).

The ADA has warned, however, that grills made from base metals could cause irritation or allergic reactions, and that bacteria trapped under a grill worn on a long-term basis could result in gum disease, cavities, or even bone loss.Du Lac, J.

At the conclusion of the show Ares revealed himself as the man who had been stalking UltraMantis Black, at which point Castagnoli turned rudo by attacking Mike Quackenbush. After beating the entire tecnico roster Castagnoli aligned himself with Ares, Tursas, Pinkie Sanchez, Tim Donst, Sara Del Rey and Daizee Haze to form the Bruderschaft des Kreuzes.

Later on in the pay-per-view, Cesaro entered his first Royal Rumble match at number 22. He lasted a decent amount of time, and even managed to eliminate Daniel Bryan, but was the 18th man eliminated by the eventual winner John Cena. Cesaro's feud with Miz continued on 17 February at Elimination Chamber, where he retained the United States Championship via disqualification after Miz accidentally hit him in the groin. Cesaro and Miz faced off in a Two-out-of-Three falls match for the United States Championship on 1 March SmackDown, where Cesaro yet again retained his title. During 21 March NXT tapings (which aired on 24 April due to tape delay), Cesaro successfully retained his title against Adrian Neville during the \\"Clash of the Champions\\" NXT. On 15 April Raw, Cesaro lost the United States Championship to Kofi Kingston in an upset victory, ending his long-lived reign at 239 days. Cesaro received his rematch for the title on 1 May episode of Main Event, but was again defeated by Kingston.  The Real Americans (2013‚Äì2014)  In 2013, Cesaro formed The Real Americans with Zeb Colter and Jack Swagger In May, Cesaro started a feud with Sami Zayn in NXT, where the two held some of what would later be considered the best matches of 2014. The two first squared off in the ring during the 22 May episode of NXT, where Zayn scored an upset victory over Cesaro in his debut match. Cesaro later defeated Zayn in a rematch on 13 June episode of NXT. On 17 June episode of Raw, Cesaro became an associate of Zeb Colter. Colter and Cesaro went on to justify their alliance by saying that Cesaro is the ultimate (legal) immigrant and thus a superior American. Cesaro unsuccessfully challenged Bo Dallas for the NXT Championship on 3 July episode of NXT. At the Money in the Bank pay- per-view, Cesaro and Colter's fellow client Jack Swagger competed in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, but were both unsuccessful as the match was won by Damien Sandow. The following night on Raw, Cesaro and Swagger, now billed as \\"The Real Americans\\", teamed together for the first time, but ended up being defeated by The Usos. On 21 August episode of NXT, Cesaro defeated Zayn in a Two-out-of-Three Falls Match to conclude the feud. During the Night of Champions pre-show, The Real Americans competed in a number one contenders Tag Team Turmoil match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, in which they were the last team eliminated by The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil). Simultaneously, The Real Americans began a feud with the returning Santino Marella after he defeated both of them in singles competition. On 6 October at Battleground, The Real Americans defeated Marella and The Great Khali in a tag team match. The Real Americans moved onto feuding with Los Matadores, culminating in a tag team match on 27 October at Hell in a Cell, which Los Matadores won. The following night on Raw, The Real Americans defeated WWE Tag Team Champions Cody Rhodes and Goldust in a non-title match. At the Raw of 18 November in Nashville, Tennessee, a fan handed out a hundred simple black and white signs on standard printer paper with the words \\"Cesaro Section\\" printed on them. A group of fans held them up together in Cesaro's match and this made it to air and was remarked on by the commentators, as well as by Cesaro himself after the show; this was picked up by other fans, and the Cesaro Section phenomenon quickly spread from there to other arenas and events. In early 2014, The Real Americans competed against several tag teams (Rey Mysterio and Big Show/Sin Cara as well as The Usos), but were not successful in winning. Cesaro also competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, entering at number 21, but was eliminated by Roman Reigns. On 31 January episode of SmackDown, Cesaro defeated Dolph Ziggler to earn a spot at the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. On 14 February SmackDown, while his ring name was shortened to Cesaro, he defeated WWE World Heavyweight Champion Randy Orton clean in a non-title match. At the Elimination Chamber, Cesaro was eliminated third by Cena via submission. On 27 February at NXT Arrival, Cesaro defeated Zayn again, but embraced Zayn after the match. On the post-WrestleMania Raw, Hulk Hogan endorsed and congratulated Cesaro for winning the Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania XXX During the Wrestlemania XXX pre-show, The Real Americans were the final team eliminated during a Fatal Four-Way Tag Team Elimination Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Jack Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in the Patriot Lock before Colter demanded that the duo to shake hands. Cesaro instead retaliated with a Cesaro Swing on Swagger. Later during the pay-per- view Cesaro was a surprise entrant in the inaugural Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which he won by making the final elimination of the Big Show, body slamming him over the top rope and out of the ring in a manner reminiscent of Hulk Hogan's body slam of Andr√© at WrestleMania III. In a 2015 interview Cesaro would describe this victory as his \\"career highlight\\" to that point.  Teaming with Tyson Kidd (2014‚Äì2015)  On the post-WrestleMania Raw on 7 April, Hogan endorsed Cesaro's WrestleMania victory. Cesaro proceeded to dump Colter as his manager, instead revealing that he was a Paul Heyman guy. After Cesaro was eliminated by Rob Van Dam from a tournament for an Intercontinental Championship title shot, he defeated Van Dam and Swagger in an elimination match at Extreme Rules in May. Cesaro had a series of matches against United States Champion Sheamus, but failed to win the title at Payback in June. Cesaro then defeated Van Dam to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match for the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by John Cena. After that, Cesaro went on to lose to likes of Kofi Kingston and Big E in singles matches, while also being eliminated by Heath Slater in a battle royal for the Intercontinental Championship at Battleground in July. On 21 July Raw, Cesaro ended his partnership with Paul Heyman. In July 2014, WWE.com noted that one of Cesaro's signature moves, the Cesaro Swing, was \\"now a rarely used attraction\\" after previously being \\"a daily maneuver\\"; also that month, it was reported that WWE officials had told Cesaro to stop using the Cesaro Swing because it was making him too popular, and they did not want him being cheered as a heel. Without Heyman, Cesaro went on a losing streak, being defeated by Dean Ambrose, John Cena, Jack Swagger, Dolph Ziggler and finally Rob Van Dam at the SummerSlam pre-show. By defeating Van Dam in a rematch on Raw, Cesaro earned a United States title match against Sheamus, but lost again at Night of Champions in September. Instead, Cesaro switched his sights to another title, the Intercontinental Championship held by Dolph Ziggler, as Cesaro became number one contender after winning a battle royal. In September to November, Cesaro faced Ziggler in a title match on five occasions, on Raw, SmackDown and at Hell in a Cell, but lost every match, including three-way matches and a two-out-of-three falls match. Also in November, along with losses to Ryback and Erick Rowan and failing to win the United States title in a battle royal, Cesaro's tease of joining Team Cena for a Survivor Series match turned out to be a ruse. In a December 2014 interview, Stone Cold Steve Austin asked Vince McMahon why Cesaro had not gotten over yet and asked whether Cesaro was getting a proper push. McMahon replied that Cesaro was lacking in charisma, verbal skills, and the \\"it\\" factor, \\"might be because he's Swiss ... and the European style\\". McMahon concluded that he was not certain what could be done to restore Cesaro's momentum, but McMahon was not giving up. During the first half of 2015, Cesaro spent much of his time teaming with Tyson Kidd in pursuit of the WWE Tag Team Championship Cesaro began a tag team with Tyson Kidd on 1 December episode of Raw and were eliminated from a gauntlet match for a tag title shot by The Usos. They gained victories over Los Matadores and proceeded to ally with Adam Rose in a feud against The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) in January. On the Royal Rumble pre-show, Cesaro and Kidd defeated The New Day. Later that night, Cesaro entered the Rumble match at number 28, however, he was eliminated by Dolph Ziggler. At Fastlane on 22 February, Cesaro and Kidd defeated The Usos to capture the WWE Tag Team Championship. They retained their titles in a rematch the following night on Raw after their valet Natalya caused a disqualification. Cesaro and Kidd managed to retain their titles on the WrestleMania 31 pre-show in a fatal four-way tag team match. Cesaro also competed in the Andr√© the Giant memorial battle royal, but was eliminated by Big Show, whom Cesaro had eliminated the prior year. Cesaro and Kidd then reignited their feud against The New Day, where a double turn took place; Cesaro and Kidd turned face by displaying a fighting spirit, marking Cesaro's first ever face turn in the WWE, while The New Day turned heel by using underhanded tactics during their matches. At Extreme Rules, Cesaro and Kidd lost the Tag Team Championship to The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston), ending their reign at nine weeks. They failed to regain the championship on 30 April episode of SmackDown. and at Payback in a 2-out-of-3 falls match, with Xavier Woods interfering in both matches. At Elimination Chamber, Cesaro and Kidd competed in the first ever tag team Elimination Chamber match, but failed to win the titles. On 7 June, it was announced that Kidd had suffered a legitimate spinal injury and would be out of action for over a year.  Cesaro Section (2015‚Äì2016)  On 29 June episode of Raw, Cesaro answered John Cena's United States Championship open challenge and won by disqualification after Kevin Owens interfered and assaulted Cesaro. He unsuccessfully challenged Cena for the title again the next week on Raw in a match that was hailed as an 'instant classic', and that was later awarded the Slammy Award for \\"Best John Cena U.S. Open Challenge\\". After Raw went off the air, Cena praised Cesaro to the crowd, stating \\"Cesaro should be main eventing every night\\". On 13 July episode of Raw, Cesaro confronted Kevin Owens and Rusev about who should face Cena for the championship. This resulted in a triple threat match, where the winner would face Cena immediately after, which Rusev won. On 16 July episode of SmackDown, Cesaro became only the second man (after John Cena) to pin Rusev in a singles match. In the main event of 20 July episode of Raw, Cesaro teamed with John Cena and Randy Orton to defeat Sheamus, Kevin Owens, and Rusev. Cesaro was again attacked by Owens after losing a match to Seth Rollins on 23 July episode of SmackDown. Cesaro teamed up with Randy Orton to defeat Sheamus and Kevin Owens on 17 August episode of Raw. At SummerSlam, Cesaro was defeated by Owens in a singles match. Around this time, with Cesaro now firmly established as a fan favorite, the Cesaro Section phenomenon that originated in early 2014 again found traction, and home-made printed \\"Cesaro Section\\" signs again became circulated widely for fans to hold up during events to show their support for Cesaro. On 7 September episode of Raw, Cesaro faced The Miz in a match resulting in a double countout, after which he was knocked out by Big Show. In the Hell in a Cell kickoff show, Cesaro teamed up with Dolph Ziggler and Neville to defeat Rusev, Sheamus, and King Barrett. Cesaro defeated Sheamus on 9 November episode of Raw to advance to the quarterfinals in a tournament to crown a new WWE World Heavyweight Champion at Survivor Series after previous champion Seth Rollins injured his knee at a house show in Dublin, but lost to Roman Reigns in the semi-finals on 16 November. On 23 November, WWE announced that Cesaro needed surgery for a torn rotator cuff muscle in his left shoulder that had been injured for at least two months, and that would leave him out of action for four to six months. Cesaro stated in an interview that the injury would prevent him from competing at WrestleMania 32. Cesaro with \\"Cesaro Section\\" in 2016 Around the time of his injury, a number of prominent wrestling legends had increasingly been calling for the WWE to move Cesaro into a more significant role in the company. In the months prior, former champion Mick Foley voiced strong support for Cesaro, declaring the day after Cesaro's second United States Championship match with Cena in July that \\"Cesaro would make a great world-champion\\". Foley added in September that he was baffled by WWE's treatment of Cesaro, stating that if there was one change he could make to WWE it would simply be to \\"push Cesaro\\". Just days before the injury was announced, Ric Flair answered a question on who on the current roster he thought should have already been WWE World Heavyweight Champion by discussing how he thought Cesaro was \\"phenomenal\\" and that \\"nobody [brought] more to the table as a performer\\". Flair further stated that he thought Cesaro could be built up for a major storyline with Brock Lesnar within two months, suggesting for himself to become Cesaro's manager to help with his work on the microphone. Meanwhile, around the same time Stone Cold Steve Austin, a long time supporter of Cesaro, reiterated that he believed Cesaro had what was needed \\"to go up on top of the card\\" and blamed the WWE for not helping him more. Cesaro made his return from injury on the Raw after WrestleMania 32 on 4 April 2016 episode of Raw, introducing a new James Bond style entrance and attire to his character, including a tear-away business suit. He replaced Sami Zayn as a surprise entrant in the main event, a Fatal 4-Way match between himself, Kevin Owens, AJ Styles and Chris Jericho to determine the No. 1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, with the match being won by Styles. He then teamed with Styles to defeat Owens and Jericho in a tag team match on Smackdown. On 11 April edition of Raw, Cesaro defeated Kevin Owens to become the #1 contender for the Intercontinental Championship held by The Miz. At Payback, Cesaro failed to win the title after a distraction by Zayn and Owens, allowing Miz to retain the title. A Fatal 4-Way Intercontinental Championship match between Cesaro, Miz, Owens, and Zayn was then made for the Extreme Rules pay-per-view on 22 May. The Miz ultimately prevailed by pinning Cesaro after Zayn executed a Helluva Kick on Cesaro. The following night on Raw Cesaro defeated Miz for a spot in the Money in the Bank ladder match. On the following episode Smackdown, The Miz retained the title against Cesaro. At Money in the Bank, Cesaro was unsuccessful as the match was won by Dean Ambrose. The Bar (2016‚Äì2019)  On 19 July at the 2016 WWE draft, Cesaro was drafted to Raw. Afterwards, while being interviewed live on the WWE Network by JoJo, Cesaro legitimately complained about how he should have been drafted \\"at least top 10\\" and thought he would be a better fit on the more wrestling-oriented SmackDown brand, as well as criticizing the decision to have the storyline focus on the potential drama between Stephanie McMahon and Raw General Manager Mick Foley as opposed to the wrestlers themselves. While WWE would eventually continue this as part of an angle, Dave Meltzer confirmed on Twitter that the interview was a shoot and that Cesaro had unexpectedly gone off-script. After the draft, Cesaro would then begin a rivalry with Sheamus, he defeated Sheamus in two consecutive matches, resulting in Cesaro earning a championship match for the United States Championship, which he received on 8 August episode of Raw against Rusev, but lost after interference from Sheamus. The following week, Mick Foley announced that the pair would face each other in a Best of Seven Series, with the first match taking place on 21 August on the SummerSlam kick-off show, which Sheamus won. Sheamus would defeat Cesaro in the second and third matches, but Cesaro defeated Sheamus in the fourth, fifth and sixth match, tying the series 3-3. At Clash of Champions, Cesaro fought Sheamus to a no-contest when neither man could continue, leaving the outcome of their series undecided. The next night on Raw, Mick Foley decided to make the two partners to receive a future Raw Tag Team Championship opportunity. Later that night, they defeated a few local athletes, but still did not seem to be seeing eye to eye. Cesaro and Sheamus defeated The New Day on 24 October episode of Raw and defeated them by disqualification at Hell in a Cell. On 7 November episode of Raw, Cesaro and Sheamus were announced as part of Team Raw for the 10‚Äìon‚Äì10 Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match at Survivor Series on 20 November, which Team Raw won with Cesaro and Sheamus being the sole survivors of their team. The next night on Raw, Cesaro and Sheamus again failed to capture Raw Tag Team Championship from The New Day. After hinting at a break-up, the pair got into a bar brawl with men who offended them and finally began to cooperate with each other. They received another title shot at Roadblock: End of the Line, where Cesaro and Sheamus finally defeated The New Day to win the Raw Tag Team Championship, marking Cesaro's second reign. On 29 January 2017 on the Royal Rumble kickoff show, Cesaro and Sheamus lost the Raw Tag Team Championship to Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, and failed to regain them after The Hardy Boyz won the title at WrestleMania 33. Cesaro (left) and Sheamus in May 2017 The following night on Raw, Cesaro and Sheamus defeated Enzo Amore and Big Cass to become the number one contender's for the Raw Tag Team Championship at Payback. At Payback, after failing to regain the title, both Cesaro and Sheamus turned heel by attacking The Hardy Boyz. From there, now known as \\"The Bar\\", their entrances became further synchronized as they wore the same attire into the ring. They then won a tag team turmoil to earn another opportunity for the tag title at Extreme Rules. The match was made a steel cage match after Matt Hardy defeated Sheamus on 22 May episode of Raw in a match where the winner chose the stipulation for their Extreme Rules bout. At the event, The Bar defeated The Hardy Boyz to win the Raw Tag Team Championship for the second time, making Cesaro a three-time champion. The duo made their first televised defense of the title against The Hardy Boyz on 12 June episode of Raw in a two out of three falls match where the two teams tied at 1-1 after being counted out.

The Bar lost the Raw Tag Team Championship to Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose at SummerSlam. The Bar lost their rematch for the title to Rollins and Ambrose at No Mercy, during which Cesaro lost his two front teeth following a throw into the turnbuckle by Ambrose. Cesaro continued to fight despite blood coming out of his mouth and eventually taking a Brogue Kick from Sheamus (as part of a scripted miscue between the two), earning critical praise from fans and fellow wrestlers for his toughness. WWE released a statement on Cesaro's medical condition stating that his teeth had been pushed up into his upper jaw by about 3 to 4 mm and that he would next go to see a maxillofacial surgeon. They teamed with The Miz, Braun Strowman and Kane against The Shield and Kurt Angle who replaced Roman Reigns after he wasn't medically cleared to compete in a five-on-three TLC match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in a losing effort. On 6 November episode of Raw, the duo regained their titles from Rollins and Ambrose, winning the title for the third time.

Raw Tag Team Champions at WrestleMania 34 On 28 January 2018, The Bar won back the title at Royal Rumble, becoming record four-time champions as a team, and a record fifth reign for Cesaro individually.

On 12 March episode of Raw, Braun Strowman won a tag team battle royale to determine the number one contenders for their tag titles at WrestleMania 34 although he lacked a partner, Raw General Manager Kurt Angle still allowed Strowman to wrestle for the titles, under the provision that he reveal his mystery partner at the event. At the event, Strowman revealed his partner to be a 10-year-old fan called Nicholas. The Bar were defeated by Strowman and Nicholas, therefore losing the tag team title and in turn making Nicholas the youngest champion of any kind in WWE history. On 17 April, as part of the 2018 WWE Superstar Shake-up, Cesaro and Sheamus were both drafted to SmackDown. Despite the trade, they still had an opportunity to win the Raw Tag Team Championship as they faced Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt at Greatest Royal Rumble event, but failed to win the WWE RAW Tag Team Championship. The Bar entered a brief feud with The New Day, losing to them and failing to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match.

At the Raw following WrestleMania, The Bar interrupted a match between Seth Rollins and Kofi Kingston, resulting in a tag team match. This resulted in \\"bullshit\\", \\"AEW\\" and \\"CM Punk\\" chants from the crowd, voicing their displeasure in the match they were given instead. The next day on SmackDown, Sheamus reportedly suffered a concussion in a six-man tag team match with New Day. Cesaro was drafted to Raw a few weeks later, and it was not addressed if Sheamus would follow him there. Artist Collective (2019‚Äìpresent) On 20 May episode of Raw, Cesaro debuted a new entrance theme and titantron separate from The Bar as he defeated Ricochet.

Professional wrestling style and persona  Cesaro performing the \\"Giant Swing\\" during a house show in January 2015 Cesaro is widely considered one of the best performers in professional wrestling, despite never getting a true main event run. His wrestling ability has been praised by fellow wrestlers and wrestling icons such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mick Foley, and Jim Ross. In 2019, Bleacher Report called him one of the best \\"pure wrestlers\\" in WWE. Criticism has been levied at WWE for underutilizing Cesaro creatively on their shows. Later in his career, he became known as a \\"tag team specialist\\" due to his successful partnerships with Jack Swagger, Tyson Kidd, Sheamus, and Shinsuke Nakamura. He had also received praise for his pre-WWE tag teams with Chris Hero and Bryan Danielson. Cesaro uses a no-nonsense, European style as the basis for his move set. He uses the Gotch Neutralizer (a belly-to-back inverted mat slam) and Very European Uppercut (a pop-up European uppercut) as finishing moves. He also uses the Cesaro Swing (a giant swing), albeit less frequently. A big part of his wrestling style comes from his strength, which he has showcased by lifting heavier wrestlers such as The Great Khali, Brodus Clay, and Big Show, all of whom outweigh him by at least 100 lb (45.3 kg). He has been credited as one of the strongest wrestlers in WWE. His technical ability is also notable, and he has utilized the sharpshooter (adopted from his former tag team partner Kidd) as a signature move since 2015. During an interview in 2013, Cesaro cited Bruno Sammartino, Bob Backlund, Dave Finlay, Dave Taylor, William Regal, and Karl Gotch as his influences.

He enjoys cooking and is a coffee aficionado, having run a blog and YouTube channel called Claudio's Caf√© in his pre-WWE days. Claudio's Caf√© is now the name of his secondary Instagram page, on which he documents his visits to coffee shops worldwide.https://www.instagram.com/claudioscafe/ He is also an animal lover, and a fan of James Bond (which he incorporated into his WWE gimmick from 2016 to 2018) and Star Wars. He has said that he prides himself on holding high personal values and presenting himself as a professional in both his personal and work life, elaborating in July 2015, \\"Older values of older times, that are not as much around anymore, are still very important to me. [...] You have to be a professional in every single thing you do.\\" Noted for his exceptional strength and stating that he is \\"100% natural\\", Castagnoli describes his training regime as \\"kind of a mix\\", with particular focus on CrossFit and variations of Olympic weightlifting. He has stated that he continually tries to learn new ways to workout in order to keep improving. He has performed a one-arm snatch with 145 lbs (66 kg), a one-arm clean and jerk with 135 lbs (61 kg), (on phone with Natalya Neidhart) and comfortably performed a two-arm clean and jerk with 286 lbs (130 kg). Castagnoli and former tag team partner Tyson Kidd have said that, despite being paired up by WWE without their input, they subsequently became close friends in real life.  Other media  Castagnoli made a brief appearance in the 2008 drama film The Wrestler. He regularly appeared on the WWE web series The JBL and Cole Show until its cancellation in June 2015. He has also made brief appearances on the E! show Total Divas.

The trio increased in size to a five- or six-piece group for live shows; these line-ups frequently included drummer Jason Sakos and guitarist Trevor Shand. Buhler and Crooker were in another female-fronted band in the mid-1990s, Sirensong. After the demise of this band, Buhler's then-wife Cynthia von Buhler (n√©e Carrozza), with whom Adam co-owned Castle von Buhler Records, introduced him and Crooker to singer Kaplan, who had previously been a back-up singer for Cynthia's band Women of Sodom. With Cynthia as their manager, Splashdown was formed in 1996, playing their first live show on March 29, and their 7-inch vinyl record Pandora / Deserter was released the same year. Their first full-length album, Stars and Garters, came in 1997, featuring nine tracks, including \\"Pandora\\" and \\"Deserter\\". That same year, the track \\"50%\\" appeared on Nigh, a compilation album released by Castle von Buhler. This was followed by the Halfworld EP in 1998, which contained four new songs and a reworked version of the Stars and Garters track \\"Beguiled\\", entitled \\"Beguiled Mark II\\". After their initial studio and tour success, Splashdown was signed to Glen Ballard's Java Records, an imprint of Capitol Records, which released a five-track EP in 1999, Redshift, that quickly sold out. Yet for reasons largely unknown, although troubles between Ballard and Capitol are partially to blame, Capitol never released their next full-length album, Blueshift. This album, co- produced by the band and engineer Bryan Carrigan and featuring two songs co- written by Ballard, included the five songs on Redshift, five old songs with new mixes that did not appear on Redshift (including \\"Games You Play\\", a reworking of the Stars and Garters song \\"Paradox\\"), and six all-new songs. The problems Splashdown endured with Capitol prompted the band to independently compile another full-length album, Possibilities, which included demos and previously released work that was not owned by Capitol. Around this time, members of Splashdown's mailing list received notice that any orders from their online store would include a free \\"bonus item,\\" which was not specified in any further detail. A few days later, emails began returning from fans that indicated the bonus item was a copy of Blueshift, burned on a CD-R with a white label and plain text track listing. Blueshift and Possibilities are now widely available from numerous download sites. Unfortunately, fearing Capitol would own any future songs and lacking energy after their fight with their label, the band members announced in 2001 that they were on an \\"indefinite hiatus\\" and later stated that their time as Splashdown had ended. While they were together, the band played on the second stage at many shows on the East Coast leg of the Lilith Fair tour in 1999. One of their songs, \\"Karma Slave,\\" was featured on the soundtrack to the film Titan AE. Many of Splashdown's fans credit the Lilith Fair gigs and \\"Karma Slave\\" for helping them discover the band. In addition, the song \\"A Charming Spell\\" was featured on an episode of the TV show Charmed, and \\"Games You Play\\" was heard in an episode of Angel. The band's music also appeared in Ballard's movie Clubland. Splashdown gained some fame from airplay on a number of college and alternative radio stations, including WBCN in Boston (in 1997, the band participated in the WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble) and WOXY in Cincinnati. However, they were most popular on WBER in Rochester, New York; on that station's year-end countdowns of top songs as voted on by listeners, \\"Ironspy\\" was ranked fifth in 1999, while \\"Mayan Pilot\\" was fourth and \\"A Charming Spell\\" tied for eighteenth in 2000.WBER's top 100 songs of 2000 as voted by our listeners In addition, Splashdown once headlined the city's Lilac Festival, and when the band held a contest in 1999 to see who could sell the most Splashdown albums to their friends, all three of the top finishers were from Rochester.  Post-break-up work  After Splashdown's break-up, Kaplan formed another band, Universal Hall Pass, which in 2004 released its first album, Mercury, and a six-song EP, entitled Subtle Things, in the last week of 2006. Kaplan is technically the only member of UHP. The first live Universal Hall Pass performance, on March 13, 2006, consisted solely of Kaplan and a piano. She has also sung on many film soundtracks, including K-PAX, Pretty Persuasion, The Chronicles of Riddick, The Skeleton Key, and Red Planet, among others.IMDb Many of the movies in which her voice is heard were scored by Graeme Revell. Buhler produced and played bass on Boston band Sparkola's self-titled 2002 debut album and 2003 EP Handclaps & Slapbacks (both released on the Castle von Buhler label). Buhler, who at one point recorded with the darkwave band Black Tape for a Blue Girl before Splashdown's formation, is now half of the hard-rock duo Anarchy Club with Keith Smith, previously the lead singer of fellow Boston-area band C60. Their first album, The Way And Its Power, was released in 2005, and an EP followed in 2007, called \\"A Single Drop of Red.\\" In late 2009, they released another full-length CD, \\"The Art of War.\\" Anarchy Club's music has been featured as playable tracks in the best-selling games Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 2, Rock Band, and Rock Band 2. In late 2010, he released a new CD under the name Map & Key, with music by Adam and singing by Scottish singer Alice Ishbel Watson. Their collaboration was conducted via Internet between America and Scotland. Crooker went on to co-found Freezepop (who, as noted above, released their first album while Splashdown was still technically together) and continues to do solo work as Symbion Project, a moniker under which he has recorded since 1992. He and Kaplan recently worked together on Universal Hall Pass's \\"Subtle Things\\" EP. Crooker is also the Audio Director at Harmonix, makers of such hit music-heavy video games as FreQuency, Amplitude, and the Guitar Hero series. As most Harmonix-developed games are published by Konami, Crooker has also worked on some North American entries in that company's Dance Dance Revolution series. In addition to many Symbion Project and Freezepop songs being placed in these games (with many of Crooker's songs being attributed to aliases), Kaplan was heard in both Frequency and Amplitude.  Music distribution  When Splashdown was together in the late 1990s at the height of the popularity of file-sharing programs such as Napster, they discouraged online sharing of their songs. After the band's break-up, however, Splashdown and their fans made efforts to ensure their music was available for free online. The band's entire catalog is still available for download for free on the web, though remastered versions of their first two (pre-Capitol) releases are also available on iTunes.

Because of human agricultural reliance in many parts of the world on animals which digest by enteric fermentation, it is one of the factors in increased methane emissions. Ruminants Ruminant animals are those that have a rumen. A rumen is a multichambered stomach found almost exclusively among some artiodactyl mammals, such cattle, deer, and camels, enabling them to eat cellulose-enhanced tough plants and grains that monogastric (i.e., \\"single-chambered stomached\\") animals, such as humans, dogs, and cats, cannot digest. Enteric fermentation occurs when methane (CH4) is produced in the rumen as microbial fermentation takes place. Over 200 species of microorganisms are present in the rumen, although only about 10% of these play an important role in digestion. Most of the CH4 byproduct is belched by the animal, however, a small percentage of CH4 is also produced in the large intestine and passed out as flatulence. Methane emissions are an important contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC reports that methane is more than twenty times as effective as CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere - though note that it is produced in substantially smaller amounts. Methane represents also a significant energy loss to the animal ranging from 2 to 12% of gross energy intake. So, decreasing the production of enteric CH4 from ruminants without altering animal production is desirable both as a strategy to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and as a means of improving feed conversion efficiency. In Australia ruminant animals account for over half of their green house gas contribution from methane.Australian Greenhouse Office, \\"National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\\", Canberra ACT, March 2007. Australia has implemented a voluntary immunization program for cattle in order to help reduce flatulence-produced CH4. However, in Australia there are ruminant species of the kangaroos that are able to produce 80% less methane than cows. This is because the gut microbiota of Macropodids, rumen and others parts of their digestive system, is dominated by bacteria of the family Succinivibrionaceae. These bacteria are able to produce succinate as a final product of the lignocelluloses degradation, producing small amounts of methane as end product. Its special metabolic route allows it to utilize others proton acceptors, avoiding the formation of methane.Isolation of Succinivibrionaceae Implicated in Low Methane Emissions from Tammar Wallabies P. B. Pope, Science 333, 646 (2011) Experimental management Enteric fermentation was the second largest anthropogenic source of methane emissions in the United States from 2000 through 2009.Executive Summary - Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2009 - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, April, 2011; available at: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads11/US- GHG-Inventory-2011-Executive-Summary.pdf In 2007, methane emissions from enteric fermentation were 2.5% of net greenhouse gases produced in the United States at 139 teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalents (Tg CO2) out of a total net emission of 5618 Tg CO2.Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2007 - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, April, 2009; available at: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads09/ExecutiveSummary.pdf For this reason, scientists believe that, with the aid of microbial engineering, the use of microbioma to modify natural or anthropogenic processes, we could change the microbiota composition of the rumen of strong methane producers, emulating the Macropodidae microbiota. Recent studies claim that this technique is possible to perform. In one of these studies scientists analyze the changes of human microbiota by different alimentary changes. In other study, researchers introduce a human microbiota in gnotobiotic mice in order to compare the different changes for developing new ways to manipulate the properties of the microbiota so as to prevent or treat various diseases. Asparagopsis taxiformis is a species of algae that can substantially reduce methane emissions when added to cattle feed.

He is particularly noted for associations with Commodore Business Machines and the Toronto PET Users Group, for many books and articles on machine language programming, and for educational videos and TV programs.  Early life and career  Jim Butterfield was born on 14 February 1936 in Ponoka, Alberta, which is south of Edmonton. He was the third of four children to James and Nancy Butterfield, who had immigrated from England to farm. In 1953 he won a French scholarship to the Banff School of Fine Arts. He later attended the University of Alberta and the University of British Columbia but dropped out due to lack of interest. One of his first jobs was radio continuity writing in Alberta. In 1957, Butterfield began working for Canadian National/Canadian Pacific Telecommunications, at first as a microwave technician trainer in Whitehorse. In 1959 Popular Electronics Magazine. published his article simplifying then new transistors for the hobbyist. In 1962 he was transferred to Toronto, and within a year was programming CN/CP's mainframe computers. Butterfield left CN/CP in 1981, allegedly for telling his boss that personal computers would wipe out the wire teleprinter business, though Butterfield stated that he quit voluntarily after the company relocated too far from central Toronto to make commuting worthwhile. He became a full-time freelance writer, programmer, and speaker.  Computing career  In May 1976 Butterfield became intensely interested in microcomputers, purchasing a MOS KIM-1 and eventually coauthoring a book about the machine. He soon published games and applications for many computers, and became a regular contributor, and in some cases a columnist or associate editor, for computer magazines such as COMPUTE!, COMPUTE!'s Gazette, The Transactor, and Printout. Several more books followed, including Machine Language Programming for the Commodore 64 and Other Commodore Computers, a leading reference on 6510 programming which went through several editions. Butterfield's writing was praised as being \\"informal and witty in spite of its technical content\\", and so endeared him to Commodore users that The Transactor once included a centrefold of a (clothed) Butterfield. Butterfield helped found the Toronto PET Users Group (TPUG), and was the invited speaker at its first meeting in 1979. His reputation as a speaker and educator grew, and people would drive hundreds of kilometres to early TPUG meetings to hear him speak. Butterfield gave speeches at science conferences and computer expos around the world; in Europe he was hailed as the \\"Commodore Pope\\". Commodore contracted him to tour in support of its new VIC-20 computer and later to produce training videos for the Commodore 64. In 1983, Butterfield appeared as the resident expert in the TVOntario educational series The Academy; the show served as a companion to Bits and Bytes, for which he was already the main source of technical content and author of the accompanying resource book. That year Butterfield and co-host Jack Livesley appeared at Commodore's inaugural World of Commodore show. During the 1980s, Butterfield continued his association with TPUG, teaching a machine language course there and at George Brown College. He continued to hold regular classes and seminars at TPUG meetings, World of Commodore shows, and other events until his death. For those who could not attend in person, Butterfield accepted telephone calls every day from 10:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M., receiving hundreds of questions every week. He also had a significant presence in the online communities of the day, holding regular Q&A; sessions on services such as Q-Link and GEnie. Butterfield also wrote about non-Commodore computers, such as the Atari 8-bit version of Microsoft BASIC. An early advocate of free and source-available software, Butterfield authored a quarter of the about 80 programs which began the TPUG software library. Much of his software appeared as type-in programs in the magazines for which he was a columnist or associate editor. Among the best-known were SuperMon and TinyMon, two machine language monitors that many assembly language programmers used to debug and test code. Butterfield's only commercially marketed program was SpellPro, a spell checker for Steve Punter's popular WordPro word processor.  Death and legacy  In a November 2006 newsgroup message, Butterfield announced that he was undergoing chemotherapy. He died at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto on 29 June 2007. The death was announced the following day on the comp.sys.cbm newsgroup, and later in Toronto Star and Edmonton Journal obituaries. Numerous tributes to Butterfield were published online and in the mainstream and computing press. The Globe and Mail dedicated a \\"Lives Lived\\" column to him in August 2007, and the Winter 2007 issue of the TPUG Newsletter featured dozens of biographies, eulogies, and tributes. Memorials were held at the Naval Club of Toronto on 22 September, including a tribute video by computer historian Syd Bolton, and at the World of Commodore 2007 expo on 1 December.  Personal life  PET Butterfield and his family lived near downtown Toronto. In his spare time he enjoyed gardening, playing the piano, caring for his many cats, socializing at the Naval Club of Toronto, and exploring downtown Toronto and the many cities he visited. His wife, Vicki Butterfield, was not a computer enthusiast, but was an active Rhinoceros Party member who ran for office in Toronto. In 1988, the couple had a daughter, Susannah.

He is considered a pioneering contributor to the field of Aerodynamics.  Biography  = First years, education = Carafoli was of Macedo-Romanian (Aromanian) descent. In 1915, he left Greece for Bitola, and then Bucharest, where he studied at Gheorghe LazƒÉr High School. In 1919 he entered University Politehnica of Bucharest, graduating with a degree in electrical engineering. He pursued his studies at the University of Paris, while also working at the Institut A√©rotechnique in Saint-Cyr-l'√âcole, France. He obtained a Ph.D. in 1928, with a thesis entitled Contribution to the theory of aerodynamic lift. = Activity in Romania = In 1928, Carafoli returned to Bucharest, where he joined the faculty at the Polytechnic University, and founded the Aerodynamics chair; later in 1936 he was promoted to full professor. It was here that he built the first wind tunnel in South-Eastern Europe, and elaborated some of the theory on which calculations of wing profiles of supersonic aircraft are based.\\"Technical Sciences\\", at the Romanian Academy From 1930 to 1937 Carafoli worked at Industria AeronauticƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ in Bra≈üov. Together with Luci√©n Virmoux from Bl√©riot A√©ronautique, he designed the IAR CV-11, a single-seat, low-wing monoplane fighter aircraft. A prototype was flown in 1931 by Captain Romeo Popescu, in an attempt at breaking the flight airspeed record, but the plane crashed, and the pilot lost his life. Carafoli also designed the IAR 14 and IAR 15 aircraft, and later in 1937 initiated the development of the legendary IAR 80 fighter aircraft, at the urging of Prime Minister Armand CƒÉlinescu.

It is the P 16, MH 334 - Symphony No. 25 in G major by Michael Haydn with an Adagio maestoso composed and added by Mozart as an introduction. Mozart's added introduction led to the misattribution of the entire symphony being his original work.  History  The complete symphony was for a long time believed to be a work by Mozart, but is now known to have actually been mostly written by Michael Haydn, being his Symphony No. 25 in G major, Perger 16, Sherman 25, MH 334. The true authorship was discovered by Lothar Perger in 1907. Modern commentators find it \\"difficult to comprehend how the editors of the Breitkopf edition of Mozart could have considered the three movements of the G major Symphony as the immediate successor of the 'Linz' Symphony; the infinitely simpler and more archaic art of the Salzburg master offers such a contrast that one might well suppose this symphony to date much earlier than 1783\\" if Mozart had been the one to write it.Saint- Foix, Georges de. The Symphonies of Mozart, transl. Leslie Orrey. London: Dennis Dobson Ltd.

Kassel: B√§renreiter 2005, , p. 307 Mozart's Adagio maestoso introduction in triple time ends with a fermata on a V7 chord, which leads into a tonic chord beginning Haydn's work. Georges de Saint-Foix considers the introduction \\"an expressive prelude, which, moreover, is by no means entirely in key with the movement it is intended to prepare.\\"Saint-Foix, Georges de.

The numbers for Mozart's Symphonies Nos. 38 through 41 have not been adjusted because of this symphony. According to the Breitkopf & H√§rtel edition, the score calls for flute, 2 oboes, 2 horns and strings; performances tend to include bassoons (always in unison with the celli except for significant passages in the adagio), which were part of Michael Haydn's original score but left out by Mozart, and a harpsichord playing figured bass, based on the cello line.

Poenaru, who had studied in Paris and Vienna and, later, completed his specialized studies in England, was a mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, teacher and organizer of the educational system, as well as a politician, agronomist, and zootechnologist, founder of the Philharmonic Society, the Botanical Gardens and the National Museum of Antiquities in Bucharest. While a student in Paris, Petrache Poenaru invented the world's first fountain pen, an invention for which the French Government issued a patent on 25 May 1827.  Biography  He was born in 1799 in BƒÉne≈üti, V√¢lcea County, in the northwestern part of Wallachia. His uncle, Iordache Oteteli≈üanu, was one of the promoters of an institutionalized educational system, in a time when a great part of the population was illiterate. Poenaru attended the secondary school Obedeanu in Craiova and worked as a copyist at the office of the bishop of R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea. Later on, between 1820 and 1821, he taught Greek at the Metropolitan School in Bucharest. In 1821, the Revolution led by Tudor Vladimirescu began. At that time, Wallachia was under Ottoman domination and was ruled by the Phanariots (Greeks originating from Constantinople and very loyal to the Sultan), who burdened the country with numerous taxes and an expensive and corrupt court. Tudor Vladimirescu gathered an army of Oltenian soldiers called panduri and moved towards Bucharest to overthrow them. He was joined by many and, among them, was the young Petrache Poenaru. During his first skirmish, he proved he didn‚Äôt have any fighting abilities and his comrades took him in front of the revolution‚Äôs leader, for punishment. But Vladimirescu was impressed by the young man‚Äôs educated spirit and sharp mind and made him his personal assistant. From this position, he elaborated the army‚Äôs manifesto, now considered one of the first Romanian newspapers. Poenaru was lucky enough not to be around Tudor Vladimirescu when the leader was lured in a trap and assassinated, as he was sent in a diplomatic mission to advocate the Romanian cause to the representatives of the great powers, Russia, Austria or England. After news of Vladimirescu‚Äôs death spread, he took refuge in Sibiu. When the political situation improved, he was able to earn a scholarship to study in Vienna, in 1822. There, he learnt about measuring tools and micrometers, unknown to the underdeveloped Romanian engineering field and discovered a great appetite for technical sciences, while also fervently studying Greek, Latin, French, Italian and English. In a letter sent to his family, he confessed that he thought the sweetest pleasure a man can experience is learning. In 1824, the Wallachian ruler Grigore Ghica granted him another scholarship, which compelled Poenaru to return to the country after the studies ended and share his acquired knowledge as a teacher.  Poenaru's fountain pen  Postage stamp commemorating Poenaru's invention In 1826 he went to France and attended the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris, where he studied geodesy and surveying. He was so busy taking notes and copying courses, that he invented a fountain pen that used a swan's quill as an ink reservoir. On 25 May 1827, the Manufacture Department of the French Ministry of the Interior registered Poenaru‚Äôs invention with the code number 3208 and the description \\"plume portable sans fin, qui s‚Äôalimente elle-meme avec de l‚Äôancre\\" (\\"never-ending portable pen, which recharges itself with ink\\"). In 2010 Po»ôta Rom√¢nƒÉ issued a 5 lei stamp depicting Poenaru next to his fountain pen project.

The most common use for mixed mode CDs is to add CD-quality audio to video games on a CD. The term \\"enhanced CD\\" is sometimes used to refer to mixed mode CDs,Enhanced CD Formats though it is most commonly used to refer to either a more general category of formats that mix audio and data tracks, or to the particular Enhanced Music CD format. Overview Mixed mode CDs are implicitly described in the original CD-ROM standard (the Yellow Book, later standardized as ISO/IEC 10149 and ECMA-130), which allows a CD-ROM to contain only data tracks, or data tracks and audio tracks. The CD-ROM standard, however, does not mention the term \\"mixed mode\\", nor does it describe any particular order of data and audio tracks on the disc. Since the original CD-ROM standard did not support multiple sessions, mixed mode CDs are created using only one session. Some CD players manufactured prior to the mid-to-late-1990s have trouble with the mixed mode CD format because the first track, which contains data, might be \\"played\\", resulting in screeching which, at worst, might damage speakers. This is caused by the player not recognizing the \\"data\\" flag bit for the track that distinguishes it from an audio track; these players were designed for audio CDs only, with no provisions to handle CD-ROMs with both data and audio tracks. As a result, it attempts to play back the data file as an audio recording, converting the encoded data into incongruous noise that can exceed the limitations of commercial speakers. Newer audio CD players do check for data tracks and (at least) mute the track if it contains data and not audio. Several newer formats were created to improve the usability of CDs with audio and data tracks in audio CD players; these formats include CD-i, CD-i Ready, and Enhanced CDs (both Blue Book-standard and non-standard enhanced CDs). In the case of the latter, audio tracks are placed in one session before the data tracks, which are stored in a second session. This avoids the problem with the data track for most audio players, since they will only be able to recognize the first session. Use in video games Most games released for the Sega CD/Mega-CD and NEC PC Engine CD/TurboGrafx CD are mixed mode CDs. Several games for the PC, Amiga, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Dreamcast are mixed mode CDs as well. Games ported from floppy disk or cartridge media to a CD would often have the music replaced with (Red Book) audio CD tracks, using the mixed-mode format. As an alternative, some games embed video and audio in CD- ROM data files and tend not to use CD audio tracks in the game, usually taking advantage of XA interleaving. This was the norm for (including Full-motion video (FMV) games, as the CD drive speed and system RAM size were not adequate to pre-load the video from the disc completely into RAM before playing it, so it had to be played (streamed) directly from the disc, and the CD drive could not read two tracks (a data track containing the video, and an audio track) at the same time.Note: CD audio decoding and playback hardware was normally built into the CD-ROM drive itself, so it was not possible to read the CD audio into RAM and play it back using the CPU or a peripheral audio chip apart from the CD drive. In most 20th century CD-multimedia consoles and computer systems, the CPU did not even have at its disposal a DAC capable of CD audio sampling quality, so the only way to play the audio from a CD audio track was to have the CD-ROM drive play it in the same way that an audio CD player would. (This is definitely the case in the Sega CD system and in IBM-compatible multimedia PCs conforming to the MPC standard.) A short Redbook audio track was sometimes included with non-mixed-mode games anyway, so that when these discs are played in a CD player, the player will reproduce a recorded warning announcement, typically stating that the disc is not meant to be run in an audio CD player before instructing the listener to eject the disc immediately. Bonus audio tracks might also be included on the disc as Easter eggs for the player to find when the game software is not running.An example is the last track on the Sewer Shark pack-in game CD for the Sega CD, which is a sort of audio \\"vanity plate\\" for Digital Pictures, the producers of the game.

On 14 July 2016, Planet Mu announced that a reissued version would be released with seven bonus tracks in September 2016. Production Mike Paradinas described the sound of the album as \\"an updated version of easy listening and funk\\". James had heard the music Paradinas had made under the name of Jake Slazenger and invited him to create tracks. Paradinas noted James had invited other artists to collaborate with him, including Luke Vibert, Squarepusher and Cylob and was honoured that his collaborative tracks were chosen for the release. Both artists were getting drunk while developing tracks, something that Paradinas stated that neither artist regularly did. The track \\"Giant Deflating Football\\" was written during the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Paradinas noted that the two \\"were able to quite quickly write a large amount of material. \\"Giant Deflating Football\\" is named because it had some quite weird percussion sounds made by scraping and blowing in a microphone. It sounded like a big wheezing football. We took a bit of acid afterwards to listen to it, and we were coming out with some imagery like 'Beady Eyes', which is mentioned in one of the tracks.\\" Release Milton Bradley game Downfall, whilst also parodying the box art of the original game. Expert Knob Twiddlers was released by Rephlex Records on June 24, 1996 on audio cassette, compact disc and vinyl. Paradinas felt the album should have been released as early as 1994, stating that \\"At that time, that style was something that no one else had done [...] It wasn't like anything anyone heard before really. By the time it did come out, a lot of things came out like Lisa Carbon Trio aka Lisa Carbon aka Lisa Carbon & Friends (band has albums on different listings) and there was a lot of revived interest in easy listening. Neither of us was prepared for it.\\" On July 19 2016, the song \\"Vodka (Mix 2)\\" was released with the announcement of the album's 2016 reissue. The original version of this album was known by both Mike & Rich as just simply \\"Mike & Rich\\" and not \\"Expert Knob Twiddlers\\" which it is known by their fans. When the reissue was released they eventually just listed it as \\"Expert Knob Twiddlers\\". Reception The Guardian gave the album three stars, calling it \\"a lovingly kitsch collaboration\\" and that the album \\"might easily have been a loathsomely ironic exercise.\\" stating that the track \\"Mr. Frosty\\" made the album \\"worth owning\\". The review concluded that \\"much of the rest is indulgent piffle.\\" AllMusic gave the album four stars, while noting that the mixed styles of James and Paradinas \\"cancels out the particular attractions of both artists, and the listener is left with a somewhat bland album.

History Moses Bensinger was influential in setting up the American Bowling Congress (A.B.C.) in 1895. On September 9, 1895, the A.B.C. was officially formed as a permanent organization at Beethoven Hall on east Fifth Street in New York City. The A.B.C. had their first formal annual meeting four days later on September 13 at the Elephant club on Fulton Street in Brooklyn and adopted the proposed constitution and by-laws. The new organization took effect officially on October 15, 1895. It is a legislative body that enforces uniform bowlers' rules and regulations, through a set of by-laws and a constitution of Articles, for all in the United States to follow as the official standard for ten-pin bowling. Before the USBC's existence, the A.B.C. standardized and governed all tenpin bowling equipment as well for the modern sport, through to the time of consolidation under the USBC. It is much like the baseball National League and the Bicycle law in the United States. This was a codification of the preexisting rules and regulations through the by-laws of the American Bowling Congress. It eliminated gambling on contests, as prize money could now be earned honestly in tournaments. This was done by a uniform method of scoring that was enforceable by the A.B.C. bowling laws that then made it fair for all bowlers throughout the United States. Bowling equipment made by the Brunswick Company, like the alleys, pins and balls, were uniform based on certain measurements and requirements set in place by the American Bowling Congress. All the large national bowling centers with regulation Brunswick equipment - and much later, in the era of the automatic pinspotter, the AMF firm - were under the constitution and by-laws of the A.B.C. organization by 1905. Historically, the membership of the ABC was all male (white males only in 1916‚Äì1950), but beginning in 1993 women were permitted to join. In 1916 the Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) was formed by a group of 40 women, and up until 2004 served as a partner organization of the ABC. The Young American Bowling Alliance (YABA) was established in 1982, after previously existing as the American Junior Bowling Congress founded in 1958, to serve youth bowlers from pre-school through collegiate level. Prior to the formation of the USBC, the national governing body for bowling was USA Bowling, which oversaw the participation of Team USA in international events. These four organizations merged to form USBC on January 1, 2005. USBC Hall of Fame The USBC Hall of FameUnited States Bowling Congress Hall of Fame official webpage. USBC website.

The 2013, 2014 and 2015 events were all won by Australian Jason Belmonte, who became the only player in history to win this tournament in three consecutive years. Belmonte's streak was broken in 2016 by American 19-year-old Anthony Simonsen, who made history as the youngest-ever winner of a PBA major tournament. Belmonte won the 2017 event for an unprecedented fourth Masters title. The most recent champion, crowned on April 1, 2019, is American Jakob Butturff of Chandler, Arizona. The USBC Queens, one of four major tournaments on the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) Tour, is conducted by the USBC. The 2019 event was won by Ukrainian-born Dasha Kovalova, who bowled collegiately at Wichita State University. The USBC Intercollegiate Team Championships, a.k.a. ITC, the national championship of collegiate bowling, is conducted by USBC and has been televised on a tape-delay basis since 2002.Official ITC webpage For the first time, in 2012, USBC also televised the Intercollegiate Singles Championships as part of a four-week series on CBS Sports Network.Official ISC webpage Both events were televised in high definition for the first time in 2012. USBC was the presenting sponsor of the PBA Women's Series for three seasons, beginning with the 2007-08 season. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, USBC changed the name of its presenting sponsorship to BOWL.com, the organization's website, which was re-launched on August 3, 2009. USBC did not renew its sponsorship for the 2010‚Äì11 season.USBC press release In 2007, USBC acquired the rights to the U.S. Women's Open from the Bowling Proprietors' Association of America (BPAA). The event, which had been on a three-year hiatus following the disbanding of the PWBA in 2003, was telecast for five weeks on ESPN in September‚ÄìOctober, 2007. ESPN again held multi-week broadcasts of the event in 2008, while ESPN2 did the same in 2009. In 2010, USBC reverted to a more traditional format and a one-day stepladder-style TV finals, airing live on ESPN2. That event was held in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, with Kelly Kulick winning. Kulick became the first bowler ever to win the USBC Queens and US Women's Open in the same year.USOC's official bowling webpage USBC announced in May, 2010 that it would not conduct the US Women's Open in 2011, as the BPAA had agreed to resume its association with the tournament. The TV finals took place June 30, 2011 at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where Leanne Hulsenberg was crowned champion. In May 2008, USBC conducted a special made-for-TV event called \\"Bowling's Clash of the Champions\\". The taped telecast was broadcast May 10 and 11 on CBS, marking the first time bowling had been broadcast on regular network television since June 26, 1999.\\"Special event brings bowling back to network television\\" January 22, 2008. The event featured eight male and eight female bowlers representing youth, college, senior, amateur and professional bowlers who had won recent USBC titles. It was won by Lynda Barnes. The event returned to CBS in 2009, when it was won by Chris Barnes, Lynda's husband.Bowling Digital In 2009, USBC began showing championship competition live free on its website, BOWL.com.BOWL.com In 2011, USBC moved this coverage to its YouTube channel, YouTube.com/BowlTV.

SMART program The SMART program (Scholarship Management and Accounting Report for Tenpins) was established in 1994 in order to manage and store bowling scholarships until the youth bowler requests the use of the scholarships for college. The bowling scholarships can be from winning tournaments to filling out scholarship application forms. Recently the validity of the term \\"scholarship\\" for the SMART program has been questioned by the MHSAA (Michigan High School Athletic Association). The association questions where the education requirements are in earning the \\"scholarships.\\" Most bowling scholarships earned are from winning a tournament, and are awarded as a cash prize in the form of a scholarship with no GPA or formal scholarly work necessary to claim the money once in college. This in turn has caused the MHSAA to rule high school athletes \\"ineligible\\" due to \\"accepting cash, checks, or any other form of award over $25 in value.\\" This rule is highly debated and has questionable means of enforcement. To receive such scholarships, the athlete must simply sign into their SMART account and fill out the necessary information whereupon the money is sent directly to the schools, not given to the athlete themselves. There are special circumstances which allow money be sent directly to the athlete.

He preferred to work collaboratively with liberal white groups in the South, quietly as a \\"sideline activist,\\" to get practical results. His position is often contrasted with that of W. E. B. Du Bois, who was a powerful and militant advocate for blacks and described Johnson as \\"too conservative.\\" During Johnson's academic studies and leadership of Fisk University during the 1930s and 1940s, the South had legal racial segregation and Jim Crow discriminatory laws and practices, including having disfranchised most black voters in constitutions passed at the turn of the century. Johnson was unwavering in personal terms in his opposition to this oppressive system, yet he worked hard to change race relations in terms of short-term practical gains. His grandson Jeh Johnson served as the United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2013 to 2017. Early life and education Johnson was born in 1893 in Bristol, Virginia, to well-educated parents. His father was a respected Baptist minister, and his mother was educated in public school. He attended a boarding school in Richmond, Virginia, then earned a B.A. in sociology from Virginia Union University. Afterward, he began graduate study of sociology at the University of Chicago, though his study was interrupted by service in France during World War I as a non-commissioned officer with the US army. After returning to the US, he resumed graduate work at the University of Chicago, where he earned his Ph.D. in sociology. In 1920 Johnson married Marie Antoinette Burgette. When he was appointed director of research and investigation of the National Urban League, the couple moved to New York City. Career After the race riot of 1919, when blacks fought back against white attacks as part of the urban violence in numerous cities during Red Summer, Johnson worked as a researcher for the National Urban League and in 1921, he became the League‚Äôs research director. During his time with the National Urban League, he also founded the magazine Opportunity as an outlet for black expression in the arts. He was a principal researcher and author for the Chicago Commission on Race Relations for its report on the riot. Newspapers of the period had reported that the instigators were largely ethnic Irish trying to maintain economic and social dominance over blacks in South Chicago; Johnson noted that African Americans had rebelled against the denial of economic and social opportunity. His work was fundamental to The Negro in Chicago: A Study of Race Relations and a Race Riot (1922), published by the University of Chicago Press.The Negro in Chicago: A Study of Race Relations and a Race Riot, University of Chicago Press, 1922. It was considered a classic model for comprehensive commission reports. In the 1920s Johnson moved to New York City, where he became research director for the National Urban League. He was an \\"entrepreneur of the Harlem Renaissance,\\" the creative movement by African-American writers and artists of that time. He edited two journals that published many writers of the period, and established prizes at the National Urban League to recognize young writers. In Harlem, he argued for black artists saying that they must use their own experiences as the basis for their creativity, rejecting European standards. His goal was to improve Negro self-image and character, and he felt that by writing they could achieve this. =Return to the South= Johnson yearned to return to the South, not only to study race relations but to change them. In 1926 he moved to Nashville, taking a position as chair of the Department of Sociology at Fisk University, a historically black college. There he wrote or directed numerous studies of how combined legal, economic and social factors produced an oppressive racial structure. Two of his works have become classics: Shadow of the Plantation (1934), and Growing up in the Black Belt (1940). In 1929 an American missionary in Liberia reported that Liberian officials were using soldiers to gather tribal people who were shipped to the island of Fernando Po as forced laborers. The Liberian government denied the charges and invited a League of Nations commission of inquiry. Cuthbert Christy of Britain headed the commission. Johnson was the United States representative. The former President of Liberia Arthur Barclay represented his country. The commission began work on April 8, 1930. The result of the inquiries was an outspoken report submitted in September 1930. It found that the laborers had been recruited \\"under condition of criminal compulsion scarcely distinguishable from slave raiding and slave trading.\\" As a result of the Christy report, President Charles D. B. King and Vice-president Allen N. Yancy both resigned. In 1930 Johnson was awarded the Harmon Prize for Science, for his work The Negro in American Civilization. In 1946 Johnson was appointed as the first black president of Fisk University. He attracted outstanding faculty, including the author Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Aaron Douglas and others. In 1946, Johnson was one of 20 American educators selected to advise on educational reform in occupied Japan. He was also a consultant for several White House conferences related to youth in American society, and a member of the first Board of Foreign Scholarships for the Fulbright Program. Johnson lived to celebrate the landmark Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which ruled that racial segregation in the public schools was unconstitutional. He played a key role in the effort to implement the decision in the face of \\"massive resistance\\" in the South. His work and that of his peers also contributed to passage of federal civil rights legislation of the mid-1960s. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was also a charter member of the Zeta Rho chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity, chartered at Fisk in 1953. Johnson died unexpectedly in 1956. He was traveling by train from Nashville to New York when he had a heart attack on the platform at a stop in Louisville, Kentucky. He was 63 years old.

In terms of context and convention, it is a subgenre of the broader ranging thriller narrative structure,Dictionary.com, definition, psychological thriller (definition), Accessed November 3, 2013, \\"...a suspenseful movie or book emphasizing the psychology of its characters rather than the plot; this subgenre of thriller movie or book ‚Äì Example: In a psychological thriller, the characters are exposed to danger on a mental level rather than a physical one....\\", with similarities to Gothic and detective fiction in the sense of sometimes having a \\"dissolving sense of reality\\". It is often told through the viewpoint of psychologically stressed characters, revealing their distorted mental perceptions and focusing on the complex and often tortured relationships between obsessive and pathological characters.Christopher Pittard, Blackwell Reference, Psychological Thrillers, Accessed November 3, 2013, \\"...characteristics of the genre as ‚Äúa dissolving sense of reality; reticence in moral pronouncements; obsessive, pathological characters; the narrative privileging of complex, tortured relationships‚Äù ( Munt 1994)...\\" Psychological thrillers often incorporate elements of mystery, drama, action, and paranoia. Closely related to the psychological horror genre, the latter generally involves more horror and terror elements and themes. Definition Peter Hutchings states varied films have been labeled psychological thrillers, but it usually refers to \\"narratives with domesticated settings in which action is suppressed and where thrills are provided instead via investigations of the psychologies of the principal characters.\\" A distinguishing characteristic of a psychological thriller is it emphasizes the mental states of its characters: their perceptions, thoughts, distortions, and general struggle to grasp reality. According to director John Madden, psychological thrillers focus on story, character development, choice, and moral conflict; fear and anxiety drive the psychological tension in unpredictable ways. Madden stated their lack of spectacle and strong emphasis on character led to their decline in Hollywood popularity. Psychological thrillers are suspenseful by exploiting uncertainty over characters' motives, honesty, and how they see the world. Films can also cause discomfort in audiences by privileging them with information they wish to share with the characters; guilty characters may suffer similar distress by virtue of their knowledge. However, James N. Frey defines psychological thrillers as a style, rather than a subgenre; Frey states good thrillers focus on the psychology of their antagonists and build suspense slowly through ambiguity. Creators and/or film distributors or publishers who seek to distance themselves from the negative connotations of horror often categorize their work as a psychological thriller. The same situation can occur when critics label a work to be a psychological thriller in order to elevate its perceived literary value. Literary devices and techniques * Plot twist ‚Äì Films such as Psycho and The Skeleton Key have advertised the fact that they contain plot twists and asked audiences to refrain from revealing spoilers. Psychological thrillers with poorly received plot twists, such as The Village, have suffered in the box office. * Unreliable narrator ‚Äì Andrew Taylor identifies the unreliable narrator as a common literary device used in psychological thrillers and traces it back to Edgar Allan Poe's influence on the genre. Criminal insanity may be explored as a theme. * MacGuffin ‚Äì Alfred Hitchcock pioneered the concept of the MacGuffin, a goal or item that initiates or otherwise advances the plot. The MacGuffin is frequently only vaguely defined, and it can be used to increase suspense. * Red Herring - Red herring was popularized by William Cobbett and is defined as a kind of fallacy that is an irrelevant topic introduced to divert the attention of the audience. A red herring is used to lead the audience to make false assumptions and mislead their attention. Themes Many psychological thrillers have emerged over the past years, all in various media (film, literature, radio, etc.). Despite these very different forms of representation, general trends have appeared throughout the narratives. Some of these consistent themes include: * Death * Existence/Purpose * Identity * Mind * Perception * Reality In psychological thrillers, characters often have to battle an inner struggle. Amnesia is a common plot device used to explore these questions. Character may be threatened with death, be forced to deal with the deaths of others, or fake their own deaths. Psychological thrillers can be complex, and reviewers may recommend a second or third viewing to \\"decipher its secrets.\\" Common elements may include stock characters, such as a hardboiled detective and serial killer, involved in a cat and mouse game. Sensation novels, examples of early psychological thrillers, were considered to be socially irresponsible due to their themes of sex and violence. These novels, among others, were inspired by the exploits of real-life detective Jack Whicher. Water, especially floods, is frequently used to represent the unconscious mind, such as in What Lies Beneath and In Dreams. Psychological thrillers may not always be concerned with plausibility. Peter Hutchings defines the giallo, an Italian subgenre of psychological thrillers, as violent murder mysteries that focus on style and spectacle over rationality. According to Peter B. Flint of The New York Times, detractors of Alfred Hitchcock accused him of \\"relying on slick tricks, illogical story lines and wild coincidences\\".

He went to France to study physics at the University of Paris. In 1904 he was awarded a PhD in physics for his thesis Recherches sur l'effet magn√©tique des corps electris√©s en mouvement (Research on the magnetic effect of electrified bodies in motion). After a year as a professor at the University of Lille, he returned to Romania to teach at the School of Bridges, Roads and Mines, where he was appointed director in February 1920. As a result of his efforts, the School was transformed later that year into the Polytechnic University of Bucharest. Vasilescu Karpen was the first rector of this university, serving in that capacity until 1940. In 1908(?) he is said to have invented the Karpen Pile. He was the engineer who introduced a permanent wire telecom bridge between Brasov City and Bucharest. He introduced electrically transmitted \\"wired telegrams\\" in the Old Romanian Kingdom by 1920. He became a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1923; Membrii Academiei Rom√¢ne din 1866 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent at the Romanian Academy site stripped of membership by the new communist regime in 1948, he was restored to the Academy in 1955.Dan Berindei, \\"Academia Rom√¢nƒÉ »ôi revolu»õia din decembrie 1989\\", in Memoriile Sec»õiei de »òtiin»õe Istorice, Volume 33/2008, p. 157 Karpen Pile The Karpen Pile is claimed to be a battery that has provided continuous energy for over 60 years, making it either a supremely effective method of storing energy or a hoax, furthermore some newspapers describe it as a perpetuum mobile, but most scientists disagree since such a device would violate the Second law of thermodynamics. The device is housed at the Dimitrie Leonida National Technical Museum by 2010. There were claims that it had been working there continuously for 60 years. However, that was a misunderstanding, as the device has been in working condition for 60 years, but it is not powering a load. It uses platinum and gold electrodes and since is not loaded, no detectable corrosion effect happens. Normally, one electrode should corrode and lose ions which should deposit around the other electrode. Apparently, this doesn‚Äôt happen. The cell is just as basic as it gets: two pure electrodes immersed in pure sulfuric acid. Everything sealed. However, the fact that the electrodes are made of gold and platinum (the least reactive metals) and the very low density of the generated power could be the reason why the pile is still working.

The settlement was destroyed within a year by England. Almost nothing is known of Plockhoy's childhood and early life, but it is reasonable to assume he came from Zeeland and had a Mennonite background. In the early 1660s he lived at Amsterdam, where he became associated with the struggle of the liberal Mennonites, who were influenced by Collegiantism and were led by Galenus Abrahamsz de Haan, against the conservative Mennonites. Before embarking for the New World, Plockhoy unsuccessfully petitioned Oliver Cromwell in 1658 for support in establishing various ideal settlements in England. It's possible that he worked in the circle of the intellectual Samuel Hartlib, who was certainly aware of his utopian plans. Plockhoy published political pamphlets addressing contemporary social problems in 1658 and collaborated with Franciscus van den Enden in plans for founding a new society in New Netherland. Some contemporary writers that were critical of his views alleged that Plockhoy defended polygamy. Plockhoy moved back to the Netherlands in 1661. He entered into a contract with the Dutch government to create a settlement along the southern part of the Delaware River. In 1663 Plockhoy and 41 settlers made their way to Delaware Bay and established their colony near the former Zwaanendael Colony. It is not known whether he survived the 1664 English raid on his settlement, but he is generally thought to have died within a few years of that event. Plockhoy's wife, his blind son, Cornelis, and several of the other original colonists continued to live in Lewes. In 1694 a blind man named Cornelis Plockhoy moved to Germantown, Pennsylvania. Although older sources usually identified this man as the aged Pieter Cornelisz Plockhoy, current writers generally agree that this was his son, Cornelis.

The latter included 562 princely states, having different types of revenue sharing arrangements with the British, often depending on their size, population and local conditions. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and Portugal. The political integration of these territories into India was a declared objective of the Indian National Congress, and the Government of India pursued this over the next decade. Through a combination of factors, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of the various princely states to accede to India. Having secured their accession, they then proceeded, in a step-by- step process, to secure and extend the central government's authority over these states and transform their administrations until, by 1956, there was little difference between the territories that had been part of British India and those that had been princely states. Simultaneously, the Government of India, through a combination of military and diplomatic means, acquired de facto and de jure control over the remaining colonial enclaves, which too were integrated into India. Although this process successfully integrated the vast majority of princely states into India, it was not as successful for a few, notably the former princely states of Jammu and Kashmir, Tripura and Manipur, where active secessionist separatist insurgencies continued to exist due to various reasons. While insurgency in Tripura has been neutralized today, it still continues to exist in Jammu and Kashmir and Manipur. Princely states in India The early history of British expansion in India was characterised by the co-existence of two approaches towards the existing princely states. The first was a policy of annexation, where the British sought to forcibly absorb the Indian princely states into the provinces which constituted their Empire in India. The second was a policy of indirect rule, where the British assumed suzerainty and paramountcy over princely states, but conceded to them sovereignty and varying degrees of internal self-government.; During the early part of the 19th century, the policy of the British tended towards annexation, but the Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced a change in this approach, by demonstrating both the difficulty of absorbing and subduing annexed states, and the usefulness of princely states as a source of support. In 1858, the policy of annexation was formally renounced, and British relations with the remaining princely states thereafter were based on subsidiary alliances, whereby the British exercised paramountcy over all princely states, with the British crown as ultimate suzerain, but at the same time respected and protected them as allies, taking control of their external relations. The exact relations between the British and each princely state were regulated by individual treaties and varied widely, with some states having complete internal self-government, others being subject to significant control in their internal affairs, and some rulers being in effect little more than the owners of landed estates, with little autonomy. During the 20th century, the British made several attempts to integrate the princely states more closely with British India, in 1921 creating the Chamber of Princes as a consultative and advisory body, and in 1936 transferring the responsibility for the supervision of smaller states from the provinces to the centre and creating direct relations between the Government of India and the larger princely states, superseding political agents. A more ambitious aim was a scheme of federation contained in the Government of India Act 1935, which envisaged the princely states and British India being united under a federal government. This scheme came close to success, but was abandoned in 1939 as a result of the outbreak of the Second World War. As a result, in the 1940s the relationship between the princely states and the crown remained regulated by the principle of paramountcy and by the various treaties between the British crown and the states. Neither paramountcy nor the subsidiary alliances could continue after Indian independence. The British took the view that because they had been established directly between the British crown and the princely states, they could not be transferred to the newly independent dominions of India and Pakistan. At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it was not prepared to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states. The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties between them and the princely states, would come to an end upon the British departure from India. Reasons for integration Saurashtra and Kathiawar regions of Gujarat were home to over two hundred princely states, many with non-contiguous territories, as this map of Baroda shows. The termination of paramountcy meant that all rights flowing from the states' relationship with the British crown would return to them, leaving them free to negotiate relationships with the new states of India and Pakistan \\"on a basis of complete freedom\\". Early British plans for the transfer of power, such as the offer produced by the Cripps Mission, recognised the possibility that some princely states might choose to stand out of independent India. This was unacceptable to the Indian National Congress, which regarded the independence of princely states as a denial of the course of Indian history, and consequently regarded this scheme as a \\"Balkanisation\\" of India.. The Congress had traditionally been less active in the princely states because of their limited resources which restricted their ability to organise there and their focus on the goal of independence from the British, and because Congress leaders, in particular Mohandas Gandhi, were sympathetic to the more progressive princes as examples of the capacity of Indians to rule themselves. This changed in the 1930s as a result of the federation scheme contained in the Government of India Act 1935 and the rise of socialist Congress leaders such as Jayaprakash Narayan, and the Congress began to actively engage with popular political and labour activity in the princely states. By 1939, the Congress's formal stance was that the states must enter independent India, on the same terms and with the same autonomy as the provinces of British India, and with their people granted responsible government. As a result, it attempted to insist on the incorporation of the princely states into India in its negotiations with the British, but the British took the view that this was not in their power to grant. A few British leaders, particularly Lord Mountbatten, the last British viceroy of India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely states to the British India through a complex network of interests. Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, and other similar agreements would get terminated, posing a serious threat to the economic life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian officials such as V. P. Menon that the integration of the princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage the wounds of partition. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress. Accepting integration =The princes' position= The rulers of the princely states were not uniformly enthusiastic about integrating their domains into independent India. The Jamkhandi State integrated first with Independent India. Some, such as the rulers of Bikaner and Jawhar, were motivated to join India out of ideological and patriotic considerations, but others insisted that they had the right to join either India or Pakistan, to remain independent, or form a union of their own. Bhopal, Travancore and Hyderabad announced that they did not intend to join either dominion.; Hyderabad went as far as to appoint trade representatives in European countries and commencing negotiations with the Portuguese to lease or buy Goa to give it access to the sea, and Travancore pointed to the strategic importance to western countries of its thorium reserves while asking for recognition.; Some states proposed a subcontinent-wide confederation of princely states, as a third entity in addition to India and Pakistan. Bhopal attempted to build an alliance between the princely states and the Muslim League to counter the pressure being put on rulers by the Congress. A number of factors contributed to the collapse of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League to stay out of the Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly. Many princes were also pressured by popular sentiment favouring integration with India, which meant their plans for independence had little support from their subjects. The Maharaja of Travancore, for example, definitively abandoned his plans for independence after the attempted assassination of his dewan, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. In a few states, the chief ministers or dewans played a significant role in convincing the princes to accede to India. The key factors that led the states to accept integration into India were, however, the efforts of Lord Mountbatten, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon. The latter two were respectively the political and administrative heads of the States Department, which was in charge of relations with the princely states. =Mountbatten's role= Lord Louis Mountbatten played an important role in convincing reluctant monarchs to accede to the Indian Union. Mountbatten believed that securing the states' accession to India was crucial to reaching a negotiated settlement with the Congress for the transfer of power. As a relative of the British King, he was trusted by most of the princes and was a personal friend of many, especially the Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan. The princes also believed that he would be in a position to ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel had asked him to become the first Governor General of the Dominion of India. Mountbatten used his influence with the princes to push them towards accession. He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status to any of the princely states, nor would it accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant that the British Crown would sever all connections with the states unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He pointed out that the Indian subcontinent was one economic entity, and that the states would suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of communal violence and communist movements. Mountbatten stressed that he would act as the trustee of the princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which he was free to do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal. At the time, several princes complained that they were being betrayed by Britain, who they regarded as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten played a crucial role in ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.; =Pressure and diplomacy= Vallabhbhai Patel as Minister for Home and States Affairs had the responsibility of welding the British Indian, provinces and the princely states into a united India. By far the most significant factor that led to the princes' decision to accede to India was the policy of the Congress and, in particular, of Patel and Menon. The Congress' stated position was that the princely states were not sovereign entities, and as such could not opt to be independent notwithstanding the end of paramountcy. The princely states must therefore accede to either India or Pakistan. In July 1946, Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India. In January 1947, he said that independent India would not accept the divine right of kings, and in May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. Other Congress leaders, such as C. Rajagopalachari, argued that as paramountcy \\"came into being as a fact and not by agreement\\", it would necessarily pass to the government of independent India, as the successor of the British. Patel and Menon, who were charged with the actual job of negotiating with the princes, took a more conciliatory approach than Nehru. The official policy statement of the Government of India made by Patel on 5 July 1947 made no threats. Instead, it emphasised the unity of India and the common interests of the princes and independent India, reassured them about the Congress' intentions, and invited them to join independent India \\"to make laws sitting together as friends than to make treaties as aliens\\". He reiterated that the States Department would not attempt to establish a relationship of domination over the princely states. Unlike the Political Department of the British Government, it would not be an instrument of paramountcy, but a medium whereby business could be conducted between the states and India as equals. =Instruments of accession= Patel and Menon backed up their diplomatic efforts by producing treaties that were designed to be attractive to rulers of princely states. Two key documents were produced. The first was the Standstill Agreement, which confirmed the continuance of the pre-existing agreements and administrative practices. The second was the Instrument of Accession, by which the ruler of the princely state in question agreed to the accession of his kingdom to independent India, granting the latter control over specified subject matters. The nature of the subject matters varied depending on the acceding state. The states which had internal autonomy under the British signed an Instrument of Accession which only ceded three subjects to the government of India‚Äîdefence, external affairs, and communications, each defined in accordance with List 1 to Schedule VII of the Government of India Act 1935. Rulers of states which were in effect estates or talukas, where substantial administrative powers were exercised by the Crown, signed a different Instrument of Accession, which vested all residuary powers and jurisdiction in the Government of India. Rulers of states which had an intermediate status signed a third type of Instrument, which preserved the degree of power they had under the British. The Instruments of Accession implemented a number of other safeguards. Clause 7 provided that the princes would not be bound to the Indian constitution as and when it was drafted. Clause 8 guaranteed their autonomy in all areas that were not ceded to the Government of India. This was supplemented by a number of promises. Rulers who agreed to accede would receive guarantees that their extra-territorial rights, such as immunity from prosecution in Indian courts and exemption from customs duty, would be protected, that they would be allowed to democratise slowly, that none of the eighteen major states would be forced to merge, and that they would remain eligible for British honours and decorations. In discussions, Lord Mountbatten reinforced the statements of Patel and Menon by emphasising that the documents gave the princes all the \\"practical independence\\" they needed. Mountbatten, Patel and Menon also sought to give princes the impression that if they did not accept the terms put to them then, they might subsequently need to accede on substantially less favourable terms.; The Standstill Agreement was also used as a negotiating tool, as the States Department categorically ruled out signing a Standstill Agreement with princely states that did not sign an Instrument of Accession. Accession process The limited scope of the Instruments of Accession and the promise of a wide-ranging autonomy and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient comfort to many rulers, who saw this as the best deal they could strike given the lack of support from the British, and popular internal pressures. Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on 15 August 1947, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession. A few, however, held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession. Piploda, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948. The biggest problems, however, arose with a few border states, such as Jodhpur, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with Junagadh, which actually did accede to Pakistan, and with Hyderabad and Kashmir, which declared that they intended to remain independent. =Border states= The ruler of Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was antipathetic to the Congress, and did not see much future in India for him or the lifestyle he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer, he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the designated head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was keen to attract some of the larger border states, hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that it would be difficult for him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the two-nation theory on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India. =Junagadh= Although the states were in theory free to choose whether they wished to accede to India or Pakistan, Mountbatten had pointed out that \\"geographic compulsions\\" meant that most of them must choose India. In effect, he took the position that only the states that shared a border with Pakistan could choose to accede to it. The Nawab of Junagadh, a princely state located on the south-western end of Gujarat and having no common border with Pakistan, chose to accede to Pakistan ignoring Mountbatten's views, arguing that it could be reached from Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh‚ÄîMangrol and Babariawad‚Äîreacted to this by declaring their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India. In response, the Nawab of Junagadh militarily occupied the states. The rulers of neighbouring states reacted angrily, sending their troops to the Junagadh frontier and appealed to the Government of India for assistance. A group of Junagadhi people, led by Samaldas Gandhi, formed a government-in-exile, the Aarzi Hukumat (\\"temporary government\\"). India believed that if Junagadh was permitted to go to Pakistan, the communal tension already simmering in Gujarat would worsen, and refused to accept the accession. The government pointed out that the state was 80% Hindu, and called for a referendum to decide the question of accession. Simultaneously, they cut off supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and reoccupied the principalities of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India. Pakistan agreed to discuss a plebiscite, subject to the withdrawal of Indian troops, a condition India rejected. On 26 October, the Nawab and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops. On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State's administration. The Government of India agreed. A plebiscite was conducted in February 1948, which went almost unanimously in favour of accession to India. =Jammu and Kashmir= Jammu and Kashmir while the Aksai Chin is under Chinese administration. At the time of the transfer of power, the state of Jammu and Kashmir (widely called \\"Kashmir\\") was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority. Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication. Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation. Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions. The plebiscite was never held, and on 26 January 1950, the Constitution of India came into force in Kashmir, but with special provisions made for the state. India did not, however, secure administrative control over all of Kashmir. The northern and western portions of Kashmir came under Pakistan's control in 1947, and are today Pakistan-administered Kashmir. In the 1962 Sino-Indian War, China occupied Aksai Chin, the north-eastern region bordering Ladakh, which it continues to control and administer. The state was reorganised by Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019. =Hyderabad= Hyderabad state in 1909. Its former territories are today incorporated in the Indian states of Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Major General Syed Ahmed El Edroos (at right) offers his surrender of the Hyderabad State Forces to Major General (later General and Army Chief) Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri at Secunderabad. Hyderabad was a landlocked state that stretched over 82,000 square miles (over 212,000 square kilometres) in southeastern India. While 87% of its 17 million people were Hindu, its ruler Nizam Osman Ali Khan was a Muslim, and its politics were dominated by a Muslim elite. The Muslim nobility and the Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, a powerful pro-Nizam Muslim party, insisted Hyderabad remain independent and stand on an equal footing to India and Pakistan. Accordingly, the Nizam in June 1947 issued a firman announcing that on the transfer of power, his state would be resuming independence. The Government of India rejected the firman, terming it a \\"legalistic claim of doubtful validity\\". It argued that the strategic location of Hyderabad, which lay astride the main lines of communication between northern and southern India, meant it could easily be used by \\"foreign interests\\" to threaten India, and that in consequence, the issue involved national-security concerns. It also pointed out that the state's people, history and location made it unquestionably Indian, and that its own \\"common interests\\" therefore mandated its integration into India. The Nizam was prepared to enter into a limited treaty with India, which gave Hyderabad safeguards not provided for in the standard Instrument of Accession, such as a provision guaranteeing Hyderabad's neutrality in the event of a conflict between India and Pakistan. India rejected this proposal, arguing that other states would demand similar concessions. A temporary Standstill Agreement was signed as a stopgap measure, even though Hyderabad had not yet agreed to accede to India. By December 1947, however, India was accusing Hyderabad of repeatedly violating the Agreement, while the Nizam alleged that India was blockading his state, a charge India denied. The Nizam was also beset by the Telangana Rebellion, led by communists, which started in 1946 as a peasant revolt against feudal elements; and one which the Nizam was not able to subjugate. The situation deteriorated further in 1948. The Razakars (\\"volunteers\\"), a militia affiliated to the Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen and set up under the influence of Muslim radical Qasim Razvi, assumed the role of supporting the Muslim ruling class against upsurges by the Hindu populace, and began intensifying its activities and was accused of attempting to intimidate villages. The Hyderabad State Congress Party, affiliated to the Indian National Congress, launched a political agitation. Matters were made worse by communist groups, which had originally supported the Congress but now switched sides and began attacking Congress groups. Attempts by Mountbatten to find a negotiated solution failed and, in August, the Nizam, claiming that he feared an imminent invasion, attempted to approach the UN Security Council and the International Court of Justice. Patel now insisted that if Hyderabad was allowed to continue its independence, the prestige of the Government would be tarnished and then neither Hindus nor Muslims would feel secure in its realm. On 13 September 1948, the Indian Army was sent into Hyderabad under Operation Polo on the grounds that the law and order situation there threatened the peace of South India. The troops met little resistance by the Razakars and between 13 and 18 September took complete control of the state. The operation led to massive communal violence with estimates of deaths ranging from the official one of 27,000‚Äì40,000 to scholarly ones of 200,000 or more. The Nizam was retained as the head of state in the same manner as the other princes who acceded to India. He thereupon disavowed the complaints that had been made to the UN and, despite vehement protests from Pakistan and strong criticism from other countries, the Security Council did not deal further with the question, and Hyderabad was absorbed into India.; Completing integration Central Provinces and Berar, which form part of modern Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra The British-ruled Madras Province and adjacent princely states The Madras Presidency was divided and merged with neighbouring princely states to produce Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The Instruments of Accession were limited, transferring control of only three matters to India, and would by themselves have produced a rather loose federation, with significant differences in administration and governance across the various states. Full political integration, in contrast, would require a process whereby the political actors in the various states were \\"persuaded to shift their loyalties, expectations, and political activities towards a new center\\", namely, the Republic of India. This was not an easy task. While some princely states such as Mysore had legislative systems of governance that were based on a broad franchise and not significantly different from those of British India, in others, political decision-making took place in small, limited aristocratic circles and governance was, as a result, at best paternalistic and at worst the result of courtly intrigue. Having secured the accession of the princely states, the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 turned to the task of welding the states and the former British provinces into one polity under a single republican constitution. =Fast-track integration= The first step in this process, carried out between 1947 and 1949, was to merge the smaller states that were not seen by the Government of India to be viable administrative units either into neighbouring provinces, or with other princely states to create a \\"princely union\\". This policy was contentious, since it involved the dissolution of the very states whose existence India had only recently guaranteed in the Instruments of Accession. Patel and Menon emphasised that without integration, the economies of states would collapse, and anarchy would arise if the princes were unable to provide democracy and govern properly. They pointed out that many of the smaller states were very small and lacked resources to sustain their economies and support their growing populations. Many also imposed tax rules and other restrictions that impeded free trade, and which had to be dismantled in a united India. Given that merger involved the breach of guarantees personally given by Mountbatten, initially Patel and Nehru intended to wait until after his term as Governor- General ended. An adivasi uprising in Orissa in late 1947, however, forced their hand. In December 1947, princes from the Eastern India Agency and Chhattisgarh Agency were summoned to an all-night meeting with Menon, where they were persuaded to sign Merger Agreements integrating their states into Orissa, the Central Provinces and Bihar with effect from 1 January 1948. Later that year, 66 states in Gujarat and the Deccan were merged into Bombay, including the large states of Kolhapur and Baroda. Other small states were merged into Madras, East Punjab, West Bengal, the United Provinces and Assam. Not all states that signed Merger Agreements were integrated into provinces, however. Thirty states of the former Punjab Hill States Agency which lay near the international border and had signed Merger Agreements were integrated into Himachal Pradesh, a distinct entity which was administered directly by the centre as a Chief Commissioner's Province, for reasons of security. The Merger Agreements required rulers to cede \\"full and exclusive jurisdiction and powers for and in relation to governance\\" of their state to the Dominion of India. In return for their agreement to entirely cede their states, it gave princes a large number of guarantees. Princes would receive an annual payment from the Indian government in the form of a privy purse as compensation for the surrender of their powers and the dissolution of their states. While state property would be taken over, their private property would be protected, as would all personal privileges, dignities and titles. Succession was also guaranteed according to custom. In addition, the provincial administration was obliged to take on the staff of the princely states with guarantees of equal pay and treatment. Although the Merger Agreements were principally intended for smaller, non-viable states, they were also applied to a few larger states. Kutch in western India, and Tripura and Manipur in Northeast India, all of which lay along international borders, were also asked to sign Merger Agreements, despite being larger states, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. Bhopal, whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the Maratha states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which was likely to be flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam. =Four-step integration= Merger The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince adjacent large states and a large number of adjacent small states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies‚Äîthe council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements. Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore- Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad. Democratisation Merging the administrative machineries of each state and integrating them into one political and administrative entity was not easy, particularly as many of the merged states had a history of rivalry. In the former Central India Agency, whose princely states had initially been merged into a princely union called Vindhya Pradesh, the rivalry between two groups of states became so bad that the Government of India persuaded the rulers to sign a Merger Agreement abrogating the old Covenants of Merger, and took direct control of the state as a Chief Commissioner's State. As such, the mergers did not meet the expectations of the Government of India or the States Department. In December 1947, Menon suggested requiring the rulers of states to take \\"practical steps towards the establishment of popular government\\". The States Department accepted his suggestion, and implemented it through a special covenant signed by the rajpramukhs of the merged princely unions, binding them to act as constitutional monarchs. This meant that their powers were de facto no different from those of the Governors of the former British provinces, thus giving the people of their territories the same measure of responsible government as the people of the rest of India. The result of this process has been described as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form. While this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had always been that independent India would inherit the position of being the paramount power. States of India in 1951 Centralisation and constitutionalisation Democratisation still left open one important distinction between the former princely states and the former British provinces, namely, that since the princely states had signed limited Instruments of Accession covering only three subjects, they were insulated from government policies in other areas. The Congress viewed this as hampering its ability to frame policies that brought about social justice and national development. Consequently, they sought to secure to the central government the same degree of powers over the former princely states as it had over the former British provinces. In May 1948, at the initiative of V. P. Menon, a meeting was held in Delhi between the Rajpramukhs of the princely unions and the States Department, at the end of which the Rajpramukhs signed new Instruments of Accession which gave the Government of India the power to pass laws in respect of all matters that fell within the seventh schedule of the Government of India Act 1935. Subsequently, each of the princely unions, as well as Mysore and Hyderabad, agreed to adopt the Constitution of India as the constitution of that state, thus ensuring that they were placed in exactly the same legal position vis-√†-vis the central government as the former British provinces. The only exception was Kashmir, whose relationship with India continued to be governed by the original Instrument of Accession, and the constitution produced by the state's Constituent Assembly. Effective from 1950, the Constitution of India classified the constituent units of India into three classes‚ÄîPart A, B, and C states. The former British provinces, together with the princely states that had been merged into them, were the Part A states. The princely unions, plus Mysore and Hyderabad, were the Part B states. The former Chief Commissioners' Provinces and other centrally administered areas, except the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, were the Part C states. The only practical difference between the Part A states and the Part B states was that the constitutional heads of the Part B states were the Rajpramukhs appointed under the terms of the Covenants of Merger, rather than Governors appointed by the central government. In addition, Constitution gave the central government a significant range of powers over the former princely states, providing amongst other things that \\"their governance shall be under the general control of, and comply with such particular directions, if any, as may from time to time be given by, the President\\". Apart from that, the form of government in both was identical. Reorganisation The distinction between Part A and Part B states was only intended to last for a brief, transitional period. In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act reorganised the former British provinces and princely states on the basis of language. Simultaneously, the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution removed the distinction between Part A and Part B states, both of which were now treated only as \\"states\\", with Part C states being renamed \\"union territories\\". The Rajpramukhs lost their authority, and were replaced as the constitutional heads of state by Governors, who were appointed by the central government. These changes finally brought the princely order to an end. In both legal and practical terms, the territories that had been part of the princely states were now fully integrated into India and did not differ in any way from those that had been part of British India. The personal privileges of the princes‚Äîthe privy purse, the exemption from customs duty, and customary dignities‚Äîsurvived, only to be abolished in 1971. Post-integration issues =The princes= Although the progressive integration of the princely states into India was largely peaceful, not all princes were happy with the outcome. Many had expected the Instruments of Accession to be permanent, and were unhappy about losing the autonomy and the guaranteed continued existence of their states they had expected to gain. Some felt uneasy about the disappearance of states that generations of their family had controlled, while others were unhappy about the disappearance of administrative structures they had worked hard to build up and which they believed to be efficient. The majority, however, despite the \\"strain and tension\\" of adapting to life as private citizens, were content to retire on the generous pension provided by the privy purse. Several took advantage of their eligibility to hold public offices under the central government. The Maharaja of Bhavnagar, Col. Krishna Kumarasingh Bhavasingh Gohil, for example, became the Governor of Madras State, and several others were appointed to diplomatic posts overseas. =Colonial enclaves= The French enclaves in 1947 The integration of the princely states raised the question of the future of the remaining colonial enclaves in India. At independence, the regions of Pondicherry, Karaikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France, and Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India. It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by Edouard Goubert, used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in Pondicherry and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the French National Assembly in May 1962, de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred. Demonstrators demanding the integration of Goa into India march against the Portuguese on 15 August 1955. Portugal, in contrast, resisted diplomatic solutions. It viewed its continued possession of its Indian enclaves as a matter of national pride and, in 1951, it amended its constitution to convert its possessions in India into Portuguese provinces. In July 1954, an uprising in Dadra and Nagar Haveli threw off Portuguese rule. The Portuguese attempted to send forces from Daman to reoccupy the enclaves, but were prevented from doing so by Indian troops. Portugal initiated proceedings before the International Court of Justice to compel India to allow its troops access to the enclave, but the Court rejected its complaint in 1960, holding that India was within its rights in denying Portugal military access. In 1961, the Constitution of India was amended to incorporate Dadra and Nagar Haveli into India as a Union Territory. Goa, Daman and Diu remained an outstanding issue. On 15 August 1955, five thousand non-violent demonstrators marched against the Portuguese at the border, and were met with gunfire, killing 22. In December 1960, the United Nations General Assembly rejected Portugal's contention that its overseas possessions were provinces, and formally listed them as \\"non-self-governing territories\\". Although Nehru continued to favour a negotiated solution, the Portuguese suppression of a revolt in Angola in 1961 radicalised Indian public opinion, and increased the pressure on the Government of India to take military action. African leaders, too, put pressure on Nehru to take action in Goa, which they argued would save Africa from further horrors. On 18 December 1961, following the collapse of an American attempt to find a negotiated solution, the Indian Army entered Portuguese India and defeated the Portuguese garrisons there. The Portuguese took the matter to the Security Council but a resolution calling on India to withdraw its troops immediately was defeated by the USSR's veto. Portugal surrendered on 19 December. This take-over ended the last of the European colonies in India. Goa was incorporated into India as a centrally administered union territory and, in 1987, became a state. =Sikkim= The former princely state of Sikkim, located at a strategically important point on the border between India and China, was integrated into India in 1975 as its 22nd state. Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim were Himalayan states bordering India. Nepal had been recognised by the British by Nepal‚ÄìBritain Treaty of 1923 as being de jure independent and not a princely state. Bhutan had in the British period been considered a protectorate outside the international frontier of India. The Government of India entered into a treaty with Bhutan in 1949 continuing this arrangement, and providing that Bhutan would abide by the advice of the Government of India in the conduct of its external affairs. After 1947, India signed new treaties with Nepal and Bhutan. Historically, Sikkim was a British dependency, with a status similar to that of the other princely states, and was therefore considered to be within the frontiers of India in the colonial period. On independence, however, the Chogyal of Sikkim resisted full integration into India. Given the region's strategic importance to India, the Government of India signed first a Standstill Agreement and then in 1950 a full treaty with the Chogyal of Sikkim which in effect made it a protectorate which was no longer part of India. India had responsibility for defence, external affairs and communications, and ultimate responsibility for law and order, but Sikkim was otherwise given full internal autonomy.; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal, supported by the minority Bhutia and Lepcha upper classes, attempted to negotiate greater powers, particularly over external affairs, to give Sikkim more of an international personality. These policies were opposed by Kazi Lhendup Dorji and the Sikkim State Congress, who represented the ethnic Nepali middle classes and took a more pro-Indian view. In April 1973, anti-Chogyal agitation broke out and protestors demanded popular elections. The Sikkim police were unable to control the demonstrations, and Dorji asked India to exercise its responsibility for law and order and intervene. India facilitated negotiations between the Chogyal and Dorji, and produced an agreement, which envisaged the reduction of the Chogyal to the role of a constitutional monarch and the holding of elections based on a new ethnic power-sharing formula. The Chogyal's opponents won an overwhelming victory, and a new Constitution was drafted providing for Sikkim to be associated with the Republic of India. On 10 April 1975, the Sikkim Assembly passed a resolution calling for the state to be fully integrated into India. This resolution was endorsed by 97 percent of the vote in a referendum held on 14 April 1975, following which the Indian Parliament amended the constitution to admit Sikkim into India as its 22nd state. =Secessionism and sub-nationalism= While the majority of princely states absorbed into India have been fully integrated, a few outstanding issues remain. The most prominent of these is in relation to Kashmir, where a violent secessionist insurgency has been raging since the late 1980s. Some academics suggest that the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly a result of the manner in which it was integrated into India. Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for. Instead, the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir. The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active insurgency. Separatist movements also exist in two other former princely states located in Northeast India‚ÄîTripura and Manipur. These separatist movements are generally treated by scholars as being part of the broader problem of insurgencies in North-east India, rather being a result of specific problems in integrating the princely states into India, as the Kashmir problem is and, in particular, to reflect the failure of the Government of India to adequately address the aspirations of tribal groups in the Northeast, or to tackle the tensions arising from the immigration of people from other parts of India to the north-eastern areas.See e.g. ; ; The integration of former princely states with other provinces to form new states has also given rise to some issues. The Telangana region, comprising the Telugu-speaking districts of the former Hyderabad State, were in many ways different from the Telugu-speaking areas of British India with which they were merged. In recognition of these differences, the States Reorganisation Commission originally recommended that Telangana be created as a separate state, rather than as part of a broader Telugu-speaking entity. This recommendation was rejected by the Government of India, and Telangana was merged into Andhra Pradesh. The result was the emergence in the 1960s of a movement demanding a separate Telangana state. The demand has been accepted by the Union Government, leading to formation of Telangana as the 29th state of India in June 2014. A similar movement, although less strong, exists in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, which consists of the former Nagpur state and the Berar region of the former Hyderabad state. Critical perspectives on the process of integration The integration process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported the right of the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan‚Äîwhich India refused to recognise‚Äîand the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory. Different theories have been proposed to explain the designs of Indian and Pakistani leaders in this period. Rajmohan Gandhi postulates that an ideal deal working in the mind of Patel was that if Muhammad Ali Jinnah let India have Junagadh and Hyderabad, Patel would not object to Kashmir acceding to Pakistan. In his book Patel: A Life, Gandhi asserts that Jinnah sought to engage the questions of Junagadh and Hyderabad in the same battle. It is suggested that he wanted India to ask for a plebiscite in Junagadh and Hyderabad, knowing thus that the principle then would have to be applied to Kashmir, where the Muslim-majority would, he believed, vote for Pakistan. A speech by Patel at the Bahauddin College in Junagadh following the latter's take-over, where he said that \\"we would agree to Kashmir if they agreed to Hyderabad\\", suggests that he may have been amenable to this idea. Although Patel's opinions were not India's policy, nor were they shared by Nehru, both leaders were angered at Jinnah's courting the princes of Jodhpur, Bhopal and Indore, leading them to take a harder stance on a possible deal with Pakistan. Modern historians have also re-examined the role of the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the accession process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion. Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a moral obligation to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, one of the reasons why the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option.; Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century‚Äîunite all of India under one rule.; See also *All Indian States People's Conference Notes Further reading         online free       Singh, Buta. \\"Role of Sardar Patel in the Integration of Indian States.\\" Calcutta Historical Journal (July-Dec 2008) 28#2 pp 65‚Äì78.  * * , translated by Latika Padgaonkar  * * Category:Constitutional history of India Category:History of the Republic of India Category:Nehru administration Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Political integration of India"},{"id":"3421043","text":"Shield of arms of Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley, KG, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel. Henry Richard Charles Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley, (17 June 1804 ‚Äì 15 July 1884), known as The Lord Cowley between 1847 and 1857, was a British diplomat. He served as British Ambassador to France between 1852 and 1867.  Background and education  Wellesley was born in 1804 in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, the eldest son of Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley, and Lady Charlotte, daughter of Charles Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan. He was a nephew of the 1st Duke of Wellington and the 1st Marquess Wellesley. He was educated at Eton and Brasenose College, Oxford.  Diplomatic career  Wellesley entered the diplomatic service in 1824, receiving his first important appointment in 1845, when he became Minister Plenipotentiary to the Ottoman Empire.Haydn, Joseph. The Book of Dignities: Containing Lists of the Official Personages of the British Empire. London: Longman Brown Green, 1851 pp.83-4. This was followed in June 1851 by his appointment as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the reinstated diet of the German Confederation, a position which he only held for a short time, as he was chosen in 1852 to succeed Lord Normanby as the British Ambassador in Paris. Lord Cowley, as Wellesley had become on his father's death in 1847, held this important post for fifteen years, and the story of his diplomatic life in Paris cannot be separated from the general history of England and France. As Minister during the greater part of the reign of Napoleon III, he conducted the delicate negotiations between the two countries during the time of those eastern complications which preceded and followed the Crimean War, and also during the excitement and unrest produced by the attempt made in 1858 by Felice Orsini to assassinate the Emperor of the French; while his diplomatic skill was no less in evidence during the war between France and Austria and the subsequent course of events in Italy. In 1857 he was created Viscount Dangan, in the County of Meath, and Earl Cowley. He was further honoured in 1866 when he was made a Knight of the Garter. Having assisted Richard Cobden to conclude the commercial treaty between Great Britain and France in 1860, he retired as ambassador in 1867.  Family  Lord Cowley married on 22 October 1833 the Honourable Olivia Cecilia at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, Berkshire, (Olivia d. 1885), daughter of Lord Henry FitzGerald (fourth son of the 1st Duke of Leinster) and the 20th Baroness de Ros, by whom he had three sons and two daughters, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, William Cowley, Viscount Dangan. One of his daughters, Lady Feodorowna Cecilia Wellesley (1838‚Äì1920), married Francis Bertie, a British diplomat and a future British ambassador to France. In 1863 Cowley inherited the former Long family estate of Draycot Cerne in Wiltshire from his kinsman the 5th Earl of Mornington, and he retired four years later.

This ban would include products such as polystyrene foam carry-out containers and carry-out cups which have many substitutes including traditional plastics, cardboard, and paper. = Democracy = The Democracy campaign focuses primarily on expanding voter access and diminishing the effect of special interest money in elections. The campaign has largely focused its efforts on passing state and local legislation that create Publicly funded elections programs. The campaign has also focused on Automatic Voter Registration and Election Day Registration. The Democracy campaign also works to register students to vote in their New Voters Project (NVP). The project entails setting up tables on the University of Maryland, College Park campus where individuals can register to vote ahead of primary or general elections. = Textbook Affordability = The Textbooks campaign addresses the issue of the high costs of required college textbooks. The campaign is attempted to establish a textbook exchange program where the books can be matched and traded. It has since shift its focus to raise awareness and increase adoption of Open Source textbooks and Open Educational Resources (OER). The campaign has also focused its efforts on Pell Grant programs for textbooks. = Antibiotics = The Antibiotics campaign focuses on the overuse of antibiotics. The campaign aims to \\"save antibiotics\\" by educating the public about them and working with businesses to reduce their overuse. = Hunger and Homelessness = The Hunger and Homelessness campaign aims to prevent hunger in Maryland and to provide aid to homeless individuals. The campaign has raised money from University of Maryland students to provide homeless shelters with hygienic products and food. = Past Campaigns = * Save the Bees * Toxins  Achievements  = Since 2016 = * Contributed to state-wide fracking ban in Maryland * Secured $5 million from Congress for an Open Textbook Pilot program that will save students an estimated $50 million in textbook costs * Persuaded Subway (restaurant), McDonald's, and KFC to stop selling meat raised with the routine use of antibiotics in order to protect life-saving drugs * Registered 3,500 students to vote in 2016 elections * Small donor matching program in Howard County, Maryland * Small donor matching program in Montgomery County, Maryland * Helped prevent a proposed $2.6 billion cut to Pell Grant funding * Helped raise thousands of dollars for those impacted by Hurricane Maria * Contributed to passage of Pollinator Protection Act in Maryland Category:Public Interest Research Groups Category:Government watchdog groups in the United States Public Interest Research Group Category:Political advocacy groups in the United States Category:University of Maryland, College Park research projects Category:University of Maryland, College Park student organizations ","title":"Maryland Public Interest Research Group"},{"id":"3421103","text":"Wath Central railway station was on the South Yorkshire Railway's Doncaster - Barnsley Exchange line in England.

The most original aspect of the Avioplan was the shape of its fuselage, designed for minimum aerodynamic drag and acting as a tube fan, increasing the efficiency of the propeller. The Avioplan's design was similar to that of modern vertical-take-off-and-landing (VTOL) aircraft and helicopters. Goliescu built a model of the Avioplan with a length of in 1909, achieving a takeoff angle of 30 degrees with it. Assisted by the Romanian Minister of Education, Spiru Haret, who also helped Aurel Vlaicu, Goliescu went to France in 1909 to acquire an engine for his aircraft. He patented his invention in France (patent no. 402329). While in Paris, he submitted a survey he had written, \\"Laws of air dynamics,\\" to the French Academy of Sciences, and the French magazine La France automobile et a√©rienne (France Automobile and Air) published it in its edition of 15 May 1909. In 1909, Goliescu learned to fly and built an updated version of the Avioplan, this time in full size. The aircraft had a half-cylinder fuselage, but air from the propeller flowed through it as it had in the first model. He flew the Avioplan for the first time in November 1909, at Juvisy airfield near Paris, and reached an altitude of about . It was the first flight by an aircraft with a tubed propeller. After his flights, aircraft designers did not pursue his tubed propeller idea again until 1932, when the Italian engineer Luigi Stipa built the Stipa- Caproni aircraft with a \\"barrel fuselage.\\" The tubed-propeller design finally reached its full potential after World War II, when aircraft designers successfully implemented it in helicopters, like the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin and the RAH-66 Comanche, and in the X-35 experimental aircraft which gave rise to the F-35 Lightning II fighter. Between 1932 and 1936, Goliescu flight tested his \\"Aviocoleopter\\", the first VTOL aircraft.

She murdered at least five people by poisoning them. One of her victims was her second husband, Michael Gilligan; the others were residents of her nursing home. It is possible that she was involved in more deaths. The authorities counted 48 deaths in her nursing home, the \\"Archer Home for the Elderly and Infirm.\\" The case attracted wide publicity at the time and has been cited as an inspiration for the play Arsenic and Old Lace and for Frank Capra's later film of the same name. Childhood and marriages Amy E. Duggan was born on October 31, 1873 to James Duggan and Mary Kennedy in Milton, Connecticut, the eighth of ten children.1870 US Census of Litchfield, Connecticut, p. 73; 1880 US Census of Litchfield, Connecticut; 1900 US Census of Litchfield, Connecticut, sheet 18B; 1900 US Census of Litchfield, Connecticut, sheet 24A; 1910 US Census of Windsor, Connecticut, p. 18. She attended the Milton School and the New Britain Normal School in 1890. Amy Duggan married James Archer in 1897. A daughter, Mary J. Archer, was born in December 1897. The Archers first became caretakers in 1901, hired to care for John Seymour, an elderly widower. They moved into his home in Newington, Connecticut. Seymour died in 1904. His heirs converted the residence into a boarding house for the elderly, and the Archers remained to provide care for the elderly for a fee. They paid rent to Seymour's family. They ran the boarding house as Sister Amy's Nursing Home for the Elderly. In 1907, Seymour's heirs decided to sell the house. The Archers moved to Windsor, Connecticut, and used their savings to purchase their own residence on Prospect Street in Windsor Center. They soon converted it into a business, Archer Home for the Elderly and Infirm. James Archer died in 1910, apparently of natural causes. The official cause of his death was Bright's disease, a generic term for kidney diseases. Amy Archer had taken out an insurance policy on him a few weeks before his death. The policy benefit enabled her to continue operating Archer Home. In 1913, Amy married Michael W. Gilligan, a widower with four adult sons.1900 US Census of Windsor, Connecticut, sheet 8A; 1910 US Census of Windsor, Connecticut, p. 12. He was reportedly wealthy and interested in both Amy and in investing in the Archer Home. However, on February 20, 1914, after only three months married to Amy, Michael died. The official cause of death was \\"acute bilious attack\\" (in other words, severe indigestion). Amy was once again financially secure because during their short marriage her new husband had drawn up a will which left his entire estate to her. The will would later be determined a forgery as it was apparently written in handwriting matching Amy Archer-Gilligan. Murders Between 1907 and 1917, there were 60 deaths in the Archer Home. Relatives of her clients grew suspicious as they tallied the large number of deaths. Only 12 residents died between 1907 and 1910, but 48 residents died between 1911 and 1916. Among them was Franklin R. Andrews, an apparently healthy man. On the morning of May 29, 1914, Andrews was doing some gardening in the Archer house. His robust physical condition deteriorated in a single day and he was dead by evening. The official cause of death was gastric ulcer. After Andrews' siblings (including Nellie Pierce) came into possession of some of his letters, they noted occasions where Amy Archer-Gilligan was pressing their brother for money. Amy's clients showed a pattern of dying not long after giving her a large sum of money. As the deaths continued, Nellie Pierce reported her suspicions to the local district attorney, but he mostly ignored her. So she took her story to The Hartford Courant. On May 9, 1916, the first of several articles on the \\"Murder Factory\\" was published. A few months later, the police started to seriously investigate the case. The investigation took almost a year to complete. The bodies of Gilligan, Andrews, and three other boarders were exhumed. All five had died of poisoning, either arsenic or strychnine. Local merchants were able to testify that Amy had been purchasing large quantities of arsenic, supposedly to \\"kill rats\\". A look into Gilligan's will established that it was actually a forgery written by Amy. According to M. William Phelps, author of The Devil's Rooming House, investigation appeared to show that Amy was buying the arsenic to kill large numbers of rats. However, it appears that she did not buy all of the arsenic which killed her patients. The doctor and some of the patients had signed off to purchase it. The investigation pursued Dr. King because more evidence was piling up against him, but suspicions were focused back on Amy when someone suggested to clearly check all records of arsenic purchases. When evidence was found of Amy sending her patients to the drugstore to buy quantities of arsenic, the police were able to arrest and convict her.  Trials  Archer-Gilligan was arrested and tried for murder, originally on five counts. Ultimately her lawyer managed to have the charges reduced to a single count, the murder of Franklin R. Andrews. On June 18, 1917, a jury found her guilty, and she was sentenced to death. Archer-Gilligan appealed and was granted a new trial in 1919. At this trial, she pleaded insanity. Mary Archer testified that her mother was addicted to morphine. Archer-Gilligan was again found guilty of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment.  Death  In 1924, Archer-Gilligan was declared to be temporarily insane and was transferred to the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane in Middletown, where she remained until her death on April 23, 1962. Media =Television= Archer-Gilligan was mentioned on the police procedure crime drama Criminal Minds, in the season five episode \\"The Uncanny Valley\\".

Each chapter describes a different world and the society that inhabits it; these societies share similarities with Earth's cultures in some respects, but may be notably dissimilar in other respects. Many of the chapters are brief vignettes or ethnographic profiles of the societies they describe. Changing Planes won the Locus Award for best collection in 2004. Conception and analysis The conceit of the collection, described in the first story, \\"Sita Dulip's Method\\", is based on a pun that ties the book together: that the low-level discomfort of forced occupation of an airport while changing planes can, in fact, cause one to change from one \\"plane\\" of reality to another. Because of the different flow of time in other planes, one can spend a week visiting another plane and return in time to make a connecting flight. One scholar notes that the stories explore an underlying, unifying theme around the \\"inherent difficulties in translations and understanding other cultures.\\"Bernardo, Susan M. & Murphy, Graham J.

It was often the welcoming beacon to persons returning to England, where on a clear night, the reflected light could be seen away. History A light was first exhibited here in 1619, built thanks to the efforts of Sir Christopher Dimaline but it was extinguished and the tower demolished in 1630 because of difficulties in raising funds for its operation and maintenance. The current lighthouse, consisting of two towers with cottages between them, was built in 1751 by the landowner Thomas Fonnereau; each tower was topped by a coal-fired brazier. Trinity House took responsibility for the installation in 1771. In 1812 the coal burners on each tower were replaced with Argand lamps and reflectors. In each tower a fixed arrangement of nineteen lamps and reflectors was installed. In 1873 the original lamps and reflectors were still in use. That year, because of the number of wrecks still occurring around the Point, the decision was taken to upgrade the lights and provide a fog signal. Therefore, in 1874, the site was significantly changed by the building of an engine room to provide electric power, not only for the lights but also for a fog siren. The engine room was equipped with three 10 hp caloric engines by A & F Brown of New York, driving six Siemens dynamo-electric machines, which in turn powered an arc lamp in each tower; (caloric engines were used because there was no nearby source of fresh water for steam power). At the same time a pair of medium-sized (third-order) fixed catadioptric optics were installed, one on each tower, designed by John Hopkinson of Chance Brothers. The siren was in use from January 1878; it sounded (one blast every five minutes) through a horizontal horn which was installed on the roof of the engine house and could be moved depending on the prevailing wind direction. The new electric lights were first lit on 29 March that same year. In 1885 the Siemens dynamos were replaced by a pair of more powerful de M√©ritens magneto-electric generators. In 1903 there were further changes when a large four-panel rotating optic, manufactured by Chance Brothers, was installed in the eastern tower and both the lantern and light on the western tower were removed (it was announced that this 'new revolving light of very great power' would be 'visible at a distance of between 40 and 50 miles').Engineering journal, quoted by Renton (2001). In 1908 a new pair of sirens were installed (sounding out to sea through twin 'trumpets' on the roof of the engine house) and a trio of Hornsby oil engines replaced the caloric engines . Soon afterwards an underwater bell was set up two miles south of the Lizard, operated by an electric striker controlled from the lighthouse via a submarine cable. A carbon arc lamp continued to provide the light source until it was superseded in 1926 by an electric filament lamp,Plaque on magneto machine which enabled a reduction in the number of personnel at the lighthouse from five to three.'Lighthouses' in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1961 edition, volume 14. The engines and magneto generators continued in daily use until 1950, when the lighthouse was connected to mains electricity. In that year four Gardner diesel engines were installed, three to run compressors for the fog signal, the other linked to a pair of generators for use in the event of a mains power failure. In March 1954 the lighthouse keeper and assistants were able to put out a fire that was started in the exhaust pits of the engines providing the electric power. In 1998, Lizard Lighthouse was automated and demanned. The fog horn was decommissioned in 1998 and replaced with an automatic electronic fog signal; at the time it was the last compressed-air fog signal still in use in the United Kingdom. The machinery is still in place and it is still occasionally sounded to mark special occasions. The rotating optic continues in use to this day. Lighthouse Heritage Centre Opened in 2009 with a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Lizard Lighthouse Heritage Centre is located in the lighthouse engine room, which still features some of the original engines. Interactive exhibits and displays focus on the history of the lighthouse, the life of a lighthouse keeper, and the role of lighthouses in sea safety. Currently, the buildings around the site are being used as holiday cottages. =Generator= One of the lighthouse's former generators is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum;Birmingham Museums Trust accession record 1954S00295 it carries a plate marked: The other is still in situ in the engine house.

Having participated in the Velebit uprising in 1932, he joined the Royal Italian Army and returned to Croatia following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. He fought with the Usta≈°e until the end of the war, when he is reported to have evaded the Yugoslav Partisans and reached the Austrian town of Bleiburg. Nothing is known of what happened to him afterwards, and it was rumoured that he was either killed in Podravina in 1945, died fighting with the Crusaders in Herzegovina in 1947, or, less likely, emigrated to the United States via Argentina, joined the United States Army and fought Communist forces in the Korean War. In 1951, he was named the Croatian Minister of Defence in-exile by Usta≈°e leader Ante Paveliƒá. Early life Rafael Boban was born on 22 December 1907 in the village of Soviƒái, near the town of Grude, Austria-Hungary. He was a Roman Catholic Herzegovinian Croat. He served as an officer in the Royal Yugoslav Army prior to joining Usta≈°e units based in Italy in the summer of 1932. In September 1932, he returned to Croatia and participated in the Usta≈°e-led Velebit uprising against Yugoslav rule. Afterwards, he traveled to Italian-controlled Zadar to request Italian citizenship and protection. In May 1934, Usta≈°e leader Ante Paveliƒá promoted Boban to the rank of sergeant in the Usta≈°e and he became a member of Paveliƒá's inner circle. The following year, Boban became a deputy commander of a Royal Italian Army company based in Lipari before being transferred to Calabria. At the beginning of December 1937, Italian authorities arrested him and other members of the Usta≈°e on suspicion that they were planning to assassinate Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Stojadinoviƒá. They were all quickly released. World War II With the creation of the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH) in April 1941, Boban returned to Croatia and joined the Usta≈°e Militia.

On 24 July 1941 Boban commanded a group of Usta≈°e from Meƒëugorje and ƒåitluk that imprisoned 20 Serb villagers from village Baƒáeviƒái and killed them in Meƒëugorje, disposing their bodies in a nearby pit.:\\"Dvadeset ƒçetvrtog jula stradali su odrasli mu≈°karci sela Baƒáeviƒáa.

Boban assumed full command of the legion following Francetiƒá's death in December 1942. Usta≈°e propaganda declared him Francetiƒá's natural successor. The legion operated in various parts of the NDH under his command. Boban was promoted to the rank of general in December 1944 and became the head of the Podravina- based Fifth Usta≈°e Active Brigade of the Croatian Armed Forces that month.See: * ; * . That autumn, he was responsible for guarding the imprisoned politicians Mladen Lorkoviƒá and Ante Vokiƒá in the town of Koprivnica. He held the rank of colonel within the Usta≈°e Militia by April 1945. In May, he withdrew with the Usta≈°e towards Austria and is reported to have successfully reached the town of Bleiburg, alongside Paveliƒá and Vjekoslav Luburiƒá. Many theories exist about what happened to him. One theory states that he was killed in Podravina in 1945, while another states that he either died fighting with the Crusaders in Herzegovina in 1947 or that he emigrated to the United States via Argentina, joined the United States Army and fought Communist forces in the Korean War. Legacy In 1951, Boban was named the Croatian Minister of Defence in-exile by Paveliƒá. During the Bosnian War, a brigade of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) was named after him. The Roman Catholic church in the Herzegovinian village of Bobani is decorated with his pictures.

The main thoroughfare in the neighbourhood is Tsar Boris III Boulevard. Until 1910, Krasno selo was a mahala (neighbourhood) of Boyana. In 1956, it became a district of Sofia, but it had been a suburb of the city since the early 20th century. The name stems from the common noun selo (\\"village\\") and the adjective krasno, meaning either \\"beautiful\\". After the Second Balkan War and the First World War thousands of families of Bulgarian refugees (mainly from Western Thrace, Vardar Macedonia, Southern Dobruja and the Western Outlands) headed to the large Bulgarian cities in search of a better life. During that period prior to the Second World War Krasno selo, once a satellite neighbourhood, urbanized quickly and accommodated many refugee families, with various parts of Krasno selo today known as the Dobrujan neighbourhood, the Tsaribrod neighbourhood, etc. Architectural elements in the houses of Bulgarian refugees show a nostalgia for their native regions, an example of which is the round tower of a 1929 house reminiscent of the White Tower in Thessaloniki. The growth of Krasno selo was aided by the geographical importance of the western transport corridor leading to Pernik. One of the first tramways of the Balkans, then known as Knyazhevska, was officially opened on 1 January 1901 along what is today Tsar Boris III Boulevard. There is a possibility that a subway route may pass through the neighbourhood in the future. The architecture of Krasno selo is made of mostly residential buildings. The largest portion of residential structures are of the type Soviet era panel buildings. Newer residential buildings date to the period after 1990. These structures are made of brick and are only several stories high. The panel buildings, on the other hand, vary in height from five to over twenty stories. Krasno Selo is home to the Krasno Selo market. The second largest market is Borovo. Borovo is located at the end stop of trolley #9. The 1‚Äì12 grade school within the limits of the Krasno selo neighborhood is 142 SOU.

Anastase Dragomir, born 6 February 1896 in BrƒÉila, Romania, was the sixth child of his family. He worked in France at several aircraft factories where he perfected a system to save pilots and passengers in case of accidents. On 3 November 1928 he applied for French patent #678566, \\"Nouveau syst√®me de montage des parachutes dans les appareils de locomotion a√©rienne\\". Issued on 2 April 1930, the invention was, \\"a new system of parachuting from the apparatus for air locomotion, each passenger having his own parachute that allows, in critical moments, the assembly detaching from the plane, so the parachute with seated passenger passes through an opening.\\" After several attempts, Dragomir managed to obtain financing and began construction of his \\"catapulted cockpit\\". The invention was tested in a Farman airplane piloted by Lucien Bossoutrot at Paris-Orly, France airport on 28 August 1929. French newspapers later reported on the invention's success. Dragomir returned home to Romania after the Paris-Orly experiment where, with Romanian aviation engineer captain Constantin Nicolau, he successfully repeated the experiment in an Avia airplane at BƒÉneasa Airport in Bucharest, Romania on 26 October 1929. He continued to refine his invention and obtained Romanian patent #40658 in 1950 for his \\"parachuted cell\\".

It is the only high school of Ball Chatham Community Unit School District 5, which is in southern Sangamon County and includes Chatham, Glenarm, and the southern portion of Springfield, Illinois. History =Ball Township= Ball Township High School, sometimes called Ball Township Community High School, opened in September 1923 with 35 students; 2 seniors graduated at the end of the 1923-1924 school year. The school was established on New City Road, approximately four miles east of Chatham, three miles north and one mile east of Glenarm. There were numerous additions to the original school building, including the 1935 gymnasium. Ball Township graduated 21 seniors in May 1948, after which it picked up all the students from Chatham High School. The first combined Ball Township graduating class, under Ball Chatham Community Unit School District 5, was 34 seniors in May 1949. The last Ball Township High School graduating class was 1956, with 43 students; students moved to the first Glenwood High School when it opened in March 1957. Since then various combinations of grades have used the Ball Township site. The original 1924 section of the school was torn down in June 2013, but newer sections remain and continue to be used as Ball Elementary School. =Chatham= The Caldwell School was a combination grade school and high school built in 1895, paid for by local resident Ben Franklin Caldwell, who later became a state representative and state senator in the Illinois General Assembly and afterwards a congressman. The 1895 schoolhouse burnt down in 1904, and a new one built in 1905. Chatham High School, operating in this Caldwell School, was a recognized 4-year high school until 1919; it was reduced to 2 years from 1919 to May 1924, then extended to 3 years from 1924 to 1938. In 1938, Chatham High School became a 4-year high school again, with its own new building that cost $32,000. Chatham ended as a high school in May 1948, with 34 students, of which 8 were graduating seniors. Upon consolidation into Ball Chatham Community Unit School District 5 in 1948, students went to Ball Township High School. =Glenwood= Academic statistics Glenwood High School (GHS), based on the 2008 PSAE scores, was ranked in the top 50 high schools in Illinois. All students in Illinois are required to take the SAT exam during their junior year in high school. The SAT examination is optional, and few students elect to take this test. In 2008, though, one GHS student scored 2350 and was a National Merit Scholar. Academic averages are: ACT * Composite: 22.2 * English: 21.7 * Math: 21.6 * Reading: 22.9 * Science: 22.2 PSAE Meets/Exceeds * Reading: 63.3% * Math: 60.7% * Writing: 67.0% * Science: 63.5% * Social Studies: 63.4% Sports Glenwood participates in various Illinois High School Association (IHSA) sports, including: baseball (boys), basketball (boys' teams and girls' teams), competitive cheerleading (girls' teams and boys/girls team), competitive dance team (girls), cross country (boys/girls), football (boys), golf (boys' teams and girls' teams), soccer (boys' teams and girls' teams), softball (girls), swimming (boys' teams and girls' teams), tennis (boys' teams and girls' teams), track & field (boys' teams and girls' teams), volleyball (girls), wrestling (boys), Mock Trial, Show Choir, Speech, and Scholastic Bowl. The school also participates in ice hockey competition outside the IHSA. The mascot of Glenwood High is the Titans. The previous mascot, the Redskins, was changed to the more culturally sensitive \\"Titans\\" by the school district in August 2001, upon the opening of the new high-school facility. This action upset some Chatham residents who had previously defeated several referendums seeking to change the Redskin mascot. Television programming Glenwood High School also offers news and sports coverage that goes under the name GCNN, which is short for Glenwood Cable News Network. This program was founded in 1984. Programs include the weekly sports show known as \\"The Rush\\" and daily news known as the \\"First Five\\". The network is also known for Live Sports, which include Football and Basketball.gcnn.net In early 2014 GCNN Coordinator, Ryan Bandy, announced his resignation after the calendar school year. The long lasting program came to a close in 2016 after low attendance numbers and district wide budget cuts.

In 406 BC, he was sent to the Aegean to take command of the Spartan fleet from Lysander, the first navarch. Biography Callicratidas's tenure as navarch was short, and he encountered a number of difficulties. Chief among these were the intrigues of his predecessor, who had apparently returned the money from which the fleet was supposed to be paid for to its source, the Persian prince Cyrus. Callicratidas needed money from Cyrus to pay his men, but, as a traditionalist Spartan, he was loath to request it from a Persian. His halfhearted attempts to secure funding from Cyrus fell through, and he was forced to find an alternative source of funds, which the city of Miletus eventually provided. After winning an initial victory against the Athenian admiral Conon, Callicratidas came up against a sizable Athenian force sent out to relieve Conon. He met this force at the battle of Arginusae in 406 BC. His force was soundly defeated, and Callicratidas himself was killed. After his death, Lysander returned from Sparta to again take up the post of navarch. Callicratidas is remembered as a Spartan of the old school. He disdained the policy of alliance with Persia that had come into favor under Lysander, and he stated that if the choice were his, he would seek peace with Athens. The increasing role of money in Spartan politics and diplomacy offended his traditionalist, antimaterialist sensibilities. Although unsuccessful in his command, he won the respect of many Spartans and allies, and was well regarded after his death. Pseudo-Callicratidas Callicratidas is not to be confused with Pseudo-Callicratidas, the pseudonymous author of the Neo-Pythagorean treatise On the Felicity of Families.Callicratidas - Brill Online Reference Works The treatise puts forward the idea that remarked that a wife's wealth may thwart her husband's rule.Korinna Zamfir, Men and Women in the Household of God: A Contextual Approach to Roles and Ministries in the Pastoral Epistle, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2013, pp. 374‚Äì5.

It is a large, conical burial mound that was part of at least six episodes of burials. It measured about and . It contained roughly 1,150 sets of remains that were placed. However, they were able to be fit into the structure of the mound. Sometimes body parts were removed in order to achieve that goal. Archaeologists think it was a holding house for the area that was emptied periodically in order to achieve this type of setup. Most of the time, the people were just placed into the mound, but a few of the burials were in log-lined tombs or, rarely, stone- lined tombs. Only a few out of each burial were interred with copper tools as grave goods. This suggests that the area was mainly for common people to be buried in. The site is on private land, usually with no public access, but it can be viewed from the roadway. Description There were two separate mounds that make up the site. In 1938‚Äì1939 the site was completely excavated under the direction of James A. Ford. The mounds were southeast of French Fork Bayou and southwest of Cypress Bayou. Mound A was a conical mound that stood in height and in diameter. Mound B is low rectangular mound located southwest of Mound A. It was originally in height and measured in its northeast/southwest alignment and in its northwest/southeast alignment. Excavations revealed that Mound A had been built in three stages; Mound B was a single-stage structure. The mounds held 1,175 burials: 1,159 from Mound A, and 13 from Mound B (3 unknown). Pottery accompanied some burials; the weight of mound fill apparently crushed the vessels. The mounds were used for burials around 100 BCE to 400 CE. No evidence for domestic structures exists on or near the mounds, leading archaeologists to believe they were strictly for mortuary purposes. References *Fagan, Brian M. Ancient North America 2005.

He was a professor of physics at Duke University. Along with Yoichiro Nambu of the University of Chicago, he is credited with introducing the SU(3) symmetry of quarks, today known as the color charge. The color charge is the basis of the strong force as explained by quantum chromodynamics. Early life and career Han was born in Seoul, Korea. He emigrated to the US after the Korean War to attend Carroll College. He received his Ph.D from the University of Rochester in 1964 and joined the physics faculty at Duke University, Durham NC in 1967. He is survived by his wife, three children and an array of grandchildren. Career Han received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1964 from the University of Rochester. Han's research specialty is in the field of theoretical particle physics, with an emphasis on the symmetry principles of elementary particle physics. Han and Yoichiro Nambu of the University of Chicago first introduced a new hidden symmetry among quarks in 1965. This is the origin of the color SU(3) symmetry, distinct from the symmetry among hadrons which is the flavor SU(3). This SU(3) symmetry is the basis for the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which is now the standard theory for the strong nuclear force sector of the Standard Model. Nambu shared 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for a related work on applying the mechanism of spontaneously broken symmetry, enabling the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. From 1993 to 1995, Han served as the inaugurating Chair of the Outstanding Young Researcher Award (OYRA) Committee of AKPA. He is a recipient of the 1998 Global Korea Award by the Council on Korean Studies of the Michigan State University. He delivered the keynote address at the 2001 Asian Pacific Heritage Month Celebration at the US-Environmental Protection Agency in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina in May, 2001. The title of his keynote address was \\"The New New World.\\" Han is the founding Chairman of the Society of Korean-American Scholars (SKAS) and since then, he has served as its Editor-in-Chief n SKAS. He publishes two alternating weekly electronic newsletters, KASTN and IEKAS, the Korean American Science and Technology News and the Information Exchange for Korean American Scholars. In the fall of 2008, Han left the University of California at Merced and delivered a special seminar explaining the spontaneously broken symmetry of Y. Nambu that earned Nambu the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Leaving the Seoul National University in Korea in the fall of 2009, Han delivered a colloquium titled \\"Nambu and the Standard Model\\" and taught a special course titled \\"Physics for Humanities and Social Sciences Course.\\" In the fall of 2013, Han spent his time at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) in Daejeon, South Korea and completed his fifth and sixth books. He also served as an Adjunct Professor of Physics at KAIST.

Unlike mainstream psychology, DƒÖbrowski's theoretical framework views psychological tension and anxiety as necessary for growth. These \\"disintegrative\\" processes are therefore seen as \\"positive\\", whereas people who fail to go through positive disintegration may remain for their entire lives in a state of \\"primary integration\\", lacking true individuality. Advancing into disintegration and into the higher levels of development is predicated on having developmental potential, including overexcitabilities, above-average reactions to stimuli. Unlike some other theories of development such as Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels. TPD is not a theory of stages, and levels do not correlate with age. DƒÖbrowski's theory Kazimierz DƒÖbrowski (1902‚Äì1980), a Polish psychiatrist and psychologist, developed the Theory of Positive Disintegration which led to the 1964 publication of the eponymous book, \\"Positive Disintegration\\". He was heavily influenced by his Catholic upbringing which inspired personal sacrifice and intimated perpetual torment for some. He pursued a lifelong obsession with self-mutilation resulting in his semi-autobiographical 1937 work, \\"Psychological Basis of Self Mutilation.\\" His personal experience as a victim of medical torture for several months as a member of the Polish resistance, being only one of the 36 surviving psychiatrists in Poland out of the 400 practicing at the beginning of World War II, informed his world view. He believed that the key to the treatment of mental illness was intense personal suffering and hence singled out the self-infliction of suffering as essential to personal development. DƒÖbrowski's theory of personality development emphasised several major features including: * personality is not a given universal trait, it must be created--shaped--by the individual to reflect his or her own unique character (personality shaping) * personality develops as a result of the action of developmental potential (DP) (overexcitability and the autonomous factor), not everyone displays sufficient DP to create a unique personality. * developmental potential is represented in the population by a normal (bell) curve. DƒÖbrowski used a multilevel approach to describe the continuum of developmental levels seen in the population. * developmental potential creates crises characterized by strong anxieties and depressions--psychoneurosis--that precipitate disintegration * for personality to develop, initial integrations based on instinct and socialization must disintegrate--a process DƒÖbrowski called positive disintegration * the development of a hierarchy of individual values--emotional reactions--is a critical component in developing one's personality and one's autonomy, thus, in contrast to most psychological theories, emotions play a major role in this approach * emotional reactions guide the individual in creating his or her individual personality ideal, an autonomous standard that acts as the goal of individual development * the individual must examine his or her essence and subsequently make existential choices that emphasize those aspects of essence that are higher and \\"more myself\\" and inhibit those aspects that are lower or \\"less myself\\" based upon his or her own personality ideal * critical components of individual development include autoeducation and autopsychotherapy =Factors in personality development= DƒÖbrowski observed that most people live their lives in a state of \\"primary or primitive integration\\" largely guided by biological impulses (\\"first factor\\") and/or by uncritical endorsement and adherence to social conventions (\\"second factor\\"). He called this initial integration Level I. DƒÖbrowski observed that at this level there is no true individual expression of the autonomous human self. Individual expression at Level I is influenced and constrained by the first two factors. The first factor channels energy and talents toward accomplishing self-serving goals that reflect the \\"lower instincts\\" and biological ego‚Äîits primary focus is on survival and self-advancement. Often talents are used in antisocial or asocial ways. For example, at the lowest edge of Level I many criminals display this type of selfish behavior. They tend to advance their own goals at the expense of others. The second factor, the social environment (milieu) and peer pressure, constrains individual expression and creativity by encouraging a group view of life and discouraging individual thought and expression. The second factor externalizes values and morals, thereby externalizing conscience. Social forces shape expectations. Behavior and one's talents and creativity are funneled into forms that follow and support the existing social milieu. \\"My mom says we should always be aware of what our lawn looks like because we want other people to think well of us when they drive by.\\" Because conscience is derived from an external social context, so long as society holds ethical standards, people influenced by the second factor will behave ethically. However, if a society becomes corrupt, people strongly influenced by second factor will not dissent. Socialization without individual examination leads to a rote and robotic existence (the \\"robopath\\" described by Ludwig von Bertalanffy). Individual reactions are not unique, they are based upon social contexts (\\"I cry at funerals and laugh at weddings‚Äîeveryone does\\"). According to DƒÖbrowski, people primarily motivated by second factor represent a significant majority of the general population. DƒÖbrowski felt that our society was largely influenced by the two lower factors and could be characterized as operating at Level I. For example, our emphasis on corporate success (\\"a dog eat dog mentality\\") means that many CEOs operate on the basis of first factor‚Äîthey will quickly sacrifice another to enhance their own advancement. As well, our educational, political, corporate, and media systems are self-promoting and discourage real examination or individual autonomy‚Äîthe second factor. Alternatively, social justifications are often used: \\"of course I break the speed limit, everyone does.\\" Or a soldier may explain that he or she was simply \\"following orders\\". Thus, this external value system absolves the individual of any individual responsibility. DƒÖbrowski also described a group of people who display a different course: an individualized developmental pathway. Such people break away from an automatic, rote, socialized view of life (which DƒÖbrowski called negative adjustment) and are said to move into and through a series of personal disintegrations. DƒÖbrowski saw these disintegrations as a key element in the overall developmental process. Crises challenge our status quo and cause us to review our self, ideas, values, thoughts, ideals, etc. If development continues, one goes on to develop an individualized, conscious and critically evaluated hierarchical value structure (called positive adjustment). This hierarchy of values acts as a benchmark by which all things are now seen, and the higher values in our internal hierarchy come to direct our behavior (no longer based on external social mores). These higher, individual values characterize an eventual second integration reflecting individual autonomy and for DƒÖbrowski, mark the arrival of true human personality. At this level, each person develops his or her own vision of how life ought to be and lives it. This higher level is associated with strong individual approaches to problem solving and creativity. One's talents and creativity are applied in the service of these higher individual values and visions of how life could be‚Äîhow the world ought to be. The person expresses his or her \\"new\\" autonomous personality energetically through action, art, social change and so on. =Development potential= Advanced development is often seen in people who exhibit strong developmental potential (\\"DP\\"). Developmental potential represents a constellation of genetic features, expressed and mediated through environmental interaction. Many factors are incorporated in developmental potential but three major aspects are highlighted: overexcitability (OE), specific abilities and talents, and a strong drive toward autonomous growth, a feature DƒÖbrowski called the \\"third factor\\". Overexcitability The most evident aspect of developmental potential is overexcitability (OE), a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. The greater the OE, the more intense are the day-to-day experiences of life. DƒÖbrowski outlined five forms of OE: psychomotor, sensual, imaginational, intellectual, and emotional. These overexcitabilities, especially the latter three, often cause a person to experience daily life more intensely and to feel the extremes of the joys and sorrows of life profoundly. DƒÖbrowski studied human exemplars and found that heightened overexcitability was a key part of their developmental and life experience. These people are steered and driven by their value \\"rudder\\", their sense of emotional OE. Combined with imaginational and intellectual OE, these people have a powerful perception of the world. Although based in the nervous system, overexcitabilities come to be expressed psychologically through the development of structures that reflect the emerging autonomous self. The most important of these conceptualizations are dynamisms: biological or mental forces that control behavior and its development. Instincts, drives and intellectual processes combined with emotions are dynamisms. With advanced development, dynamisms increasingly reflect movement toward autonomy. Abilities and talents The second aspect of developmental potential, specific abilities and talents, tends to serve the person's developmental level. As outlined, people at lower levels use talents to support egocentric goals or to climb the social and corporate ladders. At higher levels, specific talents and abilities become an important force as they are channeled by the person's value hierarchy into expressing and achieving the person's vision of his or her ideal personality and his or her view of how the world ought to be. The third factor The third aspect of developmental potential (DP), which is simply referred to as 'the third factor', is a drive toward individual growth and autonomy. The third factor is critical as it applies one's talents and creativity toward autonomous expression, and second, it provides motivation to strive for more and to try to imagine and achieve goals currently beyond one's grasp. DƒÖbrowski was clear to differentiate third factor from free will. He felt that free will did not go far enough in capturing the motivating aspects that he attributed to third factor. For example, an individual can exercise free will and show little motivation to grow or change as an individual. Third factor specifically describes a motivation‚Äîa motivation to become one's self. This motivation is often so strong that in some situations we can observe that one needs to develop oneself and that in so doing, it places one at great peril. This feeling of \\"I've gotta be me\\" especially when it is \\"at any cost\\" and especially when it is expressed as a strong motivator for self-growth is beyond the usual conceptualization ascribed to free will. A person whose DP is high enough will generally undergo disintegration, despite any external social or family efforts to prevent it. A person whose DP is low will generally not undergo disintegration (or positive personality growth) even in a conducive environment. The notion that some people have an innate potential for development that is determined by a higher sensitivity or overexcitability (analogous to the first aspect of DP) and by a related tendency to develop individual differences and autonomy from the group (analogous to the third aspect of DP) was independently developed by Elaine Aron (see Highly sensitive person) (although Aron's approach is substantially different from DƒÖbrowski's). Developmental obstacles DƒÖbrowski called OE \\"a tragic gift\\" to reflect that the road of the person with strong OE is not a smooth or easy one. Potentials to experience great highs are also potentials to experience great lows. Similarly, potentials to express great creativity hold the likelihood of experiencing a great deal of personal conflict and stress. This stress both drives development and is a result of developmental conflicts, both intrapsychic and social. Suicide is a significant risk in the acute phases of this stress. The isolation often experienced by these people heightens the risk of self-harm. DƒÖbrowski advocated autopsychotherapy, educating the person about OEs and the disintegrative process to give him or her a context within which to understand intense feelings and needs. DƒÖbrowski suggested giving people support in their efforts to develop and find their own self-expression. Children and adults with high DP have to find and walk their own path, often at the expense of fitting in with their social peers and even with their families. At the core of autopsychotherapy is the awareness that no one can show anyone else the \\"right\\" path. Everyone has to find their own path for themselves. Alluding to the knights on the Grail Quest, the Jungian analyst, Joseph Campbell allegedly said: \\"If a path exists in the forest, don't follow it, for though it took someone else to the Grail, it will not take you there, because it is not your path\\". The levels The first and fifth levels are characterized by psychological integration, harmony, and little inner conflict. There is little internal conflict at Level I because just about every behavior is justified‚Äîit is either good for the individual and is therefore \\"right\\", or the individual's society endorses it and it is therefore \\"right\\". In either case, with a high level of confidence the individual acts as he or she perceives anyone else would, and does what anyone is \\"supposed to do\\". At Level V there is no internal conflict because what a person does is always in accord with their own internal sense of values. Of course, there is often external conflict at both Levels I and V. Levels II, III and IV describe various degrees and types of dis-integration and literal disease. DƒÖbrowski was very clear that the levels he presents \\"represent a heuristic device\\". In the process of development the structures of two or even three contiguous levels may exist side by side, although it must be understood that they exist in conflict. The conflict is resolved when one of the structures is eliminated, or at least comes under complete control of another structure. =Level I: Primary integration= As outlined above, the first level is called primitive or primary integration. People at this level are often influenced primarily by either prominent first factor (heredity/impulse) and/or second factor (social environment) forces. The majority of people at Level I are integrated at the environmental or social level (DƒÖbrowski called them average people); however, many also exhibit shades of both impulse and socialization. DƒÖbrowski distinguished the two subgroups of Level I by degree: \\"the state of primary integration is a state contrary to mental health. A fairly high degree of primary integration is present in the average person; a very high degree of primary integration is present in the psychopath\\". Marked by selfishness and egocentrism (both reticent and explicit), those at level one development generally seek self-fulfillment above all, justifying their pursuits through a sort of \\"it's all about me\\" thinking; or, more simply put, they adhere strongly to the phrase \\"the end justifies the means\\", sometimes disregarding the severity of the \\"means\\". Many people who are considered \\"leaders\\" often fall into this category. A vast majority of people either do not break down their primitive integration at all, or after a relatively short period of disintegration, usually experienced at the time of adolescence and early youth, end in a reintegration at the former level or in partial integration of some of the functions at slightly higher levels, without a transformation of the whole mental structure. Primary integration in the average person was proposed to be of a certain value due to its stability and predictability, and when accompanied by kindness and good-will, could represent persons who can provide support and stability to those experiencing disintegration. =Level II: Unilevel disintegration= The prominent feature of this level is an initial, brief and often intense crisis or series of crises. Crises are spontaneous and occur on only one level. These crises involve alternatives that may appear to be different but ultimately are on the same level. Unilevel disintegration occurs during developmental crises such as puberty or menopause, in periods of difficulty in handling some stressful external event, or under psychological and psychopathological conditions such as nervousness and psychoneurosis. Unilevel disintegration consists of processes on a single structural and emotional level; there is a prevalence of automatic dynamisms with only slight self-consciousness and self-control. Conflicts on the same level (horizontal) produce ambitendencies and ambivalences: the person is equally attracted by different but equivalent choices on the same level (ambitendencies) and is not able to decide what to do because he or she has no real preference between the choices (ambivalences). If developmental forces are strong enough, ultimately, the person is thrust into an existential crisis: one's social rationales no longer account for one's experiences and there are no alternative explanations. During this phase, existential despair is the predominant emotion. The resolution of this phase begins as individually chosen values begin to replace social mores that have been ingrained by rote and are integrated into a new hierarchy of personal values. These new values often conflict with the person's previous social values. Many of the status quo explanations for the \\"way things are,\\" learned through education and from the social order, collapse under conscious, individual scrutiny. This causes more conflicts focused on the person's analysis of his or her own reactions to the world at large and of the behavior of self and others. Common behaviors and the ethics of the prevailing social order come to be seen as inadequate, wrong or hypocritical. Positive maladjustment prevails. For DƒÖbrowski, these crises represent a strong potential for development toward personal growth and mental health. Using a positive definition, mental health reflects more than social conformity: it involves a careful, personal examination of the world and of one's values, leading to the development of an individual personality. Level II is a transitional period. DƒÖbrowski said you either fall back (reintegration on a lower level), end negatively, in suicide or psychosis or move ahead to Level III. The transition from Level II to Level III involves a fundamental shift that requires a phenomenal amount of energy. This period is the crossroads of development: from here one must either progress or regress. The struggle between DƒÖbrowski's three factors reflects this transitional crisis: \\"Do I follow my instincts (first factor), my teachings (second factor) or my heart (third factor)?\\" The developmental answer is to transform one's lower instincts (automatic reactions like anger) into positive motivation, to resist rote and social answers, and to listen to one's inner sense of what one ought to do. =Level III: Spontaneous multilevel disintegration= Level III describes a new type of conflict: a vertical conflict between two alternatives that are not simply different, but that exist on different levels. One is genuinely higher and the other is lower in comparison. These vertical conflicts initially arise from involuntary perceptions of higher versus lower choices in life. \\"You just look at something, maybe for the 1000th time (to use the words of G. K. Chesterton), and it strikes you‚Äîyou see this one thing differently and once you do, it changes things. You can no longer 'go back and see it the way you did before.'\\" DƒÖbrowski called this vertical dimension multilevelness. Multilevelness is a gradual realization of the \\"possibility of the higher\\" (a phrase DƒÖbrowski used frequently) and of the subsequent contrasts between the higher and the lower in life. These vertical comparisons often illustrate the lower, actual behavior of a person in contrast to higher, imagined ideals and alternative idealized choices. DƒÖbrowski believed that the authentic individual would choose the higher path as the clear and obvious one to follow (erasing the ambivalences and ambitendencies of unilevel conflicts). If the person's actual behavior subsequently falls short of the ideal, internal disharmony and a drive to review and reconstruct one's life often follow. Multilevelness thus represents a new and powerful type of conflict, a conflict that is developmental in DƒÖbrowski's approach. Vertical conflicts are critical in leading to autonomy and advanced personality growth. If the person is to achieve higher levels, the shift to multilevelness must occur. If a person does not have the developmental potential to move into a multilevel view, then he or she will fall back from the crises of Level II to reintegrate at Level I. In the shift to multilevelness, the horizontal (unilevel), stimulus-response model of life is replaced by a vertical and hierarchical analysis. This vertical view becomes anchored by one's emerging individual value structure, and all events are seen in relation to personal ideals. These personal value ideals become the personality ideal: how the person wants to live his or her life. As events in life are seen in relation to this multilevel, vertical view, it becomes impossible to support positions that favor the lower course when higher goals can be identified (or imagined). =Level IV: Directed multilevel disintegration= In Level IV the person takes full control of their development. The involuntary spontaneous development of Level III is replaced by a deliberate, conscious and self- directed review of life from the multilevel perspective. This level marks the real emergence of the third factor, described by DƒÖbrowski as an autonomous factor \\"of conscious choice (valuation) by which one affirms or rejects certain qualities in oneself and in one's environment\\". The person consciously reviews his or her existing belief system and tries to replace lower, automatic views and reactions with carefully thought out, examined and chosen ideals. These new values will increasingly be reflected in the person's behavior. Behavior becomes less reactive, less automatic and more deliberate as behavioral choices fall under the influence of the person's higher, chosen ideals. Social mores are reviewed and re-accepted by a conscious internalization when the individual feels it is appropriate. Likewise, when the person feels it is proper, a social value is reviewed and may be rejected to be replaced by a self-perceived higher alternative value. One's social orientation comes to reflect a deep responsibility based on both intellectual and emotional factors. At the highest levels, \\"individuals of this kind feel responsible for the realization of justice and for the protection of others against harm and injustice. Their feelings of responsibility extend almost to everything.\\" This perspective results from seeing life in relation to one's hierarchy of values (the multilevel view) and the subsequent appreciation of the potential of how life could be, and ought to be, lived. One's disagreements with the (lower level) world are expressed compassionately in doing what one can to help achieve the \\"ought\\". Given their genuine (authentic) prosocial outlook, people achieving higher development also raise the level of their society. Prosocial here is not just support of the existing social order. If the social order is lower and you are adjusted to it, then you also reflect the lower (negative adjustment in DƒÖbrowski's terms, a Level I feature). Here, prosocial is a genuine cultivation of social interactions based on higher values. These positions often conflict with the status quo of a lower society (positive maladjustment). In other words, to be maladjusted to a low-level society is a positive feature. =Level V: Secondary integration= The fifth level displays an integrated and harmonious character, but one vastly different from that at the first level. At this highest level, one's behavior is guided by conscious, carefully weighed decisions based on an individualized and chosen hierarchy of personal values. Behavior conforms to this inner standard of how life ought to be lived, and thus little inner conflict arises. Level V is often marked by creative expression. Especially at Level V, problem solving and art represent the highest and noblest features of human life. Art captures the innermost emotional states and is based on a deep empathy and understanding of the subject. Often, human suffering and sacrifice are the subjects of these works. Truly visionary works, works that are unique and novel, are created by people expressing a vision unrestrained by convention. Advances in society, through politics, philosophy and religion, are therefore commonly associated with strong individual creativity or accomplishments. Applications =Therapy= The theory of positive disintegration has an extremely broad scope and has implications for many areas. One central application applies to psychological and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. DƒÖbrowski advocated a comprehensive, multidimensional diagnosis of the person's situation, including symptoms and developmental potentials. Symptoms and developmental potential If the disintegration appears to fit into a developmental context, then the person is educated in the theory and encouraged to take a developmental view of his or her situation and experiences. Rather than being eliminated, symptoms are reframed to yield insight and understanding into life and the person's unique situation. The importance of narratives DƒÖbrowski illustrated his theory through autobiographies of and biographies about those who have experienced positive disintegration. The gifted child, the suicidal teen or the troubled artist is often experiencing the features of TPD, and if they accept and understand the meaning of their intense feelings and crises, they can move ahead, not fall apart. The completion of an extensive autobiography to help the individual gain perspective on his or her past and present is an important component in the autopsychotherapy process. In this process, the therapist plays a very small role and acts more as an initial stimulus than an ongoing therapist. DƒÖbrowski asked clients to read his books and to see how his ideas might relate to their lives. Autopsychotherapy For DƒÖbrowski, the goal of therapy is to eliminate the therapist by providing a context within which a person can understand and help oneself, an approach to therapy that he called autopsychotherapy. The client is encouraged to embark on a journey of self-discovery with an emphasis on looking for the contrast between what is higher versus what is lower within his or her personality and value structure. The person is encouraged to further explore his or her value structure especially as it relates to the rationale and justification of positions. Discrepancies between values and behavior are highlighted. The approach is called autopsychotherapy to emphasize the important role that the individual must play in his or her own therapy process and in the larger process of personality development. The individual must come to see that he or she is in charge of determining or creating his or her own unique personality ideal and value structure. This includes a critical review of social mores and values that have been learned. DƒÖbrowski was very concerned about what he called one-sided development, in which people display significant advanced development in only one aspect of life, usually intellectual. He believed that it is crucial to balance one's development. Overexcitability DƒÖbrowski also encouraged people to see their reactions (overexcitabilities) and their phenomenological view of the world in the context of their developmental potential. The experience of, and reaction to, crises are a very important aspect of this approach and people are encouraged to experience personal crises with a positive and developmental view. DƒÖbrowski reminds clients that without internal disease there is little stimulus for change or growth. Rather than trying to rapidly ameliorate symptoms, this approach encourages individuals to fully experience their feelings and to try to maintain a positive and developmental orientation to what they may perceive as strong depression or anxiety. Of course, this is a unique approach in today's world of seeking immediate and total relief of any unpleasant psychological experience (although it can be compared to Aron's to some extent). =Education= Another primary focus is on education, in particular, over the past 25 years, on the experience of creative and gifted students. DƒÖbrowski hypothesized that these students will disproportionately show strong overexcitability and therefore will be prone to the disintegrative process. DƒÖbrowski and the gifted individual In an appendix to DƒÖbrowski (1967), results of investigations done in 1962 with Polish youth are reported. Specifically, \\"a group of gifted children and young people aged 8 to 23\\" were examined (p. 251). Of the 80 youth studied, 30 were \\"intellectually gifted\\" and 50 were from \\"drama, ballet, and plastic art schools\\" (p. 251). DƒÖbrowski found that every one of the children displayed overexcitability, \\"which constituted the foundation for the emergence of neurotic and psychoneurotic sets. Moreover it turned out that these children also showed sets of nervousness, neurosis, and psychoneurosis of various kinds and intensities, from light vegetative symptoms, or anxiety symptoms, to distinctly and highly intensive psychasthenic or hysterical sets\\" (p. 253). DƒÖbrowski asked why these children should display such \\"states of nervousness or psychoneurosis\\" and suggested that it was due to the presence of OE (p. 255). \\"Probably the cause is more than average sensitivity which not only permits one to achieve outstanding results in learning and work, but at the same time increases the number of points sensitive to all experiences that may accelerate anomalous reactions revealing themselves in psychoneurotic sets\\" (p. 255). The association between OE and giftedness appears to be borne out in the research (Lysy and Piechowski 1983; Piechowski 1986; Piechowski and Miller 1995). It appears that at the least OE is a marker of potential for giftedness/creativity. DƒÖbrowski's basic message is that the gifted will disproportionately display this process of positive disintegration and personality growth. Key ideas The theory is based on key ideas that may be listed as follows: *That our lower animal instincts (first factor) must be inhibited and transformed into \\"higher\\" forces for us to be Human (this ability to transform our instincts is what separates us from other animals). *That the common initial personality integration, based upon socialization (second factor), does not reflect true personality. *At the initial level of integration, there is little internal conflict as when one \\"goes along with the group\\", there is little sense of individual wrongdoing. External conflicts often relate to the blockage of social goals‚Äîcareer frustrations for example. The social mores and values prevail with little question or conscious examination. *True personality must be based upon a system of values that are consciously and volitionally chosen by the person to reflect their own individual sense of \\"how life ought to be\\" and their \\"personality ideal\\"‚Äîthe ideal person they feel they \\"ought to be\\". *The lower animal instincts and the forces of peer groups and socialization are inferior to the autonomous self (personality) constructed by the conscious person. *To break down the initial integration, crises and disintegrations are needed, usually provided by life experience. *These disintegrations are positive if the person can achieve positive and developmental solutions to the situation. *\\"Unilevel crises\\" are not developmental as the person can only choose between equal alternatives (go left or go right?). *A new type of perception involves \\"multilevelness\\", a vertical view of life that compares lower versus higher alternatives and now allows the individual to choose a higher resolution to a crisis over other available, but lower, alternatives‚Äîthe developmental solution. *\\"Positive disintegration\\" is a vital developmental process. *DƒÖbrowski developed the idea of \\"developmental potential\\" to describe the forces needed to achieve autonomous personality development. *Developmental potential includes several factors including innate abilities and talents, \\"overexcitability\\" and the \\"third factor\\". *Overexcitability is a measure of an individual's level of nervous response. DƒÖbrowski found that the exemplars he studied all displayed an overly sensitive nervous system, also making them prone to angst, depression and anxiety‚Äîpsychoneuroses in DƒÖbrowski's terms, a very positive and developmental feature. *The third factor is a measure of an individual's drive toward autonomy. *DƒÖbrowski's approach is very interesting philosophically as it is Platonic, reflecting the bias of Plato toward essence‚Äîan individual's essence is a critical determinant of his or her developmental course in life. However, DƒÖbrowski also added a major existential aspect as well, what one depends upon the anxieties felt and on how one resolves the day to day challenges one faces. Essence must be realized through an existential and experiential process of development. The characterization advanced by Kierkegaard of \\"Knights of faith\\" may be compared to DƒÖbrowski's autonomous individual. *Reviewed the role of logic and reasoning in development and concludes that intellect alone does not fully help us know what to do in life. Incorporates Jean Piaget's views of development into a broader scheme guided by emotion. Emotion (how one feels about something) is the more accurate guide to life's major decisions. *When multilevel and autonomous development is achieved, a secondary integration is seen reflecting the mature personality state. The individual has no inner conflict; they are in internal harmony as their actions reflect their deeply felt hierarchy of values. *Rejected Abraham Maslow's description of self- actualization (DƒÖbrowski was a personal friend and correspondent of Maslow's). Actualization of an undifferentiated human self is not a developmental outcome in DƒÖbrowski's terms. DƒÖbrowski applied a multilevel (vertical) approach to self and saw the need to become aware of and to inhibit and reject the lower instinctual aspects of the intrinsic human self (aspects that Maslow would have us \\"embrace without guilt\\") and to actively choose and assemble higher elements into a new unique self. DƒÖbrowski would have us differentiate the initial self into higher and lower aspects, as we define them, and to reject the lower and actualize the higher in creating our unique personality. Secondary integration versus self-actualization People have often equated Maslow's concept of self-actualization with DƒÖbrowski's level of secondary integration. There are some major differences between these two ideas. Fundamentally, Maslow described self-actualization as a process where the self is accepted \\"as is\\", so both higher and lower aspects of the self are actualized. DƒÖbrowski introduces the notion that although the lower aspects may initially be intrinsic to the self, as human beings we are able to become aware of their lower nature. We are able to develop self-awareness into how we feel about these low levels‚Äîif we feel badly about behaving in these lower ways, then we are able to cognitively and volitionally decide to inhibit and eliminate these behaviors. In this way, the higher aspects of the self are actualized while the lower aspects are inhibited and, for DƒÖbrowski, this is what is unique about humans and sets us apart from other animals ‚Äî no other animal is able to differentiate their lower instincts and therefore can not inhibit their animalistic impulses, an idea also expressed in Plessner's eccentricity. DƒÖbrowski has gone beyond Maslow's idea of self-actualization and it is not appropriate to equate the two authors on this point. Obstacles to the theory Both DƒÖbrowski and his work have faced many obstacles. Personally, he was severely affected by both World Wars. His work went against the grain as a humanistic theory promoting personal growth in the political atmosphere of Poland in the 1950s and 1960s. Another problem has been language. DƒÖbrowski wrote in Polish and translated his works into French and Spanish. English was the last language he learned and likely the most difficult in terms of capturing the subtleties of his ideas. In spite of these problems, DƒÖbrowski persevered with his studies of human development, developed his theory and practiced psychiatry all his life. DƒÖbrowski died in 1980 and his students went on to explore careers of their own. Many of these students continue to study and speak on the theory, most advancing a deeply personal understanding of what the theory means to them. Since 1980, there has been a small but consistent demand for DƒÖbrowski's works. This demand has largely evolved in the United States where Michael Piechowski applied his vision of the theory to gifted education. Many in education and in gifted education have looked to DƒÖbrowski's theory to help provide a context for their students. Although a small part of the overall theory, this aspect has generated a number of Master's and Ph.D. theses and introduced the theory to a large audience. The reader interested in DƒÖbrowski has faced a serious scarcity of resources, especially of DƒÖbrowski's English works. His books are long out of print and rare, and his papers are held by a few people but not circulated. There are also many Polish works by DƒÖbrowski (about 20 books) on the theory, on psychotherapy, on education and on philosophy that have not been translated into English. One severe hurdle to the investigation and study of the theory of positive disintegration is the fact that no suitable psychological test exists that measures any DƒÖbrowskian constructs well. The most widely known instrument, the Overexcitability Questionnaire‚ÄîTwo, has poor psychometric properties.

The lake is about long when at full capacity. The lake was created in 1966 with the completion of Lower Hell Hole DamBrass plaque installed at dam breakwater: \\"Placer County Water Agency; Middle Fork American River Development; Hell Hole Reservoir and Dam -1966. Acre feet - 207,590. Height . Area .\\" across the Rubicon River, which is a major tributary of the Middle Fork of the American River. Hell Hole is named for a deep canyon which is now under the waters of the lake. How the canyon came to be named Hell Hole is a combination of folklore and speculation. An early author, George Wharton James (1858‚Äì1923), visited the canyon in 1913.James, George Wharton The Lake of the Sky, J.F. Tapley Co, New York,1915 Ch.15-16 He attributed the name to an unidentified miner seeking riches during the Squaw Valley mining excitement of 1862. It was \\"a hell of hole to get out of,\\" James wrote, but admitted his source for the place name was more speculative than the anonymous miner's chances for riches at Squaw Valley. James' guide for the 1913 camping expedition to Hell Hole was Bob Watson, a well-known camping guide who operated in the Lake Tahoe Region from the 1880s into the first decades of the 20th century. Watson may have been the source of the story who sought to entertain and edify his paying clients with tales of local history. James attributed much of the local lore to Watson. The United States Board on Geographic Names attributes the first use of the name \\"Hell Hole\\" to a United States Geological Survey map of 1894. The board was created in 1890, so previous uses of the name on federal government maps are possible. James reported finding a natural lake near the Hell Hole chasm known as Bear Lake, which would have been drowned by the reservoir. He also described Hell Hole in terms that belies the colorful name: \\"Hell Hole? Then give me more of it,\\" he wrote. The author reported his pleasure of the canyon was derived from its rugged nature that precluded human exploitation: Logging, mining, water development and road building, evident in other portions of the Lake Tahoe region. It was \\"a paradise of delightful surprises,\\" he wrote. Current conditions Lower Hell Hole Dam (its official name) is operated by the Placer County Water Agency. The agency controls two dams in the Eldorado National Forest and Tahoe National Forest. The water agency gained its power from financing approved by Placer County voters in 1961. Proposals for the dam date to 1958. In 1964 the first Hell Hole dam was partially complete.Fisher-Smith, Jordan Nature noir : a park ranger's patrol in the Sierra Houghton Mifflin, Boston Mass., 2005. The dam collapsed on December 23, 1964. A new dam was completed in 1966. Placer County sought drinking water supplies to fuel growth of its communities in the Sacramento Valley. The gold-rush-era town of Auburn is in Placer County as is the suburban community of Roseville. The agency also sought to generate hydroelectric power to finance its ability to deliver the water to users. =Recreational uses= Today, the lake offers modern facilities to aid in waterborne recreation. The remoteness of the lake limits the number of visitors, so the lake is seldom crowded even during the height of the summer season. Most boating activity is limited to small powered fishing skiffs, canoes and kayaks. Afternoon high winds can make boating precarious. Upper Hell Hole campground's mid-level campsite nestled between two streams The lake is known by its three components: Lower Hell Hole, the Narrows and Upper Hell Hole. The lake is accessible by motor vehicle only at Lower Hell Hole, where a paved launch facility and forest service ranger station are located. The Hell Hole campground is also located there. The campground features a view of the polished granite lakeshore but is not located directly on the shore of the lake because of the steep grade. The campground features a parking area but the 10 campsites are walk-in only. Many visitors use Big Meadows campground about one mile (1.6 km) away, which has 54 drive-in campsites suitable for recreational vehicles. A second forest service campground is maintained at Upper Hell Hole and is known by that name. It can be reached by boat or a hiking trail that is reached by crossing the breakwater of the dam and hiking on a trail that flanks the lake but is several hundred feet above the water. Upper Hell Hole campground is said to have 15 campsites and two pit toilets, but does not have trash service or other amenities. A camping fee is not charged. The campground is arranged on three tiers of elevation. Steps are cut into the granite rock to connect the levels. During the spring and early summer snowmelt, several of the campsites feature creeks and waterfalls nearby. Other campsites there are sheltered by giant granite boulders. Camping is also permitted wherever the rugged shoreline will permit boat landing. Driftwood-filled Five Lakes Creek as it joins the reservoir The lake's principal inflows are from the Rubicon River and Five Lakes Creek, formerly a tributary of the Rubicon. Lake water has drowned the historical confluence of the two water courses. The Rubicon River was once known as the south fork of the middle fork of the American River. The Rubicon River's entry into the lake is via a cataract where the river has eroded through the elevated granite block. The lake also features many small granitic islands that expand and contract with the level of the lake. Hell Hole typically has its highest level of water in May and lowers gradually through the summer and fall. The forest service maintains visitor services from May 15 through September 15. The lake is accessible until snow makes roads to the area impassable. In 1984, the federally protected Granite Chief Wilderness was created by the United States Congress after a long advocacy campaign by the Sierra Club, a conservation organization. Upper Hell Hole forms the western border of the Granite Chief Wilderness. A small buffer zone between the lake shore and the wilderness prevents accidental intrusion into the wilderness. The juxtaposition of the lake and wilderness presents the opportunity for rustic boat/backpacking adventures through the rugged and scenic of wilderness. Like the lake itself, the wilderness is lightly used on the western border. Hell Hole Trail enters the wilderness from near the lake but is difficult to locate. Granite Chief Wilderness is managed by the Tahoe National Forest, while visitor facilities at Hell Hole are exclusively managed by El Dorado National Forest (Georgetown district). The Truckee and American River (formerly Foresthill) ranger districts of the Tahoe National Forest advise caution at Granite Chief: \\"Topographic maps and skills to use them are highly recommended in the wilderness because of the minimal level in signing and remoteness of the area.\\" Wilderness permits are not required to enter the Granite Chief Wilderness. Campfire permits are always required.U.S. Forest Service, Tahoe National Forest, Truckee and Foresthill Ranger Districts, Granite Chief Wilderness information packet. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Hell Hole Reservoir based on levels of mercury found in species of fish caught there. Hydrology The construction of the present Hell Hole Dam also changed the course of the Rubicon River. Lowest cataract on Rubicon River before it enters the reservoir The pre-dam river channel wended its way several miles to its confluence with the Middle Fork of the American River near Ralston Afterbay. Now, In addition to releases from Hell Hole down the pre-dam path, water is diverted through a pipeline to Middle Fork Powerhouse (AKA Stephenson Powerhouse) where it flows into Interbay Reservoir. From here, in addition to releases down the Middle Fork American River, the water is diverted into a tunnel to Ralston Powerhouse and into Ralston Afterbay, where it joins water from the pre-dam path. Oxbow Powerhouse and Oxbow control dam there releases water into the middle fork of the American River just below the spot of the historical confluence. Water for hydroelectric generation is also shuttled into Hell Hole from French Meadows Reservoir which impounds the Middle Fork of the American River. The water travels through a tunnel to a powerhouse located on the north side of Hell Hole. French Meadows, at 5,200 elevation, is higher than the elevation at Hell Hole. The powerhouse at Hell Hole is actually known by the name, French Meadows powerhouse.Placer County Water Agency, Map 1, Archaeological Survey, 2006, 2007 The traditional channel of the Rubicon River still maintains water flow from the spillway at Hell Hole Dam and from tributaries of the Rubicon below the dam, such as Gerle Creek (pronounced girly). The Placer County Water Agency does not take water directly from Hell Hole or the other dam but instead claims rights to the water as it is shipped through the American River System and ends up at Folsom Lake near Sacramento. Folsom dam was originally constructed for the purposes of flood control. The Placer water agency's dams and Ralston are presently known as the Middle Fork Project. Historical usage Hell Hole canyon and nearby vicinities initially escaped man-made exploitation during the latter half of the 19th century, but events that occurred then allowed eventual exploitation of Hell Hole during the 1960s. Rubicon river and upper cataract The gold rush of 1849 on the South Fork of the American River resulted in establishment of Sierra foothill towns of Auburn, Placerville, Nevada City and Georgetown. The gold rush did not intrude into the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada range, but the water and timber needs of these towns did intrude into the upper elevations. In one case in 1873 the privately owned, California Water CompanySources differ on who dammed Loon Lake. Mike Brattland of Gerle Creek.com cites the California Water Company, while George Wharton James (cited above) wrote the dam was in the hands of the Reno Water and Electric Power Company the two citations are 40 years apart and both could be correct. employed a scheme to dam Loon Lake to the south of Hell Hole and then sluice the water closer to Georgetown where it could be used by residents and farmers. Somewhat later, in 1862, the residents of Placer County (Auburn, Foresthill) came upon a scheme to build a road from the Foresthill divide to Squaw Valley with the intent of luring immigrant trains away from Nevada City and into Placerville and neighboring vicinities. George Wharton James, the author, described the road as an ill- fated enterprise: \\"The grade is frightful. For an hour or more, we go slowly up it stopping every few yards or so to give our horses breath,\\" James wrote of a ride on the old road a half century after it was built. \\"It is hard enough for horses to go up this grade but to pull heavily-ladened (sic) wagons - it seems impossible, \\" he concluded. Later attempts to improve this road or forge other wagon roads were not successful. The Comstock Lode silver rush in the 1860s in Nevada Territory also encouraged the attempt of the gold-rush foothillers to find pathways over the mountains to the riches of the Comstock and the more local Squaw Valley silver excitement. The roads then brought timber claimants and homesteaders, called locators, who were able to claim public lands. The old homesteads and timber claims were bought by private water companies or hoteliers who sought visitors to the \\"healthful\\" mineral springs after much of the timber was depleted by the mid-1880s. Railroads brought the tourists. Tourists could reach Truckee, California by rail from either San Francisco or Ogden, Utah by the end of the 19th century. The Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company brought them to the lake. One particular resort established east of Hell Hole has a significant relationship to the canyon. Deer Park, just south of Squaw Valley (now a ski area and home to the 1960 Winter Olympics) was a tourist hotel which had a rustic hideaway camp at Five Lakes now in Granite Chief Wilderness. James described the Five Lakes resort as a timber claim in which the timber had never been cut but in which cabins had been built and rowboats kept in hand for fishing upon the five small lakes. The Five Lakes are the headwaters of Five Lakes Creek which led James on his 1913 horseback descent into Hell Hole in the company of Bob Watson, the guide. The pair camped at Hell Hole, then ascended the Rubicon River to Rockbound Lake, where they camped again. Rockbound Lake is now in the Desolation Wilderness and is near the headwaters of the Rubicon River. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District controls a dam within the Desolation Wilderness: Rubicon Reservoir. Desolation Wilderness was created in 1969. Recent history Upper Hell Hole looking northwest to Granite Chief Wilderness, May 2005 Placer County's 1961 bond approval allowed its water agency to seek out water supplies that were not already claimed by others. Loon Lake, south of Hell Hole, was already prescripted, but the rugged, untouched Hell Hole was not. In 1934, the State of California took steps to claim any unclaimed water rights along the American River's three forks. In 1962 the rights to the Rubicon River water were conveyed to Placer County. The Hell Hole dam, a rock-fill-type dam, was completed across the Rubicon River in December 1964. As the reservoir began filling the dam sprung a leak during a flood event and failed completely the next day. The resulting flood washed down the Middle Fork of the American River and washed away the Greenwood Bridge near Auburn. The Placer County Water Agency began a new dam which was completed two years later and has now stood for 42 years.[The author, User:Vabulf] worked for McCreary-Koretsky Engrs on the MFAR Project-between June 1964 and December of 1965 and before that worked for Ets-Hokins & Galvin on the Brushy Springs(Middle Fork) Powerhouse & Penstock. Hell Hole Dam was partially completed at the time of extremely heavy storms in December 1964. The downstream rockfill portion was up ~220' above the river bottom, but the impervious core and adjacent zones were only up ~35'. Debris from extreme storm runoff upstream of the dam blocked the diversion outlet, and water rapidly accumulated behind the partially constructed dam. As the water came up it was seeping through the rockfill, and when it crested, the entire mass collapsed in a matter of minutes. A surge went down the canyon, washing out two older suspension bridges below the Long Canyon influx and at the Spanish Dry Diggings crossing near Greenwood. It then washed out the State Highway 49 bridge over the American River just below Auburn. Folsom Dam reservoir absorbed the surge below that point.

At present most work focuses on the neural correlates of particular types of conscious content, aiming to distinguish between conscious and unconscious representations in the human brain. As a considerable amount is already known about the anatomy and physiology of the visual system, much of the research in the laboratory focuses on visual awareness. However, his laboratory also studies the auditory and somatosensory systems. Most research involves functional MRI at high field, in combination with behavioral studies, transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG/MEG. Previous work by Rees has suggested that subjective awareness of objects in the visual environment is associated not just with enhanced activation in visual areas of the occipital lobe, but also areas of parietal and prefrontal cortex often associated with attention. A major focus of this work is therefore in studying interactions between visual cortex and these areas, both in the context of attention, and with respect to eye movements. More recently, he has worked on neurodegeneration, collaborating with Sarah Tabrizi. His work on multivariate inference has led to collaborations with Parashkev Nachev and work in high- dimensional neurology and with DeepMind. He co-edited a large reference book entitled the Neurobiology of Attention with Laurent Itti and John Tsotsos, and is the author of numerous articles and invited reviews on the functional imaging of consciousness.

The school was named Central Dauphin High School, for the school district. Central Dauphin School District was created in 1957, and this merger of several school districts was completed by the opening of Central Dauphin High School. Between 1955 and 1972, renovations and additions were added to the school, including the science wing, a planetarium, and a new cafeteria. In 2003, the planetarium was named for the school's highly inspirational and influential teacher Dennis Phillippy, however was demolished in 2007. In the late 1990s, overcrowding in the Central Dauphin School District resulted in a proposal to merge Central Dauphin High School with nearby rival Central Dauphin East High School. The proposal was opposed by Central Dauphin High School and was later voted down by the school board (after its removal in the election the week before). In 2000, the school board voted to build a third high school, but in a sudden turnaround by the school board, it was decided that the district would have only two high schools. A new facility was to be built, and it would be named Central Dauphin High School. In the 2004-05 school year, the high school moved from its Locust Lane, Lower Paxton Township location to its current Piketown Road, West Hanover Township location. The old building was renovated, and it is now being used as Central Dauphin Middle School. In 2004, former President George W. Bush visited the school, making a speech in the auditorium. Since 1955, the yearbook has been called the Centralian. The school newspaper is called the Rampage. Central Dauphin High School is one of the largest public high schools in south-central Pennsylvania and holds graduation ceremonies at the Giant Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. ;11th Grade Reading: *2012 - 76% on grade level, (9% below basic).

The 8N, which debuted in July 1947, was a largely new machine featuring more power and an improved transmission. By some measures the 8N became the most popular farm tractor of all time in North America. Over 530,000 units of 8N were sold worldwide; the Fordson Model F had sold over 650,000 units worldwide, but in North American sales the 8N surpassed it in popular acclaim and units sold. Development of the Ford-Ferguson tractors Harry Ferguson's tractor hitch development status as of 1922. The hitch is shown as an aftermarket attachment mounted on a Fordson tractor. It is a fully mechanical version with a depth wheel (small wheel that sets the plow depth). Ford-Ferguson Model 9N The first genuine Ford tractor was called the Fordson because a misleading Ford brand not related to Henry Ford was squatting on the Ford name at the time (Ford Tractor Company). The Fordson was a tremendous success in North America and Europe from 1917 to 1928. Ford of the U.S. left the tractor business in 1928. Ford Ltd of Britain continued to thrive with the Fordson from 1928 onward. Some British Fordsons were imported to the U.S. during the following decade. Henry Ford continued tractor R&D; in the U.S. after 1928. During the 1930s, experiments were made at Ford's Dearborn, Michigan and Richmond Plantation, Georgia facilities, creating prototypes of row-crop tricycle Fordsons, V8-powered tractors, one-wheel-drive tractors, and other ideas. But Henry Ford waited to reenter the market, planning to have the right new tractor at the right time to achieve a market- changing success. In Ireland, businessman Harry Ferguson had been developing and selling various improved hitches, implements, and tractors since the 1910s. His first tractors were adapted from Model T cars. In 1920 and 1921 he gave demonstrations at Cork and Dearborn of his hitches and implements as aftermarket attachments to Fordson tractors. The hitches were mechanical at the time. By 1926, he and a team of longtime colleagues (including Willie Sands and Archie Greer) had developed a good hydraulic three-point hitch. Ferguson put such hitches on Fordsons throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. In the mid-1930s, he had David Brown Ltd build Ferguson-brand tractors with his hitches and implements. In 1938, Eber Sherman, importer of Fordsons from England to the United States and a friend of both Ford and Ferguson, arranged to have Ferguson demonstrate his tractor for Henry Ford. In October 1938 the Ferguson tractor was put through a demonstration before Ford and his engineers. It was light in weight relative to its power, which impressed Ford. Ferguson's successful tractor demonstration led to a handshake agreement with Ford in 1938, whereby Ford would manufacture tractors using the Ferguson three-point hitch system. Ford Motor Company invested $12 million in tooling to finance Ferguson's new distribution company. The investment resulted in the production of the 9N tractor which was introduced on June 29, 1939. It was officially called a \\"Ford tractor with the Ferguson system\\", although the name Ford-Ferguson was widely used. It sold for $585 including rubber tires, power take-off, Ferguson hydraulics, an electric starter, generator, and battery; lights were optional. Ford's 9N further improved the cantankerous Model F by updating the ignition with a distributor and coil. An innovative system of tire mounts for the rear wheels and versatile axle mounts for the fronts enabled farmers to accommodate any width row-crop work they needed. The 9N weighed 2340 pounds and had 13 drawbar horsepower, which could pull a two- bottom plow. It was designed to be safe, quiet and easy to operate. Ford once said \\"Our competition is the horse.\\"; the 9N was intended for farmers who were not mechanically minded. An immediate success, the 9N's configuration became an industry standard, which was followed by other tractor manufacturers for fifteen years. Henry Ford passed leadership of his company to grandson Henry Ford II in 1945. By 1946, the younger Ford discovered that, despite its success, the Model N lost Ford Motor Company over $25 million in six years. He reacted by forming Dearborn Motors in November 1946, which took over tractor distribution from Ferguson. Ford informed Ferguson that after July 1947 they would no longer supply tractors to his company. Ferguson sued Henry Ford II, Dearborn Motors and Ford Motor Company and others for $251 million in damages on the basis of patent infringements and conspiracy to monopolize the farm tractor business. Ford Motor Company claimed the patents had already expired by the time of Dearborn Motors' incorporation. Approximately 750,000 9Ns were built, and it was estimated in 2001 that nearly half of these were still in regular use. Harry Ferguson had understood that the handshake agreement had included the manufacture of the 9N in Britain. World War II intervened and prevented this, although one explanation was that Ford UK was uninterested in the plan. N-series models =9N= A Ford 9NThe first tractor of the series was the 9N, the first tractor to have both three-point hitch and a rear power take-off (PTO). The 9N was first demonstrated in Dearborn, Michigan on June 29, 1939. Its model name reflected a model-naming system using the last digit of the year of introduction and a letter for product type, with \\"N\\" for tractors (hence 9N). Like the Farmall, it was designed to be a general-purpose row-crop tractor for use on smaller farms. An extremely simple tractor, the 9N was fitted with the Ferguson system three-point hitch, a three-speed transmission, and featured footpegs instead of running boards. The 9N's relatively tall and wide-spaced front wheel design resulted in somewhat sluggish steering and reduced maneuverability compared to competing machines such as John Deere's Models A and B, and the Farmall \\"Letter series\\". The 9N had variable front track, a valuable feature for row-crop cultivation, via front half-axles that could be slid in and out and pinned in place. It also had variable rear track via the reversible offset of the rear wheel design (flipping the rear wheels around 180¬∞, moving the formerly inboard side to the outboard side, widened the rear track). Uniquely, the exhaust was routed underneath the tractor, much like an automobile. All 9N tractors were painted dark grey. This tractor has a rear PTO, which could be used to drive three- point or towed implements. The Ferguson hitch was designed to solve some of the problems found in the earlier Fordson tractors, such as flipping over if the plow hit an obstruction. The upper link also would adjust the hydraulic lift to use the drag of the plow to improve traction. This was known as draft control. The original 9N engine was a four-cylinder engine and was designed to be powered by distillate fuels. The engine shares the same bore and stroke sizes as one bank of the Ford V8 automobile engines. A few standard Ford auto and truck parts, such as timing gears and valve tappets, were used in this engine. The ford 9N engine was a side-valve, four-cylinder engine, with a bore, stroke, providing a displacement of . The transmission was the standard three-speed. The finished tractor weighed , and initially sold for US$585. This was an advantage, as tractors from other manufacturers cost almost twice as much.Ford Tractors by Robert N. Pripps 2007 =2N= The 9N was revised a number of times, until being relaunched as the 2N in 1942. The 2N still came in dark grey, but now had added improvements, including a larger cooling fan and a pressurized radiator. However, the 2N, like the 9N, still had only a 3-speed transmission, a disadvantage compared to many tractors at the time, such as the Farmall A and M. By this time, wartime regulations had imposed manufacturing economies, and some 2Ns can be seen with all-steel wheels. Batteries were reserved for the war effort, so the all-steel wheel tractors came with a magneto ignition system instead of a battery and had to be started with a hand-crank. Introducing a new model name also allowed Ford to raise the price of the tractor. Wartime price controls prevented the raising of prices on existing models, but they could not determine the price of a \\"new\\" model. Despite the model name change, the serial numbers continued to be prefixed with \\"9N\\". After the war the steel wheels and magneto system were replaced with rubber tires and batteries, respectively. =Ferguson and Ford part ways= In 1945 due to Henry Ford's failing health, Henry Ford II, his grandson, took over the Ford Motor Company. Since the original agreement between Ford and Ferguson was sealed with a handshake (versus a written contract) and included the notion that either party could terminate it at any time without reason, Henry Ford II didn't feel the need to continue to honor it. Ferguson was furious and sued Ford Motor Company. A few years later his Ferguson interests were merged with Massey Harris, a Canadian company, to become Massey Ferguson. =8N= A restored Ford 8N Official production of the 8N tractor began in July 1947. Equipped with a 4-speed transmission, this model was destined to become the top-selling individual tractor of all time in North America. The most noticeable differences between the 8N and its predecessors was the inclusion of a 4-speed transmission instead of a 3-speed in the 9N and 2N, and an increase in both PTO and drawbar horsepower. The other big change on the 8N was the addition of a 'Position-control' setting for the hydraulics. This change was made partially to improve flexibility in varying soil conditions, and partially to evade Harry Ferguson's patent on the hydraulic system. The original automatic draft control on the Ferguson system would allow the depth of the implement to vary based on soil conditions, which did not work well for some implements. The new Position Control setting bypassed the draft control and allowed the implement to remain at a consistent position relative to the position of the Touch Control lever. A continued drawback to this series of tractor, was the lack of a \\"live\\" PTO. Without a live PTO certain implements such as brush cutters which store inertial energy could send that back into the transmission. This would cause the tractor to surge forward if the clutch were disengaged. This was addressed with the advent of the PTO overrunning coupler. The 8N was equipped with running boards and was painted lighter gray on the sheetmetal and red on the body. It was the first Ford tractor to feature a clutch on the left side and independent brakes on the right. The wide-spaced front wheel design of the 9N and 2N was retained. In 1950 the 8N design changed to feature a side-mounted distributor, as well a Proofmeter (combined speedometer, tachometer, hour meter) located on the lower right portion of the dash. Replacement In 1953 The N-series tractor was replaced with the all-new model dubbed the Golden Jubilee, also known as the Ford NAA. The NAA designation was a reference to the first three digits of the serial style used starting with this tractor. Larger than the 8N, the Golden Jubilee featured live hydraulics and an all-new overhead valve engine. The new tractor was four inches longer, four inches higher and 100 pounds heavier at 2,840 pounds than the N series. The following 600 series and later numbered model tractors were derived from the NAA. The 'N' in the serial number sometimes causes confusion that the Golden Jubilee tractor was a continuation of the N series. New Holland tribute tractor Beginning in 2009, New Holland produced a retro-styled tractor designed to resemble the Ford 8N. The tractor was based on the Boomer 3050-series tractor. The tractor featured a hood styled after the 8N and a gray and red paint scheme similar to the 8N. The tractor was produced for three years through 2011. The tractor had no parts in common with the original Ford 8N. File:Boomer8N NA.jpgNew Holland Boomer 8N File:New Holland Boomer 3040 - Flickr - Joost J.

In some federal states the term is used as a special legal status for a district-affiliated town‚Äîas distinct from an independent city‚Äîwith additional competences in comparison with other municipalities of the district. The title is based on sovereign conferment by the state government. Administration rules The term is officially used and quoted. In different German federal states (Bundesl√§nder) there are different laws and administration rules about when exactly a town can obtain this status but they do not differ very much. The mayor of a Gro√üe Kreisstadt usually bears the title of an Oberb√ºrgermeister (\\"Chief Burgomaster\\"). At the moment reforms are being discussed in some states. It is not a main goal of these reforms to make the rules more similar; on the contrary, the district towns are thought to be important in order to preserve the existing regional diversity. In Germany federal states have very similar administration rules, so they are not always comparable to U.S. states for example.  Gro√üe Kreisst√§dte in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria and Saxony  District-affiliated municipalities may apply for the status of a Gro√üe Kreisstadt, conferred by decree of the state's interior ministry. Assuming certain sovereign functions of the district, the municipal authorities have to ensure they are able to carry out the assigned responsibilities. In the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, the necessary population to obtain this status is 20,000. In Bavaria 30,000 inhabitants are necessary; in Saxony, the minimum population is 17,500 (until 2008: 20,000). Usually, the motion is accepted. The status of a Gro√üe Kreisstadt was first implemented by the Baden-W√ºrttemberg Gemeindeordnung on 1 April 1956, followed by Bavaria, where in the course of a 1972 administrative reform, the status was conferred to 23 former independent cities regardless of the population. The smallest Gro√üe Kreisstadt is Rothenburg ob der Tauber with about 10,900 inhabitants. Further conferments require a quorum of 30,000, however, in 1998 the historic imperial cities of Dinkelsb√ºhl and Donauw√∂rth were elevated by Bavarian state law, though they did not reach the necessary number of inhabitants. Currently, there are 93 Gro√üe Kreisst√§dte in Baden- W√ºrttemberg, 29 in Bavaria, and 50 in Saxony.  Comparable towns in other states  In some German states other terms are used, for example Gro√üe selbst√§ndige Stadt in Lower Saxony, conclusively assigned by law to the towns of Celle, Cuxhaven, Goslar, Hameln, Hildesheim, Lingen and L√ºneburg in the course of the 1970s administrative reform. District-affiliated municipalities with a population of more than 30,000 hold the status of a Selbst√§ndige Gemeinde, territorial authorities with more than 20,000 inhabitants could apply for conferment by the Lower Saxon state government. In the states of Brandenburg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, the status of a Gro√üe kreisangeh√∂rige Stadt is conferred by the state government to municipalities with a certain population (Brandenburg: 35,000; North Rhine- Westphalia: 60,000; Rhineland-Palatinate: 25,000). In Brandenburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, there are also Mittlere kreisangeh√∂rige St√§dte with a population of more than 25,000. In Thuringia, a district-affiliated local authority ensuring adequate administrative and financial parameters may apply for the status. In 2005 the Schleswig-Holstein government declared Norderstedt in Segeberg District (part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region) a Gro√üe kreisangeh√∂rige Stadt. In Saarland, the towns of Sankt Ingbert and V√∂lklingen hold the comparable status of a district-affiliated Mittelstadt. In Hesse, seven towns with a population of more than 50,000 obtained the status of a Sonderstatusstadt: Bad Homburg vor der H√∂he, Fulda, Giessen, Hanau, Marburg, R√ºsselsheim and Wetzlar.

Velkamp: :A systematic study of projective planes over large classes of associative rings was initiated by D. Barbilian. His very general approach in [1940 and 41] remained rather unsatisfactory, however, his axioms were partly of a geometric nature, partly algebraic as pertaining to the ring of coordinates, and there were a number of difficulties which Barbilian could not overcome. Nevertheless, in 1989 John R. Faulkner wrote an article \\"Barbilian Planes\\" that clarified terminology and advanced the study. In his introduction he wrote: :A classical result from projective geometry is that a Desarguesian projective plane is coordinatized by an associative division ring. A Barbilian plane is a geometric structure which extends the notion of a projective plane and thereby allows a coordinate ring which is not necessarily a division ring.

Church of the Visitation is the most marble-decorated Baroque church of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It is situated in the Petra≈°i≈´nai elderate of Kaunas, Lithuania, on a peninsula in the Kaunas Reservoir near the Kaunas Yacht Club. It was declared a cultural monument and a site of Catholic pilgrimage in Lithuania.  History  Pa≈æaislis Monastery in winter Founded in 1662 by nobleman of Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Great Chancellor of Lithuania, Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac, for the Order of the Camaldolese Hermits, the main construction continued until 1674 and resumed in 1712. The monastery was designed by Pietro Puttini, Carlo Puttini and Giovanni Battista Frediani. Exclusive architectural solutions were used for the first time in Europe: a hexagonal church plan, and a concave facade. The interior stucco work is ascribed to Joan Merli and the frescos to Michelangelo Palloni. Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac burned the monastery construction bills before his death, saying, \\"What I have given to God, let him alone know.\\" and was buried in the monastery according to his testament. Writers of the time wrote that the construction cost 8 barrels of gold coins. In 1755 the addition of the towers and the dome was funded by the king's chamberlain Micha≈Ç Jan Pac. The monastery's church, decorated with highly polished marble, was damaged by the horses of Napoleon's army which was based in the complex. In 1832 the monastery was closed by the Russian authorities and later converted into an Orthodox church. The author of the Imperial Russian national anthem God Save the Tsar, Alexei Lvov, was interred there in 1870. In 1915-1918 when the Orthodox monks had fled a German war hospital was established in the monastery. The leaving Orthodox monks has stolen many treasures from the monastery, including the St. Mass Cup, decorated with over 1000 gemstones (over 400 diamonds, 300 rubies and 200 emeralds). After 1920 the ruined monastery returned to Roman Catholics and was restored by sisters of the Lithuanian convent of St. Casimir. After World War II, the Soviet authorities converted the church and monastery into an archive, a psychiatric hospital and finally an art gallery (in 1966). In 1990s the complex was returned by the newly independent Lithuania to the nuns of the convent and reconstruction work began. The monastery has the painting of Mary Belle Mother and Child, revered by the congregation, two bells of the church and St. Romuald titles, cast in the seventeenth century and the oldest church clock tower in Lithuania. Music festival Today the monastery is home to the annual international Pa≈æaislis Music Festival. It was started in 1996 and now lasts for three summer months and offers about 30 different concerts. The festival was visited by Yehudi Menuhin twice. It features classical music of diverse genres and styles, ranging from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to ABBA classics. Other concerts have taken place in many different venues across Lithuania, such as the Kaunas Castle, Klaipƒóda University, and even the Poci≈´nai Airport.

He was educated at Kingfisher College in Oklahoma and continued graduate studies in sociology at the University of Chicago. In 1916, he returned to the University of Chicago, as a faculty member. Burgess was hired as an urban sociologist at the University of Chicago. Burgess also served as the 24th President of the American Sociological Association (ASA). Scholarly work Burgess conducted influential work in a number of areas. =Introductory sociology textbook= Five years after his arrival as a professor at the University of a Chicago in 1921, Ernest Burgess would publish one of his most celebrated works. He collaborated with sociologist Robert Park to write a textbook called Introduction to the Science of Sociology (Park & Burgess, 1921). This was one of the most influential sociology texts ever written. Many people at the time referred to this book as the \\"Bible of Sociology\\". This book represented the observation and reflection of men who have seen life from very different points of view. The book discussed many topics such as the history of sociology, human nature, investigating problems, social interaction, competition, conflicts, assimilation and more. Overturning the arguments of a still ascendant eugenics movement, Burgess and Park argued that social disorganization, not heredity, is the cause of disease, crime and other characteristics of slum life. As the passage of successive waves of immigrants through such districts demonstrated, it is the slum area itself, and not the particular group living there, with which social pathologies are associated. Introduction to the Science of Sociology was so well organized and comprehensive that most graduate students taught by University of Chicago alumni were required to read it. This book was so informative that it was still being used decades after the death of Ernest Burgess. =Concentric zone model= Concentric zone model Burgess' groundbreaking research, in conjunction with his colleague, Robert E. Park, provided the foundation for The Chicago School. In The City (Park, Burgess, & McKenzie, 1925) they conceptualized the city into the concentric zones (Concentric zone model), including the central business district, transitional (industrial, deteriorating housing), working-class residential (tenements), residential, and commuter/suburban zones. They also viewed cities as something that experiences evolution and change, in the Darwinian sense. =Burgess method of unit-weighted regression= In the field of criminology, Burgess conducted work on predicting the success or failure of inmates on parole. He identified 21 measures believed to be associated with success on parole, converting these measures to a score of zero or one, with a score of one associated with parole success. For example, a man lacking in job skills would have a score of zero, while a man with job skills would have a score of one. He then added the scores to obtain a scale in which higher scores predicted a greater chance of success on parole (Burgess, 1928). Burgess has been credited with the birth of actuarial dangerousness prediction (Harcourt, 2006) The results showed that the scale worked well. To illustrate, for men with the highest scores from 14 to 21, the rate of parole success was 98%; for men with scores of 4 or less, the rate of parole success was only 24%. This method of combining scores has come to be called the Burgess method of unit-weighted regression. Hakeem (1948) reported that the Burgess method had \\"remarkable accuracy in prediction\\". Though more advanced methods of analysis have become common in the social sciences (such as multiple regression), they have yet to show a clear advantage over unit-weighted methods, so the Burgess method is still used in criminology (Gottfredson & Snyder, 2005). =Family and marriage= Ernest Burgess also spent a considerable amount of time studying the institutions of family and marriage. He was interested in developing a scientific measure that would predict a success rate in marriage. In his book Predicting Success or Failure in Marriage, which he wrote with Leonard Cottrell in 1939, he theorized that harmony in marriage requires a certain amount of adjustment in attitudes and social behavior by both the husband and the wife. Burgess and Cottrell developed a chart made for predicting marital success. In this chart they associated many different variables that they claimed affect stability in marriage. Burgess and Cottrell were however, often criticized for this work, since they attempted to measure marriage without actually including any component of love or affection. This is something that most people would say is the most important part of marriage. Notably, Ernest Burgess was never married. =Aging= Ernest Burgess also studied elderly people, especially the effects of retirement. This was something that was very neglected at that point in time. He collaborated with the government in researching the success of government programs for the elderly, the results of which were published in 1960 in the book Aging in Western Societies. Ernest Burgess served as the editor for this book. This book was the third volume in a three part series of handbooks written by the Inter-University Training Institute in Social Gerontology. Ernest Burgess was also involved with first and largest volume of the series. This volume dealt with comparative data and trends on subjects such as population structure, employment, retirement, income, housing and medical insurance. The second volume was made up of case studies from European countries and touched on such topics as housing, family relations, and senior centers. The third volume presented a statistical supplement of comparative data on conditions in different countries. The other five countries used are France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and West Germany. These countries were selected because they were closest in social structure and culture to the United States. This was done so that the background experience of other societies could be used to better the understand aging in the United States. Although Burgess did not write much of this book he certainly left his mark serving as the editor and writing the introduction.

He enrolled at the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Sciences, and was awarded his degree in mathematics in June 1928. He then went to Italy and studied statistics and actuarial studies at the University of Rome; he earned a Doctor of Statistical and Actuarial Sciences in July 1930. In 1930 he was appointed professor in the School of Statistics, Actuarial Studies, and Calculation, which had been established that year (it later became an Institute). The school was headed by Octav Onicescu. There Mihoc taught courses in actuarial mathematics from 1930 to 1948. On April 28, 1934, he earned his Doctorate in Mathematics from the University of Bucharest, in front of a commission consisting of Dimitrie Pompeiu, as chairman, Anton Davidoglu, and Octav Onicescu. The subject of his thesis was On the general properties of interdependent statistical variables. From 1937, Mihoc went to the University of Bucharest as assistant to Octav Onicescu, first at mechanics, then at algebra and probabilities calculation (1937-1942). That same year (1937) he also taught general mathematics with the students from the preparation year of the Polytechnic University of Bucharest.

Biography Born in New York capital, Albany, King was the son of Civil War general Rufus King, grandson of Columbia University president Charles King, and great grandson of Rufus King, who was one the signers of the United States Constitution on September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia. He graduated from West Point in 1866 and served in the Army during the Indian Wars under George Crook. He was wounded in the arm and head during the Battle of Sunset Pass forcing his retirement from the regular army as a captain in 1879. During this time he became acquainted with Buffalo Bill Cody. King would later write scripts for several of Cody's silent films. He also served in the Wisconsin National Guard from 1882 until 1897, becoming Adjutant General in 1895. In the spring of 1885, General King (at that time a captain in the National Guard) was riding in the area of Delafield, Wisconsin after visiting the Cushing homestead on the Bark River (present day Cushing Park) and the parents of the three historic Cushing Brothers. Captain King came upon a man dressed in a bathrobe drilling young men with broomsticks. Watching this futile exercise by toy soldiers, General King began to chuckle. Reverend Sydney T. Smythe asked what was so funny, and the reply was, \\"I mean no disrespect, sir, but let me show you how it is done.\\" He then proceeded to teach the young men the West Point Manual of Arms. The now Impressed Head Master of the St. Johns Military Academy (now the St. John's Northwestern Military Academy) inquired as to the gentlemen's name. Upon answering, Reverend Smythe shook hands and inquired on the spot of General King's availability. In 1898, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and sailed to the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The fighting with Spain was over by the time he arrived, but he assisted in the surrender negotiations. During the following Philippine-American War, King was placed in command of the 1st Brigade in Henry W. Lawton's division. He led his brigade during the Battle of Manila and sailed for Santa Cruz with Lawton's division. He was incapacitated by sickness during the Battle of Santa Cruz, but he returned to fight in the following Battle of Pagsanjan. He took part in the final major campaigns before the fighting turned primarily to guerilla warfare. Cover of An Apache Princess by Charles King He returned to the United States and was active in the Wisconsin National Guard and in training troops for World War I. He wrote and edited over 60 books and novels. Among his list of titles are Campaigning with Crook, Fort Frayne, Under Fire and Daughter of the Sioux. Gravesite in Forest Home Cemetery General King and his wife lived in the Carlton Hotel in Milwaukee. King commuted daily by train to Saint John's Military Academy. He routinely sat on the porch of the Holt house on campus and told the cadets, which included his grandson, tales of the old west. General King was a Companion of the Wisconsin Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. King was an accomplished writer. Among his notable works is his biography of Ulysses S. Grant, entitled, The true Ulysses S.

Pompeiu (; ‚Äì 8 October 1954) was a renowned Romanian mathematician, professor at the University of Bucharest, titular member of the Romanian Academy, and President of the Chamber of Deputies. Biography He was born in 1873 in BroscƒÉu»õi, Boto»ôani County, in a family of well-to-do peasants. After completing high school in nearby Dorohoi, he went to study at the Normal Teachers School in Bucharest, where he had Alexandru Odobescu as a teacher. After obtaining his diploma in 1893, he taught for five years at schools in Gala»õi and Ploie»ôti. In 1898 he went to France, where he studied mathematics at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). He obtained his Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 1905, with thesis On the continuity of complex variable functions written under the direction of Henri Poincar√©. After returning to Romania, Pompeiu was named Professor of Mechanics at the University of Ia»ôi. In 1912, he assumed a chair at the University of Bucharest. In the early 1930s he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a member of Nicolae Iorga's Democratic Nationalist Party, and served as President of the Chamber of Deputies for a year. In 1934, Pompeiu was elected titular member of the Romanian Academy, while in 1943 he was elected to the Romanian Academy of Sciences. In 1945, he became the founding director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy. He died in Bucharest in 1954. A boulevard in the Pipera neighborhood of the city is named after him, and so is a school in his hometown of BroscƒÉu»õi. Research Pompeiu's contributions were mainly in the field of mathematical analysis, complex functions theory, and rational mechanics. In an article published in 1929, he posed a challenging conjecture in integral geometry, now widely known as the Pompeiu problem. Among his contributions to real analysis there is the construction, dated 1906, of non-constant, everywhere differentiable functions, with derivative vanishing on a dense set.

Morrison Professor of History Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley (1946‚Äì1983), was a celebrated historian of slavery, the American Civil War, and Reconstruction. He was a visiting professor at Harvard University and Colgate University, Commonwealth Lecturer at the University of London, Fulbright Lecturer at the University of Munich, and has held the Harmsworth Chair at Oxford University. In 1989, he received the American Historical Association Award for Scholarly Distinction. Then in 1993, came the prestigious Lincoln Prize for lifetime achievement by the Civil War Institute at Gettysburg College. Life and career Stampp was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1912; his parents were of German Protestant descent. His mother was a Baptist who forbade alcohol and strictly observed the Sabbath; his father, a tough disciplinarian in the old-world German style. His family suffered through the Great Depression, \\"there was never enough money,\\" but Stampp worked a number of small odd jobs as a teen, managing to save enough to afford tuition, first, at Milwaukee State Teachers' College, and then at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He earned both his B.A. and M.A. there in 1935 and 1936 respectively under the influences of Charles A. Beard (author of An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States) and William B. Hesseltine (known for coining the phrase about intellectual history: it's \\"like nailing jelly to the wall\\"). Hesseltine supervised Stampp's dissertation; Stampp remembered him as a \\"bastard\\" during this time, but the two managed to work together successfully through the completion of Stampp's Ph.D. in 1942. He then spent brief stints at the University of Arkansas and the University of Maryland, College Park, 1942‚Äì46, before joining the faculty at Berkeley. His teaching tenure ran 37 years; in 2006, Stampp celebrated six decades of association there. During his undergraduate years at Wisconsin, Stampp was a member of the Theta Xi fraternity. He died on July 10, 2009 in Oakland, California.Weber, Bruce. \\"Kenneth M. Stampp, Civil War Historian, Dies at 96\\". The New York Times, 15 July 2009. P. A8. Retrieved 20 July 2009. =The Peculiar Institution= In his first major book, The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South (1956), Stampp countered the arguments of historians such as Ulrich Phillips, who characterized slavery as an essentially benign and paternalistic institution that promoted Southern racial harmony. Stampp asserted, to the contrary, that African Americans actively resisted slavery, not just through armed uprisings but also through work slowdowns, the breaking of tools, theft from masters, and diverse other means. Through a lengthy scholarly career, Stampp insisted that the moral debate over slavery, and no form of guilt-ridden rationalization, lay at the crux of the Civil War. Kevin Fagan, \\"Kenneth Stampp, historian at UC Berkeley, dies\\", San Francisco Chronicle, 22 July 2009. D-5 Later work by other historians qualified certain of the book's claims, but The Peculiar Institution remains a central text in the study of U.S. slavery. =Criticism of the Dunning School= His next study, The Era of Reconstruction, also revised a scholarly stronghold, that of the story put forth by William A. Dunning (1857‚Äì1922) and his school of followers. In this rendering, the South emerges mercilessly beaten, \\"prostrate in defeat, before a ruthless, vindictive conqueror, who plundered its land and...turned its society upside down....\\" The North's greatest sin, according to Dunning, consisted of relinquishing control of the Southern governments to \\"ignorant, half-civilized former slaves.\\" To systematically refute Dunning's interpretation, Stampp amassed a trove of secondary sources. He was criticized for not employing more primary material. Stampp's rejoinder was seen by some historians as a pro-Northern rationalization: though he clearly admitted that the North walked out on Reconstruction while it was nowhere near completion, he went on to claim that in light of the passage of the 14th and 15th amendments, Reconstruction was a success; he deemed it \\"the last great crusade of nineteenth-century romantic reformers.\\"Kenneth Stampp, The Era of Reconstruction, 1865-1877 (New York: Vintage Books, 1967), 101.

This new entity purchased luxury hotel and resort chain Aman Resorts from DLF for $360 million. In July 2014, Amanat filed suit in the High Court of London against Vladislav Doronin, claiming Doronin committed breaches of a shareholders' agreement and forced the unlawful ouster of Adrian Zecha as CEO. Amanat claimed the decision to remove Zecha did not have board approval. The ruling, by the High Court, which was reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, reinstated Zecha as CEO, which was viewed as a victory for Amanat. Two days later, Doronin filed a counterclaim in New York, but the judge ruled that the lawsuit must be decided in England. In July 2014, London's High Court permitted a board decision which replaced Zecha with Olivier Jolivet to stand. In March 2016 the High Court in London published an order which confirmed the settlement between Doronin and Amanat, ousting Amanat from the Aman Resorts ownership group. Litigation Amanat has been involved in a number of high-profile lawsuits during his career: * Shortly after the acquisition of Tradescape by E*Trade, litigation commenced between MarketXT and E*Trade alleging fraud on the part of the other. * Summit Entertainment withdrew and retracted its threat against Amanat that he had \\"misrepresented that he's involved in the ownership, management, decision- making, and operations\\". Relating to the same Amanat filed libel proceedings against British newspapers who called him an imposter in relation to his claims of involvement with Summit Entertainment, which led to them apologising, publishing a retraction and making payments to a charity of Amanat's choice. Summit Entertainments's CEO and Chairman issued letters to Amanat confirming his ownership and control of a board seat. * The disputes relating to the ownership and control of Aman Resorts have led to litigation in both New York and London. * Amanat was also involved in lawsuits in connection with Bridges TV. Bankruptcy In 2004 a bankruptcy petition was lodged against Amanat. The circumstances of the filing were highly unusual.

Fortune also reported that \\"[b]efore the case was over, the bankruptcy judge, Gropper, found that Amanat executed fraudulent conveyances, deceived creditors, and backdated documents.\\" Arrest and conviction In July 2016 Amanat was arrested as part of the conspiracy case against former technology IPTV company KIT Digital. Prosecutors asserted that Amanat with Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, Stephen E. Maiden and an unnamed individual used an investment vehicle controlled by Tuzman to purchase KIT Digital shares. Maiden was sentenced in February 2015 to seven years in prison on a separate matter; Tuzman served time in prison in Colombia and was extradited to the U.S. to face charges.plainsite Former Chief Financial Officer Robin Smyth pleaded guilty to criminal charges in March 2016 and has been assisting prosecutors. Amanat previously sued Tuzman asserting breach of contract. The fraud trial commenced in October 2017. The prosecution accused Omanat of \\"lies upon lies\\" in their opening statements in relation to the fraud allegations. Defense lawyers accused the prosecution's star witness Stephen E Maiden of having high-ranking DOJ ties and of losing most of his funds money before investing in Kit. In December 2017, Amanat was found guilty of defrauding Kit investors along with his associate Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, the former KIT Digital CEO. Tuzman and Amanat had been accused of conspiring to inflate KIT's trading volume and share price between 2008 and 2011 in an effort to hide their devastating losses. The verdict came after 6 weeks of trial. Three government witnesses who pleaded guilty, including two former KIT executives and a disgraced hedge-fund founder, told jurors of related frauds being directed by Tuzman and Amanat in an effort to hide their disastrous investment losses.

Akihabara is a district in Chiyoda, Tokyo where many otaku, or obsessive anime, manga, and video game fans gather. Definition Akiba-kei is a Japanese slang term meaning \\"Akihabara style\\". It dates back to the early 80s and refers to a subset of otaku who spend much of their time in and around the Akihabara area of Tokyo and are known for their strong interest in \\"fantasy worlds...anime, manga, maids, idols, and games\\". Akiba-kei have also been characterized as being \\"interested in ruminating about domestic items and creating fan works based on these existing elements.\\" Location The Akihabara area in central Tokyo is well known as a marketplace of technology; it has ties to the Japanese video game industry, as well as to anime and manga publishers. In addition to patronizing the famous electronics stores around them, Akiba-kei frequently open their own shops in Akihabara. Many of these shops are run by Akiba-kei in cosplay, who may claim that such attire is the rule for them rather than the exception. The shops offer a wide variety of goods and services: some sell model or ornamental weaponry; others are modeled after antique reading rooms; and still others sell quirky or innovative foodstuffs. In popular culture One distinctive feature of Akiba-kei within Japan's larger popular culture is that for the most part they belong to an older generation, who are well-versed in the history of Akihabara before it ever became a center of pop culture. Some of them, affectionately known as \\"Akiba historians\\", have worked in and around the Akihabara area for decades, and witnessed firsthand the changes the area went through. In addition to running shops and participating vigorously in Akiba-kei culture, they may also be fonts of knowledge about Akihabara and its environs in ways that relate particularly to their areas of interests. In early 2008, a project was undertaken to attempt to merge some aspects of Akiba-kei culture with Shibuya-kei, Japan's \\"super-chic internationalist music, fashion, interior, and design movement\\" that began in Japan in the 1990s.

Recorded in 1989 and 1990 and released in April 1991, it was the first time that members David Sylvian, Mick Karn, Steve Jansen and Richard Barbieri had collaborated as a four-piece since 1982. The album peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart.  Background and content  Trouser Press wrote: \\"the album doesn't sound drastically different from any of their previous work together, but successfully revives Japan's late-period neo-tribal rhythms and vaguely Asian feel.\\" The name Rain Tree Crow was chosen to mark a break from Japan's past, with the intention of creating a new long-term project. As the music turned out to be less commercial than originally envisaged, all members of the band aside from Sylvian became amenable to the idea of retaining the Japan moniker, in order to gain maximum exposure. Virgin records pressured the musicians to let them market the album under the name Japan; however, Sylvian was adamant that this would not take place. Sylvian‚Äôs opinion prevailed and the album was released as by Rain Tree Crow.  Release and reception  \\"Blackwater\\" was released as the album's only single and reached number 62 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1991. The album reached number 24 in the UK Albums Chart.

In May 2018, Necco was sold for $17.33 million to Round Hill Investments LLC, run by billionaire C. Dean Metropoulos; Round Hill Investments which then went into a bankruptcy auction in May, 2018, with Spangler Candy Company Spangler Candy Company being the winning bidder. The company was best known for its namesake candy, Necco Wafers (originally called \\"Hub Wafers\\") dating back to 1847. Other prominent products have included its seasonal Sweethearts Conversation Hearts, and brands such as the Clark Bar, Haviland Thin Mints and Sky Bar. History =Formation= Necco dated its origins to Chase and Company, a company founded by brothers Oliver R. and Silas Edwin Chase in 1847. Having previously invented and patented the first American candy machine, the Chase brothers continued to design and create machinery that made assortments of candies, such as their popular sugar wafers. =1900s= The Necco complex in South Boston which had a sign on the roof of the factory reading, \\"New England Confectionery Co.\\", as seen from across the Fort Point Channel, circa 1902‚Äì1907 Two other confectionery companies, Ball and Fobes, founded by confectioner Daniel Fobes in 1848, and Bird, Wright and Company, a confectionery company based in Boston and founded in 1856, joined forces with Chase and Company in 1901 to become the three members of the original Necco family. The three confectionery firms then moved into a newly constructed manufacturing plant in the Fort Point‚ÄìSouth Boston Waterfront area of Boston, Massachusetts, one year later and became the largest establishment devoted entirely to confectionery production in the United States. The Boston Wharf Company developed the 1902 complex of four five-story buildings at 253 Summer Street and 11-37 Melcher Street. BWC named the adjacent streets Necco Court, Necco Street, and Necco Place.Necco Place is marked on Google Maps as Necco Court, but see: City of Boston Fort Point Channel District Map In 1907, 5 and 6 Necco Court were added behind the existing complex, connected by a four-story interior bridge. With nearby rail and water transportation, BWC specialized in shipment and storage of sugar and molasses. The Domino Sugar factory was also located nearby. Success prompted the company, in 1906, to introduce a profit sharing plan. Necco continued its production while the confectionery industry continued to boom through the turn of the century. Around the same time, businessman David L. Clark began experimenting with his own candy creations in his home outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He began selling the Clark candy bar for five cents and shipping his creation to soldiers fighting in World War I. At the same time, Charles Miller started a business manufacturing and selling homemade candy in the Boston area. Clark's creation and Miller's Mary Jane quickly become two of the most popular candy creations in the country. Mass.

In 1927, Necco moved into a new factory on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, which was then the largest factory in the world, devoted entirely to candy, as seen in a photograph of a 1928 Necco Wafers truck. Necco continued its dominance of the candy-manufacturing business through much of the first half of the 20th century. In 1942, the U.S. Government requisitioned a \\"major portion of the production of the wafers, during World War II since the candy doesn't melt and is 'practically indestructible' during transit,\\" This continued until 1945. For several years, Necco was the first, and exclusive, licensed distributor of Rolo candy in the US.Jason Liebig (June 5, 2012). \\"Jason Liebig  CollectingCandy.com\\" After losing the license to Hershey, for a time Necco marketed an identical product called \\"Milk Chocolate Caramel Roll\\". Necco, still a family-run business in 1963 but having financial problems, was acquired by United Industrial Syndicate of New York. In 1978, after several reorganizations and seven company presidents, Domenic Antonellis was named its CEO, a role he would play for nearly 30 years. From the end of the war through the 1990s, Necco continued to acquire small candy companies throughout the United States and Europe, and with those companies, the rights to manufacture their trademarked candy bars. It acquired nearby Page & Shaw in 1960. Wisconsin's Stark Candy Company, which was founded in 1939, was acquired in 1988. The acquisition of Stark's Sweethearts, combined with Necco's existing Sweet Talk line of candies, made Necco the leading manufacturer of candy \\"conversation\\" hearts. In 1999, Pittsburgh-based Clark Bar America, Inc. was purchased, and by 2000 the company had 1200 employees. =2000s= Necco's Sweethearts as of 2011 Banana Split chews Necco Wafers In 2003, Necco consolidated its facilities to share a , Revere, Massachusetts, plant and warehouse, where its international headquarters resides to this day. The site employed more than 700 workers. Since April 2004, the Necco building at 250 Massachusetts Ave in Cambridge has been occupied by the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research. The water tower was repainted with a double helix to represent the biomedical research being performed within.CambridgeHistory.org In 2005, the structure, which is still referred to as the Necco candy factory, was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. By 2005, the company's annual revenue was around $100 million, at which level it was to remain for several years. In December 2007,American Capital Invests in the One Stop Buyout of NECCO , a December 28, 2007 press release from the American Capital website a buyout of Necco was orchestrated by the private equity fund American Capital Strategies (in partnership with Clear Creek Capital and Domenic Antonellis, the company's CEO). Necco announced the closure of its Pewaukee, Wisconsin, plant in March 2008. In August 2008, Necco replaced its CEO with Richard Krause, a former Procter & Gamble executive, who in February 2009 announced plans to \\"expand its brand now in the U.S. so it can expand globally later\\", aiming for a 30% growth in revenue by 2011. In November 2010, Necco was listed for sale with a New York broker; although by February 2011, American Capital announced that the sale was off for the time being. In July 2013, United Service Organizations sued Necco in U.S. District Court for continuing to use their trademarks after their 2009 marketing deal had expired.\\"USO not sweet on NECCO\\" In February 2014, the case (1:13-cv-11754) was dismissed due to an out of court settlement. =Company tax breaks= The 2011 news that the company was no longer for sale was accompanied by reports that the company had supplied the city of Revere with five years' worth of overdue reports required as part of a tax increment financing (TIF) deal the company had received from the city; those reports \\"seemed to indicate that Necco has‚Äîfor several years‚Äînot created the jobs they promised in the TIF agreement\\"; as of March 2011 Necco employed 483 people, including 30 Revere residents. The company's failure to meet the terms of its TIF agreement led the Massachusetts Economic Assistance Coordinating Council to decertify Necco's participation in the economic development program that administers the agreement. With the support of Revere's mayor, the city council voted to maintain the tax break, which saves the company $300,000, reducing their annual property taxes to $750,000. At one city hearing, Miles Arnone, a managing director of American Capital, had a heated exchange with city council member George Rotondo (who was running for mayor). Arnone was upset about being forced to talk about Necco's health \\"when you're down 30 percent\\"; the public exposure of the issue was raising concerns from large customers of Necco such as CVS Pharmacy and Target. =Sale and closure= In May 2017, it was announced that the Revere complex containing the company headquarters and major manufacturing center had been sold for $54 million to Massachusetts real estate developers Atlantic Management and VMD Companies. The complex was leased to Necco until the end of August 2018. In March 2018, chief executive Michael McGee announced that, unless a buyer for the company could be found, most of Necco's workforce could be laid off as early as May 6, 2018. With a workforce of approximately 500, Necco was the largest employer in Revere at the time. Online sales of Necco Wafers and other products subsequently spiked, with buyers concerned that the candy would be discontinued, some even offering to sell a car for Necco Wafers. The assets of Necco were sold in a bankruptcy auction in May, 2018, with Spangler Candy Company having the winning bid of $18.83 million. However, Spangler backed out of the transaction and the company was instead sold for $17.33 million to Round Hill Investments, owned by billionaire C. Dean Metropoulos. They briefly operated the candy manufacturer under the name of Sweethearts, LLC. Two months later, in July, Round Hill Investments announced the immediate closure of Necco's Revere facility following the sale of Necco to an unnamed candy manufacturer. About 230 workers were laid off when the Revere plant closed. At the time, Necco was the oldest candy company in the United States. In July 2018, Necco workers were reportedly in high demand by other companies. The purchaser was subsequently identified as the Spangler Candy Company, who had backed out of the purchase months earlier. They planned to restart manufacture of Necco wafers, Sweethearts and Canada Mints, but other Necco-owned brands would not be retained. The Clark Bar was sold in early September to Boyer Candy Company, while other brands and equipment were disbursed at auction at the end of September. Candy buttons were bought by Doscher's Candies, and Banana Split and Mint Juleps chews along with Slap Stix lollipops went to the Reading, Pennsylvania-based Mega Candy Co. Haviland Thin Mints and Mighty Malt Milk Balls were sold to Minnesota-based Log House Food. Equipment and foodstock were disbursed internationally. Some unclaimed brands, such as Sky Bar, would later be sold in online auctions, while Mary Jane candies, unsold at auction, were licenced by Spangler to Atkinson Candy Company of Lufkin, Texas. In October 2019, it was announced that the Revere complex would be leased to Amazon for use as a distribution center.

Early career For many years an active and intrepid warrior in the service of France, Pfyffer won fame by safely leading the royal family of Charles IX from Meaux to Paris while under Huguenot attack (1567). Defender of Catholic Church Elected chief magistrate for Lucerne in 1571, Pfyffer ruled there until his death. He made the city the centre of Catholic Counter-Reformation activity in Switzerland. His Golden League (1586) (also called the Borromean League after Cardinal Carlo Borromeo) nearly led to the destruction of the Swiss Confederation. The alliance of the seven Catholic cantons pledged itself to use armed force to expel heretics. Its elevation of religious interests severely strained the civil union. The canton of Appenzell divided along religious lines. Pfyffer established close relations with the Catholic League of Philip II of Spain and Henri I, Duc de Guise. He concluded a Swiss alliance with Spain (1587) against the accession of Henry of Navarre (Henry IV) to the French throne. Pfyffer also acquired a substantial fortune from foreign pensions and as a supplier of mercenaries to the pope.

In 2009, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Thomas A. Steitz and Ada Yonath, \\"for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome\\".Venkatraman Ramakrishnan Audio Interview Official Nobel Foundation website telephone interview He was elected President of the Royal Society for a term of five years starting in 2015. Since 1999, he has worked as a group leader at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, UK. Venki Ramakrishnan Education and early life Ramakrishnan was born in Chidambaram in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, India to C. V. Ramakrishnan and Rajalakshmi Ramakrishnan in a Hindu family. Both his parents were scientists, and his father was head of the Department of Biochemistry at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda.http://www.asianwindow.com/tag/venkatraman-venki-ramakrishnan/ At the time of his birth, Ramakrishnan's father was away from India doing postdoctoral research with David E. Green at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in the US. His mother obtained a PhD in Psychology from McGill University in 1959. completing it in only 18 months, and was mentored by Donald O. Hebb. Lalita Ramakrishnan, his younger sister, is professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Ramakrishnan moved to Vadodara (previously also known as Baroda) in Gujarat at the age of three, where he had his schooling at Convent of Jesus and Mary, except for spending 1960‚Äì61 in Adelaide, Australia. Following his pre-science at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, he did his undergraduate studies in the same university on a National Science Talent Scholarship, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 1971. At the time, the physics course at Baroda was new, and based in part on The Berkeley Physics Course and The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Immediately after graduation he moved to the U.S., where he obtained his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Physics from Ohio University in 1976 for research into the ferroelectric phase transition of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) supervised by Tomoyasu Tanaka. Then he spent two years studying biology as a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego while making a transition from theoretical physics to biology. Career and research Ramakrishnan began work on ribosomes as a postdoctoral fellow with Peter Moore at Yale University. After his post-doctoral fellowship, he initially could not find a faculty position even though he had applied to about 50 universities in the U.S. He continued to work on ribosomes from 1983-95 as a staff scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1995 he moved to the University of Utah as a Professor of Biochemistry, and in 1999, he moved to his current position at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, where he had also been a sabbatical visitor during 1991-92 on a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1999, Ramakrishnan's laboratory published a 5.5 angstrom resolution structure of the 30S subunit. The following year, his laboratory determined the complete molecular structure of the 30S subunit of the ribosome and its complexes with several antibiotics. This was followed by studies that provided structural insights into the mechanism that ensures the fidelity of protein biosynthesis. In 2007, his laboratory determined the atomic structure of the whole ribosome in complex with its tRNA and mRNA ligands. Since 2013, he has primarily used cryo-EM to determine new ribosome structures. Ramakrishnan is also known for his past work on histone and chromatin structure. his most cited papers (according to Google Scholar) have been published in Nature, Science, and Cell. In an interview in July 2018, he said that Britain's decision to leave the European Union (Brexit) was hurting Britain's reputation as a good place to work in science, commenting \\"It's very hard for the science community to see any advantages in Brexit. They are pretty blunt about that.\\" He saw advantages to both the UK and the EU for Britain to continue to be engaged in Galileo and Euratom, which, unlike the European Medicines Agency, are not EU agencies. =Views= Ramakrishnan fears a no deal Brexit would harm science. Ramakrishnan wrote, \\"A deal on science is in the best interests of Europe as a whole and should not be sacrificed as collateral damage over disagreements on other issues. If we are going to successfully tackle global problems like climate change, human disease and food security, we can't do so in isolation. There is no scenario where trashing our relationships with our closest scientific collaborators in the EU gets us closer to these goals.\\"A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science community The Independent =Awards and honours= Ramakrishnan at the Nobel Prize Press conference in 2009. Ramakrishnan was elected a Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2002, a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2003, and a Member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2004. In 2007, Ramakrishnan was awarded the Louis-Jeantet Prize for MedicineLouis-Jeantet Prize and the Datta Lectureship and Medal of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS). In 2008, he won the Heatley Medal of the British Biochemical Society. Since 2008, he is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge and a foreign Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2010, and has received honorary degrees from the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, University of Utah and University of Cambridge. He is also an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford. In 2020 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/american-philosophical-society- welcomes-new-members-2020 Also in 2020, he became a board member of The British Library. In 2009, Ramakrishnan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Thomas A. Steitz and Ada Yonath. He received India's second highest civilian honor, the Padma Vibhushan, in 2010. Ramakrishnan was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to Molecular Biology, but does not generally use the title \\"Sir\\". In the same year, he was awarded the Sir Hans Krebs Medal by the FEBS. In 2014, he was awarded the XLVI Jim√©nez- D√≠az Prize by the Fundaci√≥n Conchita R√°bago (Spain). In 2017, Ramakrishnan received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Ramakrishnan was included as one of 25 Greatest Global Living Indians by NDTV Channel, India on 14 December 2013. His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads: While he prefers not to use titles and post-nominals in reference, Ramakrishnan is entitled to use the title of \\"Sir\\" and post- nominals of \\"Kt\\", FRS, and PRS in Commonwealth countries. Personal life Ramakrishnan married Vera Rosenberry, an author and illustrator of children's books, in 1975. His stepdaughter, Tanya Kapka, is a doctor in Oregon, and his son, Raman Ramakrishnan, is a cellist based in New York.

There are several mathematical and conceptual definitions of fairness. TCP fairness Congestion control mechanisms for new network transmission protocols or peer-to-peer applications must interact well with TCP. TCP fairness requires that a new protocol receive no larger share of the network than a comparable TCP flow. This is important as TCP is the dominant transport protocol on the Internet, and if new protocols acquire unfair capacity they tend to cause problems such as congestion collapse. This was the case with the first versions of RealMedia's streaming protocol: it was based on UDP and was widely blocked at organizational firewalls until a TCP-based version was developed. TCP throughput unfairness over WiFi is a critical problem and need further investigations. Jain's fairness index Raj Jain's equation, :\\\\mathcal{J} (x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n) = \\\\frac{( \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i )^2}{n \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{i=1}^n {x_i}^2}=\\\\frac{\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}^2}{\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}^2}}=\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\widehat{c_{\\\\rm v}}^2} rates the fairness of a set of values where there are n users, x_i is the throughput for the ith connection, and \\\\widehat{c_{\\\\rm v}} is the sample coefficient of variation . The result ranges from \\\\tfrac{1}{n} (worst case) to 1 (best case), and it is maximum when all users receive the same allocation. This index is \\\\tfrac{k}{n} when k users equally share the resource, and the other n-k users receive zero allocation. This metric identifies underutilized channels and is not unduly sensitive to atypical network flow patterns. To achieve a given fairness level F, one approximate method is to let x_k=A \\\\cdot k^\\\\alpha, where :\\\\alpha=\\\\frac{1-F+\\\\sqrt{1-F}}{F} and A is an arbitrary factor, typically used for normalization. This gives an allocation with a fairness close to F, and the allocation can then be refined to get even closer. Note this also allows for a prioritization of allocation, as the x_ks will be sorted. An exact method is to let x_k=A \\\\cdot e^{2\\\\alpha k}, where \\\\alpha solves :\\\\frac{\\\\tanh(n\\\\alpha)}{n\\\\tanh(\\\\alpha)}=F. A simple way to calculate \\\\alpha is to use Newton's Method on \\\\ln\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\tanh(n\\\\alpha)-\\\\tanh(\\\\alpha)}{(nF-1)\\\\cdot \\\\tanh(\\\\alpha)} \\\\right )=0, which converges consistently and fairly quickly. Both of these methods give non-integer allocations, generally, and sometimes integer allocations are required. This can be done by using one of the above allocation methods, rounding down each allocation to the nearest integer (x_k'=\\\\left \\\\lfloor x_k \\\\right \\\\rfloor ), and then iteratively allocating one unit to a user, with the probability that user k receives it is proportional to x_k-\\\\left \\\\lfloor x_k \\\\right \\\\rfloor . Max-min fairness Max-min fairness is said to be achieved by an allocation if and only if the allocation is feasible and an attempt to increase the allocation of any flow necessarily results in the decrease in the allocation of some other flow with an equal or smaller allocation. A max-min fair allocation is achieved when bandwidth is allocated equally and in infinitesimal increments to all flows until one is satisfied, then amongst the remainder of the flows and so on until all flows are satisfied or the bandwidth is exhausted. Fairly shared spectrum efficiency In packet radio wireless networks, The fairly shared spectrum efficiency (FSSE) can be used as a combined measure of fairness and system spectrum efficiency. The system spectral efficiency is the aggregate throughput in the network divided by the utilized radio bandwidth in hertz. The FSSE is the portion of the system spectral efficiency that is shared equally among all active users (with at least one backlogged data packet in queue or under transmission). In case of scheduling starvation, the FSSE would be zero during certain time intervals. In case of equally shared resources, the FSSE would be equal to the system spectrum efficiency. To achieve max-min fairness, the FSSE should be maximized. FSSE is useful especially when analyzing advanced radio resource management (RRM) schemes, for example channel adaptive scheduling, for cellular networks with best-effort packet data service. In such system it may be tempting to optimize the spectrum efficiency (i.e. the throughput). However, that might result in scheduling starvation of \\"expensive\\" users at far distance from the access point, whenever another active user is closer to the same or an adjacent access point. Thus the users would experience unstable service, perhaps resulting in a reduced number of happy customers. Optimizing the FSSE results in a compromise between fairness (especially avoiding scheduling starvation) and achieving high spectral efficiency. If the cost of each user is known, in terms of consumed resources per transferred information bit, the FSSE measure may be redefined to reflect proportional fairness. In a proportional fair system, this \\"proportionally fair shared spectrum efficiency\\" (or \\"fairly shared radio resource cost\\") is maximized. This policy is less fair since \\"expensive\\" users are given lower throughput than others, but still scheduling starvation is avoided. QoE fairness The idea of QoE fairness is to quantify fairness among users by considering the Quality of Experience (QoE) as perceived by the end user. This is especially of importance in network management where operators want to keep their users sufficiently satisfied (i.e. high QoE) in a fair manner, see QoE management. Several approaches have been proposed to ensure network-wide QoE fairness especially for adaptive video streaming. In contrast to network related measures like throughput, QoE is typically not measured on ratio scales. Hence, fairness measures like Jain's fairness index cannot be applied, as the measurement scale requires to be a ratio scale with a clearly defined zero point (see examples of misuse for coefficients of variation). QoE may be measure on interval scales. A typical example is a 5-point mean opinion score (MOS) scale, with 1 indicating lowest quality and 5 indicating highest quality. While the coefficient of variation is meaningless, the standard deviation \\\\sigma provides a measure of the dispersion of QoE among users. Hossfeld et al. have proposed a QoE Fairness index which considers the lower bound L and the higher bound H of the rating scale. :F=1- \\\\frac{2\\\\sigma}{H-L} The QoE fairness index F has some desired properties like scale and metric independence. The unit of measurement does not matter. Any linear transformation of the QoE values does not change the value of the fairness index. The fairness index is bounded in the interval [0;1] with 1 indicating perfect QoE fairness ‚Äì all users experience the same quality. 0 indicates total unfairness, e.g. 50% of users experience highest QoE H and 50% experience lowest QoE L. Product-based Fairness Indices Product-based fairness indices are based on the general fairness formulation: :\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\prod_{i=0}^n f\\\\left(\\\\frac{x_i}{\\\\max(\\\\mathbf{x})}\\\\right), where f is an arbitrary transformation function. For f to be a valid transformation function: f(x) \\\\in [0,1] for 0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 1. The resulting index thus has a value between 0 and 1. As Jain's fairness index is said to be unduly sensitive under atypical conditions, the product-based fairness can be defined arbitrarily to obtain a desired sensitivity. An allocation that has fairness F according to the formulation above can be given by :x_j=A \\\\cdot f^{-1}\\\\left (\\\\exp\\\\left (\\\\ln(F) \\\\cdot g(j)/\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}g(i) \\\\right ) \\\\right ), where g(x) is any non- decreasing function with g(0)=0 . it is often convenient to take g to be something like g(x)=x^m. Assuming f is increasing and f(0)=0 and f(1)=1, this gives a minimum to maximum ratio of about :f^{-1}\\\\left ( \\\\exp\\\\left ( \\\\frac{m+1}{n}\\\\ln(F) \\\\right ) \\\\right ). The linear product-based fairness index has f(x)=x and looks as follows: :\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\frac{\\\\prod_{i=0}^n x_i}{\\\\max(\\\\mathbf{x})^n}. It is observed that \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{x}) is very sensitive for small values of x_i/\\\\max(\\\\mathbf{x}). For example \\\\mathbf{h}=\\\\\\\\{20,10,5,1\\\\\\\\} yields \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{h})=0.00625 = G's fairness index = The G's fairness index \\\\mathcal{I} is primarily used by telecom operators in the context of bandwidth allocation. G's kth-order fairness index scales the fractions of the product-based fairness index by a powered sine transformation f(x)=\\\\sin(x\\\\pi/2)^{\\\\frac{1}{k}}: :\\\\mathcal{G}_k(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\prod^n_{i=1}\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi x_i}{2\\\\max(\\\\mathbf{x})}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{k}}, where k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^+. The first quadrant of the sine wave is used as a mapping function to inflate fractions . As such, the sensitivity of the product-based fairness is decreased for values close to \\\\max(\\\\mathbf{x}), while the index still outputs a value between 0 and 1. Compared to Jain's fairness index, G's fairness index yields smaller values, it is more sensitive to potential unfair bandwidth distribution and can go to zero. In the context of networks, the latter is an advantage over Jain's fairness index when a few values in a set drop to low levels. Moreover, Jain's fairness index is deemed as an average user perception of fairnesshttp://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/atmf/ftp/af_fair.pdf whereas G's fairness index is focused more on equality within a group. For example for \\\\mathbf{m}=\\\\\\\\{20,20,20,0\\\\\\\\} we get \\\\mathrm{Jain}(\\\\mathbf{m})=0.75 and \\\\mathcal{G_1}(\\\\mathbf{m})=0. = Bossaer's fairness index = Whereas G's fairness index inflates the fractions closer to \\\\max(\\\\mathbf{x}), the Bossaer's fairness index inflates the fractions closer to 0. Bossaer's kth- order transformation function f(x)=x^{\\\\frac{1}{k}} yields the fairness index: :\\\\mathcal{B}_k(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\prod_{i=1}^n\\\\left(\\\\frac{x_i}{\\\\max(\\\\mathbf{x})}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{k}}. The linear product-based fairness indices is a special case of Bossaer's where k=1.  Causal fairness  Causal fairness measures the frequency with which two nearly identical users or applications who differ only in a set of characteristics with respect to which resource allocation must be fair receive identical treatment. Other metrics Several other metrics have been defined, such as Worst Case Fairness. Notes  Further reading  * Almeida, A.; Casetti, C.; Oueslati, S.; Avratchenkov, K. & Johansson, M.

At the time of building it was one of three lights in the Isles of Scilly, the others being the Bishop Rock and St Agnes lighthouse. The light was modernised in 1966, automated in 1987 and the island designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1995. It is now managed by the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust, and except for the maintenance of the Grade 2 listed lighthouse, landing is not allowed. History A cairn or burial chamber was destroyed when the lighthouse was built. Cairns on the Isles of Scilly date back to the Bronze Age and at that time Round Island was probably a peninsula on the northern shore of the main island in the Isles of Scilly. The granite, ashlar, tall tower was designed by William Tregarthen Douglass, chief engineer for the Commissioners of Irish Lights, and is built on a tall mass of Hercynian granite. At the time of building the only access was up a flight of steps cut out of the rock on the south side of the island. Supplies were taken up the rock face by an aerial hoist: a wire rope strung between the island and an adjacent islet was rigged with a traveller, which enabled goods to be winched up from delivery boats below. Within the walls of the lighthouse the keepers tended a small vegetable garden, for which the soil was transported to the island. The light has a focal plane of 180 feet, and originally had an enormous biform hyperradial optic high and weighing more than 8 tons. It was built by Chance Brothers & Co of Birmingham and, said at the time, to be ‚Ä≥ .... in relation both to size and character .... the most remarkable works of their kind hitherto achieved.‚Ä≥ A similar optic had been installed in the nearby Bishop Rock Lighthouse the previous year. In order to differentiate the Round Island light from Bishop's Rock it was made to show a single red flash every 30 seconds (whereas Bishop's Rock gave a double white flash). At the centre of the optic was a pair of ten-wick Douglass oil burners (larger than the eight-wick burners installed at Bishop Rock); these unusually large lamps helped compensate for the reduced intensity caused by the light passing through red-tinted glass. Mineral oil for the lamps was stored in tanks, located at the south end of the island alongside the aerial host. The optic was turned by a small air engine placed in the pedestal; compressed air was provided from a set of compressors and tanks located in a separate engine house (a detached building to the south of the tower), powered by a pair of Davey 'Safety' Engines. In 1912 the lighthouse was provided with a fog siren, sounded through a pair of large red-painted Rayleigh Trumpets mounted on the roof of a fog horn house, adjacent to the lighthouse itself on the north side. It sounded four blasts every two minutes. The engine house was upgraded and equipped with a pair of 22 hp Hornsby oil engines which drove the compressor. These remained in service until the late 1960s, when they were replaced with diesel engines. Britain's first wireless beacon for navigation, designed for Trinity House by the Marconi Company, was established at Round Island Lighthouse in 1927, (following the trial run of an experimental system there two years earlier). The installation consisted of a 'multi-wire inverted L type aerial' strung between the lighthouse gallery and a steel lattice tower. It automatically transmitted a repeated cycle, including the station's unique call sign ('GGG' in Morse code), for nine minutes every half hour (or continuously in foggy weather). Similar systems were subsequently installed at lighthouses and other locations around the coast of Britain. In 1966 the light was electrified. The old hyperradial optic was replaced by a revolving flat panel with rows of sealed beam lamps, each covered by a red shade.Photo, 12 April 1969. A helicopter pad was built on the rock alongside the lighthouse in 1969, but boat deliveries also continued; the aerial hoist was upgraded in 1972. The optic was replaced again in 1987 when the light was automated and its colour changed from red to white, emitting one white flash every ten seconds; it had an intensity of 340,000 candela and a range of . Prior to automation, the siren was replaced with an electric nautophone signal. In 2002-3 the lighthouse was converted to solar power, with photovoltaic cells replacing the erstwhile constantly running diesel alternator sets as the power source for the light and fog signal. The lighthouse continues to display one white flash every ten seconds; the revolving drum optic has an intensity of 42,945 candela and a range of . The fog signal sounds four blasts every minute. Wildlife and ecology Round Island was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1995 as part of the Pentle Bay, Merrick and Round Islands SSSI. The island is important for its breeding seabirds, especially the European storm‚Äìpetrel (Hydrobates pelagicus). Breeding storm‚Äìpetrels were unrecorded on Round Island for many years, until one of the lighthouse keepers, mystified by the nightly appearance of black feathers in the living quarters, decided to keep some. When the identity of the bird was discovered, the cat was banished. The Seabird 2000 survey counted 183 occupied nests and a follow‚Äìup survey in 2006 found 251 occupied nests on the island; the second highest total in the Isles of Scilly. Puffins (Fratercula arctica) were first recorded as breeding on Round Island in 1850 by Issac North and during the building of the lighthouse it was said that ‚Ä≥They (puffins) were extremely tame and used to walk in and out of the kitchen of the workmen who built the tower. This tameness, and the edibility of their eggs, proved their undoing, for none survive now‚Ä≥. The seabird survey in 2000 also recorded 34 occupied nests of Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus). Permission is needed from Trinity House to land on the island and only two botanists are known to have visited. The first, J. E. Lousley, in 1957, only recorded the invasive Hottentot fig (Carpobrotus edulis). Thirty years later, in 1987, Rosemary Parslow found much of the ground between the buildings and the cliff edge was covered in a carpet of purple dewplant (Disphyma crassifolium) and Hottentot fig. She also recorded a small number of the expected coastal species. They were sea spleenwort (Asplenium marinum), bird's‚Äìfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), spear‚Äìleaved orache (Atriplex prostrata), sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima), rock sea spurrey (Spergularia rupicola), thrift (Armeria maritima) and tree mallow (Lavatera arborea). Gusts of winds can be ferocious such as in 1954 when there was continuous gales from 29 November to 16 December. Wind velocities of 177 km/h (110 mph) were recorded at the Bishop Rock where seas raced past the window, and on Round Island the wind gauge was destroyed at 177 km/h.

They are a large breed, with the female weighing between 700 and 750 kg (1,543 to 1,653 lb) and standing 1.40 m (4.6 feet) tall. They have a thick, mahogany red or black coat, and long, lyre-shaped, light-coloured horns. A small percentage is naturally born without horns (polled). In the 19th century, the breeder Ernest Tyssandier d'Escous set about to better the breed by selective breeding. Originally bred for work, this dual-purpose breed was especially appreciated for its ability to withstand extreme variations in temperature, its fertility, its ease of breeding, its milk (even if the presence of the calf was required to milk it), and its meat. In Cantal, the farmers practise mountain pasture, with the herd passing summer at altitude in the mountains. A female can produce almost 3,000 kg (6,614 lb) of fat-rich milk each year of her life. The milk is traditionally used to produce Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e cheese such as Cantal and Salers cheese. The Salers is also used to produce veal calves by cross-breeding with Charolais cattle. Currently, about 300,000 head of Salers are in France.

It stars Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Barry Pepper, and Jeremy Sisto as a group of men kidnapped and locked in a factory with no memory of how they arrived there. Piecing together information around them, they realize that some were kidnapped and some were the kidnappers. They decide they must work together to figure out how to get away before the gang that captured them returns. The film was previewed before a theater audience for the first time in New York City on December 13, 2005. Plot In a warehouse, a handful of men regain consciousness; they have no idea who they are or what happened to them. One is bound to a chair, another has been handcuffed and shot, a third has a broken nose, and the other two, one wearing a jean jacket and one wearing a rancher shirt, are also wounded. The man in the jean jacket wakes up first. He makes sure everyone is alive, then discovers that the windows are barred and the only door has a mechanized lock. He finds a ringing phone and picks it up. The caller asks what is going on and the jean jacket man tells the caller that everyone is fine. The caller tells him he will return in a few hours. Somewhere else, a money drop off is occurring. William Coles, Jr. has been kidnapped. In the warehouse, the bound asks to be untied. As the jean jacket man prepares to untie him, the man with the rancher shirt convinces him not to, telling him that the bound is not on the same side, or he would not have been tied up. As the jean jacket and rancher shirt men look for the keys to release the handcuffed man and treat his wound, the man with the broken nose wakes up and fights with them. At the drop off, the signal in the money bag goes silent; the cops enter to find the money gone. In the warehouse, the men find a newspaper featuring a story about the kidnapping of a wealthy businessman named Coles. The men suspect that they were involved with the kidnapping, but do not know what their involvement was. They begin to experience flashbacks. A gun is recovered, and the jean jacket man wins possession of it. Various attempts to free themselves, including trying to attract attention through a hole in the wall, and shooting out a window, fail. The men decide to work together to fight off the criminals who are coming, so all of them can go their separate ways. The handcuffed man recalls a harrowing incident from his childhood when he was comforted by his friend. He claims the jean jacket man is his friend, but the jean jacket man cannot verify this. The handcuffed man dies from his wounds. The police piece together who they believe the kidnappers are. They show photos of the suspects to Coles' wife Eliza. The handcuffed man, the bound man, and the jean jacket man are among the photos. At the warehouse, the gang returns from the money pickup. The bound man remembers he is part of the gang and tries warning them of the trap. In the confusion, he is shot along with one of the gang members. After the rancher shirt man is pushed out at gunpoint, the others surrender. The jean jacket man recalls that he is part of the gang, but cannot accept that he is a criminal. He is greeted by the snakeskin boots-wearing gang leader and chastised for letting things go so wrong in the warehouse. A fight broke out between kidnappers and victims. Chemicals spilled during the fight rendered everyone unconscious and induced temporary amnesia. The jean jacket man is tasked with killing the rancher shirt man and the broken nosed man, and tells them he has to kill them or be killed himself. After hearing gunshots near the grave that the bound man dug before losing his memory, the snakeskin boots leader asks the jean jacket man if he is looking at a cop. This sparks a memory that the jean jacket man was a cop working undercover in the gang. As the snakeskin boots leader looks over to see an empty grave, the broken nosed man comes out of the shadows to attack the gang members. The broken nosed man is killed, as are the remaining gang members. The rancher shirt man saves the jean jacket man's life by shooting the snakeskin boots leader, who has a gun leveled at the jean jacket man. The police arrive on the scene. The jean jacket man is praised for having survived so long undercover. The rancher shirt man turns out to be Coles, the wealthy businessman, and as both are being treated, Eliza arrives and hugs her husband. The jean jacket man looks over at the couple, and upon seeing the wife, remembers that they were having an affair. The jean jacket man arranged the kidnapping and planned to get rich and win Eliza. Horrified by what he has done, he takes the ransom money to the officers. Coles introduces his wife to the jean jacket man.

As of 2014, it served approximately 314 students. Academics are strongly oriented towards college preparatory with approximately 99% of the student body continuing to either a 2 or 4-year degree program. In addition to standard academics courses, student complete required religious education courses during each academic semester. History In 1882, a group of Presentation Sisters from Ireland, immigrated to Fargo, North Dakota and opened St. Joseph's Academy, the first Catholic school in Fargo. In 1897, the school was renamed Sacred Heart Academy and moved into a new building on North Broadway. Sacred Heart originally provided primary and secondary education. After the 1950 academic year, the school moved to a new building, and was renamed Shanley High School in honor of John Shanley, the first bishop of Fargo. Less than a decade after opening, the school was severely damaged by the 1957 Fargo tornado, an F5 tornado that destroyed much of north Fargo. Starting in 1964, the De LaSalle Christian Brothers began involvement with the school, acting as both administrators and teachers. Christian Brothers and Presentation Sisters would continue to work in the school until 1989. In 2001, construction began on the joint Shanley High School and Sullivan Middle School building. This $13.9 million project moved the school from its original location in north Fargo to an 80-acre site in south Fargo shared with Sts. Anne & Joachim Catholic Church. The final academic year in the original building completed in May 2002. In the fall of 2010, Shanley High School completed construction and expansion of existing activities facilities along with the creation of a multi-purpose football and soccer field named \\"Sid Cichy Stadium\\" in honor of one of the program's former coaches. The project includes plans for a baseball field as well as track and field facilities. Activities =Athletics= Throughout the 1950s to 1970s, Shanley's football team rose to prominence under head coach Sid Cichy. Throughout his tenure (1948-1977) the team won 16 state titles and completed 11 undefeated seasons. At one time the Deacons held the record for longest consecutive unbeaten streak in the country, having won 59 games in a row. In 2009, Shanley was reclassed to \\"AA\\", the second level of North Dakota's four- class football system. Shanley also has shown its ability to produce NFL talent as of late. North Dakota State Championships =Choral department= Shanley is home to a large choral program with two choirs, the Concert Chorale and the Varsity Choir, both directed by Patrick McGuire. Members of the choir are also able to participate in numerous music festivals and competitions. In the fall of 2005, Shanley's Concert Chorale was given the designation of \\"Governor's Choir\\" for the state of North Dakota. =Faith and service activities= Deacon Day Deacon Day is Shanley High School's annual day of service. This generally occurs in the fall during the school's homecoming week and stands as a strong marker of Shanley's commitment to Catholic social teachings. Faculty and staff members lead groups of students as they serve at a variety of locations in the Fargo-Moorhead community. All Shanley students participate in this day of community service. In the past, students have served at homeless shelters, food banks, churches, schools, parks, and other non-profits in the area. September 24, 2014 marked the 16th annual Deacon Day. Students for Life For years Shanley High School has had a strong and active Teens for Life group. Due to their substantial pro- life activism, the Students for Life of America Conference named Shanley's Teens for Life group the National Pro-Life High School Group of the year in 2013. Shanley was honored again in 2014 when the National March-for-Life Committee selected Shanley to carry the lead banner in the 2015 National March-for-Life in Washington, DC. Shanley High School plans to have the entire student body march in the 2015 March-for-Life.

Only 83 cm (2 feet, 9 inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first to be listed in the Guinness World Records as the shortest adult in a leading role. Born in Baclaran, Para√±aque with a primordial dwarfism condition, dela Cruz started exercising and studied karate. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by film producers Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions, and got the pseudonym Weng Weng. Following this, dela Cruz played supporting roles in films, and shared his first top billing with Ramon Zamora in Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa (1978). Dela Cruz's first lead in the action film spoof Agent OO (1981) was followed by two sequels. It became dela Cruz's most well known role, where he demonstrated skills in stunts and martial arts. Agent OO's sequel For Your Height Only (1981) turned dela Cruz in an international star and gave him the notoriety to become a unique figure in cinema. After its local release, first lady Imelda Marcos organised a lavish film festival in the hope to present Filipino films to foreign distributor. At the event, For Your Height Only outsold every other film on foreign sales, while dela Cruz was the mediatic center of attention and the breakthrough celebrity. In the Philippines it is still their highest exported film, and within their acting community dela Cruz's international reach hasn't been topped. Following his success, dela Cruz appeared in three more films D'Wild Wild Weng (1982), The Impossible Kid (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny alongside Berting Labra and Pia Moran. Eventually, Peter and Cora Caballes changed professional paths and dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry. Dela Cruz spent the rest of his life with his family in Baclaran and died at the age of 34 in 1992. With the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon. Online, some of his movies and clips of them went viral. By the 2000s, a lot of information published about him was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful documentaries Machete Maidens Unleashed! (2010), and The Search for Weng Weng (2013).  Early life  Dela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz, an electrician (1914‚Äì1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz, a laundry woman (1919‚Äì1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as follows. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor informed her, and when she gave birth, his size was ‚Äúno bigger than a small coke bottle‚Äù. His premature state forced dela Cruz‚Äôs parents to place him in a shoe box under a light as a rudimentary incubator, feeding him with dropper. With a medical condition known as primordial dwarfism, it caused dela Cruz to reach the height of only 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meters) tall. Being devout Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as Santo Ni√±o each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor. By 1968, dela Cruz's father died after falling down a ladder at work. According to Celing, as a child dela Cruz was fascinated with action films and started to study them. Neighbours of dela Cruz began to notice him climbing on clothing lines doing acrobatics and pull ups. Dela Cruz joined Karate classes, where he learned quickly, and impressed his instructor, so much so that the instructor would perform demonstrations with dela Cruz to promote the school. During one of these demonstrations, dela Cruz was noticed by producer and actor Peter Caballes of Liliw Productions. Dela Cruz's mother who had a hard time raising five boys, allowed Peter and his wife Cora Ridon Caballes to take dela Cruz under their helm for a film career.  Career  = 1975 to 1981: Early roles and breakthrough = Dela Cruz began to work almost exclusively with Liliw Productions. He began with an uncredited role in Silakbo, released October 17, 1975. In 1976, dela Cruz received his first billing as Weng Weng, which would be his pseudonym for the rest of his career, when he co-starred in Silang Matatapang and Sila...Sa Bawat Bangketa. In 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with actor Ramon Zamora in Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa. Comic actor Rodolfo Vera Quizon Sr., better known as Dolphy, was friends with Peter Caballes, who introduced him to dela Cruz. Quizon felt he could use dela Cruz in a comedy film and hired him to act for his company RVQ Productions. Their first collaboration was the spy-spoof film The Quick Brown Fox. Dela Cruz played Quizon's sidekick. The movie was released on November 6,1980. On February 13 1981, Stariray premiered. It's Dolphy's comedy vehicle and dela Cruz plays a supporting role. On May 29, Agent 00 was released. In it dela Cruz plays the lead as the character Agent OO. To prepare him for the role, director Eddie Nicart, an accomplished actor and stuntman who would direct all of dela Cruz's leading roles from that point on, gave him the same training he received with the SOS Daredevils, a stuntman training company. As well as taking care of dela Cruz's training for the rest of his career, Nicart also expanded his training in karate and acting. Nicart doubted dela Cruz's suitability for the role due to his intellectual and physical limitations, but changed his mind when he realized how collaborative and brave dela Cruz could be. On June 12, Da Best In Da West was released. Another comedy starring Dolphy with dela Cruz in a minor role. On the 2nd of July, Legs... Katawan... Babae! premiered. It's a musical film vehicle for the disco group Hagibis, dela Cruz appears in a musical number. For Your Height Only was released on September 2. The film would turn dela Cruz into a legend. In it he returned as secret Agent OO. The film was a hit and at Imelda Marcos' first Manila International Film Festival, where he became a global sensation. Filipino filmmakers saw it as a real opportunity to showcase their talents; however, dela Cruz became the center of attention by making daily appearances demonstrating stunts, martial arts, and exercises. For Your Height Only outsold every other film at the festival for international distribution. Film distributor Tony Maharaj, who bought the film for the West Indies, said the film opened at number one on the same day as Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark and remained there for two weeks. Filipino film historians Teddy Co and Ed Lejano, as well as Marcos' daughter Imee said dela Cruz's success shattered every other participant's artistic aspirations. According to director Eddie Nicart, a short-lived Weng Weng craze followed in the Philippines. = 1982 to 1986: action film star = On March 25, 1982, D'Wild Wild Weng was released. In the film is dela Cruz is paired with Max Alvarado, they play a duo who are sent to the countryside to investigate the murder a mayor and his family. On July 23, The Impossible Kid premiered, with dela Cruz returning in the role of Agent OO. The character now works for the Manila branch of Interpol. On December 25, dela Cruz shared the top billing with Berting Labra and Pia Moran in The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny. Between the time of his breakthrough and 1985, dela Cruz was announced as one of the supporting actors in another action film by Liliw Production Tatak: Magnum (1983) starring local actor Nelson Anderson who at the time was under a contract with them. It is unknown if dela Cruz filmed any scenes for the film, since he is not in the finished product. At the time, Anderson said he and dela Cruz were in talks for two projects. First the production house received the photos of a then-unknown Jean-Claude Van Damme, and were creating a film where Van Damme would have acted with both of them. After introducing dela Cruz Italian neorealist films, they planned to make a dramatic characters based action comedy remake of Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Both director Bobby A. Suarez and actress Marrie Lee said they were working with dela Cruz on a project that never materialized. According to Suarez, dela Cruz would have played his own version of Superman. According to both Eddie Nicart and Celing, dela Cruz worked at as an agent at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, where he would mostly be there to welcome foreigners, due to Cora Caballes' friendship with the head of the airport. Dela was authorised to carry a gun Fidel V. Ramos dela Cruz, who at the time was chief-of-staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In January or February 1986, dela Cruz appeared at a Ferdinand Marcos' reelection rally showing support. Around that time, dela Cruz received a trophy from the Starlight Cultural Foundation - Pasig Cultural Affair for International Action Star of Showbiz World. The trophy is dated on February 22; afterward no public appearance by dela Cruz is known. = 1987 to 1992: return to obscurity and death = Peter and Cora Caballes retired from filmmaking circa 1987, and dela Cruz returned to his hometown and lived in poverty, under the care of his mother and brother Danny. Celing dela Cruz, said that Weng Weng impostor appeared on TV even after his death. Circa 1990, dela Cruz had a stroke which left him invalid, with half of his body paralyzed until his passing in 1992. = 1993 to present day: posthumous success and aftermath = Internationally, Weng Weng films became a rare treat on video cassette among cult film aficionados. In the mid 2000s, with the arrival of the Internet and YouTube, various clips and films in their entirety starring dela Cruz were uploaded. Gradually, he found a new audience as a cult film star. At the time dela Cruz's life was vague, while some elements of it had a base in reality, most of what was written about him was myth. Around this time director Andrew Leavold started to make a documentary to discover his life behind the Weng Weng label. The discoveries about him led to two theatrically released documentaries. First it inspired Mark Hartley's Machete Maidens Unleashed! (2010) which focuses on the history of films made in the Philippines during dela Cruz's active years, and had a segment dedicated to him. The second one about his life, The Search for Weng Weng (2013), was directed by Leavold, who also followed it up with a book by the same name, some of which details that didn't make the final cut or discovered later. Both films were prominent on festival circuits and critically acclaimed. Research made showed that dela Cruz's films are likely lost, partly lost, poorly preserved or in storage. Lost Weng Weng movies are Agent OO and The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny. Both sequels of Agent OO as well as D'Wild Wild Weng are partially lost, since the original Tagalog language audio tracks were never found. The U-matic master tape of ABS-CBN Dolphy's The Quick Brown Fox disintegrated upon its last screening at their facilities. Death On August 29, 1992, Ernesto dela Cruz, age 34, died in Pasay City, of a heart attack. As described by his brother on that morning dela Cruz, who was already bed stricken due to a previous heart attack, fell from his bed and was found unconscious. Dela Cruz was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The official cause is heart attack due to hypertension.  Personal  Celing and Filipino actor Franco Guerrero said that dela Cruz never had any romantic relationships. Guerrero said that dela Cruz said he would brag about sexual exploits but never saw his actual girlfriends. Director Dante Pangilinan said that dela Cruz had his first kiss on the set of Sila... Sa bawat bangketa (1977) after he asked him if he could get an onscreen kiss. When he said yes, dela Cruz was both delighted and nervous. Yehlen Catral, who played the damsel-in-distress in a dela Cruz film, said she helped him introduce himself to women. According to director Eddie Nicart if dela Cruz would get free from the set, he would immediately go where there is drinks and women, and would consistently ask their whereabouts. Celing and Nicart said that dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Actors Rez Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and had adult conversations with him, but had an odd sense of humor, and thinks it is probably what led others to believe he was slow. Actor Nelson Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side to his talent. Producer Peter and Cora Caballes were married when they discovered dela Cruz. During dela Cruz's prime, their account was that they adopted him ten years prior to the release of For Your Height Only (1981) to help him. In 1982 they released their last film with dela Cruz. According to both Nicart and film distributor John Kater, the couple separated. Peter left Manilla and Cora ran successfully as a city councilor. Celing denies Peter and Cora Caballes' adoption account and said they just borrowed dela Cruz when needed, as if he would go on a holiday with them. Celing describes the couple as civil when visiting, but only dealt with their mother on business issues and promised her a house. Celing added that they never provided it or fully pay his brother, they abandoned him when they had a career change, and completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed. At dela Cruz's funeral Celing said that Peter paid for the casket paid and sent a minor amount of cash, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother. On dela Cruz's work conditions, his contemporaries Rez Cortez, Nelson Anderson, Roland Dantes, Franco Guerrero, Rusty Santos, and his director Eddie Nicard found his financial treatment appalling. For dela Cruz, Nicart said the Caballes provided shelter, care, travelled the world, while underpaid at $500 per films with a per diem. Nicart said the Caballes were wealthy and treated dela Cruz like a dog. They would be friendly to him, but would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting or when inconvenient. On that matter, Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like a puppet by everyone and the Caballes were too possessive not allowing him to grow and think for himself. Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing, he suspected that dela Cruz wasn't well compensated. Cortez knew dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, but found it strange when he saw dela Cruz arrive on set in a utility vehicle and not his private car. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences. Film editor Edgardo \\"Boy\\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince. According to the filmmakers of the documentary The Search for Weng Weng, when they tracked down the couple to get their account, Peter had died in 2007 while Cora never responded on the matter. On dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, a former actor and stuntman, had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film due to his limitations and also his inability to read a script. Prior to the shoot of their first film Agent OO (1981) and for the rest of dela Cruz's career Nicart trained him with the stunt company SOS Daredevils. To further dela Cruz's abilities, they gave him acting, karate, fight choreography, and stunts lessons. Nicart found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, Dolphy praised his sense of humor and physical skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities. Dela Cruz had several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around who did not know what to make him, and when dela Cruz spoke the little girls got scared. He found dela Cruz hilarious. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along. Anderson's account of his friendship with dela Cruz was at the time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. He said it was polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed his potential and felt he was put down by others. He recalls bringing dela Cruz at an Art house cinema to introduce him to Italian neorealist films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched Luis Bu√±uel's Los Olvidados (1950), Federico Fellini's La Strada (1954), and Fran√ßois Truffaut's The 400 Blows (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948), on his first viewing he cried. They agreed to make an action-comedy remake with a human touch. Anderson also talked about dela Cruz's fearlessness. When he gave dela Cruz a ride on his motorcycle, dela Cruz was upset when he asked him to wear a belt and a helmet. He also recalls that a man once tapped his hand on dela Cruz's head, who stood up for himself. It led to a situation where Anderson had to separate them. Shortly after Anderson voiced concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, they separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see dela Cruz again. Catral stated that when she stopped acting that he and Dolphy were among the few she said goodbye to. Celing said that fellow actress Lotis Key attended dela Cruz's funeral. Dela Cruz became a Marcos family's friends. President Ferdinand Marcos gave dela Cruz the title of agent. Dela Cruz endorsed Marcos for his 1986 reelection, and dela Cruz last known appearance was at one of his rally. According to director Dante Pangilinan, dela Cruz got to know them because Cora Caballes is the niece of General Prospero Olivas. According to Marcos' daughter Imee the whole family fell in love with him because dela Cruz's personal sense of humor was infectious. She went on to say that it was with her brother Bongbong with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady Imelda Marcos said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy. What a talent, to have almost nothing and then to make people happy, I salute.  Martial arts, stunt work, and fitness  Family and neighbors of dela Cruz said he started training on his own at a young age, doing push ups, pull ups, and climbing on clothing lines to do acrobacies. Inspired by action films, he started training Karate which he maintained throughout his career. Some account say that for his size he was an impressive weight lighter and enjoyed parachuting. Prior to the release of Agent OO (1981) director Eddie Nicart's account, who was an accomplished stuntmen and martial artist took over for his training with the stuntmen organisation SOS Daredevils. It was told to him that dela Cruz was a black belt in Karate, he didn't believe it. He credited dela Cruz to have some skills but not on the level to be a leading men. With Nicart, dela Cruz had to restart back from white to black belt by their standards, while teaching him stunts. Nicart observed that even being mentally slow dela Cruz learnt quick because of his was cooperativeness. He concluded that dela Cruz became a real black belt in Karate with them and a first-rate stuntman who performed all of his own stunts fearlessly.  Legacy  Dela Cruz is Philippines‚Äô first international celebrity. First Lady Imelda Marcos who invested a lot of resources in Filipino Cinema, organized the first Manila International Film Festivals to promote the local productions to the rest of the world. Dela Cruz became the mediatic center of attention, making one appearance a day at the festival performing stunts, with exercise and Martial Arts demonstrations. This led for his film For Your Height Only to outsell every other local film by a very large margin and made and to this day is Philippines cinema's most exported film. At the time, dela Cruz success was awkward in Philippines' film industry, that the Weng Weng image was uncomfortable since they had no other international figures. However directors Bobby A. Suarez and Tikoy Aguiluz felt that dela Cruz's success was glorious. Suarez said it made him very happy since it left the right people upset. Aguiluz went on to say he is our middle finger to Hollywood. In is home town of Baclaran, Para√±aque, neighbors of dela Cruz said that when putting aside his sad story his success bring them pride. While dela Cruz returned to obscurity in his home country, but worldwide cult films affectionadoes collected VHS copies of his films, and eventually uploaded them on the internet to become viral. This new audience appreciated the comical nature of dela Cruz's films, and were impressed with his talent in stunts and martial arts. With little information published on dela Cruz, rumors about his origins became folklore. Renewed interest on dela Cruz's led to two critically acclaimed documentaries. In 2010, Mark Hartley's Machete Maidens Unleashed! a documentary film that dealt with the Filipino movie exploitation craze of the 1970s and 1980s, paid a special homage to dela Cruz's movie career. The basis of the first film was the 2007 rough cut of Andrew Leavolds's The Search for Weng Weng released in 2013, about discovering dela Cruz's life.  Legend  Dela Cruz is rumored to have been a comedian, a dentistry student, customs officer, to have live bestselling bootleg recording of him singing Frank Sinatra's \\"My Way\\" with former first lady Imelda Marcos, and real life secret agent. According to Eddie Nicart, his friendship with the presidential family led President Marcos to give dela Cruz an official title of secret agent. Marcos offered him a senorita pocket pistol, which he carried on. Both Eddie Nicart and Celing said former chief-of-staff of the Armed Forces and future president Fidel V. Ramos gave work to dela Cruz at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, where he would mostly be there to welcome foreigners with the job title of agent. They said Ramos also authorised dela Cruz to carry a gun. Actor Eddie Garcia and director Eddie Nicart said that dela Cruz helped the police several times, where they would put him through vents or tight areas so that he would open the front door for them. Garcia precised that it was for the Philippine Constabulary. According to Ceiling the family accepted dela Cruz's size due to their mother's fascination with the image of Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫. Furthermore, Ceiling said that dela Cruz was dressed as the Saint for their yearly festivals, church plays, and that a lot of people believed he was a living version of him. Film director Peque Gallaga said he saw dela Cruz in full costume at the parade, and was involved in a laying of hands with supposedly healing powers. Some neighbors of dela Cruz believe there was a magical side and said dela Cruz was a healer and would visit him when sick or wounded and ask to him pray for their recovery. Both his common collaborators, actor Dolphy and director Dante Pangilinan, said dela Cruz had an energy connected with luck. Pangilinan, whose early films have dela Cruz in the cast, said that he believes that it was dela Cruz's touch of good fortune gave him a bigger break as a director, luck, and personal growth.

It was created by Australian scientist Dr Christine Charles, based on a technology invented by Professor Rod Boswell, both of the Australian National University. The design has been verified by the ESA, which is participating in its development. Theory of operation A helicon double-layer thruster (HDLT) is a type of plasma thruster, which ejects high velocity ionized gas to provide thrust to a spacecraft. In this thruster design, gas is injected into a tubular chamber (the source tube) with one open end. Radio frequency AC power (at 13.56 MHz in the prototype design) is coupled into a specially shaped antenna wrapped around the chamber. The electromagnetic wave emitted by the antenna causes the gas to break down and form a plasma. The antenna then excites a helicon wave in the plasma, which further heats the plasma. The device has a roughly constant magnetic field in the source tube (supplied by solenoids in the prototype), but the magnetic field diverges and rapidly decreases in magnitude away from the source region, and might be thought of as a kind of magnetic nozzle. In operation, there is a sharp boundary between the high density plasma inside the source region, and the low density plasma in the exhaust, which is associated with a sharp change in electrical potential. The plasma properties change rapidly across this boundary, which is known as a current-free electric double layer. The electrical potential is much higher inside the source region than in the exhaust, and this serves both to confine most of the electrons, and to accelerate the ions away from the source region. Enough electrons escape the source region to ensure that the plasma in the exhaust is neutral overall. Like most ion propulsion devices, the HDLT is a low thrust, high specific impulse (Isp) thruster. A prototype 15 cm diameter thruster, operated in low-magnetic field mode, underwent initial thrust testing in 2010, however, a more complete testing method would be necessary to properly calculate the total thrust. Currently, the final thruster prototype is undergoing tests at the space simulation facility dubbed \\"Wombat XL\\" located at the Australian National University (ANU) Mount Stromlo Observatory. The HDLT has two main advantages over most other ion thruster designs; first, it creates an accelerating electric field without inserting unreliable components like high voltage grids into the plasma (the only plasma-facing component is the robust plasma vessel). Secondly, a neutralizer isn't needed, since there are equal numbers of electrons and (singly charged) positive ions emitted. So, with neither moving mechanical parts nor susceptibility to erosion, Dr Charles explains, 'As long as you provide the power and the propellant you can go forever.' Applications The primary application for this thruster design is intended for satellite station-keeping, long term LEO to GEO orbit transfers and deep space applications. While a typical design could provide a 50-year life span, or a saving of 1000 lb (‚âà454 kg) of launch weight for large satellites, this type of thruster could also significantly reduce the length of interplanetary space trips. For example, a trip to Mars could be shortened to 3 months instead of the 8 to 9 months with conventional chemical rockets.

The population is diverse, having a large Christian religious base, being mostly Maronite Catholics and Greek Orthodox, while also having a large Muslim group of both the Shia and Sunni branches of Islam, which also includes a large non-religious minority. (Christians are in the majority in the diaspora of Lebanese people worldwide, which is estimated as 8‚Äì14 million people, and much larger than the total population of Lebanon itself.) Lebanon, in both its modern-day form as the Lebanese state (declared 1920; independent 1943), and its historical form as the region of the Lebanon, has been a source of migrants to Australia since the 1870s. 230,880 Australians (about 1% of the total population) claimed some Lebanese ancestry in 2016. The 2016 census reported 76,450 Lebanese-born people in Australia, with nearly 66,000 of those resident in Greater Sydney. The term Leb or Lebo, is (sometimes derogatorily) used to refer to people of Lebanese ethnicity, or more broadly, anyone of Middle-Eastern appearance, especially in the Sydney area. Diaspora history =19th-century migration= As part of a large scale emigration in the 1870s, numerous Lebanese (specifically Lebanese Christians fleeing Ottoman persecution) migrated in great numbers out of Lebanon to various destinations. Most emigrated to The United Kingdom, Brazil, Argentina and other Latin American nations, particularly Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. Many also went to the United States, Canada, and others to Australia, primarily to the eastern states, and most to New South Wales in particular. In the 1890s, there were increasing numbers of Lebanese immigrants to Australia, part of the mass emigration from the area of the Lebanon that would become the modern Lebanese state, and also from the Anti-Lebanon mountains region of what would become Syria. =White Australia policy= Under the White Australia policy of the late nineteenth century (and with Lebanon being located in the Middle East, geographically known as South West Asia) Lebanese migrants were classified as Asians and came within the scope of the so-called White Australia policy, which intentionally restricted non-white immigration to Australia. Lebanese migrants, like others deemed non-white by various colony laws from 1875‚Äì1888, were excluded from citizenship, the right to vote and employment, and were treated as enemy aliens during World War I and World War II. In 1897 Lebanese store keepers and businesses were accused of fraud by state border Customs officers during Queensland customs prosecution cases. Prior to 1918, Lebanese immigrants to Australia were not habitually distinguished from Turks because the area of modern Lebanon was a province of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. Administration then passed to the French Mandate for several decades, which ruled it together with what would become Syria, its neighbour. Hence, for that period, the Lebanese were not distinguished from Syrians.This was a common enough practice in Australian immigration information ‚Äì for example, the UK and Ireland were not statistically separated until as late as 1996). People with Lebanese ancestry as a percentage of the population in Sydney divided geographically by postal area, as of the 2011 census One dot denotes 100 Lebanese-born Melbourne residents From 1920, people from Lebanon (and Syria) were granted access to Australian citizenship as the Nationality Act 1920 removed the racial disqualification from the naturalisation laws. By 1947, there were 2000 Lebanese-born in Australia, almost all Christian. =Second wave of migration= The Lebanese-born population numbered 5000 in 1971. Following the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975-1990, this wave of migrants were often poor and for the first time, over half of them were Muslim. This influx of new migrants changed the character of the established Lebanese community in Australia significantly, especially in Sydney where 70% of the Lebanese-born population were concentrated. Christian Maronite and Orthodox Lebanese Christians that settled in Australia over the last two centuries were able to gain some influence within Australian politics. In late 1975, unrest in Lebanon caused a group of influential Maronite Australians to approach Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and his immigration minister, Michael MacKellar regarding the resettling of Lebanese civilians with their Australian relatives. Immediate access to Australia could not be granted under normal immigration categories, thus the Lebanese people were categorised as refugees. This was not in the traditional sense as the Lebanese people were not fleeing from persecution but escaping from internal conflict between Muslim and Christian groups. This action was known as the \\"Lebanon Concession\\".http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/community-under- siege/1970s-lebanese-commission-led-to-an-immigration-debacle/news- story/0d504285023bc42b79c70b3b70f93c2e Between 1975-1990, more than 30,000 civil war refugees arrived in Australia. Most immigrants were Muslim Lebanese from deprived rural areas who learned of Australia's Lebanon Concession and decided to seek a better life. They were Sunnis from northern Lebanon and Shias from southern Lebanon as Christian and Muslim Lebanese were unwilling to leave the capital city, Beirut. Immigrants of the Lebanese Concession primarily settled in south-west Sydney; Sunnis in Lakemba and Shias in Arncliffe. =21st century= Following the trials for a series of gang rape attacks in Sydney in 2000 by a group of Lebanese Muslims, the Lebanese Muslim Australian community came under significant scrutiny by the tabloid media and \\"Shock jocks\\", in addition to a more general anti-Muslim backlash after the 11 September attacks in 2001. Community concern and divisiveness continued in the wake of the 2005 Cronulla riots in Sydney, in which an altercation between some youths of Middle Eastern appearance and local surf livesavers blew up into a full-blown racially-motivated riot the following weekend, helped along by tabloid journalism and shock jocks. In November 2016, Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton said that it was a mistake of a previous Liberal administration to have brought out Lebanese Muslim immigrants. Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop said Dutton was making a specific point about those charged with terrorism offences, but Dutton was criticised for his comments in the media by politicians, terrorism experts and others. =Return migration= Lebanese Australians have a moderate rate of return migration to Lebanon. In December 2001, the Department of Foreign Affairs estimated that there were 30,000 Australian citizen residents in Lebanon. During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, the Australian Government organised mass evacuations of Australian residents in Lebanon. Demographics Worldwide, most people of Lebanese ancestry today live outside Lebanon, and are known as the Lebanese diaspora which numbers from 8Bassil promises to ease citizenship for expatriates to possibly 14 million. =Locations= In New South Wales, most Lebanese Australians were reported to reside in the Western Sydney council areas of City of Bankstown, with City of Holroyd, City of Canterbury and City of Parramatta (all pre-2016 council areas). The area included suburbs such as Lakemba, Greenacre and Punchbowl. In Victoria, like most Middle-Easterners, Lebanese Australians are mostly found in the Northern Melbourne council areas such as the City of Moreland and the City of Hume, particularly in neighbourhoods such as Broadmeadows, Coburg, and Brunswick. =Religious diversity= All main Lebanese religious groups ‚Äì Christians, including Maronites, Melkites, Greek Orthodox, Protestants, Muslims, including Shia, Sunnis and Druze were represented in Australia in 2006. According to the , 48.81% of Australians with Lebanese ancestry were Christians, 39.88% were Muslims, and 6.00% followed secular or no religious beliefs.Data Source: Census of Population and Housing, 2016, TableBuilder Business Lebanese in Sydney have followed a distinctive occupational pattern characterised by high levels of self-employment, particularly in petty commercial activities such as hawking and shopkeeping. In 1901, '80 per cent of Lebanese in NSW were concentrated in commercial occupations' ‚Äì in 1947, little had changed, as 60 per cent of Lebanese were 'either employers or self-employed'. Even in the 1991 census, Lebanese men and women were 'noticeably over-represented as self- employed'. The Lebanese in Melbourne have opened restaurants and groceries and Middle Eastern shops and Lebanese bars on Sydney Road which is sometimes called \\"Little Lebanon\\". The peak business body is the Australian Lebanese Chamber of Commerce, with associations in both Sydney and Melbourne. Arts, culture, terminology In 2014, a series of documentaries on Lebanese Australians was presented by SBS under the title Once Upon a Time in Punchbowl.Once Upon a Time in Punchbowl at SBS On Demand, 3 July 2014. Retrieved 7 July 2014 The Lebanese Film Festival was launched in Sydney in 2012. Every year since then, it has showcases films which are either filmed or based in Lebanon, or made by Lebanese film makers throughout the world. The organisation is based in Bankstown, but the film festival travels to cinemas in Newcastle and Bowral in NSW, as well as Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Brisbane from August to November each year. In 2017‚Äì8, two seasons of the sitcom Here Come the Habibs, featuring a Lebanese Australian family who win the lottery and move to the posh eastern suburbs of Sydney, aired on Channel 9. Michael Mohammed Ahmad's 2018 comic novel The Lebs was shortlisted for the 2019 Miles Franklin Award. He had previously written an essay entitled \\"Lebs and Punchbowl Prison\\", the prison referring to his alma mater, Punchbowl Boys' High School. At his school, the term \\"Lebs\\" did not refer just to boys from Lebanese family, but to anyone whose family came from the Middle East, and even included boys with African and Indonesian backgrounds. The term \\"Leb\\" or \\"Lebo\\" has been used as a derogatory term, mostly in Sydney, and gained more widespread use after the 2005 Cronulla Riots. It is listed in the Collins English Dictionary as \\"Australian (offensive, slang), a person from Lebanon or of Lebanese origin\\". Ahmad wishes to help reclaim the word through his writing.

Johnson was a three-time All Star and won Grey Cups with Calgary in 1992, 1998 and 2001. He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2009. Johnson first became a Stampeder back in 1991, playing the next 13 seasons as what many referred to as the 'heart of the Stampeder defence'. After being granted free agency in February 1991 from the B.C. Lions, Johnson signed with the Stampeders the same month and spent 13 years with the Stamps, winning three Grey Cup championship rings (1992, 1998, and 2001) and playing in three other Grey Cup finals. From his linebacker spot, he finished with 1,095 tackles (second all-time in CFL history) and 83 special teams tackles for a grand total of 1,178 in 248 games. Johnson also had 45 quarterback sacks for 333 yards, 43 tackles for a total loss of 113 yards, 16 fumble recoveries with three for touchdowns, eight forced fumbles, 17 interceptions (one for a TD), and 10 pass knockdowns. In 19 post-season games, Johnson registered 83 tackles and seven special team tackles for a total of 90, two QB sacks for 22 yards, seven tackles for a loss of eight yards, two interceptions, one forced fumble, and one pass knockdown. In six Grey Cups, Johnson had 27 total tackles, a Grey Cup record, with one quarterback sack for 13 yards in the 2001 game and two tackles for loss in the 1991 final. In the 1998 Grey Cup victory, 26-24 over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, he set the CFL record for the most defensive tackles in a Grey Cup game with eight. That 1998 season a total of 87 tackles spurred him to the Norm Freidgate Trophy as the Most Outstanding Defensive Player in the West Division, as well as being named a West Division and CFL All-Star. He was also a CFL All-Star in 1995, 1998 and 2000, a West Division All-Star also in 1991, 1992, 1997, 1998 and 2000, and a North All- Star in 1995. Johnson was also the first CFL player to score on a two-point conversion in 1989.

Brook, developed at Stanford University graphics group, was a compiler and runtime implementation of a stream programming language targeting modern, highly parallel GPUs such as those found on ATI or Nvidia graphics cards. BrookGPU compiled programs written using the Brook stream programming language, which is a variant of ANSI C. It could target OpenGL v1.3+, DirectX v9+ or AMD's Close to Metal for the computational backend and ran on both Microsoft Windows and Linux. For debugging, BrookGPU could also simulate a virtual graphics card on the CPU. Status Brook has been in beta for a long time. The last major beta release (v0.4) was in October 2004 but renewed development began and stopped again in November 2007 with a v0.5 beta 1 release. The new features of v0.5 include a much upgraded and faster OpenGL backend which uses framebuffer objects instead of PBuffers and harmonised the code around standard OpenGL interfaces instead of using proprietary vendor extensions. GLSL support was added which brings all the functionality (complex branching and loops) previously only supported by DirectX 9 to OpenGL. In particular, this means that Brook is now just as capable on Linux as Windows. Other improvements in the v0.5 series include multi-backend usage whereby different threads can run different Brook programs concurrently (thus maximising use of a multi-GPU setup) and SSE and OpenMP support for the CPU backend (this allows near maximal usage of modern CPUs). Performance comparison A like for like comparison between desktop CPUs and GPGPUs is problematic because of algorithmic & structural differences. For example, a 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo can perform a maximum of 25 GFLOPs (25 billion single-precision floating-point operations per second) if optimally using SSE and streaming memory access so the prefetcher works perfectly. However, traditionally (due to shader program length limits) most GPGPU kernels tend to perform relatively small amounts of work on large amounts of data in parallel, so the big problem with directly executing GPGPU algorithms on desktop CPUs is vastly lower memory bandwidth as generally speaking the CPU spends most of its time waiting on RAM. As an example, dual-channel PC2-6400 DDR2 RAM can throughput about 11 Gbit/s which is around 1.5 GFLOPs maximum given that there is a total of 3 GFLOPs total bandwidth and one must both read and write. As a result, if memory bandwidth constrained, Brook's CPU backend won't exceed 2 GFLOPs. In practice, it's even lower than that most especially for anything other than float4 which is the only data type which can be SSE accelerated. On an ATI HD 2900 XT (740 MHz core 1000 MHz memory), Brook can perform a maximum of 410 GFLOPs via its DirectX 9 backend. OpenGL is currently (due to driver and Cg compiler limitations) much less efficient as a GPGPU backend on that GPU, so Brook can only manage 210 GFLOPs when using OpenGL on that GPU. On paper, this looks like around twenty times faster than the CPU, but as just explained it isn't as easy as that. GPUs currently have major branch and read/write access penalties so expect a reasonable maximum of one third of the peak maximum in real world code - this still leaves that ATI card at around 125 GFLOPs some five times faster than the Intel Core 2 Duo. However this discounts the important part of transferring the data to be processed to and from the GPU. With a PCI Express 1.0 x8 interface, the memory of an ATI HD 2900 XT can be written to at about 730 Mbit/s and read from at about 311 Mbit/s which is significantly slower than normal PC memory. For large datasets, this can greatly diminish the speed increase of using a GPU over a well-tuned CPU implementation. Of course, as GPUs become faster far more quickly than CPUs and the PCI Express interface improves, it will make more sense to offload large processing to GPUs.

There are numerous measures available to prevent cyberattacks. Cybersecurity measures include firewalls, anti-virus software, intrusion detection and prevention systems, encryption, and login passwords. There have been attempts to improve cybersecurity through regulation and collaborative efforts between the government and the private sector to encourage voluntary improvements to cybersecurity. Tensions between domestic law enforcement efforts to conduct cross-border cyber-exfiltration operations and international jurisdiction are likely to continue to provide improved cybersecurity norms. Industry regulators, including banking regulators, have taken notice of the risk from cybersecurity and have either begun or planned to begin to include cybersecurity as an aspect of regulatory examinations. Background In 2011 the DoD released a guidance called the Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace which articulated five goals: to treat cyberspace as an operational domain, to employ new defensive concepts to protect DoD networks and systems, to partner with other agencies and the private sector in pursuit of a \\"whole-of-government cybersecurity Strategy\\", to work with international allies in support of collective cybersecurity and to support the development of a cyber workforce capable of rapid technological innovation. A March 2011 GAO report \\"identified protecting the federal government's information systems and the nation's cyber critical infrastructure as a governmentwide high-risk area\\" noting that federal information security had been designated a high-risk area since 1997. As of 2003 systems protecting critical infrastructure, called cyber critical infrastructure protection of cyber CIP have also been included. In November 2013, the DoD put forward the new cybersecurity rule (78 Fed. Reg. 69373), which imposed certain requirements on contractors: compliance with certain NIST IT standards, mandatory reporting of cybersecurity incidents to the DoD, and a \\"flow-down\\" clause that applies the same requirements to subcontractors. A June 2013 Congressional report found there were over 50 statutes relevant to cybersecurity compliance. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) is one of the key statutes governing federal cybersecurity regulations. United States =Federal government= There are few federal cybersecurity regulations, and the ones that exist focus on specific industries. The three main cybersecurity regulations are the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the 1999 Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act, and the 2002 Homeland Security Act, which included the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). The three regulations mandate that healthcare organizations, financial institutions and federal agencies should protect their systems and information. For example, FISMA, which applies to every government agency, \\"requires the development and implementation of mandatory policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security.\\" However, the regulations do not address numerous computer related industries, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and software companies. Furthermore, the regulations do not specify what cybersecurity measures must be implemented and require only a \\"reasonable\\" level of security. The vague language of these regulations leaves much room for interpretation. Bruce Schneier, the founder of Cupertino's Counterpane Internet Security, argues that companies will not make sufficient investments in cybersecurity unless government forces them to do so. He also states that successful cyberattacks on government systems still occur despite government efforts. It has been suggested that the Data Quality Act already provides the Office of Management and Budget the statutory authority to implement critical infrastructure protection regulations by the Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking process. The idea has not been fully vetted and would require additional legal analysis before a rulemaking could begin. =State governments= State governments have attempted to improve cybersecurity by increasing public visibility of firms with weak security. In 2003, California passed the Notice of Security Breach Act, which requires that any company that maintains personal information of California citizens and has a security breach must disclose the details of the event. Personal information includes name, social security number, driver's license number, credit card number or financial information. Several other states have followed California's example and passed similar security breach notification regulations. Such security breach notification regulations punish firms for their cybersecurity failures while giving them the freedom to choose how to secure their systems. Also, the regulation creates an incentive for companies to voluntarily invest in cybersecurity to avoid the potential loss of reputation and the resulting economic loss that can come from a successful cyber attack. In 2004, the California State Legislature passed California Assembly Bill 1950, which also applies to businesses that own or maintain personal information for California residents. The regulation dictates for businesses to maintain a reasonable level of security and that they required security practices also extend to business partners. The regulation is an improvement on the federal standard because it expands the number of firms required to maintain an acceptable standard of cybersecurity. However, like the federal legislation, it requires a \\"reasonable\\" level of cybersecurity, which leaves much room for interpretation until case law is established. =Proposed regulation= The US Congress has proposed numerous bills that expand upon cybersecurity regulation. The Consumer Data Security and Notification Act amends the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act to require disclosure of security breaches by financial institutions. Congressmen have also proposed \\"expanding Gramm-Leach-Bliley to all industries that touch consumer financial information, including any firm that accepts payment by a credit card.\\" Congress has proposed cybersecurity regulations similar to California's Notice of Security Breach Act for companies that maintain personal information. The Information Protection and Security Act requires that data brokers \\"ensure data accuracy and confidentiality, authenticate and track users, detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and mitigate potential harm to individuals.\\" In addition to requiring companies to improve cybersecurity, Congress is also considering bills that criminalize cyberattacks. The Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass Act (SPY ACT) was a bill of this type. It focused on phishing and spyware bill and was passed on May 23, 2005 in the US House of Representatives but died in the US Senate. The bill \\"makes unlawful the unauthorized usage of a computer to take control of it, modify its setting, collect or induce the owner to disclose personally identifiable information, install unsolicited software, and tamper with security, anti-spyware, or anti- virus software.\\" On May 12, 2011, US Barack Obama proposed a package of cybersecurity legislative reforms to improve the security of US persons, the federal government, and critical infrastructure. A year of public debate and Congress hearings followed, resulting in the House of Representative passing an information sharing bill and the Senate developing a compromise bill seeking to balance national security, privacy, and business interests. In July 2012, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 was proposed by Senators Joseph Lieberman and Susan Collins. The bill would have required creating voluntary \\"best practice standards\\" for protection of key infrastructure from cyber attacks, which businesses would be encouraged to adopt through incentives such as liability protection. The bill was put to a vote in the Senate but failed to pass. Obama had voiced his support for the Act in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, and it also received support from officials in the military and national security including John O. Brennan, the chief counterterrorism adviser to the White House. According to The Washington Post, experts said that the failure to pass the act may leave the United States \\"vulnerable to widespread hacking or a serious cyberattack.\\" The act was opposed by Republican senators like John McCain who was concerned that the act would introduce regulations that would not be effective and could be a \\"burden\\" for businesses. After the Senate vote, Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison stated that the opposition to the bill was not a partisan issue but it not take the right approach to cybersecurity.The senate vote was not strictly along partisan lines, as six Democrats voted against it, and five Republicans voted for it. Critics of the bill included the US Chamber of Commerce, advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, cybersecurity expert Jody Westby, and The Heritage Foundation, both of whom argued that although the government must act on cybersecurity, the bill was flawed in its approach and represented \\"too intrusive a federal role.\\" In February 2013, Obama proposed the Executive Order Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. It represents the latest iteration of policy but is not considered to be law as it has not been addressed by Congress yet. It seeks to improve existing public-private partnerships by enhancing timeliness of information flow between DHS and critical infrastructure companies. It directs federal agencies to share cyber threat intelligence warnings to any private sector entity identified as a target. It also tasks DHS with improving the process to expedite security clearance processes for applicable public and private sector entities to enable the federal government to share this information at the appropriate sensitive and classified levels. It directs the development of a framework to reduce cyber risks, incorporating current industry best practices and voluntary standards. Lastly, it tasks the federal agencies involved with incorporating privacy and civil liberties protections in line with Fair Information Practice Principles. In January 2015, Obama announced a new cybersecurity legislative proposal. The proposal was made in an effort to prepare the US from the expanding number of cyber crimes. In the proposal, Obama outlined three main efforts to work towards a more secure cyberspace for the US. The first main effort emphasized the importance of enabling cybersecurity information sharing. By enabling that, the proposal encouraged information sharing between the government and the private sector. That would allow the government to know what main cyber threats private firms are facing and would then allow the government to provide liability protection to those firms that shared their information. Furthermore, that would give the government a better idea of what the US needs to be protected against. Another main effort that was emphasized in this proposal was to modernize the law enforcement authorities to make them more equipped to properly deal with cyber crimes by giving them the tools they need in order to do so. It would also update classifications of cyber crimes and consequences. One way this would be done would be by making it a crime for overseas selling of financial information. Another goal of the effort is to place cyber crimes prosecutable. The last major effort of the legislative proposal was to require businesses to report data breaching to consumers if their personal information had been sacrificed. By requiring companies to do so, consumers are aware of when they are in danger of identity theft. In February 2016, Obama developed a Cybersecurity National Security Action Plan (CNAP). The plan was made to create long-term actions and strategies in an effort to protect the US against cyber threats. The focus of the plan was to inform the public about the growing threat of cyber crimes, improve cybersecurity protections, protects personal information of Americans, and to inform Americans on how to control digital security. One of the highlights of this plan include creating a \\"Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity.\\" The goal of this is to create a Commission that consists of a diverse group of thinkers with perspectives that can contribute to make recommendations on how to create a stronger cybersecurity for the public and private sector. The second highlight of the plan is to change Government IT. The new Government IT will make it so that a more secure IT can be put in place. The third highlight of the plan is to give Americans knowledge on how they can secure their online accounts and avoid theft of their personal information through multi-factor authentication. The fourth highlight of the plan is to invest 35% more money that was invested in 2016 into cybersecurity. =Other government efforts= In addition to regulation, the federal government has tried to improve cybersecurity by allocating more resources to research and collaborating with the private sector to write standards. In 2003, the President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace made the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for security recommendations and researching national solutions. The plan calls for cooperative efforts between government and industry \\"to create an emergency response system to cyber-attacks and to reduce the nation's vulnerability to such threats \\" In 2004, the US Congress allocated $4.7 billion toward cybersecurity and achieving many of the goals stated in the President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. Some industry security experts state that the President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is a good first step but is insufficient. Bruce Schneier stated, \\"The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace hasn't secured anything yet.\\" However, the President's National Strategy clearly states that the purpose is to provide a framework for the owners of computer systems to improve their security rather than the government taking over and solving the problem. However, companies that participate in the collaborative efforts outlined in the strategy are not required to adopt the discovered security solutions. In the United States, the US Congress is trying to make information more transparent after the Cyber Security Act of 2012, which would have created voluntary standards for protecting vital infrastructure, failed to pass through the Senate. In February 2013, the White House issued an executive order, titled \\"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,\\" which allows the executive branch to share information about threats with more companies and individuals. In April 2013, the House of Representatives passed the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), which calls for protecting against lawsuits aimed at companies that disclose breach information. The Obama administration said that it might veto the bill. India In the light of the hacking of the website of the Indian Space Agency's commercial arm in 2015, Antrix Corporation and government's Digital India programme, a cyberlaw expert and advocate at the Supreme Court of India, Pavan Duggal, stated that \\"a dedicated cyber security legislation as a key requirement for India. It is not sufficient to merely put cyber security as a part of the IT Act. We have to see cyber security not only from the sectoral perspective, but also from the national perspective.\\" European Union Cybersecurity standards have been of great prominence in today's technology driven businesses. To maximize their profits, corporations leverage technology by running most of their operations by the internet. Since there are a large number of risks that entail internetwork operations, such operations must be protected by comprehensive and extensive regulations. Existing cybersecurity regulations all cover different aspects of business operations and often vary by region or country in which a business operates. Because of the differences in a country's society, infrastructure, and values, one overarching cyber security standard is not optimal for decreasing risks. While US standards provide a basis for operations, the European Union has created a more tailored regulation for businesses operating specifically within the EU. Also, in light of Brexit, it is important to consider how the UK has chosen to adhere to such security regulations. Three major regulations within the EU include the ENISA, the NIS Directive and the EU GDPR. They are part of the Digital Single Market strategy. =ENISA= The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is a governing agency that was originally set up by the Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 for the Purpose of Raising Network and Information Security (NIS) for all internetwork operations in the EU. ENISA currently runs under Regulation (EU) No 526/2013, which has replaced the original regulation in 2013. ENISA works actively with all member states of the EU to provide a range of services. The focus of their operations are on three factors: * Recommendations to member states on the course of action for security breaches * Policy making and implementation support for all members states of the EU * Direct support with ENISA taking a hands-on approach to working with operational teams in the EU ENISA is made up of a management board that relies on the support of the executive director and the Permanent Stakeholders Group. Most operations, however, are run by the heads of various departments. ENISA has released various publications that cover all major issues on cybersecurity. ENISA's past and current initiatives include the EU Cloud Strategy, Open Standards in Information Communications Technology, a Cyber Security Strategy of the EU and a Cyber Security Coordination Group. ENISA also works in collaboration with existing international standard organizations like the ISO and the ITU. =NIS Directive= On July 6, 2016, the European Parliament set into policy the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (the NIS Directive). The directive went into effect in August 2016, and all member states of the European Union were given 21 months to incorporate the directive's regulations into their own national laws. The aim of the NIS Directive is to create an overall higher level of cybersecurity in the EU. The directive significantly affects digital service providers (DSPs) and operators of essential services (OESs). Operators of essential services include any organizations whose operations would be greatly affected in the case of a security breach if they engage in critical societal or economic activities. Both DSPs and OES are now held accountable for reporting major security incidents to Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT). While DSPs are not held to as stringent regulations as operators of essential services, DSPs that are not set up in the EU but still operate in the EU still face regulations. Even if DSPs and OES outsource the maintenance of their information systems to third parties, the NIS Directive still holds them accountable for any security incidents. The member states of the EU are required to create a NIS directive strategy, which includes the CSIRTs, in addition to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Such resources are given the responsibility of handling cybersecurity breaches in a way that minimizes impact. In addition, all member states of the EU are encouraged to share cyber security information. Security requirements include technical measures that manage the risks of cybersecurity breaches in a preventative manner. Both DSP and OES must provide information that allows for an in depth assessment of their information systems and security policies. All significant incidents must be notified to the CSIRTs. Significant cybersecurity incidents are determined by the number of users affected by the security breach as well as the longevity of the incident and the geographical reach of the incident. =EU Cybersecurity Act= The EU Cybersecurity Act establishes an EU-wide cybersecurity certification framework for digital products, services and processes. It complements the NIS Directive. ENISA will have a key role in setting up and maintaining the European cybersecurity certification framework. =EU GDPR= The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was set into place on 14 April 2016, but the current date of enforcement is set to be on 25 May 2018. The GDPR aims to bring a single standard for data protection among all member states in the EU. Changes include the redefining of geographical borders. It applies to entities that operate in the EU or deal with the data of any resident of the EU. Regardless of where the data is processed, if an EU citizen's data is being processed, the entity is now subject to the GDPR. Fines are also much more stringent under the GDPR and can total ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% of an entity's annual turnover, whichever is higher. In addition, like in previous regulations, all data breaches that effect the rights and freedoms of individuals residing in the EU must be disclosed within 72 hours. The overarching board, the EU Data Protection Board, EDP, is in charge of all oversight set by the GDPR. Consent plays a major role in the GDPR. Companies that hold data in regards to EU citizens must now also offer to them the right to back out of sharing data just as easily as when they consented to sharing data. In addition, citizens can also restrict processing of the data stored on them and can choose to allow companies to store their data but not process it, which creates a clear differentiation. Unlike previous regulations, the GDPR also restricts the transfer of a citizen's data outside of the EU or to a third party without a citizen's prior consent. The proposed ePrivacy Regulation is also planned to be applicable from 25 May 2018. Reactions While experts agree that cybersecurity improvements are necessary, there is disagreement about whether the solution is more government regulation or more private-sector innovation. =Support= Many government officials and cybersecurity experts believe that the private sector has failed to solve the cybersecurity problem and that regulation is needed. Richard Clarke states that \\"industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If industry does not respond [to the threat], you have to follow through.\\" He believes that software companies must be forced to produce more secure programs. Bruce Schneier also supports regulation that encourages software companies to write more secure code through economic incentives. US Representative Rick Boucher (D‚ÄìVA) proposes improving cybersecurity by making software companies liable for security flaws in their code. In addition, to improving software security, Clarke believes that certain industries, such as utilities and ISPs, require regulation. =Opposition= On the other hand, many private-sector executives and lobbyists believe that more regulation will restrict their ability to improve cybersecurity. Harris Miller, a lobbyist and president of the Information Technology Association of America, believes that regulation inhibits innovation. Rick White, former corporate attorney and president and CEO of the lobby group TechNet, also opposes more regulation. He states that \\"the private-sector must continue to be able to innovate and adapt in response to new attack methods in cyber space, and toward that end, we commend President Bush and the Congress for exercising regulatory restraint.\\" Another reason many private-sector executives oppose regulation is that it is costly and involves government oversight in private enterprise. Firms are just as concerned about regulation reducing profits as they are about regulation limiting their flexibility to solve the cybersecurity problem efficiently.

Founding at Gilesgate The hospital was founded at Gilesgate, Durham, by Bishop Flambard as an almshouse \\"for the keeping of the poor who enter the same hospital\\". It was dedicated to God and St Giles, the patron saint of beggars and cripples. The first hospital chapel (now St Giles Church, Gilesgate) was dedicated in June 1112. Other than the church, the original buildings were wooden or wattle-and-daub structures. Flambard endowed the hospital with a range of lands, including the manor of Caldecotes, the mill on Durham's Millburn, and corn from fifteen of his villages. Godric of Finchale was a doorkeeper of the hospital church before settling at Finchale. The hospital buildings (with the exception of the church) were destroyed along with Caldecotes by the men of William Cumin, Chancellor of King David I of Scotland, who claimed to be the rightfully elected Bishop of Durham, to prevent succour to the advancing army of his opponent, William of St. Barbara. Building at Kepier The hospital was refounded beside the River Wear at Kepier, c.1180, by Bishop Hugh le Puiset with an establishment of thirteen brethren, serving around thirteen (male) inmates as well as travellers and pilgrims. Puiset bestowed more lands, including the village of Clifton, a lead-mine in Weardale, a peat bog at Newton, and more rights to corn from the Bishop's villages (gillycorn). To further secure the finances of the hospital, Puiset granted a charter allowing the creation of the borough of St Giles, the nucleus of modern Gilesgate, with many burgesses probably drawn from Caldecotes and Clifton. Kepier was frequently bound up with the politics of the border country, with Edward I and Queen Isabella staying at the hospital on their journeys north. Kepier suffered from raids by the Scots, with goods seized from Durham in 1315 and the raiding of Kepiers' northern possessions. Dissolution Kepier Hospital was inspected in 1535 as part of Henry VIII's Valor Ecclesiasticus survey of monasteries. It was shown to be the richest hospital in the diocese, devoting 25% of its gross annual income of ¬£186 0s. 10d. to almsgiving. Kepier maintained four choral chaplains and 10 inmates, and distributed doles to the poor at the gates of ¬£16 5s. a year. Henry ordered the closure of the lesser monastic houses (including Kepier) prompting the doomed Pilgrimage of Grace rebellion. The Master of the Hospital supported the Bishop of Durham in opposing the Pilgrims, but its (lay) steward Sir John Bulmer was executed for participating in the rebellion. Legislation of 1539 extended the suppression to some hospitals, which included Kepier, but spared Sherburn Hospital and Greatham Hospital. Kepier and its lands were granted to Henry's Secretary of State, Sir William Paget, although these soon reverted to the Crown and thence to a succession of lay owners including the Scotsman John Cockburn of Ormiston. Buildings and paths The first hospital church remains in use as the parish church of St Giles, Gilesgate. No other buildings from the first hospital survive. Lay owners of Kepier, the Heath family, made substantial alterations to the hospital site, including laying out of gardens and the erection of a mansion where the chapel and infirmary may have once stood. By 1827 this house had become a 'Kepier Inn' or the 'White Bear'. Kepier Mill survived until 1870, when it was destroyed by fire. Of the hospital site itself, the gatehouse is intact, the mansion survives as ruins, and the farmhouse is in private use. The site is now a Scheduled Monument with grade I and grade II* listed building status. The West Range is included on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk register. Many of the routes of travel between Kepier, Gilesgate and the hospitals lands at Caldecotes and Clifton‚Äîby now High Grange (in modern Gilesgate Moor) and Low Grange (in modern Carrville)‚Äîexist as public footpaths and bridleways. The tithe barn at High Grange, used to store Kepier's corn, survived until 1964. References *Meade, Dorothy M. Kepier Hospital.

It is employed when one solution y_1(x) is known and a second linearly independent solution y_2(x) is desired. The method also applies to n-th order equations. In this case the ansatz will yield an (n-1)-th order equation for v.  Second-order linear ordinary differential equations =An example= Consider the general, homogeneous, second-order linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equation. (ODE) : a y(x) + b y'(x) + c y(x) = 0, \\\\; where a, b, c are real non-zero coefficients. Two linearly independent solutions for this ODE can be straightforwardly found using characteristic equations except for the case when the discriminant, b^2 - 4 a c, vanishes. In this case, : a y(x) + b y'(x) + \\\\frac{b^2}{4a} y(x) = 0, \\\\; from which only one solution, :y_1(x) = e^{-\\\\frac{b}{2 a} x}, can be found using its characteristic equation. The method of reduction of order is used to obtain a second linearly independent solution to this differential equation using our one known solution. To find a second solution we take as a guess :y_2(x) = v(x) y_1(x) \\\\; where v(x) is an unknown function to be determined. Since y_2(x) must satisfy the original ODE, we substitute it back in to get : a \\\\left( v y_1 + 2 v' y_1' + v y_1 \\\\right) + b \\\\left( v' y_1 + v y_1' \\\\right) + \\\\frac{b^2}{4a} v y_1 = 0. Rearranging this equation in terms of the derivatives of v(x) we get : \\\\left(a y_1 \\\\right) v + \\\\left( 2 a y_1' + b y_1 \\\\right) v' + \\\\left( a y_1 + b y_1' + \\\\frac{b^2}{4a} y_1 \\\\right) v = 0. Since we know that y_1(x) is a solution to the original problem, the coefficient of the last term is equal to zero. Furthermore, substituting y_1(x) into the second term's coefficient yields (for that coefficient) :2 a \\\\left( - \\\\frac{b}{2 a} e^{-\\\\frac{b}{2 a} x} \\\\right) + b e^{-\\\\frac{b}{2 a} x} = \\\\left( -b + b \\\\right) e^{-\\\\frac{b}{2 a} x} = 0. Therefore, we are left with : a y_1 v = 0. \\\\; Since a is assumed non-zero and y_1(x) is an exponential function (and thus always non-zero), we have : v = 0. \\\\; This can be integrated twice to yield : v(x) = c_1 x + c_2 \\\\; where c_1, c_2 are constants of integration. We now can write our second solution as : y_2(x) = ( c_1 x + c_2 ) y_1(x) = c_1 x y_1(x) + c_2 y_1(x). \\\\; Since the second term in y_2(x) is a scalar multiple of the first solution (and thus linearly dependent) we can drop that term, yielding a final solution of : y_2(x) = x y_1(x) = x e^{-\\\\frac{b}{2 a} x}. Finally, we can prove that the second solution y_2(x) found via this method is linearly independent of the first solution by calculating the Wronskian :W(y_1,y_2)(x) = \\\\begin{vmatrix} y_1 & x y_1  y_1' & y_1 + x y_1' \\\\end{vmatrix} = y_1 ( y_1 + x y_1' ) - x y_1 y_1' = y_1^{2} + x y_1 y_1' - x y_1 y_1' = y_1^{2} = e^{-\\\\frac{b}{a}x} eq 0. Thus y_2(x) is the second linearly independent solution we were looking for. =General method= Given the general non-homogeneous linear differential equation :y+p(t)y'+q(t)y=r(t)\\\\, and a single solution y_1(t) of the homogeneous equation [r(t)=0], let us try a solution of the full non- homogeneous equation in the form: :y_2=v(t)y_1(t)\\\\, where v(t) is an arbitrary function. Thus :y_2'=v'(t)y_1(t)+v(t)y_1'(t)\\\\, and :y_2=v(t)y_1(t)+2v'(t)y_1'(t)+v(t)y_1(t).\\\\, If these are substituted for y, y', and y in the differential equation, then :y_1(t)\\\\,v+(2y_1'(t)+p(t)y_1(t))\\\\,v'+(y_1(t)+p(t)y_1'(t)+q(t)y_1(t))\\\\,v=r(t). Since y_1(t) is a solution of the original homogeneous differential equation, y_1(t)+p(t)y_1'(t)+q(t)y_1(t)=0, so we can reduce to :y_1(t)\\\\,v+(2y_1'(t)+p(t)y_1(t))\\\\,v'=r(t) which is a first-order differential equation for v'(t) (reduction of order). Divide by y_1(t), obtaining :v+\\\\left(\\\\frac{2y_1'(t)}{y_1(t)}+p(t)\\\\right)\\\\,v'=\\\\frac{r(t)}{y_1(t)}. The integrating factor is \\\\mu(t)=e^{\\\\int(\\\\frac{2y_1'(t)}{y_1(t)}+p(t))dt}=y_1^2(t)e^{\\\\int p(t) dt}. Multiplying the differential equation by the integrating factor \\\\mu(t), the equation for v(t) can be reduced to :\\\\frac{d}{dt}(v'(t) y_1^2(t) e^{\\\\int p(t) dt})=y_1(t)r(t)e^{\\\\int p(t) dt}. After integrating the last equation, v'(t) is found, containing one constant of integration. Then, integrate v'(t) to find the full solution of the original non-homogeneous second-order equation, exhibiting two constants of integration as it should: :y_2(t)=v(t)y_1(t)\\\\, .

Overview  { class= \\"rimage\\"  } Previously Intellipool Network Monitor, now called Kaseya Network Monitor (KNM) is administrated through a web interface and is installed as a service on a computer running Windows 2000, XP or 2003. Features agentless monitoring of availability and collection of performance statistics from databases, applications, network equipment and servers such as: * Windows (R) NT, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008 * Windows eventlog and syslog * Active directory * Unix, Linux and BSD * SQL Databases such as Microsoft SQL, Oracle and MySql * Mail servers such as Microsoft Exchange and MDaemon (by Alt-N Technologies) * File servers * System log files * SNMP enabled network equipment such as routers and switches * Traffic and bandwidth * Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) * Environment monitoring devices (temperature, humidity, water leaks) * Kaseya Network Monitor can be extended with custom LUA scripts (Lua programming language). = Agentless testing = The term \\"agentless\\" refers to testing being done without the need to install software on the monitored system. While agentless testing was traditionally considered to be inferior to agent testing, development of many remote management and testing protocols such as WMI means agentless monitoring can provide the same detail as Agent based monitoring .  Distributed model  { class= \\"rimage\\"  } The Distributed model makes it possible to monitor servers, routers and other network connected equipment that are inaccessible or only accessible through a low bandwidth connection. To accomplish this a gateway is installed in the remote network. The gateway will act on instructions from the master KNM installation. = Server = The KNM server contains the configuration and user interface. Remote objects are managed the same way as locally tested objects to simplify administration. = Gateway = The KNM gateway can be installed on any available machine in the remote network and does not require a dedicated server. = Security = Security and data integrity is achieved by using the SSH 2.0 communication protocol. The SSH 2.0 protocol encrypts data with public key algorithms and protects connections from man-in-the- middle attacks. To further enhance security the INM gateway never stores the configuration. Configuration is requested from the KNM server upon startup and is updated automatically when it changes on the KNM server.  Extending  KNM incorporates the Lua scripting language to provide a facility to extend the product with customer developed tests.

It was started by Steve Bjorklund (vocals, guitar) after the demise of The Rabbits. The principal musicians, besides Bjorklund, were his brother Chris (guitar), Pierre Kezdy (bass), and Bob Furem (drums). Background Strike Under was founded in 1979 or 1980. Although American punk is generally considered to have started four or five years earlier, punk and new wave music arrived in Chicago far later than on either coast, so that Strike Under is correctly still considered an \\"early\\" Chicago punk band. They can also be seen as one of the first and most important bands of the \\"second wave\\" of Chicago punk, as it turned toward a more hardcore scene and sound, and as an archetype of Chicago hardcore. In 1981, Strike Under released a 5-song 12\\" EP record, Immediate Action, notable as the first release by the new label Wax Trax Records (the record is commonly known as WAX 001, although the actual catalog number is Wax Trax 103015X). The album cover resembled a book of matches (the band's name derives from the phrase commonly seen on cheap matchbooks). Songs included \\"Sunday Night Disorientation\\", \\"Context\\", \\"Closing In\\", \\"Elephant's Graveyard\\" (which later appeared on the Wax Trax Best of boxed set), and the title track. Immediate Action received mixed reviews; however, as one of the first actual recordings by a local punk outfit in the Windy City, looms large in the memory of denizens of the early Chicago punk scene, and has been called an \\"integral document to the history of punk rock in Chicago\\". Strike Under, besides releasing its own record, played out at clubs such as O'Banion's, and also appeared on the 1981 Busted at Oz LP, which is usually viewed as an historic document of the second wave of Chicago punk, recorded at the club Oz before it closed down. Strike Under broke up in late 1981. Steve Bjorklund briefly formed another Chicago punk band, Terminal Beach, then ultimately relocated to Minneapolis to pursue playing and recording with various punk and industrial music bands, including Breaking Circus. The other three members formed Trial By Fire, which played throughout Chicago in 1982. After Trial By Fire broke up, Pierre Kezdy went on to play with Naked Raygun and Pegboy. Chris Bjorklund played first with Bloodsport and then with The Effigies during the mid and late 1980s, the latter being another leading 1980s Chicago hardcore band who happened to be fronted by Pierre Kezdy's brother, John Kezdy. Strike Under was profiled in the 2007 documentary You Weren't There. The film featured interviews with both Bjorklund brothers and Pierre Kezdy.

In May 2013Walker introduced as head of racing, operations Walker became President of operations and competition of IndyCar until the finalization of the 2015 Indycar season.  Career  =Formula One= He started in auto racing as a chief mechanic for the Brabham Formula One team from 1970 to 1975. =Penske and IndyCars= When Penske left F1, Penske hired Walker as a mechanic. He stayed with Penske in some capacity until 1987. From 1977 until 1980 he was the general manager of Penske Cars' manufacturing facility in Poole, England. He became Penske's Vice President of racing, and watched the team win four PPG Cups (series championships) and four Indianapolis 500 races. Some of the most successful American drivers came through the Penske program during that period, including Rick Mears, Bobby Unser, Al Unser Sr. and Danny Sullivan. =Porsche and team ownership= In 1988 the lone Porsche Indy Car team suffered a tragic loss with the death of team owner Al Holbert. Walker took over team management. With driver Teo Fabi, they won the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, the only one in the storied marque's Indy Car career. When the team went under, Walker purchased their assets, renamed Walker Motorsports. Walker ran Willy T. Ribbs sporadically until 1994, but enjoyed his best success in the early seasons with Scott Goodyear. Goodyear came second to Al Unser, Jr. in the 1992 Indianapolis 500Small Garage Gives Big, Ritzy Indy-Type Racers a Run for the Money by 0.043 seconds, the closest finish to date in the race's history, and later won the 1992 Michigan 500 for Walker over then-Penske newcomer Paul Tracy. Goodyear and Robby Gordon spent large amounts of time with Walker, with 1996 their last season. Gordon left to pursue a further NASCAR career with Goodyear in the new Indy Racing League. Walker hired Gil de Ferran, who came close to winning the 1997 title without winning a single race. He ran a second car for Naoki Hattori and Memo Gidley in 1999 but neither did well. Walker also ran a team in the Indy Racing League for Sarah Fisher in 2000 and 2001 with limited success. =A litany of pay-drivers= In 2000 Goodyear, Walker's tire supplier, pulled out of Indy Car racing and moved with de Ferran off to Penske. Walker was forced to hire a pay-driver and found one in F1 refugee Shinji Nakano. Nakano did a fair job, placing better than was expected despite missing a couple of races due to a testing accident. Bryan Herta filled in but was unavailable to run full-time in 2001. Walker hired another Japanese ex-F1 driver in Toranosuke Takagi, who brought sponsorship from Pioneer. Takagi stayed two seasons with Rodolfo Lavin and Darren Manning, running out-dated Reynard chassis in 2003. The team ran a third car for Luis Diaz at Mexico City. Manning scored the team's best result of the year, finishing 2nd in a bizarre race at Surfer's Paradise. Unfortunately he left for Chip Ganassi Racing and Walker downsized to one car, running a lone Reynard for Mario Haberfeld. =A new era= Following the 2004 season, Walker sold a share of the team to Australian businessmen Craig Gore and John Fish, rebranding the team as Team Australia.Bigger things expected from Australian Indy team The team signed Alex Tagliani and Marcus Marshall to run Aussie Vineyards-sponsored Lola chassis for the 2005 season, with Walker remaining at the helm. In late 2005 Will Power was drafted in place of Marshall, with the Power/Tagliani combination proving a solid one as the team rises with the added stability and increased funding under the Team Australia relationship. In 2006 Team Australia established a Champ Car Atlantic Championship team for drivers James Davison and Simon Pagenaud. Walker is also co-owner of Formula BMW USA team Walker Haberfeld Racing, with former Walker driver Mario Haberfeld for drivers Marco Santos and David Rangel. On 7 April 2007, Walker won his first race as a team owner since 1999. Team Australia's Will Power won the inaugural Las Vegas GP.

Nearly the entire canyon is located within the western half of Zion National Park. Description A side view of the canyon The Zion Narrows Large view of the canyon The beginning of the canyon is usually delineated as the Temple of Sinawava, a vertical-walled natural amphitheater nearly deep. The canyon actually begins much further upstream, however, and runs southward about through the Narrows to reach the Temple, where a seasonal tributary of the North Fork plunges over a tall waterfall during spring runoff and after heavy rain. The gorge then runs southwest through the national park, approaching deep in places. While the canyon rim is dominated by desert, the canyon floor supports a forest and riparian zone watered by the North Fork Virgin River. The gorge then merges with Pine Creek Canyon as it winds out of the national park and past the community of Springdale. The canyon's end is where it meets the Virgin River, some northeast of Lake Mead, which the river ultimately flows into. Zion Canyon Drive and Zion-Mount Carmel Highway are the two major roads throughout the canyon. Zion Canyon Drive ends at the Temple of Sinawava, where the Riverside Walk trail follows the river upstream to the lower end of the Zion Narrows. Hiking trails further upstream descend into the Narrows, where the canyon floor is on average wide. Hiking is permitted in the Narrows when water levels are low enough, however, flash floods are known to rise quickly following heavy rainstorms. Many areas in the drainage of Zion Canyon have little or no soil cover, contributing to extremely brief but heavy storm runoff. In contrast, the floor of most of the main Zion Canyon is close to wide, and is rich with river-deposited sediments. Tributaries to the river within the canyon include Deep, Kolob, Goose, Pine, and Oak Creeks. Geology and history Zion Canyon viewed from a narrow point on the Angel's Landing trail, showing the immense vertical relief Geologically Zion Canyon is part of the Navajo sandstone Colorado Plateau, which contained many joints and cracks when first uplifted, one of which was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River to become Zion Canyon. The river was the largest force in cutting the canyon, mostly by flash floods, as the average flow of the river is very light. This relatively quick downcutting has left many seasonal tributaries with hanging valleys. Some of the largest tributaries have cut down to nearly an equal elevation as the valley floor. Erosion continues to sculpt the canyon walls, creating natural arches and other rock formations. It is believed that there is another of vertical bedrock that the Virgin River can still erode. Mass wasting, often caused by ice wedging into cracks in the canyon walls, is another force that widens the valley. The Navajo Sandstone formation is easily eroded and is known to be very porous. Unstable geology is prevalent throughout the canyon, and occasional rockslides have formed impounded lakes in the canyon, the most recent of which was roughly 4,000 years ago. Owing to the extreme depth of the canyon, there are many springs fed by the surrounding groundwater, permitting water in the canyon to run year round. Mormons migrated from the lower Virgin River area in the late 1850s. The canyon was named by settler Isaac Behunin, who named the canyon after a \\"place of peace\\" mentioned in 2 Samuel 5:7 of the Bible. Explorer John Wesley Powell is credited with the name Mukuntuweap, supposedly the native name of the canyon. In 1909, the canyon was first declared a national monument, and in 1919 was declared a national park. The Zion-Mount Carmel Highway, cutting through Pine Creek Canyon and lower Zion Canyon, first opened in 1930.

This usually takes place 2‚Äì3 days after rain or irrigation in pervious soils of uniform structure and texture. The physical definition of field capacity (expressed symbolically as Œ∏fc) is the bulk water content retained in soil at ‚àí33 kPA/kg (or ‚àí0.33 bar) of hydraulic head or suction pressure. The term originated from Israelson and West and Frank Veihmeyer and Arthur Hendrickson. Veihmeyer and Hendrickson realized the limitation in this measurement and commented that it is affected by so many factors that, precisely, it is not a constant (for a particular soil), yet it does serve as a practical measure of soil water-holding capacity. Field capacity improves on the concept of moisture equivalent by Lyman Briggs. Veihmeyer & Hendrickson proposed this concept as an attempt to improve water-use efficiency for farmers in California during 1949. Field capacity is characterized by measuring water content after wetting a soil profile, covering it (to prevent evaporation) and monitoring the change soil moisture in the profile. Water content when the rate of change is relatively small is indicative of when drainage ceases and is called Field Capacity, it is also termed drained upper limit (DUL). Lorenzo A. Richards and Weaver found that water content held by soil at a potential of ‚àí33 kPa (or ‚àí0.33 bar) correlate closely with field capacity (‚àí10 kPa for sandy soils). Criticism There are also critiques of this concept; field capacity is a static measurement, in a field it depends upon the initial water content and the depth of wetting before the commencement of redistribution and the rate of change in water content over time. These conditions are not unique for a given soil.

The Dynamics of An Asteroid is a fictional book by Professor James Moriarty, the implacable foe of Sherlock Holmes. The book is described by author Arthur Conan Doyle in The Valley of Fear (written in 1914, but set in 1888) when Sherlock Holmes, speaking of Professor Moriarty, states: With this class of talent, Professor Moriarty evoked the profound respect of Sherlock Holmes, one of the few opponents to do so (Irene Adler being another). Doyle also portrayed Professor Moriarty as the author of \\"a treatise on the binomial theorem\\", written when he was only 21 years of age. In addition to covering a different topic, it must have been quite a bit more accessible, since it got him a position as a chair of mathematics at a provincial university. Related real works In 1809, Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote a ground-breaking treatise on the dynamics of an asteroid (1 Ceres). However, it was understood immediatelyDonald Teets, Karen Whitehead, 1999, The Discovery of Ceres: How Gauss Became Famous, Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 72, No. 2 (Apr., 1999), pp. 83-93 and his method is still used today (see Gauss's method). Two decades before Arthur Conan Doyle's writing, the Canadian-American dynamic astronomer Simon Newcomb had published a series of books analyzing motions of planets in the solar system.Marsden, B. (1981) \\"Newcomb, Simon\\" in Gillespie, C.C. (ed.) (1981). Dictionary of Scientific Biography. 10. New York: Charles Screibner's Sons. pp. 33‚Äì36. . The notoriously spiteful Newcomb could have been an inspiration for Professor Moriarty.Schaefer, B. E., 1993, Sherlock Holmes and some astronomical connections, Journal of the British Astronomical Association, vol.103, no.1, p.30-34. An example of mathematics too abstruse to be criticized is the letters of Srinivasa Ramanujan, sent to several mathematicians at the University of Cambridge in 1913., p. 168. Only one of these mathematicians, G. H. Hardy, even recognized their merit. Despite being experts in the branches of mathematics used, he and J.E. Littlewood added that many of them \\"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before.\\" Holmes says only that \\"it is said\\" (emphasis added) that no one in the scientific press was capable of criticizing Moriarty's work; he stops short of recognizing the claim as indisputably accurate. Discussion of possible book contents Doyle provided no evidence relating to the contents of Dynamics. This has in no way prevented people from speculating about what it contained. *One esoteric branch of mathematics associated with asteroid dynamics is chaos theory. This was not appreciated by other mathematicians until the work of Henri Poincar√© in 1890, whereas Dynamics was already famous in 1888. So it is possible that Dynamics contained an early exposition of this theory. Other speculation on this topic includes: *\\"The Ultimate Crime\\", short story by Isaac Asimov, in Sherlock Holmes Through Time and Space, and in More Tales of the Black Widowers. *\\"The Dynamics of An Asteroid\\", short story by Robert Bloch, The Baker Street Journal, 1953, and also found in The Game Is Afoot. *\\"The Adventure of the Russian Grave,\\" short story by William Barton and Michael Capobianco, collected in \\"Sherlock Holmes in Orbit\\". *In the novel Spider-Man: The Revenge of the Sinister Six, by Adam-Troy Castro, a veiled reference is made to Moriarty and his Dynamics. Here the work is said to still be the authority on orbital bombardment. =Related references in media= *In \\"His Last Vow\\", the final episode of series 3 of the BBC television series Sherlock, Sherlock's mother, M.L. Holmes, is shown to have written a lengthy textbook with the title The Dynamics of Combustion, a reference to this book. *In \\"Henny Penny the Sky Is Falling\\", the 100th episode of the CBS television series Elementary, the plot evolves around a fictional paper with the title Miscalculating Near-Earth Asteroids and the Threat to Human Existence. *The pastiche novel Professor Moriarty: The Hound of the D'Urbervilles by film critic and horror novelist Kim Newman includes a chapter parodying both \\"The Adventure of the Red-Headed League\\" and H. G. Wells's novel The War of the Worlds, in which an arrogant former student of Moriarty's named Nevil Airey- Stent publicly rubbishes The Dynamics of an Asteroid to prove that it is indeed susceptible to criticism, prompting an enraged Moriarty to orchestrate an elaborate plan to drive Stent insane by convincing him that he has been contacted by visitors from the planet Mars. Citation analysis Citation analysis, which involves examining an item's referring documents, is used in searching for materials and analyzing their merit. Since citation analysis does not look at a document's contents, only references to it, it can be applied to a documents such as Dynamics or Treatise that do not in fact exist. Dynamics is referenced in the professional scientific literature, Pre-print at arXiv.orgLutz D. Schmadel, Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, International Astronomical Union. p. 434, background for name of asteroid (5048) Moriarty. and in textbooks. The list in the previous section shows 42 references to Dynamics and 27 to Treatise, which are a lower limit, since the list is not up to date. An online search, as of 2005, for these titles with author Moriarty, reveals 263 references to Dynamics and 209 to Treatise. These are very high numbers for any scientific paper, where the overall average is about 6 references. They are even more numerous when compared to other papers from the same era ‚Äì by 1900, the Royal Society's Catalog of Scientific Papers already listed 800,000 papers from 3,000 journals. Most of these have been forgotten, and only a few are still referenced today, as shown by analyses of references to old scientific articles. The Dynamics of An Asteroid is among the select group of Victorian scientific works that are still remembered and referenced even today, despite (or perhaps because of) its fictional existence.

Originally elected to the House of Representatives as a member of the ruling Alliance Party in the parliamentary election of 1972, he was expelled from the Alliance for his public attacks against the presence of Persons of Indian origin (Indo-Fijians) in Fiji. He had introduced a parliamentary motion calling for a resolution stating: \\"That this House agrees that the time has arrived when Indians or people of Indian origin in this country be repatriated back to India and that their travelling expenses back home and compensation for their properties in this country be met by the British Government.\\" Butadroka founded the Fijian Nationalist Party, which took 24.4 percent of the vote in the general election held in March 1977. Although the party won only one parliamentary seat, its votes were mostly at the expense of the Alliance. This allowed the opposition National Federation Party to win a plurality, precipitating a constitutional crisis. Butadroka became one of the leaders of the Taukei Movement in 1987, whose agitation formed the backdrop to the two military coups that deposed the elected government and severed Fiji's ties to the British Monarchy that year. Otherwise, however, he operated largely on the political fringes for many years. He strongly opposed the adoption of the present constitution, which reversed most of the provisions institutionalizing ethnic Fijian supremacy in the earlier 1990 constitution. When Parliament passed the new constitution, Butadroka publicly burnt it. In 1999, he merged his party, now called the Nationalist United Front Party (FNUPF), with Iliesa Duvuloco's Vanua Tako Lavo Party to form the Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party. The party won one seat, though Butadroka himself was not elected. The election brought the Fiji Labour Party-led People's Coalition to power, with an Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, Mahendra Chaudhry. Butadroka became involved with a campaign to destabilize the Chaudhry government, and his party was implicated by Maciu Navakasuasua, who was convicted of coup-related offences, in the planning of the coup d'√©tat which deposed it in May 2000.

Governor- General of the Philippines Usually called mariscal (marshal) as he was the first field marshal to govern the Islands, Bustamante was the former alcalde mayor of Trascala, in Nueva Espa√±a (modern-day Mexico). He was appointed governor by royal provision on September 6, 1708 and arrived at Manila on August 9, 1717. Considered severe in judgments, Bustamante was also responsible for re-establishing the garrison at Zamboanga in 1718. Relationship with the Church Several individuals with pending charges had taken church asylum. Bustamante adopted very stringent measures to counteract excessive claims to immunity by Archbishop of Manila Francisco de la Cuesta. Archbishop De la Cuesta was appealed to either hand them over to the civil authorities or allow them to be taken. He refused to do either, supporting the claim of immunity of sanctuary. At the same time it came to the knowledge of the governor that a movement had been set on foot against him by those citizens who favoured the Archbishop ºs views. Jos√© Torralba, the late acting- governor, was released from confinement by the governor, and reinstated by him as judge in the Supreme Court, although he was under an accusation of embezzlement to the extent of ‚Ç±700,000. The Archbishop energetically opposed Torralba's appointment, notifying the latter of his excommunication and ecclesiastical censures. With sword and shield in hand, Torralba expelled the Archbishop ºs messenger by force, then as judge in the Supreme Court, hastened to avenge himself by issuing warrants against his enemies. Torralba's opponents sought church asylum, and, with the moral support of the Archbishop, laughed at the clown.http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/32045/2-volume-ust-history- charts-evolution-of-higher-education-in-the- philippineshttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/22815/22815-h/22815-h.htm Tensions climaxed when the governor's soldiers stormed Manila Cathedral, thereby violating the right of sanctuary.

It was played at the beginning of each Styx show on their 1983 tour. It was written and directed by Brian Gibson of Still Crazy, What's Love Got to Do With It, The Josephine Baker Story and Poltergeist II fame. The VHS video release of the mini-film and live concert is also known as Caught in the Act in the United States. Plot The film tells of a future where rock music is outlawed by a fascist theocracy government and the \\"MMM (the Majority for Musical Morality)\\". The story's protagonist, Robert Orin Charles Kilroy, is a former rock star who has been framed for murder and imprisoned by MMM leader Dr. Everett Righteous. In this future society, policing and other peacekeeping duties are maintained by robots; in the prison where Kilroy is kept, \\"Roboto\\" humanoid models act as prison guards. Meanwhile, a young musician/activist, Jonathan Chance, is on a mission to bring rock music back. He is shown leaving a shibboleth graffiti tag, and later comes to the attention of Kilroy when he pirates an MMM video broadcast with a Kilroy video (actually the Styx music video for \\"Borrowed Time\\"). This inspires Kilroy to disable a Roboto, steal its mask as a disguise, and escape prison. At night, Chance breaks into the Paradise Theatre, the site of the Kilroy concert where an MMM member was allegedly killed by Kilroy. The theater has since been turned into an MMM museum against rock music, filled with animatronic replicas of \\"decadent\\" rock stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley, and Kilroy. Still disguised as a Roboto, the real Kilroy emerges from the shadows and reveals himself to Chance. At this point the film ends (when shown in concert, this would segue into the opening song by the band, \\"Mr. Roboto\\").

The physical definition of the wilting point, symbolically expressed as or , is said by convention as the water content at of suction pressure, or negative hydraulic head. History The concept was introduced in the early 1910s. Lyman Briggs and Homer LeRoy Shantz (1912) proposed the wilting coefficient, which is defined as the percentage water content of a soil when the plants growing in that soil are first reduced to a wilted condition from which they cannot recover in approximately saturated atmosphere without the addition of water to the soil . See pedotransfer function for wilting coefficient by Briggs.

Biography Lorenz was born in Helsing√∏r and studied at the Technical University in Copenhagen. He became professor at the Military Academy in Copenhagen 1876. From 1887, his research was funded by the Carlsberg Foundation. He investigated the mathematical description for light propagation through a single homogeneous medium and described the passage of light between different media. The formula for the mathematical relationship between the refractive index and the density of a medium was published by Lorenz in 1869 and by Hendrik Lorentz (who discovered it independently) in 1878 and is therefore called the Lorentz‚ÄìLorenz equation. Using his electromagnetic theory of light he stated what is known as the Lorenz gauge condition, and was able to derive a correct value for the velocity of light. He also developed a theory of light scattering, publishing it in Danish in 1890 and in French in his Collected Works, published in 1898. It was later independently rediscovered by Gustav Mie in 1908, so it is sometimes referred to as Lorenz‚ÄìMie theory. Additionally, Lorenz laid the foundations for ellipsometry by using Fresnel's theory of refraction to discover that light reflected by a thin transition layer between two media becomes elliptically polarized.

Illustration by artist Herb Roe A platform mound is any earthwork or mound intended to support a structure or activity. Eastern North America A diagram showing the various components of Eastern North American indigenous ceremonial substructure mounds Temple Mount at Ocmulgee National Monument The indigenous peoples of North America built substructure mounds for well over a thousand years starting in the Archaic period and continuing through the Woodland period. Many different archaeological cultures (Poverty Point culture, Troyville culture, Coles Creek culture, Plaquemine culture and Mississippian culture) of North Americas Eastern Woodlands are specifically well known for using platform mounds as a central aspect of their overarching religious practices and beliefs. These platform mounds are usually four-sided truncated pyramids, steeply sided, with steps built of wooden logs ascending one side of the earthworks. When Europeans first arrived in North America, the peoples of the Mississippian culture were still using and building platform mounds. Documented uses for Mississippian platform mounds include semi-public chief's house platforms, public temple platforms, mortuary platforms, charnel house platforms, earth lodge/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms. Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction, with the mound becoming larger with each event. The site of a mound was usually a site with special significance, either a pre-existing mortuary site or civic structure. This site was then covered with a layer of basket-transported soil and clay known as mound fill and a new structure constructed on its summit. At periodic intervals averaged about twenty years these structures would be removed, possibly ritually destroyed as part of renewal ceremonies, and a new layer of fill added, along with a new structure on the now higher summit. Sometimes the surface of the mounds would get a several inches thick coat of brightly colored clay. These layers also incorporated layers of different kinds of clay, soil and sod, an elaborate engineering technique to forestall slumping of the mounds and to ensure their steep sides did not collapse. This pattern could be repeated many times during the life of a site. The large amounts of fill needed for the mounds left large holes in the landscape now known by archaeologists as \\"borrow pits\\". These pits were sometimes left to fill with water and stocked with fish. Some mounds were developed with separate levels (or terraces) and aprons, such as Emerald Mound, which is one large terrace with two smaller mounds on its summit; or Monks Mound, which has four separate levels and stands close to in height. Monks Mound had at least ten separate periods of mound construction over a 200-year period. Some of the terraces and aprons on the mound seem to have been added to stop slumping of the enormous mound. Although the mounds were primarily meant as substructure mounds for buildings or activities, sometimes burials did occur. Intrusive burials occurred when a grave was dug into a mound and the body or a bundle of defleshed, disarticulated bones was deposited into it. Mound C at Etowah has been found to have more than 100 intrusive burials into the final layer of the mound, with many grave goods such as Mississippian copper plates (Etowah plates), monolithic stone axes, ceremonial pottery and carved whelk shell gorgets. Also interred in this mound was a paired set of white marble Mississippian stone statues. =Interpretations= A long-standing interpretation of Mississippian mounds comes from Vernon James Knight, who stated that the Mississippian platform mounds were one of the three \\"sacra\\", or objects of sacred display, of the Mississippian religion ‚Äì also see Earth/fertility cult and Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. His logic is based on analogy to ethnographic and historic data on related Native American tribal groups in the Southeastern United States. Knight suggests a microcosmic ritual organization based around a \\"native earth\\" autochthony, agriculture, fertility, and purification scheme, in which mounds and the site layout replicate cosmology. Mound rebuilding episodes are construed as rituals of burial and renewal, while the four-sided construction acts to replicate the flat earth and the four quarters of the earth.

The school's motto is the Latin phrase Fide et Operis, \\"Faith and Works\\". The position of Headteacher has been occupied by David Samuel Northwood since September 2012, after the former head, Janet Downes, retired at the end of the previous academic year. Students As with many older British Secondary schools, The Nelson Thomlinson School has a prefect system drawn from the Sixth Form. However, instead of one Head Prefect or a Head Boy & Girl pair, there are five Head Prefects who each take charge on a particular day of the week. Former pupils of the school include TV presenter Melvyn Bragg and BBC newsreader Anna Ford. There were approximately 1400 pupils aged 11‚Äì18 attending Nelson Thomlinson as of the 2014-15 academic year. = Catchment area = Most pupils at Nelson Thomlinson are from Wigton and the smaller communities within a few miles of the town which fall within its catchment area. However, some pupils come from further afield, including smaller settlements like Allonby, Bowness-on-Solway, Hesket Newmarket, and Mawbray, and also from larger towns such as Aspatria, Maryport, Silloth, and the city of Carlisle, which all have their own secondary schools. Prices for the 2014-15 academic year on a bus from Carlisle to Nelson Thomlinson we ¬£16.50 per week, and from Dalston the price was ¬£13.50 per week. The Sixth Form Since 1997 their results have placed them in the top fifty comprehensive school Sixth Forms in the country and 5 times have been in the top 10. The school also has an excellent record of students going on to study at Oxbridge, with 5 students taking up places in 2011, and 6 taking up places in 2012. Achievements The school enters students in the GCSE and A-Level examinations. Around 70% of pupils achieve 5 or more A*-Cs each year in GCSE examinations, and in terms of A-Level results, the school has been rated in the country's top 40 comprehensive school since 1997 . In a 2006 Ofsted inspection the school was judged to be an Outstanding school. In the most recent Ofsted inspection, May 2013 the school was deemed outstanding Ofsted Report, November 2006 Productions In 2016 the school organized its own production of Charles Dickens \\"Oliver Twist\\", directed by drama teacher Mrs. R.

The team reached the North West finals, which took place at the Concorde Conference Centre in Manchester Airport. The School's most successful NTS Young Enterprise to date is Digi-Pi, which was set up during the 2013/2014 academic year. This team of 10 progressed through three rounds to get to the National Finals, in which they achieved third place- a record for the school and for the county. History The Thomlinson Girls School (formed from Westmorland House owned by Isaac Pattinson and named after the cotton manufacturer John Thomlinson, and now known as the Thomlinson Junior School on The Goose Market) and The Nelson School for Boys (formed from Floshfirld House), which were both grammar schools and had opened in 1899, merged in 1953 to form the Nelson Thomlinson Grammar School. This school merged with Wigton Secondary School (a secondary modern school) in 1969 to form the Nelson Thomlinson Comprehensive School. = Controversies = In 2004, anti-social behaviour in the town centre by under-18s, many of whom were pupils at Nelson Thominson School, prompted authorities to impose a curfew on youths in Wigton. The curfew ran through the 2004 Easter holidays and prohibited any unaccompanied children under the age of 16 from being out on the streets between 21:00 and 06:00. During the curfew, instances of anti-social behaviour, such as intimidation and broken shop windows, dropped by as much as 75%. However, the curfew was not repeated after 2004. In 2014, Hayley Southwell, a teacher at Nelson Thomlinson, was arrested and pleaded guilty to charges of having sexual activity with a girl aged between 16 and 18 while in a position of trust. Her victim was a pupil at the school, and the crimes took place between May 2013 and January 2014. She was handed a 12-month suspended prison sentence and had to sign the sex offenders register for a period of ten years. During sentencing, the judge said that Southwell's relationship with her victim showed \\"a degree of grooming\\". = Headteachers = * Peter M.

Northwood (2012‚ÄìPresent) The Professional Development Room/Department Arising from a successful bid for Mathematics and Computing College Status, the school has included a room specifically designed for lesson observation. It might look like an ordinary classroom; the only apparently unusual feature is a large mirror set into one of the walls. What appears to be a mirror, however, is actually a piece of one-way glass, Behind the glass is an observation booth, from which a teacher, or group of teachers, can observe the lesson and quietly discuss what is happening.

It is also known as available water content (AWC), profile available water (PAW) or total available water (TAW). The concept, put forward by Frank Veihmeyer and Arthur Hendrickson, assumed that the water readily available to plants is the difference between the soil water content at field capacity () and permanent wilting point (): :Œ∏a ‚â° Œ∏fc ‚àí Œ∏pwp Daniel Hillel criticised that the terms FC and PWP were never clearly defined, and lack physical basis, and that soil water is never equally available within this range. He further suggested that a useful concept should concurrently consider the properties of plant, soil and meteorological conditions. Lorenzo A. Richards remarked that the concept of availability is oversimplified. He viewed that: the term availability involves two notions: (a) the ability of plant root to absorb and use the water with which it is in contact and (b) the readiness or velocity with which the soil water moves in to replace that which has been used by the plant.

The RZ was the final evolution of the popular and well-known series of RD Yamaha motorcycles, and as such is also known as the RD350LC II or RD350 YPVS. It was powered by a twin- carburetted reed valve inducted, liquid-cooled, 347 cc parallel-twin two- stroke engine, with a bore and stroke of 64mm x 54mm. It was the first and only RD series Yamaha to receive the 'YPVS' Yamaha Power Valve System. A different version of this motor with no YPVS was also used in the Yamaha Banshee 350 ATV, which was produced for some markets right up until 2012. It is also raced extensively in Vintage racing leagues, as well as its own racing leagues, often dubbed \\"RZ cups\\" in Europe and Canada. Versions There were several models, the 1985 RZ350F, 1986-92 RZ350F2,N,NF, and the 1992-5 RZ350RR which was produced in Brazil. The picture shown to the right is a model with an aftermarket \\"Expansion Chamber\\" which was a higher flowing, high- performance exhaust system, devoid of the catalytic converter and other exhaust pollution control items. Generally there were 4 main variants, produced for various markets. 1983/4 - F1 model with a bikini fairing attached to the forks, separate side and tail panels, offset fuel filler and semi- italic wheels with holes. 1985 - F1 model with RD/RZ500 style full fairing (frame mounted and using the same top panel as the 500) and Variable Damper forks, alongside N1 (naked) models with no fairing. 1985 was a transitional year between early and late models with styling from both. Detailed information on this model can be found here http://2smoked.com/Yamaha_1985_RZ250_YPVS_F1_Why_the_1985_F1_RZ350.html 1986-1992 - F2 and N2 models with a restyled fuel tank, seat and side/tail panels that looked '1 piece'. 1992-1995 - RD350R model (made in Brazil) with FZR600 style twin light top fairing and various detail differences. This version was also imported to the UK in limited numbers. The 1983-1985 models are the most collectible. The RZ350 was sold in Europe during 1983‚Äì1992, the UK during 1983‚Äì1995, Australia during 1983‚Äì1988, the United States during 1984 - 1985, and Canada in 1983‚Äì1990. EU/UK - All models were designated RD, not RZ. 1983 350 models designated 31k. 1985 F1 models introduced. New F2 and N2 models in 1986 model runs until 1992. 1992-95 UK importers bring in RD350R model (made in Brazil). Australia - Same 83 - 85 models as UK/EU, but more 250's sold due to licensing restrictions for learner riders and provisional licence holders limited to 250cc motorcycles (though many fitted ‚ÄúRZ250‚Äù decals to the larger model). 1986 sees the introduction F2/N2, but in 1987 a round light full fairing model appears. Discontinued in 1988. USA - In the USA the RZ came with catalytic converters for emissions requirements, and was the first motorcycle to do so. It was only sold in California in 1985, as the RZ350NC, and a second version was sold in late 1985 and 1986 as the RZ350NC2, both of which had an EVAP canister and an additional catalytic converter in the exhaust pipe header to meet California emission regulations. Sales of the RZ350 were discontinued in the US after 1986, as Yamaha decided the two-stroke would use too much of their United States Environmental Protection Agency fleet emissions quota, and limit sales of larger displacement bikes, which were more popular sellers. The RZ350 was the first Yamaha street bike sold in the US that used a \\"perimeter\\" frame with frame rails around the underside of the fuel tank as opposed to the standard frames of the era with a spine under the center of the fuel tank. Styling The 1984 USA models came in yellow and black (Kenny Roberts Special) and a metallic red-white and blue model with different graphics and no Kenny Roberts signature on the upper cowl. In 1985, the red-white-and blue versions had identical graphics to the yellow and black \\"bumble bee\\" Kenny Roberts version, complete with signature, but with a red frame. Leftover models with revised graphics that somewhat resembled the 1983 UK versions were also produced. These were sold as the RZ350NC2 in California only from late 1985‚Äì6 with gold rims and a Kenny Roberts signature. The estimated RZ350 production for the USA is approximately 20,000 motorcycles. The RZ350 had a variable exhaust port valve called the Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS) that was controlled by a basic computer. The YPVS could open and close the valve to move the height of the exhaust port and thus affect the exhaust port timing. This provided lower RPM torque while retaining high RPM power. The interchangeability of many of the major engine components with the Yamaha Banshee ATV has allowed strong aftermarket support for the RZ350. The RZ had a 500 cc stablemate called the RZ500. It came in a red-on-white color scheme. It was a twin-crank V4 (much like the GP bikes of the era) and was a quite different bike. Some distributors and dealers sold these bikes with custom paint jobs, causing confusion about OEM paint schemes. In many countries, these bikes were known as RDs, but in North America and Australia they were called the RZs. In Australia, England, Canada, and the USA the Yamaha RD series (RD-60, RD125, RD-200, RD250, RD350, RD400) from which the later RZ/RD were descended, were first released in the 1970s as air-cooled two-strokes. In 1980 the bikes had a redesign using ideas Yamaha gained from two-stroke Grand Prix and production race experiences. They also became liquid-cooled and had an 'LC' appended to the name to designate this e.g.: RD350LC - some people referred to them as the \\"Elsie\\". The Elsie is the link between the earlier air-cooled RDs, and the later power valve (YPVS) equipped RZ series. The most common capacities sold in Australia were 250 cc (maximum capacity allowed for new road riders) and 350 cc. The name changed to RZ (in Australia at least), with the introduction of the variable exhaust valve design in 1983 on the 'K' model. This was a whole new bike and although similar in concept, did not share any parts of the earlier LC series.

John Letey (1985) from UC Riverside introduced the NLWR concept in an attempt to integrate several physical properties associated with plant or root growth to refine the concept of available water capacity. Alvaro Pires da Silva, Bev Kay. and Ed Perfect (University of Guelph, Ontario) (1994) refined the concept and termed it least limiting water range (LLWR). The upper limit (wet end) of LLWR is determined not only at water content at field capacity (FC), but also the capability of providing adequate aeration for plant roots (usually taken as a minimum air filled porosity of 10%). The upper limit is then defined as: min q {air filled porosity = 0.1, FC}. Rather than air-filled porosity at 10%, LaoSheng Wu from UC Riverside proposed moisture content where Oxygen gas diffusion rate ODR value of 0.2 micro-g/cm2/min as criteria for satisfactory aeration status. The lower limit (dry end) is not only limited to permanent wilting point (PWP) but also the ability of root penetration. This is measured as soil mechanical resistance taken at an arbitrary value, say penetration at 3 MPa. The lower limit is defined as: max q {mechanical resistance = 3 MPa, PWP}.

Statement Ado's theorem states that every finite-dimensional Lie algebra L over a field K of characteristic zero can be viewed as a Lie algebra of square matrices under the commutator bracket. More precisely, the theorem states that L has a linear representation œÅ over K, on a finite-dimensional vector space V, that is a faithful representation, making L isomorphic to a subalgebra of the endomorphisms of V. History The theorem was proved in 1935 by Igor Dmitrievich Ado of Kazan State University, a student of Nikolai Chebotaryov. The restriction on the characteristic was later removed by Kenkichi Iwasawa (see also the below Gerhard Hochschild paper for a proof). Implications While for the Lie algebras associated to classical groups there is nothing new in this, the general case is a deeper result. Applied to the real Lie algebra of a Lie group G, it does not imply that G has a faithful linear representation (which is not true in general), but rather that G always has a linear representation that is a local isomorphism with a linear group.

Branches are also known as trees, streams or codelines. The originating branch is sometimes called the parent branch, the upstream branch (or simply upstream, especially if the branches are maintained by different organizations or individuals), or the backing stream. Child branches are branches that have a parent; a branch without a parent is referred to as the trunk or the mainline. In some distributed revision control systems, such as Darcs, there is no distinction made between repositories and branches; in these systems, fetching a copy of a repository is equivalent to branching. Branching also generally implies the ability to later merge or integrate changes back onto the parent branch. Often the changes are merged back to the trunk, even if this is not the parent branch. A branch not intended to be merged (e.g. because it has been relicensed under an incompatible license by a third party, or it attempts to serve a different purpose) is usually called a fork.  Motivations for branching  Branches allow for parts of software to be developed in parallel. Large projects require many roles to be filled, including developers, build managers, and quality assurance personnel. Further, multiple releases on different operating system platforms may have to be maintained. Branches allow contributors to isolate changes without destabilizing the codebase, for example, fixes for bugs, new features, and versions integration. These changes may be later merged (resynchronized) after testing.  Development branch  A development branch or development tree of a piece of software is a version that is under development, and has not yet been officially released. In the open source community, the notion of release is typically metaphorical, since anyone can usually check out any desired version, whether it be in the development branch or not. Often, the version that will eventually become the next major version is called the development branch. However, there is often more than one subsequent version of the software under development at a given time. Some revision control systems have specific jargon for the main development branch; for example, in CVS, it is called the \\"MAIN\\"; in Git it is called the \\"master\\". A more generic term is \\"mainline\\".  Shadow or magic branches  In cvc and CVSNT, a shadow or magic branch \\"shadows\\" changes made in the upstream branch, to make it easier to maintain small changes (cvc is an open-source package building system incorporating a revision-control system for packages produced by rPath.)  Repository clones  In distributed revision control, the entire repository, with branches, may be copied and worked on further. Monotone (mtn), Mercurial (hg) and git call it \\"clone\\"; Bazaar calls it \\"branch\\".

She debuted on-screen during an episode that aired on 18 March 2005. Vinson originally auditioned for the role of Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon), but later secured the role of Cassie. She admitted it was a challenge to portray a character six years her junior who was still attending school. Cassie's backstory reveals that she was abused as a child by her uncle. However, her characterisation is out of conjunction with the usual victims of such crimes. She is portrayed as \\"fiercely independent and headstrong\\" female who has a knack for \\"winning friends and influencing people\\". Cassie is popular with the serial's male characters, while her allure also broadened off-screen to male viewers. Cassie is given a foster family when Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) and Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) take her into their home. Cassie has featured in various romance storylines; in one she begins a relationship with Macca MacKenzie (Trent Baines). The serial decided to portray as domestic abuse through the two characters. Cassie was seen pushing those closest to her away, while Macca continued his abuse. Vinson also visited females with the virus as part of the research process. The storyline was well received by carriers of the virus and Vinson said it was a \\"big moment\\" in her acting career. Vinson has received one Logie Award nomination for her portrayal of Cassie. In 2007, Vinson decided to leave Home and Away because of personal commitments. Cassie departed screens on 2 April 2008, when she left to go travelling. Character creation and casting Sharni Vinson appeared in Home and Away in 2001 and 2003, as guest characters named Tonya and Summer respectively. In 2004, Vinson's agent submitted her to audition for the role of Martha MacKenzie. Vinson received a re-call for the role and was also handed scripts for another character, Cassie Turner. However, fellow actress Jodi Gordon went on to secure the role of Martha. Vinson said she wanted to play Martha because she was characterised as a tomboy, a trait which Vinson attributes to herself. Soon after, Vinson signed up to play Cassie. Vinson was twenty one at the time, while Cassie was portrayed as a fifteen-year-old student. Vinson later described the experience as \\"such a stretch\\" because she \\"well out of school and then I was back into a school uniform, with the pigtails, no makeup, playing this real young character.\\" In her first few months on-screen, producers decided to cast Todd Lasance as Aden Jefferies. Aden was introduced as a new boyfriend for Cassie and was planned to heavily feature in her early storylines. Sharni Vinson (pictured) plays the \\"fiercely independent and headstrong\\" Cassie. In 2006, rival channel Network Ten tried to tempt Vinson into joining pop group Girlband, however she decided to stay in Home and Away. In July 2007, media outlets reported that Vinson wanted to quit the serial in order to pursue other projects in Los Angeles. In November that year it was confirmed that Vinson had quit Home and Away so she could move to Los Angeles to be with her boyfriend. However, the serial refused to comment on her departure because Cassie would still be seen on-screen into 2008. Vinson said she was happy that she got to play Cassie, because she enjoyed the work and portraying her storylines. By the time Vinson left, Cassie had appeared in a total of one hundred and three episodes. Character development =Characterisation= Cassie has been described as having a \\"fiercely independent and headstrong\\" persona. While she is able to learn from her mistakes and has a knack when it comes to \\"winning friends and influencing people\\". Cassie's independence and \\"strong-will\\" is attributed to her upbringing. After many problems in her childhood she was forced to live with her grandmother, Joy (Elaine Lee) after her mother abandoned her. She was the only family Cassie had and has been described as \\"devastated\\" when she died. Cassie has also been the victim of child abuse; this initially meant she was \\"deeply troubled\\". However counseling helped her to \\"learn how to live without anxiety.\\" Vinson told Yahoo!7 that Cassie is \\"mature\\" for a fifteen-year-old. As she has had to go through so much in her life, she \\"is older in the head than she realises\\". She also said that at the same time she can act \\"naive because she is young\\". In 2005, the characters of Cassie, Martha and Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans) were used by the Seven Network to promote their clothing range. The characters were seen on-screen dressed in items from their clothing line. =Domestic violence= Trent Baines (pictured) plays Cassie's violent love interest, Macca.In one storyline Cassie begins a relationship with Macca MacKenzie (Trent Baines), which turns violent when Macca starts to hit her. Cassie initially leaves Macca, but decides she loves him and dates him in secret. Those closest to Cassie are ashamed of her when they discover the truth. Female First opined that Cassie \\"cried her heart out\\" and \\"wished the whole world would just swallow her up\\" because of her dilemma. The publication also felt that there was nothing Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) could do to help Cassie, because she herself would not admit the truth. After being assaulted by Macca, he convinces her to leave her family and friends behind and move away with him. The Daily Record said that Macca had \\"hardly been the ideal boyfriend\\" and said it wasn't hard to see why Cassie had doubts about leaving with him. Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) tries to help Cassie, but she proves \\"stubborn\\" and decides to leave with Macca. He uncharacteristically warns Sally that she is in danger of losing her foster daughter for good. They said it was the first point in the storyline that Macca did a \\"mature, sensible thing\\". Five said that Macca would \\"trash her as soon as he looked at her\\". They opined that they were sure she would realise the truth about him in the end. They also hoped that other residents would listen to her. As the storyline came to a conclusion, Cassie finally became brave enough to leave Macca. However, he tracked her down and hit her again. =HIV= Cassie was later involved in a notable storyline in which she contracts HIV from Henk Van Patten (Damian De Montemas). Home and Away producers first informed Vinson about the HIV storyline in mid-2007. They also asked for her opinion on the development. Vinson was initially worried about the serial's early timeslot on the Seven Network, coupled with the \\"intense\\" nature of the storyline. However, she changed her mind upon receiving the scripts because she thought they were well written. When the storyline was screened, Vinson explained that Cassie is \\"in love, engaged and expecting a baby\\" so she thinks her life \\"couldn't be more fantastic\\". When Cassie discovers she is HIV positive, she feels as though she has hit \\"the bottom of the barrel\\" and knows that \\"her life's changed forever\\". Vinson added that after, Cassie finds the situation \\"incomprehensible\\" and cannot \\"understand\\" what has been told. She goes \\"numb\\" and is \\"overcome with shock\\". Cassie cannot cope with her \\"nightmare\\" and rushes out into the street, \\"straight into the path of an oncoming car\\". Cassie is then rushed to hospital following being run over and viewers were kept guessing as to whether her baby would survive. The storyline was the first that Vinson \\"actually bothered\\" to go out and research. Vinson and her drama coach visited hospitals to meet with HIV positive females. Vinson received letters from HIV positive people, praising her portrayal of the issue. The moment that Cassie discovers she has the virus was well received by viewers. Vinson said that the feedback had made her \\"happy\\" and that playing the scenario was a \\"big moment\\" for herself as an actor. In early 2008, Cassie's exit storyline reported in the media over two months before she was due to depart. It was revealed that Cassie would leave to travel the world with Sally, before the birth of her daughter. Storylines Cassie meets Ric while jet-skiing, it soon becomes clear she stole the vehicle and they escape the owner. She meets Ric once again and they go skinny dipping at the beach. Cassie steals his clothes and forces him to go home naked. Cassie attends the \\"Miss Groper\\" pageant where her grandmother, Joy is taking part. When she does not win, she gets into an argument with Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood), collapses and later dies. Cassie's uncle turns up, but she has flashbacks from her childhood where it is revealed he used to abuse her. He is reported to the police and Sally and Flynn decided to take Cassie into their home. Cassie becomes close to Ric, who is also fostered by Sally and Flynn. Their sexual tension becomes too much, but when it came to sleeping together, Cassie has flashbacks of her uncle Ben (Craig Elliot) abuse and subsequently breaks up with Ric. Cassie starts dating Aden and Ric becomes jealous of their relationship. Ric tackles Aden during a football match, so Aden's brother, Sean (Gabriel Egan) attacks Ric, causing Cassie to dump Aden and later gets back with Ric. Cassie is distraught when she discovers that Flynn is dying from cancer. She cannot cope with him wanting to end his life and goes on a rampage during a cyclone. She becomes trapped with Ric when an electricity cable falls on them. Sally and Flynn rescue them, but are electrocuted in doing so. Although they survive, Flynn later dies from his tumor and Cassie finds it hard to cope with his death. When Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) arrives in Summer Bay, she feels threatened by her friendship with Ric and dumps him. She then meets Martha's adoptive brother, Macca and starts to date him. Their romance faces problems when she complains about not being able to see him often and the effect his prescription medication has on him. After more arguments Macca hits Cassie and she decides to forgive him, but reconciles with Ric after he dumps Belle. However, Belle still wants Ric so she convinces Cassie to tutor Drew Curtis (Bobby Morley), while she unsuccessfully attempted to steal Ric back. Ric attends a mechanical course in the city, while Macca returns claiming to have overcome his anger issues. Cassie realises she still has feelings for Macca and gets back together with him. When Ric finds out she has cheated, Cassie decides to move out of her home despite Sally telling her that she does not want her to go and stay with Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). Macca later receives a job offer in the city and asks Cassie to move with him. After an argument with Sally, Cassie decides to take up his offer. Macca feels bad and tells Sally that she should fight for Cassie; however she does not listen to Sally's pleas and moves. Cassie visits Summer Bay as much as she can; however her visits annoy Macca who begins to beat her up again. After a few more assaults, Cassie feels she has to move back home, but agrees to continue their relationship. Macca tracks her down and hits her again, before handing himself into the police. Cassie decides to start at a charity helpline for domestic abuse victims. Brad Armstrong (Chris Sadrinna) helps her set the charity up and Dan Baker (Tim Campbell) acts as a counsellor. Cassie's first caller for help, Lily Nelson (Kathryn Beck) intrigues Cassie, who then meets up with her.

However, Cassie refuses to believe it and begins a serious relationship with him. Henk later comes bored and dumps Cassie. She later attends a party with Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans) and where Aden is smoking marijuana. Cassie drives them home despite drinking; when Aden distracts her she crashes the car and is arrested for drunk driving. Henk returns to support Cassie, who is let off with her offence. Cassie discovers that she is pregnant and she and Henk decide to get married. Cassie takes a blood test and discovers that she has contracted HIV from Henk. She runs out of the surgery and is run over by an oncoming car. Although she recovers, Henk leaves her once again and Rachel supports her through her troubles. When Henk returns to win Cassie back, she refuses and tells him she needs to be alone. Aden has to take a HIV test after he got Cassie's blood on her in the crash, but the test returns negative but refuses to forgive Cassie. She is heartbroken when Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Cassie he wants nothing to do with her because she has HIV. Colleen also voices her prejudice by implying she may infect Sally's baby. They both later apologize when Cassie raises awareness of the virus and gains everyone's support. Sally suggests that Cassie goes travelling with her, which she accepts. Cassie decides to have one last road trip with her best friend, Matilda and travel by car. Cassie feels her baby kick for the first time and waves goodbye to the town's residents as she leaves for her new life. Reception For her portrayal of Cassie, Vinson was nominated in the category of \\"Most Popular New Female Talent\\" at the 2006 Logie Awards. Soap opera magazine Inside Soap said that whenever fictional characters are happy, \\"disaster lurks around the corner\\". They opined that it was \\"no surprise\\" that Cassie's world \\"came crashing down\\" when she discovers she is HIV positive. The Birmingham Mail chose the moment that Cassie realised Jules fancied her as their \\"pick of the day\\". A columnist for the Sunday Mirror said that Cassie \\"set pulses racing\\" and branded her a \\"sexy soap siren\\". They also opined that Vinson herself was a \\"sexy Home & Away starlet\\" and that her departure was \\"bad news\\" and \\"disappointing\\" for men who watch the serial. While the Daily Record opined that Cassie's actions over Lily were always set to lead her into trouble. While they acknowledged that she is a \\"well-meaning teen\\", they felt that by going to such lengths to save one caller in-turn endangered \\"the future\\" of the helpline charity.

In 1414 Bremgarten gained the right to low justice in the village, a right that it held until 1797. After 1415, Zurich exerted the rights to high justice over the Kelleramt, including Islisberg. Between 1360 and 1370 a chapel is mentioned in the village. This chapel was dedicated in 1937 to St. Anthony of Padua. The Catholic residents belong to the parish of Lunkhofen while the Reformed residents belong to the Bremgarten-Mutschellen parish.

Used in this context, currency means the coin and/or paper money of any country that is designated as legal tender by the country of issuance. Currency also includes U.S. silver certificates, U.S. notes, Federal Reserve notes, and official foreign bank notes.  History  When the first version of the CTR was introduced, the only way a suspicious transaction less than $10,000 was reported to the government was if a bank teller called law enforcement. This was primarily due to the financial industry's concern about the right to financial privacy. The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to report currency transaction amounts of over $10,000.  Procedure  When a transaction involving more than $10,000 in cash is processed, most banks have a system that automatically creates a CTR electronically. Tax and other information about the customer is usually pre-filled by the bank software. CTRs since 1996 include an optional checkbox at the top if the bank employee believes the transaction to be suspicious or fraudulent, commonly called a SAR, or Suspicious Activity Referral. A customer is not directly told about the $10,000 threshold unless they initiate the inquiry. A customer may decline to continue the transaction upon being informed about the CTR, but this would require the bank employee to file a SAR. Once a customer presents or asks to withdraw more than $10,000 in currency, the decision to continue the transaction must continue as originally requested and may not be reduced to avoid the filing of a CTR. For instance, if a customer reneges on their initial request to deposit or withdraw more than $10,000 in cash, and instead requests the same transaction for $9,999, the bank employee should deny such a request and continue the transaction as originally requested by filing a CTR. This sort of attempt is known as structuring, and is punishable by federal law against both the customer and the bank employee. Those who habitually run transactions just under the $10,000 threshold will likely subject themselves to scrutiny and/or the filing of a SAR.

Early studies and career Alfred Tozzer was born in Lynn, Massachusetts to Samuel Clarence (1846‚Äì1908) and Caroline (n√©e Marston, 1847‚Äì1926) Tozzer, and graduated in Anthropology from Harvard University in 1900. That summer he entered field as an assistant to Harvard's Roland Dixon to study American Indian languages of California. The following year he collected linguistic and ethnographic data on the Navajos living near Pueblo Bonito in New Mexico. From these experiences he published his first paper, which he presented at the Thirteenth International Congress of Americanists held in New York in 1902. In December 1901, he won appointment as a Traveling Fellow for the Archeological Institute of America. He spent several seasons in Yucat√°n conducting fieldwork among the Maya. He began at the Hacienda Chichen, owned by U.S. Consul to Yucat√°n Edward H. Thompson, a large plantation that included the ancient city of Chichen Itza. There he studied the Maya language and traveled the countryside collecting folk tales and oral histories. During one of his seasons at Chichen Itza he helped Thompson dredge the Cenote Sagrado; at the end of another, he carried artifacts to the Peabody Museum in his luggage.Mary McVicker, Adela Breton: A Victorian Artist Amid Mexico's Ruins (University of New Mexico Press, 2005) In 1903, Tozzer traveled to Campeche and Chiapas to conduct research among the Lacandon Maya, and lived for several weeks in a small settlement on Lake Peth√°, witnessing and even participating in their ceremonies. He returned there during the 1904 season. He wrote his PhD dissertation comparing the ceremonies of the Lacondone Maya with the Yucatecan Maya. In the fall of 1904, he studied at Columbia University under Franz Boas and Adolph Bandelier. He spent one more season in Yucat√°n, Campeche and Chiapas, before settling at Harvard in the fall of 1905 as an assistant professor of anthropology. Transition to archaeologist Black vulture and snake from a Maya codexFrom the beginning of his professional career, Tozzer began to shift more to archaeology and away from ethnography. During his seasons at Chichen, he assisted Adela Breton with her copies of reliefs, and Thompson who was making paper molds. During his time with the Lacandons he discovered and explored ruins that today share the name of the Rio Tzendales. In the summer of 1907, he joined Dixon, Alfred Kidder and Sylvanus Morley on a purely archaeological expedition to Rito de los Frijoles in New Mexico (today part of Bandelier National Monument). In 1910 he took a leave of absence from Harvard to lead his first expedition to the ruins of Tikal and Nakum on behalf of the university's Peabody Museum.‚ÄúPreliminary study of the prehistoric ruins of Tikal, Guatemala, Report of the Peabody Museum Expedition, 1909‚Äì1910‚Äù (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Memoirs of the Peabody Museum 5, No. 2:93‚Äì135, 1910) On this trip Tozzer discovered the ruins of Holmul. In 1914 Tozzer took another leave of absence to succeed Boas as director of the International School of American Archeology and Ethnology in Mexico. He arrived in Veracruz in time to witness the US Navy shelling of the city. He oversaw excavation of the Toltec site at Santiago Ahuitzotla. Once his term as director expired, he never ventured into the field again.S.K. Lothrop, ‚ÄúAlfred Marston Tozzer 1876‚Äì1954‚Äù (American Anthropologist, 57:614‚Äì618, 1955) Tozzer eventually returned to Harvard where he would spend the remainder of his professional career, except for stints in the military. He served as a captain in the Air Service from 1917 to 1918. He served as a major in the Reserves from 1918 to 1929. During World War II, he served as director of the Honolulu office of the Office of Strategic Services from 1943 to 1945. Later career Tozzer returned from World War I to his post as associate professor at Harvard. Within three years he was a full professor and chairman of the Division of Anthropology. In 1922, Tozzer won appointment to the Academic Board at Radcliffe College, and later become a trustee in 1928. He served on Harvard's Administrative Board from 1928 until his retirement in 1948. Tozzer published several important works in Maya studies, among them, A Grammar of the Maya language, and an annotated translation of Bishop Diego de Landa's Relaci√≥n de las cosas de Yucat√°n. His magnum opus, Chichen Itza and its Cenote of Sacrifice (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Memoirs of the Peabody Museum, 1957), was published after his death in 1954.

She was the daughter of John Brigantine and Alice Squire, who conspired to have her husband, Thomas Arden of Faversham, murdered so she could carry on with a long-term affair with a tailor, Richard Moseby. The murder took place on 14 February 1551. She was tried, convicted, and burnt at the stake for her part in the murder.  Conspirators  The murder was described by Raphael Holinshed in his Chronicles and later had entries in both The Newgate Calendar and the Chambers Book of Days. Alice Brigantine married Thomas Arden on an unknown date. They made their home at Faversham Abbey, which had been dissolved in 1536. They had at least one daughter, Margaret, who was born in 1538. According to these accounts, Alice was \\"young, tall, and well favoured of shape and countenance\\". She began an affair with a tailor, Richard Mosbye, and then she plotted to kill her husband. Thomas Arden was a \\"private gentleman\\". His rival Mosbye (or \\"Mosbie\\") was in the service of Edward North, 1st Baron North, before setting up shop in London.Chambers Book of Days: \\"Arden of Feversham\\"The Newgate Calendar: \\"Alice Arden of Feversham\\" Mosbye frequented the house of the Ardens and the affair was carried on rather openly. Thomas had to turn a blind eye, unwilling to sever relations with Alice's family. In time Alice came to loathe her husband and considered disposing of him. She made an early attempt on his life by poisoning him. She mixed milk and poison within a porringer, serving it to Thomas for breakfast. She had failed to account for the taste of the poison used. Thomas only took \\"a spoonful or two\\" before quitting his breakfast and complaining of its quality. Alice had to find an accomplice for her further efforts. Holinshed simply mentions: \\"They employed as their confederates one John Green, a Faversham tailor; George Bradshaw, a goldsmith of the same town; and one Black Will, of Calyce (Calais), a murderer, which murderer was privily sent for to Calyce by the earnest sute, appoyntment, and confederate of Alice Arden and Thomas Mosbye.\\" The Newgate Calendar gives a more extensive account. She found her accomplice in the person of Mr. Green, a local man who had personal grievances with Thomas Arden. Green had claimed a piece of land on the back side of Faversham Abbey. Arden claimed the vicinity of his residence as part of his own property, successfully wresting control of Green's land. The two men had exchanged blows and threats before. Green still hated his enemy and was willing to work for his murder. Since both were inexperienced in the art of murder, they decided to hire someone else to do the deed, resolving to pay the mercenary ten pounds for the completed murder. Green was employed by Sir Anthony Agers. Agers had business in London. He was already there for a while before asking Green to join him there. Green was reluctant to travel alone and hired Mr. Bradshaw to accompany him. Bradshaw was a local goldsmith and veteran soldier, having served under Sir Richard Cavendish during the Sieges of Boulogne. In their travel they chanced on an old acquaintance of Bradshaw, known as \\"Black Will\\". Will was also a veteran soldier but one who had committed \\"several robberies and horrid murders\\" in France. Armed \\"with a sword and buckler\\", Will was apparently making his living as a highwayman since leaving military service. Green decided he had found his mercenary, hiring Will for the murder.  Failed attempts  Holinshed mentions a number of failed attempts on Thomas's life. \\"The conspirators watched Master Arden walking in Poule‚Äôs (St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, the nave of which was a public promenade in those days), but could not find an opportunity to murder him; they then lay in wait for him on Rainham Down, and a second time in the Broomy Close (two places near Faversham), but on all these occasions failed in obtaining an opportunity.\\" Rainham Down probably being Rainham on the North Downs. The Newgate Calendar again expands on the basic narrative. Black Will followed Green to London. The duo soon met Thomas Arden who had traveled there for his own purposes. Green used a walk to Old St Paul's Cathedral to have Will take a close look at his intended victim. Arden was accompanied by a servant called Michael or Marry who was loyal to Alice. Green wanted to use the servant to gain access to Arden's lodgings in London. Black Will offered to kill both master and servant instead. Green informed the servant of this threat to his own life. This backfired. The servant was terrified of Black Will, making sure to bolt the doors of their lodgings at night, preventing Will or anyone else from entering. An attempt to ambush Arden on his return journey also failed. The servant pretended that his horse went lame, having Arden travel alone. Instead, Arden convinced various acquaintances to travel with him, never actually being isolated enough for Will to ambush him. Arden returned home safely. Arden had business with Thomas Cheney, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in South-East England. He had his servant travel to the Isle of Sheppey and meet Cheney. The servant returned with a letter from Cheney. Alice concealed the letter and had the servant claim to have lost it. This had the intended effect. Thomas decided to travel to the Isle of Sheppey and meet Cheney in person. Black Will and George Shakebag, a fellow highwayman, were instructed by Alice to ambush him on his way there \\"in a broom-close between Feversham and the Ferry\\". Unfamiliar with the area, the highwaymen set their ambush at the wrong location, failing to meet Arden either at his journey to the Isle or on his return. Another idea to accomplish the deed was stillborn. Valentine's Day was approaching and there would be a fair. Moseby would have to pick a fight with Thomas in public and then end the life of his rival in a duel. With Thomas's known reluctance to fight, the idea of him accepting a challenge was deemed absurd.  Murder  Holinshed continues: \\"The wicked wife then laid a plot for murdering her husband in his own house. She procured the services of Mosbye‚Äôs sister, Cicely Pounder, and of two of Arden‚Äôs domestic servants, Michael Saunderson and Elizabeth Stafford. On a particular day selected Sunday, Black Will was hidden in a closet at the end of Arden‚Äôs parlour. After supper, Arden sat down to play some kind of game with Mosbye; Green stood at Arden‚Äôs back, holding a candle in his hand, to shaddowe Black Will when he should come out; and the other conspirators had their cue. At a given signal in the game, Black Will came with a napkyn in his hand, and suddenly came behind Arden‚Äôs back, threw the said napkyn over his hedd and face, and strangled him; and forthwith Mosbye stept to him, and strake him with a taylor‚Äôs great pressing iron upon the scull to the braine, and immediately drew out his dagger, which was groat and broad, and therewith cut the said Arden‚Äôs throat.\\" Alice herself stabbed the body seven or eight times. Will helped drag the body into the closet. He then received eight pounds for his services. Cicely Pounder later helped transferring the body to the Almery Croft, a meadow behind the house. Finishing the task, \\"the doubly wicked Alice and her companions danced, and played on the virginals, and were merrie.\\" All this noise had a purpose. They wanted to have the neighbours think that Thomas Arden was still alive and entertaining friends. The corpse dressed in night-clothes would convince them of the hour of its death. From here, the Newgate Calendar account diverges considerably. At last, Alice and her fellow conspirators decided to kill Thomas within the walls of their house. She arranged for most of their servants to be sent on various tasks outside the residence, \\"except those who were privy and consenting to the villainous design\\". She had Black Will hide in a closet located at the parlour of the residence, waiting for a pre- arranged signal to come out. At about 7 p.m, Thomas returned home to find Moseby already there. He was told their supper was not ready yet. The two men agreed to a game of backgammon while waiting for Alice to call them. The two men were in the parlour, with Arden having his back turned to the closet. Moseby kept him distracted until voicing the signal \\"Now I may take you, Sir!\\". Will rushed from the closet and started strangling their victim with a towel. Moseby struck Arden with a fourteen-pound pressing iron. He was knocked out. The two men then transferred their victim to his counting house. There, Will finished him. Will stole the money from the corpse's pockets and stripped it of its rings. Alice paid him his ten pounds and Green provided him with a horse to make his escape. Alice, to make certain that her husband was indeed dead, stabbed him seven or eight times. Then she had the parlour cleaned and the blood wiped away with a cloth. The bloody knife and cloth were then discarded. When everything was prepared, guests started arriving for a delayed supper. They included Moseby's sister, Cicely. Alice feigned ignorance at the reasons her husband was taking so long to return home. \\"When supper was over, Mrs Arden made her daughter play on the virginals, and they danced, and she amongst them.\\" Alice made sure to keep her guests around as long as possible while constantly reminding them of the suspicious absence of her spouse. Then she sent most of the servants out to look for their master. Meanwhile, Alice, her daughter Margaret Arden, Cicely Pounder and the maid Elizabeth Stafford would transport the corpse outside the house. They \\"carried it out into a field adjoining to the churchyard, and to his own garden wall, through which he went to church.\\" They laid it down \\"about ten paces from the door of that garden\\", making it seem that Thomas was murdered outside.  Discovery  According to Hollinshed, Alice waited until the following morning to alert the town that her husband went missing. The towns-people conducted a search and the corpse was discovered. \\"Some of the people saw a 'long rushe or two from the parlour floor there were no carpets in those days, stuck between one of his slippers and his foot. Suspicion being aroused, the house was searched, and it was soon found that Arden had been murdered in his own parlour.' Very likely Alice‚Äôs conduct as a wife had already attracted public attention; for she was at once accused of the murder.\\" The Newgate Calendar gives a rather different account. That night, Alice made a show of her supposed worry for her spouse's disappearance. She had her servants search for him late into the night, wept and lamented, alerted the neighbours. At last the local mayor was informed and a town-wide search was contacted. When the corpse was discovered, the people involved with the search started doubting the innocence of Alice. It was a cold winter night and there was fresh snow on the ground, but the body was only dressed in \\"its night-gown and slippers\\", making it seem unlikely that he was going about his business in town when killed. The fresh snow had preserved footprints of several people in the distance between the location of the body and the residence of the Ardens, making it plain the body had been transported from the house to its current position. Suspicions immediately fell on Alice. She was confronted by the mayor and \\"very strictly examined\\" on the murder of her husband. She initially denied any knowledge of the deed. But the people of the town conducted further searches near the house, discovering hair and blood of the victim, the bloody knife and the cloth, which was discarded but poorly hidden. Alice was at length forced to confess to her guilt, while also naming her associates. The two Arden ladies (mother and daughter), the servant and the maid were immediately arrested and sent to prison. Moseby was not present. He was found sleeping at the \\"Flower- de-Luce\\" (fleur-de-lis), the house of Adam Fowle, which he frequented. With blood found on his stockings and coin purse, this conspirator was also arrested. A bit more controversial was the arrest of Bradshaw. He was mentioned in the correspondence between Alice and Green as the man who introduced them to Black Will. The goldsmith was then accused of being a \\"procurer of Black Will\\". He was otherwise unconnected to the case. The rest of the accused claimed to have never even met the man, much less conversed or conspired with him, but his protests of innocence failed to convince the court.  Execution  Alice Arden was found guilty of the crime of murder (Petty treason) and burnt at the stake in Canterbury. Her co-conspirators were all rounded up and executed by various means and at different locations. Michael Saunderson was drawn and hanged. or hanged in chains at Feversham. Elizabeth Stafford, the maid, was burned at the stake in Faversham. Richard Mosbye and Cicely Pounder, brother and sister, were hanged at Smithfield, George Bradshaw was hanged in chains at Canterbury. There are two accounts given on the fate of John Green. Hollinshed simply mentions that Green was hung at Faversham. The Newgate Calendar has him evading arrest for some years. He was eventually caught and \\"hanged in chains in the highway between Ospringe and Boughton\\". Before he died, Green attempted to clear the name of Bradshaw proclaiming the innocence of the long-dead goldsmith. Black Will ended his life on a scaffold. Holinshed mentions that Will \\"escaped for many years, but was at length taken, and 'brent on a scaffolde at Flushing'\\". This could be Flushing, Cornwall. The Newgate Calendar agrees on the manner of death but places the execution at Flushing, Zeeland. Adam Fowle was also implicated and incarcerated for some time at Marshalsea. He alone was found innocent and discharged.  Aftermath  Chambers Book of Days mentions the event entering local legend. \\"It was long said that no grass would grow on the spot where Arden‚Äôs dead body was found; some, in accordance with the superstitions of the times, attributed this to the murder; while others declared that 'the field he hadde cruelly taken from a widow woman, who had curst him most bitterly, even to his face, wishing that all the world might wonder on him.' \\" In 1592, the events were dramatized in the play Arden of Faversham. The paternity of the play has been long disputed, with William Shakespeare being the most prominent of the candidates, and Thomas Watson purported to be the main author in 2020. The play was later adapted by George Lillo into a domestic tragedy. Alice Arden's story was also adapted into a broadside ballad, \\"The complaint and lamentation of Mistresse Arden of Feversham in Kent\\".Facsimiles and recordings of the ballad can be found on the English Broadside Ballad Archive.

Research activity in England and Romania After completing lyceum at Saint Sava High School, he went to study at the University of Berlin. He obtained his doctorate in Chemistry in 1887, with thesis \\"About some derivatives of phenyl methacrylic acid and phenyl isobutyric acid\\" written under the direction of August Wilhelm von Hofmann. After that, Edeleanu worked for some time at the Royal College of Artillery in London as a lecturer and as an assistant to Professor Hodgkinson. During this period, he collaborated with Charles Frederick Cross and Edward John Bevan to create a certain type of artificial fireproof silk. With Raphael Meldola he created oxazine-based dyes. Back in Romania, he was hired by the chemist Constantin I. Istrati as an assistant and then as a lecturer at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Sciences. in the Organic Chemistry Department. In 1906 he was appointed Head of the Chemistry Laboratory at the Geology Institute, founded that year, and director of Vega Refinery near Ploie»ôti, a refinery owned at that time by the German company Diskont). In 1907, along with Ion TƒÉnƒÉsescu, he co-organized the Petroleum Congress in Bucharest and co-authored a monograph on the physical and technical properties of Romanian crude oil. His most significant invention, was the Edeleanu process (1908). It is a process in which petroleum is refined with liquid sulfur dioxide to selectively extract aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene, etc.). The procedure was first applied experimentally in Romania at the Vega Refinery and later spread to France (notably Rouen), Germany, and subsequently throughout the world. Research and business in Germany In 1910, Edeleanu settled in Germany where he founded a company called \\"Allgemeine Gesellschaft f√ºr Chemische Industrie\\". Due to the success of the name \\"Edeleanu\\", the company changed its name to Edeleanu GmbH in 1930. During the Nazi regime, it was bought by the Deutsche Erd√∂l-AG. Several ownership changes later it was acquired by Uhde GmbH in 2002, which is owned by the Thyssenkrupp trust. The name Edeleanu is still used for the refinery department until this day. Edeleanu returned to Romania, where he died in Bucharest in April 1941. Heritage By 1960, there were 80 Edeleanu facilities worldwide. The Edeleanu Method is still used today, in its many variations, and remains the basic process for manufacturing high quality oils. Edeleanu obtained 212 patents for inventions in Romania, the United States, Germany, France, Austria, Sweden, and Holland.

A \\"complete edition\\" of the game will be released for arcades and later consoles in the future.Gematsu: The Fallen Angels complete edition announced for console, arcade Gameplay Fallen Angels is a two dimensional fighting game that takes a somewhat realistic approach in its gameplay, with no supernatural attacks and fluid movements animated using real motions. Projectile attacks are limited to three characters, atypical for the game's genre. The game featured eight playable characters: Cool, Harry Ness, Yuiren, Yuiran, Tar≈ç, Torao Onigawara, Ruccio Roche, Haiji Mibu. The boss characters are Trigger and Carlos. Screenshot of The Fallen Angels Plot  The game takes place in 2010, ten years after a massive earthquake that shook an unnamed city. The earthquake severed the city from its surrounding areas, leaving criminals to run as they please. The game revolves around the inhabitants fighting against one another to accomplish their goals. Development Information about the game's development and fate are scarce, though it is widely reported that it was released without being completed. The developers of the game then reportedly moved back to SNK, supported by the observation that many of the characters bear striking resemblances to fighters that later appeared in SNK's The King of Fighters series and Garou: Mark of the Wolves. Game director Mitsuo Kodama was unhappy that the game's style influenced other rival companies (who left to found K2 LLC, later acquired by Capcom) In The King of Fighters '99, the boss character Krizalid resembles one of the characters and has a theme song titled \\"Dear Falling Angel\\". Unfinished sprites for four unplayable characters have been found in the ROMs of the game, speculating that they were meant to be playable characters. They consisted of a female treasure hunter, a shirtless male brawler, a businessman, and a naked male with no genitals. The upcoming complete version of the game will feature the four unused characters, along with many adjustments.

The tube is about 10cm long. An isopycnic surface is a surface of constant density inside a fluid. Isopycnic surfaces contrast with isobaric or isothermal surfaces, which describe surfaces of constant pressure and constant temperature respectively. Isopycnic surfaces are sometimes referred to as \\"iso-density\\" surfaces, although this is strictly incorrect. Isopycnic typically describes surfaces, not processes. Unless there is a flux of mass into or out of a control volume, a process which occurs at a constant density also occurs at a constant volume and is called an isochoric process and not an isopycnic process. The term \\"isopycnic\\" is commonly encountered in the fluid dynamics of compressible fluids, such as in meteorology and geophysical fluid dynamics, astrophysics, or the fluid dynamics of explosions or high Mach number flows. It may also be applied to other situations where a continuous medium has smoothly varying density, such as in the case of an inhomogeneous colloidal suspension. In general isopycnic surfaces will occur in fluids in hydrostatic equilibrium coinciding with equipotential surfaces formed by gravity. The term \\"isopycnic\\" is also encountered in biophysical chemistry, usually in reference to a process of separating particles, subcellular organelles, or other substances on the basis of their density. Isopycnic centrifugation refers to a method wherein a density gradient is either pre-formed or forms during high speed centrifugation. After this gradient is formed particles move within the gradient to the position having a density matching their own (this is in fact an incorrect description of the exact physical process but does describe the result in a meaningful way). This technique is extremely powerful. In geology, isopycnic surfaces occur especially in connection with cratons which are very old geologic formations at the core of the continents, little affected by tectonic events. These formations are often known as shields or platforms. These formations are, relative to other lithospheric formations, cooler and less dense but much more isopycnic.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 26 September 2002. Foell departed on 21 March 2003, but her character subsequently appeared as a ghost in her daughter's dreams on 24 May 2004. Storylines Angie arrives in Summer Bay to take on the position of Deputy Principal and meets her former flame Rhys Sutherland (Michael Beckley). Her son, Dylan (Brett Hicks-Maitland) immediately takes a shine to Rhys' daughter Kirsty (Christie Hayes). Angie later drops a massive bombshell, revealing that Dylan is Rhys' son from their relationship, sending shockwaves through the Sutherland family. Rhys' marriage to Shelley (Paula Forrest) gradually breaks down. In the midst of this, Angie begins a relationship with recently released Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin) and even lies to Detective Mike Carter (Stephen Leeder) about Jesse's whereabouts on the night of a murder. Angie begins playing mind games with Nick when she catches him fighting with Dylan. Angie uses her feminine wiles to seduce Nick and then rejects him. When Nick confronts her in a classroom one day, Angie starts screaming and tearing at her clothing, and Nick is framed for sexual assault as a result. Even after she dropped the charges, the police still pursue Nick. Justice Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances), has prior information about a scandal Angie had been involved in at her nephew Duncan's (Brendan McKensy) school in the city where Angie had taught and seduced one of her students, Stephen Ross (Oliver Ackland) but it backfires when Angie takes a defamation of character suit against Morag and Stephen lies on the stand in the belief that he and Angie will be together. Nick is then tried and found guilty of and sentenced to community service at a retirement home. The Bay then turns on Angie, resulting in her becoming more and more unstable. She torches Scott Hunter's boatshed and blackmails Josh West (Daniel Collopy) over his dealing with a local councillor. Toward the end of Angie's reign of terror over Summer Bay, Angie discovers Dylan is not Rhys' son and worse was to come when Nick with the help of Kirsty, her sister Jade (Kate Garven) and Seb Miller (Mitch Firth) and gains a measure of revenge by videoing Angie threatening Nick. Following this, Angie's employment is terminated by Principal Paris Burnett (Rhett Giles) Several weeks later, Angie's body is found and the suspect list includes Dylan, the Sutherlands, Nick, Josh, Jesse, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) and Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). They are all questioned and the police are convinced Rhys is the murderer, but as they are about to formally charge him with Angie's murder Dylan confesses to arguing with Angie then pushing her, resulting in her death when her head struck the edge of a table. Dylan stands trial in the city and is acquitted. Angie later appears in her daughter Tasha Andrews' (Isabel Lucas) dream as a ghost. Reception Writer David Dale for The Age described Angie as a \\"Supreme Super-bitch\\" in his article about the serial. He also opined the decision to kill her was a tactic to help Channel 7 gain ratings against the impending return of Nine Network's Big Brother. and likened Angie's killing off to the axing of Geoff Hill, the then-managing director of Sydney's branch of seven. Dale added \\"Angie's sin, by contrast, was that she was too interesting. Knocking her off was the most powerful way to hang on to Home and Away viewers who might have been getting a bit jaded after 15 years of sun, surf and teenage angst.\\" The ratings for the serial rose to 1.7 million viewers for the episode where Angie's body was discovered. The revelation of Angie's killer and the aftermath raised audience figures in Australia to 1.5 million viewers, beating the Nine Network's Big Brother.

This deformation from a trigonal planar geometry to a tetrahedral molecular geometry is the result of angle strain induced in the molecule due to geometric constraints. Pyramidal alkenes only exist in the laboratory but are of interest because much can be learned from them about the nature of chemical bonding. In cycloheptene (1.1) the cis isomer is an ordinary unstrained molecule, but the heptane ring is too small to accommodate a trans-configured alkene group resulting in strain and twisting of the double bond. The p-orbital misalignment is minimized by a degree of pyramidalization. In the related anti-Bredt molecules. it is not pyrimidalization but twisting that dominates. :Figure 1. Pyramidal alkenes Pyramidalized cage alkenes also exist where symmetrical bending of the substituents predominates without p-orbital misalignment. :Figure 2. Angle definitions The pyramidalization angle œÜ (b) is defined as the angle between the plane defined by one of the doubly bonded carbons and its two substituents and the extension of the double bond and is calculated as: :\\\\cos \\\\varphi = - \\\\frac {\\\\cos(\\\\angle \\\\mathrm{RCC})} {\\\\cos(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\angle \\\\mathrm{RCR})} the butterfly bending angle or folding angle œà (c) is defined as the angle between two planes and can be obtained by averaging the two torsional angles R1C=CR3 and R2C=CR4. In alkenes 1.2 and 1.3 these angles are determined with X-ray crystallography as respectively 32.4¬∞/22.7¬∞ and 27.3¬∞/35.6¬∞. Although stable, these alkenes are very reactive compared to ordinary alkenes. They are liable to dimerization to cyclobutadiene compounds or react with oxygen to epoxides. The compound tetradehydrodianthracene, also with a 35¬∞ pyramidalization angle, is synthesized in a photochemical cycloaddition of bromoanthracene followed by elimination of hydrogen bromide. :Figure 3. Tetradehydrodianthracene synthesis This compound is very reactive in Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions due to through-space interactions between the two alkene groups. This enhanced reactivity enabled in turn the synthesis of the first-ever M√∂bius aromat. In one study, the strained alkene 4.4 was synthesized with the highest pyramidalizion angles yet, 33.5¬∞ and 34.3¬∞. This compound is the double Diels‚ÄìAlder adduct of the diiodocyclophane 4.1 and anthracene 4.3 by reaction in presence of potassium tert-butoxide in refluxing dibutyl ether through a diaryne intermediate 4.2. This is a stable compound but will slowly react with oxygen to an epoxide when left standing as a chloroform solution. :Figure 4. Cyclophane anthracene adduct In one study, isolation of a pyramidal alkene is not even possible by matrix isolation at extremely low temperatures unless stabilized by metal coordination: :Figure 5.

He soon became known for his distinctive covers: examples include the covers to Mask Comics #1, Mask Comics #2 (Rural Home), Contact Comics #12, and Captain Flight Comics #11 (Four Star Publications). An avid science fiction fan, Cole was known for slipping in sci-fi elements even when they weren't appropriate, such as rocket ships and ray guns appearing on the covers of Captain Flight Comics and Contact Comics.Cole biography, Lambiek's Comiclopedia (Both titles were supposed to be devoted to contemporary aviation.) During this time, Cole created the character \\"Wiggles the wonderworm\\" who appeared in five issues of Taffy Comics, published by Rural Home/Orbit Publications. Great Comics 1 (1945) Cover art by L. B. Cole From 1942‚Äì1948, Cole ran his own comics studio, often packaging work for a variety of publishers. In 1949, publisher Novelty Press sold its characters and artwork to Cole, who was the cover artist for Novelty's Blue Bolt Comics.Markstein, Don. \\"Blue Bolt,\\" Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Retrieved July 11, 2008. Using his new assets, Cole began Star Publications, which operated from 1949 to 1955. After the closure of Star, Cole continued doing cover illustrations, many for Classics Illustrated Junior. In the early 1960s, Cole was art director and editor at Dell Comics. From the mid-1960s through the 1970s, Cole created instructional materials and audio-visuals for University Films. He gained further recognition when comic fandom grew in the late 1960s and through the 1970s. In 1981, he created a new painting that was featured on the cover of the 11th edition of the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide. During this same time, he began selling re-creations of his classic covers. In the early 1990s, Ernie Gerber published his two- volume Photo Journal Guide To Comic Books which featured on its covers a number of Cole's covers. As a result, the demand for Cole's work increased dramatically. Cole married Ellen Kovack in 1942; she later became a proficient letterer in her own right.Cole bio, Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928‚Äì1999.

Its exact borders depend on context, but it is often defined as being a region within the federal states of Saxony, Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt, or a smaller part of this region, such as the metropolitan area of Leipzig and Halle plus the surrounding counties. The name dates from the German Empire, when the region was approximately in the centre of the country. Since the German Empire's eastern territories became part of Poland (and Russia in the aftermath of World War II), \\"Central Germany\\" has been located east of the centre of the country, but the name is still often used in business, media and by the Central German Metropolitan Region. Against this background, the term is not or no longer to be understood as a geographic term.  History  In the German Empire, 1871‚Äì1918, Saxony occupied a central position geographically Historically also including most of Hesse, parts of Franconia and the south of Lower Saxony,Werner K√∂nig, \\"Mitteldeutschland als geografischer Begriff\\", in: dtv-Atlas Deutsche Sprache, December 2007, p. 120 the region is described as an area south of the linguistic Benrath line where Central German dialects were spoken. It ranked for centuries as one of the most advanced areas in Germany, a centre of both the Protestant Reformation and the 19th-century Industrial Revolution. Large parts of the area were once governed by one of the branches of the House of Wettin, with the exception of Anhalt and Reuss and, depending on the geographical definition, the Electorate of Hesse. They, thus, were dynastically in one or the other way linked to the Electorate of Saxony, at that time a major power in the German Empire. Starting from the 19th century, Prussia successively gained control over the northern parts of Central Germany. =19th century until World War II= Until World War II, this area was seen as the middle of Germany due to it lying approximately midway between Aachen and K√∂nigsberg. The Middle German Chemical Triangle was the central region of the three main German industrial areas between the Ruhr and Upper Silesia. In 1929 the Free State of Prussia and the Holy See agreed in the Prussian Concordat to combine several Catholic dioceses to form the new Middle German Ecclesiastical Province, spreading over eastern Westphalia, northern Hesse, most of Thuringia, today's Saxony-Anhalt and small parts of Saxony. During the Yalta Conference it was suggested as part of the Roosevelt Plan to create a central German state which would have combined roughly the areas formerly covered by the Saxon states of central Germany. After 1945, when Germany lost its eastern territories, most of Middle Germany fell into the Soviet Zone of occupation, becoming Germany's new East, which is why the 1949-founded German Democratic Republic (GDR) is often referred to as East Germany. For decades until Chancellor Willy Brandt started his Ostpolitik in 1969, official West German usage spoke of \\"Central Germany\\" to denote the German Democratic Republic. The term was used by both the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and by a large number of West German residents who had been expelled from the eastern provinces, who held a wide range of political views. However, after the West German Federal government accepted the fixed eastern border with Poland in 1970, implying that parts of Poland were still \\"eastern Germany\\" was associated only with far-right and revanchist viewpoints. = Post-reunification = German states of Saxony, Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt After the 1990 German reunification, activists (e.g. Aktion Mitteldeutschland e.V.) claimed that the larger Leipzig‚ÄìHalle area would benefit from asserting an economic identity, separate from the other more rural new states of former East Germany. The use of the term \\"Central Germany\\" was meant to underline its location in Central Europe and to recall the industrial glory of the area in former times. Mainly it is used in business and the media. In 1991, the states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia founded the public regional broadcaster Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (Middle German Broadcasting), a member of the ARD network. Private companies located in the area of Leipzig, Halle and Dessau often use the term \\"Central Germany\\", as do the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and some sports competitions, such as the Mitteldeutsche Meisterschaften (Central German Championships). The Central German Metropolitan Region comprises a regional development zone in the European METREX network (see below). Although most methods for determining the geographical center of Germany result in a point in \\"Central Germany\\" (for example Niederdorla in western Thuringia), the three-state area also comprises G√∂rlitz, the easternmost town in Germany, which lies on the border with Poland. Arguably, this eastern part, although part of the state of Saxony, is not part of the central German cultural region, as historically, the Lusatia region has its own history and traditions (see i.a. the Lusatian League), being closely linked to Bohemia. The same is true for Magdeburg and the areas surrounding it (i.e. the areas north of Anhalt) as they neither belong to the central German dialect group nor do they have a close cultural connection with the more southern parts, they were traditionally connected to Brandenburg and Prussia.  Cultural significance  Central Germany has played a crucial role in the development of German culture and identity. Already in medieval times, the region laid at the crossroads of two major trade routes in central Europe, the Via Regia and the Via Imperii which intersected at Leipzig, which made the region economically important. The region was the starting point of reformation in Germany and the bible translation by Luther was created here. The language used by Luther in his translation serves as a major source for the written modern standard German.Schreiber, Mathias (2006). Deutsch for sale, Der Spiegel, no. 40, October 2, 2006 (\\"So schuf er eine Hochsprache aus Volkssprache, s√§chsischem Kanzleideutsch (aus der Gegend von Mei√üen), Predigt und Alltagsrede, eine in sich widerspr√ºchliche, aber bildhafte und kraftvolle Mischung, an der die deutschsprachige Literatur im Grunde bis heute Ma√ü nimmt.\\") Johann Sebastian Bach was born and worked in the region. Furthermore, the region played an important role during the period of enlightenment. It is the place where Goethe and Schiller spent their most productive years (see: Weimar Classicism). The first European porcelain was invented at Meissen by Johann Friedrich B√∂ttger. The area has also been one of the regions with the earliest development of industrialisation in Germany and looks back to a long tradition of industry culture. Already in 1839, the Leipzig-Dresden railway was opened, the first long-distance railway in Germany. Saxony became an early home of the German labour movement and social democracy (General German Workers' Association). Karl Marx received his PhD degree from Jena University as the intellectual environment here was more liberal and open than in the Prussia- controlled Rhineland or even Berlin where his ideas had been refused. Germany's first democratic constitution, the Weimar Constitution of 1919, was deliberated and enacted in the city of Weimar. The city had intentionally been chosen as a meeting place at the center (\\"the heart\\") of Germany and as a symbol of German culture.

Other suffixed Interstates include I-69C, I-69E and I-69W in South Texas, and I-480N in Ohio, which is designated as such on mile markers but is otherwise unsigned. The state of Maryland has several unsigned suffixed Interstate designations that are designated by the Maryland State Highway Administration, rather than by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). There were once many more suffixed Interstates, as the three-digit Interstates were not designated until after all major routes were assigned numbers, including some short connections and spurs. (A few of the shortest, including I-190 and I-195, were assigned three-digit numbers almost immediately.) Most were not equal splits like on I-35, but had the main route continue through, and often the suffixed route never returned to its parent. In 1980, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) abolished the majority of suffixes due to confusion, renumbering them as three-digit Interstates.

He studied at the Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ in Ia»ôi, after which he went to Bucharest to study at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy, graduating in 1869, and obtaining his M.D. in 1877. After collaborating with Carol Davila, Istrati pursued his studies for three years at the University of Paris, where he obtained in 1885 a Ph.D. in Chemistry under the direction of Charles Adolphe Wurtz and Charles Friedel, with thesis On colored ethylbenzene and some observations about boiling points in the aromatic series.

Each volume in the series chronicled a specific time period ‚Äì the early-1970s, the mid-1970s, the late-1970s, the early-1980s, the mid-1980s, the late-1980s, the early-1990s and the mid-1990s. Each volume was issued on a compact disc or cassette. Individual volumes contained 22 tracks, and represented the highlighted time period's most popular and noteworthy tracks. Also included was a booklet, containing liner notes written by some of the most respected historians of the genre, photographs of the artists, and information on the songs (writers, performers and peak position on Billboard magazine's country charts). All told, the entire series contains 484 tracks. History \\"Contemporary Country\\" was first issued during the summer of 1991, and essentially picked up where Time-Life Music left off with its Country USA series; the earlier series covered country music from the 1950s through early 1970s. This series continued Time-Life's attempt at chronicling country music's post-1950 history. During its peak, the \\"Contemporary Country\\" series was advertised in television and magazine advertisements. The series was available by subscription (by calling a 1-800 number); those who purchased the series in that fashion received a new volume roughly every other month (on the format of their choice), and had the option of keeping the volumes they wanted. Each volume was also offered for individual sale. New volumes continued to be issued through 1993, the final one being a volume covering country music from the early 1990s. Another volume ‚Äì \\"The Mid-1990s,\\" with 20 tracks from 1991-1998 ‚Äì was released as part of the series in 2000, seven years after the last disc was issued. Time-Life continued to offer \\"Contemporary Country\\" through the early 2000s (decade). The series has essentially been replaced four series: * \\"Classic Country,\\" a series cataloging the music from the 1940s through mid-1980s (with some additional volumes containing post-1984 music). * \\"Country Gold,\\" covering the 1980s through mid-1990s. Three volumes of \\"Contemporary Country\\" have been repackaged as part of this series. Also part of this series is \\"Country's Got Heart,\\" providing post-1990 country music highlights. * \\"Superstars of Country,\\" containing highlights from the mid-1960s through mid-1980s. * \\"Lifetime of Country Romance,\\" similar to \\"Superstars of Country\\" but focusing more on ballads and love-themed songs. The series As with many of Time- Life Records' multi-volume releases, the volumes were not issued in a logical, sequential order by date or era of the subject; that is, issuing volumes covering the early 1970s before progressing to the mid-1970s. In the track information section, the volumes will be listed sequentially by era; the following list is the order in which the volumes were released. =1991= * Contemporary Country: The Mid ‚Äò80s * Contemporary Country: The Late ‚Äò70s * Contemporary Country: The Early ‚Äò80s * Contemporary Country: The Mid ‚Äò70s * Contemporary Country: The Late ‚Äò80s =1992= * Contemporary Country: The Early ‚Äò70s * Contemporary Country: The Mid '80s Pure Gold * Contemporary Country: The Mid '70s Pure Gold * Contemporary Country: The Early '80s Pure Gold * Contemporary Country: The Late '70s Pure Gold * Contemporary Country: The Late '80s Pure Gold * Contemporary Country: The Early '70s Pure Gold * Contemporary Country: The Mid '80s Hot Hits =1993= * Contemporary Country: The Late '70s Hot Hits * Contemporary Country: The Early '80s Hot Hits * Contemporary Country: The Mid '70s Hot Hits * Contemporary Country: The Late '80s Hot Hits * Contemporary Country: The Early '70s Hot Hits * Contemporary Country: The '70s Pure Gold * Contemporary Country: The '80s Pure Gold * Contemporary Country: The Early '90s =2000= * Contemporary Country: The Mid '90s Track listing =Contemporary Country: The '70s Pure Gold= * \\"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky\\" ‚Äì Johnny Cash * \\"It's Been a Great Afternoon\\" ‚Äì Merle Haggard * \\"If I Could Only Win Your Love\\" ‚Äì Emmylou Harris * \\"All Of Me\\" ‚Äì Willie Nelson * \\"Room Full of Roses\\" ‚Äì Mickey Gilley * \\"Among My Souvenirs\\" ‚Äì Marty Robbins * \\"You're the One\\" ‚Äì Oak Ridge Boys * \\"Rated 'X'\\" ‚Äì Loretta Lynn * \\"Don't Be Angry\\" ‚Äì Donna Fargo * \\"I May Never Get To Heaven\\" ‚Äì Conway Twitty * \\"A Picture Of Me (Without You)\\" ‚Äì George Jones * \\"Ruby (Are You Mad)\\" ‚Äì Buck Owens * \\"Baby Boy\\" ‚Äì Mary Kay Place (as Loretta Haggers) * \\"Rednecks, White Socks And Blue Ribbon Beer\\" - Johnny Russell * \\"Sometimes\\" ‚Äì Bill Anderson and Mary Lou Turner * \\"Feelin's\\" ‚Äì Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn * \\"Before My Time\\" ‚Äì John Conlee * \\"I'll Go To My Grave Loving You\\" ‚Äì Statler Brothers * \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" ‚Äì Jerry Lee Lewis * \\"Say It Again\\" ‚Äì Don Williams * \\"Broken Down in Tiny Pieces\\" ‚Äì Billy \\"Crash\\" Craddock * \\"Secret Love\\" ‚Äì Freddy Fender =Contemporary Country: The Early '70s= * \\"The Fightin' Side of Me\\" ‚Äì Merle Haggard * \\"Coal Miner's Daughter\\" ‚Äì Loretta Lynn * \\"Easy Loving\\" ‚Äì Freddie Hart * \\"Woman (Sensuous Woman)\\" ‚Äì Don Gibson * \\"Hello Darlin'\\" ‚Äì Conway Twitty * \\"Would You Take Another Chance On Me\\" ‚Äì Jerry Lee Lewis * \\"He Loves Me All The Way\\" ‚Äì Tammy Wynette * \\"Loving You Could Never Be Better\\" ‚Äì George Jones * \\"Empty Arms\\" ‚Äì Sonny James * \\"Help Me Make It Through The Night\\" ‚Äì Sammi Smith * \\"For The Good Times\\" ‚Äì Ray Price * \\"Joshua\\" ‚Äì Dolly Parton * \\"Kiss an Angel Good Morning\\" ‚Äì Charley Pride * \\"The Happiest Girl In The Whole USA\\" ‚Äì Donna Fargo * \\"Made In Japan\\" ‚Äì Buck Owens * \\"Behind Closed Doors\\" ‚Äì Charlie Rich * \\"When You're Hot You're Hot\\" ‚Äì Jerry Reed * \\"Rose Garden\\" ‚Äì Lynn Anderson * \\"Lead Me On\\" ‚Äì Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn * \\"The Year That Clayton Delaney Died\\" ‚Äì Tom T.

It is the only arboretum in Union County. A popular wedding spot, the arboretum grounds are open daily from dawn till dusk, free of charge.  History & landscape architecture  The property was originally traversed by Lenni Lenape Native Americans on their route from the coast near Elizabeth to the highlands near Schooley's Mountain. During the American Revolutionary War, it was farmed, and was adjacent to the site of the Old Sow cannon and the signal beacon atop Beacon Hill on the Second Watchung Mountain. In 1889, John Hornor Wisner, a merchant in the China trade, purchased the property for a country estate -- some 12 acres from the Swain farm. John and Isabelle Wisner, whose three children had been born in China,Martin, Cynthia B., Summit Historic Homes (p. 44) (Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing, 2013 - Images of America, series); accessed via Google Books search for John Hornor Wisner, with publisher detail via link there. Retrieved 2019-04-17. hired New York architects Babb, Cook and Willard to build a Colonial Revival house, sited facing south with extensive views over the rolling hills. The Wisners moved to their stylish new home and called it \\"The Clearing.\\" Working with noted landscape architect Calvert Vaux, they planted specimen trees and created flower beds and a meandering path around the property. In 1916, new owners, Richard and Susie Reeves, purchased the estate. Susie Reeves expanded the gardens, guided by prominent landscape architects Ellen Biddle Shipman (1924) and Carl F. Pilat (1924-1925), adding a rose garden in 1925. The Charles L. Reed family became the last private owners in 1968, adding an herb garden. In 1974, the estate was preserved as a public arboretum by the City of Summit.  Specialty gardens  The gardens are a beautifully maintained example of early 20th century landscape architecture, also known as the Country Place Era. Italianate in character, the garden layout is symmetrical and axial, creating formal garden rooms off a main axis from the house. The Gretchen Keller Azalea Garden (designed by Shipman and Pilat) and Rock Garden contain about 850 shrubs and 25 trees. Its peak bloom is in May, with the dogwoods, azaleas, lilacs, deutzia and crabapples. The Susie Graham Reeves Rose Garden contains 286 rose bushes, representing over 150 varieties of roses, including floribundas and hybrid teas laid out in a traditional circle-in-a-square design. The central feature of the rose garden is a cherub fountain from the Reeves period. Old fashioned roses flank the formal garden, and climbing roses are trained on posts and chains. Features: Wesson Nature Grove, Lilac Garden, Herb Garden, Vernal Pool, Woodland Trails (hiking paths), and tours.  Programs & events  Daffodil Day Over 30,000 daffodils bloom in a glacial bowl in front of Wisner House each April. The Arboretum hosts its annual Daffodil Day event to celebrate. The original flowers were planted by Susie Graham Reeves in the 1920s. Since 2014, the Arboretum has used a small herd of Nubian goats to remove excess vegetation and weeds. Celebrate Fall Annually, the Arboretum hosts a celebration of autumn with events such as cidering, seasonal cooking demonstrations and pumpkin carving. Other events at the garden have included a Maple Sugar Fest, Great American Backyard Campout, Holiday House Tour, and Sounds of a Summer Night. Features: Wesson Nature Grove, Lilac Garden, Herb Garden, Vernal Pool, Woodland Trails (hiking paths), and tours. Square Foot Gardening A pilot program started in 2018 is designed to provide children with a connection to nature through organic vegetable gardening. Educational Programs Children in school groups visit the Arboretum for field trips on science topics, and scout groups earn badges from special programs. In summer, kids attend a wide variety of weekly nature-themed camps, organized by age. Adults visit for sessions such as Gardening 101 and Backyard Bird Feeding tips, as well as related special collaborations with arts organizations.

Caitlin is a main character on both Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High, which chronicle her maturation from a seventh grader to a high school graduate. Mistysyn returned to play an adult Caitlin on Degrassi: The Next Generation, in which Caitlin was a recurring character. Development Mistysyn was taking dance lessons when she received a flyer advertising auditions for the series. Unaware of what to wear to the audition, Mistysyn auditioned in shorts and a tank top; she believed that this helped her in the process because the producers \\"were looking for kids just being kids\\". When Mistysyn failed to land the role she was auditioning for, writer Yan Moore created Caitlin specifically for the actress. The character was initially named Amanda, but was renamed \\"Caitlin\\" after someone in show publicist Kathryn Ellis's family. Caitlin became the favorite Degrassi character of American screenwriter and film director Kevin Smith, who named the character \\"Caitlin Bree\\" from his 1994 movie Clerks after her. Smith's enthusiasm led the series's producers to create a three-episode story arc for him on Degrassi: The Next Generation, in which Smith develops a relationship with Caitlin. Mistysyn has earned three Gemini nominations for her portrayal of Caitlin, \\"including a win for best performance by a lead actress in a continuing dramatic role.\\" Storylines =Youth= Caitlin was born to a teacher father and a vice principal mother on March 2, 1972. It is mentioned in the series that she has a brother named Patrick, but he is never seen on the show. Caitlin is an epileptic and suffers seizures when she does not take her medication. Caitlin is a strong student and an opinionated, passionate, and outspoken social activist on issues such as the environment, animal rights, and feminism in addition to local issues, such as teacher firings. She often expresses her views through Degrassi Junior High's newspaper, which she joins in grade seven and is appointed editor of in grade eight. Her best friend throughout junior high is Susie Rivera, and her best friend in high school is paraplegic Maya Goldberg. Caitlin once struggled with her sexual identity, unsure about whether or not she was a lesbian because of her feelings toward and dreams of Ms. Avery, one of her teachers. Ms. Avery helps Caitlin sort through her feelings and realize that just because she had feelings towards Ms. Avery did not necessarily mean she was gay. In grade seven, Caitlin develops an infatuation with Rick Munro. The following season, she gradually begins a relationship with Joey Jeremiah. Caitlin breaks up with Joey after entering high school and meeting Claude Tanner; Claude's intellect and interest in social activism is in stark contrast to Joey's immature attitude and apathy for social issues. Her relationship with Claude ends when a security guard spots them spray painting a nuclear plant; Caitlin's jacket catches on the barbed wire atop the chain link fence, and Claude flees instead of helping her. Caitlin is sentenced to several hours of community service for her crime. At home, Caitlin's family is emotionally crippled when her father's infidelity is exposed. After Claude commits suicide the following year, Caitlin and Joey eventually reconcile and resume dating. Joey proposes to Caitlin the next year, but Caitlin declines, citing the uncertainty of her future. That summer, Caitlin loses her virginity to Joey and eventually accepts his engagement proposal. Their engagement, however, only lasts about ten minutes due to her discovery of his infidelity. Caitlin continues her life after high school without Joey by enrolling into Carleton University to study journalism. =Adulthood= As an adult, Caitlin was a recurring character on Degrassi: The Next Generation. She hosts an environmental television program called Ryan's Planet. As a grown-up, she has also developed a propensity to be klutzy at times; however, she has been seizure-free long enough to have a driver's license and her having had epilepsy is not mentioned. In the series premiere of Degrassi: The Next Generation, Caitlin lives in the Los Angeles area and is engaged to a Hollywood producer named Keith. However, Caitlin ends the relationship when she learns about Keith's doubts about going through with marriage. Caitlin later confides with Joey that her rushing into marriage was a product of her relationship insecurities. In Season 2, both Caitlin and Lucy make brief returns as members of Spike's bridal party, at which point, Caitlin comforts Spike about her unplanned pregnancy. Caitlin is shown to be close to Spike's daughter, Emma, and shares a friendly dance with Joey at the reception. She attends the funeral of Craig's father, Albert Manning. In Season 3, Caitlin moves back to Toronto after her U.S. television program ends. She gets a job working at a local television station CQJH on the show Local Heroes as a journalist. She finds Joey in a relationship with a woman named Sidney and soon becomes jealous. Sidney, meanwhile, grows distrustful of Joey's friendship with Caitlin and later asks him whom he loved. Joey and Sidney break up and Caitlin and Joey end up kissing that same night. Later that year Caitlin is informed that there is interest in a piece she had done on HIV/AIDS a year previously. After some emotional talks with Joey, she decides to leave for a trip around the world for nine months to do her piece. Caitlin returns in Season 4 to learn that Joey's car dealership has been doing poorly and his house has been put up for sale by Sidney. Caitlin makes a deal with Sidney, giving closure to their hostility, and buys the house for Joey. This causes a feud between Joey and Caitlin, but the matter is set aside when they learn that there has been a school shooting at Degrassi. Later that year, Caitlin meets with Kevin Smith to interview him about his new movie Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh? Kevin chooses Degrassi as the set for the movie and things heat up between him and Caitlin on set. Later, Caitlin's boss argues with Caitlin over her skills as a journalist and takes her off the Kevin Smith story. Caitlin, feeling a lack of freedom, quits her job on Local Heroes and ends up at a bar with Kevin Smith where she, while drunk, makes out with him. She heads back to Joey's house, still drunk, and proposes to Joey. Joey accepts, and the wedding plans are on. Caitlin then, surprisingly, gets an offer to revive her show Ryan's Planet, courtesy of Kevin Smith. Caitlin reveals to Kevin she is engaged to Joey, and an argument emerges. Facing a tough decision, she takes it out on Joey and they decide not to get married after agreeing that all they do is fight. Caitlin takes Kevin up on his offer and leaves with him to Los Angeles after a tearful goodbye. Caitlin appears in only one episode in season five despite being credited as a season regular. In the episode, Emma arranges for Caitlin to visit her mother, Spike, and console her after Spike's husband kisses the school principal. She again returns to Toronto during the seventh season episode \\"Jesse's Girl\\", where she inadvertently hooks up with Ellie's boyfriend Jesse, leading Ellie to realize that Jesse is not the man that she is meant to be with and Caitlin once again helps Ellie through this.

Jolliffe was born in Bloomsbury, Middlesex, England, in 1851, the son of William Peter Jolliffe and Harriett Penny. He qualified as a barrister and practised in London, Newcastle upon Tyne and North Shields. On his father's death in 1887, he moved to Australia, and then to New Zealand in 1896. He married 20-year-old Nellie Young in Lower Hutt on 6 November 1902. They had two daughters and a son. After drafting the Cinematograph-film Censorship Act 1916, Jolliffe was appointed Censor of Cinematograph Films on 16 September 1916, at the age of 65. The Act provided that no film could by exhibited to the public until it had been passed by the censor. The Act also provided that no film could be approved which \\"in the opinion of the censor, depicts any matter that is against public order and decency, or the exhibition of which for any other reason is, in the opinion of the censor, undesirable in the public interest\\". Distributors were given the right to appeal the censor's rejection of a film, but no one could appeal the approval of a film until 1934. In Jolliffe's first full year (1917 to 1918) he reviewed 2,825 films totalling over 1,400 hours, and refused to approve 43, he also required cuts to 279. There was only one appeal against his decision, and it was dismissed. The revenue generated by the examination fees for this number of films meant that Jolliffe could afford to hire an assistant, James McDonald, in August 1918. In 1917, after church groups objected to D. W. Griffith's film Intolerance being passed without cuts, the Minister of Internal Affairs suggested that Jolliffe adopt and publish a list of prohibited topics. Jolliffe resisted this suggestion because he believed that it was impossible to formulate guidelines applicable to all films, a view that has become a tradition among New Zealand censors to this day. Nevertheless, he generally required cuts from films that depicted \\"the commission of crime in a manner likely to be imitated, especially by the young, or to give information as to methods to persons of a criminal tendency\\", indecency in dress, irreverent treatment of religious subjects, disloyalty to King and country, and \\"any matter likely to effect class hatred\\". In 1920, Jolliffe introduced two ratings: a \\"U\\" (for \\"universal\\") certificate denoted that a film was suitable for everyone; and an \\"A\\" rating indicated that a film was more suitable for adult viewing. Both certificates were recommendations intended to help parents decide what their children could view. In May 1921 the Minister (probably illegally) directed Jolliffe to ensure that any film in which \\"thieving, robbery, murder, or suicide is made the feature\\" was not approved for exhibition. No discernible increase in banned films resulted, and the requirement was quietly dropped by 1925. William Jolliffe died in office and was succeeded by his assistant, W. A. Tanner.

This element specifies the communication endpoint the data entered into the form should be submitted to, and the method of submitting the data, \`GET\` or \`POST\`. = Elements = Forms can be made up of standard graphical user interface elements: * \`<text>\` ‚Äî a simple text box that allows input of a single line of text. * \`<email>\` \\\\- a type of \`<text>\` that requires a partially validated email address * \`<number>\` \\\\- a type of \`<text>\` that requires a number * \`<password>\` ‚Äî similar to \`<text>\`, it is used for security purposes, in which the characters typed in are invisible or replaced by symbols such as *) * \`<radio>\` ‚Äî a radio button * \`<file>\` ‚Äî a file select control for uploading a file * \`<reset>\` ‚Äî a reset button that, when activated, tells the browser to restore the values to their initial values. * \`<submit>\` ‚Äî a button that tells the browser to take action on the form (typically to send it to a server) * \`<textarea>\` ‚Äî much like the \`<text>\` input field except a \`<textarea>\` allows for multiple rows of data to be shown and entered * \`<select>\` ‚Äî a drop-down list that displays a list of items a user can select from The sample image on the right shows most of these elements: * a text box asking for your name * a pair of radio buttons asking you to pick your sex * a select box giving you a list of eye colors to choose from * a pair of check boxes to click on if they apply to you * a text area to describe your athletic ability * a submit button to send it to the server These basic elements provide most common graphical user interface (GUI) elements, but not all. For example, there are no equivalents to a tree view or grid view. A grid view, however, can be mimicked by using a standard HTML table with each cell containing a text input element. A tree view could also be mimicked through nested tables or, more semantically appropriately, nested lists. In both cases, a server-side process is responsible for processing the information, while JavaScript handles the user- interaction. Implementations of these interface elements are available through JavaScript libraries such as jQuery. HTML 4 introduced the \`<label>\` tag, which is intended to represent a caption in a user interface, and can be associated with a specific form control by specifying the \`id\` attribute of the control in the label tag's \`for\` attribute. This allows labels to stay with their elements when a window is resized and to allow more desktop-like functionality (e.g. clicking a radio button or checkbox's label will activate the associated input element). HTML 5 introduces a number of input tags that can be represented by other interface elements. Some are based upon text input fields and are intended to input and validate specific common data. These include \`<email>\` to enter email addresses, \`<tel>\` for telephone numbers, \`<number>\` for numeric values. There are additional attributes to specify required fields, fields that should have keyboard focus when the web page containing the form is loaded, and placeholder text that is displayed within the field but is not user input (such as the 'Search' text displayed in many search input fields before a search term is entered). These tasks used to be handled with JavaScript, but had become so common that support for them was added to the standard. The \`<date>\` input type displays a calendar from which the user can select a date or date range. And the \`color\` input type can be represented as an input text simply checking the value entered is a correct hexadecimal representation of a color, according to the specification, or a color picker widget (the latter being the solution used in most browsers which support this attribute).  Submission  When data that has been entered into HTML forms is submitted, the names and values in the form elements are encoded and sent to the server in an HTTP request message using GET or POST. Historically, an email transport was also used.User-agent support for email based HTML form submission, using a 'mailto' URL as the form action, was proposed in RFC 1867 section 5.6, during the HTML 3.2 era. Various web browsers implemented it by invoking a separate email program, using their own rudimentary SMTP capabilities, or by becoming Internet suites by implementing entire Email clients. Although sometimes unreliable, it was briefly popular as a simple way to transmit form data without involving a web server or CGI scripts. The default mime type, Internet media type application/x-www-form- urlencoded, is based on a very early version of the general URI percent- encoding rules, with a number of modifications such as newline normalization and replacing spaces with \\"\`+\`\\" instead of \\"\`%20\`\\". Another possible encoding, Internet media type multipart/form-data, is also available and is common for POST-based file submissions. Use with programming languages Forms are usually combined with programs written in various programming language to allow developers to create dynamic web sites. The most popular languages include both client-side and/or server-side languages. Although any programming language can be used on the server to process a form's data, the most commonly used languages are scripting languages, which tend to have stronger string handling functionality than programming languages such as C, and also have automatic memory management which helps to prevent buffer overrun attacks. =Client-side= The de facto client-side scripting language for web sites is JavaScript. Using JavaScript on the Document Object Model (DOM) leads to the method of Dynamic HTML that allows dynamic creation and modification of a web page within the browser. While client-side languages used in conjunction with forms are limited, they often can serve to do pre- validation of the form data and/or to prepare the form data to send to a server-side program. This usage is being replaced, however, by HTML5's new \`input\` field types and \`required\` attribute. =Server-side execution= Server-side code can do a vast assortment of tasks to create dynamic web sites that, for technical or security reasons, client-side code cannot -- from authenticating a login, to retrieving and storing data in a database, to spell checking, to sending e-mail. A significant advantage to server-side over client-side execution is the concentration of functionality onto the server rather than relying on different web browsers to implement various functions in consistent, standardized ways. In addition, processing forms on a server often results in increased security if server-side execution is designed not to trust the data supplied by the client and includes such techniques as HTML sanitization. One disadvantage to server side code is scalability--server side processing for all users occurs on the server, while client side processing occurs on individual client computers. Registration form of PHP-based e-commerce web-shop software ZenCart =Interpreted languages= Some of the interpreted languages commonly used to design interactive forms in web development are PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, JSP, Adobe ColdFusion and some of the compiled languages commonly used are Java and C# with ASP.NET. PHP PHP is one very common language used for server-side \\"programming\\" and is one of the few languages created specifically for web programming. To use PHP with an HTML form, the URL of the PHP script is specified in the \`action\` attribute of the form tag. The target PHP file then accesses the data passed by the form through PHP's $_POST or $_GET variables, depending on the value of the \`method\` attribute used in the form. Here is a basic form handler PHP script that will display the contents of the input field on the page: '''''' Name: '''''' The sample code above uses PHP's filter_input() function to sanitize the user's input before inserting it onto the page. Simply printing (echoing) user input to the browser without checking it first is something that should be avoided in secure forms processors: if a user entered the JavaScript code into the field, the browser would execute the script on the page, just as if it had been coded by the developer; malicious code could be executed this way. filter_input() was introduced in PHP 5.2. Users of earlier PHP versions could use the htmlspecialchars() function, or regular expressions to sanitize the user input before doing anything with it. Perl programming language Perl is another language often used for web development. Perl scripts are traditionally used as Common Gateway Interface applications (CGIs). In fact, Perl is such a common way to write CGIs that the two are often confused. CGIs may be written in other languages than Perl (compatibility with multiple languages is a design goal of the CGI protocol) and there are other ways to make Perl scripts interoperate with a web server than using CGI (such as FastCGI, Plack or Apache's mod_perl). Perl CGIs were once a very common way to write web applications. However, many web hosts today effectively only support PHP, and developers of web applications often seek compatibility with them. A modern Perl 5 CGI using the CGI module with a form similar to the one above might look like: '''''' #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use CGI qw(:standard); my $name= param('firstname'); print header; print html( body( p(\\"Hello, $name!\\"), ), ); Form-to-email scripts Among the simplest and most commonly needed types of server-side script is that which simply emails the contents of a submitted form. This kind of script is frequently exploited by spammers, however, and many of the most popular form-to-email scripts in use are vulnerable to hijacking for the purpose of sending spam emails. One of the most popular scripts of this type was \\"FormMail.pl\\" made by Matt's Script Archive. Today, this script is no longer widely used in new development due to lack of updates, security concerns, and difficulty of configuration. =Form builders= Some companies offer forms as a hosted service. Usually, these companies give some kind of visual editor, reporting tools and infrastructure to create and host the forms, that can be embedded into webpages. Web hosting companies provide templates to their clients as an add-on service. Other form hosting services offer free contact forms that a user can install on their own website by pasting the service's code into the site's HTML.

Their union was in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 because the Prince had not asked his father's permission, and so she was not recognised as his wife. Early life Lady Augusta was born in Scotland. Her father was John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore and her mother was Lady Charlotte Stewart, a younger daughter of Alexander Stewart, 6th Earl of Galloway. Marriage Lady Augusta secretly married Prince Augustus Frederick, sixth son of King George III, on 4 April 1793, in a Church of England ceremony in her lodgings at Hotel Sarmiento, Rome. They were married again on 5 December 1793 in St George's, Hanover Square, London, using their correct names but without revealing their full identities. Both marriage ceremonies were outside the terms of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and were annulled in July 1794.

Adams, Dick Clement, and Ian La Frenais, and directed by Marco Brambilla about a neglected young woman who stages her own kidnapping to get her father's attention, only to be actually kidnapped by a car thief. The film stars Alicia Silverstone (who was also an uncredited producer), Benicio del Toro, and Christopher Walken. Plot Emily Hope (Alicia Silverstone) stages her own kidnapping to get the attention of her father. She puts herself into the trunk of her own car (a BMW 850i), tapes her legs and mouth, handcuffs her hands and calls the police so they can come \\"rescue\\" her. But then, unexpectedly, a car thief named Vincent Roche (Benicio del Toro) steals the car with her in it. Suddenly, Emily finds herself actually kidnapped, only the kidnapper doesn‚Äôt know what to do with her. Christopher Walken shows up as Emily‚Äôs Uncle Ray, Jack Thompson as Emily‚Äôs father, and Harry Connick, Jr., as Greg, Vincent‚Äôs car-stealing partner. Background The script for Excess Baggage was the winner of the first annual Austin Film Festival Screenplay Competition where it was picked up by Barry Josephson when he was at Sony and made into the 1997 comedy starring Alicia Silverstone. Cast * Alicia Silverstone as Emily Hope, a rich girl with a black belt in karate and a tendency for trouble. She had burned down her school library, perhaps to get the attention of her father when she was younger. Her relationship with her father is quite cold, but she has a solid friendship with her Uncle Ray and builds one with Vincent after he accidentally abducts her. * Benicio del Toro as Vincent Roche, a successful and experienced car thief who supports himself with his work. He is referred to as \\"an innocent thief\\" who happens to steal the car with Emily in the trunk. After this his entire life is turned upside down as he gets implicated in several schemes and becomes dependent on his \\"hostage\\" to survive. * Christopher Walken as Raymond \\"Uncle Ray\\" Perkins, Emily's uncle and cares for her well-being much more than her own father. He also suspects that this kidnapping situation is not a real kidnapping and might be one of Emily's \\"games\\" to get some much craved attention from her dad. His first encounters with Vincent are rather hostile, but the two eventually form a camaraderie. * Jack Thompson as Alexander T. Hope, Emily's father and a very rich and successful businessman. He also pays little to no attention to his daughter, which often leads to her performing such outrageous stunts to get it as burning down her school library or staging her own kidnapping; these tend to backfire as the more effort she invests in trying to get him to pay attention to her, the less he sees fit to pay to her. It is hinted that his business deals may be corrupt. * Harry Connick Jr. as Greg Kistler, Vincent's partner- in-crime, but it appears that Vincent does most of the work. They steal cars and sell them to people like Gus and Stick, which eventually lands them into trouble when their operation is burned down and Vincent is on the lam. * Nicholas Turturro and Michael Bowen as Stick and Gus, two hoodlums who have had business transactions which Vincent and Greg but eventually turn on them. * Leland Orser and Robert Wisden as Detectives Bernaby and Sims, two detectives who are investigating Emily's \\"kidnapping\\". * Sally Kirkland as Louise Doucette, a bartender/waitress at a cafe near Vincent's home. Ray gets information about Vincent from her during his investigation of the kidnapping. She only appears in two scenes. The film features cameo appearances by voice- actor David Kaye, April Telek and Matthew Robert Kelly, all of them uncredited. Production This was the first film produced by Alicia Silverstone under her production company First Kiss and was filmed in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The yellow leather jacket worn by Silverstone's character was sold to actor/stand-up comic Paul Rawson for $890.

In 1282 Eudokia married in Constantinople John II Megaskomnenos, Emperor of Trebizond with whom she had two sons, Alexios and Michael.William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 29 In 1298, after her husband's death and the ascension of her son Alexios II, she returned to her brother's court at Constantinople taking her younger son Michael with her.Miller, Trebizond, p. 32 Andronikos II Palaiologos received his sister, planning to use her to seal a diplomatic settlement with Stefan Uro≈° II Milutin, King of Serbia: the hand of Eudokia in return for a negotiated peace. King Stefan was agreeable to this proposal, for one of his three wives had recently died. \\"But nothing that Andronikos could do would influence his sister to entertain the prospect of life with a lecherous barbarian in the wilds of Serbia,\\" writes Donald M. Nicol.Nicol, The last centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453, second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 119 King Stefan was forced to settle for Andronikos' daughter Simonida by his second wife, Irene of Montferrat. Meanwhile, Alexios II decided for himself to marry Djiadjak Jaqeli, a Georgian princess. His uncle Andronikos II, who had been appointed his guardian by his father, wanted this marriage annulled; he had planned for Alexios to marry the daughter of the high court official Nikephoros Choumnos. Eudokia used the pretext of inducing her son to dissolve the marriage to obtain her brother's permission to return to Trebizond in 1301; upon arriving, she instead advised her son to keep his Georgian wife. Eudokia died in the following year, and William Miller speculates she was buried in the church of Saint Gregory of Nyssa.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 32f Anthony Bryer has proposed that a Eudokia, who became a nun by the monastic name Euphemia, mentioned in a painted inscription recorded by Fallmerayer from the Panagia Theoskepastos Monastery, may have been Eudokia Palaologina. This Eudokia has not been satisfactorily proven to be a member of the house of the Great Komnenoi, and Bryer offers a number of objections to any identification. He notes that there is \\"a strong independent local nineteenth-century tradition\\" that Eudokia founded the church of St. Gregory of Nyssa before her death. Lastly, Bryer notes that \\"it would not be surprising if she would have wished to put not only distance but a nun's veil between herself and her brother's ruthless and alarming marital plans (which included Mongol and Turkish alliances for other female members of his family) before she died in 1302.\\"Bryer, \\"Who was Eudokia-Euphemia?\\" Archeion Pontou, 33 (1976), pp. 17-24  References  External links *Her profile in \\"Medieval Lands\\" by Charles Cawley Category:1265 births Category:1302 deaths Category:Empresses consort of Trebizond Category:Greek women of the Byzantine Empire Eudokia Category:13th- century Byzantine women Category:14th-century Byzantine women Category:Daughters of Byzantine emperors Category:Michael VIII Palaiologos ","title":"Eudokia Palaiologina"},{"id":"3422785","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1959 in Australia.

Music Unlimited was an on-demand online music service launched on May 10, 2005 and provided by Yahoo! Music. The service was discontinued on September 30, 2008. Service Users paid a subscription fee to access a library of over two million songs which could be either streamed or downloaded as DRM'd WMA files and played from a computer in near CD quality sound. Subscribers could also download songs at a discounted rate of $0.79 per song for transfer to CD or supported portable devices. Yahoo! Music Engine was the original client for the service. Subsequently, the client changed to the Yahoo! Music Jukebox. The service required an active Internet connection to play Yahoo! Music Unlimited tracks added to Yahoo! Music Jukebox's My Music. Billing Yahoo! offered two billing options: $8.99 monthly, or $71.88 billed annually (calculated to $5.99 per month). To transfer downloaded music to a compatible portable music player, an additional $6 per month were added to both plans. The subscription services were only available for users living in the U.S. or Canada and required a credit card (no other billing method was accepted). Before November 1, 2005, the To Go feature was included at no extra charge. However, experts believe that this was done in order for Yahoo! to promote their service. Features Users who subscribed to Yahoo! Music Unlimited were able to stream and download an unlimited number of music tracks, but Janus DRM (digital rights management) technology prevents these tracks from being accessed once a user's subscription is discontinued or expires. Thus, if a user wishes to download and own a music track, they must pay an additional fee. The digital rights management employed by Yahoo prevents a user from freely distributing these tracks. Users living outside the US or Canada could still download the player and enjoy the features of the Yahoo! Music Engine, a software product that functioned as a music collection organizer similar to iTunes. Yahoo! tech support reported that Windows Media Audio codec, similar to MP3, was used at 192 kbit/s for all songs. This is a high-quality encoding and without high-end playback equipment, nearly indistinguishable from CD. Similar services The former Napster To Go and Rhapsody Unlimited, provided by Napster and RealNetworks respectively, were both similar to Yahoo! Music Unlimited, although subscription fees were slightly higher. Yahoo also offered Musicmatch On Demand, a streaming music subscription service available through the Musicmatch Jukebox client. On August 31, 2007, Musicmatch Jukebox shut down. Musicmatch temporarily offered a free migration to Yahoo Music Unlimited. Discontinuation The Yahoo Music Unlimited service was discontinued on September 30, 2008. Yahoo's existing users were either transferred to Rhapsody (if they chose to transfer) or had their accounts deactivated. Yahoo-Rhapsody FAQ See also *LAUNCHcast *Yahoo!

He played college football at the University of Georgia. Early years Thornton attended LaGrange High School, where he was a three- year starter at running back. As a senior, he earned Super Prep All-America honors after finishing with 1,920 rushing yards, 28 touchdowns, 932 return yards and 12 blocked kicks. In his high school career he totalled 560 carries for 4,541 rushing yards. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Georgia. He redshirted his freshman year after breaking his thumb. The following season, he only started one game at tailback, registering 230 yards, 47 carries, 3 touchdowns (2 were against New Mexico State University), while averaging 18.4 yards per kickoff return. As a sophomore, he was converted into a cornerback by Willie Martinez, Georgia's secondary coach and defensive coordinator. He had 9 starts, while collecting 32 tackles, one tackle for loss and 7 passes defensed. As a junior, he collected 43 tackles, 4 tackles for loss, 2 interceptions, 6 passes defensed . He returned a blocked punt 12 yards for a touchdown against Northwestern Louisiana State University. He also returned an interception 71 yards (second longest in school history) for a touchdown in the Sugar Bowl against Florida State University. As a senior, he was named a team captain and was the Bulldogs' best cornerback, starting 13 games and often facing the opponents' best wide receiver. He posted 54 tackles (seventh on the team), 3 tackles for loss, 8 passes defensed and 2 interceptions. He finished his college career with 129 tackles (8 for loss), 4 interceptions, 21 passes defensed, 41 carries for 230 yards, 3 touchdowns and 22 kickoff returns for 404 yards (18.4-yard average). as a sophomore ‚Ä¶ Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Thornton was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (121st overall) of the 2004 NFL Draft. He only appeared in one game, in which he returned two kickoffs for 43 yards, before tearing his ACL. He was placed on the injured reserve list on October 12. He was waived on September 8, 2005. =San Francisco 49ers= On September 14, 2005, the San Francisco 49ers signed him to their practice squad. Injuries forced the 49ers to promote him to the active roster on October 2 and eventually named him the starter at left cornerback. In his first start he was matched against All-Pro Marvin Harrison, and was able to limit him to 2 receptions for 17 yards. He also intercepted quarterback Peyton Manning in the end zone, and received honorable-mention NFL defensive player of the week honors for his efforts. He appeared in 12 games with 11 starts, finishing with 32 tackles, 2 interceptions and 8 passes defensed. On August 1, 2006, he was released after struggles in his play caused him to drop on the depth chart. =New York Jets= On August 4, 2006, he signed as a free agent with the New York Jets and was waived 8 days later. =Jacksonville Jaguars= On May 9, 2007, he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars to replaced the recently waived Ahmad Carroll. He was released on September 1. =Montreal Alouettes (CFL)= On October 11, 2007, Thornton joined the Montreal Alouettes practice roster. In 2008, he did not make the team after being released on June 14.

It is a pressed, uncooked cheese made from Salers cow's milk between the fifteenth of April and the fifteenth of November. It is similar to Cantal cheese ‚Äì which is produced from the same cows' milk when they are fed on hay during the remaining months of the year ‚Äì and has been estimated to have been fabricated in this region for at least 2000 years. It came to prominence when Mar√©chal de Senneterre served it at the table of Louis XIV of France. Mar√©chal de Senneterre is also responsible for the introduction of Saint-Nectaire and Cantal. Salers has benefited from the Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) since 1961. It is best eaten between September and March, after an ageing time of nine months, but it is also excellent all year round. Salers de Buron Traditional is only made up in the chalet (called a buron in the Auvergne) in the summer months with milk exclusively from the Salers cow. It must also be made in the traditional wooden gerle. It is circular in shape, weighing around . 1,112 tonnes were produced in 1998 (+15.1% since 1996). All was made in local farms from unpasteurized milk by about one hundred producers. right  References  Category:French cheeses Category:Occitan cheeses Category:Cantal Category:Cow's-milk cheeses ","title":"Salers cheese"},{"id":"3422875","text":"Pomy may refer to several places: * Pomy VD, in Switzerland * Pomy, Aude, a commune of the Aude d√©partement, in France ","title":"Pomy"},{"id":"3422877","text":"Dan Neville (born 8 December 1946) is a former Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party from 2014 to 2016.

Definition The Thirring model is given by the Lagrangian density : \\\\mathcal{L}= \\\\overline{\\\\psi}(i\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/-m)\\\\psi -\\\\frac{g}{2}\\\\left(\\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\psi\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma_\\\\mu \\\\psi\\\\right)\\\\ where \\\\psi=(\\\\psi_+,\\\\psi_-) is the field, g is the coupling constant, m is the mass, and \\\\gamma^\\\\mu, for \\\\mu = 0,1, are the two-dimensional gamma matrices. This is the unique model of (1+1)-dimensional, Dirac fermions with a local (self-)interaction. Indeed, since there are only 4 independent fields, because of the Pauli principle, all the quartic, local interactions are equivalent; and all higher power, local interactions vanish. (Interactions containing derivatives, such as (\\\\bar \\\\psi\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/\\\\psi)^2, are not considered because they are non- renormalizable.) The correlation functions of the Thirring model (massive or massless) verify the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, and hence the theory makes sense as a quantum field theory. Massless case The massless Thirring model is exactly solvable in the sense that a formula for the n-points field correlation is known. =Exact solution= After it was introduced by Walter Thirring, many authors tried to solve the massless case, with confusing outcomes. The correct formula for the two and four point correlation was finally found by K. Johnson; then C. R. Hagen and B. Klaiber extended the explicit solution to any multipoint correlation function of the fields. Massive Thirring model, or MTM The mass spectrum of the model and the scattering matrix was explicitly evaluated by Bethe Ansatz. An explicit formula for the correlations is not known. J. I. Cirac, P. Maraner and J. K. Pachos applied the massive Thirring model to the description of optical lattices. =Exact solution= In one space dimension and one time dimension the model can be solved by the Bethe Ansatz. This helps one calculate exactly the mass spectrum and scattering matrix. Calculation of the scattering matrix reproduces the results published earlier by Alexander Zamolodchikov. The paper with the exact solution of Massive Thirring model by Bethe Ansatz was first published in Russian. Translated in Ultraviolet renormalization was done in the frame of the Bethe Ansatz. The fractional charge appears in the model during renormalization as a repulsion beyond the cutoff. Multi-particle production cancels on mass shell. The exact solution shows once again the equivalence of the Thirring model and the quantum sine-Gordon model. The Thirring model is S-dual to the sine-Gordon model. The fundamental fermions of the Thirring model correspond to the solitons of the sine-Gordon model. Bosonization S. Coleman discovered an equivalence between the Thirring and the sine-Gordon models. Despite the fact that the latter is a pure boson model, massless Thirring fermions are equivalent to free bosons; besides massive fermions are equivalent to the sine-Gordon bosons. This phenomenon is more general in two dimensions and is called bosonization.

Sligo, Ireland. She was a sister of Bishop Conal of Drumconnell. Her feast day is 11 August. Life A native of County Sligo, Athracht resolved to devote herself to God, but being opposed by her parents, fled to south Connacht and made her first foundation at Drum, County Roscommon, where her brother Conal had established a church. The place came to be called Drumconnell. From there she removed to Greagraighe or Coolavin, County Sligo. Her legend states that she took her vows as a nun under Saint Patrick at Coolavin. She then moved to Lough Gara, where she founded a hostel for travellers at a place now called Killaraght in her honour. The hostel survived until 1539.Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John.

They are known for their technical style, and soon switched to a more groove based style with the release of their 2007 album Minus the Herd.Ion Dissonance - Minus The Herd review Minus the Herd represents a new direction and sound for the band... ...the changes aren't just from a vocal perspective; as the chaotic elements of Ion Dissonance's metalcore/mathcore sound has been toned down to make way for a groovier and more accessible feel throughout. In total, the group have released five full-length albums and are well renown in the Montreal music scene. History Antoine Lussier and Sebastien Chaput formed Ion Dissonance during the late summer of 2001 with the intention of creating a fusion of hardcore and metal that was more complex and daring than what they have done before. Jean-Fran√ßois Richard would join shortly after on drums. With these members, their sound started to take shape, but they still required a few more individuals to fill some parts. To that end they recruited Gabriel McCaughry (vocals) and Sebastien Painchaud (bass guitar). Upon completing their first official line-up, the band released a demo CD named .357, which was quickly put together in 2002 for promotional purposes to various zines, labels and individuals around North America. This demo is now out of print but was released on mp3.com. Within no time, once obtaining The Gift, they received positive reviews and reactions. In this short time, they had to pick an appropriate label to support them and soon release their first LP. They decided to stay with Willowtip Records (Cacophonous Records in Europe). The line-up was changed when Sebastien Painchaud was replaced by their second bassist, Miguel Valade. With this change, they started playing their first major shows as the opening act for such bands as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die, Daughters, Misery Index, The End, and The Black Dahlia Murder. During April 2003 they started the recording process for their first LP, Breathing Is Irrelevant with producer Yannick St-Amand (Neuraxis, Martyr, Despised icon, In Dying Days), the album was completed in June 2003, and it came out in September 2003. It received many favourable reviews from a number of webzines and magazines including Metal Maniacs, Terrorizer and Unrestrained!. In 2004, they started their first big tour including shows along US East Coast with Forever Is Forgotten, which was successful due to the positive reaction from the crowds; shows from the East to West Coast of Canada with fellow Canadians The End; this was then followed by the Maryland Deathfest. Subsequently, bassist Miguel Valade was replaced by Xavier St- Laurent. After the release of their second album Solace on Abacus Recordings, Ion Dissonance once again toured Canada and the US. On Tuesday, June 20, 2006, Gabriel announced his departure from the band, citing personal issues and different interests in music. In October 2006, the band introduced their new vocalist, Kevin McCaughey, formerly of Shaolin. Kevin McCaughey (ID's second vocalist) joined in 2006, replacing original vocalist Gabriel McCaughry. In April 2007, Ion Dissonance recorded their third album, Minus the Herd. While the album was scheduled for release on June 5, 2007. There has been some controversy over this album dealing with the differences between old and new vocalist. The newer is generally considered to be heavier and missing some of the \\"chaos\\" from the older albums. After being in Western Europe for a tour with Through the Eyes of the Dead, they returned to Canada and the US for The Summer Slaughter Tour. In late August 2009, they announced that a new album is being written. In 2010, Ion Dissonance released their fourth album Cursed. About the album, Antoine Lussier of Ion Dissonance explained the band's intentions for Cursed were to pick up where they left off on their 2005 career-defining album, Solace. \\"After [Minus the Herd] we wanted to stick to the sound that we started with and we want to finish with it,\\" he says. \\"I think we really got a good picture of what our sound is supposed to be. I'm not saying it's the best sound ever, it's just the best picture of Ion Dissonance we've taken so far.\\" In December 2014, Ion Dissonance announced that Dominic Grimard from the band, The Last Felony will be taking over bass duties for Yannick Desgroseillers, due to unfortunate health issues on Yannick‚Äôs part. However, he is still involved with the band and helping with the recording process. This news came along with a new demo called, \\"Ill Will\\", their first new song since releasing Cursed. On November 18, 2016, Ion Dissonance released their fifth album Cast the First Stone on Good Fight Music.

Pigu≈Ça formed The Analogs in 1995 and, excluding the years he spent imprisoned, has been with the band non- stop since then as its primary songwriter. Initially he played bass guitar and provided backing vocals for The Analogs, but in 2008 he switched to lead guitar. In recent years Czeka≈Ça has also began occasionally performing as the lead singer on a very small fraction of the songs the band plays live, such as a cover of the classic \\"Skinhead Girl\\" song during a November 2019 concert in London where the band played alongside the famous ska artist Roy Ellis. In 2020 he started his own multi-genre vocal project called Pigu≈Ça Original. Biography =Early life= Pawe≈Ç Czeka≈Ça was born in 1970 and grew up in disadvantaged tower block residential areas of Szczecin during the economic troubles the Polish People's Republic was experiencing in the 1980s. It is also during this time that Czeka≈Ça became interested in punk rock music. He attended the Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi High School of Art in Szczecin. =Musical beginnings= From 1988 Pigu≈Ça performed vocals for the grindcore band Strawberry, with whom they self-released an album in 1989. He would later sing in the crossover thrash group D.E.I.M.O.S., which released an album in 1992 followed by a demo in 1993 before splitting up. Later in the 1990s, this time with a bass guitar in hand, he formed the short-lived Dr. Cycos with Marek ‚ÄúOre≈Ç‚Äù Adamowicz on the guitar and Ziemowit Pawluk playing the drums. Their 1996 cassette was one of the first ska releases in Poland. It was with these men that he would make a decision which would define much of his musical career. =The Analogs and run-ins with the law= It was in 1995, at the Bronx pub in Szczecin with Ore≈Ç and Pawluk, that Pigu≈Ça formed The Analogs ‚Äì a band that would go on to become a leading group of the street punk and Oi! genres in Poland. The band initially struggled with finding a suitable vocalist, with an early candidate being Tomasz Iwanow, but this did not work out and eventually Dominik Pyrzyna became the band's longtime singer. The band relatively quickly grew popular on the Polish punk scene and released three albums in its first three years of activity, continuing with nine more in the decade that followed. However, by the time the first album of The Analogs was released, Pigu≈Ça was serving a prison sentence for taking part in an organised criminal group; his time in jail, spread over two sentences that lasted almost five years in total, affected him deeply and made him turn his life around after being let back out; he would later reflect on his experiences in some of the lyrics of the band's songs, for which he was always the main writer. Upon leaving prison for the second time, Czeka≈Ça became straight edge dedicating his life to music and sports. In the 2000s Pawe≈Ç Czeka≈Ça also played in the hardcore bands The Hunkies and Street Chaos as well as the 1977-style punk group Anti Dread, but The Analogs remained his main focus. =Projekt Pud≈Ço= The Analogs continued to play with some membership changes over the years, but Pigu≈Ça remained a central figure within it as its bassist and songwriter as well as providing backing vocals. In 2008 he switched to lead guitar and Tomasz Majorek replaced him on the bass (the latter was replaced by Przemys≈Çaw \\"Benon\\" Kaczmarek in 2013). In 2011, Czeka≈Ça won two medals at the European Championship of Brazilian jiu-jitsu in Lisbon. The Analogs released ten more albums in the 2010s, continuing its popular live performances garnering attention both domestically and abroad. By 2018, Czeka≈Ça along with fellow The Analogs guitarist and main vocalist Kamil Rosiak began touring penitentiaries, correctional facilities, and drug addiction centres as a duet called Projekt Pud≈Ço to play acoustic versions of their well-known songs - not only as entertainment, but as part of a resocialisation process for the inmates and others. This campaign was deemed largely successful and received some attention in Polish media. In an August 2020 interview with Wirtualna Polska, Pigu≈Ça described it thus: Fundraisers, charity events, and tours around Polish jails culminated in the release of an acoustic album of the same name by The Analogs, which was successful and has gathered even more respect for the band on the scene as well as helping them continue Projekt Pud≈Ço live. =Hot16 and Disso Polo= In May 2020, friends nominated Pigu≈Ça to take part in the Hot16Challenge. Pigu≈Ça responded and, after seeing a highly controversial entry into the challenge by Polish far-right politician Janusz Korwin-Mikke, decided to dedicate his 16 verses of rap music against the far right in Poland. Pigu≈Ça's entry also stirred some controversy, with an overwhelmingly negative reaction from fascist and right-wing circles but a mostly positive response from the far left, who saw it as brave and a refreshing voice on the Polish left-wing that was seen as genuine, coming from a working-class background without being academic or elitist. Czeka≈Ça's entry into the challenge caused a number of other artists to step up and unite, with the result being a collaboration between 23 different artists (mostly from Poland, but also Belarus and Italy) releasing a new album called Disso Polo under Czeka≈Ça's Pigu≈Ça Original project at the end of July, 2020; the record has been described as a \\"musical rodeo\\", combining elements of hardcore punk, rapping, reggae, and other genres into one album that sends an anti- capitalist, anti-fascist, anti-homophobic, and environmentalist message. Pigu≈Ça wrote many of the lyrics, as well as performing the vocals and playing bass/guitar for many tracks. Alongside numerous others, participants in Disso Polo include Igor Bantser from Mister X and Mark Marlowski of Booze & Glory. Personal life Pigu≈Ça lives with his partner Weronika Korbal, whom he helps with her feline wellbeing group Kocie Warpno and label Oldschool Records; he is deeply attached to his cats, espouses left-wing views, and is an outspoken opponent of the Catholic Church in Poland. Sport and music have played an important part in his life, especially after leaving prison. Since the beginning of his musical career, Czeka≈Ça has been strongly opposed to racism in the skinhead and Oi! scene, recognising its Jamaican and multi-cultural roots.

He is best known as the long-time host of the Canadian sports talk show Prime Time Sports from its inception on October 2, 1989 to June 21, 2019. Career McCown made his broadcast debut in 1975 as host of a nightly sports talk show on Foster Hewitt's CKFH, where he had been working in its sales department since being hired the previous year. He would add to his resume in 1977, assuming adjunct employment as the public address announcer at Toronto Blue Jays' home games during their inaugural season. In 1981, Telemedia purchased CKFH, rebranded it as CJCL, and switched to an adult contemporary format. McCown left that same year for Global TV in Toronto where in November 1981 he would launch and anchor Sportsline, before moving on later in the decade to host TSN's The Business of Sports. As the 1980s progressed, as it became evermore popular, CJCL began devoting more time to sports talk programming. This culminated in the launch of Prime Time Sports, for which McCown was brought back to host, in 1988 Although the pilot episode aired on October 2, 1989, it was actually taped a year earlier in a bar in Etobicoke, and focused on Ben Johnson's positive test for steroids at that year's Seoul Olympics. CJCL completed its format change on September 4, 1993 when it rebranded as \\"The Fan 1430\\" and became Canada's first all-sports radio station. McCown was subsequently given his own morning program, The Bob McCown Show, while Dan Shulman took over as anchor of PTS. Nineteen ninety-five turned out to be one of the most tumultuous in McCown's career as he was fired only to be re-hired a month later to once again host PTS after Shulman left to become the Blue Jays' play-by-play announcer on TSN. McCown promptly took a 3-week vacation after hosting just one show upon his return on a Friday afternoon. For the rest of the decade, he would host PTS at times during winter from his Las Vegas home while simultaneously smoking and spending commercial breaks on his couch. Rogers Media purchased The Fan in 2002, and, two years later, began simulcasting PTS on Rogers Sportsnet, thereby allowing McCown to also become a fixture on television for the first time in his career. In 2007, McCown received a Sports Radio Award for \\"Air Talent Of The Year\\" at the Rick Scott & Associates Sports Radio ConferenceFrom Primetime Sports Episode on April 1, 2008 and published his first book, \\"McCown's Law: The 100 Greatest Hockey Arguments,\\" with co-author David Naylor. McCown launched fadoo.com in March 2009 with the goal to \\"provide a platform for dialogue and comment among people of power and influence in the sports world. And then, let everyone in on the conversation.\\" The website lasted just over a year before being removed in early June 2010. \\"It just didn't make business sense, anymore,\\" a source close the operation wrote in an e-mail message. It appeared McCown lost interest in the fadoo.ca site months ago with no posts, updates, or otherwise. In February 2012, he founded the similarly named Fadoo Productions Inc., a \\"multi-platform media company\\" focusing on \\"documentary and series production\\". It has produced several shows and series for television including \\"On The Edge,\\" \\"Making History\\" and \\"Touch 'em all Joe\\". In June 2013, McCown purchased Stoney Ridge Estate Winery, one of the oldest and most decorated wineries in the Niagara region. He also acquired a minority (15%) interest that year in Mike Weir Wines in Beamsville, Ontario, before buying full control in 2017. Mike Weir Wines was placed in receivership, owing $6.5 million ($2.2 to Weir and $4.3 to the Royal Bank of Canada), in February 2019. McCown has also been known for his 30-year standing bet with former Toronto Blue Jays president and CEO Paul Godfrey regarding an NFL team in Toronto. It was on a beach in the year of 1977 that the two men debated long hours about the subject. Godfrey to this day asserts that there will one day be an NFL team in Toronto, while McCown guarantees that there will not. Once a year or every so often, the debate is brought up again. McCown's last PTS show was broadcast on June 21, 2019. Prior to the broadcast, it was speculated that he would be retiring; however, on the day before its broadcast, he tweeted \\"Okay - I am leaving Prime Time Sports and Rogers. But nobody can shut me up when I still have things to say. Stay tuned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back!‚Äù. The Canadian Press reports that it is currently unknown if he chose to leave or was forced out, but McCown had just signed a multi-year contract extension in December 2017. Broadcast style Among his on-air trademarks on the show include his deadpan greetings to guest callers and his audience such as \\"Greetings. Salutations.\\", his constant use of rich vocabulary to describe things (referring to sportswriters as \\"ink-stained wretches\\"), his dry wit (which includes using such quips as \\"Who gives a flying fadoo?!\\", \\"Kicking ass, taking names\\", \\"Raising a Spockian eyebrow\\", \\"giddyup\\" and \\"Bite me!\\", referencing the fictional hockey players Claude and Orest Themalfachuk, and likening someone who is impatient to \\"Sonic the Hedgehog, tapping his foot\\"), and a pair of sunglasses he wears during the television simulcasts of Prime Time Sports. McCown is often indifferent about the fact that his radio show is simulcast on television, often saying during his introductions \\"also simulcast on Rogers Sportsnet for those of you who do not own radios\\" or \\"simulcast on Rogers Sportsnet in lieu of other programming\\". He has on many occasions maintained his stance against fighting in hockey (especially staged fights), hits to the head, and a strong aversion for the sport of soccer, much like his Los Angeles counterpart, Jim Rome. . However, when he has been pressed by his Prime Time Sports co-hosts Stephen Brunt and/or John Shannon McCown has said that Tottenham Hotspur of the English Premier League is the soccer team he supports.. Personal life McCown is known for his nickname, The Bobcat. It was given to him by Bill Watters in the 1980s who had originally called him Mercury Bobcat, after the popular 1970s subcompact car. McCown has maintained his residence between both Las Vegas and Toronto during the mid 1990s,http://www.sportsnet.ca/590/prime-time-sports/eight-takeaways-from- pantload/ though he has settled in Toronto over the past few years. Though born in the United States (his father Robert served in the USAF and stationed in Columbus, Ohio), he also grew up in Scarborough, Ontario as a child, playing house league in the Dorset Park neighbourhood and went to Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute with former Toronto Star reporter Dave Perkins.

Claude Black dies at age 92\\" , Carmina Danini and Edmund Tijerina, San Antonio Express-News obituary, 14 March 2009) was an American Baptist minister and political figure. Black was born in San Antonio, Texas, which was segregated at the time. Black's parents are Claude Sr., who served as the Vice President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and Cora Black, who was a housewife. Biography =Ministry= While attending Morehouse College in Atlanta, Black initially aspired to be a doctor, but was led to the ministry. He then attended Andover Newton Theological School. Black served as pastor of Mt. Zion First Baptist Church in San Antonio for 1949‚Äì98 and as pastor emeritus since. Previously, he had served as pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Haverhill, Massachusetts (1941‚Äì43) and St. Matthew Baptist Church in Corpus Christi, Texas (1946‚Äì49). Black founded several community groups as well as the city's first black credit union. He also served as chairmen of the Social Actions Committee with the National Baptist Convention and president of the Baptist Minister's Union of San Antonio. He worked through the community as a pastor of the community. = Civil rights activism = Black was known throughout the South for his activism in the Civil Rights Movement. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, he along with State Representative G. J. Sutton and Harry Burns led and organized marches throughout the state. He challenged former Texas Governor Price Daniel, former San Antonio Mayor Walter McAllister and the establishment for their unfair treatment of minorities in the city. While addressing a city council meeting in 1952, he was ignored and called a ------ on the open microphone. He became an associate of such leaders as A. Philip Randolph, Martin Luther King Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., James Farmer, Ella Baker and others. As a local ally to President Lyndon B. Johnson, Black was present for the White House Conference on Civil Rights in 1966. He endured many threats to himself, his family and even his church. In 1974, a drive-by shooting occurred at his home and his church burned, with no suspects being charged. Black supported the efforts of San Antonio branch of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), after a massive demonstration against police brutality in downtown San Antonio and an armed attack on the SNCC office. He allowed use of the church for meetings of the San Antonio Committee to Free Angela Davis, SNCC-Panther meetings, and allowed members of the SNCC-Panthers opportunities to raise funds at the church on Sunday. Rev. Black co-authored a city council resolution against the sale of the South African Krugerrand Gold Coin, in December 1976, before Nelson Mandela was released from prison. He served four terms of the San Antonio City Council, 1973‚Äì78, and became the city's first black Mayor Pro Tem.  Legacy  Black was married to ZerNona Black (1912‚Äì2005) for a total of 59 years. He was predeceased by his adopted daughter Joyce (1952‚Äì1992), son Stewart (1931‚Äì1994) and three grandchildren. San Antonio has a street, shopping plaza, and community center named in honor of Black. The city of San Antonio created the Rev. Claude and ZerNona Black Scholarship Endowment Fund. Black also served on the Advisory Council of Wayland Baptist University's San Antonio campus; the campus named its award given to the outstanding student earning the Master of Christian Ministry degree in his honor. On November 30, 2006, Black was honored with an extravagant 90th Birthday gala, which was hosted by both the city of San Antonio. Guest included Martin Luther King III, Fred Shuttlesworth, Henry Cisneros, Percy Sutton and Phil Hardberger. Black's autobiography Grandpa was a Preacher: A Letter to my Grandson was published in 2006. It was co-written with his grandson Taj Matthews. The MLK Realizing the Dream Foundation honored Rev. Black in Washington during Inauguration Week along with Congressman Ted Kennedy, Congressman John Lewis and activist, humanitarian Aung San Suu Kyi. Black was present at some of King's civil rights speeches, including his famous I Have a Dream speech.  Death  Black died on March 13, 2009 in San Antonio, Texas, following a lengthy illness.

McCartney is currently the list manager at the Greater Western Sydney Giants.  AFL career  McCartney began his career at the Collingwood Football Club amid a huge reputation from his junior football days. He could play at either end of the ground as a key position forward or backman. After McCartney left the Magpies after four seasons from 1991 to 1994, he switched to Adelaide, with whom he had a good debut season in 1995. He missed out most of the year due to the strength of the team in 1997, therefore missing the Crows' first premiership triumph. So he moved to North Melbourne, where he played in the 1998 losing Grand Final against the Crows. In 1999 he once again had the opportunity to play in a Grand Final, but was suspended during the preliminary final against Brisbane saying that it was the worst day of his life, and went on to miss the Roos' premiership triumph that year. He then played in the team that made a losing preliminary final in 2000, which was the last finals match he played, and could have been considered unlucky, considering circumstances, to have never played in a premiership. In 2002 he had a poor season after being forced to fill the key forward role vacated by champion Wayne Carey who did not compete in the 2002 season having left the club following a sex scandal with Anthony Stevens' wife.  Bali bombings  On 12 October 2002, McCartney was a victim of the Bali bombing near the Sari Club. He was drinking at a nearby pub called Paddy's Bar when the bomb exploded, causing McCartney and his companion, fellow AFL footballer Mick Martyn, to suffer the impact of the blast. Martyn escaped with minor burns, while McCartney suffered severe second degree burns to over 50% of his body. McCartney initially thought his burns were minor and set about saving those around him instead of worrying about himself. He considered others to be in more pain than he was, and had to be taken on a special chartered flight back to Melbourne along with other victims. When he arrived the injuries turned out to be severe and McCartney almost died during surgery. He was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his support to other victims. What followed was a long rehabilitation process. McCartney stated that his objectives were to marry his fianc√©e Nerissa, as planned, and also to return to AFL football. The comeback was seen as an almost impossible task. Return to AFL football He married fianc√©e Nerissa Vanderheyden on 14 December, just 63 days after the bombings. Throughout 2003, McCartney rehabilitated with the intention of regaining his place in the Kangaroos on merit. Following an early season thigh strain, McCartney eventually played seven games with the Kangaroos' then-VFL affiliate Port Melbourne before gaining senior selection. On 6 June 2003, McCartney returned to the AFL. Playing for the Kangaroos against Richmond, McCartney was heavily bandaged, wore a long-sleeved top and had to wear protective gloves. McCartney wore the numbers \\"88\\" and \\"202\\" on his guernsey ‚Äì 88 representing the number of Australians who died in the Bali bombing, and 202 the total number of deaths, with many in the crowd also holding up the numbers on signs. McCartney had the modest statistics of 3 kicks, 1 mark and 1 goal, 1 behind. He booted a goal early in the final quarter, but with the Kangaroos trailing by less than a goal late in the game, McCartney dished off the ball to Leigh Harding, who scored the winning goal with seconds remaining. In a real twist to the night, McCartney announced his retirement from AFL football during his on-field post-match interview, citing that his road back had left him spent and that he preferred to leave on a high note. To this day, it is considered one of the most inspirational sports-related stories in Australia, with Fox Footy's AFL: The Greatest ranking it as #7 on its list of the biggest AFL news stories of all-time.AFL: The Greatest ‚Äì News Stories YouTube (originally produced by Fox Footy) The image of McCartney being chaired off the ground after the game is captured in Jamie Cooper's painting the Game That Made Australia, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport.Australian Football League, The Game That Made Australia , Retrieved 19 September 2010  Post-retirement  As of 2003, the Jason McCartney Medal has been awarded to the player judged most courageous on field in games between Collingwood and North Melbourne. Following his retirement, McCartney wrote After Bali, which recounted his ordeal. He is also a prominent motivational speaker on the public speaking circuit around Australia. He was an assistant coach at the Calder Cannons in the TAC Cup in 2009 and joined Fremantle as a development coach for the 2011 season. He then moved back to Melbourne to be the Western Bulldogs' list manager at the end of 2011. He left this role post the 2017 season and moved to Sydney to be the GWS Giants list manager.

Greek text and English translation in Scott Kennedy,Two Works on Trebizond, Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library 52 (Cambridge: Harvard University, 2019), p. 7 Although some consider her Manuel's second wife, Michel Kur≈°anskis has argued that Rusudan may have been simply his mistress.Kur≈°anskis, \\"L'usurpation de Th√©odora Grande Comn√®ne\\", Revue des √©tudes byzantines, 33 (1975), pp. 198f Kur≈°anskis also notes that the evidence is insufficient to determine if Theodora was identical with one of the princesses of Trebizond mentioned in the Chronicle of Bishop Stephanos who married a noble or the king of Georgia, or if she had been a nun -- much as Anna Anachoutlou was before her usurpation in the following century.Kur≈°anskis, \\"L'usurpation\\", p. 200.

Shortly afterwards she was defeated and John regained his throne, but she had managed to reign long enough to have minted her own coins.

The McKenzie Highway was added to the National Register of Historic Places in February, 2011. This highway was the original routing of U.S. Route 28 through the Oregon Cascades until 1952, when it was redesignated as part of U.S. Route 126 (now Oregon Route 126). This highway was built in the 1920s and was the only highway over the Cascades going east out of Eugene until 1962, when a gravel road heading north from Belknap Springs to U.S. Route 20 at Santiam Junction was widened and paved. At that point, the new alignment was designated as US 126, and the old alignment was renamed OR 242. OR 242 is now considered primarily a scenic route. As a result, it is not plowed or sanded, and is thus closed during winter‚Äîgenerally from November 1 until about the July 1 every year, although snows have closed it as early as Labor Day in the past. Snow packs of up to fourteen feet are common on the summit of the road; snow gates are located east of the junction with OR 126 at Belknap Springs, and west of Sisters. This is the 2nd highway in Oregon to have the designation OR 242. The earlier OR 242 was located in the Willamette Valley and connected U.S. Route 99E (now Oregon Route 99E) in Woodburn with Oregon Route 219 southeast of St. Paul. This incarnation of OR 242 existed between 1932 and sometime after 1951, when it was replaced with an extended Oregon Route 214. Later, OR 219 was redirected along most of this route to end on Interstate Route 5 in Woodburn, and OR 214 was truncated to the same interchange. History =Current designation= What is now OR 242 was a wagon route over the Cascade Range. It was built in 1862. The highway for automobiles was constructed in 1924. In the original plan for the U.S. Numbered Highway plan on November 11, 1926, U.S. Route 28 (US 28) was designated from Florence to Ontario. US 28 followed the alignment of OR 242. The American Association of State Highway Officials approved to change US 28 between Eugene and Prineville to US 126 in 1951. In 1962, the Clear Lake Cutoff was completed. The completion resulted in US 126 being rerouted from McKenzie Pass to the cutoff. The rerouting included a concurrency with US 20\\\\. After the rerouting, the OR 242 designation was formed on the McKenzie Pass route. In February 2011, OR 242 was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In September 2011, McKenzie Pass was designated as an Oregon Scenic Bikeway Major intersections Gallery File:Oregon Route 242.jpgFall Colors File:Oregon Route 242 Scenic Vista.jpgScenic Vista File:Oregon Route 242 Lava Beds.jpgLava Beds File:Dee Wright Observatory (Deschutes County, Oregon scenic images) (desDB1726).jpgDee Wright Observatory References Category:1962 establishments in Oregon Category:Deschutes National Forest Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon Category:Historic trails and roads in Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Deschutes County, Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lane County, Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Linn County, Oregon Category:Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon 242 Category:Transportation in Deschutes County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Lane County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Linn County, Oregon Category:Willamette National Forest ","title":"Oregon Route 242"},{"id":"3423027","text":"Ethel du Pont Roosevelt-Warren (January 30, 1916 - May 25, 1965) was an American heiress and socialite and a member of the prominent du Pont family.

CCM magazine described their music as \\"pure punk for dread people,\\" stating that it was a cross between Janes Addiction and Charlie Mingus. History =Sin Disease era= Scaterd Few initially existed from 1983 until 1984 with a brief stint in 1985. Led by Allan Aguirre, then known as R√§mald Domkus, the band recorded an 11-song demo with Terry Scott Taylor (of Daniel Amos fame) as producer in June 1983. Some of the material from this time was later released on their disk Out of the Attic. Being unable to sell the material at the time, Scaterd Few went on hiatus in 1985 and Allan left to produce music with another band, Cygnet. This band became the blueprint for Allans' later goth- themed work, Spy Glass Blue. In 1989, Allan began work on Scaterd Few material again with brother/original bassist Omar Domkus. Working with Terry Taylor and Gene Eugene, their first new material was released in 1990 on Alarma Records. Sin Disease was critically well received, though its lyrical content and rumors (of being Rastafarian and not traditional Christian) caused a national pull from Zondervan. The band played Christian festivals such as Cornerstone, but they didn't limit themselves to Christian venues. They toured with secular artists such as Bad Brains, and would play at explicitly non-Christian events such as an Earth First event. The band ran into further trouble in 1991 when, in an interview, Aguirre admitted to smoking pot. These factors led to the band being dropped from Alarma's roster. =Indie existence= Their next effort at making an album, which eventually resulted in the 1994 release of Jawboneofanass, was a direct result of the aftermath of Sin Disease. The album was recorded three times. The first time, the band again worked with Gene Eugene and Terry Taylor. This recording was made for the general market under the auspices of Vox Vinyl. The second recording was done with Dave Hackbarth (of the band Undercover) and Terry Taylor for Mike Knott's Blonde Vinyl. Neither of these versions were released. The third version was produced independently with assistance from Mark Rodrieguez of Mortal / Blood fame. The release coincided with the release of Out of the Attic on Flying Tart Records. Out of the Attic is a compilation of material from Scaterd Few's early existence - the 1983 to 1984 time frame. The release shows the roots of Scaterd Few in early 1980s punk rock. The sound is raw and rough, but clearly shows the origin of many of the Few's later sounds. In the winter of 1995, their manager, Tim Cook, secured a recording contract with Tooth & Nail Records. Artistic direction and personality differences between members caused the band to part ways in early 1996. Allan immediately started working on new material and Spy Glass Blue was officially born. In 1998 Allan once again rebuilt Scaterd Few with an all new lineup, and Grandmother's Spaceship was released on Jackson Rubio. Their most recent material, Omega No. 5, was released in 2002 on Allans' own label, Accidental Sirens. Style Though a Christian band, Scaterd Few's songs are filled with lyrics about topics that many Christians feel are inappropriate for Christian music. Scaterd Few never received any significant music industry awards, and received relatively little attention in mainstream media. The manner in which the band displayed their Christianity guaranteed them neither a place on Christian bookstore shelves nor automatic distribution in general-market outlets. However, the transparent reality and introspective honesty of their lyrics have earned the band a devoted fanbase. The themes of their lyrics fall into two broad categories - Teaching about Christianity, and teaching about human behavior. Christianity themes include: Sin is a disease and mans' need for salvation (\\"Beggar\\", \\"While Reprobate\\", \\"Run If You Can\\", and \\"Wonder Why\\"), Mans' vs. God's understanding (\\"Beggar\\", \\"Life Bleeds Out\\", \\"Holding Stare\\", \\"Self\\", and \\"Pinnacle\\"), and a person's need for growth as a Christian (\\"Sleeper\\" and \\"Lullaby\\"). Human behavior themes include gang violence and racial issues (\\"Lights Out\\"), drug use (\\"Glass God (No Freedom In Basing)\\"), sexual immorality (\\"Sheets\\", \\"Future Love\\", \\"Secret - Secret\\", and \\"Resistance\\"), and religious sects, Witchcraft, and apostasy (\\"Pinnacle\\", \\"Witchcraft\\", \\"Resistance\\", and \\"Self\\"). Their sound was derived from the Los Angeles punk rock scene of the 1980s, and has been described as a \\"Shotgun wedding between complex musicianship and scathing punk rock\\". Their Sin Disease era influence would be primarily Bad Brains musically.

Led by Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the Republic of China. These divisions were active in the Chinese Civil War and Second Sino-Japanese War. Background In 1927, after the dissolution of the First United Front between the Nationalists and the Communists, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party) purged its leftist members and largely eliminated Soviet influence from its ranks. Chiang Kai-shek then turned to Germany, historically a great military power, for the reorganisation and modernisation of the NRA. The Weimar Republic sent advisors to the Republic of China, but because of the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, they could not serve in military capacities. Chiang initially requested famous generals such as Ludendorff and von Mackensen as advisors - the Weimar Republic turned him down, fearing that they were too famous, would invite the ire of the Allies, and would result in the loss of national prestige for such renowned figures to work, essentially, as mercenaries. Max Bauer was the first advisor sent to China. When Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and disregarded the Treaty, the anti-communist Nazi Party and the anti- communist KMT were soon engaged in cooperation with Germany training Chinese troops and expanding Chinese infrastructure, while China opened its markets and natural resources to Germany. In 1934 General Hans von Seeckt, acting as advisor to President Chiang, proposed a \\"80 Division Plan\\" for reforming the entire Chinese army into 80 divisions of highly trained, well-equipped troops organised along German lines. The plan was never fully realised, as the vying warlords could not agree upon the reorganised division organization and the disbanding of the others. By July 1937 only 8 infantry divisions had completed reorganisation and training. These were the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 14th, 36th, 87th, 88th, and the Training Division. Another 12 divisions equipped with Chinese arms on the reorganized model with German advisors had some training by the time the Second Sino-Japanese War started in July 1937. These Divisions were the 2nd, 4th, 10th, 11th, 25th, 27th, 57th, 67th, 80th, 83rd, 89th Infantry Divisions. =Structure of proposed division= Reorganized Division organization: Was to be composed of approximately 14,000 personnel organized in to: * Division headquarters troops:  1 Artillery battalion: * 3 Artillery companies (12 x 75 millimeter mountain artillery guns in batteries of 4)  1 Anti Tank artillery company (4 x 37mm AT gun)  1 Anti-aircraft gun company (4 x 20mm anti-aircraft guns)  1 Military Engineer Battalion  1 Signal battalion * 2 Wire communications companies * 1 Wireless correspondence platoon  1 Heavy Transport Battalion  1 Special duty Battalion (Special Operations Battalion)  1 medical team (usually is a Division hospital) * 2 Infantry Brigades of:  each with 2 infantry regiments, Each Regiment consisted of: * Regimental headquarters troops:  1 Mortar company (6 x 81 millimeter mortars)  1 Small artillery company (6 x 20 millimeter autocannon)  1 Communications company  1 Regimental recon company * 3 infantry battalions each of:  Infantry battalion headquarters troops  3 Infantry companies of: * 3 rifle platoons of  3 squads (each of 1 light machine gun, 10 rifles)  1 heavy Machinegun company (6 heavy machine guns, 2 x 82 millimeter mortars) Each Division was to have two Home Regiments to provide trained Infantry replacements.

It is the highest degree of environmental protection for the assigned areas, which are strictly protected and with access by the public restricted. Overview The literal English translation of zapovednik is \\"nature sanctuary\\" (like animal sanctuary); however, in practice zapovediks sometimes have to do with the protection of things other than nature and can incorporate historical‚Äìcultural, historical‚Äìarchaeological, and other types of cultural or natural heritage. They also function as important sites for historical research and education and so are comparable to the Sites of Special Scientific Interest as found in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. The term zapovednik, which refers to the reserve, staff and infrastructure, was used in the former Soviet Union and is still in use in the Russian Federation and in some of the other former Soviet republics. Many reserves have areas with different degrees of protection; sometimes grazing is permitted to a certain extent. Other types of protected areas include national nature parks, zakazniks (referring to \\"state game reserve\\" because a limited amount of hunting is allowed there), nature monuments (often individual trees, geological exposures, or other small areas), etc. Some zapovedniks are recognized as biosphere reserves (or sanctuaries). In Russia there are 101 zapovedniks covering about , or about 1.4% of the country's total area. They include everything from isolated patches of steppe to large tracts of Siberia and the Arctic, and range in size from Galich'ya Gora at 2.31 km2 (570 acres) to the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve at . The Russian Ministry of Natural Resources oversees 99 of the zapovedniks. The exception is Il'menskiy, which is administered by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Galich'ya Gora, administered by Voronezh State University.Tsentr dickoy prirody Theory of zapovednost' The theoretical justification for the zapovedniks is known as zapovednost' (–∑–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å) ‚Äì meaning \\"the state of being protected in a zapovednik\\". It was developed in the 1890s and early 20th century, principally by the soil biologist V. V. Dokuchaev. The fundamental idea of zapovednost' is the exclusion of people and the prohibition of economic activity, the only exceptions being non-intrusive access allowed to scientists and rangers.Shtilmark (2003) p.2. Zapovedniks are intended to be parcels of untouched natural ecosystems that can be studied as standards with which to compare managed ecosystems, such as are created in agriculture and forestry.Weiner (2000), p.91. To this end, zapovedniks need to be large enough to be self-sufficient, with a complete range of trophic levels up to the top predators.Shtilmark (2003), pp.12-13. In 1910 the theory of zapovednost' was taken a step forward by I. P. Borodin, who argued that zapovedniks should not be established piecemeal, but as a planned system of reserves including samples of all the main natural regions in the country.Shtilmark (2003), pp.17-18. In the 1940s Aldo Leopold understood the need for zapovednik-type reserves: \\"While even the largest wilderness areas become partially deranged, it required only a few wild acres for J. E. Weaver to discover why the prairie flora is more drought-resistant than the agronomic flora which has supplanted it.\\" The answer was that the wild prairie had a much more complex, and more efficient, root system, and this could only have been discovered by studying the undisturbed natural ecosystem.Leopold (1968), pp.196-7. Of course it would be difficult, if not impossible, to establish a 'perfect' zapovednik today, entirely natural and self-sufficient, especially in view of downstream effects involving pollution and greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, many Russian zapovedniks are a good approximation to the ideal and have been operating as scientific institutions for many decades. History The first zapovedniks were set up in the steppe region of the Russian Empire in the 1890s. Some were equipped with research stations. Dokuchaev was the guiding spirit behind these early zapovedniks. Areas of steppe were chosen for the first zapovedniks because of the rapid disappearance of virgin steppe as it was ploughed up, and because it was thought that ploughing might be exacerbating the effects of drought; clearly, research was needed in order to understand the steppe and how it could be best exploited.Shtilmark (2003), pp.10-13;Weiner (2000), p.12. The applied-science motivation for setting up zapovedniks was continued in the first state- organized zapovednik. Barguzin Nature Reserve was established by the tsarist government in 1916 on the eastern shore of Lake Baikal. Its purpose was to protect and study a population of sable ‚Äì a valuable fur species that was declining due to over-hunting.Shtilmark (2003), p.25. Other zapovedniks appear to have been set up at about the same time but either lapsed (e.g. Sayan) or did not receive formal recognition until later.Kedrovaya Pad'Shtilmark (2003), pp.24-25. Lenin's nationalization of the land in 1917 and 1918 created a legally favourable environment for the Soviet zapovednik system since securing areas of land for this purpose from private owners was no longer a problem.Shtilmark (2003), p.29. Lenin may have had an interest in nature protection because permission was granted promptly for the creation in 1919 of Astrakhan Zapovednik in the Volga Delta on the north-western shore of the Caspian Sea.Shtilmark (2003), p.30; Weiner (2000), p.27. The recognition of zapovedniks was put on a firm legal footing by a measure \\"On the Protection of Nature Monuments, Gardens and Parks\\", signed into law by Lenin in 1921.Shtilmark (2003), p.34; Weiner (2000), p.28. The creation of zapovedniks continued, but the measure also allowed for the establishment of national parks, though none were set up in the Soviet Union for another half century. By 1933 there were 15 state zapovedniks in Russia,Weiner (2000), p.251. and by 1995, there were 115. The average area of new zapovedniks declined from 780 km2 in 1916‚Äì25 to 110 km2 in 1936‚Äì45, and then rose to 5,060 km2 in 1986‚Äì95.Shtilmark (2003), p.206. In 2007 there were 101 operating zapovedniks, reflecting a small number of new ones opened since 1995, but also two periods of closures and contraction of the system. The first of these was planned by Aleksandr Malinovskii; it was carried out in 1951 with a view to turning the zapovedniks into \\"commercial-and-research\\" institutions as well as releasing substantial areas of protected forest for commercial exploitation.Shtilmark (2003), p.118; Weiner (1999), p.102. Over the next 10 years the zapovednik system recovered somewhat, but in 1961 Nikita Khrushchev criticized it, famously referring to a film about them Altay Zapovednik in which a scientist was shown watching a squirrel gnawing a nut.Shtilmark (2003), p.135; Weiner (1999), p.296. Six zapovedniks were closed and others were amalgamated or reduced in area.Shtilmark (2003), p.137. Although in theory a zapovednik is an extensive area of unspoilt natural ecosystems used for scientific research with a residential staff of scientists and rangers, the history of many zapovedniks has in fact been rather different, sometimes involving closure, exploitation (including the felling of forest), and eventual reopening. Even so, some zapovedniks have had an almost unblemished history and most retain the original vision of being scientific research institutions not open to public recreation.  Environments protected  Map of zapovedniks in Russia It is not easy to summarize the coverage of ecosystems protected by zapovedniks, but a rough idea can be gained by counting the number of reserves in the main natural-vegetation zones. On the map these are, from north to south: *Arctic desert (treeless; no continuous vegetation cover) and tundra (treeless; small shrubs, sedges, mosses) *taiga (coniferous boreal forest with admixture of birch and other deciduous trees) *deciduous forest (discontinuous zone dominated by oak and other deciduous species) *steppe (treeless, dominated by forbs in the north and grasses in the south). This is a highly simplistic classification. Each major zone is divided into subzones, and there are transitional vegetation types. Moreover, many zapovedniks, especially if in a transitional zone or covering a range of altitudes, will contain examples of several vegetation types. With those qualifications, the numbers of zapovednik sites (some zapovedniks occupy widely dispersed sites, some of which are here counted separately) in the different zones are as follows: Arctic desert and tundra ‚Äì c.15; taiga ‚Äì c.40; deciduous forest ‚Äì c.13; steppe ‚Äì c.30. About half a dozen are predominantly montane, especially in the Caucasus. Komandorsky and Wrangel Island are remote islands. A few are mainly wetlands. Management and uses Although the principle of zapovednost' stipulates no economic use, in practice zapovedniks have often been required to contribute to the national economy. Voronezh Zapovednik, for instance, bred European beavers for reintroduction to other areas in support of the fur industry.Shtilmark (2003), p.71. Several zapovedniks have also been regarded as a breeding ground for other commercially valuable fur-bearing animals, such as sable and desman, allowing them to spread into neighboring unprotected areas to support commercial trapping.Shtilmark (2003), p.67. Non-intervention management is difficult to practise in steppe zapovedniks, which are often far too small to support a self-sustaining ecosystem including wild herbivores (such as saiga) that may have been migratory. Resort is sometimes made to various mowing regimes, which however cannot satisfactorily replace natural processes insofar as it does not recycle nutrients and organic matter through the herbivore and carnivore food chain, and cannot replicate trampling effects. An important activity in all zapovedniks is regular monitoring of seasonal events (phenology). This is now standardized in a programme of observations known as the Chronicle of Nature (–õ–µ—Ç–æ–ø–∏—Å—å –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥—ã). The name was suggested by Aleksandr Formozov in 1937 although a monitoring programme was being developed by V.N.Sukachev in 1914 and Grigorii Kozhevnikov in 1928.Shtilmark (2003), pp.67, 84, 96; Volkov (1996), p.9. Instructions for conducting the Chronicle of Nature are periodically updated.Filonov & Nukhimovskaya (1990). Under the pressure to become self-financing, some zapovedniks have tried at various times to develop ecological tourism - usually in the reserve's buffer zone, so avoiding infringement of the principle of zapovednost'. In some cases tourism does however become a serious problem on account of the proximity of recreation centres, e.g. at Teberdinsky Zapovednik in the Caucasus. The Dombai recreation center, long a favorite Russian alpine skiing destination, is located near the center of the zapovednik, and the impact of tourism in the area as more Russians and foreigners come to visit has created pressure on the preserved ecosystems around it. International significance of the zapovednik system The anthropogenic impact on the environment - due to pollution, climate change and ultimately human population growth - is generating increasingly serious problems, the solution of which will depend on a better understanding of the biosphere than we already have. To provide conditions in which such an understanding can be developed, it is essential to preserve as far as possible intact examples of natural ecosystems, and the zapovedniks are the only large system of protected areas created primarily for this purpose. In the case of soil erosion, for example, it is only by comparing soil formation and loss rates from intact steppe or prairie and from the same kind of land under intensive agriculture that we can appreciate how destructive of natural capital the latter often is.Montgomery (2007), pp.150-8, 172-4. Regular long- term monitoring of natural phenomena in zapovedniks has also provided a baseline set of data which is now valuable for assessing how anthropogenic pressure, primarily through climate change, is affecting natural ecosystems. Since the latter perform essential functions such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, it is obviously important to know how these ecosystem services are being affected by anthropogenic pressure.Kokorin et al. There is an argument for establishing a well funded global network of zapovedniks in order to increase our understanding of anthropogenic pressures on all the natural ecosystems of the world.

Lonnie Theodore Binion (November 28, 1943 ‚Äì September 17, 1998) was a wealthy U.S. gambling executive and one of the sons of famed Las Vegas casino magnate Benny Binion, owner of Binion's Horseshoe. His death has been a subject of controversy; girlfriend Sandra Murphy and her lover Rick Tabish were initially charged and convicted in Binion's death, but were later granted a new trial and acquitted on the murder charges. Early life Ted Binion was born in Dallas in 1943. He had an older brother, Jack, and three sisters: Becky, Brenda, and Barbara. Binion moved to Las Vegas with his father in 1946. He was involved early on in his father's casino, the Horseshoe. While growing up, Ted spent summers at the family's Montana retreat, a cattle ranch in Jordan, to work with the ranch hands. Later, in the early 1960s, Benny sent his three grandsons‚Äîhis daughter Barbara‚Äôs sons‚Äîto Montana to work on the ranch. By the 1980s, Benny had amassed an ranch, according to the county recorder‚Äôs office. The last parcel he purchased was in 1985. The family sold all the parcels in April 1998 to John Hillenbrand. Career In 1964, Benny Binion regained full control of the Horseshoe after previously selling his interest to cover his legal costs defending himself from tax evasion and other charges. Since he was a convicted criminal, Benny was no longer allowed to hold a gaming license. His sons Jack and Ted--aged only 23 and 21, respectively ‚Äî took over the day-to-day operation of the casino, while Benny remained on the payroll as a \\"consultant.\\" Jack became president of the Horseshoe, while Ted became casino manager. For the next 30 years, Ted was the face that was most seen during the peak evening hours of the casino operation and became well known as the host of the Horseshoe's poker tournaments. Binion loved living the high life and partying, schmoozing with high-profile guests of the Horseshoe, and flirting with attractive women. He was arrested in 1986 on drug trafficking charges and began drawing attention for his connection to organized crime figure \\"Fat Herbie\\" Blitzstein. From that point on, Binion was in hot water with the Nevada Gaming Commission. Besides his drug problems and association with mob figures, the Nevada Gaming Control Board suspected that he was using his live- in girlfriend, Sandy Murphy, as a bagwoman. Binion had met Murphy while she was working at Cheetah's, a topless club. His dalliances with her had caused his estranged wife and daughter to pack up and leave for Texas. In 1996, he was provisionally banned from any management role in the Horseshoe and had to undergo regular drug testing. For the duration of his suspension, he was banned from even entering his family's casino. He struggled to avoid falling afoul of Commission drug tests, and at one point shaved off every hair on his body to avoid a hair test that would reveal his history of usage. In May 1997, Binion's gaming license was suspended after it was found he had violated the agreement. In March 1998, after the Commission learned that Binion was associating with Chicago Outfit figure Herbert \\"Fat Herbie\\" Blitzstein, it voted unanimously to permanently revoke Binion's license. Binion was the first person to lose his license for violating a Nevada regulation that bans gaming licensees from associating with known criminals. He was never to be associated with the family business again. Inside the basement of the casino was Ted's silver collection, housed in a floor-to-ceiling vault at the Horseshoe Club. When Ted‚Äôs ties to the family casino were severed, he had to either sell the silver or relocate it to a secure spot. After Binion lost his license and the family sold the Montana ranch, he became even more involved in drugs, especially marijuana, Xanax, and the street drug tar heroin, which he smoked. He was known to \\"chase the dragon\\" (inhale the smoke). The dealers knew when he was around due to the telltale odor of marijuana smoke whenever he used the eye in the sky to keep an eye on the action. Personal life Binion was once the target of a near-kidnapping, a dramatic attempt that left bodies strewn across the desert. Later in life, he developed a severe heroin addiction. He was an avid reader of magazines and books. He was a history buff, particularly American Civil War history, and enjoyed watching History Channel and Discovery Channel programming. In addition, he was mathematically gifted - easily able to mentally calculate odds or the \\"house take\\" in gambling transactions with no aid. He was known to help people he knew to be in difficult financial straits.Crime Library profile of the Binion case Buried treasure After his death, it was discovered by Nye County sheriff's deputies that Ted had had a 12-foot-deep vault built on the desert floor on a piece of property he owned in Pahrump, west of Las Vegas. The concrete bunker contained six tons of silver bullion, Horseshoe Casino chips, paper currency, and more than 100,000 rare coins, including Carson City silver dollars‚Äîmany in mint condition‚Äîestimated to be worth between $7 million and $14 million‚Äîthat were once housed in the Horseshoe vault. The Pahrump underground vault would play a major role in the investigation into Binion's death. After Ted Binion was banned from the casino, he contracted construction of the underground vault with MRT Transport, a trucking company owned by Rick Tabish. MRT trucks were used to transport the silver to the vault, and the only two people who had the combination to the vault were Binion and Tabish. The vault was discovered two days after Binion died, whereupon Nye County sheriff's deputies arrested Binion's associate Rick Tabish and two other men unearthing the silver. Binion hid millions in and around his Las Vegas home, all of which went missing after his death. It is rumored to be buried on the property under odd mounds in the front and back yards. After the trial much of the silver was given to his daughter, who had some of it offered for sale to the public. A large portion still remains unclaimed at the courthouse.48 Hours: Buried Secrets of Las Vegas CBS News Death and aftermath Ted Binion was found dead on a small mattress on the floor of his Las Vegas estate home, 2408 Palomino Lane near Rancho Drive and Charleston Boulevard, on September 17, 1998. Empty pill bottles were found near the body, and an autopsy and toxicology report revealed that he died of a combination of the prescription sedative Xanax and heroin, with traces of Valium. The day before, Binion had himself purchased 12 pieces of tar heroin from a street drug dealer, and had earlier gotten a prescription from his next-door neighbor, a doctor, for Xanax, and evidence introduced at trial showed that Binion personally took the prescription to a local pharmacy to be filled. Binion's death was initially treated as a probable suicide. His live-in girlfriend, Sandy Murphy, said that Binion had been suicidal ever since losing his gaming license a few months earlier. His sister Barbara, afflicted with the same kinds of drug problems as her brother, had committed suicide in 1977, which also helped contribute to the perception that Ted could have been vulnerable to suicide as well. However, his sister Becky discounted any talk of suicide, saying that in her conversations with him he did not sound despondent. Las Vegas homicide detectives suspected that the scene had been staged, as his body did not show the typical signs of a drug overdose. Also, the stomach contained heroin and the police thought that neither an addict nor a suicide would take heroin in that manner. However, despite the urgings of Becky Behnen and Jack Binion, they refused to open a full-scale homicide investigation. Six months later, chief medical examiner Lary Simms ruled Binion had died of a heroin and Xanax overdose. After six months, however, the Clark County Coroner's office reclassified Ted's death a homicide on May 5, 1999. Although there were no specifics, law enforcement sources cited evidence that the death scene had been staged, as well as witness statements implicating Murphy and Tabish. Detectives had suspected for some time that Murphy and Tabish had been romantically involved, and had learned that Binion suspected Murphy was cheating on him. In June 1999, Sandy Murphy and Rick Tabish were arrested for Binion's murder, as well as for conspiracy, robbery, grand larceny and burglary. The prosecution contended that Murphy and Tabish had conspired to kill Binion and steal his wealth, drugging Binion into unconsciousness and burking him, a form of manual suffocation. The suffocation, in this theory, which was presented at trial by forensics pathologist Michael Baden, who testified for the prosecution, was done because the overdose was taking too long, and the pair feared discovery. They were each charged with murder and burglary charges connected to the removal of his fortune from the vault on the desert floor in Pahrump. A police report that was not used in the first trial by Rick Tabish's first attorney Louie Palazzo revealed that a drive-by shooting occurred on June 5, 1997, in front of Ted Binion's Palomino Lane home. Included in the police report about the late night incident is a statement by Ted Binion alleging that Chance LeSueur and Benny Behnen were the shooters. Murder trial and re-trial Judge Joseph Bonaventure, by courtroom artist Paulette Frankl. The case attracted national media attention. After two months of trial, Murphy and Tabish were found guilty, after nearly 68 hours of deliberation. Tabish was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, while Murphy received 22 years to life. Later that year, David Roger, who prosecuted the case, was elected Clark County district attorney, and David Wall, who second-chaired the prosecution, was elected district judge. However, in July 2003, the Nevada Supreme Court overturned the murder convictions, ruling that Clark County District Court Judge Joseph Bonaventure erred in deliberation instructions to the jury. The justices found that Tabish should have received a separate trial for the assault and blackmail of another businessman. While the prosecution was never able to prove a link between this crime and Binion's murder, the justices said, testimony regarding the separate assault prejudiced the jury against Tabish. The justices also ruled that jurors should have been told to consider statements by Binion's estate attorney as statements of the attorney's mind, not fact. The defendants were granted a new trial, which began on October 11, 2004 in Judge Bonaventure's courtroom. This time, Murphy, who was represented by Michael Cristalli, and Tabish, represented by famed civil rights lawyer J. Tony Serra, and local Las Vegas attorney Joseph Caramagno, were each acquitted of murder but were convicted on lesser charges of burglary (12 to 60 months) and grand larceny (12 to 60 months) connected with the Binion case. Tabish also was convicted of use of deadly weapon (18 to 60 months). Murphy was sentenced to time served and did not return to prison. Tabish was originally sentenced to serve consecutive terms and was denied parole in 2001, 2004 and 2005. On January 26, 2009 he was brought into Las Vegas where the Nevada parole board granted him \\"Parole to Consecutive,\\" meaning the three convictions were to run concurrently.Nevada Department of Corrections - Tabish, Rick Offender Detail Record Tabish received another parole hearing in Las Vegas on January 13, 2010. The Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners announced January 26, 2010 that Tabish, 44, would be granted parole. His younger brother described the news as ‚Äúpretty wonderful.‚Äù Tabish was released on May 18, 2010. His parole started on April 2, 2010, but negotiating the terms of his release delayed his actual exit from prison. Print and electronic media A prosecution death theory, which the jury ultimately rejected, formed the basis for \\"Burked\\", a September 27, 2001 episode of the TV series CSI. After the jury in the re-trial found Tabish and Murphy not guilty of murder news accounts reported that jurors had been unwilling to find them guilty because the forensic evidence introduced by the prosecution had not met the standards of the television show. The case was covered extensively in Death in the Desert,Death in the Desert: The Ted Binion Homicide Case, Cathy Scott; published 2000 () a biographical true crime book by author Cathy Scott, in Positively Fifth StreetPositively Fifth Street, James McManus; published 2003 () by James McManus, which is about a poker tournament at the Binion family's Horseshoe, and in An Early Grave, by Gary C. King and released in 2001 as part of the 'St. Martin's True Crime Classics' series. The case was also covered in the 2008 made-for-TV movie Sex and Lies in Sin City, originally said to be based on the book Murder in Sin City by columnist Jeff German which took the prosecution's point of view. However, the movie title and storyline were changed to allow for other theories about Binion's death. Las Vegas columnist John L. Smith published a pictorial summary of the case titled Quicksilver. A&E; aired an hour-long video about the case titled Who Wants to Kill a Millionaire, which is part of its \\"American Justice\\" series, and includes interviews and film clips of the characters surrounding Binion's death and aftermath. The second edition of Death in the Desert, released in 2012, covers the re-trial and acquittals, as well as An Early Grave's re- release in 2005 with appendices about the re-trial and acquittals. Coverage can also be found at trutv.com under \\"Ted Binion\\" and in the 48 Hours Mystery episode \\"Buried Secrets of Las Vegas.\\" The TV show \\"On the Case\\" covered the case in its episode #12, aired November 22, 2009.

Water retention curve is the relationship between the water content, Œ∏, and the soil water potential, œà. This curve is characteristic for different types of soil, and is also called the soil moisture characteristic. It is used to predict the soil water storage, water supply to the plants (field capacity) and soil aggregate stability. Due to the hysteretic effect of water filling and draining the pores, different wetting and drying curves may be distinguished. The general features of a water retention curve can be seen in the figure, in which the volume water content, Œ∏, is plotted against the matric potential, \\\\Psi_m. At potentials close to zero, a soil is close to saturation, and water is held in the soil primarily by capillary forces. As Œ∏ decreases, binding of the water becomes stronger, and at small potentials (more negative, approaching wilting point) water is strongly bound in the smallest of pores, at contact points between grains and as films bound by adsorptive forces around particles. Sandy soils will involve mainly capillary binding, and will therefore release most of the water at higher potentials, while clayey soils, with adhesive and osmotic binding, will release water at lower (more negative) potentials. At any given potential, peaty soils will usually display much higher moisture contents than clayey soils, which would be expected to hold more water than sandy soils. The water holding capacity of any soil is due to the porosity and the nature of the bonding in the soil. Curve Models The shape of water retention curves can be characterized by several models, one of them known as the van Genuchten model: :\\\\theta(\\\\psi) = \\\\theta_r + \\\\frac{\\\\theta_s - \\\\theta_r}{\\\\left[ 1+(\\\\alpha \\\\psi)^n \\\\right]^{1-1/n}} where :\\\\theta(\\\\psi) is the water retention curve [L3L‚àí3]; :\\\\psi is suction pressure ([L] or cm of water); :\\\\theta_s saturated water content [L3L‚àí3]; :\\\\theta_r residual water content [L3L‚àí3]; :\\\\alpha is related to the inverse of the air entry suction, \\\\alpha >0 ([L‚àí1], or cm‚àí1); and, :n is a measure of the pore-size distribution, n>1 (dimensionless). Based on this parametrization a prediction model for the shape of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity - saturation - pressure relationship was developed. History In 1907, Edgar Buckingham created the first water retention curve. It was measured and made for six soils varying in texture from sand to clay. The data came from experiments made on soil columns 48 inch tall, where a constant water level maintained about 2 inches above the bottom through periodic addition of water from a side tube. The upper ends were closed to prevent evaporation. Method The van Genuchten parameters (\\\\alpha and n) can be determined through field or laboratory testing. One of the methods is the instantaneous profile method, where water content \\\\theta (or effective saturation Se) are determined for a series of suction pressure measurements \\\\psi. Due to the non-linearity of the equation, numerical techniques such as the non-linear least-squares method can be used to solve the van Genuchten parameters. The accuracy of the estimated parameters will depend on the quality of the acquired dataset (\\\\theta and \\\\psi). When water retention curves are fitted with non-linear least squares, structural overestimation or underestimation can occur. In these cases, the representation of water retention curves can be improved in terms of accuracy and uncertainty by applying Gaussian Process regression to the residuals that are obtained after non-linear least-squares. This is mostly due to the correlation between the datapoints, which is accounted for with Gaussian Process regression through the kernel function. Yousef, B. (June, 2019).

The committee was led by the famous Yiddish actor Solomon Mikhoels. Bregman was born in the town of Zlynka in the Chernigov Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Bryansk Oblast of Russia). Bregman had been a deputy minister of State Control and an active party member since 1912, when he was also appointed a Deputy Commissar of Foreign Affairs. He was editor-in- chief of The Book About Jews-Heroes of the War against Fascism. He also participated in collecting materials for Black Book, a publication detailing the extermination of the Jews of the Soviet Union by the Germans and their collaborators during World War II. He joined JAC in 1944 when he was also recruited as an informant of the secret service MGB. He was arrested together with other members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in 1948. Having never admitted his guilt, \\"I had no involvement in the Crimea question and could not have had any involvement at presidium sessions,\\" he declared to the trial judge. He died in jail of heart disease on January 23, 1953. After surviving severe beatings he had fallen into a deep coma on 16 June, in which state he remained when the death sentence was passed on all of his comrades. Among their number only Lisa Shtern was spared.

Dietmar von Aste: Alternative names used in the early literature for Dietmar von Aist are Dietmar von Aste or von Ast, as depicted above in the \\"Konstanz-Weingartner Liederhandschrift\\" (written around 1310-1320 in the monastery St. Martin at Weingarten near Ravensburg). The unicorn served as heraldic animal for Dietmar. Life One Dietmar von Aist is mentioned by name from about 1139 onwards in contemporary records from Salzburg, Regensburg and Vienna. The surname probably refers to the Aist River, a left tributary of the Danube below the confluence with the Enns. Since about 1125 the noble family von Aist is evidenced in the M√ºhlviertel region (present-day Upper Austria), where today the ruins of the ancestral seat stand on the Aist River. The Upper Austrian Aistersheim water castle was first mentioned in 1159 together with Freiherr (Baron) Dietmar von Aist, a ministerialis of the Babenberg ruler Henry II of Austria. If he is really identical with the poet is not completely certain on chronological grounds. A certain Ditmarus de Agasta mentioned in further records, who died childless about 1171, is possibly the same as Dietmar von Aist. Dietmar is also referred to in the 1220s poem Diu Cr√¥ne by Heinrich von dem T√ºrlin. Works A whole series of songs is ascribed to Dietmar, but his authorship can be clearly decided in only a few cases. With those verses which can be attributed to him without any doubt, he belongs in the earliest period of the Minnesang. Dietmar von Aist and his work represent the link between the uncourtly and the courtly forms. He was one of the first poets to use the refrain and the Tagelied form Wechsel. The themes of his songs are mostly to do with the relationship of men to women (love, parting, partnership), in which connection it is worth noting that some of his poems are written from the female perspective and others from the male. The woman takes a decidedly strong position: for example, she is to be able to choose her own partner freely - cf the poem Ez stuont ein frouwe alleine - There stood a woman alone (eLib Austria; full text in the original). The first surviving Tagelied is also by Dietmar: Sl√¢fest du, friedel ziere? (Are you asleep, dearest one?).

These disputes have grown beyond simple business disputes into transnational political issues‚Äîinvolving political leaders from several countries‚Äîthat threaten natural gas supplies in numerous European countries dependent on natural gas imports from Russian suppliers, which are transported through Ukraine. Russia provides approximately a quarter of the natural gas consumed in the European Union; approximately 80% of those exports travel through pipelines across Ukrainian soil prior to arriving in the EU. A serious dispute began in March 2005 over the price of natural gas supplied and the cost of transit. During this conflict, Russia claimed Ukraine was not paying for gas, but diverting that which was intended to be exported to the EU from the pipelines. Ukrainian officials at first denied the accusation, but later Naftogaz admitted that because of harsh winter (lower than minus 30C) some natural gas intended for other European countries was retained and used for domestic needs. Ukraine said it will still meet its contractual transit obligations. The dispute reached a high point on 1 January 2006, when Russia cut off all gas supplies passing through Ukrainian territory. On 4 January 2006, a preliminary agreement between Russia and Ukraine was achieved, and the supply was restored. The situation calmed until October 2007 when new disputes began over Ukrainian gas debts. This led to reduction of gas supplies in March 2008. During the last months of 2008, relations once again became tense when Ukraine and Russia could not agree on the debts owed by Ukraine. In January 2009, this disagreement resulted in supply disruptions in many European nations, with eighteen European countries reporting major drops in or complete cut-offs of their gas supplies transported through Ukraine from Russia. In September 2009 officials from both countries stated they felt the situation was under control and that there would be no more conflicts over the topic, at least until the Ukrainian 2010 presidential elections. However, in October 2009, another disagreement arose about the amount of gas Ukraine would import from Russia in 2010. Ukraine intended to import less gas in 2010 as a result of reduced industry needs because of its economic recession; however, Gazprom insisted that Ukraine fulfill its contractual obligations and purchase the previously agreed upon quantities of gas. On 8 June 2010, a Stockholm court of arbitration ruled Naftohaz of Ukraine must return of gas to RosUkrEnergo, a Swiss-based company in which Gazprom controls a 50% stake. Russia accused Ukrainian side of diverting gas from pipelines passing through Ukraine in 2009. Several high-ranking Ukrainian officials stated the return \\"would not be quick\\". Russia plans to completely abandon gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine after 2018.Gas Pipelines to Europe by 2018. Russian News Agency \\"TASS\\".Gas supplies to bypass Ukraine from 2019 ‚Äî Gazprom. Russian News Agency \\"TASS\\". 2014-01-28. Gazprom has already substantially reduced the volumes of gas it transits across Ukraine, and expressed its intention of reducing the level further by means of transit diversification pipelines (Nord Stream, Turkish Stream, etc.). Historical background After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, oil import prices to Ukraine reached world market levels in 1993. However, gas import prices and transit fees remained below European levels for Russian exports to Europe through pipelines in Ukraine; these were set in bilateral negotiations. At the same time Ukraine remained the main transit corridor for Russia's gas export. In 2004‚Äì2005, 80% of Russian gas exports to the European Union were made through Ukrainian territory. Two- thirds of Gazprom's revenue comes from the sale of gas that crosses Ukraine. Ukraine's own annual gas consumption in 2004‚Äì2005 was around , of which around were produced domestically, were bought from Turkmenistan, and were received from Russia in exchange for transport of Russian natural gas. The remaining were purchased from Russia. The gas trading system differed substantially from the gas sale to the European Union and caused problems in the form of large- scale deliveries of relatively cheap Russian gas causing an increase of energy-intensive industries and supporting Ukraine's status as one of the world's least energy-efficient countries and largest gas importers, the accumulation of Ukrainian debts and non-payment of same, unsanctioned diversion of gas and alleged theft from the transit system, and Russian pressure on Ukraine to hand over infrastructure in return for relief of debts accumulated over natural gas transactions. Gas trading was conducted under a framework of bilateral intergovernmental agreements which provided for sales, transit volumes, gas prices, gas storage, and other issues such as the establishment of production joint ventures. Commercial agreements were negotiated between the relevant companies within the guidelines and dictates of that framework and supplemented by annual agreements specifying exact prices and volumes for the following year. Gas sales prices and transit tariffs were determined in relationship to each other. Commercial agreements and trade relations have been non-transparent and trade has been conducted via intermediaries such as Itera, EuralTransGaz, and RosUkrEnergo. RosUkrEnergo's involvement in the Russian-Ukrainian gas trade has been controversial. There are allegations that the company is controlled by Semion Mogilevich and its beneficiaries include strategically placed officials in the Russian and Ukrainian gas industries and governmental structures related to the energy sector.According to former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Timochenko, RosUkrEnergo is controlled by Semion Mogilevich. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has made accusations that RosUkrEnergo is owned by a business ally of Ukraine's ex-president, Viktor Yushchenko. The Ukrainian investigation into RosUkrEnergo, during Yulia Tymoshenko's first term as Prime Minister, was closed after she was fired by Yushchenko in September 2005. According to a contract between Gazprom and Naftogaz signed on 21 June 2002, payment for the transfer of Russian natural gas through the Ukrainian pipeline system had been made in exchange for no more than 15% of the gas pumped through Ukrainian territory to be taken in lieu of cash. This contract was supposed to be valid until the end of 2013. On 9 August 2004, the two companies signed an addendum to the contract, according to which the amount of gas given as a payment was calculated based on a tariff of US$1.09 for the transportation of 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas over a distance of ; the addendum further stated the price of the natural gas supplied to Ukraine was to be $50 per 1,000 cubic meters (approximately $1.40 per million Btu). This price was constant notwithstanding the gas prices in the European markets. According to the addendum the price was not subject to change until the end of 2009. Gazprom argued that this addendum was only applicable provided that the two countries sign an annual intergovernmental protocol that has higher legal status for specifying the terms of gas transit. According to Gazprom, the addendum becomes void as the annual protocol had not been signed for 2006 under the required terms. Russia claimed that Gazprom's subsidies to the Ukrainian economy amounted to billions of dollars. According to the agreement of 2006, RosUkrEnergo was to receive no more than 20 percent of the total delivered gas, which in 2007 was of . Disputes of the 1990s Initial disputes concerning gas debts and non-payment appeared immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. As a result of disputes over non-payments by Ukraine, Russia suspended natural gas exports several times between 1992 and 1994. This led to the illicit diversion of Russian natural gas exports from transit pipelines by Ukrainian companies and institutions in September 1993 and November 1994. The diversion of gas was acknowledged by Ukraine, while accusations of other diversions were disputed. In September 1993, at a summit conference in Massandra, Crimea, Russian President Boris Yeltsin offered to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to forgive Ukrainian debts in return for control of the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. After a strong negative reaction from politicians in Kyiv, the idea was abandoned. An intergovernmental agreement was drafted on gas issues, including a clause stating Ukraine would permit Gazprom to participate in the privatization of Ukrainian enterprises in gas and other sectors. In March 1994, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister agreed with Russia that Gazprom could acquire a 51% stake in the pipeline system. In early 1995, Russia and Ukraine agreed to create a joint company, Gaztransit, to operate Ukraine's natural gas transit infrastructure in exchange for the cancellation of a substantial portion of Ukraine's debts to Russia. These agreements were never implemented, and in November 1995, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, adopted a law prohibiting the privatization of oil and gas assets. In 1998, Gazprom and Naftohaz made a contract under which Gazprom would pay for the transit of volumes of gas, which established a link between gas prices and transit tariffs, but this contract did not resolve the issue of already incurred gas debts. In 1998, Gazprom alleged that Ukraine had illegally diverted gas meant for export to other European countries and suspended exports of oil and electricity to Ukraine in 1999. Gazprom also claimed that Ukraine's gas debt had reached $2.8 billion. In 2001, Deputy Prime Minister Oleh Dubyna acknowledged that in 2000 alone of Russian natural gas had been diverted from export pipelines. The debt issue was settled on 4 October 2001, by the signing of an intergovernmental agreement on Additional Measures Regarding the Provision of Transit of Russian Natural Gas on the Territory of Ukraine (the 2001 Transit Agreement). Dispute of 2005‚Äì2006 Then President of Russia Vladimir Putin at a meeting on 29 December 2005, with Alexei Kudrin (Russian Finance Minister), Viktor Khristenko (Russian Energy Minister), Alexander Medvedev (Deputy Chairman of the Gazprom board), Ivan Plachkov (Ukrainian Energy Minister) and Alexey Ivchenko (CEO of Naftohaz), in which the dispute was discussed. In 2005, negotiations over gas prices for 2006 started. Gazprom insisted on a new price of $160 per 1,000 cubic meters. The Government of Ukraine agreed, with the stipulation that price increases were to be gradual, in return for increased gas transit fees and changing the method of payment for transit from payment in kind to cash.Russian newspaper Kommersant daily, Tuesday, 29 March 2005 In May 2005, it was revealed that of gas which Gazprom had deposited in Ukrainian storage reservoirs during the previous winter had not been made available to the company. It remained unclear if the gas was missing, had disappeared due to technical problems, or had been stolen. This issue was resolved in July 2005 by agreement between Gazprom, Naftohaz and RosUkrEnergo, according to which Naftohaz received of gas as partial settlement of the Russian gas transit over 2005 services and was sold by Gazprom to RosUkrEnergo who has to receive it from Naftohaz. However, the negotiations between Gazprom and Naftohaz over gas prices and a new gas supply agreement failed. On 1 January 2006, Gazprom started reducing the pressure in the pipelines from Russia to Ukraine. Although Russia cut off supplies only to Ukraine, a number of European countries saw a drop in their supplies as well. The European Commissioner for Energy Andris Piebalgs and several affected member states warned that blocking of gas deliveries was unacceptable. Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization, expressed the opinion that all Post-Soviet states should pay market prices for their energy needs in order to improve the efficiency of their economies. The supply was restored on 4 January 2006, after the preliminary agreement between Ukraine and Gazprom was settled. The five-year contract was signed, although with prices set for only six months. According to the contract, the gas was sold not directly to Naftohaz, but to the intermediary Russian-Swiss company RosUkrEnergo. The price of natural gas sold by Gazprom to RosUkrEnergo rose to $230 per 1,000 cubic metres, which, after mixing it in a proportion of one-third Russian gas to two-thirds cheaper supplies from Central Asia, was resold to Ukraine at a price of $95 per 1,000 cubic metres. The parties also agreed to raise the tariff for transit from US$1.09 to US$1.60 per 1,000 cubic meters per 100 km; this applied not only to the transit of Russian gas to Europe, but also Turkmen gas through Russia to Ukraine. On 11 January 2006, Presidents Vladimir Putin and Viktor Yushchenko confirmed that the conflict had been concluded. One possible reason for this conflict is the more pro-NATO and European Union- style approach of the new \\"orange\\" government of Ukraine. Russia disagreed, stating they did not want to subsidize former Soviet republics. Dispute of 2007‚Äì2008 Then President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko at a meeting of the Russian‚ÄìUkrainian Intergovernmental Commission at the Kremlin on 12 February 2008, at which the gas dispute was discussed. On 2 October 2007, Gazprom threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine because of unpaid debt of $1.3 billion. This dispute appeared to be settled on 8 October 2007. On 5 January 2008, Gazprom warned Ukraine that it would reduce its gas supplies on 11 January if $1.5 billion in gas debts were not paid. Presidents Putin and Yushchenko announced on 12 February 2008, an agreement on the gas issue. Ukraine would begin paying off its debts for natural gas consumed in November‚ÄìDecember 2007 and the price of $179.5 would be preserved in 2008. The presidents also decided to replace RosUkrEnergo and UkrGazEnergo with two new intermediaries, creating them as joint ventures of Gazprom and Naftogaz. At the end of February 2008, Gazprom threatened to reduce the supply of natural gas to Ukraine beginning on 3 March 2008, unless the pre-payment for 2008 was paid. The Ukrainian government said it paid for the natural gas which was consumed in 2007, but refused to pay the bill for 2008. A Gazprom spokesman claimed that the bill for of gas deliveries to Ukraine valued around $600 million remained unpaid. Ukraine disagreed as that debt accumulated in recent months when Russia used its own gas to make up for a shortfall in less expensive Central Asian gas. On 3 March, Gazprom cut its shipments to Ukraine by 25% and an additional 25% the next day, claiming that the $1.5 billion debt still was not paid, although Ukrainian officials stated it had indeed been paid. Gas supplies were restored on 5 March after Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller and Naftohaz CEO Oleh Dubyna agreed during negotiations by phone on a settlement. On 6 March, the Ukrainian cabinet refused to execute the gas agreements made by presidents Yushchenko and Putin. The Ukrainian cabinet did not want to pay in advance for 2008, and it opposed the creation of a Naftohaz‚ÄìGazprom venture that would sell gas in Ukraine. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko stated that Ukraine did not need any additional joint ventures, and as of 1 March 2008, UkrGazEnergo is no longer operating in Ukraine's domestic gas market. Dispute of 2008‚Äì2009 Vladimir Putin and Viktor Yushchenko (12 February 2008) The gas crisis of 2009 began with a failure to reach an agreement on gas prices and supplies for 2009. Ukraine owed a debt of $2.4 billion to Gazprom for gas already consumed, and Gazprom requested payment before the commencement of a new supply contract. In December 2008, despite Ukraine's repayment of more than $1 billion of its debt, Gazprom maintained its position, intending to cut the supply of natural gas to Ukraine on 1 January 2009, if Ukraine did not fully repay the remainder of $1.67 billion debt in natural gas supplies and an additional $450 million in fines levied by Gazprom. On 30 December, Naftohaz paid $1.522 billion, of the outstanding debt, but the two parties were not able to agree on the price for 2009. Ukraine proposed a price of $201, and later increased their proposed price to $235, while Gazprom demanded $250 per 1,000 cubic meters. Negotiations between Gazprom and Naftohaz were interrupted on 31 December. On 1 January 2009, exports to Ukraine of 90 million cubic meters of natural gas per day were halted completely at 10:00 MSK. Exports intended for transhipment to the EU continued at a volume of 300 million cubic meters per day. President Yushchenko requested that the European Union become involved in the settlement of this dispute in a letter to the President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso. A Ukrainian delegation including Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Prodan, Deputy Foreign Minister Konstantin Yeliseyev, the President's Representative for Energy Issues Bohdan Sokolovsky, and Deputy Head of Naftohaz Vadym Chuprun visited the Czech Republic as the first stop on a tour of a number EU member states to hold consultations on the gas crisis. On 2 January 2009, Hungary, Romania, and Poland reported that pressure in their pipelines had dropped. Bulgaria also reported that their natural gas supply was dropping, affecting the shipment of natural gas to Turkey, Greece, and Macedonia. Furthermore, the United Kingdom Government announced that it was preparing to enter its gas reserves after gas pressure had dropped from the continent. The crisis provoked strong political reactions in the region. On 4 January 2009, both RosUkrEnergo and Gazprom filed lawsuits against Ukraine and Naftohaz respectively with the Stockholm Tribunal of the Arbitration Institute. Ukraine also filed lawsuits with the tribunal. According to Naftohaz, RosUkrEnergo owes the company $40 million for services in transportation of natural gas. On 5 January 2009, Kyiv's economic court banned Naftohaz from transshipping Russian natural gas in 2009 at the price of $1.60 per 1,600 cubic meters per 100 kilometers. The court declared contracts made by Naftohaz for the transit of natural gas through Ukraine void because the contracts were signed by Naftohaz without authorization from the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. On 30 March 2010, the Stockholm tribunal ordered Naftohaz to pay RosUkrEnergo around $200 million as a penalty for various breaches of supply, transit, and storage contracts. On 8 June 2010, the tribunal ordered Naftohaz to return of natural gas to RosUkrEnergo. The tribunal further ordered that RosUkrEnergo would receive from Naftohaz a further of natural gas in lieu of RosUkrEnergo's damages for breach of contract.Stockholm court obliges Naftogaz to return 12.1 billion cubic meters of gas to RosUkrEnergo, Kyiv Post (8 June 2010)\\"BYuT publishes documents on sales of disputed 11 billion cubic meters of gas by Gazprom to Naftogaz\\", Kyiv Post (25 June 2010) On 5 January 2009 Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin instructed Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller to reduce natural gas exports to Europe via transshipment through Ukraine by quantities equivalent to the amounts of gas which Ukraine had allegedly diverted from the pipelines since deliveries ended on 1 January 2009. On 7 January, all Russian natural gas exports via Ukraine were halted amid accusations between the two parties. Several countries reported a major fall in supplies of Russian gas starting on 7 January; Bulgaria, Moldova, and Slovakia were among the most affected by these supply drops. Talks between Naftohaz and Gazprom resumed overnight on 8 January 2009. Ukraine agreed to guarantee the unfettered transport of natural gas on the condition that Gazprom would guarantee and supply technical gas for Ukraine's gas transit system to function; this was denied by Russia. The supplies to Europe were not restored although the European Union, Ukraine, and Russia agreed to the deployment of an international monitoring group to the gas metering stations between Russia and Ukraine. Naftohaz blocked the transit of gas, blaming a lack of pressure in the pipeline system and saying the design of the Soviet-built pipeline meant it could not ship gas entering through the Sudzha metering station governing gas leaving through the Orlivka metering station without cutting off the Donetsk region, Luhansk region, and portions of the Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine. Naftohaz suggested a technically more feasible alternative through the Valuyki and Pisarevka metering stations but was refused. Signing of the deal reached at the Moscow summit on 19 January 2009, by Oleh Dubyna and Alexei Miller (with Yulia Tymoshenko and Vladimir Putin standing in the background) On 17 January 2009, Russia held an international gas conference in Moscow. The EU was represented by the Presidency, the Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Martin ≈ò√≠man, and the EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs, so that the European Union could speak with one voice. Ukraine was represented by the Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. The conference did not achieve any solution to the crisis, and the negotiations continued bilaterally between Prime Ministers Putin and Tymoshenko. Early on 18 January 2009, after five hours of talks, Putin and Tymoshenko reached a deal to restore gas supplies to Europe and Ukraine. Both parties agreed that Ukraine would start paying European prices for its natural gas, less a 20% discount for 2009, and that Ukraine would pay the full European market price starting in 2010. In return for the discounts for 2009, Ukraine agreed to keep its transit fee for Russian gas unchanged in 2009. The two sides also agreed not to use intermediaries. On 19 January 2009, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller and the head of Naftohaz Oleh Dubyna signed an agreement on natural gas supply to Ukraine for the period of 2009‚Äì2019. Gas supplies restarted on 20 January 2009, and were fully restored on 21 January. According to the EU Commission and Presidency, the Russia‚ÄìUkraine gas disputes caused irreparable and irreversible damage to customers' confidence in Russia and Ukraine, causing Russia and Ukraine to no longer be regarded as reliable partners. According to reports, due to the gas crisis Gazprom lost more than $1.1 billion in revenue for the unsupplied gas. Ukraine also incurred losses as a result of the temporary closure of its steel and chemical industries due to the lack of gas. Ukraine also lost $100 million of potential revenue in transit fees from natural gas. There were also accusations of illegal diversion of natural gas by Ukraine; however, these accusations were not confirmed. The issue of technical gas used to fuel compressor stations and to maintain gas pressure in the pipeline network remained unclear. Some sources asserted that the responsibility for providing the technical gas falls to Ukraine, while others say that this is the responsibility of Gazprom. There were several theories as to alleged political motives behind the gas disputes, including Russia exerting pressure on Ukrainian politicians or attempting to subvert EU and NATO expansions to include Ukraine. Others suggested that Ukraine's actions were being orchestrated by the United States. Both sides tried to win sympathy for their arguments fighting a PR war. In August 2009, it was agreed that loans worth $1.7 billion would be given to Ukraine to help it provide stable supplies of Russian gas to Europe by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in return for reforms in Ukraine's gas sector. On 28 December 2009, the Slovakian government announced that Russia warned it would stop oil supplies to Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic over a transit price dispute with Ukraine. However, the next day, Ukraine's Naftohaz issued a statement confirming that Russia agreed to a 30% increase in the transit fees through Ukraine. The alleged rise in the tariff would be from $7.8 to $9.50 (or ‚Ç¨6.6) per tonne of oil going through Ukraine in 2010. Additionally, unlike previous payments, new payments would be made in Euros as this was one of Ukraine's demands. Russia and Ukraine also agreed on the volume of oil to be transported through Ukraine. The overall amount of oil to be transported to Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Hungary through Ukraine in 2010 will be 15 million tonnes‚Äîa decrease from 17.1 million tonnes in 2008. 2010 natural gas agreement =Prologue= After meeting her Russian counterpart Putin, Ukrainian Prime Minister Tymoshenko declared on 3 September 2009, \\"Both sides, Russia and Ukraine, have agreed that at Christmas, there won't be [any halt in gas supplies], as usually happens when there are crises in the gas sector. Everything will be quite calm on the basis of the current agreements\\". Tymoshenko also said that the Ukrainian and Russian premiers had agreed that sanctions would not be imposed on Ukraine for the country buying less gas than expected and that the price of Russian gas transit across Ukraine may grow 65% till 70% in 2010. A week before Gazprom had said it expected gas transit fees via Ukraine to rise by up to 59% in 2010. On 8 October 2009 Tymoshenko announced that Ukrainian 2010 natural gas imports will be significantly less than in previous years \\"because we have less need for natural gas\\". Because of its economic recession the industries require far less gas. In response to Tymoshenko Gazprom Chief Executive Alexey Miller stated that Ukraine should stick to the January (2009) contract for 2010.

Dispute of 2013‚Äì2014 =Annexation of Crimea= In February 2014, Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz sued Chornomornaftogaz for delayed debt payments of 11.614 billion UAH (almost ‚Ç¨1 billion) in the Economic Court of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. In March 2014, Republic of Crimea authorities announced that they would nationalize the company. Republic of Crimea deputy prime minister Rustam Temirgaliev said that Russia's Gazprom would be its new owner. A group of Gazprom representatives, including its head of business development, has been working at the Chornomornaftogaz head office since mid-March 2014. On 1 April, Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak said that Gazprom would finance an undersea gas pipeline to Crimea. On 11 April 2014 the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that it had added Chornomornaftagaz to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List as part of the third round of U.S. sanctions. Reuters quoted an anonymous U.S. official who explained that the United States wanted to make it impossible for Gazprom to \\"have dealings with Chornomorneftegaz\\", and if that were to happen, Gazprom itself could face sanctions. The European Union followed suit on 13 May 2014, the first time its sanctions list has included a company (in addition to Chornomorneftegaz, a Crimean oil supplier called Feodosia was also included). =June 2014 gas supplies to Ukraine cut off= In an attempt at energy independence, Naftogaz signed a pipeline access deal with Slovakia's Eustream on 28 April 2014. Eustream and its Ukrainian counterpart Ukrtransgaz, owned by Naftogaz, agreed to allow Ukraine to use a never used (but aging, at 20 years old) pipeline on Slovakia's eastern border with Uzhhorod in western Ukraine. The deal would provide Ukraine with 3 billion cubic meters of natural gas beginning in autumn of 2014 with the aim of increasing that amount to 10 billion cubic meters in 2015. On 1 April 2014 Gazprom cancelled Ukraine's natural gas discount as agreed in the 17 December 2013 Ukrainian‚ÄìRussian action plan because its debt to the company had risen to $1.7 billion since 2013. Later that month the price \\"automatically\\" jumped to $485 per 1,000 cubic meters because the Russian government annulled an export-duty exemption for Gazprom in place since the 2010 Kharkiv Pact (this agreement was denounced by Russia on 31 March 2014State Duma approves denunciation of Russian-Ukrainian agreements on Black Sea Fleet, Information Telegraph Agency of Russia (31 March 2014)). On 16 June 2014 Gazprom stated that Ukraine's debt to the company was $4.5 billion. On 30 May 2014 Ukraine paid $786 million to Gazprom.Russia and Ukraine Keep Talks Alive in Gas Feud, The New York Times (30 MAY 2014) After intermediary (that had started in May 2014) trilateral talks between EU Energy Commissioner G√ºnther Oettinger, Ukraine and Russia failed on 15 June 2014 the latter halted (after a deadline of 10 a.m. Moscow time passed without it receiving payment) its natural gas supplies to Ukraine the next day.Ukraine crisis: Russia halts gas supplies to Kiev, BBC News (16 June 2014) Unilaterally Gazprom decided that Ukraine had to pay upfront for its natural gas. The company assured that its supplies to other European countries would continue.Ukraine crisis: Russia halts gas supplies to Kiev, BBC News (16 June 2014) Ukraine vowed to \\"provide reliable supply of gas to consumers in Ukraine and we will provide reliable transit to the European Union‚Äù.Russia Cuts Gas to Ukraine While Maintaining Flow to EU , Bloomberg News (16 June 2014) At the time about 15 percent of European Union's demand depended on Russian natural gas piped through Ukraine. After trilateral months of talks between the European Union, Ukraine and Russia a deal was reached on 30 October 2014 in which Ukraine agreed to pay (in advance) $378 per 1,000 cubic metres to the end of 2014, and $365 in the first quarter (ending on 31 March) of 2015. Of its debts to Gazprom Ukraine agreed to pay of $1.45bn immediately, and $1.65bn by the end of 2014. It was agreed that the European Union will be acting as guarantor for Ukraine's gas purchases from Russia and would help to meet outstanding debts (using funds from existing accords with the European Union and IMF). The total package was worth $4.6bn.Russia‚ÄìUkraine gas deal secures EU winter supply, BBC News (31 October 2014) Ukraine secures winter gas supplies from Gazprom, Kyiv Post (31 October 2014) According to European Union officials the deal secured that there would be no natural gas supply disruptions in other European countries. November 2015 gas supplies stop On 25 November 2015 Gazprom halted its exports of Russian natural gas to Ukraine.Ukraine closes airspace to all Russian planes, BBC News (25 November 2015) According to the Ukrainian government they had stopped buying from Gazprom because Ukraine could buy natural gas cheaper from other suppliers. According to Gazprom it had halted deliveries because Ukraine had not paid them for the next delivery. Since then, Ukraine has been able to fulfil its gas supply needs solely from European Union states. In 2018 the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce ordered that Ukraine's Naftogaz should import 5 billion cubic meters of gas annually from Russia, as required under its 2009 contract with Russia's Gazprom. However, take-or-pay claims by Gazprom for 2009‚Äì2014 untaken gas volumes were rejected. On 28 February 2018, the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce ordered that Gazprom pay Naftogaz for failing to ship certain amounts of gas through Ukraine gas transmission system. The net result of all claims was that Gazprom was ordered to pay Naftogaz $2.56 bln. Gazprom disputed this award and fought it off in several European courts where Naftogaz was trying to enforce the award. In the end, a settlement of principle was reached in Berlin on 20 December 2019 as part of wider trilateral talks between Gazprom, Ukraine and the European Commission on Russian gas transit through Ukraine. Public reaction in Ukraine Political pressure from Russia to Ukraine led to the emergence of a public campaign to boycott Russian goods in Ukraine during the gas conflict of 2005‚Äì2006. Active actions in the campaign also continued in early 2009‚Äîduring the gas war of 2008‚Äì2009.

For example, the word that may be called a complementizer in English sentences like Mary believes that it is raining. The concept of complementizers is specific to certain modern grammatical theories; in traditional grammar, such words are normally considered conjunctions. The standard abbreviation for complementizer is C. The complementizer is often held to be the syntactic head of a full clause, which is therefore often represented by the abbreviation CP (for complementizer phrase). Evidence that the complementizer functions as the head of its clause includes that it is commonly the last element in a clause in head-final languages like Korean or Japanese, in which other heads follow their complements, whereas it appears at the start of a clause in head-initial languages such as English, where heads normally precede their complements. Types and development It is common for the complementizers of a language to develop historically from other syntactic categories (a process known as grammaticalization). Across the languages of the world, it is especially common for pronouns or determiners to be used as complementizers (e.g., English that). Another frequent source of complementizers is the class of interrogative words. It is especially common for a form that otherwise means what to be borrowed as a complementizer, but other interrogative words are often used as well; e.g., colloquial English I read in the paper how it's going to be cold today, with unstressed how roughly equivalent to that. English for in sentences like I would prefer for there to be a table in the corner shows a preposition that has arguably developed into a complementizer. (The sequence for there in this sentence is not a prepositional phrase under this analysis.) In many languages of West Africa and South Asia, the form of the complementizer can be related to the verb say. In these languages, the complementizer is also called the quotative. The quotative performs many extended functions in these languages. Empty complementizers Some analyses allow for the possibility of invisible or \\"empty\\" complementizers. An empty complementizer is considered to be present when there is not a word, even though the rules of grammar expect one. The complementizer (for example, \\"that\\") is usually said to be understood ‚Äì i.e., an English speaker knows it is there, and so it does not need to be said. Its existence in English has been proposed based on the following type of alternation: :He hopes you go ahead with the speech :He hopes that you go ahead with the speech Because that can be inserted between the verb and the embedded clause without changing the meaning, the original sentence without a visible complementizer would be reanalyzed as :He hopes √∏C you go ahead with the speech Where the symbol √∏C represents the empty (or \\"null\\") complementizer. This suggests another interpretation of the earlier \\"how\\" sentence: :I read in the paper √∏C [it's going to be cold today] where \\"how\\" serves as a specifier to the empty complementizer. This allows for a consistent analysis of another troublesome alternation: :The man √∏C [I saw yesterday] ate my lunch! :The man √∏C [I saw yesterday] ate my lunch! :The man that [I saw yesterday] ate my lunch! where \\"OP\\" represents an invisible interrogative known as an operator. In a more general sense, the proposed empty complementizer parallels the suggestion of near-universal empty determiners. In various languages =Assyrian Neo-Aramaic= In Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, a modern Aramaic language, kat (or qat, depending on the dialect) is used as a complementizer and is related to the relativizer. Though it is less common in casual speech, and more so in formal conversation. = Hebrew= In Hebrew (both Modern and Ancient) two complementizers coexist:Pages 79‚Äì81 of Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2006), \\"Complement Clause Types in Israeli\\", Complementation: A Cross-Linguistic Typology, edited by R. M. W. Dixon and Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 72‚Äì92 (Chapter 3). ◊©÷∂ , which is either related to the relativizer ‚Äòasher ( < Akkadian ‚Äòashru ‚Äòplace‚Äô) and/or to the pronominal Proto-Semitic dhu ('this'); and ◊õ÷¥÷º◊ô [ki], which is also used as a conjunction meaning 'because, when'.

The theorem allows researchers to understand how the optimal value for a choice variable changes when a feature of the environment changes. The result states that if f is supermodular in (x,Œ∏), and D is a lattice, then x^*(\\\\theta)=\\\\arg\\\\max_{x\\\\in D}f(x,\\\\theta) is nondecreasing in Œ∏. The result is especially helpful for establishing comparative static results when the objective function is not differentiable. An example This example will show how using Topkis's theorem gives the same result as using more standard tools. The advantage of using Topkis's theorem is that it can be applied to a wider class of problems than can be studied with standard economics tools. A driver is driving down a highway and must choose a speed, s. Going faster is desirable, but is more likely to result in a crash. There is some prevalence of potholes, p. The presence of potholes increases the probability of crashing. Note that s is a choice variable and p is a parameter of the environment that is fixed from the perspective of the driver. The driver seeks to \\\\max_{s}U(s,p). We would like to understand how the driver's speed (a choice variable) changes with the amount of potholes: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial s^{\\\\ast }(p)}{\\\\partial p}. If one wanted to solve the problem with standard tools such as the implicit function theorem, one would have to assume that the problem is well behaved: U(.) is twice continuously differentiable, concave in s, that the domain over which s is defined is convex, and that it there is a unique maximizer s^{\\\\ast }(p) for every value of p and that s^{\\\\ast }(p) is in the interior of the set over which s is defined. Note that the optimal speed is a function of the amount of potholes. Taking the first order condition, we know that at the optimum, U_{s}(s^{\\\\ast }(p),p)=0. Differentiating the first order condition, with respect to p and using the implicit function theorem, we find that : U_{ss}(s^{\\\\ast}(p),p)(\\\\partial s^{\\\\ast }(p)/(\\\\partial p))+U_{sp}(s^{\\\\ast }(p),p)=0 or that : \\\\frac{\\\\partial s^{\\\\ast }(p)}{\\\\partial p} = \\\\underset{\\\\text{negative since we assumed }U(.)\\\\text{ was concave in }s}{\\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{-U_{sp}(s^{\\\\ast }(p),p)}{U_{ss}(s^{\\\\ast }(p),p)}}}. So, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial s^{\\\\ast }(p)}{\\\\partial p}\\\\overset{\\\\text{sign}}{=}U_{sp}(s^{\\\\ast }(p),p). If s and p are substitutes, :U_{sp}(s^\\\\ast (p),p)<0 and hence :\\\\frac{\\\\partial s^{\\\\ast }(p)}{\\\\partial p}<0 and more potholes causes less speeding. Clearly it is more reasonable to assume that they are substitutes. The problem with the above approach is that it relies on the differentiability of the objective function and on concavity. We could get at the same answer using Topkis's theorem in the following way. We want to show that U(s,p) is submodular (the opposite of supermodular) in \\\\left( s,p\\\\right) . Note that the choice set is clearly a lattice. The cross partial of U being negative, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 U}{\\\\partial s\\\\,\\\\partial p}<0, is a sufficient condition. Hence if \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 U}{\\\\partial s\\\\,\\\\partial p}<0, we know that \\\\frac{\\\\partial s^{\\\\ast }(p)}{\\\\partial p}<0. Hence using the implicit function theorem and Topkis's theorem gives the same result, but the latter does so with fewer assumptions.

Lyrically the album is themed, referencing \\"aliens, the cyber-age and other extra-terrestrial things,\\" while staying centered on the ultimate truth of renewed life in Christ. Several lyrics draw their themes directly from scripture. Musically it is more diverse than most punk albums, encompassing reggae, aggressive punk, funk, and a \\"slight Gothic overtone\\" similar to Allan's alternate band, Spy Glass Blue. While at least one critic thought the album \\"failed to capture the essence\\" that Sin Disease displayed, most reviews were positive. The album was written over two years and recorded in three weeks. Lyrical themes Lyrically, the album paints a cohesive picture of mankind in a technological society. According to Allan because man is separated from God and so has lost his true identity. In this unnatural state mankind tends toward pagan activities, destroying himself through his vices, in an attempt to find his true identity. This condition is exacerbated by the conditions of the 21st century - a world of information overload where \\"Major Tom is now an info monk.\\" Humans are said to be a \\"Species filled with anti-matter.\\" Perhaps the clearest expression of this idea is in \\"Bobby's Song,\\" which tells the story of a family preparing to leave Earth by way of alien abduction. The story is similar to that of the Heaven's Gate cult; one reviewer describes this as \\"the story of humankind's misplaced yearning for extraordinary salvation from all sources other than the Universal King.\\" The album's answer is that Christ can restore man to his natural state of communion with God. Allan speaks directly to the world in pleading \\"Wake up, sleeper!\\" (echoing Ephesians 5:14, on \\"Lullaby\\") and drawing from Mark 1:17 in \\"Win The Fisher\\" (\\"If you follow me, I'll make you fisher's of men.\\") In Christ Agiurre offers \\"Death! Where is your sting?!\\" (from, \\"Incorruptible\\", 1 Corinthians 15:55) as a triumphant victory cry over the corruption world. Grandmother's space theme has been interpreted in two related ways: that believers are \\"not of this world,\\" and that the world increasingly alienates believers as unwelcome. In this vein \\"As The Story Grows V.2\\" is a continuation of the theme set forth on \\"As The Story Grows\\" (Sin Disease), and \\"Space Junk\\" is most exploratory. These songs restate both questions posed to believers by the outside world (such as \\"How can you believe in a God that would let small children suffer?\\"), and the world's angry reply back to Christians (\\"We love the smell of hell / How dare you try to tell us that / He died to set us free / ...Take your cross and let us be\\".) The album also contains elements of praise and worship music, albeit in a punk fashion, which was, according to Aguirre, \\"a very conscious decision.\\" The best of these are probably \\"Splendor\\" and \\"Arbitrator\\", which draws from Psalm 139, and was remade by Spy Glass Blue on their 2003 release The Blue EP.

Bryan came to Birmingham while he was still studying at Princeton University to serve as part-time pastor of Third Presbyterian Church. After graduating in 1889, he was ordained and installed as the full-time minister on August 4. As a minister, he conducted large evangelistic and prayer gatherings with various groups across the city and region. Bryan's biography Religion in Shoes, by Hunter BlakelyHe was an outspoken supporter of civil rights and racial reconciliation in Birmingham. He is best remembered, however, for his tireless efforts to help the poor and homeless. It is said he would often arrive home at night without his overcoat because he had given it away to a stranger during the day. Though he was an ordained minister and honorary Doctor, he earned the title \\"brother\\" by addressing anyone he met as brother or sister. His life and ministry were recounted by author Hunter Blakely in the 1934 book Religion in Shoes.

The \\"Brother Bryan Mission\\" was founded in 1940 to continue his work with the less fortunate. The City of Birmingham renamed Magnolia Park as \\"Brother Bryan Park\\". Bryan Memorial Presbyterian church in suburban Birmingham is also named in his honor. He was elected in 2002 to the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame. References * Blakely, Hunter B.

It was a sister publication of Electronic Gaming Monthly. The magazine focused exclusively on PlayStation hardware, software, and culture, covering the original PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. Each issue included a disc that contained playable demos and videos of PlayStation games. The magazine was produced for nearly ten years. The first issue, cover dated October 1997, was published September 23, 1997, while the final issue was cover dated January 2007. After OPM was discontinued in January 2007, the independent PlayStation magazine PSM became PlayStation: The Official Magazine in December 2007, replacing OPM as the official magazine focusing on Sony game consoles.

Beginning with issue one, each magazine came with a disc containing playable PlayStation game demos and non-playable video footage. Later, interviews, industry event coverage, and video walkthroughs of games would also be included on the discs. Beginning with issue 49 (October 2001), the magazine came with a PlayStation 2 demo disc, though for a time it would still be alternated with original PlayStation demo discs. Issues 50, 52, and 54 were the last issues to include demo discs for the original PlayStation. All of the demo discs were developed by LifeLike Productions, Inc. OPM had released one PlayStation Portable demo, Killzone Liberation. It was available only with the purchase of retail copies rather than subscription issues. The magazine was discontinued before making the assumed transition to PlayStation 3 demo discs. International editions Similar international editions of the magazine exist in Sweden, Finland, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Brazil and Australia. The Belgian edition is also published in the Netherlands. The Australian edition was originally published by Next Media bi-monthly, but eventually became a monthly magazine.

MOTM stands for \\"Mother Of The Modulars\\".  History  MOTM was created by Paul Schreiber in 1998. The system was created in part due to the renewed interest in large-format analog modular systems that occurred in the late 1990s. Production continues to this day, with over 8000 modules sold. The company, Synthesis Technology, also offers a limited number of modules in Eurorack and Frac format.  Specifications  MOTM systems use a +-15 volt power supply for most modules, with an additional +5 volt power supply required for some digital modules. Audio signals are the standard +/-10 volts, peak to peak.Synthesis Technologies: MOTM Modules The MOTM system modules are all \\"5U\\" (1U being 1.75\\") high, and multiples of 1U wide. All 5U MOTM modules use 1/4\\" jacks for audio/CV signals. Euro and Frac modules use 3.5mm\\" (~1/8\\") jacks. MOTM modules can be mounted in a standard 19\\" rack using MOTM 19A rack rails, although many users have custom cabinets made of metal or wood.  Euro and Frac modules  In early 2006, Synthesis Technology released a limited number of Frac format modules, using 3.5mm jacks and a smaller overall form factor compatible with PAiA Electronics and Blacet modular systems. This was followed by the release of four Eurorack modules (also called 3U, compatible with systems from Doepfer and many other manufacturers). Although full MOTM systems are only available in 5U format, the currently available Frac and Euro modules provide unique functionality that is somewhat different from the 5U MOTM modules. For example, in Frac format, the MOTM-1190 (Dual VCA) and MOTM-1800 (Looping ADSR) are similar but not identical in functionality to their 5U counterparts (the MOTM-190 and MOTM-800 respectively). In Euro format, most of the currently available modules offer functionality that does not currently have an equivalent in MOTM 5U format. The E440 Discrete OTA VCF module is one exception, being very similar to the MOTM-440 (which is based on the SSM 2040 filter from the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5).

The Primary School is Marymount Primary School. History The school, originally known as Holy Spirit School, was founded by the Maryknoll Sisters, an American religious order, on 10 January 1927 in Hong Kong. Back then, the school was on Robinson Road in Central Mid-levels. There were only 8 classes of students sharing four tiny classrooms. In the 1930s, the school moved to a slightly larger building in Caine Road. There were seven classrooms, but conditions were still cramped by today's standards. By 1941, the school was offering a complete course leading to matriculation, and so was one of only a small handful of schools at that time which prepared girls for university. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 35%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" Marymount School Song O Marymount, my Marymount, Thou Beacon of the truth, O glorious the vision bright, That guides the steps of youth! To Thee we pledge our loyalty, O School we love so well, We live to love and follow Thee, O Alma Mater True, We live to love and follow Thee, Our pledge we now renew. O Marymount, blest is thy pow'r, And wonderful Thine aim, High virtue, wisdom, precious flow'r, Thy seal to all proclaim, To Mary our most cherished boast, Our school sweet model fair, We pledge our word to honour Thee, O Alma Mater True, We pledge our word to honour Thee, Our hearts do thou renew. }In 1941, Japanese forces invaded and occupied Hong Kong. The school was closed until 1948. When the school reopened, Hong Kong was facing a new challenge as many thousands of immigrants were pouring across the border to escape the civil war on the mainland. Marymount rose to this challenge by offering places to as many girls as it could. As the school continued to expand, a new building with better facilities became necessary. In October 1957, the school moved to its present location on the wooded slopes near the top of Blue Pool Road, overlooking Happy Valley. At the same time, it was renamed Maryknoll Sisters‚Äô School. Initially, the building housed both Secondary and Primary Sections, but in 1961 the Primary School was relocated to the premises at Tai Hang Road, directly above the secondary school. During the school year 1978‚Äì79, the Maryknoll Sisters handed over the sponsorship of the school to the Columban Sisters. In September 1983, the name of the school was changed to Marymount Secondary School. Throughout its history the school campus had also been home to a convent, with the nun's dormitories housed on the fourth floor and the site of the library originally being a chapel. It was only in 1993 that the nuns vacated their premises in order to make more room for the ever-growing student population. In 1991, Mrs. Nancy Wong became the school's first Chinese principal, and the first principal who was not a member of a religious order. In 1996, the Columban Sisters initiated the transfer of the sponsorship of the school to the Christian Life Community(CLC) in Hong Kong, the process of which was completed by July 1997. The CLC is an international Catholic lay Ignatius community with their spirituality based on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the Founder of the Society of Jesus. Mrs. Wong oversaw the school's transition from being managed by the Columban Sisters to being managed by the CLC and retired in 2003. The post of principal was taken up by Ms. Veronica MA, M.H. till her retirement in 2014, then after Mrs. Julia Ma who left in 2017. Currently, Mrs. Catherine A. Thirlwell LI, alumnae of both Marymount Primary School and Marymount Secondary School, is the principal. Over the years, many generations of girls have received an education at Marymount, and the Primary and Secondary School together now accommodate nearly 2000 students. Curriculum English is the medium of instruction for all subjects except Chinese Language, Chinese Literature, Putonghua and Chinese History. In forms one and two, a Common Test is administered twice a year in place of conventional exams. Grades are given according to continuous assessment throughout the school year instead of just basing on exam results. A modular system is adopted in order to facilitate project-based learning and critical thinking. In senior forms, students prepare for the HKDSE and select subjects from option blocks. In the past MSS offered French in place of Chinese Language for students whose first language is not Chinese, but this option was discontinued in 2012 and replaced by an alternative Chinese curriculum. School Motto The Lord is My Light Annual Production Marymount Secondary School is known in the local speech and drama community for its achievements in theatre. Students perform a drama and/or musical production every year, with recent productions as follows: *1999 - Romeo & Juliet *2000 - King Lear *2001 - Dido & Aeneas *2007 - Orpheus *2008 - Hamlet *2009 - Rodgers & Hammerstein's The King & I *2011 - Othello *2013 - The Taming of the Shrew *2014 - A Servant of Two Masters *2015 - Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella *2016 - The Importance of Being Earnest *2017 - A Midsummer Night's Dream *2018 - Pride and Prejudice *2019 - Little Women Houses There are four houses to which students and teachers are randomly assigned. * Jupiter ‚Äì Red * Mercury ‚Äì Yellow * Uranus ‚Äì Orange * Venus ‚Äì Blue Each house is headed by a House Committee and 2 Teacher Advisors, the House Committee includes a House Captain, two Vice-Captains, a Cheering Leader and 7 form representatives (2 for S.1 and 1 for S. 2‚Äì6) who are elected by students. Every year, students compete in inter-House events, such as the annual Sports Day and Swimming Gala. Scores are counted at the end of the Academic Year, and the house with the highest score is named Overall Champion. Student Council Marymount has an elected Student Council which promotes student welfare and acts as a channel of communication between the school and the student body as well as organising a range of activities throughout the year, including the Talent Quest, Good Samaritan Lunch, Student and Teacher Appreciation Weeks, and the Fun Fair. Students can take part in the Student Council (colloquially known as the \\"SC\\") as elected class representatives in the role of Spokesman or Councillor, or as the Executive Board's Chairlady, Vice-Chairlady, ECA Coordinator, Service Coordinator, Sports Coordinator, Secretary, Treasurer or Public Relations Officer. The Executive Board members are nominated by students, and elected by the students. The Spokesman and the Councillor of each class are elected by its own class members. Talent Quest The Student Council's largest-scale project each year is the Talent Quest, colloquially known as \\"TQ\\". The event takes the form of a multi-stage talent show divided into different categories: * Chinese Solo (Singing) * Chinese Group (Singing) * English Solo (Singing) * English Group (Singing) * Dance * Foreign * Open * Class * Fashion Subsequent to heats and semi-final rounds held throughout the first term of the school year, finalists perform for the title of Champion in each category, as well as Overall Champion. The adjudicating panel is normally made up of three industry professionals in the fields of music, dance, and fashion design respectively. Tickets are on sale to the public and the audience is generally made up of members of the general public as well as the MSS community. The Talent Quest is highly valued by the student body as the performing arts, particularly music, are integral to Marymount culture. Many competitors have gone on to have professional careers in music and dance. The Student Council organises the event around a distinct theme each year. The themes of recent Talent Quests are: *Agent 1314 (2013) *Tetrachromacy (2014) *Atlantis (2015) *Deja Vu (2016) *Trouvaille (2017) *Nefelibata (2018) *Arcadia (2019)  Religious Activity Convenor  As a Catholic school, Marymount has also an elected committee in which members are responsible for all religious activities in the school. Catholic students can participate in Religious Activity Convenor (colloquially known RAC) as an elected representative known as Class RAC in each class, or in the Executive Board's Chairlady, two Vice Chairladies, Secretary, Treasurer and Public Relations Officer. Every year, the RAC organises Catholic functions and masses such as monthly Friday Morning Mass, Annual Christmas Play, Easter Mass, Chinese Year Mass, Graduation Mass for the S6 graduates, Good Samaritan Lunch (cooperating with Student Council), Catholic Family Mass (cooperating with Marymount Primary School) etc. The class RAC of each class are elected by its own class members during RE lesson in early September. Class RAC also operates the daily morning prayer of each class. The RAC also monitors different religious groups in the school to spread God's faith and the catholic society. Religious Groups *Legion of Mary (The Praesidium was named Mother Most Admirable Praesidium, and was founded in 1959. It is under Curia Mater Dei, the English junior Curia in St. Margaret's Parish, along with other Catholic secondary schools in Wan Chai District) *MSS CLC (S4-6 only) * Voveo * GIFTS (Growing In Faith Through Sharing) *Shalom  Graduation Mass  Being a Catholic institution, the school marks most significant occasions with a Mass. In March of each year, a Graduation Mass celebrates S. 6 students completing their education at MSS before they prepare for public exams is heralded by a Graduation Mass. The event gathers the school community and is characterised by the treasured tradition of the school supervisor, principal, and vice principals in lighting a white candle for each graduating girl in a darkened auditorium, symbolising pass it on. Students then protect the flame until the end of the school day and their final departure from school grounds. Since 1999, the Primary and Secondary Schools have celebrated the Catholic Family Mass in May. Parents and grandparents of students, teachers, students, alumnae, school managers and members of the CLC of Hong Kong gather together to give thanks for the graces and love of God. Marymount Schools are not just institutions where students are educated. Young women grow to become part of the Marymount Community and Marymount Family.

It was written by Donna Franceschild, produced by Chris Parr and directed by David Blair. It is set in a fictional hospital called St Jude's Asylum, filmed in Gartloch Hospital (formerly asylum) which closed after filming in 1996. The station is developed by alcoholic double glazing salesman Eddie McKenna (Ken Stott), who is an aspiring disc jockey at St. Jude's Hospital, named after the patron saint of lost causes. He meets a range of people with various mental illnesses: *Campbell (David Tennant) ‚Äì a young, enthusiastic contributor to the station, who is a manic depressive (bi-polar). *Francine (Katy Murphy) ‚Äì a long-term depressive patient who self harms and to whom McKenna is strongly attracted. *Fergus (Angus Macfadyen) ‚Äì an electrical engineer, who has schizophrenia and a habit of escaping from the hospital then returning. *Rosalie (Ruth McCabe) ‚Äì a middle-aged housewife who has OCD regarding cleanliness and is separating from her husband. The show uses many Beatles songs both in its soundtrack and episode titles. The name of the hospital, for example, is echoed by the Beatles' \\"Hey Jude\\". The show is also notable for its sound editing with popular music tracks seamlessly blended between soundtrack theme and live foreground action. The series BBC DVD was released on 9 June 2008 and the show was re-run on BBC Four, beginning August 2008 with two episodes shown back-to-back over three consecutive Saturday evenings. Due to music copyright issues, Junior Campbell who wrote the incidental music, was also commissioned to record cover versions of most of the original hits included in the series soundtrack. These were dubbed on the original worldwide television transmissions (excluding UK) and also on the series BBC DVD. Episodes Each of the episodes is named after a popular song. # \\"Hey Jude\\" (27 September 1994) # \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\" (4 October 1994) # \\"You Always Hurt the One You Love\\" (11 October 1994) # \\"Fool on the Hill\\" (18 October 1994) # \\"Rainy Night in Georgia\\" (25 October 1994) # \\"Let it Be\\" (1 November 1994) Awards The show won the 1995 BAFTA award for Best Serial and Best Editing, RTS Award for Best Writer, Mental Health in the Media Award and the Scottish BAFTA for Best Serial and for Best Writer. Adaptation Franceschild has adapted the BBC show for the stage. It is directed by Mark Thomson and co- produced by the Citizens Theatre and Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh in 2013.

It functions without the threat of liquidation for the foreseeable future, which is usually regarded as at least the next 12 months or the specified accounting period (the longer of the both). The presumption of going concern for the business implies the basic declaration of intention to keep operating its activities at least for the next year, which is a basic assumption for preparing financial statements that comprehend the conceptual framework of the IFRS. Hence, a declaration of going concern means that the business has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or to materially curtail the scale of its operations. Continuation of an entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for financial reporting unless and until the entity's liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity's liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements are prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting (Financial Accounting Standards Board, 2014Financial Accounting Standards Board, 2014). Definition The going concern assumption is universally understood and accepted by accounting professionals; however, it has never been formally incorporated into U.S GAAP. In October 2008, FASB issued an Exposure Draft called \\"Going Concern.\\" It discusses the following possible pronouncements for the going concern: * Reconsideration of defining and incorporating the terms going concern and substantial doubt into U.S. GAAP * The time horizon over which management would evaluate the entity's ability to meet its obligations * The type of information that management should consider in evaluating the entity's ability to meet its obligations * The effect of subsequent events on management's evaluation of the entity's ability to meet its obligations * Whether to provide guidance on the liquidation basis of accounting . A current definition of the going concern assumption can be found in the AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No.1 Codification of Auditing Standards and Procedures, Section 341, ‚Äú The Auditor‚Äôs Consideration of an Entity‚Äôs Ability to Continue as a Going Concern‚Äù(AU Section 341). The 'going concern' concept assumes that the business will remain in existence long enough for all the assets of the business to be fully utilized. Utilized assets means obtaining the complete benefit from their earning potential. (i.e. if you recently purchased equipment costing $5,000 that had 5 years of productive/useful life, then under the going concern assumption, the accountant would only write off one year's value $1,000 (1/5th) this year, leaving $4,000 to be treated as a fixed asset with future economic value for the business). Accounting The going concern principle allows the company to defer some of its prepaid expenses until future accounting periods. The going concern assumption is a fundamental assumption in the preparation of financial statements. Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, unless the going concern assumption is inappropriate in the circumstances of the entity, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets, discharge its liabilities, and obtain refinancing (if necessary) in the normal course of business. An entity is assumed to be a going concern in the absence of significant information to the contrary. An example of such contrary information is an entity's inability to meet its obligations as they come due without substantial asset sales or debt restructurings. If such were not the case, an entity would essentially be acquiring assets with the intention of closing its operations and reselling the assets to another party. If the accountant believes that an entity may no longer be a going concern, then this brings up the issue of whether its assets are impaired, which may call for the write- down of their carrying amount to their liquidation value, and/or the recognition of liabilities that arise on account of the entity's imminent closure (which may not arise otherwise). Thus, the value of an entity that is assumed to be a going concern is higher than its breakup value, since a going concern can potentially continue to earn profits. The going concern concept is not clearly defined anywhere in generally accepted accounting principles, and so is subject to a considerable amount of interpretation regarding when an entity should report it. However, generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) do instruct an auditor regarding the consideration of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The auditor evaluates an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a period not less than one year following the date of the financial statements being audited (a longer period may be considered if the auditor believes such extended period to be relevant). The auditor considers such items as negative trends in operating results, loan defaults, denial of trade credit from suppliers uneconomical long-term commitments, and legal proceedings in deciding if there is a substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. If so, the auditor must draw attention to the uncertainty regarding the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, in their auditor's report. On the other hand, inappropriate use of the going concern assumption by an entity may cause the auditor to issue an adverse opinion on the financial statements. This Guidance provides a framework to assist directors, audit committees and finance teams in determining whether it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis for preparing financial statements and in making balanced, proportionate and clear disclosures. Separate standards and guidance have been issued by the Auditing Practices Board to address the work of auditors in relation to going concern. =Assumption= Under the going concern assumption, an entity is viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future. General purpose financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Special purpose financial statements may or may not be prepared in accordance with a financial reporting framework for which the going concern basis is relevant (for example, the going concern basis is not relevant for some financial statements prepared on a tax basis in particular jurisdictions). When the use of the going concern assumption is appropriate, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Auditing Continuation of an entity as a going concern is assumed in financial reporting in the absence of significant information to the contrary. Ordinarily, information that significantly contradicts the going concern assumption relates to the entity's inability to continue to meet its obligations as they become due without substantial disposition of assets outside the ordinary course of business, restructuring of debt, externally forced revisions of its operations, or similar actions. =Responsibilities= The auditor has a responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year beyond the date of the financial statements being audited (hereinafter referred to as a reasonable period of time). The auditor's evaluation is based on his or her knowledge of relevant conditions and events that exist at or have occurred prior to the date of the auditor's report. Information about such conditions or events is obtained from the application of auditing procedures planned and performed to achieve audit objectives that are related to management's assertions embodied in the financial statements being audited, as described in Auditing Standard No. 15, Audit Evidence. The auditor should evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time in the following manner: The auditor considers whether the results of his procedures performed in planning, gathering evidential matter relative to the various audit objectives, and completing the audit identify conditions and events that, when considered in the aggregate, indicate there could be substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. It may be necessary to obtain additional information about such conditions and events, as well as the appropriate evidential matter to support information that mitigates the auditor's doubt. If the auditor believes there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, he should obtain information about management's plans that are intended to mitigate the effect of such conditions or events, and assess the likelihood that such plans can be effectively implemented. After the auditor has evaluated management's plans, he concludes whether he has substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. If the auditor concludes there is substantial doubt, he should consider the adequacy of disclosure about the entity's possible inability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, and include an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) in his audit report to reflect his conclusion. If the auditor concludes that substantial doubt does not exist, he should consider the need for disclosure. The auditor is not responsible for predicting future conditions or events. The fact that the entity may cease to exist as a going concern subsequent to receiving a report from the auditor that does not refer to substantial doubt, even within one year following the date of the financial statements, does not, in itself, indicate inadequate performance by the auditor. Accordingly, the absence of reference to substantial doubt in an auditor's report should not be viewed as providing assurance as to an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. =Procedures= It is not necessary to design audit procedures solely to identify conditions and events that, when considered in the aggregate, indicate there could be substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The results of auditing procedures designed and performed to achieve other audit objectives should be sufficient for that purpose. The following are examples of procedures that may identify such conditions and events: *Analytical procedures *Review of subsequent events *Review of compliance with the terms of debt and loan agreements *Reading of minutes of meetings of stockholders, board of directors, and important committees of the board *Inquiry of an entity's legal counsel about litigation, claims, and assessments *Confirmation with related and third parties of the details of arrangements to provide or maintain financial support =Conditions and events= In performing audit procedures such as those presented in paragraph .05, the auditor may identify information about certain conditions or events that, when considered in the aggregate, indicate there could be substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The significance of such conditions and events will depend on the circumstances, and some may have significance only when viewed in conjunction with others. The following are examples of such conditions and events: Negative trends‚Äîfor example, recurring operating losses, working capital deficiencies, negative cash flows from operating activities, adverse key financial ratios Other indications of possible financial difficulties‚Äîfor example, default on loan or similar agreements, arrearages in dividends, denial of usual trade credit from suppliers, restructuring of debt, noncompliance with statutory capital requirements, need to seek new sources or methods of financing or to dispose of substantial assets Internal matters‚Äîfor example, work stoppages or other labor difficulties, substantial dependence on the success of a particular project, uneconomic long-term commitments, need to significantly revise operations External matters that have occurred‚Äîfor example, legal proceedings, legislation, or similar matters that might jeopardize an entity's ability to operate; loss of a key franchise, license, or patent; loss of a principal customer or supplier; uninsured or underinsured catastrophe such as a drought, earthquake, or flood. =Management's plans= If, after considering the identified conditions and events in the aggregate, the auditor believes there is substantial doubt about the ability of the entity to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, he should consider management's plans for dealing with the adverse effects of the conditions and events. The auditor should obtain information about the plans and consider whether it is likely the adverse effects will be mitigated for a reasonable period of time and that such plans can be effectively implemented. The auditor's considerations relating to management plans may include the following: Plans to dispose of assets *Restrictions on disposal of assets, such as covenants limiting such transactions in loan or similar agreements or encumbrances against assets *Apparent marketability of assets that management plans to sell *Possible direct or indirect effects of disposal of assets Plans to borrow money or restructure debt *Availability of debt financing, including existing or committed credit arrangements, such as lines of credit or arrangements for factoring receivables or sale-leaseback of assets *Existing or committed arrangements to restructure or subordinate debt or to guarantee loans to the entity *Possible effects on management's borrowing plans of existing restrictions on additional borrowing or the sufficiency of available collateral Plans to reduce or delay expenditures *Apparent feasibility of plans to reduce overhead or administrative expenditures, to postpone maintenance or research and development projects, or to lease rather than purchase assets *Possible direct or indirect effects of reduced or delayed expenditures Plans to increase ownership equity *Apparent feasibility of plans to increase ownership equity, including existing or committed arrangements to raise additional capital *Existing or committed arrangements to reduce current dividend requirements or to accelerate cash distributions from affiliates or other investors When evaluating management's plans, the auditor should identify those elements that are particularly significant to overcoming the adverse effects of the conditions and events and should plan and perform auditing procedures to obtain evidential matter about them. For example, the auditor should consider the adequacy of support regarding the ability to obtain additional financing or the planned disposal of assets. When prospective financial information is particularly significant to management's plans, the auditor should request management to provide that information and should consider the adequacy of support for significant assumptions underlying that information. The auditor should give particular attention to assumptions that are‚Äî *Material to the prospective financial information. *Especially sensitive or susceptible to change. *Inconsistent with historical trends. The auditor's consideration should be based on knowledge of the entity, its business, and its management and should include (a) reading of the prospective financial information and the underlying assumptions and (b) comparing prospective financial information in prior periods with actual results and comparing prospective information for the current period with results achieved to date. If the auditor becomes aware of factors, the effects of which are not reflected in such prospective financial information, he should discuss those factors with management and, if necessary, request revision of the prospective financial information. =Financial statement effects= When, after considering management's plans, the auditor concludes there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, the auditor should consider the possible effects on the financial statements and the adequacy of the related disclosure. Some of the information that might be disclosed includes‚Äî *Pertinent conditions and events giving rise to the assessment of substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. *The possible effects of such conditions and events. *Management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions and events and any mitigating factors. *Possible discontinuance of operations. *Management's plans (including relevant prospective financial information). fn 3 *Information about the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities. When, primarily because of the auditor's consideration of management's plans, he concludes that substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time is alleviated, he should consider the need for disclosure of the principal conditions and events that initially caused him to believe there was substantial doubt. The auditor's consideration of disclosure should include the possible effects of such conditions and events, and any mitigating factors, including management's plans. =Effects on the auditor's report= If, after considering identified conditions and events and management's plans, the auditor concludes that substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time remains, the audit report should include an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) to reflect that conclusion. fn 4 (?) The auditor's conclusion about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern should be expressed through the use of the phrase \\"substantial doubt about its (the entity's) ability to continue as a going concern\\" [or similar wording that includes the terms substantial doubt and going concern] as illustrated in paragraph .13. [As amended, effective for reports issued after December 31, 1990, by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 64.] An example follows of an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) in the auditor's report describing an uncertainty about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note X. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. [As amended, effective for reports issued after December 31, 1990, by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 64.] If the auditor concludes that the entity's disclosures with respect to the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time are inadequate, a departure from generally accepted accounting principles exists. This may result in either a qualified (except for) or an adverse opinion. Reporting guidance for such situations is provided in section 508, Reports on Audited Financial Statements. Substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time that arose in the current period does not imply that a basis for such doubt existed in the prior period and, therefore, should not affect the auditor's report on the financial statements of the prior period that are presented on a comparative basis. When financial statements of one or more prior periods are presented on a comparative basis with financial statements of the current period, reporting guidance is provided in section 508. If substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time existed at the date of prior period financial statements that are presented on a comparative basis, and that doubt has been removed in the current period, the explanatory paragraph included in the auditor's report (following the opinion paragraph) on the financial statements of the prior period should not be repeated. =Exceptions= Because the issuance of a going-concern opinion is feared to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, auditors may be reluctant to issue one. A going-concern opinion may lower stockholders‚Äô and creditors‚Äô confidence in the company; ratings agencies may then downgrade the debt, leading to an inability to obtain new capital and an increase in the cost of existing capital. In 1978, the AICPA formed an independent commission (the Cohen Commission) that issued a report expressing this sentiment: Creditors often regard a subject to qualification as a separate reason for not granting a loan, a reason in addition to the circumstances creating the uncertainty that caused the qualification. This frequently puts the auditor in the position, in effect, of deciding whether a company is able to obtain the funds it needs to continue operating. Thus, the auditor's qualification tends to be a self- fulfilling prophecy. The auditor's expression of uncertainty about the company's ability to continue may contribute to making it a certainty. The fear is that a going-concern opinion can hasten the demise of an already troubled company, reduce a loan officer's willingness to grant a line of credit to that troubled company, or increase the point spread that would be charged if that company were granted a loan. Auditors are placed at the center of a moral and ethical dilemma: whether to issue a going-concern opinion and risk escalating the financial distress of their client, or not issue a going- concern opinion and risk not informing interested parties of the possible failure of the company. The hope is that issuing a going-concern opinion might promote timelier rescue activity. Another, more troubling reason that auditors might fail to issue a going-concern opinion has been alluded to by the mainstream media in the WorldCom and Enron business failures: lack of auditor independence. Management determines the auditor's tenure and remuneration. The threat of receiving a going-concern modification may send management to another auditor, in a phenomenon referred to as ‚Äúopinion shopping.‚Äù Moreover, in an extreme case of a self-fulfilling prophecy, if the client does go bankrupt, the auditor loses future audit fees. This fear of losing future fees could compromise the auditor's ability to render an unbiased opinion on a client's financial statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 made it much more difficult for a plaintiff to bring suit successfully against a company's auditors. While the act did codify as law the reporting requirements of SAS 59, it also made it more difficult for a plaintiff's attorneys to successfully pursue class-action litigation against auditors. Furthermore, in cases where auditors did fail to modify their audit opinions in accordance with SAS 59, the damage awards were limited to proportionate liability. When comparing the potential costs of issuing a going-concern opinion (hastening the demise of the client; losing audit fees) to the costs of not issuing a going-concern opinion (litigation), the result of the act was essentially to tip the scales in favor of not issuing a going-concern opinion. Since the act was passed, high-profile litigation citing the auditors‚Äô failure to issue a going-concern opinion, such as the class-action lawsuits by Kmart's shareholders against PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Adelphia's against Deloitte & Touche, has been drastically reduced. The most critical reason that auditors might fail to issue a going-concern opinion, however, could be a fundamental misunderstanding of the assumption itself. Use in risk management If a public or private company reports that its auditors have doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern, investors may take that as a sign of increased risk, although an emphasis of matter paragraph in an audit report does not necessarily indicate that a company is on the verge of insolvency. Despite this, some fund managers may be required to sell the stock to maintain an appropriate level of risk in their portfolios. A negative judgment may also result in the breach of bank loan covenants or lead a debt rating firm to lower the rating on the company's debt, making the cost of existing debt increase and/or preventing the company from obtaining additional debt financing. Because of such responses to expressed concerns by auditors, in the 1970s, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Cohen commission concluded that an auditor's expression of uncertainty about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern \\"tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The auditor's expression of uncertainty about the company's ability to continue may contribute to making its failure a certainty.\\" Businesses should also communicate with business advisors as well as their auditors in the time of trouble. Communication can let advisors and auditors help when needed. They can help business review their internal risk management along with other internal controls.

Cathy & Marcy currently live in Silver Spring, Maryland and Lansing, North Carolina. History Cathy Fink was born in Maryland, but began her musical career in Canada in the early 1970s, busking and playing folk music in coffeehouses. A singer, guitarist, banjo player and yodeler, she made her recording debut in 1975 with Duck Donald, with whom she toured for five years and recorded three albums. Marcy Marxer grew up in Swartz Creek, Michigan and learned to play guitar, mandolin, hammered dulcimer and button accordion while still in high school. She went to work for General Motors but continued to play at every opportunity. In 1978, after receiving theater training at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Ringling Brothers Clown College, she devoted herself to music full-time. The two met in 1980, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, at the Mariposa Folk Festival. By 1983 they had begun writing songs together and appearing on each other's albums.

Clear Channel Outdoor Americas (CCOA) is an out-of-home (OOH) advertising company based in New York City with operations throughout the U.S. and the Caribbean. CCOA is one of two separate business units operating as part of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCOH). The other business unit, Clear Channel International (CCI), includes, Europe, Singapore and Latin America. Globally, both CCOA and CCI employ 5,800 people. Following a separation from its former parent company, iHeartMedia, Inc., in May 2019, CCOH, Inc., has operated as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: CCO). In the U.S., Clear Channel Outdoor Americas offers outdoor advertising in 43 of the top 50 markets and maintains an office and operations presence employing over 1,500 people. Across its roadside and street level market footprint, CCOA offers tens of thousands of printed billboards in a variety of formats. History = Founding and Predecessor Companies = Clear Channel Outdoor Americas (CCOA) was one of the first outdoor advertising companies in the United States and is one of the largest. It has origins in three major predecessor companies: Foster & Kleiser (F&K;) (1901‚Äì1986), Patrick Media Outdoor (1986‚Äì1995), and Eller Media Company (1959‚Äì1997). F&K; changed its name to Patrick Media Group after Metromedia sold the company to Patrick Media Group and a major investor group led by General Electric, and it was acquired in turn by Karl Eller in 1995. Alongside this outdoor advertising consolidation, the Mays family in San Antonio, Texas, founded a broadcasting company in 1972, which would become known as Clear Channel Communications. By the mid-90s, Clear Channel Communications owned 43 radio and 16 television stations. By 2004, Clear Channel owned more than 1,200 radio stations and 36 television stations in the United States and 770,000 billboards globally. Along the way, CCO further consolidated operations by acquiring Universal Outdoor (Naegele, Derse, POA, Revere), Donrey, Paxton Outdoor, Ackerley Media, Badger Outdoor, ABC Outdoor, and Hansen Outdoor, to name a few of the larger transactions. = Expansion and iHeartMedia = In November 2005, Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CCO) and its parent company, Clear Channel Communications, Inc. (NYSE:CCU) announced the initial public offering of 35,000,000 shares of Class A common stock of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings at a price of $18.00 per share, for a total offering of $630,000,000. In 2006, CCOH acquired Interspace Airport Advertising and began operating as Clear Channel Interspace Airports. In 2009, the airports media sales business began operating as Clear Channel Airports. Today, Clear Channel Airports manages advertising and marketing contracts in more than 260 airports across the world. In 2007, Clear Channel Outdoor began its partnership with the FBI to display fugitives and missing persons on billboards across the United States. In 2008, Clear Channel was taken private by firms Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital LLC, and the Mays family divested their interests in the company. In September 2014, CCO's then-parent parent company changed its name from Clear Channel Communications, Inc. to iHeartMedia. The outdoor advertising entity retained the Clear Channel name to protect that trademark. In 2015, Scott Wells became CEO of Clear Channel Outdoor Americas. He is responsible for all CCOA‚Äôs business in the U.S., and its Caribbean-based airport media sales operations. In 2016, CCOA proved the effectiveness of the Out-of-Home (OOH) medium and announced the industry‚Äôs first measurable outdoor advertising solution known as CCO RADAR. CCO executed this using aggregated and anonymized mobile location data from privacy compliant data providers. On January 7, 2016, Lamar Advertising Company purchased Clear Channel Outdoor's assets in 5 major U.S. city markets for $458.5 million. In 2016, CCOA introduced the automated ability (programmatic) for advertisers to buy ads on its various digital outdoor formats using computer programs. = Spin-off out of iHeartMedia = On December 21, 2018, iHeartMedia announced its intent to spin out its majority stake in Clear Channel Outdoor, as part of a proposed reorganization plan to reduce debt and exit its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The reorganization plan was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas in January 2019, and was completed in May 2019. This made Clear Channel an independent company, and Clear Channel International (CCI) CEO William Eccleshare became the new worldwide CEO. He remains in London in addition to his responsibilities as the worldwide CEO, he continues to lead CCI.

It ranges predominantly in Mexico (including the Yucat√°n Peninsula), but is also found in Central America. They are terrestrial, burrowing spiders. The reason for the name red rump is because of its distinctive red hairs on its abdomen. Like most tarantulas, they will eat anything they can overpower, which is usually insects, but small lizards and rodents may also be consumed. They can grow up to a solid 6.5 inch leg span, with males typically being smaller and thinner than the females. They prefer shrubland habitats. In 1996, Tliltocatl vagans was discovered in the wild in St. Lucie County, Florida. It is now considered an established non-native species in that state, where it is thought to have been introduced through either accidental or intentional releases of specimens imported via the pet trade, although their numbers have been dwindling due to many T. vagans eating insects poisoned by pesticides. Distribution of confirmed specimens of Tliltocatl species ‚ñà Tliltocatl vagans Taxonomy The genus Brachypelma was split up, with this species moving to become Tliltocatl vagans. The move is accepted by the World Spider Catalog.  In captivity  T. vagans is frequently kept and bred in captivity. They are typically docile, though they can be skittish and prone to releasing urticating hairs. Females are long-lived, potentially reaching 15 years of age. Due to its popularity in the pet trade, T. vagans is listed under appendix II of CITES (under its former name) to prevent illegal removal and international trade. This trade, combined with habitat destruction and a high rate of mortality prior to sexual maturity, means that T. vagans is considered vulnerable to extinction.  In traditional Mayan medicine  The Ch'ol Maya consider these spiders to be positive, and use them medicinally. A hierbatero kills it, then crushes it, mixes it with spirit alcohol and strains out any irritating hairs with a traditional cloth. The beverage is used for the treatment of \\"tarantula wind\\", the symptoms being chest pain, coughing and asthma. The venom peptide GsMtx-4 is being investigated for the possible treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, muscular dystrophy and glioma.

Leakey was so impressed with White's work that he recommended him to his mother, Mary Leakey, to help her with hominid fossils she had found at Laetoli, Tanzania. White took a job at the University of California, Berkeley in 1977 and collaborated with J. Desmond Clark and F. Clark Howell. In 1994, White discovered 4.4 million-year-old Ardipithecus ramidus, a likely human ancestor from an era which was previously empty of fossil evidence. Near the Awash River in Ethiopia, he found an almost complete fossilized female skeleton, named \\"Ardi\\". He took nearly 15 years to prepare publication of the description. In 1996, White, along with paleontologist Berhane Asfaw discovered fossils of a 2.5 million-year-old species BOU-VP-12/130 Australopithecus garhi, which is thought to predate H. habilis tool use and manufacturing by 100,000 to 600,000 years.

Owned by Stingray Group and airing a country music format, the station is currently branded as 930 KIXX Country. History The station was launched in 1950 as CJON and was owned by the Newfoundland Broadcasting Company (Geoff Stirling and Don Jamieson), which launched CJON-TV in 1955. The company later launched additional AM stations throughout the province. In 1978, Jamieson transferred his interest in Newfoundland Broadcasting to Stirling in exchange for the AM stations. As part of the deal, the stations changed call signs, in CJON's case to CJYQ. All the new call signs ended in \\"Q\\", so the group became known as the Q Radio Network. In 1983, Jamieson sold the stations to CHUM Limited. During CHUM's ownership, the Q Radio stations became oldies stations, while a new co-owned country music FM station, CKIX-FM, was launched. In 1990, the stations were sold again to Newcap Broadcasting, which quickly converted the AM stations outside St. John's to country music (fed from CKIX). Two of the stations were closed soon after, while the others eventually converted to FM. CJYQ, or Classic Hits Q93 as it was known under Newcap, continued to be an apparently viable station until the late 1990s, when the station was quietly switched to full-time automation, dropping all but a bare minimum of announcers (shared with CKIX and later VOCM) to read weather forecasts and other brief segments. In 2000, when Newcap proposed to purchase the VOCM group, the longtime rival of CJYQ, it proposed to keep the latter station, which it would not have normally been entitled to do in a market the size of St. John's (where the maximum number of stations per ownership group is three). In exchange the station would air a greater amount of Canadian content than required (40% instead of 35%), of which at least half (or 20% overall) would have to be Newfoundland music. The CRTC permitted this, and at noon on September 8, 2000, the station became Radio Newfoundland. This may have caused some minor confusion as VOCM had occasionally used that name for group branding in prior years. Since the changeover, CJYQ has in fact even exceeded its higher requirements, with almost 80% Newfoundland content. However, it continues to be a largely automated station with few regular on-air staff, although the station does air some long-form magazine programs on the weekend. As Radio Newfoundland, the station occasionally played station IDs recorded by Newfoundland musicians that opted to call the station Radio Newfoundland and Labrador, as a result of the province's official name change in 2001. However, this was not a reflection of the station's actual brand at the time; in fact, the station's signal does not reach Labrador, and little if any of the station's programming or music originated there. (Newcap did have a separate operation branded as Radio Labrador (now known as Big Land FM) however, this station is part of the main VOCM network, and airs a mix of adult contemporary music outside of network programming.) The station adopted its This is Newfoundland and Labrador branding in April 2010 to coincide with the launch of a new Newcap- owned tourism portal of the same name. On January 28, 2014, a fire destroyed CJYQ's broadcasting tower, knocking the station of off the air. It transmitted over the Internet until repairs were completed in February. On April 14, 2015, the country music format that had previously aired on VOCM moved to CJYQ, which coincidentally rebranded as 930 KIXX Country. Sports CJYQ previously carried St. John's Maple Leafs games over the air, the last two seasons of the St. John's Fog Devils, and carried St. John's IceCaps games over the air from October 2011 to April 2017.

He returned to Ireland to play with the Shamrock Rovers, making his debut, along with Jackie Mooney against Shelbourne at Dalymount Park on 22 August 1962. He played in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup that season and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup the following season against Valencia giving him a total of 4 European appearances. During this season Pat played in all 22 league games where Rovers only lost once winning every trophy except the Top Four Cup. He left Milltown to join Manchester United in May 1964 for a fee of ¬£10,500, winning a league title medal in his first season. Dunne made his debut for the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier against Spain at Dalymount Park in May 1965. He played in the first ever Republic of Ireland U23 game in 1966 In February 1967 he joined Plymouth Argyle, costing the Devon side ¬£5,000. Dunne was Argyle's player of the season in 1967‚Äì68. Pat was a guest player on Rovers' American tour in the summer of 1967 where he was voted goalkeeper of the tournament. He rejoined Rovers in November 1970. He became the first player to be shown a red card in League of Ireland football when he was sent off on 1 September 1974 in a League Cup match against Shelbourne. During this time he even started taking penalties for the club scoring one against Cork Hibs on 10 December 1972. Pat Dunne travelled to Japan in September 1975 with the Rovers team that played three matches on that tour and they beat the Japanese international side 3‚Äì2 in one of them. He vied with Alan O'Neill for the goalkeeping spot over the next two seasons but when Johnny Giles arrived in the summer of 1977 it wasn't long before Pat was on his way from Rovers. Pat played in Giles' first match in charge in August 1977 but he left during the season and became player-manager of Thurles Town. Later was player-manager at Shelbourne, finally retiring from playing in 1981 after a career stretching some 20 years.

Up until the 1960s, a province that did not participate in a shared-cost program would suffer a financial penalty for exercising this choice. The province of Quebec exercised this choice on occasion despite the financial cost. In the 1960s, negotiations between the federal and the Quebec governments led to tax abatements or fiscal compensation formulas which compensated the Quebec government when it opted out of federal programs. Under the Constitution Act, 1982, the right for any province to opt out of future constitutional amendments that would transfer legislative powers from the provincial legislatures to Parliament is affirmed. Financial compensation is guaranteed for any province that opts out of such an amendment relating to education or other cultural matters. Under the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords, this financial compensation was to be extended to include any constitutional amendment that transferred any legislative powers, not just those relating to education or other cultural matters. However, neither the Meech Lake nor the Charlottetown Accords were ratified.

The spines are the relatively large, radiating organs; the glochids are the fine prickles in the centres of the bunches. Glochids (Opuntia microdasys monstrose) Glochids or glochidia (singular \\"glochidium\\") are hair-like spines or short prickles, generally barbed, found on the areoles of cacti in the sub-family Opuntioideae. Cactus glochids easily detached from the plant and lodge in the skin, causing irritation upon contact. The tufts of glochids in the areoles nearly cover the stem surfaces of some cactus species, each tuft containing hundreds of glochids; this may be in addition to, or instead of, the larger, more conspicuous cactus spines, which do not readily detach and are not generally barbed.  Mechanical irritant dermatitis  =Reaction to the glochidia= Most cacti possess spines, some large enough to cause serious wounds. Glochids however, though smaller, commonly induce more troublesome, more persistent, dermatological manifestations in humans. Though minute, glochids commonly are barbed and once they have penetrated the skin barbed glochids are practically impossible to dislodge without leaving scraps of foreign material in the wound. Implantation of glochidia in the skin does sometimes cause immediate irritation, but not always, as one may deduce from the presentation of patients with granulomatous lesions around glochidia, patients who have no recollection of the penetration that caused the acute injury, even when it is clear that the injury is far from fresh. Distraction or excitement might cause the victim to overlook brushing past a cactus and picking up a few hundred barely visible glochids. In such cases, the irritant reaction may have a delayed onset. Shanon reported that brushing his axillary skin with sabra fruit resulted in no symptoms for a half-hour, followed by hours of \\"stabbing feelings\\". Winer reports immediate burning sensation, redness and swelling which remained for one to three days if the spines were removed. Depending on the exposure, widespread areas may be involved, even extending to hard palate, tongue, conjunctiva and cornea. If the glochidia are not removed, a response may ensue that eventuates in granulomatous dermatitis. Within 24 to 72 hours there is the appearance of 2- to 5-mm, asymptomatic, domed, glistening papules, sometimes erythematous, with a central pin-point-sized black dot at the site of the injury. There may be groups of these papules. Vesicles and pustules and even focal ulceration may also occur. In some instances, diagnosis can be made easily by passing the fingers over the affected area and by feeling the embedded glochidia. Left untreated, these lesions may last as long as 9 months. A biopsy of the later lesions reveals granuloma formation with plant material embedded in the dermis. The fragments of the barbed bristles gave strongly positive reactions with PAS. The presence of a cactus granuloma lesion is often followed by post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Penetrating injuries can introduce pathogenic microorganisms into the wound. Examples include Clostridium tetani and Staphylococcus aureus (from spines and thorns), Sporothrix schenckii (from rose thorns, grasses, and sphagnum moss), Mycobacterium kansasii (from blackberries), Mycobacterium marinum (from cactus spines), and Mycobacterium ulcerans (from spiky tropical vegetation). Glochids from prickly pears (Opuntia species) can cause an extremely pruritic, papular eruption called sabra dermatitis, which can easily be confused with scabies or fiberglass dermatitis. =Sabra dermatitis= Sabra Dermatitis The skin reaction of gatherers of the fruit was described in Israel and is known as \\"sabra dermatitis\\". This condition is characterized by a papular or vesicular reaction that is sometimes scabies-like. It has also been described as tinea- likePlant Contact Dermatitis, Claude Benezra., George Ducombs, Yves Sell, Jean Foussereau. B.C. Decker Inc Toronto. 1985 and dyshidrosis-like. The hard palate and tongue are occasionally affected.Opuntia in BoDD - Botanical Dermatology Database Typical areas of involvement of this irritant dermatitis include fingers, wrists, genitals, thorax, and buttocks. Biopsy of these lesions will reveal that they contain glochidia. Glochidia may be transferred to the workers' clothing and thence to other individuals. It is recommended that the fruit should be picked only when wetted, and picking should be stopped when it is windy since the glochidia can become airborne.  Removal of glochidia  foxtail. If the glochidia are allowed to remain in the skin, a dermatitis may ensue that will persist for months. It may help to treat the affected area with a topical corticosteroid. However, since the presence of glochidia is the inciting factor, removal of these minute spines is generally preferable. Glochidia may be difficult to remove. Yanking out the bristles may result in leaving one or more 20‚Äì30 micrometre sized barbs in the skin, later to be manifest by granuloma formation. Attempts to suck out the glochidia are likely to result in their attachment to the tongue. Popular methods of removing glochidia have included spreading adhesive plaster over the area and ripping it off quickly or using melted wax (as is used in wax hair removal. Martinez et al. studied various methods of removing glochidia from rabbit skin. They evaluated tweezers, glue, facial mask, adhesive tape, package- sealing tape, and tweezing followed by glue. The most effective single method was tweezing, which removed 76% of the spines. The method using a thin layer of household glue covered with gauze, allowed to dry (about 30 minutes) and then peeled off resulted in removal of 63% of the spines. Facial masks and adhesive tapes removed about 40% and 30% of the spines, respectively, and produced more retention and inflammation three days after removal than no treatment. Repeated applications of adhesive tape did not improve the results. According to Martinez, the most effective method is to first use tweezers to remove clumps of spines followed by the application and removal of household glue, resulting in removal of 95% of the spines. Unroofing the early vesicles or pustules may permit manual extraction of the spicules. Soaking unroofed papules may allow for extrusion of the glochidia. Faster resolution may be obtained by removing the papules. A method of treatment has been described for the granulomatous papules, and involves unroofing the granulomatous papules, removing the glochidia fragments under a dissecting microscope, and subsequently soaking the wound in an antibacterial solution.

Early life and career Ray graduated from Hillsborough High School in Tampa, Florida, and attended The College of William and Mary, where he started on their baseball team. In 2002, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected by the Orioles in the third round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. Professional career =Minor leagues= He spent the and seasons in the Orioles minor league system before being called up in June of . =Baltimore Orioles= 2005 In 2005, Ray allowed only two earned runs in just under 20 innings. However, during the month of August, Ray was optioned to the Orioles' Double-A affiliate, the Bowie Baysox. His stint at Bowie was brief, as he was called up again in late August. The second stint with the Orioles saw Ray allow 4 earned runs in 16 innings. Ray finished 2005 with a 2.66 ERA in 40 innings pitched over 41 games, compiling a record of 1-3 with 8 holds. Ray also compiled a 1.28 WHIP. The Orioles coaching staff had been so impressed by Ray's 2005 season that they were considering him their closer of the future. But, since the Orioles have had little success with rushing prospects into big league roles, they planned to ease Ray into the closer role sometime in . However, closer B.J. Ryan left the Orioles as a free agent to the Toronto Blue Jays, and the Orioles were unable to sign a closer on the free agent market to serve as a short term solution, causing Ray to be the Orioles' de facto closer. 2006 Ray became the full-time closer of Baltimore Orioles for the start of the season. Ray had a very successful first season as the closer for the O's. Ray compiled 33 saves with a 2.73 ERA and 51 strikeouts and allowed an opponent batting average of just .193. Given his success, the Orioles stuck with Ray as their closer for the 2007 regular season. However, his success would not carry over, resulting in a sub par year. During the 2007 season Ray's numbers dropped to 16 saves with a 4.43 ERA and 44 strikeouts. 2007-09 Ray underwent Tommy John surgery on August 17, 2007. In August 2008 he made nine rehabilitation appearances in the minor leagues, but did not pitch for the Orioles during the season. In 2009, he made the opening day roster but posted an era of 7.27. =Texas Rangers= Ray was traded to the Texas Rangers on December 9, 2009 for Kevin Millwood. He had 35 appearances and an ERA of 3.40. =San Francisco Giants= Ray was traded to the San Francisco Giants, along with pitching prospect Michael Main, for Bengie Molina on June 30, 2010. On December 2, 2010, the Giants non-tendered Ray, making him a free agent. =Seattle Mariners= Ray signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners on January 25, 2011. The deal included an invite to spring training. On August 1, 2011, Ray was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right shoulder latissimus dorsi. He was released on August 16. =Cleveland Indians= Ray attended spring training in 2012 with the Cleveland Indians as a non-roster invitee. Reassigned to minor-league camp on , Ray began the season pitching in the Triple-A Columbus Clippers opening game on . Ray was released by the Indians on July 7. =Oakland Athletics= On July 13, Ray signed with the Oakland Athletics and was assigned to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. He was released on July 26. In the 2012-2013 offseason, he retired. Personal life Chris and his wife Alice have two children, Virginia and Thomas. Chris stated in a March 2013 interview he was now retired from baseball. In November 2012 Chris, his brother Phil Ray, and their families opened a craft brewery in Ashland, Virginia, Center Of The Universe (COTU) Brewing. Ray is an avid homebrewer and released a collaborative charity beer with Fremont Brewing Company in July 2011, benefiting Operation Homefront.

The general function of labels are widely known and recognized as a method of distinction that helps people recognize one product from another. In social terms, labels represent a way of differentiating and identifying people that is considered by many as a form of prejudice and discrimination. The most common method of 'labeling' people derives from a general way of perceiving members of a certain nationality, religion, ethnicity, gender, or some other group. When a majority of people hold a certain point of view towards a certain group, that point of view becomes a stereotype. That stereotype affects the way other people perceive the groups in question and the result is a 'label' that is metaphorically imposed on the members of the group in question. A member of a targeted group is thus 'labeled' by the larger society, and along with it, the nuances underlying the label, be it positive or negative, that aids in the formation of social stereotypes.

Its transmitter is located in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia (Trenton is part of the Philadelphia television market); it was previously the only independent television station to exclusively serve the residents of central New Jersey. WPHY-CD is owned by WRNN-TV Associates, which also owns WTVE in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania and fellow independent WMCN-TV in Princeton, New Jersey in the Philadelphia television market. History The station first broadcast in 1993 on analog channel 25, and was originally assigned the call sign W25AW, though for much of its history it branded as \\"WZBN TV-25.\\" The station's tower was located in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey. The station's call sign became W50DZ-D in January 2012 after converting to digital broadcasting on channel 50; however, through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel 25. The station has received several awards from the Community Broadcasters Association for local service and programming. With the creation of a statewide and regional cable news service owned by the cable companies, cable outlets threatened to pull WZBN off their systems in the late 1990s. Protests by viewers ensured the station remained on cable. WZBN has since expanded its reach with additional broadcasts on three competing cable systems (Verizon Fios, Cablevision, Comcast) in the area. In 2012, the station's longtime owners, the Zanoni family, announced that they would sell W50DZ-D to NRJ TV LLC (a company unrelated to European broadcaster NRJ Radio), which already owned WTVE. The station's local programming was discontinued on June 8, 2012; the sale was completed a week later, on June 15, 2012. On November 1, 2012, NRJ TV changed W50DZ-D's call sign to WPHY-CD. The WPHY call sign was previously used by two radio stations audible in the market; it was on 560 AM in Philadelphia for ten months in 1993-94, ending when that signal's heritage call sign WFIL became available and was reclaimed, and it was on 920 AM in Trenton from 2002 to 2008.

Mascot controversy Union's use of the \\"Redskins\\" team name has exposed it to some criticism, similar to the controversy faced by other schools using mascots referring to Native Americans. In 1999, Cherokee Nation chief Chad Smith criticized the school's use of the name.S.E. Ruckman, \\"What's in a name? Dispute\\", Tulsa World, November 14, 1999. In December 2002, the school received a demand from the University of Miami that it stop using a \\"split-U\\" logo which Miami claimed was unacceptably similar to the university's trademarked logo. Some Native American groups saw this as an appropriate time to renew their calls for Union to abandon the Redskins name, since it appeared that the school would have to change its uniforms in any event. However, in January 2003, Union settled Miami's claim by agreeing to pay $9,599 per year for the continuing right to use the split-U logo.Union Public Schools In November 2003 the school board voted unanimously to keep the \\"Redskins\\" name.Jay Cooper, \\"Union votes to keep 'Redskins' mascot\\", Tulsa World, November 11, 2003.

He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 2006. Nicknamed the \\"Big Cat\\" for his nimble feet, Wright played on five NFC Championship teams that advanced to the Super Bowl (1970, 1971, 1975, 1977, and 1978 seasons), winning twice. He also participated in the Ice Bowl against the Green Bay Packers for the NFL championship in his rookie season in 1967. Early years Born and raised in Griffin, Georgia, Wright attended Fairmont High School, which was merged with Griffin High School. He was a letterman in basketball, but he was unable to make the high school football team. Wright went to nearby Fort Valley State College to play college basketball, where he was a standout player. The following summer, head coach Stan Lomax made him quit his summer job at a mill to get ready to join the Wildcats' football team. Lomax tried Wright at free safety, then used him as a punter, defensive end and tight end. The coach also became a father figure to Wright. Professional career Wright was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round of the 1967 NFL/AFL draft, 182nd overall, as a tight end. During his first three years with Dallas, the , \\"Big Cat\\" was a tight end, defensive lineman, and offensive tackle. In his third season in 1969, Wright got his first chance as a starter after Ralph Neely was sidelined by injury. His opponent in his first start was Los Angeles Rams future Hall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones, who was in his prime. Wright's performance was so strong that he won a starting role as right tackle before the first day of training camp in 1970. For thirteen seasons, Wright played more than 200 games, started at right tackle in six NFC Championship games, and played in five Super Bowls, winning two of them: (VI, XII). He earned his first of four All-Pro honors in 1971 and was voted that same year to the first of six straight Pro Bowls. Wright was named first- or second-team All-Pro each season from 1971 through 1976, earned three All-NFC honors, and the Cowboys led the league for total offense five times (ranked 6th all-time at retirement in 1979). His blocking and leadership as the team's co-captain for seven years helped the Cowboys win 10 division titles and six conference crowns. Released by the Cowboys in March 1980, Wright signed in April with division rival Philadelphia, but retired early in training camp in July 1980. He anchored the line for an offense that finished in the top ten in scoring all ten seasons of the 1970s, while helping pave the way for the first five 1,000-yard rushers in Cowboys' history. Wright played at a time when the right tackle was the most important spot on the offensive line, and was usually paired against the opponent's best pass rusher. He broke every time- honored mold previously held for men of his size. He was light on his feet and possessed an athleticism that had him miscast as a tight end and defensive end for the first three years of his NFL career. \\"Rayfield could do it all,\\" said former Cowboys running back Calvin Hill after Wright's election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. \\"He could pull. He could run in the open field. He could finesse-block and power-block in the run game. And there was no one better in pass-blocking. He was dominant.\\" \\"He was absolutely the best,\\" said Roger Staubach. \\"Rayfield was a big, strong guy that was able to transfer his size and strength from tight end to tackle. He also had such quick feet that he was able to deal with some of the faster defensive ends and even the linebacker blitzes. If he got beat, I don't remember it.\\" Was voted the NFLPA NFC Offensive Lineman of the Year in . Wright was also presented with a number of individual awards following the conclusion of his career, including the NFL All-Super Bowl Team (1990), the Dallas Cowboys 25th Anniversary Team (1985), the Cowboys' own Ring of Honor (2004), the Texas Sports Hall of Fame (2005) and was named to the NFL‚Äôs All-Decade Team of the 1970s. Legacy Wright was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. He was a member of the NFL All-Time Super Bowl Team in 1990 and received the NFL Legends Award that same year. He was inducted into the Texas Black Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2004, Rayfield Wright was inducted in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. In 2006, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was officially inducted, with introduction by college coach Leon J. \\"Stan\\" Lomax, during the Enshrinement Ceremony on August 6, 2006 where his bust, sculpted by Scott Myers, was unveiled. He was also inducted into the State of Georgia Hall of Fame, the Fort Valley Georgia Hall of Fame and the Griffin Georgia Hall of Fame. Personal life In 1992, Wright served as an assistant coach to the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League. Wright's post-football involvement with at-risk, inner city youth resulted in his appointment to the Juvenile Supreme Court in Arizona. He also served as president of the NFL Alumni Chapter, \\"Caring for Kids\\" program in the mid-90s. He philanthropic endeavors, including the non-profit \\"Kids 4 Tomorrow\\" organization he co-founded with some other NFL players, were featured in Volume 9 of the Philanthropy World Magazine, along with former Cowboy teammate, Cliff Harris. Wright founded the Rayfield Wright Foundation, which helps children obtain grants to attend college. He authored and published his autobiography Wright Up Front. In recent years, Wright has battled with early- onset dementia, the result of numerous head injuries he says he had in 13 seasons, more than 180 regular-season and playoff games from 1967 to 1979.

Keller...there's plenty to alk about!\\" The Morning Call (Allentown, Pennsylvania)14 Aug 1965, SatPage 12 (accessible on newspapers.com) Keller is a graduate of Bucknell University (BA, 1972), Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary (M.Div., 1975) and Westminster Theological Seminary, where he received his D.Min. in 1981, under the supervision of Harvie M. Conn. He became a Christian while at Bucknell University, due to the ministry of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, with which he later served as a staff member. He was ordained by the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) and served as a pastor at West Hopewell Presbyterian Church in Hopewell, Virginia for nine years,\\"Tim Keller,\\" Bigthink.com. while serving as director of church planting for the PCA. He also served on the faculty of Westminster Theological Seminary, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he and his wife Kathy Keller were involved in urban ministry. Keller was recruited by his denomination to start Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan in 1989 despite his relative lack of experience and after two others had turned down the position. Today the church's attendance is over 2,000 each week. In 2008, Keller published his first book in 20 years (since his report to his denomination on diaconal ministries titled \\"Ministries of Mercy\\" in 1989). The book, entitled The Reason for God, was based on common objections to the Christian faith heard during his ministry in New York City. The book reached No. 7 on the New York Times Nonfiction bestseller list. Personal life Keller currently resides on Roosevelt Island in New York City with his wife, Kathy. They have three sons, David, Michael and Jonathan. In June 2020, Keller revealed that he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Ministry Keller frequently draws on secular or academic sources like The New York Times, and media coverage has treated him as an anomaly: a pastor who appeals to Manhattan yuppies and intellectuals. =Redeemer Presbyterian Church= Redeemer Presbyterian Church grew from 50 people to a total attendance of over 5,000 people each Sunday as of 2008, leading some to call him \\"the most successful Christian Evangelist in the city.\\" In 2004 Christianity Today praised Redeemer as \\"one of Manhattan's most vital congregations\\". The church's emphasis on young urban professionals, whom Keller believes exhibit disproportionate influence over the culture and its ideas, has given the church an unusual makeup for a US megachurch. The majority of the congregation is made up of single adults; it is also over forty percent Asian-American, and has many congregants working in the arts and financial services. In his preaching, \\"he hardly shrinks from difficult Christian truths, [but] he sounds different from many of the shrill evangelical voices in the public sphere.\\" Keller often critiques both political parties and avoids taking public stances on political issues, resulting in a politically centrist church. Redeemer Presbyterian Church has also founded Hope for New York, a non-profit organization that sends volunteers and grants to over 40 faith-based ministries serving social needs in New York City, the Center for Faith and Work to train professionals in Christian theology, and Redeemer City to City to train and fund pastors in New York and other cities. Keller is a co-founder of The Gospel Coalition, a group of Reformed leaders from around the United States. His mentoring of younger church leaders, such as Scott Sauls in Nashville and Steve Chong in Sydney, has increased his influence globally. On July 1, 2017, Keller stepped down from his role as senior pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church. The move was part of a larger vision to shift his efforts from preaching to training the next generation of church leaders and starting new churches in global cities through Redeemer City to City.http://byfaithonline.com/keller-shifts-from- preaching-to-teaching/ Theology Keller shuns the label \\"evangelical\\" because of its political and fundamentalist connotation, preferring to call himself orthodox because \\"he believes in the importance of personal conversion or being 'born again,' and the full authority of the Bible.\\" He identifies with Reformed Theology, although he has been critiqued by some in that tradition for his modern interpretation of its doctrines.Iain D. Campbell and William M. Schweitzer (eds.), Engaging with Keller (Evangelical Press, 2013). He has been described as a \\"doctrine-friendly emerging pastor\\" and a \\"neo- Calvinist.\\" =The Gospel versus religion= The centerpiece and underpinning of Keller's ministry has been his teaching of the doctrine of the gospel, emphasizing the doctrines of total depravity, unmerited grace and substitutionary atonement. This teaching is summarized in his oft-used explanation, \\"The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope.‚Äù This understanding of the gospel is contrasted to what Keller calls ‚Äútraditional religion‚Äù (which he defines as a set of rules, rituals or actions that enable an individual to earn salvation or favor with God) as well as ‚Äúirreligion‚Äù (which he defines as the belief that there is no God or no need for his favor). This has been referred to as a ‚Äúgospel third way,‚Äù or ‚Äúgospel-centered‚Äù approach. Typical of this teaching is his interpretation of the Parable of the Prodigal Son (see The Prodigal God), based on a teaching of one of Keller's mentors, Edmund Clowney. =Apologetics= Keller's preaching and writing in his apologetics is characterized by a respectful orientation towards an educated and skeptical audience outside the faith. His most explicit work on the subject is The Reason for God which he attributes to thousands of conversations with skeptical New Yorkers over the course of his ministry (Reason, xix). Elsewhere he has written about the loss of a Christian culture in the West, including in the academic and cultural establishments, and the need for Christians to contextualize to the current secular and anti-religious cultural climate. On creationism, Keller states his view is not strictly literal and that evolution is \\"neither ruled in nor ruled out\\" in his church. Keller has written on the topic for the Biologos Foundation. Keller's major influences in apologetics include C.S. Lewis, Cornelius Van Til, John Stott, Alvin Plantinga and Miroslav Volf. =Idolatry= Another central theme in Keller's teaching is idolatry, based on teachings of Martin LutherA Treatise on Good Works and John Calvin,Institutes of the Christian Religion, Battles Edition, Book 1, Chapter XI, Section 8 and on the Ten Commandments and other parts of the Bible. Keller states that contemporary idol worship continues today in the form of an addiction or devotion to money, career, sex, power and anything people seek to give significance and satisfaction in life other than God (detailed in his book Counterfeit Gods). =Social justice and politics= Keller disavows the \\"Social Gospel\\" that has characterized Mainline Protestant churches, which advocates liberal political causes and de-emphasizes the doctrines of sin and substitutionary sacrifice. However he has also criticized the evangelical alliance with Republicans and argued that Christianity is a much broader global movement that agrees with some liberal and some conservative issues (and critiques them both). He has argued for giving to charitable causes and caring for the needs of the poor based on biblical texts such as the Torah and the Parable of the Good Samaritan. =Cultural engagement= Attributed partly to his congregation of upwardly mobile Manhattanites, Keller has been a leader in applying Christian theology to secular vocations such as business, art and entrepreneurship. The Center for Faith and Work at Redeemer has sponsored business competitions and theological education for working professionals. His views on Christianity and culture are outlined in his books Every Good Endeavor and Center Church. Keller is an avid fan of the work of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, both well-known Christian authors, and also supports the Harry Potter novels which have been considered pagan by certain conservative Christians.Michael Paulson, \\"Some Christians love Frodo but put a hex on Harry Potter,\\" Boston Globe, January 2, 2002. =Sex and gender= Keller has a complementarian view of gender that believes that the Bible teaches defined roles for both genders, but the specific duties accompanying each gender's role is undefined. He believes that \\"Marriage provides the personal growth that comes through cross-gender relationships.\\" He elaborates on the biblical view of sex and marriage in his book The Meaning of Marriage and believes homosexuality is inconsistent with scripture. Keller is a signatory of the Manhattan Declaration and is opposed to abortion, but is not opposed to contraception. =Cities and urban church planting= While at Westminster Theological Seminary, Keller was mentored by Harvie Conn, an early advocate of ministry in urban centers, and was recruited to start Redeemer Presbyterian Church due to a shortage of biblically orthodox churches in center-city Manhattan. He has since become a worldwide spokesman for the need to create new kinds of churches in urban centers to address rapid urbanization. He delivered a plenary address on the subject at the Lausanne Conference of 2010. Through Redeemer City to City, Keller mentors and chairs a network of center- city churches that represents similar ministry values worldwide.Miller, Lisa (2008-02-09). \\"The Smart Shepherd\\". Newsweek. He writes extensively on the importance of cities and gives a biblical theological framework for ministry in cities in his book on ministry, Center Church.

(Producto Alimenticio Nacional) is the first brand of boiled maize flour in Venezuela. The brand itself became a synecdoche, as even with other large competitors in the market, it is used as a noun to indicate any similar maize flour. This flour is similar to the main ingredient of the Italian polenta. Usage Harina PAN is used to make the maize flour dough also known as \\"masa de arepa\\" or \\"masarepa\\", which is used to make Venezuelan dishes such as arepas, hallacas, empanadas, and bollos pelones. Also used to prepare several Colombian dishes as well. Harina PAN is found in varieties made from white and yellow corn. It contains no additives and is considered suitable for those with restricted diets. Empresas Polar has had a notoriously bad marketing culture for this product. The instructions to prepare the dough on their package is very vague to the point that they don't even bother to spell what the absorption ratio of the flour is. History The traditional preparation of arepa flour is very labor-intensive, requiring the pounding of maize in a large mortar. The precooked arepa flour was invented in the 1950s by Dr. Luis Caballero Mejias, a Venezuelan engineer who used the profits from his patent to finance a Technical Schools system. In 1954, the Venezuelan beer and malted drinks company Empresas Polar developed an industrial production method, launching the brand in 1960. Its spokesmen said that had been the idea of Czech master brewer Carlos Roubicek, one of the first employees of the Polar Brewery, and Juan Lorenzo Mendoza Quintero, son of the founder Lorenzo Mendoza Fleury, taking advantage of the Remavenca machinery and the corn flakes manufactured in that plant to improve the beer flavor. In fact, Empresas Polar does not accredit Luis Caballero Mej√≠as, for the development of the process that served for the production of maize flour. The brand name Harina P.A.N. was proposed by Empresas Polar's then President and Chairman of the Board Carlos Eduardo Stolk. He selected the acronym \\"P.A.N.,\\" in Spanish \\"Producto Alimenticio Nacional,\\" or in English, \\"National Food Product,\\" to represent a food product for mass consumption for all Venezuelans.\\" The product rapidly gained acceptance among housewives because of the tremendous saving in labor and its high quality. The original slogan was \\"Se acab√≥ la piladera\\", which means \\"No more pounding\\". Harina PAN has remained essentially unchanged since then, as can be seen from the original advertisements. The precooked flour was later mass-produced and sold in larger quantities. Cultural influence For decades, Harina PAN has been an essential ingredient for Venezuelans, and more recently in Colombian cooking, with websites dedicated to locating the nearest distributor in several countries in the world. Pre-made arepa flour is specially prepared for making arepas and other maize dough-based dishes, such as Venezuelan hallacas, bollos, and empanadas. The most popular brand names of corn flour are Harina PAN in Venezuela, and Areparina in Colombia. Pre-made arepa flour is usually made from white corn, but there are yellow corn varieties available. To Venezuelans, it forms a part of their national identity, making up a large portion of their diet.

It is mainly used to provide estimates of the hydraulic conductivity of the soil near saturation. History Conventional techniques for measuring in-situ infiltration include the use of a single or double ring infiltrometer. Single and double ring infiltrometer only measures flow under ponded (saturated) conditions, and when used in soil with distinct macropores, preferential flow will dominate the flow. (See: Poiseuille's law) This does not reflect infiltration under rainfall or sprinkler irrigation. Therefore, many authors attempted to create a negative potential (tension) on the water flow. This is to exclude macropores in the flow process, hence only measuring the soil matrix flow. Willard Gardner and Walter Gardner developed a negative head permeameter as early as 1939. Dixon (1975) developed a closed-top ring infiltrometer to quantify macropores. Water is applied to a closed-top system, which permits the imposition of negative head or pressure on the ponded water surface. Negative tension can be considered as simulating a positive soil air pressure, created by a negative air pressure above ponded surface water. A simplification was made by Topp and Zebchuk (1985). The limitation of this device is the infiltration has to be started by ponding the closed-top infiltrometer (applying a positive head), then adjusted to a negative pressure. Little research effort was continued in this area, instead attention has been given mainly to the sorptivity apparatus of Dirksen (1975) which used a ceramic plate as a base. Based on this design, Brent Clothier and Ian White (1981) developed the sorptivity tube which can provide a constant negative potential (tension) on the soil surface. However, the sorptivity tube had many shortcomings, hence modifications to the design led to the development of the disc permeameter by Perroux and White (1988) from CSIRO. In the US it is known as the tension infiltrometer. For more on the development of the first permeameter as told by Walter Gardner, visit (http://www.decagon.com/ag_research/hydro/history.php) The Disc The CSIRO disc permeameter of Perroux and White (1988) (not patented) comprises a nylon mesh supply membrane (with a very small diameter around 10‚Äì40 mm), a water reservoir and a bubbling tower. The bubbling tower is connected to the reservoir and is open to air. The bubbling tower controls the potential h0 applied to the membrane by adjusting the water height in the air-inlet tube. So essentially the soil pores need to have energy equivalent to h0 to overcome water that is held under tension in the reservoir. It can be used to supply potential ranging -200 mm to 0 mm, effectively excluding pores with diameter bigger than 0.075 mm. Many different designs have evolved, including: * automated recording tension infiltrometer (Ankeny, Kaspar & Horton, 1988), patented by the Iowa State University (Soil Moisture Measurement https://web.archive.org/web/20060127085537/http://www.soilmeasurement.com/tension_infil.html) * mini-disc infiltrometer (Decagon Devices, http://www.decagon.com/products/lysimeters-and-infiltrometers/mini-disk- tension-infiltrometer) * hood infiltrometer (Umwelt-Ger√§te-Technik, http://www.ugt-online.de) Mathematical analysis The CSIRO ponded disc permeameter Due to the three-dimensional water flow from the disc, a special formulation is needed to take into account the lateral absorption of water. The analyses are derived from the simple, steady-state analysis of Wooding (1968). For steady infiltration from a circular, shallow, inundated area, Wooding found that a remarkable feature of this curve is the fact that it never departs far from the straight line: : Q* = 2 \\\\pi a + 4 where Q* is the dimensionless flux, a = \\\\alpha r/2. r is the radius of the disc [cm] and \\\\alpha [1/cm] is the sorptive number or the parameter of Gardner's (1958) hydraulic conductivity function: : K(h) = K_s \\\\mathrm{e}^{\\\\alpha h} where K is the hydraulic conductivity [cm/h], Ks is saturated conductivity and h is soil water potential [cm]. In terms of the actual steady-state infiltration rate q¬• [cm/h]: :q_\\\\infty = \\\\alpha \\\\phi_0 + \\\\frac{4 \\\\phi_0}{\\\\pi_r} References *Clothier, B.E., White, I., 1981.

History The station was launched on July 26, 1946 by Sarnia Broadcasting. In 1947, Sarnia Broadcasting Co. was granted a licence to operate an FM station at 97.5 MHz (as CHOK-FM), which left the air sometime between 1948 and 1953 after being damaged from the Sarnia tornado. That station was never rebuilt.CHOK 97.5 MHz (1948-1953) - Canadian Communications Foundation It was acquired by IWC Communications, a corporate precursor of Standard Broadcasting, in 1970, and went through a variety of sales to local owners until being acquired by its current owner, Blackburn Radio, in 1998. Blackburn also owns both of the city's other commercial radio stations, CFGX-FM and CHKS-FM. =CHOK-1-FM= In April 2007, CHOK AM applied to add an FM transmitter (CHOK-1-FM) at Sarnia to broadcast at 103.3 MHz and simulcast the programming of CHOK 1070 AM, due to AM reception problems from metal and steel associated with the operations from petrochemical plants.CRTC Notice of Public hearing #13 April 10, 2007 Another company, Points Eagle Radio, had applied at the same time to use the 103.3 MHz frequency to broadcast Aboriginal programing.

The 101.5 FM frequency is reserved for use by the CBC, should they choose to broadcast on that frequency in the future. Format On January 12, 2007 at 6AM, CHOK changed its format from news/talk and oldies, with the brand name Information Radio, to a country music format aimed at WSAQ's Canadian audience. On May 21, 2013, CHOK dropped its country format and changed its music to a gold-based adult contemporary music, with some country and classic hits mixed in. The service elements of the previous format remain in place, with hourly news reports and local talk programs. The music leans older and softer than the hot mainstream AC format of sister station CFGX-FM. Toronto Blue Jays games, which had been off the air since 2006, returned to the station, as did the Sarnia Sting. The format change came as WHLS in Port Huron updated its format from oldies to a classic hits mix. WHLS would later flip to alternative rock in 2015 as Rock 105.5, leaving CHOK the only remaining station in the market that still plays pre-1980s hits, as WGRT, WBTI and sister CFGX-FM have more modern AC formats. On December 26, 2019, CHOK dropped its gold-based adult contemporary format and changed its music back to country.

The bridge carries of State Highway 146 (SH 146), between the cities of Baytown and La Porte (east of Houston). The bridge is also expected to carry State Highway 99 (SH 99) (Grand Parkway) when it is completed around Houston. The bridge, named for Fred Hartman (1908‚Äì1991), the editor and publisher of the Baytown Sun from 1950 to 1974, is the longest cable-stayed bridge in Texas, and one of only four such bridges in the state, the others being Veterans Memorial Bridge in Orange County, Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge in Dallas and Bluff Dale Suspension Bridge in Erath County. It is the 77th largest bridge in the world. The construction cost of the bridge was $91.25 million. The bridge replaced the Baytown Tunnel (of depth clearance ). The tunnel had to be removed when the Houston Ship Channel was deepened to , with a minimum bottom width, to accommodate larger ships. The last section of the Baytown Tunnel was removed from the Houston Ship Channel on September 14, 1999, with removal of the tunnel being the responsibility of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Construction In October 1985 the Texas Highway department announced the project and estimated it would take two years to complete. The bridge was designed by Greiner Engineering, Inc., which was acquired by URS Corporation in 1995, which in turn was acquired by AECOM in October 2014. Construction began in 1987 and was contracted by Williams Brothers and Traylor Brothers construction companies. In 1993, The firm selected to produce the steel, a Mexican company, went bankrupt. The contract was then awarded to a South African company which caused complaints because of the country's apartheid policies. After the completion date was pushed back several times, a letter was sent to the Texas Department of Transportation's executive director, William Burnett from the city of Baytown via the Baytown Sun in early 1995 which helped spur interest in finishing the project. Finally, on September 27, 1995 the Fred Hartman Bridge had its grand opening ceremony, which was hosted by Baytown Chamber of Commerce and La Porte Chamber of Commerce. Notable guests include George W. Bush, Miss Texas 1995, William Burnett and the Hartman family. Fred Hartman died in 1991 and did not live to see his dream come to fruition. The possibility of placing tolls on the bridge became an issue in a runoff election for the Texas House of Representatives in 2016 between the Republican winner, attorney Briscoe Cain of Deer Park, and the defeated seven-term Representative Wayne Smith of Baytown. Cain claimed that an online petition opposing tolling of the structure was a \\"preventative measure\\" because, \\"Smith's work history and legislative record on transportation gives Texans plenty to be concerned about.\\" Bob Leiper, a former city manager in Baytown, leaped to Smith's defense in a \\"Letter to the Editor\\" of the Baytown Sun: I was astounded by Briscoe Cain's claim that Rep. Wayne Smith is somehow trying to make the Hartman Bridge a toll bridge. As an attorney you would think he would seek the truth before making such a wild claim and blaming it on one of the best friends and advocate Baytown ever had in Austin.

His journal provides a firsthand account of what the German 6th Army was experiencing and how they were coping with the situation, without the outside interpretive influence of propaganda and censorship. Although it is limited in information because it only gives the account of one person, it is still one of the few unaltered German accounts to survive World War II. Journal Content As the battle begins in August 1942, Wilhelm and his comrades are in high spirits. His commander believes if they complete their objectives quickly, they will be home for Christmas. Wilhelm also has faith that ‚Äúthe F√ºhrer will carry this thing through to a successful end.‚Äù As the battle begins, he is shocked to see how hard the Russian soldiers are fighting to defend the city. A captured Soviet officer informs his commander that the Russians will defend Stalingrad to the last round. He initially refers to the resistance as barbaric and fanatical, but as the battle continues the Russians begin to begrudgingly earn his respect, at one point saying ‚ÄúThe Russians are not men, but some kind of cast-iron creatures.‚Äù One of the most notable accounts from the journal is the brutal six-day-long battle between 16 and 22 September 1942 over a grain elevator where, according to him, only 40 Russian soldiers (he refers to them as \\"devils\\") were found dead in the elevator at the end of the engagement, while his battalion in comparison, suffered disastrously heavy losses. By 28th of September his regiment reaches the Volga and they celebrate, believing the battle to be almost over. His regiment however is sent to capture the factories along the river, and this results in very high casualties. Morale breaks down, as the men now believe that they are doomed, and many hope to get wounded and sent away from the front. By late November the Soviets launch a major counterattack, and the 6th Army is encircled. As rations get lower, the Germans begin to starve. Erich von Manstein‚Äôs forces attempt to break the encirclement, bringing hope to the besieged soldiers, but he is defeated. Hoffman‚Äôs final journal entry is on 26 December, with the final phrase ‚ÄúA curse on this war!‚Äù While the exact fate of Hoffman is unknown, it is believed that he perished not long after in the bitter fighting.

It is said that the drink was invented when Cox ran out of gin while entertaining American guests. Wary about serving local rum straight up, Cox added lime juice and sugar to improve the rum‚Äôs taste. Consumption of the drink remained localized until 1909, when Admiral Lucius W. Johnson, a US Navy medical officer, tried Cox‚Äôs drink. Johnson subsequently introduced it to the Army and Navy Club in Washington, DC, and to ports of call around the world. Through to the navy's supply of vitamins by adding citrus to their rum in hope to defeat scurvy, he amongst other had acquired an taste for citrus. So the success of the newly born Daiquiri at the Army and Navy was enormous The credit given to Cox remains disputed, with some sources stating that he was assisted by a Cuban engineer named Pagliuchi, or that the drink had already been a Cuban specialty. Cox lived in Santiago de Cuba. The writer and journalist Richard Harding Davis wrote his novel Soldiers of Fortune (1897) while a guest at Cox's house (O‚ÄôToole, 79).

It is north of Harrogate, north west of Knaresborough and is just north of the River Nidd where it flows through Nidd Gorge. However; all the watercourses through the village and the parish flow eastwards via the River Tutt and empty into the River Ure despite Scotton being very close to the Nidd. The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book as Scotone and was listed as belonging to Gilbert Tison with only two households. Scotton was the home of Guy Fawkes during his teenage years, Scotton has a Guy Fawkes Night celebration in his honour. The village has an annual summer fete called the Scotton Feast. Not held in 2005 for the first time in several years (the organising committee claimed that it was because of a lack of support from the village), it returned in 2006. One of the old houses near the present day church was the setting of a local folktale that the Gunpowder plot was concocted there; however, Speight determines that there is no evidence that Fawkes visited the village after 1603, which makes this tale extremely unlikely. Apart from the Guy Fawkes Arms public house, the village has little in the way of public amenities. It has a village hall, a cricket team and a boys and girls junior football teams, but no shop, as the post office closed down rather than become a national lottery outlet. There is a Methodist church and Anglican one (the Church of St Thomas the Apostle). St Thomas' church was consecrated in May 1889; previous to this, worship used to be held in a house in the village. Scotton Cricket Club play in the Nidderdale Cricket League with the 1st XI in the 2nd division, and the 2nd XI in the 8th division of the same league. Scotton is sometimes used as a shortcut by people wishing to travel from the A6055 to the B6165 and vice versa.

The Corton vineyards on this side of the hill are located in Aloxe-Corton. Corton-Charlemagne is an Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for white wine in C√¥te de Beaune subregion of Burgundy. It is located in the communes of Aloxe-Corton, Pernand-Vergelesses and Ladoix-Serrigny with Chardonnay being the only permitted grape variety. Around 300,000 bottles of white wine are produced each year in the appellation. Corton-Charlemagne is named after the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne, who once owned the hill of Corton on which the vineyards now rest. The first mention of a Clos de Charlemagne dates to 1375, in a lease of the 'Clos le Charlemagne' by the Chapitre de Saint-Androche-de- Saulieu. According to later legend, the vineyards are dedicated to white grape varieties because the emperor's wife preferred white wines as they did not stain his beard. The AOC was created in 1937. The vines are located on the higher ground of a hilltop that stretches between the Burgundian villages of Ladoix-Serrigny and Pernand-Vergelesses. The slopes planted with the most valuable vineyards face south-east on the hilltop, with the land gradually sloping downwards towards the major French highway Route 74. The red wine appellation of Corton covers the lower part of the hill with the areas for Corton and Corton-Charlemagne partially overlapping. Furthermore, there is a third Grand Cru appellation on the Corton hill, Charlemagne, that may be used for white wine produced from the En Charlemagne lieu-dit. However, as En Charlemagne is only 0.28 hectares in size, production is limited and usually blended with grapes from the other lieu-dits of Corton-Charlemagne. As of 2012, the Corton-Charlemagne AOC was producing an average of 2,280 hectoliters of wine a year (around 304,000 bottles of wine) representing more than 2 out of every 3 bottles of all the Grand Cru class white wine produced throughout the C√¥te de Nuits and C√¥te de Beaune. Bonneau du Martray is the largest single owner of vines within the Corton-Charlemagne vineyard with 9.5 hectares. History and name The name of the Roman Emperor Otho was eventually corrupted into \\"Corton\\". The hill of Corton that the contains Corton- Charlemagne AOC is located behind (north/northwest) the commune of Aloxe- Corton. The commune itself has had a long history dating to its time as a 3rd- century AD Roman outpost on the road from Marseilles to Autun. It was known then as Aulociacum but over the centuries the name eventually evolved into Alossia, Alussa, Alouxe and then, by the turn of the 17th century, it was known as Aloxe. In 1862, the name \\"Corton\\" was appended to the name in reference to the notable Le Corton vineyards that already had wide recognition. The name Corton was a corruption of Curtis d'Orthon meaning Domaine of Otho in reference to the first-century Roman emperor. Vineyards were recorded on the hill by 696 AD though it very likely that they were planted much earlier. In the late 8th century AD, the land was owned by Charlemagne: in 775 he gave most of the hill of Corton to the Abbey of St. Andoche in Saulieu, which had been destroyed by Saracens in 731. Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne who, as King of the Franks, gave the hill of Corton to the abbey of St. Andoche. According to legend, Charlemagne noted to the Abbey sections of the slope where the snow melted first and ordered that grapevines be planted on that slope. His orders were followed and the hill of Corton was planted first entirely with red grape varieties. A couple decades later, Charlemagne's fourth wife Luitgard was said to be displeased with red wine drippings on the white beard of the king and ordered that a section of the hill be pulled up and replanted with white grape varieties‚Äîa section that is today known as Corton-Charlemagne. Though written records have noted acclaim for the white wine from the region as early as the 8th century, the early 19th century wine writer Andr√© Jullien made no mention of any white wine being made in Corton in his 1816 catalog of wine regions Topographie de tous les vignobles connus. However, Chardonnay is believed to be the \\"pinot blanc\\" mentioned by Dr. Jules Lavalle in his 1855 work on the terroir of the C√¥te d'Or, Histoire et Statistique de la Vigne de Grands Vins de la C√¥te-d'Or. In this work Lavalle noted that Pinot noir was planted on the middle slopes and lower ground of the Corton hill while \\"pinot blanc\\" was found on the higher slopes‚Äîan arrangement that is roughly the same as the vineyard plantings on the hill today. Geography and lieu-dits At the very top of the hill of Corton are the densely covered woodland known as the Bois de Corton. On the slopes just below the woodland, most of the clay topsoil has eroded away leaving a narrow band of oolitic limestone mixed with marl. This band of limestone, which has a radial exposition of 270 degrees stretching from the east-facing lieu-dits of Bassess Mourottes and Hautes Mourottes above Ladoix- Serrigny to down south and west to northwest facing lieu-dits of Le Charlemagne above Pernand-Vergelesses, is most suited for white wine grape varieties and have historically been the source for Corton-Charlemagne wine. Further down the slope, the vineyard soils transition from predominately limestone to having higher clay, iron, scree and ammonite fossil material that is most suited for red grape varieties. Here is found the lieu-dits of the Corton AOC though some vineyards, such as Le Rognet et Corton, Les Renardes, Le Corton, do have segments that overlap with the limestone band of Corton- Charlemagne. However, these vineyards, along with the Mourottes, are planted predominately with Pinot noir but the few Chardonnay plantings that do exist are permitted to be called Corton-Charlemagne. The lieu-dits responsible for the majority of Corton-Charlemagne are Le Charlemagne, Les Pouget and Les Languettes. Climate and viticulture The top of the hill of Corton is heavily wooded with Chardonnay planted on the upper reaches of the slope where the soil is mostly limestone. Further down the slope as the proportion of clay increases, Pinot noir is more likely to be found. As part of the Burgundy wine region, the hill of Corton shares the same continental climate as the rest of the C√¥te-d'Or. The particularly mesoclimate of Corton-Charlemagne is fractionally cooler, by a few growing degrees than the lower slopes that produce red Corton AOC. The majority of Corton-Charlemagne grapes come from the westerly exposed lieu-dits of Le Charlemagne and En Charlemagne. Being not as favorably exposed as the eastern facing lieu-dits of Corton, both the Chardonnay and few Pinot noir plantings on these slopes tend to ripen later than the Corton sectors, producing wines that tend to have slightly less body and richness to them. As Chardonnay buds early, it can be highly susceptible to spring time frost. However, it is a relatively hardy vine that can sustain cold winter temperatures unless they become extreme such as the hard freeze that devastated the 1985 vintage with temperatures dropping to -27 ¬∞C (-16.6 ¬∞F) in the winter, killing off a large portion of vines. As both Pinot noir and Chardonnay were affected on the hill of Corton, one long lasting result of this vintage is that the c√©page of many lieu-dits on the hill changed with some producers replanting their previously Chardonnay vineyards with Pinot noir to make Corton AOC and vice versa. Also many new clones and rootstocks were introduced. Beyond spring frost, the other viticulture hazard that growers have to worry about is court-nou√© (also known as roncet) which is a virus transmitted from vine to vine by nematodes that causes the vine to develop small leaves with short internode segments. This can impact a vine's ability to receive adequate foliage coverage to capture the sunlight needed to complete photosynthesis. Another hazard that Chardonnay is particularly susceptible to is oidium/powdery mildew. The Chardonnay vine has a tendency to produce excessive foliage which can hamper the ripening process with the vine diverting more energy to its leaves than to producing sugars and phenolics in the grape clusters. This requires Corton-Charlemagne growers to be limit the number of buds they leave with winter pruning and to be active during the growing season in leaf-pulling and removing excess shoots. =Wine grapes= Chardonnay is the only permitted grape in the AOC wines of Corton-Charlemagne. Today the only permitted grape in Corton-Charlemagne is Chardonnay. However, its presence on the hill is a relatively recent occurrence. Until the end of the 19th century, Aligot√© was the main grape variety with Pinot Beurot (Pinot gris) and Pinot blanc also being widely planted at one point. In fact, Master of Wine Remington Norman noted in his book The Great Domaines of Burgundy that when the white wines of Corton and Montrachet were receiving widespread recognition in the 8th century, during the period of Charlemagne, that it was likely from wine that was made from field blends of indigenous grape varieties rather than the single grape of Chardonnay that both regions are known for today. In Corton-Charlemagne, Chardonnay is valued for its ability to adapt to a variety of soils and micro-climates while reliably ripening to adequate sugar levels that don't necessitate much chaptalization. There is a risk, particularly with late-harvesting, that the acidity levels of the grape drop too much which can made a wine that is excessively flabby on the palate. AOC regulations and production figures A Corton-Charlemagne wine from Louis Latour. Wines labelled under the AOC designation Charlemagne and Corton- Charlemagne must be made from 100% Chardonnay that have been harvested at yields no greater than 40 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 2.7 tons/acre). There are no AOC specifications for aging prior to release but the finished wine must attain a minimum alcohol level of 12% by volume. In 1998, the combined Corton-Charlemagne and Charlemagne grand cru contained that produced 2325 hectoliters of Grand Cru white wine. By 2008, those figured changed only slightly with of vineyard surface being in production within the AOC producing 2,237 hectoliter of wine, corresponding to just under 300,000 bottles.BIVB: Les Appellations d‚ÄôOrigine Contr√¥l√©e de Bourgogne, accessed on November 3, 2009 =Charlemagne AOC and Corton blanc= Out of the three Grand Cru AOCs that are make up the hill of Corton, the Charlemagne AOC is the least used of these, as the majority of growers have elected to use the Corton-Charlemagne AOC for white wines from vineyards that are entitled to both appellations. In 2008, only of the En Charlemagne vineyard surface was in production for Charlemagne AOC, producing a total of 7 hectoliters (essentially three barrels worth of wine). Similarly, white wines made from lieu-dits primarily used for Corton AOC (approximately of Chardonnay producing around 88 hectoliters of wine) can be labeled as Corton-Charlemagne or as Corton blanc. Wine Corton-Charlemagne from n√©gociant and vineyard land owner Louis Latour. Master of Wine Clive Coates describes the Chardonnay of Corton-Charlemagne as being slower to mature than Montrachet with well-made examples from favorable vintages needing at least 10 years of aging before they are drinking at their peak. Coates note that the wines from the Pernand-Vergelesses side tend to have a flinty note and be characterized by more austerity than those from the Aloxe-Corton side that can be slightly more firm and full-bodied. Wine writer Tom Stevenson describes Corton-Charlemagne as \\"the most sumptuous of all white Burgundies\\" with rich buttery and fruit flavors and notes of cinnamon, vanilla and honey. Growers and producers Like most Grand cru vineyards in Burgundy ownership of the vines on Corton-Charlemagne is spread out among several growers with some doing estate bottling while other selling their portion of the crop to n√©gociants who combine it with the produce of other parcels to make a single Corton-Charlemagne wine. Among the owners of a 16 hectare section of Corton-Charlemagne that falls within the boundaries of the Aloxe is Hospices de Beaune and Maison Louis Latour while Bonneau du Martray owns a large part of the 19 hectare section along the Pernand-Vergelesses section with Domaine Comte Senard also having significant holdings.

It was the standard U.S. light field howitzer in World War II and saw action in both the European and Pacific theaters. Entering production in 1941, it quickly gained a reputation for accuracy and a powerful punch. The M101A1 fires 105 mm high explosive (HE) semi-fixed ammunition and has a range of , making it suitable for supporting infantry. All of these qualities of the weapon, along with its widespread production, led to its adoption by many countries after the war. Its ammunition type also became the standard for many foreign countries' later models. History =Development and designation= After World War I, the U.S. Army Ordnance Department studied various captured German 105 mm-caliber howitzers and developed the 105 mm Howitzer M1920 on Carriage M1920. A box trail carriage design (the M1925E carriage) and two other split trail designs (the T1 and T2) were also developed, but the original split trail design was found superior after testing. After being selected, the piece was standardized in December 1927 as the 105 mm howitzer M1 on carriage M1. The Army had an intention to replace all 75 mm gun-howitzers in its divisional and non- divisional field artillery regiments with 105 mm pieces, but a lack of appropriations stalled the idea and eventually forced it to be completely abandoned by 1929; a limited plan developed in 1925 envisioned re-equipping three regiments, but by 1933, only 14 M1 howitzers had been manufactured, A modified version of the M1 was trialed in 1932 which used semi-fixed ammunition instead of separate-loading ammunition. Since this development required a different breech block, the new piece was designated the 105 mm howitzer M2 on carriage M1. 48 pieces were manufactured in 1939. The original M1 carriage had been designed for towing using horses rather than trucks, and a new carriage, the T5 (M2), was developed in 1939 and standardized in February 1940. The breech ring of the howitzer M2 was modified in March 1940 before large-scale production began, creating the 105 mm howitzer M2A1 on carriage M2. The weapon was heavy for its calibre but this was because the gun was designed to be durable. Thus the barrel and carriage could see great use and remain functional without wearing out.Bishop, Chris. The encyclopedia of weapons of world War II. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2002, p.139 The U.S. military artillery designation system was changed in 1962, redesignating the M2A1 howitzer the M101A1. The gun continued to see service in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Though a similar model, the M102 howitzer, shared the same roles in battle, it never fully replaced the M101A1. Today, the M101A1 has been retired by the U.S. military, though it continues to see service with many other countries. By the end of the Second World War, 8,536 105 mm towed howitzers had been built and post-war production continued at Rock Island Arsenal until 1953, by which time 10,202 had been built. =Use by non-US militaries = The Canadian Forces used the M2A1 as the C2 howitzer until 1997, when a modification was made to extend its service life; it is now designated the C3. The changes include a longer barrel, a muzzle brake, reinforced trails and the removal of shield flaps. It remains the standard light howitzer of Canadian Forces Reserve units. The C3 is used by Reserve units in Glacier National Park in British Columbia as a means of avalanche control. France and the State of Vietnam used M2A1 howitzers during the First Indochina War, as did the Viet Minh guerilla forces they fought against, who were supplied with at least 24 by the People's Republic of China, along with other captured American artillery pieces and mortars formerly operated by both Nationalist Chinese forces (the Kuomintang military) and US troops fighting in Korea. Today upgraded M2A1 howitzers (some of which have been mounted on trucks and employed as self-propelled artillery) are still being used by the People's Army of Vietnam (the PAVN). The French Army used the M2 howitzer, designated HM2, in the Algerian War and during the Op√©ration Tacaud in Chad. France later supplied a battery of HM2 to the Rwandan Armed Forces during the Rwandan Civil War that led into the Rwandan genocide. =Present use= In addition, the M101 has found a second use in the U.S. as an avalanche control gun, supervised by the US Forest Service and the US Army TACOM's cooperative effort in the Avalanche Artillery Users of North America Committee (AAUNAC). The M101 is used by a number of ski areas and state departments of transportation for long-range control work. Under the designation of M2A2, the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Field Artillery Regiment, 428th Field Artillery Brigade performs salutes with 7 guns with World War Two Medal of Honor recipient names on their barrels. A number of M2/M101 howitzers were used by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and approximately 50 were inherited by Croatia, of which four are still in use for training with the Croatian Army. M2 Howitzers are still in limited service in the Australian Army Reserve, but are being replaced with mortars with an emphasis on the retention of indirect fire support skills. In regular service they were replaced by the 105 mm L119 Hamel gun and the M198 howitzers. Two M2 howitzers (1942) are still employed in providing the gun salute at Kristiansten Fortress, in Trondheim, Norway. M101/M2 is one of three approved salute guns in the Norwegian armed forces, and have been reduced to a caliber of for this purpose. They are used for gun salute also at Rena and Setermoen. Five M101A1 howitzers are owned by the Virginia Military Institute and are used for parades, evening retreat and other ceremonies.

It is chambered in .45 ACP and is rated to accept +P ammunition. Design The pistol has a proprietary integral accessory rail, and a thumb safety which doubles as a slide lock. The weapon uses the .45 ACP cartridge, and is the largest pistol that Hi-Point manufactures. All of Hi-Point's handguns use a blowback design similar to that used in the German Walther PPK and Russian Makarov PM. In blowback weapons the return spring and mass of the slide absorbs the rearward force generated by the propulsion of the bullet. As the slide moves back, an extractor hooks the empty casing by the rim and pulls it out of the chamber after which the case is ejected. After the slide has completed its rearward travel, the recoil spring moves the slide forward, also chambering another round. Many modern handguns use a locked-breech design and therefore do not require the amount of mass that the blowback design requires in order to remain safe to fire. Because all Hi-Point firearms are rated for +P ammunition the slides are even heftier than what would otherwise be necessary. When the last round is fired and ejected, the slide will lock in the open position. There is no slide release on the Hi-Point .45 JHP, so releasing the slide is performed by pulling the locked slide further back. When another magazine is loaded into the weapon all that is necessary is a short pull back, unlike the full length pull to chamber the first round. Out of the box this pistol is mounted with a typical 3-dot sight and also includes a free ghost ring sight. Along with the sights the weapon comes with a trigger lock and other combinations are available as well such as a hard plastic storage case, a metal lock box, and a belt holster. It's available in plain black, pink camouflage, woodland camouflage, and digital desert camouflage. The gun's barrel has a 7 groove right hand twist, and the proprietary integrated accessory rail only fits a Hi-Point LaserLyte laser sight or ¬æ inch laser ring. Due to the fixed barrel, accuracy is well above average, on par with higher priced pistols this weapon remains popular due to its low cost and lifetime, no questions asked warranty, and extremely rugged nature. While Hi-Point Firearms gives free repairs for the entire life of the gun, most competitors in the firearms industry only offer lifetime warranties for the first owner. Some aftermarket upgrades or modifications not sold by Hi-Point are available such as a milled aluminum rear sight, wood grips, a replacement magazine catch that converts the pistol to use 1911 magazines, a milled aluminum trigger, and a stainless steel guide rod. Also, the magazine spring is also approximately the same size as the Glock 43, for which there are stronger aftermarket springs available. Criticisms Hi-Point handguns have been criticized for their weight and size, however, they do help to reduce recoil. The JHP has also been known to have issues with magazine feeds and feed jams. To remedy this some owners have reported good results bending the feed lips of the magazine and replacing the magazine spring. Some consider the lack of a firing pin block safety mechanism in the striker fired design to be inherently less safe than other designs and, therefore not safe to carry in Condition One. However other firearms are similar in design such as the 1911. Field stripping a Hi-Point requires the use of a punch to remove a pin, while most modern pistols can be disassembled for cleaning without the use of additional tools.

Written by and starring Paul Whitehouse and Chris Langham, it concerns a psychotherapist (Langham) and his therapy sessions with a variety of patients, almost all of whom are played by Whitehouse. Peter Strong, the diffident psychologist, has an obsession with his receptionist Rebecca (played by Alison King) and also has regular appointments with his own therapist (who is also played by Whitehouse), the only times when the scene leaves Peter's office. Other performers are Mark Williams and Olivia Colman in cameos as patients, Alison Senior as a patient's wife, and Langham's real-life daughter Emily as a patient's precocious daughter. Two of the most frequent patients are Gary (the only role Whitehouse plays with no make-up), who initially uses his therapy sessions to escape from his wife; and Monty, an elderly Jewish taxi-driver whose wife is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Others include an Eastern European father, a magician and a TV presenter. The show was released on Region 4 DVD, but has so far remained unreleased in the UK. Interviewed by Ben Thompson for The Guardian in 2005, Langham said, of his writing partnership with Whitehouse: > The way Paul works is to try and come up with a phrase that suits a > particular voice ... That's the grain of sand around which the pearl of a > character forms. Once he's found that voice, he's volcanic - it all comes > out of him in a stream of consciousness which I can't type fast enough to > keep up with. Then my rather less glamorous and exciting job would be to > take that stuff and shape it, which was fine by me, as I'm kind of obsessed > with structure. In 2007 the development of Pedro, a character in the proposed second series - which was never made - became a focal point of Langham's trial. Swedish version A Swedish remake, Hj√§lp!, was broadcast on Swedish television in 2007‚Äì2009. The psychologist Jeanette Plaszczyk was played by Stina Ekblad.

The station conflicts with WGER of Saginaw, Michigan, in Genesee and Lapeer Counties, though those with directional antennas can tune either station in these areas. The 106.3 FM signal has been heard as far south as Monroe, Michigan; however, reception can be difficult due to FM translator W292DK in Oak Park, Michigan which is also on 106.3 FM. This situation tends to cause interference in southern St. Clair County, as well as in Macomb County. In Ontario, interference seems minimal. History Dancy Broadcasting launched the station in 1969, as an AM station with the callsign CKJD and a contemporary MOR format. The station's original AM frequency was 1250 AM. Rogers Communications acquired it in 1972, and moved to 1110 AM in 1977. In 1981, Rogers also launched an FM sister station, CJFI. CKJD and CJFI were sold to Maclean-Hunter subsidiary Blue Water Broadcasting in 1987. The following year, CKJD adopted a country music format with the new call sign CKTY.

He served as a Member of the Lebanese parliament until his resignation, on 5th August 2020, after the 2020 Beirut explosions, due to the government being \\"ineffective\\". Early life and education Marwan Hamadeh, also written as Marouan Hamad√© (preferred French transliteration) was born into a Druze family in Baakleen, Chouf district, on 11 September 1939. His step brother, Ali Hamade, An Nahar journalist who was a member of Saad Hariri‚Äôs political party is married to Nadine Jabbour Hamade. His sister, Nadia Tueni, a notable author and French poet, was married to Ghassan Tueni, former UN ambassador and senior editor of the Lebanese daily, An Nahar. Their son, and Hamadeh's nephew, Gebran Tueni, was assassinated in a car bombing in Beirut in December 2005. Hamad√© holds a law degree, which he earned from Saint Joseph University in 1963. He received a PhD in economy from the same university. Career and views Hamad√© started his career as an economic and political editor for An Nahar, L'Orient le Jour and Le Point in 1964 and continued to work for these papers until 1975. He was appointed tourism minister in 1982 and his term lasted for two years. He served as economy minister in the cabinet led by then prime minister Omar Karami, replacing Nazih Al Bizri.

Hamad√© was one of four members of the Lebanese Parliament who voted against the extension of president Lahoud‚Äôs term in office in September 2004. Hamadeh, formerly one of Syria's staunchest allies in Lebanon, became a critic of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon after Resolution 1559 was passed in 2005. Hamad√© and the same three other cabinet members, including culture minister Ghazi Aridi, environment minister Far√®s Boueiz and refugee affairs minister Abdullah Farhat, also resigned from office on 7 September 2004 in protest at the constitutional amendment that allowed the three-year extension of then President √âmile Lahoud's term.

It is based on the Disney cartoon Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, about Chip and Dale, two crime-fighting chipmunks. It is a sequel to the 1990 video game. The game was included in The Disney Afternoon Collection compilation for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One released in April 2017. Gameplay Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 2 is a platform game featuring single and 2-player cooperative modes. As with the first game, each individual stage is set up as a side-scrolling action game where Chip and Dale can walk, jump, duck, and pick up objects such as acorns, crates, barrels, and balls to throw at enemies and bosses. Each character can withstand only three direct hits before they lose a life, though it is possible to earn more hits over the course of the game. Unlike the first game, there is no map screen as the stages are set in a linear order. The only exception is at the amusement park, in which the first three stages can be played in any order before entering the final stage. In a one-player game, the player can choose to be either Chip or Dale. In a two-player game, Player 1 is Chip and Player 2 is Dale. A new feature added to this game from the first is the ability for one player to pick up and throw the other as a weapon. Plot The Rescue Rangers catch a news report stating that a bomb has been set to explode at a local restaurant. At once, Chip, Dale, Gadget, Monterey Jack, and Zipper set off to defuse the explosive before it goes off. While there, they manage to corner the rabbit responsible for setting the bomb, who admits that it was Fat Cat who ordered him to do it (having broken out of prison the night before) so he can steal a relic called the Urn of the Pharaoh from a docked cargo ship. The Rangers give chase to the docks. After a search of the ship turns up nothing, Zipper then spots Fat Cat running into a warehouse. Chip and Dale follow him inside, but are ambushed and locked in a refrigerator to freeze. Though the chipmunks escape in time, Fat Cat opens the Urn and releases the evil spirits contained within it. As the warehouse fills with ghosts, Chip and Dale manage to retrieve the Urn and seal it up again. Fat Cat then challenges the Rescue Rangers to meet him at the amusement park for a final showdown. After navigating through the attractions (Clock Tower, Western World, and Future World), Chip and Dale unlock the door to the control room, where Fat Cat attacks them with a giant robot modelled after himself. Once it's destroyed, Chip and Dale go after Fat Cat while the ceiling begins to collapse, but are unable to find him and are forced to escape. Reunited, the Rescue Rangers swear that they'll stop Fat Cat the next time he shows up. Reception Rescue Rangers 2 received mostly positive reviews in North America, with Electronic Gaming Monthly commenting that \\"for an 8-bit platform, Rescue Rangers comes off rather well and, if anything, makes you wish for a 16-bit version!\\" GamePro similarly urged players to \\"dust off their 8-bit\\" console for the game, praising the title's \\"chipper\\" music and \\"cute\\" sound effects, but found that it lacked adequate challenge, writing that \\"Rescue 2's about as challenging as the original - perfect for beginners or intermediate players, but a tad easy for anyone else.\\" Game Players also declared that the gameplay was \\"simple\\", but that it lived up to previous Capcom and Disney collaborative projects with its \\"top\\" graphics and responsive controls.

Production Throughout production, director Les Blank and his small crew became exhausted and exasperated from the stress of the work. Blank said that he felt ‚Äúunconnected to the people around me‚Äù. Keeping up with the antics of Herzog and Klaus Kinski (the film‚Äôs star) proved difficult for the reserved, introverted Blank. By the last week of production, he was so burnt out that he feared coming out of production \\"like some Viet Nam veterans, horribly calloused\\". He wrote in his journal, \\"I'm tired of it all and I couldn't care less if they move the stupid ship ‚Äì or finish the fucking film\\". Blank would often ask Herzog to repeat statements while being filmed that he originally made off-camera. In a 2009 interview with Jesse Pearson for Vice magazine, Blank was asked to recall a scene in the documentary showing Herzog delivering a monologue about the violence and destruction of the jungle around him. Blank says that the scene originally took place in the middle of a canoe ride, away from cameras, but he liked the speech enough to coax it out of Herzog again. \\"When the moment was right,\\" Blank told Vice, \\"I pulled him aside and said, 'Can I do a little interview?' And he said, 'Sure.' Goodwin led him around to something that sparked him off on that tangent again.

Lilienthal (born September 4, 1940) is an American lawyer, camp director, and philanthropist best known for his humanitarian work in Ethiopia and South Africa. Early life and education Lilienthal is one of two sons born to Emmy Lou (n√©e Asch) and Howard Lilienthal, an attorney. He has one brother, Robert Lilienthal. A graduate of Amherst College in 1962, Lilienthal attended law school at the University of Virginia, receiving his J.D. in 1965. Upon graduation Lilienthal joined the Peace Corps and established Camp Langano, Ethiopia's first sleepaway summer camp. It served primarily inner city youths from Addis Ababa. In 1967, Lilienthal's Peace Corps service ended and he handed over control of Camp Langano to the YMCA, which ran it continuously until the overthrow of Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie I in 1974. Camp Winnebago In 1974, following the unexpected death of his father Howard, Lilienthal assumed his father's position as the director of Camp Winnebago, one of Maine's most prestigious and venerable boys' summer camps. The institution, above all, instills in its campers the practice of virtuous behavior and upright character and has even coined for itself a term to describe these qualities, \\"Winnebagan\\". Lilienthal's tenure as camp director was marked by a number of achievements, including an increase in the number of international campers and counselors, the creation and expansion of a scholarship program for underprivileged youths, and the construction of a great number of new facilities, including new tennis courts, soccer and baseball fields, volleyball and basketball courts, a hockey rink, a ropes course and a historically valuable museum on the premises. He served in the position until his retirement in 2003, when he passed control of the camp to his elder son, Andrew. Notable Alums:  Global Camps Africa  After his retirement from Winnebago, Lilienthal established Global Camps Africa, originally, WorldCamps‚Äîan organization dedicated to helping AIDS-affected youths throughout Africa. Camp Sizanani, Lilienthal's first foray with Global Camps Africa, formed in partnership with South African NGO, HIVSA, has been a major success, creating a vital support network for some of South Africa's neediest children. Lilienthal continues to work tirelessly for AIDS-affected children throughout all of Africa. In June 2013, Lilienthal was awarded the prestigious Sargent Shriver Award for Distinguished Humanitarian Service by the Peace Corps.

The Penn Plaza complex remains one of the most controversial in New York City history because it involved the destruction, beginning in 1963, of the original McKim, Mead and White-designed Penn Station (1910), a revered piece of New York architecture. Its replacements were what architects and civic purists regard as mediocre office and entertainment structures. The demolition of the first Penn Station led to the city's landmarks preservation movement and helped save another landmark of railway architecture, Grand Central Terminal.

The gun was developed by the design bureau of the plant no 172, headed by F. F. Petrov, as a deep upgrade of the 152-mm gun M1910/34, in turn based on the 152-mm siege gun M1910, a pre-World War I design by Schneider. It was in production from 1937 to 1946. The ML-20 saw action in World War II, mainly as a corps / army level artillery piece of the Soviet Army. Captured guns were employed by Wehrmacht and the Finnish Army. Post World War II, the ML-20 saw combat in numerous conflicts during the mid to late twentieth century. Description US Army Ordnance Museum; note spoked wheels. The ML-20 was officially classified as howitzer-gun, i.e. an artillery system which combines characteristics of a howitzer and (to lesser extent) of a gun and therefore can be used in both roles. This universality was achieved by wide range of elevation angles and by using separate loading with 13 different propellant loads. The gun was fitted with both telescopic sight for direct fire and panoramic sight for an indirect one. For ballistic calculations and meteorological corrections a special mechanical device was developed. The device, called meteoballistic summator, consisted of a specialized slide rule and a pre-calculated table. After World War II similar devices were introduced for other types of guns. The barrel was either monobloc or built-up. Some sources indicate that a third type‚Äîwith loose liner‚Äîalso existed. To soften recoil, a large slotted muzzle brake was fitted. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, with forced extraction of cartridge during opening. A safety lock prevented opening of the breechblock before the shot; if there was a need to remove a shell, the lock had to be disabled. To assist loading when the barrel was set to high elevation angle, the breech was equipped with cartridge holding mechanism. The gun was fired by pulling a trigger-cord. The recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and hydro-pneumatic recuperator. Each held 22 litres of liquid. Pressure in the recuperator reached 45 Bar. The carriage was of split trail type, with shield and balancing mechanism, leaf spring suspension and steel wheels with rubber tires (some early production pieces received spoked wheels with solid tires from M1910/34). During transportation the barrel was usually retracted. The gun could also be towed with the barrel in its normal position, but in this case the transportation speed was limited, about 4‚Äì5 km/h (compared to 20 km/h with barrel pulled back). The gun could be set up for combat in 8‚Äì10 minutes. The carriage, designated 52-L-504A, was also used in the 122-mm gun model 1931/37 (A-19). This gun was also mounted in two Soviet assault guns/tank destroyers employed during WWII. These are the SU-152 and ISU-152. Development history Among other artillery pieces the Red Army (RKKA) inherited from the Imperial Russian Army a 152-mm siege gun M1910, developed by Schneider. The gun was modernized twice in 1930s, resulting in the 152-mm gun M1910/30 and the 152-mm gun M1910/34. However, its mobility, maximum elevation and speed of traverse still needed improvement. In 1935-36 the No. 172 Plant in Motovilikha tried to continue the modernization works, but the Main Artillery Directorate (GAU) insisted on more significant upgrade. Consequently, the design bureau of the plant developed two guns ML-15 and ML-20. While the former project was initiated by GAU, the latter started as private development; the team working on it was led by F. F. Petrov. Both guns used barrel and recoil system of the M1910/34. The ML-20 also inherited the wheels, suspension and trails from the older gun. The ML-15 reached ground tests in April 1936, was returned for revision and was tested again in March 1937, this time successfully. The ML-20 went through ground tests in December 1936 and through army tests next year. After some defects (mostly in carriage) were eliminated, the ML-20 was recommended for production and on 22 September 1937 it was adopted as 152-mm howitzer-gun model 1937 (). It is not clear why the ML-20 was preferred. The ML-15 was lighter (about 500 kg less in combat position, 600 kg in traveling position) and more mobile (maximum transportation speed 45 km/h). On the negative side, the ML-15 had a more complicated carriage (however, the final version of the ML-20 carriage incorporated some features of the ML-15). Some sources claim that the choice was made because of the economic factor‚Äîthe ML-20 was more similar to the M1910/34, thus requiring fewer adjustments for production. Production history The gun was in production from 1937‚Äì1946. 6,884 guns were manufactured and about 4,000 ML-20S barrels were used in the SU-152 and ISU-152 self-propelled guns. The ML-20 was eventually replaced by the D-20 152 mm gun with identical ballistics, which entered production in 1956. { border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:95%; background:#fff; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line-height:1.5; font-size:95%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text- align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff; font- weight:bold;\\"  colspan=\\"12\\" Production of –úL-20s, pcs.Shirokorad A.

First, most of the barrels produced in these years were ML-20S. Second, after the Soviets started to field heavy tanks such as the JS series that used the A-19 122mm gun, the plant was ordered to increase the production of the A-19 instead of the ML-20.Zheltov I.

ML-20 in H√§meenlinna Artillery Museum, Finland. ML-20 in H√§meenlinna Artillery Museum, Finland. ML-20 in Batey ha-Osef Museum, Israel. =Red Army= The ML-20 was originally intended for corps artillery. Together with the 122-mm gun A-19 it formed a so-called \\"corps duplex\\". In 1940-41 there were three types of corps artillery regiments: *With two battalions of ML-20 and one of either A-19 or 107-mm guns (a total of 24 ML-20s). *With two battalions of ML-20 and two of either A-19 or 107-mm guns (a total of 24 ML-20s). *With three battalions of ML-20 (a total of 36 ML-20s). Soon after the outbreak of Operation Barbarossa, the corps artillery was eliminated (as rifle corps themselves were eliminated). It was restored later in the war. The new corps artillery regiments were supposed to be armed with 122-mm guns or 152-mm howitzers, but some memoirs mention that the ML-20 was also used. From 1943 the gun was employed by artillery regiments of armies. Such regiments had 18 ML-20s. Guard armies from early 1945 had artillery brigades with 36 ML-20s. The ML-20 also used by artillery regiments (24 pieces) and brigades (36 pieces) of the Reserve of the Main Command. It was primarily used for indirect fire against enemy personnel, fortifications and key objects in the near rear. Heavy fragments of the OF-540 HE-Fragmentation shell were capable of piercing armour up to 20‚Äì30 mm thick, making a barrage dangerous to thinly armored vehicles and to some extent to heavier armoured ones as the fragments could damage chassis, sights or other elements; sometimes a close explosion caused damage inside a vehicle even though the armour remained intact. Direct hit of a shell often resulted in tearing away a turret of a medium tank or jamming it in case of a heavy tank. The first combat use of the ML-20 was in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, in limited numbers.Kolomiets M. - The Battle of River Khalkhin-Gol. It also saw combat in the Winter War against the Mannerheim Line fortifications. The gun continued to be used throughout the World War II. Excellent characteristics of the gun, including reliability and ease of maintenance, allowed it to remain in service with the Soviet Army for a long time after the war. =Other operators= In the early stage of the German invasion of the Soviet Union hundreds of ML-20 were captured by the Wehrmacht. The gun was adopted by Germans as 15.2 cm KH.433/1(r). From February 1943 Germans manufactured ammunition for the gun. The Finnish Army captured 37 guns of the type in 1941‚Äì44 and received additional 27 from Germany. These guns were adopted as 152 H 37. A number of barrels were mated with carriages of A-19 to create 152 H 37-31. While the gun was generally liked, the Finnish Army didn't possess enough prime movers suitable for towing such a massive piece. As a result, some of the guns were assigned to coastal artillery. Two pieces were captured back by the Red Army. A number of these guns were modernized in 1988 and as of 2004 still remain in reserve as 152 H 88-37. (all of the 152 H 88 series are being withdrawn as of 2007). After the war the ML-20 was widely exported to Warsaw Pact allies and to many states in Asia and Africa (in some of those states the gun still remains in service). It was adopted by Egypt and Syria and saw action in Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. In 2002 a TV documentary featured ML-20 employed by the Afghan Northern Alliance forces against the Taliban fighters; it seems likely that the guns were initially supplied to the Najibullah's regime. Variants The barrel was manufactured in two variants ‚àí monobloc or built-up. Some sources indicate that a third type - with loose liner - also existed. Except the basic variant, the only variant to reach mass production was the ML-20S, developed for use in self-propelled guns, with differently placed controls for easier operation in small enclosed compartments. *ML-20 with bag loading ‚Äì In 1937 the Main Artillery Department decided, for economic reasons, to modify medium caliber guns to use bag loading instead of cased loading. An experimental ML-20 piece was built in 1939; the trials were unsuccessful. *ML-20SM ‚Äì Modified ML-20S with identical ballistics. muzzle brake was removed. The gun was mounted in the experimental ISU-152 model 1945, of which only one unit was built. Lubuskie Military Museum *BL-20 ‚Äì ML-20 with cast breech and wedge breechblock.

Summary The ML-20 was one of the most successful Soviet artillery pieces of World War II. Its characteristics positioned it between classical short-range howitzers and special long-range guns. Compared to the former, the ML-20 has better range (e.g. the German 15 cm sFH 18 had range of 13.3 km), which often allowed it to shell positions of enemy artillery while remaining immune to enemy fire. Its advantage over the latter was in weight and cost, and therefore in mobility and production rate. For example, the German 15 cm K 39 with range of 24.7 km weighed 12.2 tons and only 61 pieces were built; of the excellent 17 cm K 18 (23.4 t, 29.6 km) 338 pieces were manufactured; lighter 10.5 cm sK 18 (5.6 t, 19.1 km) was more common (2,135 pieces) but its 15 kg shell was much less powerful than a 44 kg shell of ML-20. German attempts to produce an analogue to the ML-20 were unsuccessful. The 15 cm sFH 40 was never produced due to construction defects; the 15 cm sFH 42 had insufficient range and only 46 pieces were built. In 1943 and 1944 Wehrmacht announced requirements for a 15 cm howitzer with a range of 18 km, but none reached production. Of other guns with more or less similar characteristics, there were French 155 mm guns model 1917 and 1918 with longer range, but some 3.5 tons heavier (as was the US 155 mm Long Tom). The Czechoslovakian howitzer K4 (used by Germans as 15 cm sFH 37(t)) was about 2 tons lighter, but with range more than 2 km shorter and only 178 pieces were built. The British BL 5.5 inch (140 mm) Medium Gun probably had the closest characteristics; weight slightly over six tons and range of with an shell. The main shortcomings of the ML-20 were its weight and limited mobility. As the experience of the ML-15 project suggests, the gun could be made somewhat lighter and more suitable for high-speed transportation. The use of a muzzle brake can be seen as a minor flaw: while softening the recoil and thus allowing the use of a lighter carriage, a muzzle brake has the disadvantage of redirecting some of the gases that escape the barrel toward the ground, where they can raise dust, potentially revealing the gun position. But when the ML-20 was developed, muzzle brakes were already a common design element in artillery pieces of that class.

District and school history The Hunterdon Central Regional High School School District was created by referendum on April 4, 1954, and the high school opened in the former Route 69 Elementary School in September, 1956.Fernekes, William R. Ed. D and Harlene Z. Rosenberg, editors. Hunterdon Central Regional High School: 50th Anniversary Souvenir Yearbook 1956-2006. pp. 3-4 There were a few impetuses that led to the creation of the district. Before 1956, public school students of the school districts of Delaware, East Amwell and Readington Townships were sent to Flemington High School as tuition students, but these districts had no voice on the Flemington-Raritan Board of Education, which administered the school. Additionally, Flemington High's facilities could no longer support the growing student population, nor could its plant support the offering of a more broad- based curriculum that was becoming standard among American high schools in the post-WWII era.Fernekes, William R. Ed. D and Harlene Z. Rosenberg, editors. Hunterdon Central Regional High School: 50th Anniversary Souvenir Yearbook 1956-2006. pp. 6-7 A statute passed by the New Jersey Legislature in 1931 permitted two or more municipalities to create regionalized school districts so that all member municipalities had representation and authority as members of a regional board of education, as well as the benefit of being able to pool tax resources and share the cost of running a school district.Bole, Robert D. and Laurence R. Johnson. The New Jersey High School: A History. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand, 1964. qtd. in Fernekes, William R. Ed. D and Harlene Z. Rosenberg, editors. Hunterdon Central Regional High School: 50th Anniversary Souvenir Yearbook 1956-2006. pp. 3-4 When the new HCRHS Board of Education purchased the Route 69 elementary school, its facilities were expanded to accommodate 1,000 students with the passage of a bond act in December 1954. The Board selected Robert Shoff to be the district's first superintendent. When the school opened in 1956 most of the program and faculty from the former Flemington High School was transported to the new school and district. Throughout the 1960s, HCRHS expanded its curriculum to offer vocational training, work force and college education. The new facilities allowed for a more varied curriculum including an expanded world languages program, agricultural education programs, a music and performing arts program (curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular) and continuing expansion of the Red Devils athletic program.Fernekes, William R. Ed. D and Harlene Z. Rosenberg, editors. Hunterdon Central Regional High School: 50th Anniversary Souvenir Yearbook 1956-2006. Additionally, the physical plant was expanded in 1962 and then again in a massive expansion begun in 1969. By 1970 the campus consisted of the 9/10 building, the 11/12 building, a separate Instructional Media Center (library), a fieldhouse and separate fine arts building. Connecting all of these buildings to one another was a covered walkway to shield students from the elements when passing from class to class. In 1974, radio station WCVH-FM 90.5 began broadcasting from the campus of Hunterdon Central, and it was the first NJ radio station to be part of the National Public Radio network. Today WCVH still features student programming as well as programs of local interest.Fernekes, William R. Ed. D and Harlene Z. Rosenberg, editors. Hunterdon Central Regional High School: 50th Anniversary Souvenir Yearbook 1956-2006. p. 33 Since 1987 Hunterdon Central has had the word \\"Regional\\" as an official part of its name. Prior to that it was known as Hunterdon Central High School. Other plant renovations occurred in the 1980s, and in 1984 lights were installed on the football field.Fernekes, William R. Ed. D and Harlene Z. Rosenberg, editors. Hunterdon Central Regional High School: 50th Anniversary Souvenir Yearbook 1956-2006. p. 51. In the 1990s Hunterdon Central embarked upon massive upgrades to the facility and infrastructure. Former superintendent Raymond Farley committed the district to embracing educational technology, and to this day the high school is known for embracing the use of technology as a tool of learning and education. In the late 1990s, the 11/12 building was expanded with the addition of 34 classrooms and the Commons. Elevators were also added to the 9/10 campus as the result of a lawsuit filed against the district by student who used a wheelchair and was unable to navigate all parts of that campus. In this decade WCVH moved to its present location in the newly renovated and expanded Communications Building (formerly the Fine Arts Building), and HCTV, Hunterdon Central's own cable television station, began broadcasting. The 2000s saw the most recent expansion of the Hunterdon Central facilities with the addition of 23 new classrooms, a gymnasium and the complete renovation of all 47 classrooms in the 9/10 building. Air conditioning was also installed in the 9/10 building and athletic fields received upgrades.Fernekes, William R. Ed. D and Harlene Z. Rosenberg, editors. Hunterdon Central Regional High School: 50th Anniversary Souvenir Yearbook 1956-2006. p. 81. HCRHS also began random drug testing of students participating in athletics, co-curricular activities, extra-curricular activities and parking on campus. This was in response to indications that there was a dangerous level of drug use among students at HCRHS, including more than 30% who had indicated in surveys that they had used drugs in the previous year and 27 students who had tested positive after undergoing drug tests that had been performed based on reasonable suspicion that the students had been using drugs. Through this program the district attempts to get help and assistance to students who test positive for illegal drugs, as well as to further its commitment to anti-drug education. Some students and parent accepted the testing as a reasonable way to deter students from using drugs and participating in unhealthy lifestyles. The policy was challenged by members of the community and students who believed that it was unjustified and invaded student privacy, eventually taking the case to the Supreme Court of New Jersey. In Joye, et al. v Hunterdon Central HCRHS was found not to be in violation of a student's right to be free from search and seizure, but the court did not comment on the merits of the random drug testing policy. All HCRHS students wishing to participate in any of these activities, or to park on campus, must submit their names to the random drug testing pool. Other schools in the state and region have adopted policies similar to Hunterdon Central's.Joye, et al. v. Hunterdon Central Regional High School Board of Education. Supreme Court of New Jersey. 2003., Caselaw. Accessed June 28, 2013. Technology plays an important role in instruction at Hunterdon Central and its use in the classroom continues to grow.

Since 1946, it has played a major role in Syria's governance, mounting six military coups: two in 1949, including the March 1949 Syrian coup d'√©tat and the August 1949 coup by Colonel Sami al- Hinnawi, and one each in 1954, 1963, 1966, and 1970. It has fought four wars with Israel (1948, the Six-Day War in 1967, the October War of 1973, and 1982 in Lebanon) and one with Jordan (Black September in Jordan, 1970). An armored division was also deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1990‚Äì91 during the Persian Gulf War, but saw little action. From 1976 to 2005 it was the major pillar of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Internally, it played a major part in suppressing the 1979‚Äì82 Islamist uprising in Syria, and since early 2011 has been heavily engaged in fighting the Syrian Civil War, the most violent and prolonged war the Syrian Army has taken part in since its establishment in the 1940s.  History  In 1919, the French formed the Troupes sp√©ciales du Levant as part of the Army of the Levant in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. The former with 8,000 men later grew into both the Syrian and Lebanese armies. This force was used primarily as auxiliaries in support of French troops, and senior officer posts were held by Frenchmen, although Syrians were allowed to hold commissions below the rank of major. As Syria gained independence in 1946, its leaders envisioned a division-sized army. On June 19, 1947, the Syrian Army took the survivors of Pan Am Flight 121 to the Presbyterian mission hospital at Deir ez-Zor. The 1st Brigade was ready by the time of the Syrian war against Israel on May 15, 1948. It consisted of two infantry battalions and one armored battalion. The 2nd Brigade was organized during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and also included two infantry battalions and one armored battalion.Morris, Benny (2008), 1948: A History of the First Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, p. 251. Yale University Press. . At the time of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the army was small, poorly armed, and poorly trained. \\"Paris had relied primarily on French regulars to keep the peace in Syria and had neglected indigenous forces. Consequently, training was lackadaisical, discipline lax, and staff work almost unheard of. ... there were about 12,000 men in the Syrian army. These troops were mostly grouped into three infantry brigades and an armored force of about battalion size\\" writes Pollack. Between 1948 and 1967, a series of military coups destroyed the stability of the government and any remaining professionalism within the army. In March 1949, the chief of staff, General Husni al-Za'im, installed himself as president. Two more military dictators followed by December 1949. General Adib Shishakli then held power until deposed in the 1954 Syrian coup d'etat. Further coups followed, each attended by a purge of the officer corps to remove supporters of the losers from the force. 'Discipline in the army broke down across the board as units and their commanders pledged their allegiance to different groups and parties. Indeed, by the late 1950s, the situation had become so bad that Syrian officers regularly disobeyed the orders of superiors who belonged to different ethnic or political groups' writes Pollack. The 1963 Syrian coup d'√©tat had as one of its key objectives the seizure of the Al-Kiswah military camp, home to the 70th Armored Brigade. There was another 1966 Syrian coup d'etat. However, in 1967 the army did appear to have some strength. It had around 70,000 personnel, roughly 550 tanks and assault guns, 500 APCs, and nearly 300 artillery pieces. The army had sixteen brigades: twelve infantry, two armored (probably including the 70th Armored), and two mechanized. The Syrian government deployed twelve of the sixteen brigades to the Golan, including both armored brigades and one mechanized brigade. Three 'brigade groups', each comprising four brigades, were deployed: the 12th in the north, holding the sector from the B'nat Ya'acov bridge to the slopes of Mount Hermon, the 35th in the south from the B'nat Ya'acov bridge to the Yarmuk River border with Jordan, and the 42nd in reserve, earmarked for a theater- level counterattack role. During the Six-Day War Israeli assault of the Golan heights, the Syrian army failed to counterattack the Israelis as the Israelis breached the Syrian positions. While Syrian units fought hard whenever the Israelis entered their fields of fire, no attempts appear to have been made to exploit Israeli disorientation and confusion during the initial assault. Judging from reports of 1967‚Äì1970, including the reporting of the 5th Infantry Division in 1970, the Army appears to have formed its first divisions during this period. The 1st and 3rd Armored Division, and 5th, 7th, and 9th Mechanized Infantry Divisions were all formed prior to 1973. Samuel M. Katz writes that after Hafez al-Assad gained power in November 1970, the army expanded to the five divisions listed above, plus ten independent brigades, an artillery rocket brigade (the 69th), and \\"a reinforced brigade variously termed the 70th Armored Brigade or the Assad Republican Guard. It is today known as the Armored Defense Force; as Assad's praetorian guard it is stationed in and around Damascus and subordinate to the Defense Companies under the command of Assad's brother Rifa'at.\\"Samuel M. Katz, Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars, Osprey Publishing Men-at-Arms 194, 1988, 13. = 1970‚Äì2010 = On 18 September 1970, the Syrian government became involved in Black September in Jordan when it sent a reinforced armored brigade to aid the Palestine Liberation Organization. Syrian armored units crossed the border and overran Irbid with the help of local Palestinian forces. They encountered several Jordanian Army detachments, but rebuffed them without major difficulty. Two days later, the 5th Infantry Division, heavily reinforced, was also sent into Jordan. Two armored brigades were attached to the division, bringing its tank strength up to over 300 T-55s and its manpower to over 16,000. The division entered Jordan at ar-Ramtha, destroyed a company of Jordanian Centurion tanks there, and continued directly towards Amman. Pollack says it is likely that they intended to overthrow the Jordanian monarchy itself. Despite defeating the Jordanian Army at al-Ramtha on 21 September, after fierce air attacks on 22 September, the Syrians stopped the attack and began to retreat. Syrian anti-tank teams deployed French-made MILAN ATGMs during the war in Lebanon in 1982. After 1970 further Syrian engagements included: * Yom Kippur War against IsraelAn order of battle of the Syrian Army in October 1973 can be found in Colonel Trevor Dupuy, Elusive Victory: The Arab‚ÄìIsraeli Wars 1947‚Äì74, MacDonald and Jane's, London, 1978 * Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990), (against Lebanese militias, the PLO and Israel) The Syrian armed forces have also been involved in suppressing dissident movements within Syria, for example the Islamist uprising in Syria in 1979‚Äì1982. In March 1980 the 3rd Armored Division and detachments from the Defense Companies arrived in Aleppo. The division was under the command of General Shafiq Fayadh, Hafiz Assad's first cousin. The troops sealed \\"off whole quarters and carr[ied] out house-to-house searches, often preceded by tank fire.\\"Patrick Seale, Asad: The Struggle for the Middle East (London: I.B. Tauris & Co, 1988), p.327, via Holliday 2013, 12. Hundreds of suspects were rounded up. Only two conventional Army brigades deployed to Hama in 1982, the 3rd Armored Division's 47th Armored and 21st Mechanized Brigades. Three quarters of the officers and one third of the soldiers in the two brigades were Alawites.Nikolaos van Dam, The Struggle for Power in Syria: Politics and Society under Asad and the Ba'th Party, (New York: I.B. Tauris & Co Ltd, 2011), p.114, via Holliday 2013, 12. Most of the repression was carried out by the Defense Companies and the Special Forces. Meanwhile, the Special Forces were isolating and combing through Hama, killing and capturing suspected government opponents.van Dam, 2011, p.104, via Holliday 2013. Syrian forces fought Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War. In 1984, Major General Ali Haidar's Special Forces were instrumental in blocking an abortive attempt by Rifaat Assad and his Defense Companies to seize the capital. Fayadh's 3rd Armored Division moved into the capital to join Haidar's forces in the confrontation with the Defense Companies. The 3rd Armored Division, it seems, had historically been based at al-Qutayfah, near Damascus. Bennett dates the establishment of corps in the Syrian Army to 1985. Writing forty years later, Tom Cooper says they were established 'during the 1980s' but \\"..despite the establishment of.. corps.. most division commanders continued reporting directly to the President. Correspondingly, not only the Chief of Staff of the Syrian Armed Forces but also the Corps HQ exercised only a limited operational control over the Army's divisions.\\" A Syrian colonel during the First Gulf War. The 9th Armored Division served in the 1991 Persian Gulf War as the Arab Joint Forces Command North reserve and saw little action.Norman Schwarzkopf, It Doesn't Take A Hero, Bantam Books, 1993, 467‚Äì69. In 1994, Haidar expressed objections to the Syrian president's decision to bring Bashar home from his studies in Britain and groom him for the succession after the death of Basil, the eldest Assad son. Soon afterwards, on 3 September 1994, Jane's Defence Weekly reported that then-President Hafez Assad had dismissed at least 16 senior military commanders. Among them was Haidar, then commander of the Special Forces, and General Shafiq Fayadh, a cousin of the President who had commanded the \\"crack\\" 3rd Armored Division for nearly two decades. The 3rd Armored Division was \\"deployed around Damascus.\\" JDW commented that \\"the Special Forces and the 3rd Armored Division, along with the 1st Armored Division are key elements in the security structure that protects Assad's government. Any command changes involving those formations have considerable political significance.\\" Post- uprising reporting indicated the 1st Armored Division had historically been at al-Kiswah. On 29 September 2004, Jane's Defence Weekly reported that Syria had begun to redeploy elements of one or more Syrian Army special forces regiments based in the coastal hills a few kilometres south of Beirut in Lebanon. A senior Lebanese Army officer told JDW that the 3,000 troops involved would return to Syria.Nicholas Blandford, \\"Syria reduced troop strength in Lebanon,\\" Jane's Defence Weekly, 29 September 2004, 31. Cordesman wrote that in 2006 the Syrian Army had \\"organized two corps that reported to the Land Forces General Staff and the Commander of the Land Force.\\" In 2009 and 2010, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, the Syrian army comprised 220,000 regular personnel, and the entire armed forces (including the navy, air force and air defenses) had 325,000 regular troops.International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance 2010, 272‚Äì273. Additionally, it had about 290,000 reservists. In 2013, Agence France Press wrote on 'Syria's diminished security forces.' = Syrian Civil War = Syrian soldiers manning artillery during the Syrian Civil War in 2015.  Defections  At October 1, 2011, according to high-ranking defected Syrian Colonel Riad Assaad, 10,000 soldiers, including high-ranking officers, had deserted the Syrian Army. Some of these defectors had formed the Free Syrian Army, engaging in combat with security forces and soldiers in what would turn into the Syrian Civil War. At 16 November 2011, Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, however estimated that less than 1,000 soldiers had deserted the Syrian Army; at the same moment, an FSA battalion commander claimed that the FSA embraced 25,000 army deserters. Also in November 2011, the Free Syrian Army or the website of France 24 estimated the Syrian Army at 200,000 troops. According to General Mustafa al-Sheikh, one of the most senior defectors, however, in January 2012 the Syrian forces were estimated at 280,000 including conscripts. By March 15, 2012, many more soldiers, unhappy with crackdowns on pro-democracy protesters, switched sides and a Turkish official said that 60,000 soldiers had deserted the Syrian army, including 20,000 since February 20. It was added that most of the deserters were junior officers and soldiers. By 5 July 2012, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated \\"tens of thousands\\" soldiers to have defected. By August 2012, 40 Brigadier generals from the Army had defected to the opposition army, out of a total of 1,200 generals. On June 14, 2013, 73 Syrian Army officers and their families, some 202 people in total, sought refuge in Turkey. Amongst their number were seven generals and 20 colonels. By August 2013, the strength of the Syrian army had, compared with 2010, roughly been cut in half, due to defections, desertions and casualties, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London: it now counted 110,000 troops.  Strength impaired  Up until July 2012, the scale of defections from the Syrian Army, though hard to quantify, was too small to make an impact on the strength of that army, according to Aram Nerguizian from the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Strategically important units of the Syrian armed forces are always controlled by Alawite officers; defecting soldiers ‚Äì by July 2012 \\"tens of thousands\\" according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights ‚Äì are mainly Sunni without access to vital command and control, Nerguizian said, however the formed Syrian Minister of Defense General Dawoud Rajiha killed in the 18 July 2012 Damascus bombing was a Christian. Analyst Joseph Holliday wrote in 2013 that \\"the Assad government has from the beginning of the conflict been unable to mobilize all of its forces without risking largescale defections. The single greatest liability that the Assad regime has faced in employing its forces has been the challenge of relying on units to carry out orders to brutalize the opposition.\\"Holliday, 2013, 11, 12. This has resulted in Bashar's following his father's precedent by attaching regular army units to more reliable forces (Special Forces, Republican Guard, or 4th Armored Division). When Hafez al-Assad directed the suppression of revolts in Hama in 1982, this technique was also used. The Syrian Arab Army suffers from serious recruitment issues as the Syrian Civil War drags on, with military age men across sectarian lines no longer willing to join or serve their conscription terms. These issues are especially notable among the Druze population, who have clashed with regime security forces and broken Druze youths out of regime imprisonment to avoid them serving in the army. Increasingly, Assad's Alawite base of support refuse to send their sons to the military due to massive casualty rates among military age men in their community; according to pro oppositions sources a third of 250,000 Alawite men of fighting age have been killed in the Syrian Civil War, leading to major tensions between the sect and the Syrian government. As of mid-2018, then-Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that the Syrian Arab Army had regained its pre-2011 strength levels, recovering from manpower shortages earlier in the Syrian Civil War.  Roles of 3rd, 11th, 17th and 18th Divisions  The 3rd Armored Division has deployed elements of three brigades from its bases around Qutayfah to Deraa, Zabadani, and Hama, while the 11th Armored Division has stayed close to its bases in Homs and Hama.Holliday 2013, 26, citing \\"By All Means Necessary: Individual and Command Responsibility for Crimes against Humanity in Syria,\\" Human Rights Watch, December 2011, p. 36; Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Facebook page , January 24, 2012; Syrian Revolution Coordinator‚Äôs Union Facebook page , February 7, 2012; Local Coordination Committees website , November 15, 2012. The European Council named Major General Wajih Mahmud as commander of the 18th Armored Division in the Official Journal of the European Union on 15 November 2011, sanctioning him for violence committed in Homs. Henry Boyd of the IISS noted that \\"in Homs, the 18th Armored Division was reinforced by Special Forces units and ... by elements of the 4th Division under Maher's de facto command.\\" Information from Holliday 2013 suggests that the reserve armored division is the 17th (rather than any other designation), which was responsible for eastern Syria.Holliday, 2013, 42, 46, 47. Holliday's sources include \\"Skype Interview with exiled former Syrian Army General Officer in Washington, DC on April 19, 2012.\\" The division's 93rd Brigade left Idlib to secure Raqqa Governorate in early 2012.Holliday, 2013, 33, citing \\"Clashes between Syrian troops and army defectors kill at least 13,\\" Washington Post, October 13, 2011; Syrian Revolution Coordinator's Union Facebook Page , November 13, 2012. Following the reported capture of Raqqa on 3‚Äì6 March 2013, elements of the 17th Division remained under siege to the north of the city in October 2013.Alice Martins, Watching Rebels Fight Among Themselves for the City of Raqqa , SyriaDeeply.org Beta, October 2, 2013. = Relationship with National Defense Force = The National Defense Force is under the control and supervision of the Syrian Armynews24.com and acts in an infantry role, directly fighting against rebels on the ground and running counter-insurgency operations in co-ordination with the army which provides them logistical and artillery support. Struggling with reliability issues and defections, officers of the SAA increasingly prefer the part-time volunteers of the NDF, who they regard as more motivated and loyal, over regular army conscripts to conduct infantry operations and act as support for advancing tanks. An officer in Homs, who asked not to be identified, said the army was increasingly playing a logistical and directive role, while NDF fighters act as combatants on the ground. In October 2015 the 4th Assault Army Corps (Arabic: 4 ŸÅŸäŸÑŸÇ ÿßŸÇÿ™ÿ≠ÿßŸÖ) was established in the northeast. The NDF continues to play a significant role in military operations across Syria despite the formation of other elite units, many of which receive direct assistance from Russia.  Demographics  Sunni Muslims make up the majority of the Syrian Arab Army and many hold high governmental positions. From the start of the Syrian Civil War till now, the Syrian Arab Army has been composed mainly of Sunni Syrians (for example, the 4th Mechanized Division is entirely composed and led by Sunnis), with mixed religious leadership at higher military positions. the Minister of Defense and also Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army and the Armed Forces (previously Special Forces) General Major Fahd Jassem al-Freij, and Major General Mohammad al-Shaar, an Interior Minister, are some of the Sunni Muslims in the positions of power. There also operate pro-Assad Sunni militias composed of a Baathist loyalists, such as the Ba'ath Brigades. Brigades are made up of Sunni Syrians and other Arab Sunnis from the Middle Eastern region that adhere to pan-Arab ideals. Liwa al-Quds is a pro- government, Sunni Palestinian militia that operates in Aleppo.  Structure in 2001  Operation Desert Shield. The soldier is wearing a nuclear-biological- chemical warfare mask. Richard Bennett wrote in 2001 that \\"three corps [were] formed in 1985 to give the Army more flexibility and to improve combat efficiency by decentralizing the command structure, absorbing at least some of the lessons learned during the Israeli invasion of the Lebanon in 1982.\\"Richard M. Bennett, The Syrian Military: A Primer , Middle East Intelligence Bulletin, August/September 2001. The organization and military doctrine of the army followed the Soviet model.Library of Congress Country Study Syria Richard Bennett's estimate of the 2001 order of battle was: * 1st Corps HQ Damascus, which covered from Golan Heights, the fortified zone and south to Der'a near the Jordanian border.  5th Armored Division, which included the 17th and 96th Armored Brigades and the 112th Mechanized Brigade  6th Armored Division, with the 12th and 98th Armored Brigades and the 11th Mechanized Brigades  7th Mechanized Division, with the 58th and 68th Armored Brigades and the 78th Mechanized Brigade  8th Armored Division, which included the 62nd and 65th Armored Brigades and the 32nd Mechanized Brigade  9th Armored Division, with the 43rd and 91st Armored Brigades and the 52nd Mechanized Brigade. Bennett said the 1st Corps also [had] four independent special forces regiments, including two trained for heliborne commando operations against the Israeli signals intelligence & observation posts on Mount Hermon and elsewhere in the Golan Heights. * 2nd Corps (Syria) HQ Zabadani, covers north of Damascus, to Homs and includes Lebanon.  Bennett said in 2001 that the corps' principal units were believed to include:  1st Armored Division, with the 44th and 46th Armored Brigades and the 42nd Mechanized Brigade  3rd Armored Division, with the 47th and 82nd Armored Brigades and the 132nd Mechanized Brigade  11th Armored Division, with the 60th and 67th Armored Brigades and the 87th Mechanized Brigade  4th Mechanized Division with the 1st Armored Brigade and the 61st and 89th Mechanized Brigades  10th Mechanized Division, headquartered in Shtoura, Lebanon. Its main units [were in 2001] deployed to control the strategic Beirut-Damascus highway with the 123rd Mechanized Brigade near Yanta, the 51st Armored Brigade near Zahle in the Beqaa Valley and the 85th Armored Brigade, deployed around the complex of positions at Dahr al-Baidar.  three other heavy brigades from the 3rd and 11th Armored Divisions [were] known to be regularly deployed to eastern Lebanon.  there [were] five special forces regiments in the Lebanon. * 3rd Corps HQ Aleppo, based in the north and covered Hama, the Turkish and Iraqi borders, the Mediterranean coastline and was tasked with protecting the complex of chemical and biological warfare and missile production and launch facilities.  The 2nd Reserve Armored Division, with the 14th and 15th Armored Brigades and the 19th Mechanized Brigade. The 2nd [was] also believed to operate as the main armored forces training formation. It seems likely that the \\"2nd\\" designation, reported in 2001, was incorrect, as it has not been reported during the Syrian Civil War.  Other units under the control of this corps included four independent infantry brigades, one border guard brigade, one independent armored regiment, effectively a brigade group, and one special forces regiment.  the Coastal Defense Brigade, which [operated] largely as an independent unit within the 3rd Corps area, [was] headquartered in the naval base of Latakia with four Coastal Defense Battalions in Latakia, Banias, Hamidieh and Tartous. Each Battalion has four batteries of both the short range SSC-3 Styx and long range SSC-1B Sepal missile systems.

When the 4th Corps was subsequently organized in summer and fall 2015, forces of widely different origins were included: Among these were the 103rd Republican Guard Brigade which would serve as HQ for the new corps, along with troops drawn from the 3rd and 4th Divisions, as well as Ba'ath Party, NDF, and Alawite militias. The Alawite fighters were organized into 12 units which fought under the joint command of Russian, Syrian, and Iranian officers. The remained was grouped into four \\"volunteer brigades\\", while several smaller Russian units were assigned to it in a support role. Directly paid by the Republican Guard and the government, the 4th Corps was described by Carnegie Middle East Center's expert Kheder Khaddour a formation that \\"blends army and militia forces\\". Although the 4th Corps' initial operations such as during the 2015‚Äì16 Latakia offensive and Northwestern Syria offensive (October‚ÄìNovember 2015) were relatively successful, the inclusion of more militias into the corps remained elusive. This was probably due to the fact that Iran remained unwilling to allow Syrian units under its control to be integrated to a primarily Russian-led formation, while many militias generally resisted any attempts to reduce their autonomy by including them in the 4th Corps. As result, the 4th Corps remained mostly limited to Latakia, where it continues to be active. As its performance during the 2016 Latakia offensive was lacking, however, its overall commander Maj. Gen. Shuqi Yusuf was dismissed in July 2016. Overall, the 4th Corps did not \\"live up to Moscow's expectations\\" and its Syrian commanders \\"demonstrated poor performance\\", despite the fact that the corps had actually succeeded in reforming the included militias into a \\"disciplined, organized military force\\". Gregory Waters wrote via Twitter in November 2017 that '..the 6th Division [was] one of two divisions created under the Russian-built 4th Corps back in 2015. The 4th Corps project largely failed & the 6th & 2nd Divisions have remained in Latakia since.' = 5th Corps = Fifth Attack Troop Corps, also called the Fifth Legion, is an all-volunteer force, part of Syrian Army involved in the Syrian Civil War fighting against the Syrian opposition, Al- Qaeda in Syria, and ISIS. The task of the corps is \\"eliminating terrorism\\" and was formed \\"in response to the rapid development of events, to support the successes of armed forces and to meet people's wishes to put an end to terrorist acts in the Syrian Arab Republic,\\" according to the statement announced on 22 November 2016 by the General Command of the Armed Forces of Syria. The Fifth Corps of Volunteers will recruit from over age 18 from across the country \\"not already eligible for military service or deserters\\". According to Abdullah Soleiman Ali in al-Safir paper, formation of 'Fifth Attack Troop Corps' is the apex point of cooperation among members of Russia‚ÄìSyria‚ÄìIran‚ÄìIraq coalition. 5th Corps soldiers are trained, equipped and advised by Russian military personnel since their their intervention in 2015. Most main battle tanks of the 5th Assault Corps are modernized Soviet tanks, including the T-62M and T-72B3. The 5th Corps unit, The Ba'ath Legion, was formed from Ba'ath Brigades volunteers. According to the Russian International Affairs Council, the Qalamoun Shield Forces also joined the Fifth Corps, though no other sources confirmed this. In February 2018, 20 members of the ISIS Hunters (a 5th Corps subunit) died in a US airstrike.

Each uniform has two coats: a long one for dress and a short jacket for informal wear. Army officer uniforms are khaki in summer, olive in winter. Certain Army (paratroops and special forces) and Air Defense Force personnel may wear camouflage uniforms. Among the camouflage are Red Lizard, and Syrian Leaf pattern; a locally-made copy of the ERDL. Officers have a variety of headgear, including a service cap, garrison cap, and beret (linen in summer and wool in winter). The color of the beret varies according to the officer's unit. The most common beret color is black, for infantry, Engineering, Signals and supporting arms personnel, followed by Green, for Armored, Mechanized and Artillery personnel, Red for the Republican Guard and Military Police, and Maroon for the Special Forces. In 2011, the standard issue combat helmets were the olive Chinese QGF-02, and the Soviet SSh-68 for the reserve forces. Both of them can be equipped with the \\"Syrian Leaf\\" camouflage helmet covers. The Republican Guard and Special Forces were the only units equipped with TAT-BA-7 bullet-proof vests. With the late 2015 arrival of Russian military advisors, many army units were equipped with new Russian 6B45 ballistic bullet-proof vests and Kevlar 6B7 helmets. = Ranks = Commissioned officers' rank insignia are identical for the army and air force. These are gold on a bright green or black shoulder board for the army and gold on a bright blue board for the air force. Officer ranks are standard, although the highest is the equivalent of Colonel General, a rank held in 1986 only by the commander in chief and the minister of defense. Navy officer rank insignia are gold stripes worn on the lower sleeve. The highest-ranking officer in Syria's navy is the equivalent of lieutenant general. Army and air force rank for warrant officers is indicated by gold stars on an olive green shield worn on the upper left arm. Lower noncommissioned ranks are indicated by upright and inverted chevrons worn on the upper left arm. = Awards = Although some twenty-five orders and medals are authorized, generally only senior officers and warrant officers wear medal ribbons. The following are some important Syrian awards: Order of Umayyad, Medal of Military Honor, the War Medal, Medal for Courage, Yarmuk Medal, Wounded in Action Medal, and Medal of March 8, 1963.

He was expelled from the New York State Assembly in 1920 during the First Red Scare.  Background  Louis Waldman was born on January 5, 1891, in Yancherudnia, Ukraine, not far from Kiev, the son of a Jewish innkeeper who was one of the few literate men of the village. Waldman emigrated to America in the summer 1909 at the age of 17, arriving in New York City to join his sisters on September 17.Louis Waldman, Labor Lawyer. New York: E.P. Dutton & Co., 1944; pp. 11, 19-21. Waldman first worked in a metal shop before becoming an apprentice garment lining cutter in one of the sweatshops of the city. He joined a union and participated in the 11-week New York cloakmakers' strike of 1910, while attending high school in the evenings.Waldman, Labor Lawyer, pg. 28. Upon conclusion of the strike and resumption of his job, Waldman was fired and blacklisted for carrying out his function as a union representative in supervising the enforcement of the union contract in his shop.Waldman, Labor Lawyer, pp. 30-31. Barred from the garment industry, Waldman thereafter worked unsuccessfully as a door-to-door peddler of ribbon before taking a job in a cardboard box factory. Waldman graduated from high school in the spring of 1911 and, owing to a lack of funds for college, enrolled in the Cooper Union to study engineering that fall.Waldman, Labor Lawyer, pp. 31-32. Waldman was a shocked member of the crowd on the street that witnessed the catastrophic Triangle Waist Company fire of 1911, an event which clearly always remained with him and served as one of the landmarks of his life. Waldman described the grim scene in his 1944 memoirs: Packed into a tight space and locked away from means of escape, 146 workers from the building's 9th floor died that day in one of the greatest tragedies in New York City's history. At a memorial meeting held at Cooper Union in the aftermath of the fire, Waldman saw and heard Socialist leader Morris Hillquit speak for the first time, an event which inspired Waldman to engage in \\"a veritable orgy of reading\\" on socialism and thereby won the young man over to the socialist cause.Waldman, Labor Lawyer, pg. 39. Waldman graduated from Cooper Union in June 1916 with a degree in engineering, and worked as a construction engineer during the day while following his ambition to become a lawyer by attending law school in the evenings.Waldman, Labor Lawyer, pp. 40-41. Career =Labor lawyer= He was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1923 and worked thereafter as counsel for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, for the New York Central Trades and Labor Council, and for various other unions in the building and garment trades.Louis Waldman, The Good Fight: A Quest for Social Progress. Philadelphia: Dorrance & Co., 1975; pg. 204. =Politician= Socialist in New York Assembly In 1916 the young engineer Louis Waldman was approached at a meeting of his Socialist Party branch and was drafted into becoming a candidate of the party for the New York State Assembly. Although he protested that between his engineering job and his evening studies of law he had no time for campaigning, the party official approaching him smiled and replied, \\"Campaigning? Who said anything about campaigning? We just want someone to run for office. If you get more than seven hundred votes we'll be lucky. The real campaigns this year will be for Meyer London and Morris Hillquit.\\"Waldman, Labor Lawyer, pg. 42. And thus was born a Socialist Party politician. Waldman did actually campaign, however, mounting the platform to give public speeches, at which he gradually improved. Waldman performed well in the 1916 election, tripling the Socialist tally while losing to his Democratic opponent by a few hundred votes.Waldman, Labor Lawyer, pp. 45-46. In the fall of 1917, with America embroiled in the European conflict and a section of the American electorate radicalized by the turn towards war by the Democratic administration of Woodrow Wilson, Waldman ran for the Assembly again as a Socialist, this time winning election. Waldman was a member of the State Assembly (New York Co., 8th D.), sitting in the 141st New York State Legislature, one of 10 Socialists elected to the Assembly of 1918, the best electoral performance that the organization would ever achieve. In November 1918, Waldman met with defeat, but he ran again for state assembly in 1919 against a fusion candidate of the Democratic and Republican parties and emerged victorious, along with four other Socialist Party comrades, August Claessens, Samuel Orr, Charles Solomon, and Samuel A. DeWitt. The five Socialist Assemblymen were suspended on the first day of the new legislative session by the Republican-dominated body and their expulsion trial before the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly and subsequent court fight became a cause celebre of the Red Scare. They were expelled on April 1. All five were re- elected at a special election on September 16, and appeared to take their seats at the beginning of the special session on September 20. The next day, DeWitt and Orr were permitted to take their seats, but Claessens, Solomon and Waldman were expelled again. Protesting against the re-expulsion of their comrades, DeWitt and Orr resigned their seats. In 1924, he ran on the Socialist ticket for New York Attorney General. Waldman was elected chairman of the Socialist Party of New York state in 1928, a position which he retained through the first half of the 1930s. He also stood as the SP candidate for Governor of New York in 1928, 1930 and 1932, polling over 100,000 votes in each of these races. Along with Morris Hillquit, James Oneal, and Algernon Lee, Waldman was recognized as a leader of the SP's \\"Old Guard\\" faction, which favored close working relations with the trade unions of the American Federation of Labor and pursuance of gradual ameliorative reforms leading eventually to socialism rather than cataclysmic revolutionary transformation. This perspective brought Waldman and the Old Guard into opposition of the largely youth based \\"Militant\\" faction in the party, who favored reconciliation with the Communist Party USA, in keeping with the United Front policy of the Comintern and preparation for a socialist struggle for power in the event of capitalism's collapse. Factional leader in 1930s During the first half of the 1930s, Waldman was one of the leading figures of the so- called \\"Old Guard\\" of the Socialist Party ‚Äî an organized faction based in New York City which sought to continue the party's traditional orientation towards electoral politics and close cooperation with the trade union movement. The Old Guard organized itself in opposition to a so-called \\"Militant faction\\" which emerged in 1930 and 1931, consisting of younger and more radical members who sought a turn towards direct action and a program endorsing revolutionary socialism. Although both of these main factions considered themselves orthodox Marxists, the social democratic Old Guard considered their Militant opponents to be adventurists with a deluded sense of enthusiasm for the Soviet Union and the world communist movement, while the Militants considered the Old Guard to be dyed-in-the-wood reformists unwilling to challenge anti-democratic behavior in the union movement. Personal and personnel issues entered into play. The Militants sought to replace Socialist Party National Chairman Morris Hillquit, the best known and most widely respected of the Old Guard leaders, as an impediment to the future growth of the party. The Old Guard, similarly, sought the removal of the party's National Executive Secretary, Clarence Senior, a prot√©g√© of the charismatic spokesman for the radical wing of the party, former Presidential candidate Norman Thomas, an outspoken pacifist who had made common cause with the organized Militant group in an effort to build the SPA into a mass movement. The critical moment in the struggle between the two main factions came in June 1934 at the Socialist Party's National Convention in Detroit, Michigan. There the assembled delegates took up debate of an aggressively anti-militarist Declaration of Principles for the party, written by Thomas ally Devere Allen. Louis Waldman was one of the key spokesmen for the Old Guard in the debate over this document at the Detroit Convention. Waldman took issue with the clause of the proposed Declaration of Principles which called for \\"massed war resistance\\" by the party in the face of a new war\\": Following the conclusion of debate, the Declaration of Principles was approved by majority vote of the assembled delegates and the matter referred to the membership of the party for ratification by referendum vote. The Old Guard minority issued a formal statement on the matter, calling the Declaration of Principles \\"inadequate and confused\\" and a step towards turning the SPA into an \\"underground organization.\\" The Old Guard statement continued: > Existing democracy, incomplete though it be, is immensely valuable to the > workers, through whose struggles it has been won. Let communists and > fascists call it 'bogus.' Our duty is to defend and perfect it. > > The pledge to support any 'comrade' coming into conflict with the law by > any anti-war activity invites fanatics and provocators (sic.) to join the > party and involve it in responsibility for acts inconsistent with socialist > principles. It is also an incitement to unlawful acts. Such incitement is > itself a crime, for which courts could hold every party member > liable.\\"Statement for the Minority in Opposition to the Declaration of > Principles,\\" American Socialist Quarterly, vol. 3, special supplement (July > 1934), pg. 59. The membership of the party was encouraged to defeat proposed new Declaration of Principles in favor of retention of the existing 1924 Declaration. The 1934 Declaration of Principles was ratified by the party membership nonetheless. The factional war within the Socialist Party continued unabated for more than a year more, with the Old Guard faction ultimately exiting the party en masse to form the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) at the time of the party's May 1936 convention in Cleveland.  Social Democratic Federation  Louis Waldman as he appeared at the time of publication of his first memoir in 1944. Waldman continued to play a leading role in the new SDF organization. An organizational meeting was held of the new group in early July, at which Waldman sought to endorse Franklin Delano Roosevelt for President of the United States in lieu of the Socialist nominee, Norman Thomas. The gathering found itself split on the issue, however, and no endorsement was forthcoming.\\"SDF Splits on FDR Okay,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. 2, whole no. 69 (July 11, 1936), pg. 2. Waldman's foes, such as New York Socialist Party Executive Secretary Jack Altman and Socialist candidate for Governor Harry W. Laidler were quick to attack Waldman, charging him with a \\"betrayal of Socialist principles\\" in attempting to \\"divert 100,000 Socialist votes to the Roosevelt column.\\" Many SDF members became involved in the American Labor Party when it was formed in 1936, supporting the faction led by David Dubinsky. Waldman however resigned from the ALP in 1940, feeling it had been taken over by a pro-Communist faction led by Sidney Hillman. It was not for another four years until Dubinsky and his supporters reached the same conclusion and bolted to form the Liberal Party. After resigning from the ALP, Waldman had virtually no political involvements and devoted himself to his law practice, becoming one of the most distinguished labor lawyers in the nation. During this period, he represented Walter Krivitsky among others.Waldman, Labor Lawyer, pp. 335-366. He was also active in the New York State Bar Association and served over the years on numerous state commissions. Representing unions as varied as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the International Longshoremen's Association, Waldman continued his practice until retiring due to a stroke in his late 80s. =Perspective of Civil Rights Movement= Like many liberals of his time, Waldman expressed sympathy for the endeavors of civil rights activists but did not agree with their tactic of breaking the law. In an article published by the New York State Bar Journal in 1965, he expressed his worries. He begins by assuring his readers that he \\"espoused and still [espouses] the cause of civil rights for all people\\" and then argues:Garrow, David J.

In such a way, Waldman asserted: defying the law is on its face generally a bad thing because defiance would weaken respect for the law in most cases, especially if the legal system is basically decent; therefore, in order to meet this objection, those who advocated civil disobedience must have legitimate justifications to defy the law. Answering Waldman's objections, King often used such a particular argument: the evils being opposed were so serious, so numerous, and so difficult to fight that civil disobedience was a justifiable last resort. Although the means were regrettable, the end justified the means. Personal life and death  Louis Waldman married Bella B. Waldman, with whom he had two sons. He retired age 86 after a severe stroke. He died on September 12, 1982 at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan, New York City. His papers reside at the New York Public Library. Legacy =Law firm= The law firm he helped found, later Vladeck, Waldman, Elias, and Engelhardt, currently Vladeck, Raskin & Clark, continues to exist in New York. Works In 1944, Louis Waldman published his first autobiography, Labor Lawyer, in which he laid out his defense of the positions he had taken in his political career. Among other things, Waldman became very critical of the New Deal, considering it to be overly accommodating to the Communists and exhibiting certain authoritarian tendencies, somewhat echoing the critique of the old right. He was particularly alarmed by the integration of trade unions into the state apparatus that began to occur during World War II. Labor Lawyer also represents an important primary source for the history of the Socialist Party in the years following the death of Eugene Victor Debs. It is worthy of note that many of the figures he denounces as dangerous pro-Communists in his book, such as Reinhold Niebuhr and Andrew Biemiller, would later become pillars of anti-Communist liberals of the postwar years. While Waldman himself was mostly apolitical after the war, this perspective clearly informed younger Old Guard supporters such as Morrie Ryskind and Ralph de Toledano who moved to the right from the anti-Communist left. TIME (possibly Whittaker Chambers) reviewed the book, saying: > Waldman's experiences in the years that followed were part of the tumultuous > coming of age of U.S. social consciousness... Labor Lawyer, Waldman's > autobiography, is an esoteric jumble... Above all, it is an old Socialist's > insistent, desperate warning against Communism as the No. 1 despoiler of the > democratic ideal... Waldman believes that the strength of Communism in the > U.S. is now reaching a new peak in the C.I.O.'s Political Action Committee > (TIME, July 24, 1944), \\"the catch-all for the political activities of unions > dominated by Communists, militant Socialists and others willing to cooperate > with them.\\" He concludes flatly: \\"Unless the New Deal casts out the seeds of > left-wing totalitarianism, which it fosters today, it may either lead to an > American variety of Communism, or, what is more likely, provoke an American > expression of unadorned fascism.\\" Waldman published a second memoir, The Good Fight, in 1975.

History  The agency was created 1933 with the merger of the Kolhapur Agency (Kolhapur Residency), Poona Agency, Bijapur Agency, Dharwar Agency and Kolaba Agency. It was composed of a number of princely states and jagirs in Western India, located in the present-day Indian states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, six of which were Salute states. The princely states included in the agency were under the suzerainty, but not the control, of the British authorities of the Bombay Presidency. After Indian Independence in 1947, the states all acceded to the Dominion of India, and were integrated into the Indian state of Bombay. In 1956 the Kannada language speaking southern portion of Bombay state, which included the former states of the Southern Maratha Country, was transferred to Mysore State (later renamed Karnataka).

The words were written by Dr. John F. Holmes and music composed by Maurice Hoffmann in 1926. In \\"Old New Hampshire\\" was chosen to be the \\"official\\" state song first in 1949, then again in November 1977, by the State Song Selection Board. New Hampshire has eight \\"honorary\\" state songs and no other official songs. History In 1926, Dr. John F. Holmes of Manchester wrote the song's lyrics. Maurice Hoffman, Jr., the Franklin Street Congregational Church organist of Manchester, wrote the music. The 1941 General Court voted against making it the state song, and the 1943 General Court killed a bill public contest with cash prizes, to pick a state song. In 1949, the General Court voted in favor of designating \\"Old New Hampshire\\" as the state song. In 1963, the legislature approved \\"New Hampshire, My New Hampshire\\", by Julius Richelson and Walter P. Smith of Plymouth, as the \\"Second State Song\\". The \\"Third State Song\\", designated by the legislature in 1973, was \\"New Hampshire Hills\\", with music by Tom Powers of Detroit, Michigan, son of retired Director Edward Powers of the State Sweepstakes Commission, and the late Paul Scott Mowrer, state poet laureate. In March 1977, \\"Autumn in New Hampshire,\\" by Leo Austin of Warner, was added as the \\"Fourth State Song\\". The addition of this song coincided with the creation of an interim board to recommend one \\"official\\" state song and designate the remainder of songs as \\"honorary\\". In June 1977, another song law was enacted by the General Court which added four more songs to the listing of state songs, with a stipulation that if none were chosen by the Board as the official state song, they would become \\"honorary\\" state songs. The four songs were: \\"New Hampshire's Granite State\\" by Annie B. Currier of Londonderry; \\"Oh, New Hampshire (You're My Home)\\" by Brownie Macintosh of Hampton; \\"The Old Man of the Mountain\\" by Paul Belanger of Berlin, and \\"The New Hampshire State March\\" by Rene Richards of Nashua. The State Song Selection Board consisted of Rep. Richardson D. Benton of Chester, who was the Board's coordinator; William E. Elwell of Portsmouth, who became chairman, Ted Hebert and Robert F. Thibeault of Manchester, who were all named by the Governor of New Hampshire and Council; Senator Robert F. Bossie of Manchester, named by the Senate President; and Rep. Jane F. Sanders of Alton Bay, named by the House Speaker. On November 29, 1977, the announcement of the name of the official song was made in Representatives Hall. New Hampshire First Lady Gale Thomson, wife of Governor Meldrim Thomson, Jr., drew the choice from a sealed envelope in which the name had been placed by the Board. In 1983, \\"New Hampshire Naturally,\\" with words and music by Rick and Ron Shaw, was added to the list of state songs listed in RSA 3:7. Lyrics :With a skill that knows no measure, :From the golden store of Fate :God, in His great love and wisdom, :Made the rugged Granite State; :Made the lakes, the fields, the forests; :Made the Rivers and the rills; :Made the bubbling, crystal fountains :Of New Hampshire's Granite Hills ::Refrain ::Old New Hampshire, Old New Hampshire ::Old New Hampshire Grand and Great ::We will sing of Old New Hampshire, ::Of the dear old Granite State :Builded he New Hampshire glorious :From the borders to the sea; :And with matchless charm and splendor :Blessed her for eternity. :Hers, the majesty of mountain; :Hers, the grandeur of the lake; :Hers, the truth as from the hillside :Whence her crystal waters break ::Refrain Honorary state songs * \\"New Hampshire, my New Hampshire\\" with words by Julius Richelson and music by Walter P.

The station broadcasts a classic country music & news format. The station can be most reliably heard within the boundaries of Grey County, Bruce County, Huron County, northern Perth County and northern Wellington County. However, it can be heard acceptably without much interference as far as Elora on a good radio receiver. CKNX has been playing a country music format for a major part of its history.  History  = Launch = CKNX AM broadcast area map. The station was originally launched in 1926 as an informal broadcasting experiment by local businessman W. T. Cruickshank, who aired live and unscripted programming provided by customers of his repair shop. In its original incarnation, the station was simply known as Joke, but proved so popular that Cruickshank applied for an amateur broadcasting license and the station formally became 10BP by 1930. In 1935, the station was officially licensed as commercial radio station CKNX, on 1200 AM. CKNX was affiliated with CBC Radio's Dominion Network until 1962. = Frequency move = The station briefly moved to the 1230 frequency in 1941, and to its current 920 frequency a few months later. In the late 1940s and 1950s, the station's Saturday Night Barn Dance was one of the most popular and influential radio programs in Ontario.  CKNX-TV  In 1955, CKNX-TV was also launched. On March 8, 1962, the building which accommodated the CKNX radio and television stations caught fire. Although nothing could be salvaged, CKNX was back on the air within a few hours, broadcasting from temporary facilities at the transmitter site and using the nearby high school gym as a TV studio. CKNX operations continued as such (with various temporary offices set up in Wingham) until they purchased new equipment and moved into a new building in 1963.  Acquisition  The stations were acquired in 1971 by Blackburn Radio, who also launched CKNX-FM in 1977. Blackburn sold the television station to Baton Broadcasting in 1993, but retains ownership of the radio stations to this day. Blackburn also launched a second FM station in Wingham, CIBU, in 2005.

Within Philadelphia, PA 611 follows Broad Street, the main north-south street in Philadelphia, through most of the city. The route continues north through the northern suburbs of Philadelphia and serves Jenkintown, Willow Grove, and Doylestown, the latter of which it bypasses on a freeway. North of Doylestown, PA 611 heads through rural areas and runs along the west bank of the Delaware River to the city of Easton in the Lehigh Valley. The route continues back into rural land and passes through the Delaware Water Gap, at which point it enters the Pocono Mountains region. Here, PA 611 heads northwest through Stroudsburg and Mount Pocono toward its northern terminus. The current alignment of PA 611 is composed of several turnpikes that were built in the 1800s. What is now PA 611 was designated as part of U.S. Route 611 (US 611) in 1926, a U.S. highway that ran from Philadelphia City Hall in Philadelphia north to US 11 in Scranton. US 611 was designated along part of the Lackawanna Trail, which carried the PA 2 designation between 1924 and 1928. The northern terminus of the route in the Scranton area has shifted multiple times. US 611 experienced two realignments in the 1930s along the section of the route between Easton and Stroudsburg. In 1953, US 611 was moved to a new alignment between Portland and Delaware Water Gap that crossed the Delaware River twice and ran through a section of New Jersey, with the former alignment becoming US 611 Alternate (US 611 Alt.). The alignment of the route in New Jersey and across the Delaware Water Gap back into Pennsylvania became part of I-80; US 611 was shifted back to its Pennsylvania alignment in 1965, replacing US 611 Alt. US 611 was decommissioned in 1972 and the route was replaced with PA 611 between Philadelphia City Hall in Philadelphia and I-81E (now I-380) in Tobyhanna and PA 435 between I-81E in Gouldsboro and I-81E in Dunmore.

History What is now PA 611 between Philadelphia and Willow Grove was originally built as part of the Old York Road, a road established in the 18th century to connect Philadelphia to New York City. This portion of the road was planned in 1711 to run from Philadelphia to Centre Bridge. The Old York Road would later exist as a turnpike. In 1811, the Philadelphia and Great Bend Turnpike, a private turnpike, was chartered to run between Philadelphia and Great Bend. This turnpike was built to attract settlers to rural Pennsylvania. The section through Covington Township was built as a plank road between 1819 and 1826 by John Delong under the employment of Henry Drinker. The Philadelphia and Great Bend Turnpike, which was also known as the Drinker Turnpike, was built from 1826 to 1828. In 1823, the Willow Grove and Doylestown Turnpike Company was chartered to build a turnpike between Willow Grove and Doylestown. The turnpike between Willow Grove and Doylestown was completed in the 1830s. The Easton Road between Doylestown and Plumsteadville was improved into a turnpike in the 1840s. US 611 sign at the intersection of Cheltenham Avenue and Old York Road (PA 611) on the border of Philadelphia and Cheltenham Following the passage of the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, the route between Philadelphia and Scranton was designated as Legislative Route 151 between Philadelphia and Doylestown, Legislative Route 156 between Doylestown and Easton, Legislative Route 165 between Easton and Bangor, Legislative Route 166 between Bangor and Stroudsburg, and Legislative Route 168 between Stroudsburg and Scranton. In 1921, the Lackawanna Trail was built as a paved auto trail running from Easton north through Stroudsburg to Scranton and the New York border. After being constructed, the trail was one of the best paved roads in the eastern part of the United States. The road between Philadelphia and Scranton was designated by the state in 1924 as part of the Lackawanna Trail, which continued north past Scranton to the New York state line in Great Bend. The Lackawanna Trail was designated as PA 2. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 611 was designated concurrent with PA 2 along the Lackawanna Trail between Philadelphia City Hall in Philadelphia and parent route US 11 in Scranton. At this time, the entire length of US 611 was paved. In 1928, the concurrent PA 2 designation was removed from US 611. The same year, PA 191 was designated onto Broad Street in Philadelphia between Moyamensing Avenue and Philadelphia City Hall. In 1928, PA 827 was designated onto the portion of Delaware Drive between US 611 in Martins Creek and Martins Creek Belvidere Highway; this road was paved. In addition, the section of Delaware Drive between east of Martins Creek and Mount Bethel was an unnumbered paved road. In 1928, PA 612 was designated onto unpaved Foxtown Hill Road between US 611 in Delaware Water Gap and south of Stroudsburg while PA 302 was designated onto paved Park Avenue between PA 612 and US 611 in Stroudsburg. By 1930, the portion of PA 612 along Foxtown Hill Road was paved while the PA 302 designation was removed. The northern end of US 611 was routed by 1930 to follow Drinker Street and Blakely Street in Dunmore to end at US 11 at Green Ridge Steeet, with US 11 having replaced US 611 along Green Ridge Street to Main Avenue in Scranton. Old junction US 611 sign on Easton Road in Willow Grove in 2008. The US 611 shield became missing from the sign and has been replaced with a PA 611 shield. In the 1930s, US 611 was realigned to follow Delaware Drive between Martins Creek and Portland, replacing the entire length of PA 827. The former alignment of the route between Martins Creek and Mount Bethel via Bangor was designated as PA 712; this road is now unnumbered Main Street and Lower South Main Street between Martins Creek and Bangor and PA 512 between Bangor and Mount Bethel. US 611 and PA 612 switched alignments between Delaware Water Gap and Stroudsburg in the 1930s, with US 611 realigned to follow Foxtown Hill Road and Park Avenue between Delaware Water Gap and Stroudsburg and PA 612 designated to follow the former alignment of US 611 between Delaware Water Gap and Stroudsburg via East Stroudsburg along Broad Street, Brown Street, Prospect Street, Ridgeway Street, Bridge Street, and Main Street. By 1940, US 611 was extended north along US 11 to follow Green Ridge Street, Main Avenue, and Market Street to end at US 6 at Keyser Avenue in Scranton. In the 1930s, US 611 was widened into a multilane road across the Neshaminy Creek, between south of Doylestown and Plumsteadville, between US 46 in Portland and Slateford, between Delaware Water Gap and south of Stroudsburg, from a point north of the PA 507 intersection north to the newly constructed PA 307 in southern Lackawanna County, and between south of Dunmore and Scranton. During the 1940s, US 611 was upgraded to a multilane road between Philadelphia and south of Doylestown, between south of Stroudsburg and north of the PA 507 intersection, and along a short stretch to the north of PA 348 in Lackawanna County. By 1950, US 611 was realigned to bypass Pipersville to the west, with the former alignment becoming Old Easton Road. By this time, the route was also shifted west to a new alignment between north of PA 113 and north of Ottsville, with the former alignment becoming Durham Road. US 611 was extended further north along US 11 to end at US 6 at the northern edge of Scranton in the 1950s. In the 1950s, PA 291 replaced the PA 191 designation along Broad Street between Moyamensing Avenue and US 611 at Philadelphia City Hall. In the 1950s, US 611 was upgraded to a divided highway between Philadelphia and PA 63 in Willow Grove, between Scotrun and PA 196 in Mount Pocono, and along a short stretch south of PA 490 in Tobyhanna. The section of US 611 between PA 590 in Elmhurst and Dunmore was improved to a divided highway in 1958, with the section of the route leading into Dunmore moved to a new alignment. In 1953, US 611 was realigned between Portland and Delaware Water Gap to cross the Delaware River on the Portland- Columbia Toll Bridge into New Jersey, where it continued along a new multilane road on the east bank of the Delaware River before crossing back into Pennsylvania on the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. The former alignment of the route in Pennsylvania between Portland and Delaware Water Gap was designated as US 611 Alt. By 1960, the alignment of US 611 across the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge became part of I-80. In 1963, the Pennsylvania Highways Department recommended replacing US 611 Alt. with US 611, with the US 611 designation to be removed from I-80. On March 25, 1965, approval was given to realign US 611 to follow the alignment of US 611 Alt. as opposed to crossing the Delaware River twice and running through New Jersey; signs were to be changed by April 1 of that year. US 611 was upgraded to a divided highway between County Line Road north of Horsham and Doylestown in the 1960s. The section of US 611 between Tobyhanna and Gouldsboro was upgraded to a freeway and became part of I-81E (now I-380) in the 1960s. In addition, US 611 was rerouted to follow a section of the I-81E freeway in Dunmore to end at an interchange with I-81. Button copy guide sign with former US 611 designation at the south end of Doylestown Bypass in 2009. This sign has since been replaced. On December 3, 1971, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the elimination of the US 611 designation. On March 14, 1972, US 611 was decommissioned and replaced with PA 611 between Philadelphia and I-81E in Tobyhanna and PA 435 between I-81E in Gouldsboro and I-81E in Dunmore. Signs were changed by April of that year. The southern terminus of PA 611 was located at PA 3 and PA 291 at Philadelphia City Hall. By 1989, PA 611 was extended south along Broad Street from Philadelphia City Hall to I-95, replacing PA 291 between Moyamensing Avenue and Philadelphia City Hall. In the 1950s and 1960s, plans were made for a freeway along the US 611 corridor between Philadelphia and Easton. The proposal called for extending PA 63 (Woodhaven Road) from Northeast Philadelphia northwest to an interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) in Southampton. From here, the freeway would become the Cross County Expressway and parallel US 611, utilizing the present- day Doylestown Bypass and continuing north to the south end of the PA 33 freeway near Easton. Most of this proposed freeway was not built. In 1970, the state awarded contracts to build a bypass for US 611 around Doylestown. The freeway bypass for PA 611 around Doylestown opened in 1976, removing the route from its former alignment that ran through Doylestown on Main Street. By 1989, PA 611 was upgraded to a divided highway between the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) interchange in Willow Grove and PA 463 in Horsham. Major intersections Special routes =Bucks County truck route= Pennsylvania Route 611 Truck (PA 611 Truck) signs are posted to direct motorists from northbound PA 413 directly to PA 611 in Bedminster Township in Bucks County, avoiding Old Easton Road. =Former Monroe County truck route= Pennsylvania Route 611 Truck (PA 611 Truck) was a truck route of PA 611 that bypassed the stretch of the route between Bartonsville and Tannersville in Monroe County from 2013 to 2015. PA 611 Truck northbound started at the intersection of PA 33 and PA 611. When PA 33 interchanges with I-80, the truck route headed onto I-80 west. In Tannersville, it reached an interchange with PA 715 at exit 299 and a mile later, PA 611 Truck left I-80 at exit 298 to PA 611, reaching its northern terminus. PA 611 Truck southbound started at PA 611 and merged onto I-80 east at exit 298. It had an interchange with PA 715 at exit 299 and 3 miles later, exited I-80 onto PA 33 north. PA 611 Truck reached its southern terminus 0.13 miles later at PA 611. However, the truck route was decommissioned in 2015. =Former Philadelphia alternate route= U.S. Route 611 Alternate (US 611 Alt.) was an alternate alignment of US 611 between Philadelphia and Willow Grove. The route began at US 309, US 422, and US 309 Truck at the intersection of Germantown Avenue, Chew Avenue, and Mt. Airy Avenue in Philadelphia, heading northeast on Mt. Airy Avenue. The route became Easton Road as it entered Montgomery County, where it formed a short concurrency with PA 152 before intersecting PA 73. US 611 Alt. continued through Glenside and Roslyn before it reached Willow Grove, where it crossed PA 63 before ending at US 611 near the southern terminus of PA 263. US 611 Alt. was first designated by 1946. The alternate route was decommissioned in the 1950s. ;Major intersections =Former Delaware Water Gap alternate route= U.S. Route 611 Alternate (US 611 Alt.) was an alternate alignment of US 611 that ran between Portland and Stroudsburg across the Delaware Water Gap. US 611 Alt. began at Portland in Northampton County, where US 611 crossed the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge into New Jersey. From here, it headed north on the west bank of the Delaware River, passing through Slateford. The route traversed the Delaware Water Gap into Monroe County and continued to the community of Delaware Water Gap. Here, US 611 Alt. reached its northern terminus at an intersection with US 611 at Foxtown Hill Road. US 611 Alt. was designated during the 1950s on the former alignment of US 611 when US 611 was realigned to use a new alignment across the river in New Jersey, crossing the Delaware River twice on the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. In 1963, the Pennsylvania Highways Department recommended replacing US 611 Alt. with US 611, with the US 611 designation to be removed from I-80. US 611 Alt. was replaced by US 611 in 1965 when it was rerouted out of New Jersey. I-80 had replaced the alignment of US 611 in New Jersey. ;Major intersections See also  References External links *PA 611 Junction List *Endpoints of historic U.S. Highway 611 611 Category:Limited-access roads in Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Philadelphia Category:Transportation in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Bucks County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Northampton County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Monroe County, Pennsylvania 6 Category:Streets in Philadelphia ","title":"Pennsylvania Route 611"},{"id":"3424089","text":"Greenfield is a small village about from the town of Flitwick in Bedfordshire, England. It lies across Flitwick Moor from the larger settlement of Flitwick and is on the opposite side of the River Flit. It forms part of the parish of Flitton and Greenfield. The main street (High Street) has junctions with Pulloxhill road, leading to the village of Pulloxhill, School Lane, the site of the old village school. High Street also has a junction with Mill Lane, which was until the 1960s a cart route to Ruxox Farm, Maulden and Ampthill and now leads to footpaths and bridleways to Maggot Moor, Flitwick Moor, Ruxox Farm, Flitton Moor, and the village of Flitton. Houses along High Street are a mix of thatched cottages and Bedfordshire brick dwellings, with an assortment of renovated or rebuilt barn buildings in keeping to some extent with earlier farm courtyard structures. Due to closures, there is now only one public house in Greenfield called The Compasses. Three former pubs, were the Swan Beerhouse on Mill Lane which closed in 1909, the Nags Head Beerhouse on the High Street which closed in 1913, and the Old Bell Public House which closed more recently in 2007. There was also once a post office and store on Mill Lane, and the village store on the High Street (formerly Cockroft's), and a village school on School Lane that was later used as an artists studio by artist and sculptor James Butler. The former beer houses and stores are now private residences. A new village school was built on Pulloxhill road during the 1960s. History The original agrarian folk community has had a long known history stretching back to the pre-Roman times. Evidence of an ancient settlement has been found on the adjacent woodland mire area of Flitwick Moor. Artifacts can be found in fields and ditches in Greenfield, mainly of flint scrapers and arrowheads from the mesolithic era, and even into the neolithic era and Iron Age due to the useful durable nature of the local flint. Ancient Briton relics respecting the Celtic god of thunder, such as a Wheel of Taranis, have been found at the Ruxox site, which in the 1220s became the Ruxox Cell of Dunstable Priory. Roman artefacts such as tiles, fragments of pots have and an altar to the cult of Bacchus have also been found locally at Ruxox (Hutchison 1986). During the last decade of the 18th century, field enclosure was introduced, quite late on in history, and riots were instigated by local tenants who gathered to protest as their livelihood was under threat. Further threat to the local folk way of life would also come from the relatively late introduction of Protestant Christian thought in the area. Greenfield was expanded in the 19th century as a Methodist settlement alongside the Church of England settlement at Flitton. Temperance meetings were introduced and organised by newcomer nobility from Wrest Park, which led to the demise of two key local beerhouses that served the traditional folk community at the time. During Victorian times, the local Lady Cowper visited Greenfield from Wrest Park, and described Greenfield as \\"an 'End'- 'a long straggly, fenny place with poor housing and rough people. Many were originally squatters and built makeshift houses\\". There was significant hardship at this time with some families taking bread from charity. There were still \\"Poor Rights\\" for the locals which allowed them to cut peat from the Moors for drying and burning. There were ten shareholders of Flitton Moor who paid 15 shillings a share and Greenfield Moor divided into 6 portions at 12 shillings each. The local primary school (once located on School Lane) was built during the time of Church of England school development era to improve literacy and \\"elevate the local populace\\" from superstitious beliefs. This is now a private residence and the primary school was moved to Pulloxhill road during the late 1960s. Regarding health care during the Victorian times, cottagers had to pay between 1 shilling and 10 shillings a year depending on the treatment, and the very poor who could not afford the fee would have to rely on local folk treatments and cures. The area was once well known as a strawberry-producing area, and the fields were full of strawberry plants on either side of the main road. Carts would take the strawberries to Luton until the 1920s when a blight and a series of rook infestations destroyed the crop. Greenfield Mill, 1900 Mill Lane was named after the watermill that ground wheat and barley corn until the 1950s and was located at the bottom of the lane. The mill was fed by a millpond, now a stream at the west side of the lane, and the outflow ran downhill into a ford that filled up when the mill was grinding corn. When grinding stopped, the river was diverted using sluice gates around the back of the mill. The mill photographed was built in the mid 19th century, although the records of Dunstable Priory indicate that there has been a mill on the site since at least year 1200 that served Ruxox Augustinian Ruxox Cell and local community. After a series of local disputes, Greenfield Mill was unused and became derelict from 1959 to 1970 when it was demolished to make way for houses. The bridleway at the bottom of Mill Lane is the scene of an unsolved murder. In 1939, a worker from the nearby Ruxox Farm was attacked with \\"maniac brutality\\" on his way to his lodgings at the White Hart Inn in Flitton List of unsolved murders in the United Kingdom. The silver coins of his wage packet had been taken but the rest was left with the smashed body. During the investigation, the local mill disputes and folk theories relating to ancient artefacts being removed from Ruxox farm (the site of both ancient Celtic and Roman shrines) were dismissed by the local police. Scotland Yard concluded that the murder was more likely committed by a passing vagrant. The verdict on police records was stated as \\"murder by person or persons unknown\\". Local Tradition and Folklore There are regular fairs and fetes at Flitton and Greenfield Village Hall, which also serves as a communal recreation ground. A traditional method of \\"stone picking\\" was adopted during the development of the recreation ground when local children were asked to pick stones from the field by hand to remove the bad fortune associated with the 1920s strawberry blight. Maypole dancing was used for several years on May Day as a further example of Celtic pagan tradition. Accordingly, a carnival procession using carts and later tractors, from Westoning to Flitton would be used to start off the May Day celebrations. Fetes continue to be held on the site most years. A travelling funfair was once a regular feature of the field next to the Old Bell Public House in Greenfield. Fetes and fairs were also traditionally held in the field next to Moat Farm. Both of these sites are now occupied by private residences. There are ancient possibly Celtic practices relating to the water and peat resources of the local surrounding areas of Greenfield. Traditionally, people have deemed the water of the local fields and woods to hold magical and healing qualities. One old piece of local folklore recommends standing in the middle of Maggots Moor field and spinning full circle clockwise through the directions of the compass three times with eyes shut. If not struck by lightning, one is said to attain fortune and courage. Washing one's hands or feet in the adjoining river is said to be a tonic for the health (Gurney & Jackson, 1903). The neighbouring Folly Wood was once the home of Henry King Stevens, an eccentric taxidermist and entrepreneur who used the water source on his property to start a bottled tonic water company in the 19th century. His product was even featured in the Lancet for its potential medical benefits. However, he died of unknown causes before being able to profit from exploiting Folly Wood's water source. The wood is now protected as a special site of scientific interest due to its habitat for wading birds, snakes, newts, mushrooms and other rare flora. Local legend has it that the ghosts of two grain delivery men on a horse-drawn cart can be seen or heard chatting and travelling along Mill Lane at twilight. Also, when the spring rains flood the stream, the millpond returns to flood the existing gardens and it is said that the mill wheel can be heard running and grinding corn. These are considered to be benign or signs of good luck. There have been reported supernatural occurrences relating to both Christian and ancient sites in the area. A terrifying ghostly figure was reported in the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel on Mill Lane at several times by children and adult members of the church before the chapel was gutted by fire in the 1960s . In corroborating stories, local residents also reported unexplained \\"cold spots\\" and menacing rooks outside the front of the building before thunder storms. The chapel has since been converted into a private residence. Similarly, an apparition in the shape of an intimidating hooded figure brandishing a heavy staff was reported by several local residents to be haunting the derelict mill during the 1950s. This apparition was also reported at night during the mid 1970s in the gardens of residences that were built on the site of the mill, and several times more recently on the tree shaded bridleway to Ruxox Farm. Sightings of such hooded figures have also been reported along the Flit valley in the grounds of Flitwick Manor, the Ridgeway ancient track, Deadman's Hill Clophill, and Chicksands Priory (O'Dell 2008).

Mokotoff is the publisher of AVOTAYNU, the International Review of Jewish Genealogy, and is the former President of the International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies (IAJGS). He is the creator of the JewishGen's Jewish Genealogical Family Finder and the Jewish Genealogical People Finder. He co-authored the Daitch‚ÄìMokotoff Soundex system. Mokotoff is co-author of Where We Once Walked: A Guide to the Jewish Communities Destroyed in the Holocaust.  Early life  Mokotoff was born in New York City to parents Sylvia Mokotoff (n√©e Friedberg) and Jack Mokotoff. He grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, spending his teenage years in Queens. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Russia-Poland.  Career  = Computer career = Mokotoff joined the IBM Applied Programming Department in 1959, working on developing systems software for the yet-to-be-announced IBM 1401. He is the author of SPS-1, SPS-2 IBM 1401 Symbolic Programming System, coauthor of 1401 Autocoder and participated in the 1401 Fortran II compiler project. In 1965, Mokotoff was drafted into the U.S. Army and spent his entire two-year career in the data processing department at Fort Dix Army Air Base in Fort Dix, New Jersey. He led the team that installed the first computer at Fort Dix (an IBM 1401). For his efforts, he received a Certificate of Achievement from the Commanding General of the base. When he left the Army, he had achieved the rank of Specialist Fifth Class. In 1967, he returned to IBM. In 1968, Mokotoff left IBM to form his own software company with partner Stanley F. Smillie. The company catered primarily to the retail industry. In the 1980s, the company, Data Universal Corp, developed a software system called Riva which it installed in early computer systems at such national retail chains as The Children's Place, Linens N Things and Bed, Bath & Beyond. In 1985, he assisted the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants to computerize the National Registry of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. This database is now located at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. = Genealogy career = The Forward calls Mokotoff an \\"all- around makher (Yiddish for mover and shaker) in the Jewish genealogical world.\\" Mokotoff became involved in genealogy in 1979 to prove, successfully, that all persons named Mokotoff/Mokotov/Mokotow have a common ancestor. In 1980, he joined the Jewish Genealogical Society Inc (New York) and the following year became a member of its Board of Directors. During his tenure on the Board, he used his computer background to develop some of the earliest databases for Jewish genealogy including the Jewish Genealogical Family Finder (now called JewishGen Family Finder), a database used by more than 100,000 Jewish genealogists. Recognizing that there were many spelling variants of Eastern European Jewish surnames, even though they sounded similar, Mokotoff collaborated with Randy Daitch to create the Daitch‚ÄìMokotoff Soundex, system which provides a phonetic alternative to searching databases of names. In 1984, Mokotoff and Sallyann Amdur Sack formed a company, Avotaynu, Inc, which publishes Avotaynu Magazine. This journal has been published quarterly since 1985. In 1991, the company expanded its effort into book publishing with Where We Once Walked: A Guide to the Jewish Communities Destroyed in the Holocaust, a gazetteer which lists more than 23,000 towns in Central and Eastern Europe with large Jewish communities prior to the Holocaust. Originally published in 1991, with a revised edition in 2002, Judaica Librarianship calls Where Once We Walked, \\"the de facto print gazetteer of the shtetlekh of the Pale of Settlement.\\" The book won the 1991 \\"Best Reference Book Award\\" of the Association of Jewish Libraries. Since then, Avotaynu has published more than 70 books, five of which have won awards. In 2003, the Association of Jewish Libraries gave Avotaynu Inc its \\"Body of Work Award.\\" This award has been given only five times in the past 20 years. In 1987, at the request of Rabbi Malcolm H. Stern and Sallyann Amdur Sack, Mokotoff founded the International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies, the international organization of Jewish genealogical societies all over the world. In 1990, Mokotoff became a member of the Board of Directors of the Federation of Genealogical Societies (FGS). He served on the Board, with some interruption, for 15 years. In 2002, he served four years on the Board of the Association of Professional Genealogists. In 2001, Mokotoff created the weekly e-zine of Jewish genealogy, called Nu? What‚Äôs New?

It starred John Corbett as Adam McArthur who was abducted by extraterrestrials 50 years earlier and escapes back to Earth to help improve life for humanity. The series was created in parallel with the world's first webshows, the now defunct Thevisitor.com, which featured alternate characters, interweaving storylines and early use of DHTML animation. The premise of The Visitor is similar to the 2004 television series The 4400. Overview Fifty years prior to the outset of the show Adam MacArthur is abducted by aliens in the Bermuda Triangle during World War II. Upon his escape and subsequent return to Earth, he finds that not only is he still the young man he was 50 years before, but he also has special powers. During his abduction, aliens managed to tap into a largely unused portion of his brain which left Adam with the power to heal and bring people back to life. He also acquired a number of other strange abilities. In the series, he claims that all people have the power to do this but simply don't know how. Most episodes see Adam travelling America and making the lives of people better by using both his deductive reasoning and his special powers. He's driven by what he feels to be a quest to change the lives of strangers. Adam used a small ship to travel back to Earth and continues to use the ship for travel purposes employing a device the size of a television remote to control it. When not in use, Adam usually hides his ship from view. A Colonel from the U.S. Army, James Vise, is concerned about Adam's presence on Earth. He spends most episodes attempting to capture what he perceives to be a threat to U.S. security. FBI agents Wilcox, Larue and Van Patten are also after Adam; however, they don't see him as a threat, but rather want to question him about his disappearance. They often clash with Vise's group. Adam is also being chased by otherworldly forces. Apparently, the aliens abducted a few humans as part of an experiment; Adam being one of them. Since Adam's escape back to Earth, the aliens are attempting to track him down in order to resume their tests. In the end, Adam convinces his \\"abductors\\" that he has a mission to complete on Earth and thus is given the opportunity to save mankind. Vise, who was killed during his struggle capturing Adam, is revived by the one who he saw as a threat and is saved by him. Adam convinces him to find another purpose in his second chance in life. However, the ending is somewhat open because after Vise's \\"death\\", new questions rise. In addition, FBI agents Wilcox, Larue and Van Patten are reassigned (or forced to resign) after the trio's encounter with Adam and Vise. As a show where the main character is travelling to different locations in each episode, the show doesn't feature a large cast of primary characters. Similarly to shows like The X-Files, most episodes feature a supporting cast that appears for just a single episode. Characters * Adam MacArthur (John Corbett) * Agent Douglas Wilcox (Grand L.

From 1942, during the Second World War, he led the Red Army agency responsible for the draft and for the formation of army divisions. Because of the enormous losses suffered by the army, this position was of great importance.
