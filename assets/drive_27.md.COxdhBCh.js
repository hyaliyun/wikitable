It failed to sell and only one was built. Design and development The Langlois JL.2 was an unusually laid out three wing aircraft, not a conventional triplane but a tandem wing design of the Mignet Pou-du-Ciel type with an extra forward low wing. The upper front and rear wings had the same span but the lower one was both shorter and of narrower chord. Its function was to stabilize the pendulum mode oscillations to which the tandem wing design was prone. Langlois intended it to be a fertilizer spreader, or crop duster, calling for robust construction and a more powerful engine than in most Mignet style aircraft. All three wings were simple parallel chord, square tipped cantilever structures. The stabilizing wing was mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and the rear wing on the upper rear fuselage. The upper wing was pivoted high over the fuselage; on each side on a pair of inverted V-struts from the upper fuselage and a single, forward strut from below met at a pivot point. The JL.2 was controlled, like all Mignet type designs, by changing the wing incidence. This was done through two links connecting the rear of the wing and the control column. There were no ailerons. The fuselage was a simple flat sided construction except at the nose, where a Lycoming O-360-A2A air-cooled flat four engine was smoothly cowled. Immediately behind the engine was a hopper for the fertilizer. This was filled from above and discharged sideways, below the fuselage, via two side-by-side, vertical, narrowing ducts which fed spreaders with deflector plates on top. These structures were braced with struts from a frame under the nose. The pilot sat high in the cockpit at the leading edge of the rear wing under a perspex canopy with minimal obstruction. The fin was triangular and the unbalanced rudder rectangular. The JL.2 had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with main wheels on cantilever legs. A tailwheel with a long leg kept the tail high off the ground. The JL.2 first flew in August 1979 and received its Certificate of Airworthiness on 29 January 1980. However, there was little call in France for such an agricultural aircraft, so when the certificate expired the following January it was not renewed and the aircraft was abandoned at Mortagne. It had flown 102 hours.

Indian stand-up comedian Kapil Sharma made his Bollywood debut with this movie, as did lead actress Sai Lokur and supporting actress Jamie Lever. Other cast members include Arbaaz Khan, Manjari Fadnis, Simran Kaur Mundi, Elli Avram, Varun Sharma, Supriya Pathak, Sharat Saxena, Manoj Joshi and Sharad Sankla. Kapil Sharma was to have previously appeared in Yash Raj's film Bank Chor, but he opted out of it. The music is composed by Tanishk Bagchi, Dr Zeus, Javed Mohsin and Amjad Nadim. The film was served with legal notice citing similarities to a Kannada film, Nimbehuli produced by Subhash Ghai. Plot This film starts with a voiceover of the explanation of marriage and how it has changed peoples lives. Then, it takes it straight to the one and only Kumar Shiv Ram Kishan's life. It has been shown how Kumar marries three different women in an accidental way ‚Äì Juhi, Anjali and Simran ‚Äì in order to prevent them from committing suicide. Without letting them know about each other, he makes excuses to spend one night with each wife. On the advice of his friend, Karan, he buys three flats on different floors of the same building for his wives, and Kumar and Karan experience unlikely situations as a result. Kumar also has a girlfriend, Deepika, who he wants to marry, and Deepika's father accepts Kumar as his son-in-law. One evening before Karva Chauth (a one-day festival where women fast for the safety of their husbands), Deepika's father sees Kumar with his three wives, one-at-a- time, but Kumar passes it off as an April Fool trick played by the women. Deepika's father again suspects Kumar when he sees Kumar's photo and believes him to be engaged to a female employee. Deepika and Kumar decide to marry in court to avoid tensions. However, another complication arises as Kumar's estranged parents reconcile, realize they each know their son to have a different wife, then learn he's to marry Deepika. Karan and Deepika wait a long time at the courthouse; when Kumar does arrive, he sees his three wives ‚Äì who have become good friends with Deepika ‚Äì and has to hide. Karan tells Deepika and the wives that the groom went to a hospital to help a friend, and to postpone the marriage by two days. The wives leave and Kumar comes out saying it's okay and they can marry, stopping Deepika when she tries to call her friends. He suggests going to a temple to marry, and sends Karan to bring what they'll need. Deepika's father brings Kumar and Deepika to his office and confronts his employee. The woman denies that Kumar is her fianc√©, and Deepika's father realizes the photo had been left by his daughter. Deepika's father decides to fire his employee for making him doubt his future son-in- law, but Kumar saves her job and Deepika's father decides to celebrate the marriage. Everyone arrives on the day of the marriage, all made to wear marriage clothes so that they can't recognize Kumar or each other. However, Anjali's brother Tiger Bhai is in search of a guy, and makes everyone to put down their pagri (turbans, with veils concealing their faces). Kumar hesitates when it is his turn, but Tiger's men bring the guy and Kumar is spared. The marriage ceremony continues. By chance, Kumar's face passes in front of a fire and he is exposed. Kumar explains that he didn't break heart with his three wives ‚Äì that they forcefully made him marry, without listening to him or asking if he was married, that he couldn't leave them to commit suicide, and confesses his deep regret at breaking the heart of his true love, Deepika. Everyone cries and Kumar's mother hugs him tightly while Deepika's father asks Deepika for her choice. At the end, all four wives are shown accepting each other, with only Tiger left in confusion.

Critical reception Bollywood Hungama gave the film three stars out of five, citing the film as a perfect vehicle for Sharma's transition from television, the directors' successful transition from action to comedy, and the screenplay and dialogues as \\"extremely engaging\\" while calling the music a letdown. Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle wrote that Varun Sharma's portrayal of Karan was comical, but the screenplay was \\"dismal\\", the music was \\"ear piercing\\" and the dance numbers were \\"sleazy\\", with Kapil Sharma's dancing described as \\"stiff\\". Martin D'Souza of Glamsham wrote, \\"it is Kapil's comic timing and assurance of turning a nondescript scene into something humongously hilarious is what tilts the scales in favour of this film.

One of Alpert's most popular albums, the title tune was composed by Juan Carlos Calder√≥n. It was briefly available on CD in the early '90s, but went out of print. In 2012, a remastered version was released on CD by Shout Factory, and is also available as a download on Alpert's official website, herbalpertpresents.com as well as the major online music vendors such as iTunes. Background and recording Released 20 years after the Latin-inspired \\"The Lonely Bull\\", this album marks a return to a Hispanic sound. Alpert had wanted to do something to commemorate the 20th anniversary of his first hit, so he traveled to Mexico and made a recording intended solely for the Latin-American market. However, his interest was kindled by the diversity and quality of the local musicians, and he decided to record an entire album there. Additionally, research revealed that his hit \\"Rise\\" had not made an impact on his Tijuana Brass fanbase, and he wanted an album that bridged the gap between his more contemporary sound and his previous mariachi-influenced style. Stan Freberg directed a promo for the album, satirizing TV commercials in general, but especially Ella Fitzgerald's famous spots for Memorex recording tape. In the original Memorex commercials, Fitzgerald's recorded voice shatters a drinking glass; in the Fandango spot, the sound of Alpert's trumpet smashes a giant taco hanging from the ceiling. Reception and impact Upon release, the album was favorably reviewed by Billboard as a \\"Top Album Pick\\". It entered the Billboard 200 on May 29, 1982 to begin a chart stay of 26 weeks, peaking at number 100.The Billboard Albums, 6th edn. Joel Whitburn. 2006. Record Research Inc. p. 34. . In addition, the album peaked at #20 on Jazz Albums, and #52 on R&B; Albums. Richard S. Ginell at AllMusic gave the album a highly positive review, calling it \\"a masterpiece\\" and some tracks \\"spine-chilling\\". He further stated the material in Fandango surpassed that of the earlier Tijuana Brass output. Stereo Review was much less enthusiastic, stating that there was \\"nothing new or different\\" in the album. Alpert found his Mexican recording experience so positive that he decided to form a sub-label for the Latin market, both in the U.S. and abroad, under the direction of Jos√© Quintana. A single from this album, \\"Route 101\\", hit the top 40. As of 2018, it is Alpert's last instrumental single to surpass that level.

Higgins, and starring Rita Johnson, Tom Neal, Bernard Nedell, Edward Gargan, John Gallaudet and Addison Richards. It was released on August 4, 1939, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot The film opens in a documentary style with narration and the introduction of two government officials associated with the prison system, as themselves, talking across a desk in an office setting. The story is then presented as being based on events in the lives of many prisoners. Kitty is involved with a gang planning a bank robbery when she meets and helps down-and-out Joe in a diner. Joe can't pay for what has been his first meal in three days, and has been unable to find work due to a broken wrist that was never set. Kitty recommends him for the bank robbery when a driver is needed. With the gang on the run from the law after the robbery, Kitty is shot and Joe saves her from being left behind. Eventually, the entire gang is captured. The benevolent, compassionate, and highly effective prison system of 1939 offers help and understanding to all of the gang members, but only some- including Kitty and Joe- are willing to put their lives back on the right path. The prison doctor operates successfully on Joe's wrist and Kitty is allowed to correspond with Joe. After being paroled, both Kitty and Joe are immediately accepted and trusted in new jobs on the outside, but face challenges when another criminal attempts to draw them back into trouble.

It is a right-bank tributary of the Po River. The stream rises in the Apennine Mountains near Monte Penice and flows in a northerly direction into the Po. Geography The Tidone's sources are on the northern slope of Monte Penice at an altitude of over in the Apennine Mountains in the municipality of Menconico. The river flows down a narrow mountain valley called the Val Tidone. The upper reaches of the stream are located in the Province of Pavia while the middle and lower course is in the Province of Piacenza. The village of Romagnese is found in the upper part of the valley. Near the town of Nibbiano the Tidone flows into the Lago di Trebecco which is formed by a dam built in the 1920s. The reservoir is used for irrigation and the dam produces a modest amount of electricity. The Tidone leaves the foothills near Pianello Val Tidone and enters the flat Po plains. The stream flows into the Po west of Piacenza between the towns of Sarmato on the west and Rottofreno on the east. The affluents of the Tidone are mountain streams called the Morcione, Tidoncello, Chiarone and Luretta. The Trebbia River is the next major river to the east. History The Battle of Trebbia was fought near the lower course of the Tidone when Hannibal defeated a Roman army in 218 BC. The name dates from the battle when a Roman centurion found the Tidone's waters to be clear and drinkable while the nearby Trebbia supposedly ran red with the blood of the battle's victims. In thanks to the river, the officer said O Valle ti dono questo anello; ti dono (I give). Also fought in the area was a second Battle of Trebbia in 1799 which pitted a Republican French army against the allied armies of the Russian Empire and Habsburg Austria.

For background see Kyakhta trade. It was never successful because the Kyakhta route was easier than the long trek east from Lake Baikal. The trade route ran from Irkutsk east to Tsurukhaitu (about 7 weeks) and southeast through Tsitsihar and the Shanhai Pass to Peking, over 650 miles longer than the Kyakhta route. By the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727) all official trade was to be conducted through border posts near the future Kyakhta and Tsurukhaitu. Once the Treaty was completed Sava Vladislavich made elaborate plans for the two new posts, Tsurukhaitu being somewhat smaller. Previously trade in the area was from Nerchinsk to Tsitsihar. The site was chosen in 1728 by Temofei Burtsov, a commissar of the Argun silver mines(sicFoust,p83) and a Chinese officer. Construction did not begin until 1736 because of obstruction by a local official and the distance that lumber had to be carried. The site was poor, firewood was over 25 miles distant and it was frequently flooded by the Argun River. In 1756 to fort was moved downstream to a new site. Unlike Kyakhta, the Manchus never erected a fort on their side of the border. Instead it was visited for about a month in early summer by merchants and border inspectors. In 1733 the official caravan tried to return by Tsurukhaitu rather than Kyakhta. Goods were spoiled due to lack of covered storage at the fort, they had difficulty finding laborers and it took all summer to travel west to Irkutsk. Maximum Russian exports at Tsurukhaitu were 2,845 rubles in 1768. The Kyakhta trade grew from 300,000 rubles in 1727 to 5,000,000 in 1805. Today the old and new sites are the villages of Starotsurukhaitui and Novotsurukhaitui with populations of about 900 and 1800 respectively. The name comes from an Evenki word for pike.

It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas to a depth of . It digs itself into the soft sediment of the seabed and raises its arms into the water above to suspension feed on plankton. It was first described by the British naturalist Edward Forbes in 1843. Description Amphiura chiajei has a central disc and five slender arms and is pinkish or greyish brown. The disc is up to in diameter and the arms up to long. The dorsal surface of the disc is covered with scales, larger in the middle and smaller towards the margin. There are a pair of separate radial shields near the attachment of each of the arms. The arms are elongated and are composed of many segments with joints between them, each segment bearing four to six pairs of conical spines. Distribution and habitat Amphiura chiajei is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Its range extends from western Norway to the Azores and the west coast of North Africa. It is found on the seabed on sand or muddy sand at depths down to about . Ecology Amphiura chiajei buries itself in the sediment with the disc at a depth of about . It extends one or two arms above the sediment to gather food particles which are then transferred along its arm to its mouth. It is often found in the same locations as the heart urchin Brissopsis lyrifera, and where this happens it grows more slowly than it does elsewhere. This is thought to be because the urchin churns up the sediment excessively. Amphiura chiajei becomes sexually mature at about four years of age and may live for ten years. The gonads grow in size over the winter and spring and broadcast spawning takes place in late summer and early autumn. The larvae drift with the current and settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis at around eight days. This short larval period means that their potential to disperse is limited. In a population off the coast of Northumberland during the period 1958 to 1964, all the individuals were large and there was no sign of juveniles. Then in 1965 a large number of young individuals joined the population, demonstrating that episodic recruitment is a feature of this brittle star. In Loch Eil and Loch Linnhe, Scotland this species has become much more common in the last few decades of the 20th century. In the 1960s there was an average of about 50 individuals per square metre in suitable habitats, in the 1970s this had increased to over 300 per square metre. It is suggested that this build up in numbers was mainly due to the discharge of effluent from pulp mills. An increase in nutrients led to an increase in the number of plankton and, as suspension feeders, the brittle stars benefited from the increased food supply. The removal of organic particles by the brittle stars may have reduced the consequences of increased eutrophication for other organisms.

Multirate systems Linear time-invariant systems typically operate at a single sampling rate, which means that we have the same sampling rate at input and output. In other words, in an LTI system, the sampling rate would not change in the system. Systems that use different sampling rates at different stages are called multirate systems. The multirate system can have different sampling rates based on desire. Also multirate systems can provide different sampling rates without destroying the signal components. In Figure 1, you can see a block diagram of a two channel multirate system. Multirate Filter Bank A multirate filter bank divides a signal into a number of subbands, which can be analysed at different rates corresponding to the bandwidth of the frequency bands. One important fact in multirate filtering is that the signal should be filtered before decimation, otherwise aliasing and frequency folding would occur. Multirate Filter Designs Multirate filter design makes use of properties of decimation and interpolation (or expansion) in the design implementation of the filter. Decimation or downsampling by a factor of M essentially means keeping every M^{th} sample of a given sequence. =Decimation, Interpolation, and Modulation= Generally speaking, using decimation is very common in multirate filter designs. In the second step, after using decimation, interpolation will be used to restore the sampling rate. The advantage of using decimators and interpolator is that they can reduce the computations when resulting in a lower sampling rate. Decimation by a factor of M can be mathematically defined as:Mitra, Sanjit Kumar, and Yonghong Kuo. Digital signal processing: a computer-based approach. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006. {x(n)}_{\\\\downarrow{}M}=x(M.n) or equivalently, X(z)_{\\\\downarrow M}=\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}X(z^{\\\\frac{1}{M}}). Expansion or upsampling by a factor of M means that we insert M-1 zeros between each sample of a given signal or a sequence. The expansion by a factor of M can be mathematically explained as: x(n)_{\\\\uparrow M}=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\begin{array}{c} x(\\\\frac{n}{M}) 0 \\\\end{array} & \\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\frac{n}{M} otherwise \\\\end{array}\\\\end{cases} or equivalently, {X(z)}_{\\\\uparrow{}M}=X(z^M). Modulation is needed for different kinds of filter designs. For instance, in many communication applications we need to modulate the signal to baseband. After using lowpass filtering for the baseband signal, we use modulation and change the baseband signal to the center frequency of the bandpass filter. Here we provide two examples of designing multirate narrow lowpass and narrow bandpass filters. =Narrow lowpass filter= We can define a narrow lowpass filter as a lowpass filter with a narrow passband. In order to create a multirate narrow lowpass FIR filter, we need to replace the time invariant FIR filter with a lowpass antialiasing filter and use a decimator along with an interpolator and lowpass anti-imaging filter. In this way the resulting multirate system would be a time varying linear phase filter via the decimator and interpolator. This process is explained in block diagram form where Figure 2 (a) is replaced by Figure 2(b). The lowpass filter consists of two polyphase filters, one for the decimator and one for the interpolator. Multirate Filter Bank Filter banks has different usage in many areas, such as signal and image compression, and processing. The main usage of using filter banks is that in this way we can divide the signal or system to several separate frequency domains. A filter bank divides the input signal x\\\\left(n\\\\right) into a set of signals x_{1}(n),x_{2}(n),x_{3}(n),.... In this way each of the generated signals corresponds to a different region in the spectrum of x\\\\left(n\\\\right). In this process it can be possible for the regions overlap (or not, based on application). Figure 4 shows an example of a three-band filter bank. The generated signals x_{1}(n),x_{2}(n),x_{3}(n),... can be generated via a collection of set of bandpass filters with bandwidths BW_{1},BW_{2},BW_{3},... and center frequencies f_{c1},f_{c2},f_{c3},...(respectively). A multirate filter bank use a single input signal and then produces multiple outputs of the signal by filtering and subsampling. In order to split the input signal into two or more signals (see Figure 5) an analysis-synthesis system can be used . In figure 5, only 4 sub- signals are used. The signal would split with the help of four filters H_{k}(z) for k =0,1,2,3 into 4 bands of the same bandwidths (In the analysis bank) and then each sub-signal is decimated by a factor of 4. In each band by dividing the signal in each band, we would have different signal characteristics. In synthesis section the filter will reconstruct the original signal: First, upsampling the 4 sub-signals at the output of the processing unit by a factor of 4 and then filtere by 4 synthesis filters F_{k}(z) for k = 0,1,2,3. Finally, the outputs of these four filters are added. Multidimensional Filter Banks Multidimensional Filtering, downsampling, and upsampling are the main parts of multidimensional multirate systems and filter banks. A complete filter bank consists of the analysis and synthesis sides. The analysis filter bank divides an input signal to different subbands with different frequency spectra. The synthesis part reassembles the different subband signals and generates a reconstructed signal. Two of the basic building blocks are the decimator and expander. As illustrated in Figure 6, the input gets divided into four directional sub bands that each of them covers one of the wedge-shaped frequency regions. In 1D systems, M-fold decimators keep only those samples that are multiples of M and discard the rest. while in multi-dimensional systems the decimators are D X D nonsingular integer matrix. it considers only those samples that are on the lattice generated by the decimator. Commonly used decimator is the quincunx decimator whose lattice is generated from the Quincunx matrix which is defined by \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\-1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. A quincunx lattice that is generated by this matrix is shown in figure. The quincunx Lattice It is important to analyze filter banks from a frequency domain perspective in terms of subband decomposition and reconstruction. However, equally important is a Hilbert space interpretation of filter banks, which plays a key role in geometrical signal representations. For a generic K-channel filter bank, with analysis filters \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ h_{k}[n]\\\\right\\\\\\\\} _{k=1}^{K} , synthesis filters \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ g_{k}[n]\\\\right\\\\\\\\} _{k=1}^{K}, and sampling matrices \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ M_{k}[n]\\\\right\\\\\\\\} _{k=1}^{K} . In the analysis side, we can define vectors in l^{2}(Z^{d}) as \\\\varphi_{k,m}[n]\\\\stackrel{def}{=}h_{k}^{*}[M_{k}m-n], each index by two parameters: 1\\\\leq k\\\\leq K and m\\\\in Z^{2} . Similarly, for the synthesis filters g_{k}[n] we can define \\\\psi_{k,m}[n]\\\\stackrel{def}{=}h_{k}^{*}[M_{k}m-n]. Considering the definition of analysis/synthesis sides we can verify that c_{k}[m]= and for reconstruction part \\\\hat{x}[n]=\\\\sum_{1\\\\leq k\\\\leq K,m\\\\in Z^{2}}c_{k}[m]\\\\psi_{k,m}[n]. In other words, the analysis filter bank calculate the inner product of the input signal and the vector from analysis set. Moreover, the reconstructed signal in the combination of the vectors from the synthesis set, and the combination coefficients of the computed inner products, meaning that \\\\hat{x}[n]=\\\\sum_{1\\\\leq k\\\\leq K,m\\\\in Z^{2}}\\\\psi_{k,m}[n] If there is no loss in the decomposition and the subsequent reconstruction, the filter bank is called perfect reconstruction. (in that case we would have x[n]=\\\\hat{x[n]}.  Multidimensional Filter Banks Design 1-D filter banks have been well developed until today. However, many signals, such as image, video, 3D sound, radar, sonar, are multidimensional, and require the design of multidimensional filter banks. With the fast development of communication technology, signal processing systems need more room to store data during the processing, transmission and reception. In order to reduce the data to be processed, save storage and lower the complexity, multirate sampling techniques were introduced to achieve these goals. Filter banks can be used in various areas, such as image coding, voice coding, radar and so on. Many 1D filter issues were well studied and researchers proposed many 1D filter bank design approaches. But there are still many multidimensional filter bank design problems that need to be solved.[6] Some methods may not well reconstruct the signal; some methods are complex and hard to implement. = Design of Separable Filter Bank = The simplest approach to design a multi- dimensional filter banks is to cascade 1D filter banks in the form of a tree structure where the decimation matrix is diagonal and data is processed in each dimension separately. Such systems are referred to as separable systems. = Design of Non-separable Multidimensional FilterBanks = Below are several approaches on the design of multidimensional filter banks.Quadrant filter banks  2-Channel Multidimensional perfect reconstruction (PR) filter banks  Fan Filters In real life, we always want to reconstruct the divided signal back to the original one, which makes PR filter banks very important. Let H(z) be the transfer function of a filter. The size of the filter is defined as the order of corresponding polynomial in every dimension. The symmetry or anti-symmetry of a polynomial determines the linear phase property of the corresponding filter and is related to its size. Like the 1D case, the aliasing term A(z) and transfer function T(z) for a 2 channel filter bank are: A(z)=1/2(H0(-z) F0 (z)+H1 (-z) F1 (z)); T(z)=1/2(H0 (z) F0 (z)+H1 (z) F1 (z)), where H0 and H1 are decomposition filters, and F0 and F1 are reconstruction filters. The input signal can be perfectly reconstructed if the alias term is cancelled and T(z) equal to a monomial. So the necessary condition is that T'(z) is generally symmetric and of an odd-by-odd size. Linear phase PR filters are very useful for image processing. This 2-Channel filter bank is relatively easy to implement. But 2 channels sometimes are not enough for use. 2-channel filter banks can be cascaded to generate multi-channel filter banks. Four possible parallelogram supports of the two channel filter bank To understand the working of 2-Channel Multidimensional filter banks we must first understand the design process of a simple 2D two-channel filter banks. In particular the diamond filter banks are of special interest in some image coding applications. The decimation matrix M for the diamond filter bank is usually the quincunx matrix which is briefly discussed in the above sections. For a two-channel system, there are only four filters, two analysis filters and two synthesis filters. So in some designs, two or three filters are chosen so that there is no aliasing and the remaining filters are then optimized to achieve approximate reconstruction. Design of 2D filters are more complex than 1D filters. So we usually use appropriate mapping techniques to achieve perfect reconstruction.. A polyphase mapping method is proposed to design an IIR analysis filter. For filter banks with FIR filter types, several 1D to 2D transformations have been considered. For example, the McClellan transformation is used to achieve the FIR filter banks. There has also been some interest in quadrant filters as shown. The decimation matrix for a quadrant filter bank is given by D = \\\\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} The fan filters are shifted versions of the diamond filters and hence the diamond filter banks are designed and can be shifted by ( œÄ 0 ) in the frequency domain to obtain a fan filter. Filter banks in which the filters have parallelogram support are also of some importance. Several parallelogram supports for analysis and synthesis filters are also shown. These filters can be derived from the diamond filters by using uni-modular transformation.  Tree-structured filter banks  Tree Structure analysis filter banks by splitting the kth subband. For any given subband analysis filter bank, we can split it into further subbands as shown in figure 8. By repeating this operation we can actually build a tree structured analysis bank. Example of a 1D tree structured filter bank is the one that results in an octave stacking of the passbands. In the 2D case, tree structures based on simple two-channel modules can offer sophisticated band-splitting schemes, especially if we combine the various configurations shown above. The directional filter bank which will be discussed below is one such example. Multidimensional Directional Filter Banks  M-dimensional directional filter banks (MDFB) are a family of filter banks that can achieve the directional decomposition of arbitrary M-dimensional signals with a simple and efficient tree-structured construction. They have many distinctive properties like: directional decomposition, efficient tree construction, angular resolution and perfect reconstruction. In the general M-dimensional case, the ideal frequency supports of the MDFB are hypercube-based hyperpyramids. The first level of decomposition for MDFB is achieved by an N-channel undecimated filter bank, whose component filters are M-D \\"hourglass\\"-shaped filter aligned with the w1,...,wM respectively axes. After that, the input signal is further decomposed by a series of 2-D iteratively resampled checkerboard filter banks IRCli(Li)(i=2,3,...,M), where IRCli(Li)operates on 2-D slices of the input signal represented by the dimension pair (n1,ni) and superscript (Li) means the levels of decomposition for the ith level filter bank. Note that, starting from the second level, we attach an IRC filter bank to each output channel from the previous level, and hence the entire filter has a total of 2(L1+...+LN) output channels. Multidimensional Oversampled Filter Banks 220x220px Oversampled filter banks are multirate filter banks where the number of output samples at the analysis stage is larger than the number of input samples. It is proposed for robust applications. One particular class of oversampled filter banks is nonsubsampled filter banks without downsampling or upsampling. The perfect reconstruction condition for an oversampled filter bank can be stated as a matrix inverse problem in the polyphase domain. For IIR oversampled filter banks, perfect reconstruction have been studied in WolovichWolovich, William A. Linear multivariable systems. New York: Springer- Verlag, 1974. and Kailath.Kailath, Thomas. Linear systems. Vol. 1. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1980. in the context of control theory. While for FIR oversampled filter banks we have to use a different strategy for 1-D and M-D, FIR filter are more popular since they are easier to implement. For 1-D oversampled FIR filter banks, the Euclidean algorithm plays a key role in the matrix inverse problem. However, the Euclidean algorithm fails for multidimensional (MD) filters. For MD filter, we can convert the FIR representation into a polynomial representation. and then use Algebraic geometry and Gr√∂bner bases to get the framework and the reconstruction conditions for the multidimensional oversampled filter banks. =Multidimensional Filter Banks Using Grobner Bases= The general multidimensional filter bank (Figure 7) can be represented by a pair of analysis and synthesis polyphase matrices H(z) and G(z) of size N\\\\times M and M\\\\times N, where N is the number of channels and M\\\\stackrel{def}{=}M is the absolute value of the determinant of the sampling matrix. Also H(z) and G(z) are the z-transform of the polyphase components of the analysis and synthesis filters. Therefore, they are multivariate Laurent polynomials, which have the general form: F(z)=\\\\sum_{k\\\\in Z^{d}}f[k]z^{k}=\\\\sum_{k\\\\in Z^{d}}f[k_{1},...,k_{d}]z_{1}^{k_{1}}...z_{d}^{k_{d}} . Laurent polynomial matrix equation need to be solve to design perfect reconstruction filter banks: G(z)H(z)=I_{M} . In the multidimensional case with multivariate polynomials we need to use the theory and algorithms of Grobner bases (developed by Buchberger) \\"Grobner bases\\" can be used to characterizing perfect reconstruction multidimensional filter banks, but it first need to extend from polynomial matrices to Laurent polynomial matrices. The Grobner basis computation can be considered equivalently as Gaussian elimination for solving the polynomial matrix equation G(z)H(z)=I_{M}. If we have set of polynomial vectors Module\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ h_{1}(z),...,h_{N}(z)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\stackrel{def}{=}\\\\\\\\{c_{1}(z)h_{1}(z)+...+c_{N}(z)h_{N}(z)\\\\\\\\} where :c_{1}(z),...,c_{N}(z) are polynomials. The Module is analogous to the span of a set of vectors in linear algebra. The theory of Grobner bases implies that the Module has a unique reduced Grobner basis for a given order of power products in polynomials. If we define the Grobner basis as \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ b_{1}(z),...,b_{N}(z)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, it can be obtained from \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ h_{1}(z),...,h_{N}(z)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} by a finite sequence of reduction (division) steps. Using reverse engineering, we can compute the basis vectors b_{i}(z) in terms of the original vectors h_{j}(z) through a K\\\\times N transformation matrix W_{ij}(z) as b_{i}(z)=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}W_{ij}(z)h_{j}(z),i=1,...,K =Mapping-Based Multidimensional Filter Banks= Designing filters with good frequency responses is challenging via Grobner bases approach. Mapping based design in popularly used to design nonseparable multidimensional filter banks with good frequency responses. The mapping approaches have certain restrictions on the kind of filters; However, it brings many important advantages, such as efficient implementation via lifting/ladder structures. Here we provide an example of two-channel filter banks in 2D with sampling matrixD_{1}=\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cc} 2 & 0 0 & 1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] We would have several possible choices of ideal frequency responses of the channel filter H_{0}(\\\\xi) and G_{0}(\\\\xi). (Note that the other two filters H_{1}(\\\\xi) and G_{1}(\\\\xi) are supported on complementary regions.) All the frequency regions in Figure can be critically sampled by the rectangular lattice spanned by D_1. So imagine the filter bank achieves perfect reconstruction with FIR filters. Then from the polyphase domain characterization it follows that the filters H1(z) and G1(z) are completely specified by H0(z) and G0(z), respectively. Therefore, we need to design H0(x) and G0(z) which have desired frequency responses and satisfy the polyphase-domain conditions. H_{0}(z_{1},z_{2})G_{0}(z_{1},z_{2})+H_{0}(-z_{1},z_{2})G_{0}(-z_{1},z_{2})=2 There are different mapping technique that can be used to get above result. =Filter Banks Design in the Frequency Domain= If we do not want perfect reconstruction filter banks using FIR filters, the design problem can be simplified by working in frequency domain instead of using FIR filters. Note that the frequency domain method is not limited to the design of nonsubsampled filter banks (read ). Directional Filter Banks Bamberger and Smith proposed a 2D directional filter bank (DFB). The DFB is efficiently implemented via an l-level tree-structured decomposition that leads to 2^{l} subbands with wedge-shaped frequency partition (see Figure ). The original construction of the DFB involves modulating the input signal and using diamond-shaped filters. Moreover, in order to obtain the desired frequency partition, a complicated tree expanding rule has to be followed. As a result, the frequency regions for the resulting subbands do not follow a simple ordering as shown in Figure 9 based on the channel indices. The first advantage of DFB is that not only it is not a redundant transform but also it offers perfect reconstruction. Another advantage of DFB is its directional- selectivity and efficient structure. This advantage makes DFB an appropriate approach for many signal and image processing usage. Directional Filter Banks can be developed to higher dimensions. It can be used in 3-D to achieve frequency sectioning. These kinds of filters can be used in selective filtering purposes to record and save signals information and features. Some other advantages of NDFB can be addressed as follow: Directional decomposition, Construction, Angular resolution, Perfect reconstruction, and Small redundancy. Multidimensional Directional Filter Banks N-dimensional directional filter banks (NDFB) can be used in capturing signals features and information. There are a number of studies regarding capturing signals information in 2-D(e.g., steerable pyramid, the directional filter bank, 2-D directional wavelets, curvelets, complex (dual-tree) wavelets, contourlets, and bandelets), with reviews for instance in.  Conclusion and Application  Filter banks play an important role in different aspects of signal processing these days. They have different usage in many areas, such as signal and image compression, and processing. The main usage of filter banks is that in this way we can divide the signal or system to several separate frequency components. Depending on our purpose we can choose different methods to design the filters. In this page we provide information regarding filter banks, multidimensional filter banks and different methods to design multidimensional filters. Also we talked about MDFB, which is built upon an efficient tree- structured construction, which leads to a low redundancy ratio and refinable angular resolution. By combining the MDFB with a new multiscale pyramid, we can constructed the surfacelet transform, which has potentials in efficiently capturing and representing surface-like singularities in multidimensional signals. MDFB and surfacelet transform have applications in various areas that involve the processing of multidimensional volumetric data, including video processing, seismic image processing, and medical image analysis. Some other advantages of MDFB include: Directional decomposition, Construction, Angular resolution, Perfect reconstruction, and Small redundancy.

Types of fish in the lake waters include Coregonus albula, common bream, European perch, Northern pike, zander, silver bream, common rudd, common roach and common bleak. Ameryka Peninsula The Ameryka peninsula is located in between the two lakes Orzysz and Wierzbi≈Ñskie, which is sometimes referred to as the Wierzbi≈Ñskie Bay. From the western part of the lake there is a bridge which crosses a narrow gap. The width of the peninsula ranges from about 100 to 300 metres. In the narrowest parts of the peninsula, both of the lakes can be seen. On both sides of the lake there are overgrown patches of Alnus glutinosa. Some roots of the trees are visible due to waves eroding their soil, creating a separate characteristic to the part of the lake. Both of the lakes are eutrophic and have similar water-based plants. There is a large amount of swamp vegetation, including the following species found in the lake: bugleweed, bittersweet, water mint, yellow water-lily, and Canadian waterweed. In some parts the shore has sand and is easily accessible. There are also synanthrope plants in the lake: burdock, lion's tail, common nettle, cow parsley, tetterwort and common wormwood. To the southeastern part of the lake, the peninsula becomes more wider and the plants become luxuriant. There are different types of plants in that part than elsewhere: there are blueberries, blackberries and moss, and in the autumn mushrooms grow. In the forest there are visible trenches from World War II. Along the southern part of the shore of Wierzbi≈Ñskie Lake, there is the stretched village Wierzbiny.

One product of this kind, the Q-Box NF1LP made by Qubit Systems, operates by measuring the hydrogen (H2) given off in the nitrogen-fixing chemical reaction enabled by nitrogenase enzymes. Principle of operation Nitrogen is produced by bacteria, which have an endo-symbiotic relationship with the legume host. In this relationship, the plant shares its carbohydrates with the bacteria so that the bacteria can thrive, and the plant benefits by having excess nitrogen made available. The bacteria's creation of nitrogen also creates hydrogen, which is what the unit measures to determine the nitrogen produced. Measurement of H2 evolution as a means of determining nitrogenase activity is an alternative technique to acetylene reduction assay, and allows real-time monitoring of changes in nitrogenase activity.  Product description  Q-Box NF1LP is an experimental package using an open-flow gas exchange system for measurement of nitrogen fixation in H2-producing legume symbioses. A flow-through H2 sensor (Q-S121) measures the production rate of H2 from N2-fixing tissues, allowing in vivo measurement of nitrogenase activity in real time. Measurements of nitrogenase activity on up to three plants is possible, i.e. a four-channel system including a reference sample.  Operation  Nitrogen fixation packages must be used in a laboratory-type environment. This can be a temporary laboratory set up in the field, as long as it is under stable, uncontaminated conditions. The product must be supplied with many potted samples of the plants and of the neighbouring soil, taken from separate areas on the farm or field under study. The tests rely on the availability of the Herbaspirillum bacteria in the soil. This bacterium is found at the root of most legumes, which is where they produce nitrogen. To test soil properly, it must be free of added nitrogen fertilizers, which have harmful effects on the Herbaspirillum bacteria needed for fixation. Applications Different aspects of nitrogen fixation can be examined with these products, such as effects of temperature on the fixation process, the regulation of the process by oxygen, and the inhibition of nitrogen fixation by an over-abundance of fertilizers.

Depending on the extraction process and the amount of remaining organic matter, spent shale may be classified as oil shale coke, semi-coke or coke-ash residue, known also as oil shale ash. According to the European Union waste list all these types of spent shale are classified as hazardous waste. Oil shale coke was created by chamber ovens which were used for oil shale gas production. Vertical retorts create mainly semi-coke. Most of solid heat carrier processes creates coke-ash residue as the semi-coke created during the process is combusted for the process energy needs. Spent shale can be used as ingredients in cement or brick manufacture.

It is located on Rua Ferreira de Ara√∫jo, a street in Pinheiros district. The current British Consul General in S√£o Paulo is Richard Turner, appointed to the post in April 2009. History The first British Consulate General in Brazil was opened in downtown S√£o Paulo in 1966, long after the beginning of UK-Brazil relations in 1808. Over its history, the Consulate General has operated at three different addresses across the city. Between 1967 and 1995, it was located on the corner with Rua Frei Caneca on the Avenida Paulista, the most famous business, culture and leisure avenue in the city, and between 1995 and 2000 at the blue glass building behind Casa das Rosas (Av. Paulista no 37). In 2000, the Consulate General moved to its present location at the Brazilian British Centre - at Rua Ferreira de Ara√∫jo, 741, Pinheiros. The CBB was built by the Cultura Inglesa S√£o Paulo to bring together, under one roof, all the organisations and activities related to culture, education, leisure and trade between Brazil and the United Kingdom. Many visitors from the British Government and Royal Family representatives have been to S√£o Paulo to promote cooperation agreements, social projects and commercial partnerships. In 1968, Brazilians received the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, who announced the launch of the first British Industry Fair in Brazil. The event took place in Ibirapuera Park in S√£o Paulo and was a huge success. In 2007 alone, there were six high-level visitors: Prince Andrew, Duke of York, Princess Anne, Princess Royal, Lord Mayor John Stuttard, Lord Peter Levene (president of Lloyd's of London), Martin Broughton (president of the Confederation of British Industry and president of British Airways) and Andrew Cahn, CEO of UK Trade and Investment.

History Brothers by the name of Chapman built a mill pond dam on the Little Miami River about 1825 to power a mill manufacturing scythes. About 1846 Benjamin Carlton and the Austin brothers of the Austin Powder Company formed the Austin & Carlton Powder Company to convert the mill to the manufacture of gunpowder. Joseph W. King purchased the Austin & Carleton powder mill in 1855 and expanded it as the Miami Powder Company including a steam power plant and employee residences for the company town of Goes Station. In 1872 Miami Powder Company formed the United States Gunpowder Trade Association, popularly known as the powder trust, with American Powder Mills, Austin Powder Company, DuPont, Hazard Powder Company, Laflin & Rand Powder Company, and Oriental Powder Company. In 1877 Joseph King built the King's Great Western Powder Company at Kings Mills, Ohio which later became the Peters Cartridge Company.

She is set to marry her boyfriend, Guido, with whom she shares a tempestuous relationship. She hears that an elderly relative has left her a fortune, although the will specifies conditions: she must live for six months with her relatives on their estate at Lake Como, and if she loses her temper even once, the money falls to her scheming cousin Bianca.

Party leader and former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan as well as 68 party officials received prison sentences after a court trial, although the former's was commuted to house arrest. Background The Welfare Party, an Islamist political party in Turkey founded and led by Necmettin Erbakan (1926‚Äì2011), had received grants from the Treasury in accordance with the applicable laws. In June 1998, the coalition cabinet of Erbakan was forced to resign following the submission of a memorandum by the military on February 28, 1998. The same year, the Constitutional Court banned the Welfare Party on the grounds that it tried to overthrow Turkey's secular system and to promote Islamic fundamentalism. Erbakan was suspended from active politics for a term of five years. The bans were upheld by the European Court of Human Rights as well. The Treasury requested the return of the financial aid worth around one trillion lira, i.e. one million in today's currency (around 477,000) from the then-closed RP. The party executives declared that the funds were spent on party activities. However, an investigation found that the amount was converted into 10 million Deutsche Mark and was then deposited in Yapƒ± ve Kredi Bankasƒ±. Early in 1997, the amount was withdrawn from the bank. Trial and conviction In the beginning of 1999, Erbakan and 78 party members were prosecuted by the First High Penal Court of Sincan in Ankara. They were accused of embezzling trillions by forging 139 official party documents with the intention to hide the grants, which the Treasury ordered back. The case became known as the \\"Lost Trillion Case\\" or the \\"Missing Trillion Case\\" (). Among the defendants were prominent politicians like ≈ûevket Kazan, former Minister of Justice, and Ahmet Tekdal, co-founder and first leader of the party. In March 2002, Erbakan received a prison sentence of two years and four months. The court convicted 68 party officials to sentences of up to one year and two months in prison. The court's decision was approved by the Supreme Court of Appeals. Abdullah G√ºl, who was the vice chairman of the party responsible for foreign affairs, joined another Islamist party, the Virtue Party (, FP), in 1998. He was re- elected into the parliament in 1999. His parliamentary immunity at the time of the trial spared him from prosecution. Erbakan's imprisonment was adjourned four times as he submitted medical reports about his poor health condition. The last adjournment took place in July 2005 for six month time. After the end of the term, he applied for the re-opening of his case, which was rejected in first and second instance. In April 2006, the Supreme Court of Appeals annulled the court's decision from March 2002. In accordance with the in-the- meantime-amended law, the court reduced Erbakan's sentence to eleven months and two days in house arrest. Erbakan began to serve his sentence at his summer residence in Altƒ±noluk of Edremit, Balƒ±kesir in house arrest on May 2008. Upon his application of pardoning, Abdullah G√ºl, at that time the President of Turkey, pardoned Erbakan on permanent health grounds in August 2008. Former Turkish President's testimony Abdullah G√ºl had been exempted from the trial due to his parliamentary immunity. Later, as he became state president in August 2007, he could not be brought before the court as, according to the Constitution, presidents may not be tried for any allegations other than treason. The re-opened case in 2008 referred to him as a \\"suspect\\". He expressed his willingness to appear before the court. However, the case remained for him frozen until the end of his presidency term in August 2014. The criminal court in Ankara decreed that G√ºl testifies for charges of falsifying official documents as the crime was committed before his presidency. Judicial experts are of the opinion that he would have been acquitted even he was tried because his responsibilities in the party were not of financial nature. As an example, RP officials ≈ûevket Kazan, Recai Kutan, Oƒüuzhan Asilt√ºrk, the deputy chairman and even the general accountant were all acquitted in the past. G√ºl announced his readiness to testify in the \\"Lost Trillion Case\\" right after he handed over his post as state president in late August. In November 2014, he testified before the court with the motive of \\"having justice operate flawlessly and seamlessly\\" and \\"in order not to leave any doubt on any issue\\". On December 6, 2014, the Head Public Prosecutor of Ankara announced its conclusion in the case as nolle prosequi (\\"unwilling to pursue\\") due to missing evidence required for a public lawsuit.

Its studios were located in Washington, D.C. It broadcast 24-hour-a- day. Worldnet had the mission to show \\"a balanced and accurate picture of American society, policies, and people\\".  History  Worldnet was launched in 1983. In the beginning, it worked under the umbrella of the United States Information Agency (USIA). Later, Worldnet became part of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). On September 11, 2001, Worldnet, Using Bloomberg Television, interrupted its regular programming on seven satellites to broadcast raw footage of terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington. In 2002, Worldnet switched from an analog system to a digital one. On May 16, 2004, Worldnet was merged into the Voice of America to reduce costs.  Programs  Programs produced by Worldnet were provided in Arabic, Croatian, English, French, Mandarin, Spanish, Russian, Polish, Serbian, Ukrainian, and other world languages. They were transmitted via satellite, and also via foreign TV broadcast and cable systems. Besides, Worldnet offered some programs produced by other U.S. networks, such as NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Nightly Business Report, Computer Chronicles and Bloomberg Information Television. American English-teaching telecourses were part of the list of programs. One of them was Crossroads Cafe, which combined comedy, drama, and English skills training.  Law  The Smith‚ÄìMundt Act of 1948 restricted Worldnet to broadcast directly to American citizens. The intent of the legislation was to protect the American public from propaganda actions by its own government.Broderick, James F., and Darren W. Miller.

St. Goarshausen, with Katz Castle and the Loreley rock Nassau ( , also , , ) is a geographical, historical and cultural region in today's Rhineland- Palatinate and Hesse in western Germany. Named for the town of Nassau, it includes the territory of the Duchy of Nassau, a former sovereign country which existed until 1866. Occupied by Prussia and annexed into the Province of Hesse-Nassau in 1866, Nassau briefly became the name of a separate province, the Province of Nassau, in 1944. Much of the area is today part of the Nassau Nature Park. Nassau is also the name of the smaller Nassau collective municipality, the area surrounding the town of Nassau. Overview Nassau is located on the German-Dutch Orange Route, and has strong historical and cultural ties to nearby Luxembourg and historical ties to the Netherlands, which were both ruled by the House of Nassau and are still ruled by its descendants. \\"Duke of Nassau\\" is still used as the secondary title (of pretense) by the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. The coat of arms of the Netherlands has a mixture of the Nassau arms and the Dutch Republic Lion, the coat of arms of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg incorporates the Nassau arms in its third and fourth field, and the coat of arms of Nassau, Rhineland-Palatinate also depictes the Nassau arms in its upper half field. The Nassau name is also part of the name of the Dutch royal family, Orange-Nassau, and its secondary titles of Prince or Princess of Orange-Nassau. The Nassau cultural identity can be seen in the name of the regional newspaper Nassauische Neue Presse and the savings bank .

This tea is used for the fertilization of crops. This is an organic alternative to chemical fertilizers and is a more sustainable practice of fertilization. The process of making manure tea begins with the collection of manure. Manure of all different types of livestock may be used. The next step in the production of manure tea involves fermenting and curing the manure that has been collected. This process involves storing the manure in a location that is free from any type of run-offs, and lies below direct sunlight. Once stored, this manure must be checked on and stirred up on a regular basis to allow the even curing of the material. Once this manure is cured properly, destroying any potentially harmful pathogens, it may be transferred into a steeping mechanism of choice. For example, placing the manure in gunny sacks, then completely submerging these bags into a bucket of water. This manure is now steeped over a desired period of time, and spread over and directly onto crops once finished. Some methods of spreading this fertilizer include a watering can or an attachment placed on a hose. The remains of manure left in the gunny sack may also be spread as fertilizer around crops. The process of using manure tea as fertilizer is considered sustainable because it utilizes an otherwise wasted product such as the manure of livestock. It is also cost effective.

Odell was IC4A champion in 1933 and 1934 and United States champion in 1935. Biography Odell was born in the Richmond Hill neighborhood in Queens, New York City. His father, Horace Sr., had a track and field background and had been part of a record-setting Irish American Athletic Club relay team in 1907. The younger Odell represented the New York Athletic Club and Manhattan College, and won the 1933 IC4A javelin throw championship with a throw of 205 ft in (62.49 m). He placed third at the national championships later that year. He graduated Manhattan College in 1935. Odell repeated as IC4A champion in 1934, defeating Stanford's Johnny Mottram, who had been the favorite. The following week, aided by a tailwind, he threw 221 ft 11 in (67.64 m) at the N.Y.A.C. Games; it was the best throw by an American that year, within a foot of James DeMers's American record, and remained a meeting record until 1963. Despite this, Odell only placed fourth at the 1934 national championships and fifth at the NCAA championships. In 1935 Odell only placed third at the IC4A championships (Mottram won) and fourth at the NCAA meet (Charles Gongloff won), but won his first title at the national championships with a throw of 217 ft in (66.18 m). Entering 1936, a panel of leading coaches considered Odell likely to qualify for the United States team for the 1936 Summer Olympics. He won at the Eastern Tryouts, a qualifying meet for the final Olympic Trials, with a throw of 213 ft 9 in (65.15 m); in another pre-Trials meet, the national championships (held separately from the Trials for the first time since 1924), he placed second behind Mottram.

He was one of two sons of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. Domnall's father appears to have installed him as King of Dublin in the late eleventh- or early twelfth century, which suggests that he was his father's successor-designate. Although Domnall won a remarkable victory in the defence of the Kingdom of Dublin in the face of an invasion from the Kingdom of Leinster in 1115, he failed to achieve the successes of his father. After his final expulsion from Dublin at the hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht, and the death of his father, Domnall disappears from record until his own death in 1135. He was perhaps survived by two sons. Background Locations of significant Norse- Gaelic settlements, including the Kingdom of Dublin, and major Irish kingdoms, including Kingdom of Munster.Duffy (1993b) p. 15. Domnall was one of two recorded sons of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland; the other being Mathgamain.Duffy (1992) p. 116 n. 111; Pender (1951) p. 147 (¬ß 1935). Domnall was a member of the U√≠ Briain, a branch of the D√°l Cais, descended from the eponymous Brian B√≥ruma mac Cenn√©tig, High King of Ireland.Jefferies (2005); Bracken (2004a). Domnall's mother was Derb Forgaill, daughter of Lethlobar Ua Laidcn√©n, King of Airg√≠alla.Candon (2006) p. 118; Bracken (2004a). The fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach accord Domnall the epithet gerrl√°mhach (\\"short-armed\\") which may indicate‚Äîif the term is taken literally‚Äîthat he suffered some sort of deformity.The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1118.5; Duffy (2006) p. 71; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1118.5; Duffy (2005b); Duffy (1992) p. 116 n. 111. Muirchertach Ua Briain was one of three sons of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland,Duffy (2005b); Hudson, B (2005b); Bracken (2004a). a man who secured control of the Kingdom of Munster in the 1060s before gaining the high-kingship of Ireland less than a decade later.Hudson, B (2005b); Jefferies (2005). In 1075, in an act of overlordship over the Kingdom of Dublin, Toirdelbach Ua Briain appointed Muirchertach Ua Briain King of Dublin,MacCotter (2017); Duffy (2005b); Bracken (2004a); Bracken (2004b); Duffy (1993b) p. 15; Duffy (1992) p. 103. following a precedent set by Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥, King of Leinster, a previous claimant to the Irish high-kingship who had done the same to his own eldest son, Murchad, in 1052.Hudson, B (2005a); Hudson, BT (2004); Duffy (1993a) p. 34; Duffy (1993b) pp. 14‚Äì15; Duffy (1992) pp. 99‚Äì100, 103. When Toirdelbach Ua Briain finally died in 1086, his sons bitterly contested the kingship of Munster before Muirchertach Ua Briain succeeded in securing it for himself.Duffy (2005b); Bracken (2004a); Duffy (1993b) p. 15. By 1091, the latter appears to have regained control of the Dublin,Duffy (2005b); Ryan (1949) pp. 76‚Äì77. only to lose it to Gofraid Crob√°n, King of the Isles,Duffy (1993a) pp. 35‚Äì36; Duffy (1992) pp. 108‚Äì110; Duffy (1993b) p. 16; Ryan (1949) p. 77. who united it with the Kingdom of the Isles.Duffy (1993b) p. 16. Gofraid's reign in Ireland was short-lived, as Muirchertach Ua Briain forced him from Dublin in 1094. After the Gofraid's death the following year, Muirchertach Ua Briain appointed his own nephew, Domnall mac Taidc, as King of the Isles. U√≠ Briain influence in the Isles was similarly short-lived, however, as Domnall mac Taidc was apparently forced from the region,N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 146, 146 nn. 83‚Äì84; Candon (2006) p. 116; Duffy (2002) p. 57; Duffy (1993b) p. 16; Duffy (1992) pp. 108‚Äì110. and Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson, King of Norway seized control of not only the Isles, but perhaps even Dublin itself, before falling in battle in 1103.Duffy (2002) pp. 57‚Äì59; Duffy (1993b) p. 16; Duffy (1992) pp. 110‚Äì113. Later in 1111, Domnall mac Taidc temporarily seized the kingship of the Isles in an act that may have been opposed by his aforesaid uncle.Duffy (2002) pp. 57 n. 11, 59; Duffy (1993b) p. 16; Duffy (1992) pp. 114‚Äì115. The reasons for Domnall mac Taidc's exit from the Isles are uncertain. Although he may have been forcibly ejected by the Islesmen,Hudson, BT (2005) p. 5. he may well have returned to Ireland to take advantage of Muirchertach Ua Briain's rapidly failing health.Duffy (2002) p. 60; Duffy (1992) p. 115. Kingship of Dublin Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 1115.8; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 1115.8. Domnall's name appears in the top two lines of script. In 1114, the power of a now gravely ill Muirchertach Ua Briain's began to waver.Duffy (2002) p. 60; Duffy (1993a) p. 40; Duffy (1992) pp. 115‚Äì116. The kingship of Munster was temporarily seized by Muirchertach Ua Briain's half-brother, Diarmait Ua Briain. The record of a grant to Christ Church Cathedral, in which Domnall is styled \\"King of Ireland\\", appears to suggest that he attempted to assert a claim to the kingship as well.Duffy (2006) p. 72. In fact, the fifteenth- century Mac Carthaigh's Book specifically states that Domnall was installed in the kingship of Dublin by his father in 1114.Mac Carthaigh's Book (2010a) ¬ß 1114.3; Mac Carthaigh's Book (2010b) ¬ß 1114.3; Flanagan (1989) p. 88 n. 19; Candon (1988) p. 401. Although Muirchertach Ua Briain's problems were lessened with the death Domnall mac Taidc in 1115,Duffy (2005b). within the year the co-kings of Leinster‚ÄîDonnchad mac Murchada and Conchobar Ua Conchobair Failge, King of U√≠ Failge‚Äîtook advantage of his own decline, and attempted to gain control of Dublin by way of a major assault upon the town.Downham (2018) pp. 268‚Äì269; The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 1115.4; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 1115.8; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 1115.8; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1115.4; O'Byrne (2005b); Duffy (1992) pp. 115‚Äì116; √ì Corr√°in (1971) pp. 24‚Äì25. In fact, Domnall's father and grandfather had excluded the Kingdom of Leinster from overlordship of Dublin for the last forty years.Duffy (1993b) p. 17. Furthermore, not only was Conchobar was an unremitting opponent of Domnall's father,√ì Corr√°in (1971) p. 25. but Donnchad possessed several links to the kingship of Dublin as he was married to Domnall mac Taidc's sister, and further had a claim of his own, as both his father and grandfather‚ÄîMurchad and Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥‚Äîheld the kingship during their own careers.Duffy (1992) pp. 115‚Äì116, 115 n. 109. The prospect of enduring overlordship from nearby Leinster, as compared to the more distant and anaemic overlordship of Munster, appears to have compelled the Dubliners to oppose the Leinstermen.Duffy (1992) pp. 116. The ensuing battle itself is recorded by both the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster and the eleventh- to fourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, which reveal that it was Domnall himself who marshalled the forces of Munster to victory. Considering Munster's weakened state, his triumph in Dublin was remarkable achievement. Unfortunately for Donnchad, however, he lost his life in the encounter;Downham (2018) pp. 268‚Äì269; Byrne (2008) p. 26; Duffy (1992) p. 116; √ì Corr√°in (1971) p. 25. and according to the thirteenth-century ecclesiast Giraldus Cambrensis, the Dubliners added insult to injury by burying his corpse with that of a dog as a show of contempt to the Leinstermen.Duffy (2005a) p. 359; Clarke (1993) p. 6; Duffy (1993b) p. 17; Duffy (1992) p. 116; Scott; Martin (1978) p. 67; Wright; Forester; Hoare (1905) p. 213. There is uncertainty as to when Domnall originally gained the kingship of Dublin. His father could have installed him as such upon assuming the Irish high-kingship,Byrne (2008) p. 26. or perhaps following the aforesaid ousting of Gofraid Crob√°n in 1094MacCotter (2017); Flanagan (2008) p. 907.‚Äîalthough it is not impossible that Domnall mac Taidc was installed as king at this point instead.Bracken (2004a). Another possibility is that Domnall had been appointed king not long before his victory over the LeinstermenDuffy (1992) p. 116, 116 n. 112; √ì Corr√°in (1971) p. 25.‚Äîperhaps upon his father's failing health in 1114Candon (1988) p. 401.‚Äîor else not long after his successful defence of Dublin.√ì Corr√°in (2001a) p. 103; √ì Corr√°in (2001b) p. 26; √ì Corr√°in (n.d.) p. 35. Whatever the case, the evidence of Domnall's kingship indicates that Muirchertach Ua Briain was the third consecutive claimant to the high-kingship to appoint an intended successor to the kingship of Dublin.Duffy (1992) pp. 116‚Äì117; Duffy (1993b) pp. 14‚Äì17. Although Muirchertach Ua Briain recovered enough to regain power in Munster within the year, Dublin was later lost to Donnchad's kinsman and Leinster successor, Diarmait mac √ânna meic Murchada, King of Leinster, who died there in 1117.Duffy (1992) p. 116; √ì Corr√°in (1971) p. 25; Ryan (1949) p. 77. Meanwhile, as Muirchertach Ua Briain's power continued to evaporate, the authority of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht ever increased.Duffy (2005b); O'Byrne (2005b); Simms (2004). In 1118, several sources, such as the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch C√©, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, the twelfth-century Chronicon Scotorum, and the Annals of Tigernach, indicate that Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair gained control of Dublin.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1118.6; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1118.6; Chronicon Scotorum (2012) ¬ß 1118; Chronicon Scotorum (2010) ¬ß 1118; The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1118.5; Chronicon Scotorum (2008) ¬ß 1118.7; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1118.5; Chronicon Scotorum (2005) ¬ß 1118.7; Duffy (1993a) p. 40; Candon (1988) p. 401; Ryan (1949) p. 77. In fact, the later source specifies that he had driven Domnall from the kingship once and for all,Flanagan (2008) p. 917; O'Byrne (2005c); Duffy (1992) pp. 116‚Äì117; 116 n. 112; Candon (1988) p. 401. revealing that Domnall had regained the kingship following Diarmait mac √ânna's death in 1117. Although this source also relates that hostages from the \\"northern half of Ireland\\" were recovered from Dublin by Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, a statement perhaps indicative of the power that Domnall managed to preserve over northern realms once firmly under his father's suzerainty,Duffy (1992) p. 117. at his height Domnall's father had been one of the most successful U√≠ Briain monarchs, and Domnall was unable to match his accomplishments.Duffy (1992) p. 116; Duffy (2006) p. 71. Domnall's victory in Dublin marked the beginning of the end of Munster domination of Norse-Gaelic Dublin.Duffy (1992) p. 116. Before the frail Muirchertach Ua Briain finally died in 1119, he was forced to resign the kingship of Munster in favour of his half-brother.Duffy (2006) p. 72; Duffy (2005b). When the latter died in 1118, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had the realm partitioned between Tadc Mac Carthaig in the Kingdom of Desmond, and the sons of Diarmait Ua Briain in the Kingdom of Thomond.Byrne (2008) p. 30; Flanagan (2008) p. 917; Campbell (2005); Duffy (2005b); Bracken (2004a); Simms (2004). Domnall himself was excluded from the kingship. Death Excerpt from folio 486v of Dublin Royal Irish Academy C iii 3 (the Annals of the Four Masters),Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1135.5; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1135.5. a seventeenth-century manuscript documenting Domnall's death in 1135. The annal-entry literally calls Domanall a lord of \\"the foreigners\\" and of Leinster. Thereafter Domnall disappears from record until his death, as an old man at Lismore, dated by the Annals of the Four Masters to 1135. The annal-entry itself describes him as a one-time lord of Leinster, which could be evidence that he had tried to seize Leinster at some point in his career.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1135.5; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1135.5; Duffy (2006) p. 71; Duffy (1992) p. 117 n. 117; Kelleher (1988) p. 23 n. 4. The Annals of Tigernach apparently also record Domnall's death, although the annal-entry identifies him as a grandson of Muirchertach Ua Briain.The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1135.11; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1135.11; Kelleher (1988) p. 23 n. 4. Long afterwards in 1157, Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cen√©l nE√≥gain, a contender to the Irish high-kingship, invaded the partitioned Munster and forced the submission of Diarmait Mac Carthaig,O'Byrne (2005a); Kelleher (1988) p. 23. and further drove out Toirdelbach mac Diarmata U√≠ Briain‚Äîthe son of Domnall's aforesaid uncle, Diarmait Ua BriainKelleher (1988) p. 23.‚Äîand replaced him with another U√≠ Briain dynast, Conchobar mac Domnaill U√≠ Briain, King of Ormond. The latter was likely a brother of Lughaid mac Domnaill U√≠ Briain who was slain in the battle of M√≥in Mh√≥r in 1151. Both men‚ÄîConchobar and Lughaid‚Äîcould well have been sons of Domnall himself.Kelleher (1988) pp. 23 n. 4, 24‚Äì25, 26 tab.

He is the managing director and chief executive officer of Akright Projects Limited, a Ugandan investor. He also serves as the Uganda Private Property Developers Association (UPDA). He has been reported to be one of the wealthiest individuals in the country, with an estimated net worth of approximately US$77million as of January 2017. Background and education He was born in 1963 in Mitooma District, Western Region. He attended local schools and was admitted to Kyambogo Polytechnic, now part of Kyambogo University, to study for a civil engineering degree. However, he left the university before graduating when he ran out of tuition money. Work experience In 1989, at age 26, Kamugisha founded his first company, Kanoblic Group Limited, a real estate construction enterprise. He borrowed money from friends to register his business. He won construction contracts from several reputable firms, including Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited and the Norwegian Forestry Society. In 1999, he closed down Kanoblic and started Akright Projects Limited, a company that plans, designs, and constructs organized residential communities (satellite cities) in or near urban centers in Uganda, as an alternative to the mushrooming slum problem in Uganda's cities and towns.

He was born in Cheetham Hill, Manchester and died in Crumpsall, also in Manchester. The son of a Manchester solicitor with whom he later went into partnership, Orford was educated at Uppingham School and Clare College, Cambridge. He was captain of cricket at Uppingham in 1883. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed batsman and wicketkeeper. At Cambridge, Orford was brought into the first eleven cricket team late in the university cricket season of 1886 and did well in his first game, against Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, as a lower order batsman and wicketkeeper, scoring 29 in his only innings and making five catches and one stumping. In the 1886 University Match against Oxford University which followed this game, he was promoted to open the batting in the second innings. He played more regularly for the first team in 1887 but remained as a lower-order batsman, despite an innings of 76 when batting at No 10 in a high-scoring match against Sussex. The 1887 University Match was his final match in first-class cricket. Orford had graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1886, before his final season for the cricket team. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1890 and practised alongside his father and his older brother in Manchester.

Describing herself as a socialist, feminist, and republican, she is an active campaigner for Scottish independence, nuclear disarmament, carers' rights, and autism care and support services.  Personal life  Sandra Webster grew up in the Dryburgh housing estate in Dundee, where she lived next door to Ernie Ross, before moving to Paisley in her 20s. She has two sons with autism. In 2011, she took part in the National Theatre of Scotland's Five Minute Theatre project, writing a play inspired by the experience of bringing up her two autistic sons. Rosie Kane, a former SSP MSP, played the role of one of the mothers in the show.  Political activism  Sandra spoke at the Radical Independence Conference in 2012 on the role of art and culture in changing society. In November 2013, Webster addressed the STUC's disabled workers' conference in Dundee and called for the rights of disabled people to be enshrined in a written constitution in an independent Scotland. She had previously called for carers' voices to be heard during the independence referendum campaign and for carers to be \\"recognised for the ¬£10 billion we contribute to the Scottish economy\\". Sandra Webster was re-elected as SSP co-spokesperson alongside Colin Fox at the 2014 SSP conference. She stood at a general election for the first time at the 2015 UK general election, as the official SSP candidate in Paisley and Renfrewshire South. During the election campaign, she campaigned to ban zero-hour contracts, saying they \\"exploit workers and attack their employment rights\\". Explaining her decision to stand, she said the SSP \\"offer an alternative to the austerity that other political parties promise to deliver\\" and the party is \\"proud to represent all of the working class not just those who are in work\\". She said she is \\"possibly the only candidate\\" in the constituency who has been directly impacted by cuts to public services and is \\"standing for something real rather than it being an academic exercise\\". On International Women‚Äôs Day on an article published by the Scottish Socialist Party, she claims to have stood by and been most passionate about protecting vulnerable disadvantaged women, such as those with disabilities, carers and women on benefits.

It was described by Francis Walker in 1859 based on material collected at Moreton Bay in Queensland, Australia. It is found in New Guinea and Australia, where it has been recorded in Queensland, northern New South Wales and Western Australia. The species was formerly placed in the genus Agrotera, but in a recent taxonomic revision it was transferred back to the re-instated genus Tetracona, of which it is the type species. The wingspan is about 20 mm. The basal half of the forewings is golden and the marginal half grey. These two areas are divided by an orange submarginal band. The hindwings are grey with a gold inner margin. The caterpillars feed on Eucalyptus tereticornis, a plant of economic interest, which is why T. amathealis is sometimes considered a pest species.

After finishing his football career, he took up speedway. He rode alongside his brother Fred for the Newcastle team in the 1929 English Dirt Track League. Life and career Creasor was born in Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, the third child of John Thomas Creasor, a master butcher, and his wife Louisa.

Creasor rode in the first speedway meeting in the north-east of England, at the Cleveland Park track, Middlesbrough, in August 1928. He rode in the 1929 Scottish Open, being eliminated in his heat by eventual winner Drew McQueen. He competed for Newcastle in the 1929 English Dirt Track League, and topped his team's averages.

From the early 1980s to the early 1990s it was uniquely successful in its longevity, in the fact that it was controlled by unemployed people themselves and in the success of its political campaigns.  Background  The industrial city of Wollongong lies 80 kilometres south of Sydney in the state of New South Wales. The city's economy was based on the Port Kembla Steelworks which in the early 1970s employed more than 20,000 workers. In the late 1970s falling sales caused a series of lay- offs in the steelworks and in the mines which supplied it with coal.Job destruction in the Port Kembla steelworks. Mike Donaldson and Trish Donaldson with assistance from Graeme Roberts ... et al http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21734153?q&versionId;=45108156  Beginnings  Several factors contributed to the inception of WOW. By 1983 youth unemployment in some suburbs had risen to more than 50%. There was already a group of young people loosely organised in YAPO (Young and Pissed Off) who had undertaken a graffiti campaign against unemployment. They were supported by a number of factors within the town. The traditionally militant labour movement had responded powerfully to the lay-offs with coal miners storming the entrance to Parliament House in Canberra and steelworkers and others marching from Wollongong to Sydney, to be met outside the NSW Parliament with a mass demonstration of support. Cultural workers, centred on Redback Graphix, produced art work and a film \\"Greetings from Wollongong\\" which highlighted realities in Wollongong. While business was attempting to badge the area as the Leisure Coast. YAPO's graffiti claimed \\"It's not leisure, it's unemployment.\\".O'Lincoln, Tom \\"Years of Rage\\" https://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/years.htm The mainstream labour movement was strongly influenced by the Communist Party of Australia and, despite the fact that YAPO and then WOW were predominantly influenced by anarchist and punk politics, union officials looked upon them with a degree of benevolence Southall Nick: Working for the class: The praxis of the Wollongong Out of Workers‚Äô Union. http://libcom.org/history/working-class-praxis- wollongong-out-workers%E2%80%99-union The core of YAPO drew in more unemployed young people and in April 1983 named themselves WOW. WOW stated that it was ‚Äúdedicated to preserving and promoting the independent voice of the unemployed‚Äù.Southall, Nick. \\"The Wow Factor\\"http://libcom.org/history/working- class-praxis-wollongong-out-workers%E2%80%99-union Voting membership was only available to people who were unemployed and the elected conveners were required to report back to regular general meetings.  The Years of WOW  WOW's first action was to journey 250 km to Canberra to present the incoming Labor Government with a \\"Log of Claims\\" on behalf of the unemployed. A handful of members established a Tent Embassy outside the Parliament and were successful in meeting with a number of Government Ministers. Back in Wollongong, WOW began its \\"Steal, Sleepout or Starve‚Äù campaign, to highlight the fact that young unemployed people had to survive on $40 per week. In the middle of June, with icy westerly winds whipping down on the city, WOW members began a two-week day and night vigil outside the Social Security offices in Market Street. The aim was to collect the signatures of all the unemployed in central Wollongong, on a petition demanding dole increases, and by sleeping out on the street, in the middle of winter, to highlight youth homelessness. When some of the WOW members were hospitalised, suffering from exposure, it was decided to break into and occupy one of the empty houses across the road.Southall, Nick. \\"The Wow Factor\\"http://libcom.org/history/working-class- praxis-wollongong-out-workers%E2%80%99-union With community support, including that of the South Coast Labour Council, who put pressure on the police and the owner, this house became WOW‚Äôs offices for the next six years. The WOW House became the focus for a range of activities. They kept the issue of unemployment before the public eye with a stream of media releases and media appearances Google News https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat;=19840610&id;=JX1WAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=3-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6680,5541157http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/special_eds/20090420/unwork/ and published a monthly tabloid newspaper, \\"The Gong.\\" They achieved observer status on the South Coast Labour Council and briefly received government funding before rejecting the government's terms and conditions. WOW‚Äôs services included a drop-in centre, welfare rights centre, soup kitchen, library, layout and graphics workshop, dark room, recording studio, accommodation and a food cooperative. Its welfare rights centre provided assistance with collective and self-advocacy in dealing with government departments and with employers, and provided advice and assistance about forms of self-help, both legal and otherwise. The centre helped school people in welfare regulations and self-advocacy and utilised a form of direct-action casework staging militant group actions when grievances remained unsolved. In 1984 when it feedback from members showed that unemployed people with children were being doubly penalised by the tax system, WOW members staged a sit-in in the Social Security offices and demanded a meeting with the Minister to get the tax regulations changed. Within an hour the Minister had agreed to meet them, provided they could be in Canberra by nine o'clock the following morning.

Description and history City Reflections was designed by American artist Patti Warashina, who was inspired by life on a public walkway in an urban environment. It was installed at the intersection of Southwest 6th Avenue and Southwest Main Street on the Portland Transit Mall in 2009. It consists of two bronze sculptures depicting a standing figure and dog, respectively. According to TriMet, which funded the work, the humanoid figure is a \\"stylized version of a strong female in both a classical and minimal form\\", while the dog serves as a \\"counterbalance\\" and is the \\"friendly canine companion that is so much a part of our popular culture\\". The woman measures x x and the dog measures x x . Plaque for the sculpture Both sculptures feature black and copper geometric shapes. The black shapes allude to aspects of the human body as well as the \\"shapes and shadows\\" of nearby buildings. The copper shapes represent \\"computer-generated forms, which speak to the times we live in\\". Dark shadows are depicted on the sidewalk, serving as \\"natural transitions\\" to pedestrians and signaling the time of day. The woman's shadow measures x and the dog's shadow measures x . City Reflections is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council (RACC), which administers the work. In 2013, RACC staff members deemed the sculpture too sensitive to corrosion due to its glossy finish to participate in the Downtown Marketing Initiative's \\"UglySweaterPDX\\" campaign, which outfits sculptures with \\"yard-bombed\\" articles of clothing, to promote shopping in downtown Portland.

In the '400 was created the military hospital and later the Hospital of St. John the Evangelist. In the '500 was born the Hospital of the Poor, in the center of the village, then merged into Civic or Places united, until 1848, when Varese could get 93 beds for hospitalization. Since '800, Varese became a place of meetings and studies by eminent scientists and clinicians: Sacco, Bizzozero, Riva Rocci and Golgi. In 1929 the hospital settled in its present location: the park of the villa of the tenor Francesco Tamagno.

In September 1935 Blankers met Fanny Blankers-Koen at an athletic competition. He was impressed by her talent, but also noticed faults in her running technique. He eventually became her coach and married her on 29 August 1940. They had a son Jan (born 20 August 1941) and a daughter Fanny (born 12 February 1946). In 1935, Blankers also became a national athletics coach and prepared the Dutch team to the 1936 Olympics. Soon after he founded a woman's athletics association Sagitta in Amsterdam to promote sports among women. Within a few years Sagitta became the leading woman's athletics club in the Netherlands. At the 1938 European Athletics Championships its members Fanny Blankers-Koen and Nelly van Balen-Blanken won three medals in the sprint and high jump.

In general, these efforts of manipulation usually refer to shilling attacks, also called profile injection attacks. Collaborative filtering predicts a user's rating to items by finding similar users and looking at their ratings, and because it is possible to create nearly indefinite copies of user profiles in an online system, collaborative filtering becomes vulnerable when multiple copies of fake profiles are introduced to the system. There are several different approaches suggested to improve robustness of both model-based and memory-based collaborative filtering. However, robust collaborative filtering techniques are still an active research field, and major applications of them are yet to come. Introduction One of the biggest challenges to collaborative filtering is shilling attacks. That is, malicious users or a competitor may deliberately inject certain number of fake profiles to the system (typically 1~5%) in such a way that they can affect the recommendation quality or even bias the predicted ratings on behalf of their advantages. Some of the main shilling attack strategies are random attacks, average attacks, bandwagon attacks, and segment-focused attacks. Random attacks insert profiles that give random ratings to a subset of items; average attacks give mean rating of each item.Bhaskar Mehta, Thomas Hofmann, and Wolfgang Nejdl, Robust Collaborative Filtering, RecSys ‚Äò07 Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, 49-56 Bandwagon and segment-focused attacks are newer and more sophisticated attack model. Bandwagon attack profiles give random rating to a subset of items and maximum rating to very popular items, in an effort to increase the chances that these fake profiles have many neighbors. Segment- focused attack is similar to bandwagon attack model, but it gives maximum rating to items that are expected to be highly rated by target user group, instead of frequently rated.Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke, Chad Williams, and Runa Bhaumik, Analysis and Detection of Segment-Focused Attacks Against Collaborative Recommendation, Advances in Web Mining and Web Usage Analysis, 2005, 96-118 In general, item-based collaborative filtering is known to be more robust than user-based collaborative filtering. However, item-based collaborative filtering are still not completely immune to bandwagon and segment attacks. Robust collaborative filtering typically works as follows: # Build spam user detection model # Follow the workflow of regular collaborative filtering system, but only using rating data of non-spam users. User relationships Distributions of cosine distance under bandwagon attacks of different sizes This is a detection method suggested by Gao et al. to make memory-based collaborative filtering more robust. Min Gao, Bin Ling, Quan Yuan, Qingyu Xiong, and Linda Yang, A Robust Collaborative Filtering Approach Based on User Relationships for Recommender Systems, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, vol.2014, Article ID 162521 Some popular metrics used in collaborative filtering to measure user similarity are Pearson correlation coefficient, interest similarity, and cosine distance. (refer to Memory-based CF for definitions) A recommender system can detect attacks by exploiting the fact that the distributions of these metrics differ when there are spam users in the system. Because shilling attacks inject not just single fake profile but a large number of similar fake profiles, these spam users will have unusually high similarity than normal users do. The entire system works like this. Given a rating matrix, it runs a density-based clustering algorithm on the user relationship metrics to detect spam users, and gives weight of 0 to spam users and weight of 1 to normal users. That is, the system will only consider ratings from normal users when computing predictions. The rest of the algorithm works exactly same as normal item-based collaborative filtering. According to experimental results on MovieLens data, this robust CF approach preserves accuracy compared to normal item-based CF, but is more stable. Prediction result for normal CF shifts by 30-40% when spam user profiles are injected, but this robust approach shifts only about 5-10%.

In 1945 she established the Eurythmeum Stage Group, which she also led until 1991. Her work contributed centrally to establishing Eurythmy as a performing art within the culture of Europe and internationally.Else Klink bei der Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls, retrieved 2014.11.26  First experiences in Eurythmy  As the oldest daughter of Hans August Lorenz Klink, a northern German senior colonial official, and Nawjamba Ambo, an indigenous New Guinean, Else Klink grew up on Kabakada, one of the New Guinean islands. While attending a German girls' school, Else lived with friends of her family in Freiburg im Breisgau. When her foster parents died in June 1917, she was taken in by Anna Wolffh√ºgel, a teacher of Eurythmy. Anna's husband, Max Wolffh√ºgel, a painter and later Waldorf teacher in Stuttgart, became leader of the Anthroposophical Branch in Freiburg in 1918 and he invited Rudolf Steiner to lecture on August 19, 1919. Rudolf Steiner recommended that the children take Eurythmy lessons from Alice Fels, who was holding classes in Freiburg. From 1921 to 1926, Else Klink attended the first Waldorf school at the Uhlandsh√∂he in Stuttgart, where her talent for Eurythmy was identified. In 1924, she began taking a reduced load of other classes and spent most of her day in Eurythmy classes with Alice Fels, then leader of the Eurythmeum that stood next door to the school. In October 1929 she went to the Netherlands to introduce Eurythmy there. Together with Wilhelmina Stigter, Klink fought the odds of a foreign language, long-distance commuting and only a small number of interested learners. In 1930 they held a first performance, in which she asked the dramatist, director and speaker, Otto Wiemer to recite and direct. It marked the beginning of a 30-year collaboration in which he was her artistic partner and advisor, lasting until Wiemer's death in 1960. For five years she built up the Eurythmy work in the Netherlands, then became seriously ill in 1934 and was forced to leave. The Eurythmeum Then, in 1935, Marie Steiner sent her to Stuttgart to set up the Eurythmeum once again, which had been discontinued in 1930, and confirmed her as its director.Das Else-Klink-Ensemble Stuttgart , retrieved 4. September 2009 Starting in 1936 the authorities of the Third Reich began to severely curtail the practice of Eurythmy. Klink tried to save her school and travelled to Berlin to negotiate. She managed to come to an agreement that the training could continue, and \\"Eurythmie\\" was given a sub- category under the heading of dance. However, all performing of Eurythmy was banned and the diplomas issued had to be ratified by the Reichstheaterkammer. Unobtrusively, Klink ran courses for 40 students over the next six years. When on July 8, 1941 her students had successfully completed their program and their diplomas, \\"decorated\\" with the required swastika, were returned on August 2, 1941, they were no longer of any value. Eurythmy had been forbidden and the school had to close.Eurythmie Lebenswege ‚Äì 16 Biographien erz√§hlen edited by Christine Lubczyk, Otanes Verlag Berlin (2007) She was then required to do three years of \\"Women's War Service\\" in a parachute factory. When on September 12, 1944 Stuttgart was bombed and the building of the Eurythmeum destroyed, she left the city and found asylum in the village Gundelfingen on the Swabian Alp, where she could practice in an empty barn. Realising that the Third Reich would soon be over, she convinced her pianist, Getrud F√∂disch and speaker, Otto Wiemer, to join her, preparing a large tone and speech repertoire for the stage. When the war ended, she and Wiemer returned on foot to Stuttgart and began holding Eurythmy lessons in the hall of the Waldorf School.Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (1933‚Äì1945) Uwe Werner, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag 24.

As the Eurythmeum building was a mound of rubble, she moved to K√∂ngen where she and Otto Wiemer were able to build up a stage and start a Eurythmy school in old army barracks her principal supporter, Emil K√ºhn, had been able to secure from the American occupation army. Fortuitously, the American commander was Captain John Fentress Gardner, an anthroposophist and well aware of the art of Eurythmy. In 1948 they founded an association for the fostering of Eurythmy. They called the provisional setting of their school \\"Private Eurythmy Conservatory K√∂ngen\\", having done all this in isolation from the rest of the world. In 1947 she was finally able to report on what had happened to Marie Steiner in Switzerland, communication having been cut off for nearly ten years. Marie Steiner, the person responsible for the anthroposophical performing arts, bestowed on her the unrestricted rights to all future activities in Eurythmy. That same year the group gave 17 performances in Wurtemberg and eight in the Ruhrgebiet with a varied program. By 1950 the number had risen to some 50 per year.How the New Art of Eurythmy Began: Lory Maier-Smits, the First Eurythmist By Magdalene Siegloch Temple Lodge Publishing (1998) Performing Eurythmy In 1959 the Eurythmeum was rebuilt next door to the Rudolf Steiner House in Stuttgart with its own financial trust, securing the means for a larger stage group and the incorporation of live orchestral music. Klink worked on the preparation of student Eurythmists and the stage group with a vision of building an organisation and repertoire that could make Eurythmy known throughout the world. In 1961 the Eurythmy premiere of Schubert's 8th Symphony (Unfinished Symphony) took place; in 1974 first performance tour in Romania and through Germany at the invitation of the Romanian Philharmonia Arad. In 1975 she was invited to the \\"Festival de la Danse\\" in Paris to represent Germany. 1976 and 1978 she toured again with the Romanian Philharmonia Arad through Germany following with a tour through the United States and Canada and 1979 through seven cities in Romania, including the Congressional Palace in Bucharest with its 3000 seats. By this time every performance was packed wherever she went. In 1986 she received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. She continued to organise international tours, with two additional ones in America.Eurythmeum Stuttgart: Vocabulary of Dance Article by CATHY CURTIS October 04, 1989 Los Angeles Times retrieved 2014.11.28& In 1991 she handed over the direction of the Eurythmeum to a group of her co-workers and teachers.

About three years later, she went to Vienna, where she unsuccessfully worked as a governess, and then joined a troupe of actors. Under the name Madame Sternheim she worked a number of years on the stage. Theatergruppe Koberwein in Bern, drawing by Johann Jakob Lutz. With various theater companies, among them with the group of Simon Friedrich Koberwein in Strasbourg, Marianne Brentano toured Austria, France, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and even Hungary and Transylvania.

During a stay of the troupe in Strasbourg, the author met the junior postdoctoral lawyer Theophil Friedrich Ehrmann. In 1785, facing the resistance of his parents, they marreied in secret; her seven years younger husband continued to live with his parents and they met only in the evening until 1786, when reconciliation with Theophil Ehrmann's parents occurred. Also in 1786, under the pseudonym Maria Anna Antonia Sternheim, Marianne Ehrmann published the play \\"Leichtsinn und gutes Herz oder die Folgen der Erziehung\\", (Frivolity and a Good Heart, or The Consequences of Education). Duke Charles of W√ºrttemberg and his wife Franziska promised Theophil Friedrich Ehrmann a position as professor in the Charles School, but in 1788, when the duke broke his word, the Ehrmanns moved to Stuttgart.

She sent advance notices to acquaintances, friends and potential patrons to distribute, and the first six editions resulted in an increase of subscribers. The debts contracted by the self-publishing were indeed paid off, but in all a financial disaster, which is why in January 1791 Marianne and her husband started a cooperation with the publisher Johann Friedrich Cotta at his publishing house J. G. Cottaische Verlagsbuchhandlung in T√ºbingen. Marianne Ehrmann hoped to concentrate on the journalistic work. Indeed, the magazine was very successful; the circulation of around 1,000 copies was relatively high for a journal focussed on women's issues. It addressed readers from the upper middle class to support the social situation of women and to urge readers to express their own opinions. During the second year, probably caused by censorship and by the publisher, much of the content became trivial, and Marianne and Theophil Ehrmann's contributions were partially replaced by third party contributions. In the third year, contradicting Marianne Ehrmann's wishes, the magazine became much more commercial and trivial and more adapted by the publisher to prevailing social values. With that, the Ehrmann's quit, whereupon Cotta, using the Ehrmanns' subscriber base, published the magazine under the new name Flora.

Beginning in December 1792 the first issue of Einsiedlerinn aus den Alpen appeared, the first magazine that was edited in Switzerland by a woman. Marianne Ehrmann had to recruit new readers, and the couple informed their previous subscribers about their new magazine. The start of the cooperation with the publishing house improved the business position of Marianne Ehrmann. When there were problems between her husband and the publisher, the publisher wanted to announce the collaboration, but out of respect to Marianne Ehrmann she could continue to draw up the magazine. \\"Einsiedlerinn aus den Alpen\\" largely corresponded to the first edition of her first magazine, to publish true stories and serialized novels. Theophil Ehrmann only wrote a few posts, but took over the correction of the articles. Marianne Ehrmann sought their employees herself, among them David Friedrich Gr√§ter who became a close friend, Friederike Brun and Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel. Editing was solely in the hands of Marianne Ehrmann, but her disease delayed the publication, so that the first two volumes comprised 70% foreign contributions, and were delayed. In early June 1795 the last issue was completed and Marianne Ehrmann, plagued by her years of disease, decided to stop the contribution of the journal.  Death and aftermath  On 14 August 1795 Marianne Ehrmann Brentano died in Stuttgart at the age of 39 years of pneumonia. Her posthumous writings Amaliens Feierstunden (literally: Amalie's celebration hours) were published in 1796. Marianne Ehrmann's visionary dream of an individual female independence and her hope to establish an ongoing progressive female publication were not realized within the next hundred years, but she was regarded by contemporary people as a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment.

He became a trusted official during the reign of Yin's only emperor (later Min's emperor as well) Wang Yanzheng and became known for harsh taxes against the people, leading to the people turning against Wang Yanzheng and welcoming an invading Southern Tang army, leading to Min's fall.  Service under Wang Yanzheng  Little is recorded in historical accounts about Yang Sigong's background, including when he was born, other than that he was from Jianyang (Âª∫ÈôΩ, in modern Nanping, Fujian).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. At some point, during the time that Wang Yanzheng carried the titles of Prince of Fusha as a Min imperial prince and military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenwu Circuit (ÈéÆÊ≠¶, headquartered at Jian Prefecture (), in modern Nanping), i.e., in or after 941,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Yang Sigong served as his circuit surveyor (although it was possible that Yang had served on his staff previously).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 98. In 943, Wang Yanzheng, who had been locked in a civil war against his brother Wang Xi the Emperor of Min (Emperor Jingzong), declared himself the emperor of a new state of Yin. He initially commissioned Yang as the minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu), and then gave him the titles of Pushe () and Lu Junguo Shi (), effectively making him a chancellor (albeit with a more provisional designation than his chancellor colleague Pan Chengyou, who received a more formal chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). It was said that Yang received Wang Yanzheng's favors by being good at extracting revenues. He not only raised taxes on farmland, hills, and ponds, but also taxed such things as fish, salt, vegetables, and fruits. This led to the people of Yin referring to him as \\"Skinner Yang.\\" When Pan wrote a list of 10 areas of governance that he felt that Wang should remedy, Yang's oppressive taxes was one of Pan's items. Wang, instead, stripped Pan of his commission and forced him to retire. By 945, Wang was (at least in name) ruler of all of the Min domain and had changed his title to Emperor of Min. However, he was facing an attack by Southern Tang from the northwest, commanded by the Southern Tang general Cha Wenhui (). Wang sent Yang Sigong and Chen Wang to resist. Chen initially took a defensive posture and set up his defense on a river, and the Southern Tang army did not dare to attack. However, Yang, stating that it was Wang Yanzheng's order, insisted that Chen attack. Chen was forced to attack the Southern Tang army, and fell into a trap set by the Southern Tang general Zu Quan'en (). Chen was killed, and Yang was forced to flee back to Jian.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. It was said that the people of Jian, tired of the warfare among the Wang clan members and the heavy-handed rule imposed by Yang, were welcoming the Southern Tang army and opening roads for them,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. and Cha then put Jian under siege.  Death  In fall 945, the Southern Tang army breached Jian's defense, and Wang Yanzheng surrendered. Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing gave him a general title. However, to placate the people of Jian, he executed Yang Sigong, apparently at the Southern Tang capital Jinling.

L-3605 is the herbarium number given to the specimen that was cited by Phillip Rundel and Peter Bowler in 1994 as belonging to Niebla procera (=Vermilacinia procera), whereas in a revision of the genus by Richard Spjut in 1996, it was cited as belonging to Vermilacinia paleoderma. Both authorities generally agree to some extent on the description of the species and its geographical range within the California Floristic Province. Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia procera is a species in the subgenus VermilaciniaSpjut R. W. 1995. Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae, Lecanorales), a new genus of lichens. In: Flechten Follmann; Contr. Lichen in honor of Gerhard Follmann; F. J. A. Daniels, M. Schulz & J. Peine, eds., Koeltz Scientific Books: Koenigstein, pp. 337-351. distinguished by the thallus divided into long slender cylindrical branches, irregularly blackened in patches from base to near apex, or only with black transverse band or spots. The cortex often develops transverse cracks with age; the cracked cortex is not the same as the cracked transverse cortical ridges that develop in species of Niebla such as commonly seen in N. homalea. Branches are from 2‚Äì6 cm (-8) cm in length and 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter. Lichen substances are primarily three terpenoid compounds, T3, zeorin and (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane; bougeanic acid and salazinic acid occasionally present. Vermilacinia paleoderma is distinguished from V. procera by the surface of the branches having crater-like depressions in contrast to a relatively even surface of V. procera and by producing abundant fertile blackened pycnidia in contrast to mostly sterile pycnidia in V. procera. The black banding and spot patterns in V. procera may be related to morphogenesis of the pycnidia as reported in subgenus Cylindricaria for sterile pycnidia in V. leopardina, in contrast to abundant fertile pycnidia in V. nylanderi. The brittle thallus of V. procera cracking transversely, appearing to fracture off sections of the thallus, would seem to constitute asexual reproduction by fragmentation. Vermilacinia pumila is distinguished from V. procera by its relatively small thallus composed of stubby basal branches not more than 1 cm high. Taxonomic History The genus Vermilacinia was distinguished from Niebla by the absence of longitudinal organization of hyphal cells within the medulla into chondroid strands, and by the secondary metabolites (lichen substances) primarily terpenes that include the triterpene zeorin, the diterpenes (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane, an unidentified triterpene, referred to as T3, and the aliphatic depside, bourgeanic acid. None of these lichen substances are present in Niebla. Peter Bowler with coauthor Janet Marsh in the Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran DesertBowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. \\"Niebla\\". 'Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2': 368‚Äì380. stated that \\"there are no generic differences between it [Vermilacinia] and Niebla.\\" In support of their conclusion they stated that \\"none of the earlier studiesno references were cited for the \\"earlier studies\\" proposed separating groups at the generic level within Niebla,\\" and that in a 1976 presentation he (Bowler) concluded that the hyphal aggregation embedded in the medulla of some of the larger rock and sand inhabiting forms of N. homalea and N. josecuervoi were not of generic significance, and noted that medullar hyphae in all species adhered to one degree or another.\\" Reference to the 1976 presentation was not in the Literature Cited. Nevertheless, in their key to the species of Niebla‚Äîappeared the following statement: \\"Within the medulla individual chondroid strands evident in cross section of blades\\" that was applied to distinguish Niebla josecuervoi, N. homalea and N. isidiaescens\\" from other North American species treated by Spjut in Vermilacinia. In that same flora are Macaronesian species that were transferred by Bowler and Marsh from Ramalina to Niebla as new name combinations: Niebla bourgaeana, N. crispatula, and N. cupularis. These are species that are distinguished from Ramalina by the presence of chondroid strands in the medulla‚Äîisolated from the cortex;\\"Krog, H. & H. √òsthagen. 1980. The genus Ramalina in the Canary Islands. Norwegian J. Bot. 27(4): 255‚Äì296. thus, there is a contradiction in the rationale given by the authors for not distinguishing Vermilacinia. Bowler and Marsh further stated that \\"chemistry is not a basis for separating Vermilacinia from Niebla, because it seems, as they say, there exists a \\"diversity of chemical races\\" without \\"apothecial, spore or pycnidial, or conidial differences.\\" However, it was also stated under the genus Ramalina in the same flora that \\"species of Ramalina never produce (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane that is often found in Niebla,Kashiwadani, H. and T. H. Nash III. 2004. Ramalina. Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert Region 2:440‚Äì456 but according to Spjut, that diterpene is found only in Vermilacinia, not in Niebla. Nevertheless, the mention of a chemical difference to distinguish the Ramalinaceae genera is another contradiction. Richard Spjut, in a manuscript submitted for peer review in 1990, and also in a presentation to the American Bryological and Lichenological Society that same year,Spjut, R. W. 1990. Lichens of Baja California (Mexico) I. The Niebla complex. Am. J. Bot. 77:155-156. indicated that he had recognized 50 species in Niebla and Vermilacinia. This included Vermilacinia procera dating back to 1987 annotations on herbarium specimens at the United States National Herbarium, but under another name. This generic distinction was restated in 1994.Spjut, R. W. 1994. What is a species of Niebla? Am. J.

(2014). AC¬Æ Hazlet. Retrieved from AC Hazlet rye is a medium-sized fall rye variety that is produced and distributed through SeCan, and is then grown in Canada  Crop production statistics  = Comparing varieties = The AC Hazlet rye variety has very good resistance to both lodging and shattering, contributing to a decreased loss of grain before and during harvest. When compared to other winter and fall rye varieties produced in Canada, AC Hazlet rye produces higher or similar yields and higher kernel weights (average of 35.8 mg/kernel) over the competitors. The AC Hazlet rye variety also does very well against winter damage, has excellent winter hardiness traits with a winter survival of 89%, and can germinate in temperatures as low as -1 ¬∞C to 2 ¬∞C while vegetative growth requires a temperature of at least 4 ¬∞C = Comparing crops = Fall rye grows more quickly, matures earlier than other wheat cereals, is the hardiest and most disease resistant crop of the wheat cereals, and it is commonly grown under conditions where other cereals fail. Fall rye is very drought tolerant, more so than wheat or oats, but thrives best in a moist environment. When compared to other cover crops, rye is superior in all characteristics associated with cover crops  Purchase and production of AC Hazlet rye seeds  The AC Hazlet rye variety is produced and sold through SeCan.SeCan. (2010). About SeCan . SeCan contracts farmers from all over Canada to sow, grow, and harvest the AC Hazlet rye crop, which will be sold back to SeCan, who will process the rye grain and send it to local certified seed distributors all over Canada, where the seed can be purchased. Horizon Seeds Canada Inc., out of Courtland Ontario is a local distributor of the AC Hazlet rye variety, where seeds can be purchased by the bag (55 lb), or through premium contracts. The AC Hazlet rye seeds cost $18 Canadian for a 55 lb bag of seed, which sows approximately 3/4s of an acre.R. Van Laecke, personal communication, September, 2014  Cultivation  AC Hazlet rye is grown by farmers across Canada, from Southern Ontario, to the Albertan prairies. Fall rye does not require extensive amounts of labour outside of initial seeding and harvest, and possible pesticide application. It is a very hardy crop and grows well under many conditions = Seeding = AC Hazlet fall rye is to be planted in late August or early September to allow for the crop to grow 4‚Äì6 weeks before cold hardening and vernalization occurs due to the weather conditions. Fall rye should be sown on a field that has not been very recently tilled. AC Hazlet fall rye is normally seeded with a hoe drill or a minimum tillage drill, but in cases where these types of equipment may not be available, it is possible for the rye to be broadcast sown onto the field.M. Bujnowski, personal communication, November, 2014 An optimal seed depth of 1-1.5 inches is required for the best emergence results, the field should be lightly tilled after seeding to ensure the adequate seed depth and a packer wheel should be used to ensure seed-to-soil contact occurs and to enhance winter hardiness and establishment of the crop. As long as the AC Hazlet fall rye crop receives an adequate 4-6 week growth period before cold temperatures arise, the crop should survive well over the winter, as fall rye can tolerate temperatures as low as -35 ¬∞C without receiving much damage = Fertilization and pesticide application = Phosphorus should be applied to the soil during the process of seeding, while nitrogen can be broadcast in the spring. To decrease nitrogen losses, it is best to apply the nitrogen shortly before a rainfall is expected to occur. Herbicide application may be required, and should be applied at 3-4 leaf stage if needed. Insecticide application may be required if there is significant crop damage due to insects, and should be applied early in the mornings when it is cooler and pests will be most prevalent = Swathing and harvest = When kernel moisture content is around 40-45% the AC Hazlet fall rye crop should be swathed, and left to air dry in the field. When kernel moisture is below 20%, the field can be combined and the grain can be further dried artificially. Fall rye is considered dry enough when kernel moisture is below 14%, the grain can be safely stored at this moisture level and it is unlikely for mold to develop  Uses  AC Hazlet Rye grain is a cheap and affordable grain that can be processed into rye flour and used to make rye bread. Rye has a substantial amount of carbohydrates and fibre, is a very good source of manganese, magnesium, and phosphorus, and is also a good source of protein and iron. There are many other uses for rye grain such as harvesting the vegetative growth for emergency forage, allowing for grazing by livestock, or processing the grain into rye whiskey or rye beer.Ontario Ministry of Agricultural Food and Affairs. (May, 2009). Soil Management: Building a Healthy Soil .  Environmental benefits of rye cultivation  Cover crops such as fall rye play a significant role in sustaining soil productivity and soil quality. Rye is an excellent cover crop that has many functions that are beneficial to farmers, these functions include, soil erosion prevention, weed suppression, nitrogen and nutrient scavenging, organic matter addition, and soil structure building = Erosion prevention = Rye is very effective in preventing wind and water erosion and it is commonly grown for this function. The top growth of the rye crop covers the soil surface, protecting the soil from strong winds, and the impact of rain. While the top growth covers the soil surface, the very fibrous and extensive root system of rye, that can reach depths of two metres and a radius of one metre stabilizes and binds soil particles to improve soil structure and further prevent soil erosion, = Nutrient scavenging = Rye is an outstanding scavenger of nitrogen left behind in the soil from previous manure applications or the previous planted crop. These nitrogen-scavenging abilities of rye prevent nitrogen losses due to leaching in the soil, and also prevents potential nitrate contamination in bodies of water located near pertaining fields. The extensive root system of rye may also help to increase the concentration of potassium at the soil surface = Soil nutrients and organic matter = When rye is harvested, only the grains of the crop are collected, while the remaining vegetative part of the plant remains in the field. If the residue of rye is left on the field after grain harvest, the nutrients held in the plant tissue will be restored to the soil to be used by the succeeding crop in the next season. Rye crop residue also contributes a large amount of organic matter back to the soil, which has very positive effects on the soil and for the crop grown in the subsequent season = Weed inhibition = Fall rye has an allelopathic effect against many weeds, inhibiting weed germination and weed growth, these allelopathic effects have been found to reduce total weed biomass by 60-95% in the succeeding year that rye has been grown and the crop residue has been left on the field.Oelke, E., Oplinger, E., Bahri, H., Durgan, D., Putnam, D., Doll, J., and Kelling, K. (September 1990). Rye. Alternative Field Crops Manual. Little to no herbicides may be required for fall rye as fall rye is sensitive to herbicides and if the competitive growth of the rye crop establishes a vigorous canopy early in the season, weed growth will be suppressed  Crop diseases and issues  Fall rye crops are susceptible to the crop disease ergot, ergot causes the growth of purplish-black bodies, replacing some of the grains on the head of the crop. Ergot is harmful to both humans and animals, and if found in grain, should be removed by immersing infested rye grain in a water-salt solution. To prevent the incidence of ergot, fall rye should be put in a 2-3 year rotation. The allelopathic effects of fall rye may affect or inhibit the growth of other grass-like crops including corn, to determine whether this may be an issue, a farmer should grow a small test plot to determine inhibition due to the rye. Many other crops such as soybean, tobacco, and potatoes can still be grown in rotation with rye without the allelopathic effects  References  Category:Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Category:Rye Category:Canadian inventions ","title":"AC Hazlet rye"},{"id":"44531777","text":"\\"The Devil's Share\\" is the tenth episode of the third season of the crime thriller drama Person of Interest, which aired on CBS on November 26, 2013. \\"The Devil's Share\\" is the last part of a trilogy of episodes, that also consists of \\"Endgame\\" and \\"The Crossing\\", the eighth and ninth episodes of the third season. This episode was written by series creator Jonathan Nolan alongside co-executive producer Amanda Segel, and was directed by Chris Fisher. The episode marks the end of the series' long-running HR storyline and picks up from the death of series regular Detective Joss Carter from the previous episode, chronicling John Reese's vengeful hunt for her killer, corrupt NYPD officer Patrick Simmons, while the rest of the team attempts to stop him. Flashbacks for multiple characters are present throughout the episode. Upon airing, the episode was watched by 11.89 million viewers with a 2.2/6 ratings share. It received overwhelmingly positive reviews, praising the writing, directing and acting performances. Plot Picking up from Carter (Taraji P. Henson)'s death in \\"The Crossing\\", a montage of events plays to \\"Hurt\\" by Johnny Cash: Finch (Michael Emerson), Shaw (Sarah Shahi) and Fusco (Kevin Chapman) attend Carter's funeral along with several NYPD officers, Finch learns their next POI is the most wanted man in town, HR officer Patrick Simmons (Robert John Burke), and Shaw and a grief-stricken Reese (Jim Caviezel) separately go about the city ruthlessly interrogating criminals on Simmons' whereabouts. Elsewhere, Simmons receives fake Canadian passports to provide for his escape. A flashback shows Finch attending a therapy session not long after the death of his friend Nathan Ingram; he and the therapist discuss survivor's guilt, with the therapist assuring Finch that his feelings of responsibility and guilt will pass alongside the other survivors of the ferry bombing. Finch questions her assurance by suggesting that everything that happened is indeed his fault. In the present day, Finch serves a still- imprisoned Root (Amy Acker) food and receives an offer of help from her, along with a warning about impending dangers on a larger scale. Finch is interrupted by a phone call from Fusco, who is investigating the scene of an SUV Reese crashed earlier, belonging to three forgers working for one Seamus Yorke, who they believe can lead them to Simmons. Shaw has already located Yorke (Brian Tarantina) and is attempting to interrogate him, agreeing to locate Reese, but only to save him from gunshot wounds he suffered in the previous episode. Yorke names HR leader Alonzo Quinn (Clarke Peters) as the only one who knows of Simmons' escape plan. Fusco and Shaw find Quinn's lawyer dead and learn that Russian mobsters are also targeting Simmons. They decide finally to request Root's help. The next flashback centers on Shaw, at that time a physician, being interviewed over her lack of sympathy for her patients. Her interviewer notes that her technical mastery isn't the kind of motivation sympathy provides to save patients and tells her that she is a \\"fixer\\" and not a \\"healer\\". Despite potential consequences, Root is freed and directs them to an apartment in which Quinn is being held under police custody. They evade the army of U.S. Marshals and Russian mob forces closing in, while Reese detonates a nearby car to provide a distraction. The third flashback shows a supposedly militant Reese being interviewed by a CIA Special Ops psychologist on how extreme his measures can be pushed in order to protect his country. Reese claims to have already been through the horrors the psychologist presents as part of Reese's new job, revealing that he is in fact already a CIA operative sent out to find a traitor among them: the psychologist. Reese shoots the man dead. Reese battles his way through the marshals while Quinn attempts negotiating with the head marshal, Pollack (Richard Brooks), in his hotel room. Reese's attacks outside change Pollack's mind, but Reese sets off emergency flares throughout the halls and fights his way into Quinn's room. Reese demands to know Simmons' escape route in the next three minutes, dismissive of Quinn's protestations of loyalty. Down below, the team is able to make it past the marshals and Finch arrives just as Reese is about to kill Quinn, having obtained Simmons' location. Finch tries to convince Reese that killing Quinn would betray Carter's principles of bringing Quinn down lawfully, but Reese pulls the trigger of his weapon, but it fails to fire. Reese collapses and is moved out while officers enter and take Quinn away. In the car, Root points out that Reese wasn't Simmons' only predator, while Fusco is seen stealing the paper on which Quinn wrote Simmons' location. The fourth and final flashback depicts Fusco receiving therapy after having shot a drug dealer. His therapist attempts to empathize with his potential guilt or trauma following the incident, but Fusco reveals to him that the shooting was deliberate, and out of retribution for the dealer's killing of a rookie cop who was expecting a child. He identifies the presence of the \\"devil's share\\" within his act, a term for righteous revenge. Satisfied, he leaves. Fusco confronts Simmons at an airfield, having canceled his flight out of New York. Simmons tries to goad Fusco into killing him, but the two instead engage in a savage fistfight, of which Fusco is the victor. He explains to Simmons that his devotion to Carter came from her instilling in him the correct moral code borne by a true police officer, and refuses to betray that by killing Simmons. He follows by arresting him and delivering him to the precinct shortly afterwards, stunning his coworkers. Shaw confirms to Finch that Reese, who is hospitalized, will survive. Finch returns to the library to find Root having willingly kept herself in containment, claiming to be there to prepare for a larger battle at hand. That night, Carl Elias (Enrico Colantoni) visits a hospitalized Simmons, explaining his debt to Carter and how the moral principles of people of his level extend beyond those of civilization. Free of Carter's moral conduct following her death, Elias uses this as justification to kill Simmons, and then watches while his henchman Scarface (David Valcin) garrotes Simmons and kills him.  Production  \\"The Devil's Share\\" was written by series creator Jonathan Nolan and co-executive producer Amanda Segel, marking both writers' eighth episodes written for the series. It was directed by co-executive producer Chris Fisher, his sixth directing credit for the series.

The genus contains four described species, Metanephrocerus belgardeae, M. collini, M. groehni, and M. hoffeinsorum. Metanephrocerus is known from a group of Middle Eocene fossils which were found in Europe and a single early Eocene fossil from North America.  History and classification  When first described, Metanephrocerus was known only from two separate fossils, the holotype female, and the female paratype were fossilized as inclusions in transparent chunks of Baltic amber. Baltic amber is approximately forty-six million years old, having been deposited during the Lutetian stage of the Middle Eocene. There is debate on what plant family produced the amber, with evidence supporting relatives of either an Agathis or a Pseudolarix relative. Fossils of the type species, M. collini, were first studied by American entomologist Frank M. Carpenter and F. M. Hull who placed the new species in the fossil genus Protonephrocerus. Carpenter and Hull's 1939 type description of the new species was published in the monograph series Bernstein- Forschungens. The species was moved to the new genus Metanephrocerus in a 1948 paper by Martin L Acz√©l, and since that time both the type specimens have been lost and are considered possibly destroyed. After the M. collini description, 75 years passed before an additional three related species were described. Two of those, M. groehni and M. hoffeinsorum. were described from solitary fossil inclusions in Baltic amber. The 2014 descriptions were made by Christian Kehlmaier, Manuel Dierick and Jeffrey H. Skevington, based on detailed CT scans of the specimens. They chose the species name \\"groehni\\" is a patronym honoring Carsten Gr√∂hn, who supported the research of the authors, and who was the owner of the specimen before description. The fossil was to be deposited into the collections of the Geologisch-Pal√§ontologisches Institut und Museum der Universit√§t Hamburg Similarly, the epithet of the second species \\"hoffeinsorum\\" is a patronym for Christel and Hans-Werner Hoffeins for the donation of the type fossil to the Senckenberg Deutsches Entomologisches Institut and for their support of the authors research. The third related species, M. belgardeae, bringing the total to four, was described from a compression fossil found in the early Eocene, Ypresian Klondike Mountain Formation lagerst√§tten, its discovery expanding both the temporal range and geographic range. M. belgardeae was described by S. Bruce Archibald, Christian Kehlmaier, and Rolf Mathewes from a single partial female. The specific epithet is a matronym of Azure Rain Belgarde, who collected the type specimen, SR 08-06-02, and donated it to the Stonerose Interpretive Center. Placement of the group has changed several times, with Metanephrocerus and Protonephrocerus being placed in the pipunculid subfamily Nephrocerinae as tribe Protonephrocerini from 1948 until 2014. The placement of the tribe was challenged in 2014 by Kehlmaier, Dierick and Skevington who suggested inclusion of the genera made Nephrocerinae paraphyletic. As such they elevated the tribe Protonephrocerini to the subfamily rank as Protonephrocerinae, leaving only Nephrocerus and Priabona in Nephrocerinae.  Description  Metanephrocerus belgardeae is a large species, with a wing length of , and a hyaline wing coloration, broken by a smokey tone to the pterostigma and basal area of the wing. The wing has a long third section of the costal vein and the median vein that is long and straight. The females abdomen is approximately long, with short setae on the tergites, which grade to longer tergites on the first and second tergites. The short abdominal setae are distinct for the genus and exclude the species from other pipnculid genera. M. collini was known from 2 female specimens, which had hyaline wings with colored pterostigma. M. groehni is a nearly complete male fly with a total body length of , and is only missing the tip of the left hind leg. The hind legs show a distinct chaetotaxy to the setae, with front sides having setae that are longer than the femur is wide. The eyes connect for three times the length of the frons. The wings are , though the wings are folded slightly and difficult to fully assess. The halters are darkened at the base and on the knob. M. hoffeinsorum is a whole male, though large portions of it are enclosed in white mold and the specimen has a total length of . The wings show a length of and have a covering of microtrichia. As with M. groehni the halters have darkened knobs and bases and the pteropleuron has 6 hairs on it. Tergite three of the abdomen is 1.3 times as long as tergite two.

Olshanski first appeared in politics as Grand Duke's marshal in 1488. Two years later he became starosta of Lutsk and successfully defended Volhynia from the Tatar invasion during the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1485‚Äì1503). He commanded the army in the victorious Battle of Zas≈Çaw in January 1491 and was promoted to Marshal of Volhynia. In 1495, sons of Khan Me√±li I Giray invaded Volhynia and Olshanski successfully defended the besieged Korets. Next year, the Tatars invaded again and attacked Rivne where Olshanski and Konstanty Ostrogski were hiding. They rode out to attack the invaders, but had to retreat once the main Tatar forces arrived. The invaders burned the city, but did not manage to capture the castle. When his son-in-law Konstanty Ostrogski was captured in the Battle of Vedrosha in July 1500, Olshanski became the Great Hetman (commander of the army) of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Grand Duke brokered alliances with the Livonian Order and Great Horde, but the Lithuanian army did not organize more active defense and Olshanski was replaced by Stanislovas Kƒôsgaila in 1501 or 1502. Jan Litawor Chreptowicz, regent of Navahrudak, was also taken captive at Vedrosha. He was married to Hedwig Olshanska, Semyon's niece, and Olshanski took over Navahrudak. Here as well he was soon replaced by Piotr Hlebowicz. However, he was able to hold the title of starosta of Kremenets from early 1501 until his death in 1505 or 1506. In 1502, Olshanski returned to Volhynia and once again organized defense against the Crimean Khanate that attacked Babruysk, Turov, and Brest.

Background Landzeal was a business that did vehicle graphics, and employed Simon Kyne and Gary Moynan. Kyne and Moynan later left Landzeal, and Landzeal filed for restraint of trade injunctions against both of them. Kyne filed to have the interim injunction to be rescinded on the grounds that the restraint of trade clause that Landzeal produced to the court as evidence to support an injunction, Kyne claimed was not part of the original contract he signed. It turned out that Kyne was first given the original contract to sign, it was missing the page regarding the pay rates. Landzeal, then provided a new copy of the contract with the pay schedule, which Kyne then signed. However, this version of the contract also had added a restraint of trade clause. Kyne pleaded that as this clause was secretly included in the revised second copy of the contract, that it was not legally enforceable under non est factum. In Moynans case, whom had a restraint of trade clause in his contract, instead claimed the restraint of trade of 12 months was unreasonable. Held The High Court ruled that Kyne's plea of non est factum was successful, making restraint of trade unenforceable. Moynan however was not so lucky, with the court ruling a restraint of trade enforceable, although the time period was reduced to only 6 months.

Its aim was to broaden the scope of music, comedy, burlesque, cabaret, art and theatre events happening in Glasgow's southside (predominantly the Shawlands and Queen's Park areas) around the time of the Southside Festival in May. This led to the first full Southside Fringe Festival in May 2013 which was set up by musician Crawford Smith and burlesque star Corinna Currie (also known as 'Sarcassy Sneek' ) to respond to demand for localised music, comedy, burlesque and cabaret events in local venues.

The painting exemplifies the rococo love of asymmetric lines and sinuous curves, artfully arranged to seduce both the eye and the mind of the beholder.\\"] The painting depicts a mythological scene, where Venus, the goddess of Love, depicted as a charming and supple young woman, is impersonating the French Rococo's beauty ideals. She is about to disarm Cupid, by taking away his arrows, that he uses when shooting at people to make them fall in love. > \\"In Enlightenment France the dedicated search to define truth engendered a > re‚Äìevaluation of the natural. The belief that it was right to follow nature, > and that the pursuit of pleasure was natural, influenced the prevailing > conception of the nude ... Venus sits beside the pond with doves, the goddess symbol. The white doves at her feet, her complexion, the pearls in her hair are just as luxurious like the silk draperies that were wrapped around her, but now are lying on the ground. Boucher painted the artwork with soft pastel tones using a dim silvery light. The painting was made with high technical skill. The principal charm of Rococo art is its sensuality and seductivity. History The painting belonged to Mme de Pompadour, the French king's mistress, displayed at Ch√¢teau de Bellevue, who commissioned it, and it was Madame de Pompadour who allegedly posed for the painting. Artists liked to work for her not only for the prestige of working for the aristocracy, but also because she paid her bills regularly. It has even been suggested that Boucher's young wife was the young woman posing for the figure of Venus, but it is more a soft and appealing essence of feminine beauty, that appears in front of us in the figure of the Venus painted by the French artist Boucher.

After his death, the building was confiscated by the republic, and it has served various purposes over the years. Only in 1924 was it selected to house the art collection, which until then was housed in the Palazzo Pubblico. In 1948 it was donated to the Italian state, which carried out a more organized preservation campaign and at the same time rearranged the collection, subsequently distributing it between this villa and the Palazzo Mansi. The late-Gothic building was constructed from 1413 to 1418 as a Villa di Delizia. It has an imposing brick fa√ßade with central ground-floor portico.

Biography Dalmiro Antonio Saenz was born in Buenos Aires, in 1926. He began his literary activity early on, and began to publish by his 30s after he traveled during several seasons by ship through Patagonia, he settled there for almost 15 years, where he developed his first storybook: \\"Seventy Times Seven,\\" which won the prestigious award of Editorial Emec√©, and became a bestseller, based in a vision that is violent, erotic, and with solid precepts and moral questions about religion. That is what would become the hallmark of S√°enz for several years. The critics agree in indicating that a religious axis always passes through the stories of this author; either through one of his characters or as in \\"Christ Pie\\", where religiosity is in controversy with the established religion, as opposed to the individual dialogue that the character has with God). Later on, he participated in the screenplay adaptation for the big screen of the two stories in \\"Seventy Times Seven\\", that were joined to assemble the frame for the homonymous film directed by Leopoldo Torre Nilson (1962). After this onset, S√°enz won the Award of Life magazine in Spanish, in 1963, with his storybook \\"No\\". The same year, he won the award Argentores by the Sociedad Argentina de Autores with \\"Thirty Thirty\\", a tale raised in the manner of an American western, but located in Patagonia. In 1964 he published in the Editorial Emec√© The Necessary Sin, a novel that was later adapted to create the script for the film version, called Nobody heard Cecilio Fuentes scream directed by Fernando Siro, and winner of the Silver Shell (Concha de Plata) in the International Film Festival of San Sebastian, Spain (1965). Then he began to write plays and very soon he was awarded the prize ‚ÄúCasa de las Am√©ricas‚Äù, in Cuba in 1966, with Hip Hip Ufa, published by Editorial Emec√©, and was adapted to create the script for the film version with the title Ufa con el sexo (1968) under the direction of Rodolfo Kuhn. Then he worked again in its adaptation with Pablo Silva, for the well-known play \\"Sex, Lies and Money\\" (Bs As. 2002/3). According to his statements, S√°enz took literary vacations between books by writing small books of humor, which were very successful. Among them stands out \\"I Also Was A Spermatozoid\\" published by the editorial Torres Ag√ºero. Then began an intimate and detailed description of the feminine universe, with a vision that is surprising and original, and promptly became a bestseller titled \\"Open Letter To My Future Ex-wife\\" published by editorial Emec√© in 1968, and re-edited several times, until the last version in 1999. Saenz is an author who can capture the essence of the feminine sensibility, characters that he treats with a great deal of tenderness. His next play Who me? was published in 1969 and re-edited by Gargoyle editions in 2004, was played almost without interruption since its publication, and it became a classic of the absurd in the Argentine theater scene. He also worked as a screenwriter for various characters, including one for comic actor Luis Sandrini in the film Kuma-ching, under the direction of Daniel Tinayre. When Argentina was under military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983, S√°enz received death threats and had to leave the country in exile. After touring for a while, he settled in Punta del Este, Uruguay. During that period he did not write at all. He returns in 1983 with the historical novel \\"El Argentinazo\\", winning the ‚ÄúFaja de Honor‚Äù of the SADE (Sociedad Argentina de Escritores) that later would become a play, in which he worked together with Francisco Javier, director of the piece, in its adaptation, staged by his group Los Volatineros (The Acrobats) at the Cervantes National Theatre in 1985. Then he returns to police stories, already hinted in his early tales, with \\"On His Open Eyelids Walked A Fly\\" a novel of 1986, that also turned into a theatrical version, written by Saenz and entitled ‚ÄúThe Boludas\\", also turned into a film. And \\"the Satyr of The Roaring Laugh\\" based on real events. Later on, he began to investigate the Dead Sea Scrolls and the figure of Jesus Christ in association with Dr. Alberto Cormillot. They traveled together through Israel, Egypt, and New York, interviewing personalities related to the subject, and all of this led to the publication of \\"Christ standing\\" (Editorial Planeta 1995 and 1998). Later he continues its unique, human, erotic, and poetic vision of the Argentine caudillos in his historical novels \\"The Wrong Patria\\" (Editorial Planeta, 1991), \\" White Mal√≥n \\" (Editorial Emec√© 1995) and \\"My Forgetfulness / O what General Paz Didn‚Äôt Said In His Memoirs \\"(1998, Editorial Sudamericana). In 2004 he published \\"As A Writer\\" with some formulas on how he wrote his best stories, and the novel \\"Pastor Of Bats\\" (G√°rgola Ediciones, 2005) Many of his works have been translated and published in different languages, and his stories show up in numerous compilations, as in \\"Latin Blood\\" by Donald Yates (The best crime and detective stories of South America / Editorial Herder and Herder New York 1972); or \\"The Best Patagonian Narrations\\" by Mary Belts & Cristian Aliaga, Editorial Ameghino Buenos Aires 1988, among others. He currently lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he works as a writer, coordinates its literary workshop and also makes cultural commentaries on the radio, in addition to writing articles as free-lance for the most prestigious newspapers and magazines.

The head of the riyasat is Reis-ul-ulema (Grand Mufti).  History  During the Ottoman Empire, all Muslims were subjected to the shaykh al-IslƒÅm, the supreme religious authority, even though the sultan maintained the title of kaliph. After Austrian-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, general Josip Filipoviƒá, who led the occupation, received instructions that Bosnian Muslims should become independent from the shaykh al-IslƒÅm in Istanbul. The Austrian-Hungarian authorities had in plan to make this separation look like a local initiative. After Filipoviƒá failed to do so, Gyula Andr√°ssy, at the time foreign minister of Austria-Hungary, tried to do the same through joint Austro-Hungarian Ministry of Finance, which was responsible for Bosnia and Herzegovina, headed by B√©ni K√°llay, and governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Josip Filipoviƒá. Andr√°ssy saw this as a political instrument to strengthen the position of the Austro-Hungarian authorities in newly occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnian Muslims fiercely opposed to this move of the Austrian-Hungarian authorities. The conflict reached its peak when the Ottoman Sublime Porte named Ahmed ≈û√ºkr√º, a former Rumelian kazasker, a new Bosnian-Herzegovinian mufti on 18 June 1880. They based their decision on the Novi Pazar Convention of 1879 between Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, in which, among other things, Austria-Hungary committed to respect Bosnian Muslims' religious freedoms, while Bosnian Muslims received the right to maintain religions connections with shaykh al-IslƒÅm in Istanbul. Bosnian Muslims opposed any separation from Istanbul. Austria-Hungary agreed that shaykh al-IslƒÅm could appoint religious officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but only from the local population. They asked from the Austrian-Hungarian ambassador in Istanbul to prevent ≈û√ºkr√º from taking the office of Bosnian- Herzegovinian Mufti. The Austrian-Hungarian authorities saw Husein Nur Hafizoviƒá as chief representative of Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina who was at the time supreme sharia judge in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the end, Austrian-Hungarian authorities succeeded in preventing ≈û√ºkr√º from taking the office of mufti and shaykh al-IslƒÅm Uryanizade Ahmed Esad named Mustafa Hilmi Had≈æiomeroviƒá a new Bosnian-Herzegovinian mufti. Had≈æiomeroviƒá was known as suitable person for the Austro-Hungarian authorities. Immediately after the Austrian-Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina, he called for Bosnian Muslims to accept military laws of the Austrian-Hungarian occupational administration. On 17 October 1882, emperor Franz Joseph issued an imperial decree in which he proclaimed Had≈æiomeroviƒá a reis-ul-ulema (grand mufti) of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This made Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina independent from the Ottoman religious authority, and nobody from the Ottoman Empire opposed this decision of the Austrian-Hungarian emperor. After Had≈æiomeroviƒá was named grand mufti, the institution of Riyasat, as main executive body of the Islamic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was established. It was a unique institution in all of the Islamic World. B√©ni K√°llay's efforts of creating an independent Islamic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina were finally realised. The emperor had the right to name grand muftis and heads of majlises. Other Islamic religious officials were named by the Land Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Equipped with only a engine, Uncle Sam could only carry 35 tons of supplies, taking 15 days to make the first trip. Uncle Sam made many trips up and down the river for four months to finish carrying all the supplies for the fort, improving its time up river to 12 days. Negligence caused it to sink at its dock below Fort Yuma, and was then washed away and lost before it could be raised, in the spring flood of 1853.

The genus contains a single described species, Priabona florissantius. Priabona is known from a group of Middle Eocene fossils found in Europe and a single Early Eocene fossil from the Okanagan Highlands, western North America.  History and classification  Priabona is known from a compression-impression fossil preserved in fine shale of the Florissant formation in Colorado. The formation is composed of successive lake deposits which have preserved a diverse assemblage of insects. The insects and plants suggest a climate similar to modern Southeastern North America, with a number of taxa represented that are now found in the subtropics to tropics and confined to the Old World. When Priabona was described, the Florissant formation was considered to be Miocene in age, based on the flora and fauna preserved. Subsequent research and fossil descriptions permitted a re-examined dating, and by 1985 the formation had been reassigned to an Oligocene age. Further refinement of the formation's age using radiometric dating of sanidine crystals has resulted in an age of 34 million years, which places the formation in the Late Eocene Priabonian stage. At the time of description the holotype specimen, number 3976 was deposited in the Museum of Comparative Zoology paleontology collections at Harvard University. Placement of the group has changed several times, with Nepherocerus Metanephrocerus Priabona and Protonephrocerus being placed in the pipunculid subfamily Nephrocerinae from 1948 until 2014. The placement of the tribe Protonephrocerini, containing Metanephrocerus and Protonephrocerus, was challenged in 2014 by Kehlmaier, Dierick and Skevington who suggested inclusion of the genera made Nephrocerinae paraphyletic. As such they elevated the tribe Protonephrocerini to the subfamily rank as Protonephrocerinae, leaving only Nephrocerus and Priabona in Nephrocerinae. The species was originally placed into the genus Protonephrocerus by Frank M. Carpenter and F.M. Hull with their type description in 1939. The species was moved in 2014, based on a redescription of the type specimen, to the new genus Priabona. The generic epithet \\"Priabona\\" is taken from Priabonian, the age of the Florissant Formation.  Description  P. florissantius has a body length of , with the details of the head mostly indistinct. There appears to be a notch between the eyes which runs halfway up the rear-side of the head capsule. The wings of the holotype are and hyaline overall, with a darkening of the pterostigma. The femurs of P. florissantius are unique in that they have several darkened spines on the undersides and which have setae on the front and upper sides, a feature absent in Nephrocerus.

As a musician, he was part of a new wave of mid-to-late 1960s French singer-songwriters, cited in comparable in some ways to Bob Dylan or Donovan, but also evidencing some of the harder-edged garage rock style similar to The Rolling Stones, The Animals, and Them, and achieving some measure of pop stardom. Beginning in the 1970s, he de-emphasized his musical endeavors (although he still writes and performs on occasion) in favor of a second career as a solo sailor and adventurer, which he has documented with many books and films. Early life From a Corsican family, Antoine was born on June 4, 1944, in Toamasina in Madagascar, then part of the French colonial empire for which his father was working. As a child he lived in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Marseille, and French Cameroons, returning to Metropolitan France for good in 1958. He was graduated from the Lyc√©e Champollion in Grenoble, excelling in advanced mathematics. A 1964 stay in the United States exposed Antoine to the burgeoning folk music revival on the American east coast. He enrolled as an engineering student in the √âcole Centrale Paris (from which he was graduated in 1966), but also began traveling about, playing his guitar and singing in bistros for pocket money. He also began writing songs. Garage rock icon and later musical career Signing with the Disques Vogue record label in 1965, Antoine released his first single \\"European Highway Number 4\\" (). In 1966 he released the EP Antoine's Fever Dreams () against the advice of his producer Christian Fechner and Vogue management. The record, with protest songs and exhibiting a garage band style in sharp contrast to the y√©-y√© style then in vogue, resounded with the less carefree and more militant spirit growing among French youth (this was two years before the May 1968 events in France). Along with figures such as Jacques Dutronc and Michel Polnareff (and to some degree Ronnie Bird and Herbert Leonard), Antoine thus led a new wave in French music. The title song was Antoine's biggest hit. Antoine's first full LP album was Antoine Meets the Problems (), made with the existing band les Probl√®mes (who soon renamed themselves les Charlots and went on to long-term success, particularly in film). Some of the songs on the album were of Antoine and les Probl√®mes playing together, but many were by Antoine alone or les Probl√®mes alone, and many were previously released singles. One song on the album which became particularly associated with Antoine was \\"I'll Say What I Think and I'll Live How I Want\\" () Having achieved some mainstream popularity, Antoine fell more under the control of his producer, being given songs he did not always like and being pressured to change his musical style and even appearance. A 1968 song \\"Take Me Home\\" () suggested his disillusionment with being a musician, even as his popularity was spreading to Italy. In 1971, he recorded a single with celebrity television host Dani√®le Gilbert, \\"'Scuse Me, Mister Antoine\\" () and in 1973 he appeared in the revival of the 1921 operetta D√©d√©, singing alongside Georgette Plana. Although he has never stopped writing and performing music, in 1974 he shifted his focus to the sea and to other pursuits. =Rivalry with Johnny Hallyday= In \\"Antoine's Fever Dreams\\" (the title song to the EP of the same name), Antoine, who represented with his emblematic long hair and flowered shirts a new look and new sound, made fun of Johnny Hallyday (the \\"French Elvis\\", a pioneer and icon of French rock and roll, but outdated in Antoine's eyes): \\"Things should keep on changing / The world would be much more fun / We'd see airplanes in the subway corridors / And Johnny Hallyday in a Circus Medrano zoo cage\\". Hallyday responded with an answer song \\"Long Hair and Short Ideas\\" () (\\"If words were sufficient to make things so / Then he, with his long hair, and sitting on his hands / Would indeed have me locked in a cage...\\") and the two commenced a back-and-forth rivalry which redounded to the publicity benefit of both (Hallyday's song was a hit and helped revivify his career) and which continued in various songs and other forms into the 21st century (for instance, with each appearing in TV advertising for competing optician chains in the 2000s). Sailor In 1969 Antoine discovered sailing by chance, after renting a house on the French Riviera which included a dinghy. In October 1974, Antoine embarked on the life of a sailor and adventurer. He set out on the 14-meter steel schooner Om, sailing alone 17,000 miles and calling on Atlantic ports such as Nouadhibou, Rio de Janeiro, St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha, and Cayenne, until 1980. From 1981 to 1989, Antoine sailed in the Atlantic and Pacific in the 10-meter aluminum sloop Voyage, and since 1989 he has sailed in the 12.5-meter catamaran Banana Split. Antoine published his first book of his adventures, Globedrifter () in 1977; several more have followed, including his book on distance navigation Setting Sail () Antoine has made films of his voyages, and has appeared on radio and television describing his adventures, as well published various books. He continues to write new songs (such as \\"Hands Off The Sea\\" ()) and give occasional concerts. He has lectured at conferences sponsored by World Knowledge (), the large French conference organization. When not at sea or traveling he lives with his long-term companion Francette in Paris or at a farm in Auvergne he bought with his early pop-star royalties.

It is classified in Section Ganymedes. It is native to Spain. Taxonomy Opinions vary as the status of this taxon. Zonnefeld (2208) discusses its status, believing both on genetic information and morphology and distribution that it is a separate species from Narcissus triandrus. For instance the leaf width at 2mm is much smaller. While Webb (1980) and Barra Lazaro (2000) consider it a variety or subspecies of the type species of the section (N. triandrus). he is supported in this by both Dorda and Fernandez Casas (1989) and Perez-Barrales et al. (2006). However officially according to the World Checklist and The Plant List it is considered Narcissus cernuus.

Washington Department of Ecology, 511 U.S. 700 (1994), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court that interpreted section 401 of the Clean Water Act. The case involved an application by the Jefferson County Public Utility District and Tacoma City Light in northwestern Washington to build a hydropower facility on the Dosewallips River, first proposed in 1982 and known as the \\"Elkhorn Dam\\" project. The Washington State Department of Ecology issued a certification to the project in 1986 that imposed minimum water flow requirements to protect species of salmon and steelhead under the federal Clean Water Act. Tacoma City Light argued that the dam project would only need to adhere to minimum flow standards set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), who license dams. Environmentalist groups argued that the FERC was insensitive to recreation and protection of salmon and steelhead and asked the state to enforce its minimum flow standards. The Washington State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state Department of Ecology on April 1, 1993. The case was taken to the United States Supreme Court the following year, where the court ruled 7‚Äì2 in favor of the state. Background In 1982, the Jefferson County Public Utility District (also known as PUD No. 1), in conjunction with Tacoma City Light, proposed the construction of a 10.4-megawatt hydroelectric dam on the Dosewallips River, near the Elkhorn Campground. The Dosewallips River, a glacier-fed stream that originates in the Olympic Mountains and empties into Hood Canal, passes through Olympic National Park and Olympic National Forest. The river, described as being in \\"pristine condition\\", supports populations of salmon, steelhead and trout native to the area. The Jefferson County PUD had looked to damming the Dosewallips River to provide hydroelectricity as well as drinking water to support long-term population growth. Tacoma and Jefferson applied for a water quality certificate from the State of Washington in 1983 as part of requirements outlined by section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act; the certificate came in addition to a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) before beginning construction. After a two-year environmental study by Tacoma, Jefferson PUD and the state departments of Ecology, Fisheries and Wildlife, and the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, the dam was proposed to maintain minimum in-stream flows of per second, depending on the month. The Washington State Department of Ecology issued the section 401 certificate in 1986, with a condition to maintain minimum in- stream flows of per second. Tacoma and Jefferson appealed the in-stream flows requirement to the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board (PCHB), who initially ruled in 1987 that the Department of Ecology had acted within its authority in placing the requirements in order to preserve the fisheries of the Dosewallips River. At a second hearing, the PCHB considered an argument from Tacoma and Jefferson alleging that the Department of Ecology had exceeded its authority in imposing the in-stream flows requirement to enhance the fishery, rather than maintain and preserve it. As a result, the flow rates were reversed by the board, leading to a cross-appeal in the Thurston County Superior Court. The court ruled in 1991 that the Department of Ecology had the authority to require an enhancement of the Dosewallips fisheries and re- instated their proposed flow rates. The case was heard by the Washington Supreme Court in 1993. The court ruled in favor of the Department of Ecology, finding that the department intended to preserve, not enhance, the Dosewallips fisheries and that the PCHB's findings were erroneous. The court also concluded that the Department of Ecology's permit was valid and was not preempted by the Federal Power Act and the FERC license. Opinion of the Court Justice O'Connor authored the opinion of the Court. Subsequent developments Tacoma City Light withdrew its application for the project in April 1995 and announced the following month that it would abandon plans to build the dam.

The notion of a ringed topos has applications to deformation theory in algebraic geometry (cf. cotangent complex) and the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics. In the latter subject, a Bohr topos is a ringed topos that plays the role of a quantum phase space. The definition of a topos-version of a \\"locally ringed space\\" is not straightforward, as the meaning of \\"local\\" in this context is not obvious. One can introduce the notion of a locally ringed topos by introducing a sort of geometric conditions of local rings (see SGA4, Expos√© IV, Exercise 13.9), which is equivalent to saying that all the stalks of the structure ring object are local rings when there are enough points.  Morphisms  A morphism (T, \\\\mathcal{O}_T) \\\\to (T', \\\\mathcal{O}_{T'}) of ringed topoi is a pair consisting of a topos morphism f: T \\\\to T' and a ring homomorphism \\\\mathcal{O}_{T'} \\\\to f_*\\\\mathcal{O}_T. If one replaces a \\"topos\\" by an ‚àû-topos, then one gets the notion of a ringed ‚àû-topos.  Examples  = Ringed topos of a topological space = One of the key motivating examples of a ringed topos comes from topology. Consider the site \\\\text{Open}(X) of a topological space X, and the sheaf of continuous functions > C^0_X: \\\\text{Open}(X)^{op} \\\\to \\\\text{CRing} sending an object U \\\\in \\\\text{Open}(X), an open subset of X, to the ring of continuous functions C^0_X(U) on U. Then, the pair (\\\\text{Sh}(\\\\text{Open}(X)),C^0_X) forms a ringed topos. Note this can be generalized to any ringed space (X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X) where > \\\\mathcal{O}_X : \\\\text{Open}(X)^{op} \\\\to \\\\text{Rings} so the pair (\\\\text{Sh}(\\\\text{Open}(X)),\\\\mathcal{O}_X) is a ringed topos. = Ringed topos of a scheme = Another key example is the ringed topos associated to a scheme (X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X), which is again the ringed topos associated to the underlying locally ringed space.  Relation with functor of points  Recall that the functor of points view of scheme theory defines a scheme X as a functor X:\\\\text{CAlg} \\\\to \\\\text{Sets} which satisfies a sheaf condition and gluing condition. That is, for any open cover \\\\text{Spec}(R_{f_i}) \\\\to \\\\text{Spec}(R) of affine schemes, there is the following exact sequence > X(R) \\\\to \\\\prod X(R_{f_i}) \\\\rightrightarrows \\\\prod X(R_{f_if_j}) Also, there must exist open affine subfunctors > U_i = \\\\text{Spec}(A_i) = \\\\text{Hom}_{\\\\text{CAlg}}(A_i,-) covering X, meaning for any \\\\xi \\\\in X(R), there is a \\\\xi_{U_i} \\\\in U_i(R). Then, there is a topos associated to X whose underlying site is the site of open subfunctors. This site is isomorphic to the site associated to the underlying topological space of the ringed space corresponding to the scheme. Then, topos theory gives a way to construct scheme theory without having to use locally ringed spaces using the associated locally ringed topos. = Ringed topos of sets = The category of sets is equivalent to the category of sheaves on the category with one object and only the identity morphism, so \\\\text{Sh}(*) \\\\cong \\\\text{Sets}. Then, given any ring A, there is an associated sheaf \\\\text{Hom}_{Sets}(-, A): \\\\text{Sets}^{op} \\\\to \\\\text{Rings}. This can be used to find toy examples of morphisms of ringed topoi.

In other words, a categorical ring is obtained by replacing the underlying set of a ring by a category. For example, given a ring R, let C be a category whose objects are the elements of the set R and whose morphisms are only the identity morphisms. Then C is a categorical ring. But the point is that one can also consider the situation in which an element of R comes with a \\"nontrivial automorphism\\" (cf. Lurie).

J. Perelman, Laura Perelman and Marion Parsonnet. The film stars Lew Ayres, Rita Johnson, Lloyd Nolan, Virginia Grey, Leon Errol and Nat Pendleton. The film was released on August 16, 1940, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Mary Blake insists that mild-mannered insurance salesman Henry Twinkle demand a raise if they intend to get married. Henry earns praise and a raise from his boss when he sells a valuable policy to a man named Gus Fender. Fender turns out to be a gangster with a huge reward for anyone who brings him in, dead or alive. Henry's furious boss orders him to personally assure Fender does not end up dead. Fender and his moll, Lila Hanley, however, dupe Henry into a scheme in which they will end up with the reward money themselves. Henry foolishly tries to pay them with a check. Mary, who quit her job after Henry's raise, bemoans his acceptance of a worthless stock and even sues him to get back money she feels she's got coming. The stock ends up valuable after all and Henry ends up with $150,000 in hand. He naively gives Fender a fistful of cash, which then accidentally gets burned into ashes.

It is a common coral in shallow water in the Indo-Pacific region. Distribution and habitat Montipora aequituberculata Montipora aequituberculata is native to the Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, through the Indian Ocean to Japan, the East China Sea, Australia and the west and central Pacific. It is found on the upper parts of reef slopes where it may be the most predominant species. Biology Montipora aequituberculata is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its soft tissues. These photosynthetic organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the planktonic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps. Status Like other reef corals, Montipora aequituberculata is threatened by habitat destruction. Rising sea temperatures can cause \\"bleaching\\" because the symbiotic zooxanthellae are expelled from the coral's tissues, leaving the coral colorless. The bleaching event results in very high coral mortality soon after. Stressed corals are more susceptible to disease. Other threats are posed by El Nino events, ocean acidification which tends to dissolve the coral skeleton, trawling and other fishing activities, pollution and sedimentation. This is a common species in shallow reef environments and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Little is known about his life, but Chinese legends attribute to him the ability to understand birds' language. Life Gongye Chang's years of birth and death are unknown. The Records of the Grand Historian says he was a native of the State of Qi, but according to Kong Anguo and others, he was from the State of Lu. According to the Analects, Gongye Chang was once imprisoned for an unidentified crime. However, Confucius believed he was innocent, and married his daughter to him. Although the exact nature of his offence is not known, Confucius' marriage of his daughter to him despite the strong stigma attached to criminals in the Zhou dynasty demonstrates Confucius' adherence to moral reason and his independence from arbitrary social conventions. Legend Little is known about Gongye Chang's life, but he became the subject of a variety of later Chinese legends and folklore, and was said to be able to understand the language of animals and birds. In one story, which explains why he was imprisoned, he overheard a number of birds discussing the location of a murder victim. His knowledge of the body led him to be arrested for the person's murder, but he was released after demonstrating his supernatural powers. The story appeared in the book Lunshi (Ë´ñÈáã), and became widely known. Tang dynasty poets Shen Quanqi and Bai Juyi both made references to Gongye Chang's story in their poems. Honours In Confucian temples, Gongye Chang's spirit tablet is placed in the outer court, beyond those of the Four Assessors and Twelve Wise Ones, and next to that of Fu Buqi.

There are viruses that are similar to CYLV which affect hogweed and beet roots as well.Adams, I. P., Skelton, A., Macarthur, R., Hodges, T., Hinds, H., Flint, L., Nath, P. D., Boonham, N., & Fox, A. (2014). Carrot yellow leaf virus is associated with carrot internal necrosis. PLOS ONE, 9(11), 1-10. =Major patterns of infection= There have been sporadic plagues of CYLV occurring in many countries across the world, most notably the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. Aphids are the main form of transmission. These insects spread the virus from one carrot patch to another. Once the virus infects the carrot, necrosis starts in the roots. Historical perspectives =Discovery= The carrot yellow-leaf virus was first isolated in Japanese carrots that had yellowing leaves. Using electron microscopy, the virus particle was found to be 1.6006 X 1012 nm long with a 3.7-nm helical pitch. These are characteristics from the genus Closterovirus. There was a suspected case found in the Netherlands that was originally going to be studied because it seemed similar to CYLV, but it ended up having a different host range. =Retrospective analysis= There was an attempt to inoculate another carrot with the sap of an infected carrot, but this was unsuccessful; the carrot did not become immune. Attempts to grow a virus in a carrot by mechanically injecting the virus into the carrot rather than naturally infecting it through an aphid has failed to produce more virus. It may be possible to use a PCR with degenerate primers to find DNA from multiple pathogens of the same genus of CYLV, but this will not detect new pathogens, so CYLV cannot be specifically isolated from the PCR amplified DNA. =Significant milestones= There have been major outbreaks in the United Kingdom causing economic damage for 20 years. There have currently been no treatments developed. At this point, virologists are simply trying to fully diagnose the infection. =Current and future study and treatment= Currently, virologists are working on using high-throughput sequencing to identify novel virus genomes from a sample. This can potentially be used for diagnosis of CYLV. There is still a need to modify Koch‚Äôs postulates to establish a cause and effect relationship between CYLV and root necrosis. This requires future experimentation using an agricultural environment to accurately mediate the transmission of the virus. A harvested virus cannot simply be placed into a healthy host and have the expected symptoms without the natural environment. Right now, CYLV is being prevented more than treated since there are no viable treatment methods yet. One method of prevention is to remove carrots with yellowing leaves so that they do not infect other carrots in the patch. Using pesticides to kill aphids or nets to trap them will also limit the spread of the virus to other patches. Structure and classification =ICTV/Baltimore classification= For classifying the Carrot yellow-leaf virus, the Baltimore system and the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses system classifies this virus as closteroviridae, or a closterovirus. =Genome type= The +ssRNA genome is 15.5 to 19.3 kb, contains a 3‚Äô terminus, and does not have a poly(A) tract. The 5‚Äô terminus commonly has a methylated nucleotide cap. The virus genome is 1250-2200 nm in length and 10-13 nm in diameter.\\"ViralZone: Closterovirus\\". ViralZone: Closterovirus. SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 2008. Web. 10 Nov. 2014. =Replication= In order to replicate, the carrot yellow leaf virus physically penetrates into the host cell. The virus then uncoates its capsid proteins and releases genomic +ssRNA into the host cytoplasm. The viral +ssRNA is translated into a processed ORF1 polyprotein to be replicated into viral proteins The carrot yellow leaf virus dsRNA genome is synthesized from the genomic ssRNA(+) within the host. The dsRNA genome is transcribed to produce new viral mRNAs/new ssRNA(+) genomes. Translation using host cell machinery produces new viral components to be assembled. Viral movement proteins mediate virion cell-to-cell transfer.Fraenkel-Conrat, Heinz, Paul C. Kimball, and Jay A. Levy. \\"52 Pg.\\" Virology. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1988. N. pag. Print. virion structure =Capsid components= The capsid for Carrot yellow- leaf virus possess a helical formation. The virion genomic +ssRNA, being a single-stranded plant virus genome, is covered in major capsid proteins, while the tail of virus is coated in minor capsid proteins. =Viral envelope= This virus is non-enveloped, being a member of the closteroviridae virus family. CYLV genome structure =Variation/subtypes= Carrot yellow-leaf virus is a variant of beet yellow virus. Both pose similar symptoms and genome structure as well as similar virion proteins.Dimmock, Nigel J., Andrew J. Easton, and Keith N. Leppard. Introduction to Modern Virology. 5th ed.

Epidemiology =Role in plant disease= The leaves of carrots infected with the CYLV virus become yellowish and the internal root core displays necrosis, which can extend from crown to tip. Some carrots can present necrosis just on the surface. The infection affects mainly the vascular tissue in carrots that circulates sugars and other metabolites (phloem). =Infection statistics= The first infection by the CYLV was reported in Japan in the carrot species Daucus carota in 1976.Yamashita S, Ohki S, Doi Y, Yora K (1976) Identification of two viruses associated with the carrot yellow leaf syndrome. Annual Phytopathology Society of Japan 42: 382‚Äì383. The first occurrence reported in Europe of infection in carrots by CYLV was in 1985.Menzel, W., Goetz, R., Lesemann, D. E., & Vetten, H. J. (2009). Molecular characterization of a closterovirus from carrot and its identification as a German isolate of carrot yellow leaf virus. Archives of Virology, 154(8), 1343-1347. In 2009, more than 10% of the yield in the United Kingdom was infected by the carrot yellow leaf virus. It is believed that this virus is the main causal pathogen of carrot necrosis and its removal would reduce the incidence of necrosis in carrots by 96%. Aphid of the genus Cavariella. This aphid is known as the vector of the carrot yellow leaf virus (CYLV). =Transmission= The transmission of the CYLV occurs by mechanical inoculation of the plant by aphids of the genus Cavariella, popularly known as ‚Äúplant lice‚Äù. The vector transmits the virus while feeding the host organic matter contained in the phloem.Karasev, A. (2002). Genetic diversity and evolution of Closteroviruses. Annual Review of Phytopathology, 38, 293-324. There is a minimum latent period of 7‚Äì18 hours after the vector has acquired the virus. The viruses remain circulative in the vector, but are not transmitted to their progeny insects, which means that the viral infection occurs horizontally. In addition, it was observed the vectors take 24 hours to be able to continue to transmit the viruses.Elnagar, S. & Murant, A. F. (1978). Relations of carrot red leaf and carrot mottle viruses with their aphid vector, Cavariella aegopodii. Ann. Appl. Biol., 89, 231-244. =Control/prevention/treatment= Drugs have not been developed for the treatment of the symptoms of CYLV. Antivirals to control or eliminate the viral infection have not been developed.HDC: FV 382b - Carrots: The Epidemiology of Carrot yellow leaf virus (CYLV) - the development of a decision support system for the management of carrot viruses in the UK. Retrieved November 10, 2014 from http://www.hdc.org.uk/project/carrots- epidemiology-carrot-yellow-leaf-virus-cylv-development-decision-support-system The only method available is the prevention of the virus by removal of the infected carrots which express some symptoms (yellow leaves, for example), in order to avoid the contamination of healthy carrots in the patch. Moreover, another prevention method corresponds to the use of insecticides, such as imidacloprid ('Confidor') and a mixture of lambda-cyhalothrin and pirimicarb ('Okapi'), which have been effective to control the vector of the virus and, consequently, to prevent the infection of the carrots.Vercruysse, P., Meert, F., Tirry, L., & H√∂fte, M. (2000). Evaluation of insecticides for control of Cavariella aegopodii and carrot motley dwarf disease in parsley. Journal Mededelingen - Faculteit Landbouwkundige en Toegepaste Biologische Wetenschappen, Universiteit Gent, 65 (1), 9-18. Infectious Cycle Cross section of a carrot root. Carrot Yellow-leaf virus has tropism for Phloem cells, the same location where Aphids feed. =Routes of entry= CYLV is transmitted by aphids, also known as plant lice. The family of Aphids or Aphididae belongs to the order Homoptera, suborder Sternorrhyncha. The insects feed on conductive tissue (phloem),Agranovsky, A., Lesemann, D. (2002). Closterovirus. Springer Index of Viruses, 263-243. which is responsible for transport of nutrients throughout the plant. The virus is transmitted by the aphid when it feeds on the carrot; it is transmitted horizontally, not vertically. This means a pregnant aphid does not transmit the virus to the offspring, and the virus is not transmitted after molting. =Major virulence factors= There is no research specifically on the cytopathic effect of CYLV, however there is a general pattern in the family Closteroviridae that might apply to this particular virus. Closteroviruses are usually phloem-limited, but some groups might infect parenchyma and mesophyll cells; therefore, closteroviruses are more often described simply as \\"phloem-associated\\" with regard to tissue tropism. That is why symptoms are associated with phloem; the cytopathology is mainly caused by vesicles containing virus particles, which is also a form of diagnosis. Another important viral mechanism is the capacity to escape the host's immune system. In plants, a common strategy is the use of interference RNA or RNAi, which are short sequences homologous to the viral genome. When these short sequences bind to the genome, they prevent transcription into dsDNA, therefore controlling the infection. Some viruses have developed proteins called Silencing Suppressors in response to RNAi. The mechanism is unknown, but mutation in those proteins allow the plant to recover from the viral infection and prevents systemic infections.Dawson, W. et al. (2002). Citrustristezavirus host-interactions. Frontiers in Microbiology, 4(88), 1-10. =Host cell recognition, viral attachment and entry= The virus cell specificity depends more on the vector than on the virus itself. There are some hypotheses affirming that CYLF evolved to infect phloem cells because they are the most common feeding site for the vectors. During feeding, aphids transmit the virus into phloem cells. However, in order to spread the infection, viruses need to move from one cell to another. Using Citrus tristeza virus as an example of closterovirus, it is possible to observe two different types of movement: one from adjacent cells and one from long distance. In order to penetrate the thick cell wall, closteroviruses have specific movement proteins encoded in their genome, along with mechanisms to use host proteins to facilitate transport. One of the most important proteins for cell-to-cell movement is a Hsp70 homolog, or Hsp70h; it has this name because it is one of the heat shock proteins with a weight of 70kDa. =Viral replication, transcription, translation= Closteroviruses have a (+)ssRNA genome, so it needs to first be transcribed into dsDNA before translation. Replication also involves formation of subgenomic RNA.Dolja, V., Hagiwara, Y., Peremyslov, V. (1998). Genes Required for Replication of the 15.5-Kilobase RNA Genome of a Plant Closterovirus, Journal of Virology, 72(7), 5870-5876. Replication happens in vesicles known as viral factories. Closteroviruses can have up to 10 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in their genome that encode several enzymes, like RNA polymerase, methyltransferase, RNA helicase, and papain-like protease (L-pro). L-pro has an essential role in replication. The dsRNA is then used as a template for the replication of ssRNA which is then transcribed into mRNA and translated into viral proteins. Using Beet Yellow Virus as an example, it is possible to see that the virion is formed mainly by the major capsid protein. The virus has a short tail that is formed by the minor capsid protein. Cell mechanisms are used to translate these and all the other viral proteins. Model for hypothesis of cell movement between neighbour cells. CYLV virion particle assembles first, but it needs the \\"tail\\" and Hsp70h help to pass the channel. =Virion assembly and egress= The capsid proteins and ssRNA genome assemble and exit the cell. The major capsid protein is essential for virus assembly; mutations in the gene responsible for encoding it result in impairment of assembly. However, minor capsid protein is not essential for assembly nor genome protection. A virus with a mutated minor capsid protein could successfully assemble, but cell-to-cell movement is not possible. Therefore, the tail is essential for viral movement. Hsp70h, which was seen in cell-to-cell movement is also essential for viral movement because tail formation is only possible when Hsp70h is present. Cell movement is a process with three different stages:Alzhanova, D. (2001). Cell-to-cell movement and assembly of a plant closterovirus: roles for the capsid proteins and Hsp70 homolog. The EMBO Journal, 20(24), 6997-7007. * Hsp70h binds to the minor capsid protein tail and consequently it attaches to the major capsid protein virion * Hsp70h binds to the cell wall channel and drives the virus through it. This process needs ATP. * The tail disassembles when Hsp70h stays in the channel. Without the tail, the body is less stable and RNA is exposed into the neighbour cell cytoplasm; the viral genome has successfully infected another cell. Egress to neighbour cells and to cell matrix happens in a similar manner.

Eldorado Resorts acquired Caesars Entertainment Corporation and changed its own name to Caesars Entertainment on July 20, 2020. History The company traces its history back to the development of the Eldorado Hotel in Reno, which was opened on May 24, 1973 by a group of investors that included Don Carano and other members of the Carano family. On July 28, 1995, the Eldorado opened the adjacent Silver Legacy Resort Casino in partnership with Circus Circus Enterprises. The Eldorado companies were reorganized in 1996 as Eldorado Resorts LLC in connection with a $100-million bond offering. In 2005, the company took over the bankrupt Hollywood Casino Shreveport in Louisiana, buying a 76 percent stake in the property for $154 million. It was then rebranded as the Eldorado Casino Shreveport. In 2013, Eldorado agreed to combine with the publicly traded MTR Gaming Group in a reverse merger. The merger would add three racinos in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to Eldorado's portfolio. The transaction closed on September 19, 2014, creating Eldorado Resorts Inc. in its present form. Eldorado's existing owners held 50.2 percent of the combined company, and Gary Carano was appointed as its chairman and CEO. In November 2015, Eldorado bought Circus Circus Reno and the 50% stake in the Silver Legacy that it did not already own from MGM Resorts International for $73 million. In May 2017, Eldorado acquired Isle of Capri Casinos for $1.7 billion in cash, stock, and assumed debt, adding twelve casinos to its holdings. In August 2018, Eldorado bought the Grand Victoria Casino in Illinois for $328 million. Two months later, Eldorado acquired the operating business of Tropicana Entertainment for $640 million, adding seven casinos to its portfolio. Gaming and Leisure Properties simultaneously purchased the real estate of five of the casinos and leased them to Eldorado for a total of $88 million per year. Additionally, Eldorado paid $246 million for the real estate underlying Tropicana's Lumi√®re Place casino in Missouri. In early 2019, Eldorado sold Presque Isle Downs and the operations of Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin to Churchill Downs, Inc. for a total of $179 million. In March 2019, it was reported that Eldorado was discussing a merger with Caesars Entertainment. On June 23, 2019, Caesars accepted Eldorado's offer to purchase the company for $18 billion in stock and cash. Eldorado operated 26 assets compared to Caesars, which controlled 53. Eldorado would change its name to Caesars Entertainment after the completion of the acquisition, and the companies' loyalty programs would be combined under the Caesars Rewards brand. Eldorado's key executives would be retained. The deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020. With the Caesars acquisition pending, Eldorado sold three properties (Lady Luck Casino Caruthersville, Mountaineer Casino Racetrack and Resort and Isle Casino Cape Girardeau) to Vici Properties and Century Casinos for a total of $385 million, with Vici acquiring the real estate assets and Century acquiring the operating businesses. Eldorado also sold Lady Luck Casino Vicksburg and Isle of Capri Casino Kansas City to Twin River Worldwide Holdings for $230 million. The deals were intended to reduce Eldorado's debt level and avert potential antitrust issues in Missouri, where Eldorado and Caesars together owned 6 of the state's 13 casinos. In April 2020, Eldorado agreed to sell Eldorado Shreveport and the MontBleu casino in Lake Tahoe to Twin River.https://www.inquirer.com/news/ballys-atlantic-city-sale- acquisition-twin-river-caesars- vici-20200424.htmlhttps://www.kolotv.com/content/news/Eldorado-Resorts- selling-Montbleau-casino-at- Stateline-569929791.htmlhttps://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/eldorado-resorts-to- sell-tahoes-montbleu-louisiana-casino-for-155-million/ On June 26, 2020, the Federal Trade Commission approved Eldorado's acquisition of Caesars.https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/federal-trade- commission-clears-eldorado-caesars-deal-2061683/ The transaction was completed on July 20.

The Treaty of Paris (1303) ended the conflict. Aquitaine & Gascony Serious conflict was precipitated in 1293, when clashes between French and English seamen caused Philip IV of France to summon his vassal to Parlement. When Gascon castles occupied by the French as part of the settlement were not returned to the English on schedule, Edward I of England renounced his homage and prepared to fight for Aquitaine. The war that ensued (1294‚Äì1303) went in favour of Philip the Fair, whose armies thrust deep into Gascony. Flanders Edward retaliated by allying with Flanders and other northern princes. He launched a campaign in concert with the Count of Flanders in August 1297, but met defeat from a French force led by Robert II, Count of Artois, and during a truce from October 1297 to 1303 the rival monarchs reestablished the status quo ante.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, France ‚Äì Foreign relations The peace of 1303 carried all a potential for conflict, by returning the duchy to Edward in exchange for homage.The Origins of the Hundred Years War, History Today, John Maddicott, Published in Volume: 36 Issue: 5, 1986 A consequence of this first war was to be the chronic insubordination of Flanders. After the count's surrender and imprisonment, it was left to the Flemish burghers to revolt against the French garrisons, and the French knights suffered a terrible defeat at Courtrai in July 1302. Thereafter the tide turned. But it was only in 1305 that a settlement satisfactory to the king could be reached. Aftermath At a time when warfare was placing an unprecedented strain on royal resources, Gascony also supplied manpower. No English king, therefore, could afford to risk a French conquest of Gascony, for too much was at stake. The English Kings as Dukes of Aquitaine owed feudal allegiance to the French King and the conflicting claims of suzerainty and justice were a frequent source of disputes.Ginger M. Lee, \\"French War of 1294‚Äì1303\\", in Ronald H. Fritze and William Baxter Robison (eds.), Historical Dictionary of Late Medieval England, 1272‚Äì1485 (Greenwood, 2002), pp. 215‚Äì16 . Given the inconveniences of the feudal relationship it may seem surprising that no wider conflict grew out of the Gascon situation before the 1330s. Yet until that decade the tensions arising from the English position in Gascony were contained and controlled. The war marked a watershed in relations between the two powers.

It is a popular garden plant, and is widely available for cultivation as an ornamental. Description This herbaceous perennial bears mostly unbranched stems reaching up to 170 cm tall. The leaves are variable in shape and size. Those near the base have oval blades borne on petioles and those higher on the plant have shorter, narrower blades. The flower heads are solitary atop the stems and have arrays of small leaves around the bases. The heads are 2.5 to 3.5 cm wide. The somewhat rounded head is covered in layers of phyllaries with fringed tips and sometimes spines. The head contains many yellow florets. The fruit, including its pappus, can be well over one centimeter long. Biology In its native range in the Caucasus, this plant grows in mountain meadows. It is a summer-flowering subalpine species. It thrives as an introduced species in many types of moist temperate habitat, especially areas dominated by perennial herbs. It can grow in disturbed areas. Uses This is a well-known ornamental flowering plant. It has been a garden flower for over 200 years, being introduced to the United Kingdom and United States in the early 19th century. Thomas Jefferson obtained seeds from the nurseryman Bernard McMahon and planted them at Monticello. In gardens it can be placed at borders or corners, where it will form clumps. It is used as a cut flower for its large, rounded heads with long yellow florets, and it can be used as a decorative dried flower. This is the largest Centaurea in cultivation and is easily recognized. Ecology As the plant has been transported around the world for ornamental use it has taken hold as an introduced species in several areas. It is a casual garden escapee in parts of Europe and North America. It has only become a troublesome noxious weed in a few areas, notably Washington state in the United States, where it is prohibited to buy or sell the species. Its invasive nature is best seen in garden environments, where it is more aggressive than most other ornamental plants and can become a \\"garden thug\\".

El Ni√±o caused droughts across much of the country, which lowered reservoir levels at many of its principal hydroelectric dams and a further crisis within the state public services company, Interconexi√≥n El√©ctrica, S.A. (ISA). Causes El Ni√±o occurs when warm waters originating off the coast of Australia reach South American shores. This causes significant variation in marine climates and droughts and floods. The 1992 El Ni√±o, which produced droughts in Colombia, coincided with infrastructure problems within the nation's hydroelectric power facilities. Rationing The government under president C√©sar Gaviria opted to take action, introducing a rationing program. On March 2, 1992, the government announced scheduled power cuts, of up to nine hours in cities such as Bogot√° and up to 18 hours on the islands of San Andr√©s y Providencia. Public awareness campaigns were launched under the name \\"Cierre la llave\\" (\\"Turn Off the Tap\\"), hoping to measure how much water was being wasted. In the city of Cali, a decree was passed setting six days in prison as a penalty for heavy water users. =\\"Hora Gaviria\\"= As a further measure, Gaviria changed Colombia's time zone from UTC-5 to UTC-4, which was then the time zone of neighboring Venezuela, beginning on Saturday, May 2, 1992, at 1:00 am. The measure came to be known as \\"Hora Gaviria\\" (\\"Gaviria Time\\"). Of Colombia's 1,024 municipalities, 1,000 declined to change time zones and took months to come into effect. The time zone change was ended on February 7, 1993. Impacts One of two most popular telenovelas of 1992 in Colombia, En cuerpo ajeno, was moved from 8pm to 10pm on Cadena Uno, then a highly unusual timeslot for flagship novelas on Colombian television, so that more viewers could see it when they were not impacted by energy rationing (the blackouts in Bogot√° ended at 9 pm). The other popular telenovela, Sangre de Lobos, was already being broadcast at 10pm on Canal A. Caracol Radio created a program, La Luci√©rnaga (\\"The Firefly\\"), for the early evening hours when power cuts were in effect in many areas; as of 2015, the program remains on the air.

Blebbishields in turn fuse to each other and generate cancer stem cell spheres/cellular transformation, essentially shifting the balance of dying cells back towards survival. Human RT4 bladder cancer cells (RT4P) undergo apoptosis and subsequent blebbishield formation (Left panel: Schematic) by bleb-bleb fusion. Blebbishields in turn fuse to each other to form cancer stem cell spheres (Right panel:Photograph).

Cell Death Differ. 2013 Mar;20(3):382-95. Blebbishield formation Every cell type, especially cancer cells, are capable of undergoing apoptosis, a process in which the plasma membrane undergoes blebbing followed by orderly deconstruction of cells into apoptotic bodies. Cancer stem cells have the extraordinary ability to construct blebbishields from these apoptotic bodies by bleb-bleb fusion and form stem cell spheres/cellular transformation by sub-sequent blebbishield-blebbishield fusion.Jinesh GG, Kamat AM.

The involvement of membrane fusion was confirmed by inhibiting cholesterol using the cholesterol antagonist Filipin-III. Blebbishields and cancer stem cells Sphere forming cells widely display characteristics of tumorigenesis. Cells from blebbishield derived spheres are tumorigenic in nature, providing an important clue for tumorigenesis. Blebbishield emergency program is postulated to have the strong rationale for bladder cancer recurrence as it is a potential cause for multifocal/satellite bladder tumors.Goodwin Jinesh G, Willis DL, Kamat AM. Bladder cancer stem cells: biological and therapeutic perspectives. Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2014 Mar;9(2):89-101. The blebbishield derived cells exhibit strong drug resistance behavior and exhibit high sensitivity to Hoechst-33342 similar to side-population cells. Positive and negative regulators of blebbishield survival =Caspases= Caspases (Caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9) are found to have important roles in contributing the formation of blebbishields as well as sub-sequent cancer stem cell spheres. Caspase-3 plays a dual role where it is needed for induction of proper apoptosis: to activate Bax and Bak by cleavage to kill the cells and also needed for transformation from blebbishields.Jinesh GG, Molina JM, Huang L, Laing NM, Mills GB, Bar-Eli M & Kamat AM. Mitochondrial oligomers boost glycolysis in cancer stem cells to facilitate blebbishield-mediated transformation after apoptosis. Cell Death Discovery 2016 Feb;2: 20163. =VEGF signaling= VEGF signaling, especially VEGF-A to VEGFR2 signaling plays a commanding role during the transformation from blebbishields. VEGF signaling leads to IRES translation of N-Myc, which in concert with mitochondrial oligomers to boost glycolysis to power blebbishield formation and transformation from blebbishields. Lactic acid, a tumor derived metabolite, altering pH of tumor microenvironment enhances sphere formation from blebbishields positively regulating VEGF bioavailability. =Reactive oxygen species [ROS]= Reactive oxygen species plays a role in cellular transformation.

There are three recognised subspecies, and of one subspecies, the nominate, there are furthermore three varieties. It has been called pale knapweed in English. Vernacular names which have been recorded for this herb in Castilian Spanish are calcitrapa, cardo estrellado, centaura estrellada, garbanzos del cura, siempre nueva, siempre-nueva, and trapacaballos. Other local recorded names in Spanish are abreojos, abrepu√±os, amargosa, amargosilla, amargoso, ardolla, arzolla, cardo abrepu√±os, cardo de la arzolla, marbosilla, margosilla, piropo, planta para hemorroides and ra√≠z de la arzolla. In the Catalan language it is known as raspallera in the Valencian dialect. Taxonomy The species was first described in the modern Linnaean system by Linnaeus himself in the first edition of the Species Plantarum, published in 1753. It is presently placed in Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's section or subsection Phalolepis, along with Centaurea costae and the much more widely distributed C. deusta. In 2014 Hilpold et al. redefined the infrageneric taxa, classifying the traditional section Phalolepis in the subgenus Centaurea. Formerly the genus Centaurea was paraphyletic, because it was based on a species, C. centaurium -the type species, which was less related to the vast majority of other Centaurea than to species which were classified as belonging to other genera. In 2001 Werner Greuter solved this by moving the C. centaurium to the old, resurrected genus Rhaponticoides, conserving the name Centaurea for the majority of the other species, and electing C. paniculata to serve as the new type species. The infraspecific taxonomy has been rather volatile since the 1970s. A large number of former subspecies were recognised at one time or another. These were synonymised over the last century or so, or are now considered independent species. *Centaurea alba subsp. albanica (Hal√°csy) Dost√°l \\\\- a taxon from Albania. *Centaurea alba subsp. brunnea (Hal√°csy) Dost√°l *Centaurea alba subsp. ciliata (Font Quer ex O.Bol√≤s & Vigo) Greuter *Centaurea alba subsp. costae (Willk.)

Dost√°l *Centaurea alba subsp. tartesiana Talavera In his 1976 contribution in the Flora Europaea, Josef Dost√°l recognised subsp. albanica, subsp. brunnea, subsp. costae, subsp. deusta, subsp. formanekii, subsp. latronum and subsp. subciliaris. A lectotype was assigned by Salvador Talavera Lozano in 1984. The 2006 entry by Greuter in the Euro+Med Plantbase, based on a critical evaluation of the information from the Flora Europaea and the Med- Checklist, recognised the following infraspecific taxa: *Centaurea alba subsp. ciliata (O. Bol√≤s & Vigo) Greuter *Centaurea alba subsp. costae (Willk.) Dost√°l *Centaurea alba subsp. latronum (Pau) Dost√°l *Centaurea alba subsp. macrocephala (Pau) Talavera *Centaurea alba subsp. maluqueri (Font Quer) Molero & Vigo *Centaurea alba subsp. montsicciana (Pau & Font Quer) Romo *Centaurea alba subsp. strepens (Hoffmanns. & Link) Rocha Afonso *Centaurea alba subsp. tartesiana Talavera In 2008 the chromosomes of the different infraspecific taxa were investigated (karyotypy). All forms are 2n=18, but some differences between the taxa is seen in the chromosome morphology. The species was revised again in 2011. The 2014 entry in the Flora Ib√©rica follows this interpretation, although it only briefly mentions the three varieties. *Centaurea alba subsp. alba var. alba *Centaurea alba subsp. alba var. latronum (Pau) E.L√≥pez & Devesa *Centaurea alba subsp. alba var. macrocephala Pau *Centaurea alba subsp. aristifera (Pau ex Vicioso) E.L√≥pez & Devesa *Centaurea alba subsp. tartesiana Talavera The name C. deusta, a species more widely distributed in southern Italy, Greece and Turkey, has also historically been mistakenly said to occur in Spain, for example by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1838 in the Prodromus, in the 1865 issue of the Prodromus Florae Hispanicae of Heinrich Moritz Willkomm and Johan Lange, or by Carl Fredrik Nyman in his Conspectus Florae Europaeae (1878-1884). Dost√°l subsumed C. deusta in the Flora Europaea as C. alba subsp. deusta, and this taxon continued to be recognised as occurring in Spain in the 2001 entry in the Atlas de la flora del Pirineo Aragon√©s. =Hybrids= All of the species in the subgenus Centaurea appear to be able to hybridise freely with each other, and C. alba is no exception. In some, but not all, of the zones where the following taxa are in contact with C. alba, the following natural hybrids have been described as occurring. A cross of the nominate form with C. langei subsp. kheilii creates the hybrid C. √óbigerrensis, and with C. aristata, C. √ómatritensis is created. The variety latronum is also known to cross with C. calcitra, creating C. √óeliasii, recognisable by having its involucral bracts being tipped by a large and sharp spine. Another hybrid of the species has also recently (2009) been described from a 1988 collection in an industrial zone in the Province of Soria: Centaurea √ósoriana A.Segura ex Mateo & M.B.Crespo. The other parent of the hybrid is C. paniculata subsp. castellana. Lastly, in the Province of Soria relatively frequently transitional forms between the nominate variety alba with C. alba subsp. aristifera can be encountered. Description It is most similar to Centaurea costae, being mainly distinguished by the shape of the involucral bracts. C. costae has bilobed bracts. *Centaurea alba subsp. alba - *Centaurea alba subsp. aristifera - *Centaurea alba subsp. tartesiana - Distribution It only occurs on the Iberian Peninsula, being found at generally inland sites in central, central-north, central-western y southwestern parts of the Peninsula. In Spain it is found in the provinces of √Åvila, Badajoz, Burgos, C√°diz, C√°ceres, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, Huelva, Le√≥n, Madrid, Salamanca, Sevilla, Segovia, Soria, Toledo, Valladolid, Zaragoza and Zamora. In Portugal it occurs in Beira Baixa and Ribatejo Province. The different subspecies and varieties now recognised are largely not sympatric and have discreet geographical distributions. Two taxa have disjunct distributions, subsp. tartesiana to the south of the main distribution, and var. macrocephala further to the south of that, at the southernmost tip of continental Spain. For a long time it was believed to grow in northeast Algeria. According to L√≥pez this was originally based on a single sheet of a specimen in the personal herbarium of Georges Rouy, collected in Segovia in 1905, but apparently accidentally included in the section Plantes d‚ÄôAlg√©rie of the herbarium. It is one of five duplicates, one of which is the lectotype of the subspecies alba synonym Centaurea segoviensis. However, C. alba var. mauritanica had already been described by Jules Aim√© Battandier in his 1889 Flore de l'Alg√©rie as growing in Algeria, and an Algerian population of Centaurea was called as C. alba in the local flora until the 2000s, for example in the 1963 Nouvelle flore d'Alg√©rie, or the 1985 French collection on the Djebel Ich Ali near Tazoult in Batna wilaya. This population is now seen as a synonym of C. djebel-amouri, which was only recently described as a new species by Greuter in 2003; the previous name C. alba for the population is now attributed as \\"auct. Afr. N. non L.\\". Plants from Italy, France and possibly Albania have also historically been misidentified as C. alba. *Centaurea alba subsp. alba **C. alba subsp. alba var. alba - **C. alba subsp. alba var. latronum - **C. alba subsp. alba var. macrocephala - A disjunct population restricted to the southermost tip of Spain, from the mouth of the Guadalquivir emptying in the Gulf of C√°diz northeastwards into the Baetic Depression, entirely within the Province of C√°diz. *Centaurea alba subsp. aristifera - *Centaurea alba subsp. tartesiana - An endemic of the northwest corner of Andalusia. It occurs in the western part of the Sierra Morena mountain range, in the provinces of Huelva and Sevilla. Ecology It blooms from April to October. This species inhabits woodland clearings and the fringes of forests, especially pine forests, oak forests and melojares (Quercus pyrenaica forests), as well as growing in matorral, wasteland and gutters, slopes and wayside verge habitat along roads. It has been recorded growing at 3 to 2,000 metres in altitude. It prefers somewhat fertile soils, or not excessively fertilised, which can be acidic to alkaline. It is usually found growing in rocky, large-grained soil, very often calcarous mixed with silicates. The macrocephala variety occurs in matorral habitats on substrates derived from calcarenite and limestone. The tartesiana subspecies occurs in slate-based soils and marl. Conservation In 1992 two subspecies, subsp. heldreichii and subsp. princeps, were designated as 'priority species' under Annex II of the Habitats Directive of the European Community (which was reformed as the European Union the following year). This designation was meant to serve as the basis for Spain to declare which areas in which it occurs were 'Special Areas of Conservation' -which were to form the backbone of the Natura 2000 network, but only if these areas include one of the number of habitats listed in Annex I of the directive. Neither subspecies are still recognised. In 2005 the flora of Andalusia was assessed for the Lista roja de la flora vascular de Andaluc√≠a, with two subspecies, subsp. tartesiana and subsp. macrocephala, being included in the list. These two taxa were assessed as 'data deficient', but were included because they have restricted distributions and the authors thought that they might be threatened, or at least impacted, by changes in agriculture.

Etymology  The name combines words from three languages: agop in Sungai language means \\"cave\\", batu is the Malay word for \\"rock\\", while ' comes from the Cebuano language (carrying the same meaning as in the Sungai language) where it means \\"to go to sleep\\" referring to the resting place of the dead.  History  The wooden coffins. Several wooden coffins in the upper cave. The caves were used 500 to 900 years ago as a burial place with about 125 carved wooden coffins inside. It was divided into three main caves, namely Agop Sawat (upper cave), Agop Lintanga (middle cave) and Agop Suriba (lower cave). The caves at Agop Sawat and Lintanga contained more than 125 ancient log coffins. All coffins inside the caves were made from belian (Eusideroxylon zwageri) hardwood, and decorated with carvings of buffalo head, crocodile, house lizard and snake. The carvings reflect the myths and legends of the Kinabatangan people. For example, a crocodile is related to death and the power darkness while the bugang bird, dog, rooster and deer were friends of their heroes. The coffins resemble different animals associated to the beliefs of the Orang Sungai but it has also been said that they are the coffins of the Chinese who once settled in the area as Chinese artefacts were found among the remains. It is believed that this type of funeral culture was brought by traders from Mainland China and Indochina to northern Borneo, since similar wooden coffins were also discovered in these countries. Researchers assumes that about 2,000 such wooden coffins are distributed in the Kinabatangan Valley. Other sites are located in Ulu Segama, Lahad Datu and Tawau. The cave was discovered in 1984 through an expedition led by P Brietag, the manager of tobacco estate in Batu Putih of Kinabatangan together with researcher Barbara Harrisson of Sarawak State Museum and staffs of the Sabah Museum. Since 6 July 1996, the caves are part of the Sabah Museum, which is responsible for maintenance and upkeep the ancillary facilities such as toilets, staircase buildings, office buildings and overnight cabins except for the scientific support of the caves.

Notable events =Dra≈æen Petroviƒá's 112-point game= The first week of fixtures on 5 October 1985 included a game in Zagreb at Dom Sportova's small hall between Cibona and visiting Smelt Olimpija ‚Äì a contest that would go down in history for Dra≈æen Petroviƒá's Yugoslav Basketball League single-game scoring record as well as the strange circumstance that allowed it to happen. The visiting team failed to fulfill their player registration administrative obligations in time ‚Äì Olimpija general manager Radovan Lorbek was reportedly late with submitting a registration letter to the Yugoslav Basketball Federation (KSJ) headquarters in Belgrade ‚Äì rendering their entire first team roster ineligible for the regular season opening game and forcing them to field players from their youth system. Sending out juniors (age 18 and under) would've normally been the first option; however, since Olimpija had no junior team within their youth system that year, they had to go to an even younger age group ‚Äì making do with cadets (16 and under). In the end, the team they took to Zagreb consisted of players born in 1968 and younger, including Igor ƒêuroviƒá, Matja≈æ Strmole, Jo≈æe Maƒçek, Dag Kralj, Tine Erjavec, Jure Zorƒçiƒç, Gregor Stra≈æi≈°ƒçar, Andrej Novina, and Tine Merzelj. Cibona for their part decided to send out a mixed roster consisting of players from their youth system plus their twenty-one-year-old superstar Dra≈æen Petroviƒá who used the opportunity of playing against inferior opposition to shatter Radivoj Koraƒá's single-game Yugoslav League scoring record from 1962 when Koraƒá scored 74 points for OKK Beograd versus Mladost Zagreb. In a 158‚Äì77 blowout in front of 2,000 people against the hapless Ljubljana team, Petroviƒá scored 112 points on 40 for 60 field goal shooting that included 10 for 20 three-point shooting. He did so despite reportedly announcing his intention of leaving the floor once he reached Koraƒá's 74 points. Petroviƒá was one of only five Cibona players to get on the score sheet that day, the other four were eighteen-year-old Dra≈æen Anzuloviƒá with 16 points, eighteen-year-old Vladimir Rizman with 14, nineteen- year-old Ivo Nakiƒá with 12, and Ivan ≈†o≈°tarec with 4. =Cibona's 20-game winning streak= Cibona dominated the regular season with only a single loss in the entire campaign, thus equaling the feat that had previously been managed only twice in Yugoslav League history ‚Äî Zadar in 1974‚Äì75 and Crvena Zvezda in 1949. Behind young Dra≈æen Petroviƒá's scoring exploits (his regular- season scoring average was 43.3 points per game), the Zagreb club opened the league campaign with twenty straight wins before finally losing, 102‚Äì100, away to ≈†ibenka (Petroviƒá's old team) in the second last game of the regular season ‚Äî a contest in which Petroviƒá recorded 52 points, but ≈†ibenka still eked out a win led by Predrag ≈†ariƒá who scored 36 points. =Buduƒánost's surprise success= Buduƒánost was the season's biggest surprise package. Playing only its 6th season in the country's top-flight basketball league, the unfancied side from Titograd that had never had a positive season record (more wins than losses) in its previous five seasons was now nearly unbeatable at home, losing only one game in front of its home fans ‚Äî against powerful Cibona. Led by veterans Du≈°ko Ivanoviƒá (28.5 ppg season average), Dragan Ivanoviƒá, Nikola Antiƒá, Milatoviƒá, and Jadran Vujaƒçiƒá, the team also received a great contribution from its rising star ≈Ωarko Paspalj who turned 20 years of age over the course of the season.

Still, the visitors from Zadar could find some comfort in their defensive play due to managing to limit Cibona to 84 points ‚Äî well below 116.8 points per game Cibona had been scoring in their prior six games of the 1986 Yugoslav League playoffs. Game 2: Zadar vs Cibona 84-73 Zadar won game two on its home court at Jazine, having led comfortably throughout the entire contest (halftime score was 42-30). Receiving balanced scoring from its roster ‚Äî Petar Popoviƒá and Veljko Petranoviƒá with 15 points each, Ante Matuloviƒá with 14, Dra≈æenko Bla≈æeviƒá 12, Darko Pahliƒá 11, and Ivica Obad 10 ‚Äî Zadar's win was never in question. Cibona's best player Dra≈æen Petroviƒá didn't appear in game two somewhat controversially with the official reason provided by the club that he got injured during warm-up right before the game. There has been rife speculation after the game as well as in the years and decades since in the Yugoslav press and public, that, having been so convinced of their superiority over Zadar, Cibona essentially threw game two because they wanted to celebrate the Yugoslav league title in front of their fans at home in game three. Game 3: Cibona vs Zadar 110-111 2OT With the best-of- three series tied at one apiece, the deciding game 3 was played on Cibona's home court, Dom Sportova, on Saturday, 26 April 1986. Supported by over 10,000 fans, despite plenty of nervy play from the home team (Dra≈æen Petroviƒá getting a technical for accosting the referee and Franjo Arapoviƒá getting thrown out of the game for striking Darko Pahliƒá), Cibona had the early lead behind Cvjetiƒáanin's scoring (got 22 of Cibona's 42 first half points) while Dra≈æen Petroviƒá, who returned to the squad after controversially sitting out game two, also scored actively. Still, Zadar kept chasing with most of its first half points coming from their twenty-six-year-old captain Veljko Petranoviƒá and twenty-two-year-old center Stojko Vrankoviƒá. The team's leading scorer, shooting guard Petar Popoviƒá, on the other hand, was completely out of the shooting rhythm ‚Äî missing his first three shots, getting benched seven minutes into the game by head coach Vlade ƒêuroviƒá, and ending up scoreless at halftime. Cibona was up 42-37 at halftime. Popoviƒá finally managed to get on the scoresheet five minutes into the second half, which led to him starting to score in bunches. Still, Cibona led continuously and midway through the second half, with ten minutes to go, they were up by eleven points ‚Äî 71-60 ‚Äî its highest lead of the game. Zadar made one last push and managed to catch up with three-point shooting to tie up the score 85-85 at the end of regulation. The visiting team even had the last possession, but failed to score. Midway through the overtime, Cibona's leader Dra≈æen Petroviƒá fouled out with his fifth personal foul. At the end of overtime, the score was tied again, 96-96. In the second overtime, the game was decided by Popoviƒá's two three-pointers as Zadar pulled out a famous 110-111 victory on the road. It was Cibona's first home loss in a competitive game in over three years in all competitions ‚Äî with their previous home loss occurring on 16 March 1983 in the Yugoslav League versus Red Star Belgrade. And it was a costly loss for Cibona because it meant that despite winning the FIBA European Champions Cup that season, the club didn't get to compete in the next season's edition of the competition.

Frank Joyce, established a property of at Ulu, Kenya (near Machakos), where they initially farmed ostriches. On the outbreak of the First World War, he established a unit of volunteers, Wilson's Scouts, which was incorporated into the East African Mounted Rifles and saw service in the East African Campaign. Wilson was later attached to a South African division, where he oversaw military transport along the Rufiji River, in present-day Tanzania. He was awarded the DSO for his service during the war, with his partner, Joyce, receiving the MC. When the pair returned to their property, Kilima Kiu, many of their ostriches had been killed, and they turned to dairy farming. Kilima Kiu was at one stage the \\"largest dairy farm in all East Africa\\", but Wilson and Joyce divided it between themselves in 1934, after a quarrel.Collection Level Description: Papers of F. de V.

In later years, Wilson's farm held 2,500 cattle and employed over 400 staff, managed largely by his two sons. He also bred Arabian horses. Under a policy of self-containment, the property had its own factory, pasteurisation facilities, cannery, school, and airstrip. Wilson was also involved in public life in Kenya, briefly representing Ukamba in the Legislative Council of Kenya,Kenya Gazette: no. 1131. p. 281. 9 March 1927. and later chairing the Board of Agriculture, for which he was made a CMG in 1935 and knighted in 1949.

This species along with Centaurea diffusa are the stereotypical \\"tumbleweed\\" of the West- breaking off at the top of the roots which facilitates its seeds spreading far and wide, but are not actually native to the North American continent, but to a similar dry climate in the Mediterranean. Description and habitat This biennial or short-lived perennial plant usually has a stout taproot and/or pubescent stems when young. It has deeply lobed leaves and vibrant pink flowers. The sepals have black tips that look like spots, which is the origin of its common name. The fruit is an achene with a short, stubby pappus. The plant grows on stream banks, pond shorelines, sand prairies, old fields and pastures, roadsides, and along railroads, and many open, disturbed areas. Apparently, it should be treated as having two varieties.Yatskievych, G. (2006) Steyermark's Flora of Missouri. The Missouri Botanical Garden Press, St. Louis, MO, USA Invasive plant It has been introduced to North America,Mauer, T., Russo, M.J., and Evans, M. (2001). Element stewardship abstract for Centaurea maculosa, spotted knapweed . The Nature Conservancy. Retrieved online: 14 July 2007. where it is considered an invasive plant species in much of the western United States and Canada. In 2000, C. maculosa occupied more than in the US. Knapweed is a pioneer species found in recently disturbed sites or openings. Once it has been established at a disturbed site, it continues to spread into the surrounding habitat. This species outcompetes natives through at least three methods: # A tap root that sucks up water faster than the root systems of its neighbors, # Quick spread through high seed production, and # Low palatability, meaning it is less likely to be chosen as food by herbivores. It is also suspected to be allelopathic, releasing a toxin from its roots that stunts the growth of nearby plants of other species. Its seed is an achene about a quarter of an inch long, with a small bristly pappus at the tip which makes the wind its primary means of dispersal. The leaves are a pale grayish- green. They are covered in fine short hairs. First year plants produce a basal rosette, alternate, up to long, deeply divided into lobes. It produces a stem in its second year of growth. Stem leaves are progressively less lobed, getting smaller toward the top. The stem is erect or ascending, slender, hairy and branching, and can grow up to three feet tall. Because cattle prefer the native bunchgrass over knapweed, overgrazing occurs, increasing the density and range of knapweed infestations. Human disturbance is also a major cause of infestations. Knapweed readily establishes itself and quickly expands in all growth forms in places of human disturbance such as industrial sites, along roadsides, and along sandy riverbanks, and also has the potential to spread into undisturbed natural areas. Control =Biocontrol= Centaurea maculosa Thirteen biological pest control agents have been used against this plant and its cogener, diffuse knapweed, including the moths Agapeta zoegana and Metzneria paucipunctella, the weevils Bangasternus fausti, Larinus obtusus, and Larinus minutus and Cyphocleonus achates, and the fruit flies Chaetorellia acrolophi, Urophora affinis and Urophora quadrifasciata. But in general, biocontrol has not been shown to be effective against C. maculosa. In some instances, root-herbivory on C. maculosa stimulates additional release of catechin, the main allelopathic chemical which the species emits. In addition, moderate levels of herbivory by biocontrol agents can cause compensatory growth. =Prescribed grazing= Prescribed grazing may be an effective means of controlling infestations. All growth forms are nutritious to sheep. High- density infestations can be controlled by fencing in the control area with sheep until the desired level of removal is achieved. Allelopathy via catechin The roots of C. maculosa exude (-)-catechin. This acts as an herbicide to inhibit competition by a wide range of other plant species. This phytotoxic compound inhibits seed germination and growth in making phosphorus more available in certain soils. It leads to cell death of competing plants by acidification of the cytoplasm. Some natives, such as Gaillardia grandiflora and Lupinus sericeus, are resistant to catechin-induced toxicity. This resistance is conferred by these plants' ability to produce oxalate. Furthermore, native grasses grown in conjunction with oxalate-producing plants benefited from presence of oxalate. Impact in North America Centaurea stoebe ssp. micranthos in East Wenatchee, Douglas County, Washington Spotted knapweed likely spread to North America in an alfalfa shipment. It was first recorded in Bingen, Klickitat County, Washington in the late 1800s; by 1980, it had spread to 26 counties in the Pacific Northwest. In the year 2000 it was reported in 45 of the 50 states in the US. Spotted knapweed primarily affects rangelands of the northwest United States and Canada. A 1996 study estimated the direct plus secondary economic impact of spotted knapweed in Montana to be approximately $42 million annually. When spotted knapweed replaces native grasses, soil erosion and surface runoff are increased, depleting precious soil resources. In 2015, a Missoula, Montana beekeeper whose bees rely on local knapweed stated that \\"knapweed produces great honey ... people should consider planting native wildflowers instead of just taking out weeds.\\" Nomenclature The common name spotted knapweed most often refers to Centaurea maculosa; however, inconsistencies exist in the scientific community. Two cytotypes of the plant exist which have been named as either different species or subspecies. Centaurea maculosa has been used to describe the diploid and tetraploid form, however the diploid form has been called Centaurea stoebe which, having been published before C. maculosa, is the correct name for the species and the tetraploid form Centaurea biebersteinii.

It is named after Adrien-Marie Legendre. It is also sometimes known as de Polignac's formula, after Alphonse de Polignac.  Statement  For any prime number p and any positive integer n, let u_p(n) be the exponent of the largest power of p that divides n (that is, the p-adic valuation of n). Then : u_p(n!) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{p^i} \\\\right\\\\rfloor, where \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor is the floor function. While the formula on the right side is an infinite sum, for any particular values of n and p it has only finitely many nonzero terms: for every i large enough that p^i > n, one has \\\\textstyle \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{p^i} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 0. = Example = For n = 6, one has 6! = 720 = 2^4 \\\\cdot 3^2 \\\\cdot 5^1. The exponents u_2(6!) = 4, u_3(6!) = 2 and u_5(6!) = 1 can be computed by Legendre's formula as follows: : \\\\begin{align} u_2(6!) & = \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac 6 {2^i} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac 6 2 \\\\right\\\\rfloor + \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac 6 4 \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 3 + 1, \\\\[3pt] u_3(6!) & = \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac 6 {3^i} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac 6 3 \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 2, \\\\[3pt] u_5(6!) & = \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac 6 {5^i} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac 6 5 \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 1. \\\\end{align} = Proof = Since n! is the product of the integers 1 through n, we obtain at least one factor of p in n! for each multiple of p in \\\\\\\\{1, 2, \\\\dots, n\\\\\\\\}, of which there are \\\\textstyle \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{p} \\\\right\\\\rfloor. Each multiple of p^2 contributes an additional factor of p, each multiple of p^3 contributes yet another factor of p, etc. Adding up the number of these factors gives the infinite sum for u_p(n!).  Alternate form  One may also reformulate Legendre's formula in terms of the base-p expansion of n. Let s_p(n) denote the sum of the digits in the base-p expansion of n; then : u_p(n!) = \\\\frac{n - s_p(n)}{p - 1}. For example, writing n = 6 in binary as 610 = 1102, we have that s_2(6) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 and so : u_2(6!) = \\\\frac{6 - 2}{2 - 1} = 4. Similarly, writing 6 in ternary as 610 = 203, we have that s_3(6) = 2 + 0 = 2 and so : u_3(6!) = \\\\frac{6 - 2}{3 - 1} = 2. = Proof = Write n = n_\\\\ell p^\\\\ell + \\\\cdots + n_1 p + n_0 in base p. Then \\\\textstyle \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{p^i} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = n_\\\\ell p^{\\\\ell-i} + \\\\cdots + n_{i+1} p + n_i, and therefore : \\\\begin{align} u_p(n!) &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\ell} \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{p^i} \\\\right\\\\rfloor  &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\ell} \\\\left(n_\\\\ell p^{\\\\ell-i} + \\\\cdots + n_{i+1} p + n_i\\\\right)  &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\ell} \\\\sum_{j=i}^{\\\\ell} n_j p^{j-i}  &= \\\\sum_{j=1}^{\\\\ell} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{j} n_j p^{j-i}  &= \\\\sum_{j=1}^{\\\\ell} n_j \\\\cdot \\\\frac{p^j - 1}{p - 1}  &= \\\\sum_{j=0}^{\\\\ell} n_j \\\\cdot \\\\frac{p^j - 1}{p - 1}  &= \\\\frac{1}{p - 1} \\\\sum_{j=0}^{\\\\ell} \\\\left(n_j p^j - n_j\\\\right)  &= \\\\frac{1}{p - 1} \\\\left(n - s_p(n)\\\\right). \\\\end{align}  Applications  Legendre's formula can be used to prove Kummer's theorem. As one special case, it can be used to prove that if n is a positive integer then 4 divides \\\\binom{2n}{n} if and only if n is not a power of 2. It follows from Legendre's formula that the p-adic exponential function has radius of convergence p^{-1/(p-1)}.

Overview The rationale for P2P asset management is financial disintermediation. When multiple intermediaries participate in an investment management transaction, there is the potential for a conflict of interest between providers and buyers of the service, in a well documented sequence described in economic theory as the principal‚Äìagent problem. Intermediaries seek profit maximization. In the context of investment management, they offer the most attractive risk/return propositions to larger, more sophisticated customers. This maximizes their commission revenue for a given distribution effort. Further, given the option between two comparable investment opportunities, an intermediary enticed by investment management kickbacks will recommend the option most lucrative to him, perhaps at the expense of the best interests of non-sophisticated investors. This regime is under regulatory and competitive pressure because it privileges large, sophisticated investors at the cost of the choice available to the relatively worse-off, and because incentives are against the most vulnerable element of the chain. The FCA (UK), have implemented the \\"treating customers fairly\\" policy, with wide-ranging reforms such as the Retail Distribution Review, gradually banning \\"kickbacks\\" whereby providers of investment management services reward \\"independent\\" advisers who place their products. Rather than the symptom ‚Äì kickbacks and inadequate advice ‚Äì new competitors tackle the issue ‚Äì multiple intermediaries ‚Äì by disrupting the intermediation chain. Propositions leverage the reach of the Internet to pair a central provider of investment management services with end-customers online. P2P asset management takes dis-intermediation full circle. Rather than a central provider directing investors choices, an information exchange takes place between all investors, whereby the best performing strategies by all are made available to all. The first completely P2P provider is Darwinex (UK). Darwinex describe themselves as an exchange pairing providers with buyers of investment strategies, without intermediaries. Buyers pay providers with a share in their investment profits, with Darwinex acting as a central counter-party that independently lists the strategies for a public quoted price based on the underlying assets, rates strategy quality and manages investor risk. P2P asset management offers the potential benefit vs. centralized providers that all participants crowdsource strategies that are independently rated in a competitive set-up. Characteristics While peer-to-peer asset management shares some of the characteristics of traditional investment management services, owing to its innovative nature it is sometimes referred to as an alternative financial service. The key characteristics of peer-to-peer asset management are: * it is conducted for profit; * it is open to all, without minimum investment volumes * no necessary common bond or prior relationship between strategy providers and investors; * intermediation by a peer-to-peer asset manager or strategy exchange; * transactions take place on-line; * Investors pick their chosen strategies without 3rd party advice; Early peer-to-peer asset management was also characterized by disintermediation and reliance on social networks but features like \\"Social Trading\\" have started to fade. Since \\"Social Trading\\" disclosed live trades, investors learnt to replicate the strategies without compensation to the best providers, who then refused to publish them. Popular providers of P2P asset management services such as Darwinex provide the following services: * Brokerage and execution services for strategy providers to route their strategies to the market * Rating services benchmarking strategies for desirable attributes like experience, risk management, discipline, timing, performance and scalability * Risk management services shielding investors from unexpected deviations from target risk by the strategy providers * Custody services ‚Äì in segregated accounts with low risk counterparties * Verifying investor identity, employment and income under customer protection legislation such as MiFID in Europe * Processing payments from investors and carrying out the delivery versus payment payment to the providers agreeing to their strategy being replicated * Regulatory cover (asset management is a regulated activity that only authorized persons may legally carry out) and legal compliance and reporting * Attracting new providers and investors (marketing) Legal regulation P2P asset managers broadly require two sets of regulatory permission. The first is to carry out brokerage services on behalf of traders and investors. The second is to manage investment strategies on behalf of retail or professional investors. In the UK, these two permissions are the local implementation of MiFID regulation, referred to as \\"Dealing in investments as agent\\" for brokerage services, and \\"Dealing in investments as principal\\" and \\"Managing Investments\\" for the asset management side of the proposition. Further, permission is required for \\"Arranging safeguarding and administration of assets\\", which grants investors protection under the FCA Client Money Rules. An important nuance is that P2P asset managers could suffer a conflict of interest, if in addition to acting in an agent capacity, providing investment management and brokerage services, they entered deals for their own account, acting as principals. This would stack their principal interests against the customers it served as agent. Traditional providers of financial services potentially suffering this conflict claim to overcome it by enforcing a Chinese wall. P2P managers tackle the issue at source by acting exclusively in an agent capacity. Customers may verify this restriction by ensuring that P2P managers hold the \\"matched principal restriction\\", whereby the regulator bans their engaging in any activity as a principal. A further test to identify conflicts of interest is to verify that execution services are provided at arms' length through 3rd parties (ideally recognized exchanges), at public prices. Advantages and criticism The main advantage of P2P asset management is the lack of intermediaries, which results in two structural advantages. The first is that all incentives are aligned. The strategy provider can be certain that the strategy is not disclosed by the exchange because this would drop its prize to zero and hurt the exchange. The investor can be certain that the exchange will do its best to rate the strategies accurately, since it is the only way to ensure long term volumes. The second advantage is that any profits achieved by the strategies are only shared between the strategy provider, the buyer, and the exchange. There is a single intermediary, without which the profit exchange is not possible, but no more. Some have criticised P2P asset managers for the lack of \\"professional\\" asset management expertise by the strategy providers.

Background Basement formed in Ipswich in 2010, signing to independent label Run for Cover in August of that year. The band released their debut album, I Wish I Could Stay Here, in July 2011. The group then toured across the UK several times, as well as tour the US and Australia. Composition and production Compared to their past releases, guitarist Alex Henery called the process for Colourmeinkindness \\"the most chaotic process we have ever gone about writing a record.\\" The band members would write parts and sent them over email to each other, and exchanges ideas on the parts. With Henery residing in the US, the group were unable to get together and write in a practice space. With Colourmeinkindness, the group \\"wanted to explore new sounds and techniques ... We all wanted to push the sound of the band into new places,\\" according to Henery. The album's sound has been described as alternative rock, emo, grunge, punk rock and rock. Recording for Colourmeinkindness took place at The Panda Studios in Fremont, California with producer Sam Pura in July. According to Henery, the group were \\"forced to work as hard\\" as they could given a limited time period in the studio. During the first day in the studio, the band were awake until 4am \\"putting the parts together for songs and pretty much writing songs from scratch.\\" Henery saw this as providing \\"a fresh approach to writing the album.\\" Pura understood the band's sonic vision and provided a lot of ideas as well as \\"explore new techniques in layering and texturizing the sound of the album.\\" Pura engineered and mixed the recordings, while T W Walsh mastered them. Release and commercial performance On 16 July 2012, Colourmeinkindness was announced for release in the fall. Three days later, the band announced they were going on hiatus. In said announcement, the group revealed that the hiatus was \\"[d]ue to a number of personal commitments\\". In July and August, the band toured across the US alongside Dead End Path, Soul Search and Daylight. On 6 September, \\"Spoiled\\" was made available for streaming. Five days later, \\"Covet\\" was made available for streaming. Colourmeinkindness was made available for streaming on 15 October, before being released on 23 October through Run for Cover. In mid- November, the band played their final shows in the UK, prior to reforming in 2014. Colourmeinkindness peaked at number 188 on the Billboard 200, as well as reaching number 1 on Vinyl Albums, number 8 on Heatseekers Albums and number 48 on Independent Albums. Despite the lack of press coverage or live dates to support it, the album has since sold over 25,000 copies worldwide.Ayres 2016, p. 45 Critical reception Colourmeinkindness received positive reviews upon release. AbsolutePunk reviewer Adam Pfleider wrote that the album featured \\"just as many references to indie, grunge and alternative shoegaze as there are allusions of radio's top 40 at its height in 1996.\\" Pfleider also wrote that the band managed to craft \\"a near perfect combination of grunge cult and top singles of the '90s.\\" In a short review for AllMusic, Matt Collar wrote that the album \\"showcases Basement's passionate, sprawling, emo-influenced rock.\\" James Tremain of Alter the Press! wrote that the album owed \\"as much to mid-90s emo and grunge acts such as Nirvana\\" as it did to \\"modern day punk.\\" He went on further to say that the band constructed an album that \\"knows both when to swing its punches and when to offer a shoulder to cry on,\\" being \\"equal parts brute force and beauty.\\" Kill Your Stereo reviewer Maddo wrote that the one of the group's most appealing traits was the \\"honesty and sincerity in Fisher's lyrics.\\" Maddo favourably compared Fisher's voice to that of Sunny Day Real Estate frontman Jeremy Enigk. Punknews.org reviewer RENALDO69 called the album \\"incredible ... a near-flawless record\\". He praised Fisher's vocals, referring to them as \\"top-notch\\" and \\"remarkable\\".

After serving as Imperial German military attach√© in Paris, Schwartzkoppen was later given the rank of General of the Infantry, and held various senior commands in World War I. He is known for his role in the Dreyfus Affair. Early life and career He was born in Potsdam, Brandenburg, the son of Prussian general Emil von Schwartzkoppen (1810‚Äì1878) and his wife, Anna Marie Luise, n√©e von Ditfurth (1816‚Äì1865). The Schwartzkoppen family, ennobled in 1688, descended from Brunswick. Schwartzkoppen joined the Prussian Army in the late 1860s and took part in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. He served as a member of the general staff with the rank of captain (Hauptmann) from 1885 to 1888 and thereupon became adjutant to Prince Ernest Louis of Hesse. Dreyfus Affair On 10 December 1891, Schwartzkoppen was appointed as military attach√© at the Embassy of the German Empire in Paris, maintaining relations with the French Republic. It was his second diplomatic posting to Paris. In addition to performing formal representational and liaison duties, his subsidiary task was to obtain secret information on the French Army without the knowledge of the German ambassador resident in Paris. Instead, Schwartzkoppen reported directly and in confidence to the Director of Military Intelligence in Berlin. As a result of his spying, he became involved in the Dreyfus Affair. In 1894, he received an anonymous offer for the purchase of rather insignificant military intelligence, outlined in an unsigned bordereau.The French word bordereau means simply a note or slip of paper and can be applied to any note. In French, many documents in the Dreyfus case were called bordereaux (plural), but this is the one that is generally referred to in connection with the case. The torn paper, supposedly in the handwriting of Alfred Dreyfus, was recovered from Schwartzkoppen's wastebasket by a French cleaning woman on September 25 and became the key evidence of Dreyfus's conviction for treason. Serious doubts regarding the guilt of Dreyfus were raised during his trial. Later investigations showed that Schwartzkoppen was receiving intelligence not from Dreyfus but another French officer, Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. Schwartzkoppen himself confirmed Dreyfus's innocence in his memoirs, which were published posthumously in 1930. In the 1890s, Schwartzkoppen had an affair with Hermance de Weede, the wife of the Counsellor at the Dutch Embassy in Paris, and a large number of their letters were intercepted by the authorities. Also intercepted was the correspondence between Schwartzkoppen and a popular figure in Parisian diplomatic circles - Maguire, Robert J. Ceremonies of Bravery: Oscar Wilde, Carlos Blacker, and the Dreyfus Affair, Oxford University Press, 2013, p48 the Italian military attach√©, Lieutenant Colonel Count Alessandro Panizzardi. Italy and Imperial Germany were then formally linked under the Triple Alliance of 1882 and letters between the two attach√©s record that they freely exchanged intelligence and cooperated on espionage matters.Maguire, Robert J. Ceremonies of Bravery: Oscar Wilde, Carlos Blacker, and the Dreyfus Affair, Oxford University Press, 2013, p48 The letters also contain passionate and erotic endearmentsCorrespondance de Panizzardi √† Schwartzkoppen, Dossier Secret, 2F, Service Historique de la D√©fense, 2016 which indicate that they too were having an affair. The Schwartzkoppen and Panizzardi material was withheld from the Dreyfus defence team in 1894 but was later discussed in a closed session during the 1899 retrial.Forth, Christopher \\"The Dreyfus Affair and the Crisis of French Manhood, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006, p46 While neither officer had anything to do with Dreyfus, the correspondence lent an air of truth to other documents that were forged by prosecutors to lend retroactive credibility to Dreyfus's conviction as a spy. Some of the forgeries even referenced the apparent affair between the two officers. In one, Alessandro supposedly informs Panizzardi that if \\"Dreyfus is brought in for questioning\\", they must both claim that they \\"never had any dealings with that Jew.... Clearly, no one can ever know what happened with him\\". The letters, real and fake, provided a convenient excuse for placing the entire Dreyfus dossier under seal because the exposure of the liaison would have \\"dishonoured\\" the German and Italian militaries and compromised diplomatic relations. Later life and death In 1897, while the Dreyfus Affair was still at its height, Schwartzkoppen was recalled from his diplomatic posting in Paris to take up command of the 2nd Kaiser Franz Ferdinand Regiment of Grenadiers. In 1902, he married Luise Grafin von Wedel with whom he subsequently had two daughters. Promoted to the rank of general in 1907, Schwartzkoppen retired from the army the following year, moving to his country estate in the Altmark. With the outbreak of war in August 1914, General Schwartzkoppen returned to active service. He commanded the 233rd Infantry Brigade in France, before being appointed in 1916 to lead the 202nd Infantry Division on the Russian Front. Suffering from pneumonia, he was hospitalized in Berlin. While delirious, he reportedly blurted out, \\"Listen to me. Dreyfus is innocent. There is no evidence whatsoever against him\\". His wife, seated at his side, made a written record of this statement. Schwartzkoppen did not recover and died on 8 January 1917. Personality Schwartzkoppen was described as being a cultivated officer with considerable social charm; characteristics which suited him for the diplomatic and Imperial Court functions that made up much of his military career. Decorations and distinctions Schwartzkoppen was an officer of the Kaiser's Military Suite and Colonel of the Emperor Franz Grenadier Guards Regiment. He received the decorations of Holder of the Red Eagle, First Class with oak leaves; Order of the Crown, First Class; and Member of the Knights of St John.

He served as the Unionist MP for Richmond (Yorkshire) from 1918 to 1929.

Sir Murrough Wilson.\\" The Times (London, England), Thursday, 2 May 1946; pg. 7; Issue 50441. Retrieved 28 November 2014. His father, Colonel John Gerald Wilson CB, was an officer in the York and Lancaster Regiment, and died of wounds during the Boer War, at Tweebosch. Murrough Wilson was one of seven children, and the second-oldest of four brothers. The oldest brother, Lt. Richard Bassett Wilson, was also killed in the Boer War, at Rustenburg. The third brother, Lt.-Col. Denis Daly Wilson MC, was killed in action in France during the First World War, while the fourth brother, Capt. Sir Frank O'Brien Wilson, was a Royal Navy officer and later a member of the Legislative Council of Kenya. The brothers' nephew through their youngest sister was James Ramsden, a Cabinet member as the final Secretary of State for War.RAMSDEN, James (b.1923). ‚Äì The History of Parliament. Retrieved 28 November 2014. Educated at Marlborough College, Wilson joined the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1893, and by 1912 was a director at the company. An officer with the 2nd/5th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment during the First World War, he was elected to parliament at the 1918 general election, which, as the first after the conclusion of the war, was considered a \\"khaki\\" election. Wilson, who stood as a Unionist for the Yorkshire constituency of Richmond, was one of the flood of Coalition MPs elected, although he was replacing a fellow Conservative, William Orde-Powlett (later Lord Bolton). He was elected unopposed at the following three general elections, in 1922, 1923, and 1924, but left parliament prior to the 1929 election. His successor, Thomas Dugdale (later Lord Crathorne), held the seat for the next 30 years. Maintaining his directorship of the NER throughout the war, Wilson continued as a director after the formation of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. From 1924, he was chairman of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes, for which he was knighted in 1927. A Deputy Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire in later life, he was also a director of the Yorkshire Insurance Company (now part of Aviva), and later sat on the board of the London Electricity Board. Wilson had married Sybil May Milbank, a daughter of Sir Powlett Milbank, 2nd Bt., in 1904, with whom he had four children. She died in 1930, and he remarried in 1934, to Gladys Rhoda Henderson (n√©e MacLean), a widow. Wilson had succeeded his father as lord of Cliffe Hall, and died there in 1946, aged 70. He was described in his obituary in The Times as a \\"great Yorkshireman, very well known throughout the whole county\\", and had earlier succeeded the 3rd Baron Grimthorpe as president of the Society of Yorkshiremen in London.

They are small fish, averaging at , orange-brown with white undersides in life, with characteristic iridescent blue or lavender stripes on the sides and on top of the body. They are usually found in large schools in the sloping or vertical drop-offs at coral reef edges. They are sometimes caught for the aquarium trade, and are also known by hobbyists under the name blue line flagtail goby. The species is named in honor of the schooner Te Vega. Taxonomy T. tevegae belongs to the Trimma tevegae species group of the dwarfgoby genus Trimma. It was included in the true goby subfamily Gobiinae in the goby family Gobiidae. However, the 5th Edition of Fishes of the World does not give any subfamilies in the Gobiidae. It was first described by the ichthyologists Daniel M. Cohen and William P. Davis in 1969 from specimens collected in Rabaul, New Britain. The generic name Trimma is derived from Greek œÑœÅŒØŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ (trimmatos, \\"something crushed\\"). The specific name is in honor of the schooner Te Vega, which was used as the research vessel (then under the Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station) by the authors during the collection trip. In 2005, the ichthyologist Richard Winterbottom examined specimens of Trimma caudomaculatum, described in 1975 by the Japanese ichthyologists Tetsuo Yoshino and Ch≈´ichi Araga, and compared them with specimens of T. tevegae. Based on morphology, he concluded that they belonged to the same species, and thus synonymized T. caudomaculatum with T. tevegae. However, he reversed this opinion after a 2011 phylogenetic study on the genus Trimma. T. caudomaculatum is now again considered to be a separate valid species, though still closely related to T. tevegae. The study also revealed that T. tevegae may be a cryptic species complex. T. tevegae is known under a number of common names in English, mostly based on the characteristic blue stripe running through the body. These include various permutations of the names \\"bluestripe pygmgygoby\\", \\"blue-striped cave goby\\", or \\"blue-striped dwarfgoby\\". It is also known under various non-specific common names in other languages, like mano'o-moi in Samoan and kultit or paku in Calamian Tagbanwa in the Philippines. Description Male with elongated second dorsal spine preserved, from Koror, Palau, Bluestripe pygmygobies are tiny fish, usually averaging at . The maximum recorded length is . The dorsal fin has seven spines and eight to nine soft rays. The second dorsal spine in males is elongated and filamentous. The anal fin has one spine, and eight to nine soft rays. They are predominantly orange-brown in color with a white underside. The source of their common name is a lavender to blueish stripe running through the middle of the upper body; from the upper lip, across the upper part of the eye, and towards the tail. A narrower stripe of the same color also runs along the base of the dorsal fin. On the base of the tail is a large dark reddish- brown blotch. They seem drab in preserved specimens, but in living specimens they display brilliant blue, green, and vivid pink iridescence when light shines upon their bodies. Distribution T. tevegae can be found in the Western Pacific coral reefs usually at depths of , with a maximum recorded depth being . They have been recorded in the Ryukyu and Izu Islands of Japan to New Britain, Papua New Guinea; and from the Rowley Shoals of Australia to Tonga. Ecology Bluestripe pygmygobies generally congregate in large, loose schools near coral reef drop-offs pockmarked by caves or recesses. They may school together with related species like the nasal dwarfgobies (Trimma nasa) or wasp pygmygobies (Trimma flavatrum). They usually orient themselves vertically with their heads facing upwards along the coral reef wall and feed on zooplankton traveling down the water column. When threatened they will quickly retreat inside hiding places. T. tevegae has one of the longest lifespans among the characteristically very short-lived dwarfgobies. The longest on record was an individual in captivity in the Waikiki Aquarium in Hawaii which lived for 20 months. Importance Bluestripe pygmygobies are not fished for food by humans, but they are sometimes caught for the aquarium trade. Though rarely available, they are comparatively the most common dwarfgoby species kept in reef aquaria, particularly in the smaller nano reef tank setups. This is due their hardiness, the ease of their care, their size, and their shoaling behavior. In addition to usual common names, they are sometimes referred to as the \\"blue line flagtail goby\\" by hobbyists.

The school is situated in Le Domaine de Freins surrounded by a park of 9 hectares in the Uccle commune in Brussels, Belgium. The school offers day school and full boarding facilities. History Stemming from Bogaerts Education, founded in 1970 by Rodolphe Bogaerts, Bogaerts International School was founded in 2012, by his son David Bogaerts with an aim to offer international education. In the early days the school was situated in Argenteuil area of Waterloo, Belgium. It initially offered both English and French courses throughout the primary and secondary years and followed both the International Baccalaureate Organization and Cambridge International Examinations. As the number of students enrolling in the IB programme grew rapidly over the years, a need for a larger space to accommodate more students lead the school to its current location at Le Domaine de Freins in Uccle in the year 2017. BIS got its first authorization by the IB in 2015 to offer the IB Middle Years Program for Grades 6 to 10. The following year, BIS was authorized by the IB to offer the IB Diploma Program for grades 11 and 12. In the year 2019, BIS was authorized by the IB to offer the IB Primary Years Program for Grades Pre-primary up till year 5, thus becoming the only fully accredited IB school in Brussels. Premise The school is situated on the Domaine Latour de Freins in Brussels. The building was erected by the architect Henri Maquet in 1890. The U shaped building takes full advantage of the available sunlight and the Flemish neo-renaissance shape, typical for the period, allies brick masonry with white and blue stone bonds, and a natural slated roofing. The property comprises a wooded park with a surface area of 62,800m2. The school consists of a large parking area, an outdoor tennis court, a backyard play area, an indoor gymnasium and a large indoor cafeteria. Currently, the school also hosts students in its boarding facility located within the campus. Academics Currently, B.I.S. is the only fully accredited IB world school in Brussels, offering a continuum of three programmes of education: IB Primary Years Programme (PYP), IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) and the IB Diploma Programme (DP). B.I.S. also offers an early years programme which is a part of the PYP for the tiny tots aged between 3 and 6 years. Early Years During the early years, the four-unit curriculum is based upon transdisciplinary and inquiry methods, but is primarily based upon play-learning, life-skills learning, and social-skills learning. This is a programme inspired by the Montessori method of education, and that influences the day-to-day and big-picture activities within the learning environment. Literacy skills that include basic reading and handwriting skills are also developed by the end of Early Years 3 class aged 5 years. Primary Years Programme Transdisciplinary approach: A unified learning goal which includes language, mathematics, social studies, art, and/or science principles, is set out for the students in way where they can approach one topic through various subjects at once thus, helping them build a strong foundation. Inquiry based approach: In all parts of the curriculum, B.I.S. focuses on the asking and answering of questions. These questions, the natural curiosity of our students, are thus used to drive the direction of education. Conceptual approach: Approaching learning as a conceptual process, rather than an information recitation process. B.I.S. develops a student's ability to think critically and creatively using challenging and relative ideas, and these ideas are used to help students understand their own decision-making power in the world. Knowledge based approach: On the more practical side of the curriculum, and in order to encourage a rigorous and competitive academic standard within the school, B.I.S. also utilizes content maps to ensure the students succeed to their fullest potential. Middle Years Programme Contextual approach: Learning approach based on connections between [students‚Äô] studies and the real world, as well as striving towards the development of skills for communication, intercultural understanding, and global engagement is what the MYP focuses on. Thus, curriculum in the MYP is developed with the learner and his or her needs and goals. Service based approach: Students, as part of the curriculum and their extra-curricular time, will be responsible for not just learning more about what it means to be a member of a community, but to act on that understanding for the betterment of others. Conceptual approach: The MYP approaches learning from a conceptual perspective ‚Äì ‚Äúbig ideas that have relevance within specific disciplines and across subject areas\\". Learning without the restrictions of strict subject study is encouraged and learning through reinforcement and revision is supported. Knowledge based approach: Specific subject study is equally encouraged at the secondary level, and students will find themselves focusing on languages, mathematics, sciences, humanities, current affairs, digital design, art, and performing arts within the structure of the programme. Diploma Programme Contextual approach: Students are required to study one subject from each of the five subject groups (Language & Literature, Language Acquisition, Individuals and Societies, Experimental Sciences and Mathematics), along with an arts subject from group 6, or a second subjects from groups 1 to 5. All DP students must choose three courses at Higher Level (HL) and three courses at Standard Level (SL). Knowledge based approach: In addition to disciplinary and interdisciplinary study, the Diploma Programme features three core elements that broaden students‚Äô educational experience and challenge them to apply their knowledge and skills: the Extended Essay, Theory of Knowledge and Creativity, Action, Service (CAS). Besides the IB programme the school also offers language courses from beginner to advanced levels for students in languages like French, Spanish and Italian. Sports & Extra-curricular Activities B.I.S. offers a multitude of sports and extra-curricular activities like music, hip-hop dance, zumba classes, tennis, classes to enhance logical and critical thinking through robotics, boxing classes, coding classes etc. to name a few.

It was discovered on 24 December 1981, by American astronomer Laurence Taff at Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico, United States. The asteroid was named after amateur astronomer Wolf Bickel.  Orbit and classification  Bickel orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì3.1 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,483 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 8¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Heidelberg Observatory in 1924, extending the body's observation arc by 57 years prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.  Physical characteristics  Bickel has been characterized as a common S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In September 2001, the first ever conducted photometric observation of Bickel at the Rozhen Observatory, Bulgaria, rendered a rotational lightcurve with a longer-than-average period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.63 magnitude (). A more refined lightcurve was obtained in October 2005, by astronomers Raymond Poncy, Laurent Bernasconi and Rui Goncalves, which gave a well-defined period of hours with an amplitude of 0.72 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to observations by NASA's space-based Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Bickel measures 11.7 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.248, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a slightly larger diameter of 12.4 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.9.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of German amateur astronomer Wolf Bickel (born 1942) who began observing minor planets at his private Bergisch Gladbach Observatory in 1995. At the time this minor planet was named, he had discovered more than 540 numbered minor planets. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 22 July 2013 (). Bickel has become Germany's most prolific discoverer of asteroids, ahead of (professional) astronomer Freimut B√∂rngen, the first time in 150 years, that an amateur astronomer is ranking first among the German top discoverers. His total number of discoveries has since increased to more than 600.

The manufactory was founded in 1897 by an outstanding merchant Ivan Korsakov. The merchant took into consideration the fact that the native citizens of ancient Novgorod were reputed for great skills in producing excellent vodka, which amused overseas connoisseurs of alcoholic beverages since 13th-15th centuries.

At first the merchant Ivan Korsakov had his own distillery in his house, and in the year of 1897 he opened \\"The first Novogorodian state wine storehouse\\" within the program of governmental wine monopoly. In 1899 8 workers were employed at the distillery. Korsakov expanded the production and opened one more manufactory in Borovichy (Novgorod region). Afterwards these distilleries belonged to the merchant's heritors. \\"The storehouse\\" had been successfully producing Russian vodka by the times of the World War I. After that production and selling of vodka to the public was forbidden. Since 1914 to the October Revolution state hospital was placed in the storehouse's building. In December 1916 the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna with her daughters visited it with meritorious purposes. After the revolution the manufactory's spaces were occupied with governorate spirit storehouses. Spirit was produced for medical and army needs till 1924. On 1 October 1924 the manufactory was renamed into Novgorod Distillery No.1 and began to produce vodka with the purpose of struggling with home brewing. The first vodka the distillery produced was 20% ABV Russkaya Gorkaya. The first party was produced on 9 October and sold in the manufactory's store on the following day. In the year of 1925 the manufactory was again renamed, this time into Novgorod Distillery No.5, and joint with Staraya Russa and Borovichy Distilleries. In this year Distillery No.5 began to produce 40% ABV Russkaya Gorkaya, and in 1932 ‚Äì 40% ABV vodka Pshenichnaya, classical Russian vodka made from wheat. Especially extensive development of distillery's work belongs to pre-war period. In 1936 a new department of liquor beverages was created. In 1937 the number of employees was about 200, and the distillery produced 335 thousands liters in the last quarter. At that period the manufactory produced about 60 beverages and sold them in 70 manufactory's stores in Novgorod, Pskov and Leningrad provinces. In 1938 Novgorod Distillery made the top three at the All-Russia Tasting among 500 alcohol producers for the high quality of beverages. The main building of the distillery destroyed during WWII. During the World War II distillery workers produced bottles with flame liquid for the front line, which Germans named as \\"Molotov cocktail\\". Till the beginning of fascist occupation of Novgorod on 19 August 1941, in short period, 70 thousand of bottles have been produced at the distillery which worked 24-hour on three- shift basis. By the moment of liberation of the city from the fascists the manufactory was seriously destroyed with hostile bombardments. Novgorod was included in the list of cities subjected to foremost reconstruction. The distillery began to reborn together with the city. The reconstruction of the destroyed manufactory began in July, 1944; few months later production of 40% ABV vodka in casks began. Famous \\"front 100 grams\\" were sent to military units. After WWII 40% ABV vodka was casked. For many years the distillery was working according to the national USSR standards. During perestroika period and for the several next years the manufactory has made a significant leap: modern technological equipment produced by the leading foreign companies has been installed, the recipes of unique original beverages have been formulated, store chain has been opened and distribution trade has been developed. The wine storage and wine department with a capacity of 600 thousands of decaliters were opened in 1960. The range of beverages was more than 60 products (red wines, brandy, liquors) prepared from natural raw material purchased in France and Spain.

A film showing conflict between superstitions and beliefs of people highlights the bhootharadhane (spirit worship) of the region. Plot Manu, a doctor who lives in the U.S., visits his mother along with his wife and daughter, in the ancestral house after several years. Ajjamma (Manu's mother) tells Manu that she had promised to perform the Kanchil ceremony if a girl was born to her son, but Manu dismisses it as a \\"blind belief\\". She made the promise as her son and daughter-in-law did not have a child even after more than four years of marriage. Manu said that he would not allow his daughter to participate in the ceremony as he and his wife had deferred having a baby because she was still pursuing her studies for some years after they got married. In many ways, the film is about negotiating between tradition and modernity, and faith and superstition, as well as the omnipresent caste. Manu's wife suggests that there is no harm in letting the ceremony as it would please the old woman. Manu remained adamant arguing that his daughter was not born because god willed it to happen.

The film is shot in two parts, with the first (Trial by Fire) examining the link between the violence of the Hindu nationalist movement, such as the demolition of the Babri Masjid, and sexual violence against women. The second part (Hero Pharmacy) looks at the nature of masculinity in contemporary urban India, and its role in encouraging sexual violence. As with other films of his, Patwardhan had to fight multiple court battles in order to force the national carrier Doordarshan to screen the film, a screening which eventually occurred on the orders of the Supreme court. The film received numerous national and international awards, and was also seen positively by critics.  Synopsis  = Part 1: Trial by Fire = The title of the first section is a reference to the ordeal that the Hindu god-king Rama used to test the fidelity of his wife after rescuing her from the demon king Ravana. The segment describes the various interconnected instances of communal violence in India in the years prior to the film. The film opens with the aftermath of the anti-Muslim riots in Bombay that followed the demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992. Several Hindu youth are heard speaking to the cameraman, saying that they had enjoyed the killing and looting, and that a list of Muslim individuals had been prepared beforehand, and that some authority figures knew of the plans to target Muslims. The film then describes a connection between the Indian nationalist movement and violent masculinity. In a voice-over, Patwardhan states that as a result of the British Raj stereotypes of \\"effeminate\\" Hindus and \\"martial\\" non-Hindu communities, the nationalist movement turned to militant symbols like Shivaji and Rama. This led to an identification of Hinduism with the traditions of communities with more militant traditions, such as the Rajputs and the Marathas, which included practices like sati. This leads to a description of the murder of Roop Kanwar in Deorala, Rajasthan, in 1987. Kanwar was forced to immolate herself on the funeral pyre of her husband, supposedly in keeping with the tradition of sati, a practice that had been illegal since 1830. The documentary then goes on to describe how the identification of Hinduism with militant traditions also resulted in all opponents of Hindutva, including secular leaders and Muslims, as weak and effeminate. The film depicts several public rallies and speeches in which Hindu leaders use misogynistic language while criticizing Muslims. Instances of misogyny and intolerance in other religious groups is also depicted, with footage of Sikhs demonstrating in favor of Khalistan, and the Fatwa issues against Salman Rushdie. = Part 2: Hero Pharmacy = The second segment of the documentary depicts common icons of masculinity, and explores their connection to misogyny and sexuality. Specifically, the film focuses on symbols of masculinity that are phallic in nature. Many political leaders are heard linking non-violence and secularism to weakness and impotency. A religious leader campaigning for the Shiv Sena in Gujarat is seen asking Hindu women to have eight children apiece, as a means of combating the perceived menace of Muslims. The film shows the visits of several western cultural icons to Mumbai, and the hero-worshiping reactions they generated among male youth from different backgrounds. The film then looks at aggressive and violent depictions of masculinity on television, both in Bollywood movies and in WWE wrestling, and at reasons for their popularity. Examples of young children from different class backgrounds are shown exhibiting behavior that idolizes violence. Upper class children are shown mobbing professional wrestler Randy Savage, more commonly known by his stage name of \\"Macho Man\\", while young male members of the Shiv Sena, from less wealthy backgrounds, are shown engaged in street-fighting. Several young men are heard off-screen describing how watching rape in movies was \\"fun\\", and discussing the possibility of gang-raping a woman that they are not acquainted with.  Reception  The film was completed in 1994, and released the next year. It won two national awards and multiple international awards in the years that followed. In 2004, the European DOX magazine listed it as one of the 50 most memorable documentaries of all time. As with previous films produced by Patwardhan, the national television channel Doordarshan initially refused to screen the film. Patwardhan challenged this decision in the Bombay High Court, which ruled in his favor in 2001, ordering Doordarshan to telecast the film. The carrier challenged this decision in the Indian Supreme Court, which ruled in Patwardhan's favor in 2006, ordering that the film be screened without any cuts within eight weeks. The judges observed that \\"This documentary film [...] showcases a real picture of crime and violence against women and members of various religious groups perpetrated by politically motivated leaders for political, social and personal gains.\\" The film was eventually screened following the ruling. The film has a rating of 8.7 on the Internet Movie Database. History professor Vinay Lal, writing in the European art journal Third Text, stated that Father, Son, and Holy War was a nuanced and daring film, that examined the \\"nexus between communalism, the changing culture of the contemporary Hindi film, violence towards women in many domains of Indian society, vernacular forms of masculinity, and other aspects of Indian society and culture.\\" However, he said that film made a crude distinction between patriarchy and matriarchy, and had a simplistic view of historical matriarchal societies. At the same time, Lal referred to Patwardhan as the most astute and sensitive documentary makers in his portrayals of Hindu communalism and the sexual aspects of its ideology. Gail Minault, reviewing the film for the Journal of South Asian Studies, wrote that the film was \\"powerful\\" and \\"harrowing.\\"  Awards  * National Film Award, Best Investigative Documentary, India, 1995 * National Film Award, Best Film on Social Issues, India, 1995 * Special Jury Prize, Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival, Japan, 1995 * In The Spirit of Freedom Award, Jerusalem International Film Festival, Israel, 1995 * Special Jury Prize, Vancouver International Film Festival, 1995 * International Jury Prize, Bombay International Film Festival, 1996 * Audience award, Sheffield International Documentary Festival, 2012  References   External links  * Category:Indian documentary films Category:Indian films Category:1995 films Category:Anand Patwardhan Category:Documentary films about violence against women ","title":"Father, Son, and Holy War"},{"id":"44534463","text":"The Guanshan Riverside Park () is a park along the Keelung River in Songshan District of Taipei, Taiwan.
