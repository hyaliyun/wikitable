Construction The drug rehabilitation facility's construction commenced in July 2016 but construction only went full swing after Health Secretary Paulyn Jean Ubial signed a deed of donation with Chinese billionaire and philanthropist Huang Rulun in a meeting in Beijing, China. Huang previously met with President Rodrigo Duterte and talked about how could help deal with the illegal drugs problem in the Philippines. Huang met with Duterte thrice with two of the meetings conducted during his presidential campaign. The facility was constructed in a land at Fort Magsaysay. The land where the facility is to be located was identified by the Department of National Defense (DND). 75 shipping containers of China-imported material will be used in the construction of the facility. The materials to be used are the same to those used in facilities erected as part of the rehabilitation of areas affected by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). The materials are also stated to be fire-resistant and the construction project of the facility also include water and electricity works. By October 12, 2016, the facility was stated to be 50 percent complete with the right wing of the building which can accommodate about 1,000 patients already ready to be furnished. The left wing and the female dormitory is being constructed by this time. The facility had its soft opening in October 17, 2016 with the newly-hired staff of the facility set to have a \\"dry-run' on patient management before the facility was scheduled to begin accommodating drug dependents within the month of November 2016. President Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to lead the inauguration or full opening rites of the facility at 2:00 p.m. (UTC+8) on November 29, 2016. The inauguration marks the completion of the Phase I of the project. Facilities Health Secretary Francisco Duque led the inspection of the drug rehabilitation facility in February 2020. The facility was among those being considered as possible quarantine site for repatriated Filipinos from Wuhan, China due to the 2019-20 novel coronavirus outbreak. The drug rehabilitation facility will host around 10,000 bed facilities. Upon its inauguration in November 2016, the facility will host an initial 2,500 bed facilities. Management The drug rehabilitation facility is to be put under the Department of Health. The DOH will turn over the facility to the military once the number of admitted drug dependents is significantly reduced. The operating expenses for the facility for 2017 is estimated to be around . Reception Dangerous Drugs Board chairman Dionisio Santiago described the facility as a \\"mistake\\" and \\"impractical\\" saying it would be better if the funds used to build the facility was used on smaller community-based rehabilitation programs that would accommodate 150 to 200 drug dependents instead which he believes would be effective. He also says it is difficult to admit patients from far- flung areas such as Batangas and Batanes. In June 2017, the facility had 311 residents.

It is located at the intersection of Avenida M√°rtires da Machava and Avenida Ahmed Sekou Tour√©.  History  The building was erected in 1934 as a residence by Portuguese. Remarkable are the Azulejos, as a rare example of naturalistic decorated tiles from the time of the beginning of the twentieth century - alongside the Historicism architecture. With the start of the colonial war in the then Portuguese colonies of Guinea, Angola and Mozambique, the Portuguese secret police PIDE extended their activities to the territories of the colonies. The PIDE confiscated the building and established its seat there. During the colonial war many resistance fighters were tortured in this building. The Mozambican poet Jos√© Craveirinha tells of his experiences in the house in three of his works.N√£o sei se √© uma medalha (1967), Vila Algarve (1¬™ vers√£o) (1988) and Vila Algarve (2¬™ vers√£o) (1998) Other known inmates were, among others, Rui Knopfli and Malangatana Ngwenya. After the independence of Mozambique, the building remained empty due to its past; including the homeless. In 1999 the Mozambican Lawyers Association acquired the building and planned to set up its headquarters there. The cost was estimated to be 400,000 euros. Later, the association withdrew from its plans and handed over the building to the Ministry of Culture. On behalf of the Ministry of Resistance, a \\"Museum of the Liberation of Mozambique\\" is to be set up there. Since 2011 the building is in the pre-selection for a memorial list for Maputo.

It was first published in 1971 by Macmillan. The story is derived from a press report.Martin Stannard, Muriel Spark: The Biography, Hachette UK, 2009, accessed 18 October 2016 Plot summary 'A storm rages round the towers of the big house near Geneva. Behind the locked doors of the library, the Baron, the Baroness and their handsome young secretary are not to be disturbed. In the attic, the Baron's lunatic brother howls and hurls plates at his keeper. But in the staff quarters, all is under control. Under the personal supervision of Lister, the Baron's incomparable butler, the servants make their own, highly lucrative, preparations for the tragedy. The night is long, but morning will bring a *crime passionnel* of outstanding attraction and endless possibilities.'  Reception  '[Muriel Spark's] new novel is an agile send-up of different kinds of popular fiction: detective stories, the Jeeves novels, and realistic tales about the servant problem. Read with these parallels in mind, Not to Disturb offers fresh laughter and acerbic insight into conventional ways of writing about the hypocrisies of master-servant relationships. Occasionally, the parody extends to other Gothic novels. ... Not to Disturb has the cleverness to entertain and the intelligence to provoke thought; but, finally, its philosophical mysteries look suspiciously like pretenses, and the book leaves the annoying as well as the stimulating after- effects of legerdemain.'

It has a brand portfolio of over 600 brands and its products are sold throughout Central America and the Caribbean. Dos Pinos is structured as cooperative where partners who invested in the organization share in the profits according to their shares. It is regulated by Costa Rican law under the \\"Ley general de cooperativas\\".  History  = Origins = Cooperativa de Productores de Leche R.L. (popularly known as ‚ÄúDos Pinos‚Äù) was founded in 1947 by a group of 25 dairy farmers from Costa Rica seeking to unite in order to have a stable plant through which they could sell their milk due to the issues with the fluctuation of demand on a product that is perishable. This initial phase of the business of Dos Pinos was successful but it was not until 1952 that it enters the business of processing and pasteurization of milk. In these initial years the cooperative was forced to diversify its business because milk prices were regulated in Costa Rica which limited the profitability of the business. The cooperative decided to focus then on the ‚Äúnoble products‚Äù (dairy derivatives) which helped its bottom line and helped it expand its number of processing plants. In 1978 Dos Pinos opened a large powdered milk plant in Ciudad Quesada allowing it to better process milk from the northern part of the country. In 1982 it was reported that the company had 10 operating plants in Costa Rica. In 1985 Dos Pinos opened its dairy aseptic filling plant using Tetra Brik packaging which allowed it to introduce longer lasting milk into the market. In 1988 the firm completed its first formal export order abroad opening itself to selling to nearby countries. = Expansion = In 2007 it opened its operations in Guatemala by building a large distribution center and setting aside space for a future processing plant. In 2008 through an alliance with Cooleche Dos Pinos branded milk started being sold in Panama; also in 2013 the cooperative purchased Planta Nevada from \\"Cervecer√≠a Nacional de Panam√°\\" which produces milk and juice beverages. In August 2015 Dos Pinos acquired the industrial products company ‚ÄúLa Completa‚Äù in Chontales, Nicaragua in order to boost its presence in that country. In September 2016 Dos Pinos diversified its operations with the acquisition of the ‚ÄúGallito‚Äù candy confectionary subsidiary from Mondelez International for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition cost for Gallito was $6.7 million dollars.

Biography Luz Elisa Borja Mart√≠nez was born in Riobamba in 1903, the daughter of Ricardo Borja Le√≥n and Victoria Mart√≠nez D√°valos. Through her father, she was a direct descendant of Juan de Borja y Enr√≠quez de Luna, the third Duke of Gand√≠a, and Juana de Arag√≥n y Gurrea. The former was the grandson of Pope Alexander VI and the latter was granddaughter of King Ferdinand II, descended from the rulers of Navarre and Aragon. From a wealthy family, she was allowed the resources to develop her artistic talents. She was educated at the San Vicente de Pa√∫l college in Riobamba, run by the Sisters of Charity. As a multidisciplinary artist since childhood, Borja studied poetry, music, painting, and sculpture. Some of her original works are housed at the Casa de la Cultura in Chimborazo. In only 24 years of life she amassed an extensive body of written work that, after her death, her brother Luis Alberto published in two books named Cofre Rom√°ntico and La Bella Durmiente. The second includes the poem \\"Quiero Llorar\\" (I Mourn), which she wrote in 1918 at age 15, saddened by the death of the mother superior of the Sisters of Charity of Riobamba. It consists of seven stanzas, two of which went on to become the lyrics of the Ecuadorian pasillo known as \\"Lamparilla\\". Miguel √Ångel Casares Viteri composed the music, inspired by the poem and dismayed by the damage caused by a flood of the Chanch√°n River. Her poetry is considered by connoisseurs to be tinged with a nostalgic, anguished romanticism ‚Äì a search for happiness not found, which leads her to wait for it in the great beyond. She achieved success and awards in several Ecuadorian cities, and was cited by the foreign press at the time as one of that country's most illustrious poets. Ever since, she has been known as \\"La Alondra del Chimborazo\\" (The Lark of Chimborazo). Her contemporaries were the poets Miguel √Ångel Le√≥n, Miguel √Ångel Zambrano, Luis Alberto Falcon√≠, Miguel A. Costales, Gustavo Vallejo Larrea, and Hugo Rom√°n. Within Ecuador, she was influenced by the modernist literary movement known as the generaci√≥n decapitada (decapitated generation), composed of Medardo √Ångel Silva, Arturo Borja (her second cousin), Ernesto Noboa y Caama√±o, and Humberto Fierro. Internationally, she was influenced by the French authors Charles Baudelaire and St√©phane Mallarm√©. In the field of music she appreciated and exquisitely interpreted the works of Liszt, Schubert, and Beethoven. She died in Riobamba on 10 July 1927, and was buried in the cemetery of that city. Tributes The Casa de la Cultura in Chimborazo created a library named for the poet, in a building ceded by the City Council of Riobamba on 21 April 1954. It had been willed by Borja's mother, with the provision that it be used as a library and cultural center. In Borja's native Riobamba, there is a street bearing her name. Considered a classic of its kind, the pasillo \\"Lamparilla\\" has been traditionally played by the most important singers and musical groups in Ecuador, as well as by prominent vocalists from other countries.

Life Luise Karoline Ries was born in the Altenkessel quarter of Saarbr√ºcken. Her father, Wilhelm Jakob Ries, worked as a machine maintenance engineer. Her mother, born Margaretha Luise Forst, died during her birth, and her father died shortly afterwards. She was accordingly bought up by her maternal uncle, Friedrich Forst, in Wiebelkirchen, a small town in the hilly countryside between Saarbr√ºcken and Mainz. After leaving middle school Luise Ries undertook domestic service and office work in a wholesale business. She married , a labour activist and, after 1930, a Communist Party member, in 1923. (some sources give the marriage year as 1932, but they appear to be in the minority.) This brought her into contact with the Communist Party which she herself joined in 1931. By that time she had already been politically active in other areas, notably, since 1929, through her membership of the \\"League of Working Women\\" (\\"Bund werkt√§tiger Frauen\\"). She became a member of the Young Friends of Nature (\\"Naturfreundejugend Deutschlands\\") in 1927. In 1932 Lilli Herrmann-Ries was elected to the Saarland parliament (\\"Landesrat\\"), becoming (after Elisabeth Hallauer) only the second - and as matters turned out the last - woman elected to the legislature. During the buildup to the 1935 referendum on the political status of the Saarland she campaigned against reunification of the Saarland with the rest of Germany, which had been transformed into a post-democratic single-party dictatorship since the Nazi takeover two years earlier. The referendum result nevertheless overwhelmingly favoured a return, for the region, to its pre-war incorporation into the rest of Germany: the Communist Party was illegal in Hitler's Germany, and later in January 1935 she fled to Paris. A few months later she had made her way to Moscow where she was able to be reunited with her husband who had also managed to escape from Germany. Between August 1935 and July 1937 she attended the Comintern's International Lenin School in Moscow, where she was identified by the cover name \\"Hilde Engelmann\\". The two of them then made their way back to France. For many people it took some months for the declaration of war by France and England to have much obvious impact, but thousands of German refugees from Nazi Germany, including Lilli Herrmann-Ries, were identified as enemy aliens and arrested. She was held at the concentration camp in Gurs (with a short interval when she was held at Rivesalt) for sixteenth months. In June 1941 she was returned to Germany with her daughter and set to work at the steel works in Neunkirchen. However, on 21 September 1941 she was arrested by the Gestapo. At a trial on 28 May 1942 she was sentenced to spend four and a half years in prison. She was held in prison at Aichach in Upper Bavaria between 1942 and 1945. At the end of the war, in May 1945, she was released by US troops. Her husband, by this time, had died under circumstances that were never clear, in February 1944, at Butzbach. Luise Herrmann-Ries died at Neunkirchen in the Saarland on 17 January 1971. There had been no return to politics or activism for her after 1945.

He soon began to receive commissions from Ernst Bojesen at Gyldendalske Boghandel (Nordisk Forlag), culminating with the illustration of Carit Etlar's works (1905‚Äì06) and Feltl√¶gens Historier by Zacharias Topelius (1906‚Äì08). He also worked for magazines such as Klods-Hans, Bl√¶ksprutten, Politikens Magasin and Berlingske Tidende Sunday. He illustrated numerous books in the 1920s and also created book covers. He also created posters, post cards and stamps. He designed the annual Danish Christmas seal in 1914. Paintings Andersen had his debut as a painter at Charlottenborg's spring exhibition in 1906 with a portrait of Johannes V. Jensen. He was also represented at Charlottenborg's Spring Exhibition in 1908 and 1914 and at its Autumn Exhibition in 1914. His works as a painter include portraits of Henrik Cavling, Ludvig Kraft, Peter Nansen and Henri Nathansen. Decorative works As a decorative artist, Andersen collaborated with Anton Rosen, working on projects such as the Metropol Building in Copenhagen (1906‚Äì07), the Danish National Exhibition of 1909 in Aarhus and Palace Hotel (vestibule, 1910).

ICES scientists have secure access to Ontario's health administrative data. ICES research teams produce peer-reviewed scientific journal articles, as well as reports and atlases to assist health care providers, government planners and policy makers in improving population health through the advancement of evidence-based practice and health policy. ICES was established in 1992 and is governed by a Board of Directors. ICES receives core funding from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC). In addition, ICES faculty and staff receive peer-reviewed grants from federal funding agencies such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and project-specific funds from provincial and national organizations. Most of the more than 250 scientists affiliated with ICES have clinical and/or teaching appointments at hospitals and universities across Ontario.  Research programs  ICES research is distributed across eight health areas: # Cancer # Cardiovascular # Chronic Disease and Pharmacotherapy # Kidney, Dialysis and Transplantation # Life Stage # Mental Health and Addictions # Populations and Public Health # Primary Care and Health Systems  Locations  ICES' Central location is on the campus of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, with satellite locations at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, the University of Ottawa, The University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, the University of Toronto, McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario and Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario.  History  In the early 1990s, the Government of Ontario identified a growing need for evidence on health system performance in Ontario, in order to ensure the quality and efficiency of health services being provided. Dr. David Naylor and Dr. Jack Williams proposed to provincial health officials the creation of a new research institute that would securely analyse the administrative data routinely collected by the government through the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP), in order to produce population-based evidence with the goal of improving health care delivery and patient outcomes. ICES was launched in April 1992, with Dr. Naylor as the founding Chief Executive Officer.  Privacy and security  ICES is designated as a \\"prescribed entity\\" in Ontario under the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA). Under Section 45 of PHIPA, this designation allows ICES to collect and use administrative data for the purposes of monitoring and evaluating the provincial health system. To be eligible to collect and use information under this authority, an organization must receive the approval of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (the IPC), which must find that the organization is equipped to protect it. All ICES policies, practices and procedures for using data are reviewed and approved by the IPC every three years.  Methodology and data holdings  The ICES data repository consists of patient-level, coded and linkable health records. It includes publicly funded administrative health services records for the Ontario population eligible for universal health coverage since 1986, within Ontario's population of 14.7 million (as of 2019). Through partnerships, the data repository also securely links data from a variety of health surveys and registries. By linking the different data sets together using anonymous numeric unique identifiers, ICES scientists track different aspects of health service use and patient outcomes over time and across the province.  Examples of research impact  # A 1997 ICES study led by Dr. Donald Redelmeier and published in the New England Journal of Medicine on the links between mobile phone use and motor vehicle collisions helped lay the groundwork for legislation banning driver cell phone use in Ontario and many other jurisdictions. # A 2004 ICES study led by Dr. Muhammad Mamdani published in The Lancet found that of 45,000 Ontario seniors prescribed rofecoxib, 80% had an increase in hospital admissions for heart failure, while patients using other NSAIDs had a 40% increase. Although the absolute risk for heart failure was less than 1%, this finding was significant, given that more than 1 in 5 Ontario seniors were taking these medications. Vioxx was withdrawn from the market later that year. # A 2006 ICES study led by Dr. Laura Park- Wyllie showed that gatifloxacin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic marketed as Tequin, could cause potentially life-threatening blood sugar abnormalities. The investigation showed that patients treated for low blood sugar levels were more than four times as likely to have received gatifloxacin as other common antibiotics, while those hospitalized with high blood sugar levels were nearly 17 times as likely to have been treated with the medication. Health Canada issued a warning shortly after the study appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, and soon after, the drug's manufacturer announced it was halting production. # ICES research into the impact of mandatory reporting on reducing hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile infections led by Dr. Nick Daneman has influenced Ontario's MOHLTC policies on mandatory hospital reporting of quality improvement targets. # A 2013 ICES study led by Th√©r√®se Stukel identified nearly 80 informal multispecialty physician networks that formed the theoretical basis for the Ontario Community Health Links initiative currently underway for managing care for patients with complex conditions. The concept was cited as a model for using big data in the public interest in the 2015 Government of Canada \\"Report of the Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation\\" led by Dr. David Naylor. # Work led by ICES chief science officer Astrid Guttmann in 2015 showed that the number of children and youth being treated for concussion in Ontario had risen sharply during 2003‚Äì2011. Concern with these findings helped pave the way for the implementation of \\"Rowan's Law,\\" requiring measures be taken to prevent and mitigate head injuries due to participation in youth sports. # The 2015 ICES research report \\"Brain Disorders in Ontario: Prevalence, Incidence and Costs from Health Administrative Data\\" produced in collaboration with the Ontario Brain Institute is being used in 2016 to plan Ontario's Dementia Strategy. # A 2015 ICES Western study led by Dr. Amit Garg and published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed the feasibility of a new technique to assess risk in living kidney donor candidates, which showed that some donors are unnecessarily excluded as donors for kidney transplantation due to older age or comorbidities. The findings form a framework for the new international clinical practice guidelines in living kidney donation and a risk assessment tool that is being used with donor candidates in Ontario as part of the informed consent process. # Due to a rapid rise in the number of research studies conducted using routinely collected health data, ICES researchers were part of an international committee of researchers who published reporting guidelines called \\"RECORD\\" for all observational studies conducted using health data, which are applicable to research using health administrative data, electronic health records, registries, and other data sources. RECORD has been endorsed and implemented by over 15 journals since its publication in October 2015, including the PLoS group of journals, JAMA, The BMJ, and CMAJ.

He helped Dravya Shah to become King of Gorkha and was later appointed Minister (Bhardar) of Gorkha Rajya. He is the founder of the aristocratic Pande family. His descendants were Kalu Pandey, Kaji of Gorkha and his sons Dewan Kaji Bamsa Raj Pandey and Mulkaji Damodar Pande and also Kaji Tularam Pande. Coronation of Dravya Khan Shah Dravya Shah was the youngest son of Yasho Brahma Shah, Raja (King) of Lamjung and grandson of Kulamandan Shah Khad, Raja (King) of Kaski. He became the king of Gorkha with the help of accomplices namely Kaji Ganesh Pandey. He ascended the throne of Gorkha on 1559 A.D. 19th century writer Daniel Wright describes the coronation of Dravya Shah as: Previously, the local Ghale people had chosen their king from the winners of an annual running race. Dravya Shah was not a physically robust man but he was cheater his way to the win. He was backed by the Bhattarai, Aryal, Adhikari, Pant and Acharya clans who were Jaisi Brahmin. By 1570, when Dravya Shah died, the running race was but a memory among the people. Dravya Shah used the army of the Magar (an ancient tribe of Nepal) to invade neighboring states and his successors continued this aggression to increase the territory belonging to Gorkha. Kaji Ganesh Pande was his first minister of Gorkha. Descendants Ganesh Pande was the first Kaji (Prime Minister) of King Dravya Shah of Gorkha Kingdom established in 1559 A.D. The Pandes were considered as Thar Ghar aristrocratic group who assisted the administration of Gorkha Kingdom. Kaji Kalu Pande (1714-1757) belonged to this family became a war hero after he died at Battle of Kirtipur. Page 227 These Pandes were categorized with fellow Chhetri Bharadars such as Thapas, Basnyats and Kunwars.http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/contributions/pdf/CNAS_02_01_09.pdf The inscription installed by son of Tularam Pande, Kapardar Bhotu Pande, on the Bishnumati bridge explains their patrilineal relationship to Ganesh Pande, Minister of Drabya Shah, the first King of Gorkha Kingdom. The lineage mentions Ganesh Pande's son as Vishwadatta and Vishwadatta's son as Birudatta. Birudatta had two sons Baliram and Jagatloka. Tularam and Bhimraj were sons of Baliram and Jagatloka respectively. Kaji Kalu Pande was the son of Bhimraj. Bhotu Pande mentions Tularam, Baliram, and Birudatta respectively as his ancestors of three generations. However, Historian Baburam Acharya contends a major flaw in the inscription. Ranajit Pande, the second son of Tularam was born in 1809 Vikram Samvat. Baburam Acharya assumed 25 years for each generation where he found Vishwadatta to have been born in 1707 Vikram Samvat. Thus, on this basis, he concluded that Vishwadatta could not have been the son of Ganesh Pande, who was living in 1616 Vikram Samvat, when Drabya Shah was crowned King of Gorkha. He points that the names of two more generations seem to be missing.

It is thought that even subtle cooling effects resulting from a regional nuclear exchange could have a substantial impact on agriculture production, triggering a food crisis amongst the world's survivors. While belief in the \\"nuclear winter\\" hypothesis is both popular and heavily debated, the issue of potential food supply disruption from blast and fallout effects following a nuclear war is less controversial. Several books have been written on the food supply issue, including Fallout Protection, Nuclear War Survival Skills, Would the Insects Inherit the Earth and Other Subjects of Concern to Those Who Worry About Nuclear War, and most recently the extreme nuclear winter and comet impact countermeasuring Feeding Everyone No Matter What. Together with these largely introductory texts, more official tomes with a focus on organization, agriculture, and radioecology include Nutrition in the Postattack Environment by the RAND Corporation, the continuity of government plans for preventing a famine in On Reorganizing After Nuclear Attack, and Survival of the Relocated Population of the U.S. After a Nuclear Attack by Nobel Prize winner Eugene Wigner, while those focused solely on radioecology and agriculture include Effects of Fallout Radiation on Crop Production, Behavior of Radioactive Fallout in Soils and Plants, Behavior of Radioactive Fallout in Soils and Plants (1963) and practical countermeasures that were intended to be taken on the individual level in Defense Against Radioactive Fallout on the Farm. Early work One of the first works to discuss the problem of fallout, farming, food and supply was Herman Kahn's 1960 publication On Thermonuclear War. Kahn argued that while total war would indeed be an \\"unprecedented catastrophe\\", food which is slightly-to-moderately contaminated need not be wasted as the ingestion of such food by the elderly would not result in any observable increase in cancer in this cohort. This is due to the fact that, like other common carcinogens such as cigarette smoke, cancers do not immediately emerge after exposure to radiation or specifically from nuclear fallout; instead cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+ years, which is supported by the research of Project 4.1. It is for this reason that the elderly could eat slight-to-moderately contaminated food without much, if any, ill effect, allowing for the most uncontaminated food to be saved for younger generations. Overview From 1983-1985, in a time period during which the \\"nuclear winter\\" hypothesis was notably still in its early \\"apocalyptic\\" 1-D computer model phase, more than 300 physical, atmospheric, agricultural and ecological scientists from over 30 countries around the world came together to participate in the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment-Environmental Effects of Nuclear War (SCOPE-ENUWAR) project. This project assessed the global consequences of nuclear war, resulting in a two-volume publication titled Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War, detailing the physical, atmospheric, ecological and agricultural effects of a major nuclear war. In the publication, it is predicted that billions of survivors in the aftermath of nuclear war, even in non-combatant countries, may experience a dwindling food supply (if the continuity of government countermeasures were not fielded) which plunges survivors into \\"massive levels of malnutrition and starvation,\\" and in dire situations, \\"only a small fraction of the current world population could expect to survive a few years\\". Many processes can be involved leading up to a massive food shortage on a global scale. To begin, crops, stored food and agricultural supplies such as fertilizers and pesticides can be instantly destroyed in nuclear blasts; nuclear contamination of soil, air and water can render food unsafe to eat, and crops unable to grow properly; and uncontrollable fires can impede normal agricultural or food gathering activities. Experts predicted that in the first few years that follow a nuclear war, more complex processes, such as the crippling of the international economy and trade systems, collapse of global food transportation and distribution networks, loss of exportation incentives and importation, drastic climatic stress on the agroecosystems, and associated chaos and disruption in society can spawn to escalate the problem of food shortage.Harwell, M., and C. Harwell. (1986). \\"Nuclear Famine: The Indirect Effects of Nuclear War\\", pp. 117‚Äì135 in Solomon, F. and R. Marston (Eds.). The Medical Implications of Nuclear War. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. . Following the publication of Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War, more studies have emerged based on modeling and analysis of hypothetical nuclear exchanges between nuclear-armed nations. The conclusions of these studies illustrate that a nuclear war is a self-destructive road to mass starvation, and echoed the statement made in The Medical Implications of Nuclear War, a publication by the National Academy of Sciences, that \\"the primary mechanism for human fatalities would likely not be from blast effects, not from thermal radiation burns, and not from ionizing radiation, but, rather, from mass starvation\\". While the total number of global nuclear weapons had declined by two thirds following the U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) compared to the early 80s, some experts feel that the risk of nuclear conflict has not decreased, but has instead risen. This is due to nuclear proliferation as more countries such as India, Pakistan, and North Korea now have nuclear arsenals, increasing the risk of regional nuclear conflicts. Growing military tensions, accidents, sabotages and cyber-attacks are all potential trigger points of massive nuclear disruption and regional, if not global famine. Effects of nuclear winter on agroecosystems Based on the faulty studies, performed early in the 1980s, it was predicted that an American-Soviet nuclear war would project so much light-blocking smoke into the atmosphere, that months to years of \\"nuclear winter\\" could take place and bring any agricultural activity in the Northern Hemisphere to an acute halt. This was on top of exaggerated concerns, about the development of worldwide toxic photochemical ozone smog from high energy nuclear blasts, which was projected to bring about environmental conditions so disruptive for terrestrial plants and marine planktons to propagate, such that crop and marine harvests will be detrimentally affected. Biologists have long analyzed that a number of factors arising from \\"nuclear winter\\" will induce a significant impact on agriculture. For instance, nuclear war in growing seasons can bring about sudden episodes of low temperature (-10 degree Celsius or more) for days to weeks, and drawing reference from the \\"year without a summer\\" in 1816, episodes of freezing events are capable of destroying a large quantity of crops. In addition, growing season would potentially be shortened, as reported by Robock et al., who calculated that a regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan will substantially reduce freeze-free growing season in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for several years and devastate agricultural produce as crops do not have sufficient time to reach maturity. In contrast, the natural marine ecosystems, a major supplier of food to human societies, are less vulnerable to sudden temperature fall. However, they are highly sensitive to reduced incident sunlight and increased level of UV-B radiation. In the event of a large-scale nuclear war, a mere 25% reduction in ozone is predicted to cause an enhanced UV-B radiation that reduce net photosynthesis in the surface euphotic zone by 35%, and in the whole euphotic zone by 10% (euphotic zone refers to depths in the ocean with light levels sufficient for active photosynthesis). With a corresponding reduction in light available for photosynthesis, phytoplankton populations, in the 1985 book, were expected to plummet, and scientists had even speculated that most of the phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplanktons (that feed on phytoplanktons) in more than half of the Northern Hemisphere oceans would die. More modern appraisals of potential ozone layer issues arising from nuclear fireballs, have determined these earlier assumptions to have been completely unfounded. According to The World Bank, the ocean supplies the world's population with 16% of their animal protein intake; given that the marine food chains are built upon the photosynthesis of phytoplanktons, large-scale nuclear wars, in these 1980s models and books, was regarded as inadvertently devastating fisheries and to affect millions, if not billions of people who rely on the ocean for food. Effects of nuclear war on food distribution In addition to the adverse effects on the agroecosystems, socio-economical factors of war and nuclear destructions also possess far-reaching implications on food availability. It was observed in the aftermath of atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki that food was even more scarce as crops in nearby regions were destroyed and distribution of homegrown food from other parts of Japan was cut off as a result of railroad demolitions, when crop production was already affected drastically in previous years by war and poor weather. Not long after the war in 1946, the amount of food available in Japan could only provide individual Japanese with 1325 calories a day, a drop from 2000 calories consumed by an average citizen in 1941. Very soon, crippled distribution system, delayed relief and siphoning of resources from official channels to feed a thriving black market had gone so much out of hand that by the end of 1946, neglecting the input of the black market and looking solely at the official food rations, they could barely provide Japanese in affected cities with 800 calories a day. Although the total death toll due to starvation in Japan immediately after World War II could not be calculated, a distinguished Japanese historian, Daikichi Irokawa, noted that \\"immediately after the 1945 defeat, some estimated that 10 million people were likely to starve to death\\". Today, 85% of the nations in the world have low to marginal amount of homegrown food to sustain themselves and are increasingly reliant on well-connected food trade networks for imported food. A recent study (2014) examined the consequences of continental-scale disruptions on wheat and rice trade networks that can occur when global food supply is substantially reduced, such as following a large- scale nuclear war. Considering the tendency for exporting countries to withhold their crops in times of food shortage, the prediction model in this study determined that the amount of wheat and rice exports are reduced combined with losses in export networks. Critically, the authors found that the least developed countries will suffer greater import losses due to financial constraints, and the loss of trade networks will eventually lead to a larger population vulnerable to food shortages. Global famine due to regional nuclear conflict Much of the speculative research on nuclear war- induced climate change to date focuses on a hypothetical, large-scale nuclear exchange between modern day Russia and the United States. However, the post- Cold War world also includes a number of other nuclear-armed countries ‚Äî such as India, Pakistan, and North Korea ‚Äî that are currently engaged in de facto or frozen armed conflicts with their neighbors. In comparison to \\"global\\" nuclear war, a regional conflict between nations with relatively small nuclear arsenals would likely produce less dramatic climate effects. Nonetheless, it has been argued that global cooling resulting from such a conflict could have large-scale impacts on agriculture and food supply systems worldwide. Several studies led by Alan Robock of Rutgers University describe this possibility. A 2007 analysis using contemporary climate models found that a hypothetical nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan involving 100 Hiroshima-size bombs (less than 0.1% of the explosive yield of the current global nuclear arsenal) would be sufficient to cause drastic global cooling. The model not only predicted effects consistent with the traditional \\"nuclear winter\\" concept, but also suggested that climate effects would last longer than previously expected. These effects could include marked changes in normal seasonal patterns, a 10% average decline in rainfall around the world, and \\"a cooling of several degrees ... over large areas of North America and Eurasia, including most of the grain-growing regions\\". A related 2012 study assimilated a dynamic agrosystem model to predict the agricultural effects of an India- Pakistan war. The model in this case showed that a regional nuclear war on a separate continent could lead to a significant drop in yield for both corn and soybean production in the American Midwest, with the greatest crop losses occurring five years following the event. Over the ten years following the event, corn production was predicted to decline by an average of 10% and soybean by an average of 6‚Äì12%, depending on location. Year-to-year variability was expected to be high, and could be affected by anomalies in temperature, rainfall, and sunlight. Other studies based on a Robock et al. style India-Pakistan war utilize a different agricultural model to predict effects on rice production in China. After taking into consideration the weather conditions and farming practices specific to different provinces, rice production was predicted to decline by an average of 21% for the first four years and by approximately 10% the following six years. While potential adaptive measures (such as increasing rice plantations in less affected provinces or fertilizer adjustments) could be implemented, these strategies come with their own limitations and consequences‚Äîincluding further environmental pollution. Chinese production of maize and wheat could also be affected. In particular, wheat production in the wake of such an incident could drop by more than 50% in the first year and decline by an average of 39% in the first 5 years. =Vulnerable populations= The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) reported in 2013 that more than two billion people would be at risk of starvation in the event of a limited nuclear exchange, such as one that could occur between India and Pakistan, or by the use of even a small number of the nuclear weapons held by the US and Russia. This report argued that the world is in a state in which it is particularly vulnerable to even modest declines in food production. In turn, small changes in average global temperature can have disproportionately large effects on crops. Agricultural studies predicting substantial declines in U.S. and Chinese crop production may be conservative, as they do not take into account ozone depletion or daily temperature extremes. They cite the example of the Mount Tambora volcanic eruption in 1815, which produced an average annual temperature deviation of only ‚àí0.7 ¬∞C, but which brought mid- summer killing frosts to the mid-Atlantic states and caused up to 75% crop losses in northern Europe. In addition, the report authors argue that small perturbations in the food supply are highly amplified for malnourished populations. In particular, about 800 million people are chronically malnourished, and even a 10% decline in their food consumption would put them at risk. World reserves of grain stocks could serve as a buffer to this; however, rough estimates suggest that current reserves would only last approximately 68‚Äì77 days. Famines are also often associated with epidemics. Following the Mount Tambora eruption, an 1816 famine in Ireland triggered a typhus epidemic in Ireland that spread to much of Europe, and the Bengal famine of 1943 was associated with major localized epidemics of cholera, malaria, smallpox, and dysentery. Similarly, the vast and crowded megacities of the developing world could see major outbreaks of infectious disease as a secondary result of famine. However, as reported in a paper published in the journal Public Health Reports, it is one of a number of prevalent myths that infectious diseases always occur after a disaster in cities.

At first he was meant for the bar, then trained to farming as a country gentleman, and \\"given to cockfights.\\" In December 1645 he was admitted at Jesus College, Cambridge. Shortly after this he dates his \\"conversion.\\" In March 1648 he was ill of \\"a dangerous spotted feavour,\\" and after his recovery \\"set up a meeting of some schollars for religious purposes,\\" which he continued for some years after he left the university. Career He commenced B.A. in 1649, and in the same year received presbyterian ordination at Whitchurch, Shropshire. For about a year he preached in Staffordshire and Cheshire without fixed charge. In 1650 he settled as lecturer every other Sunday at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, preaching on the alternate Sunday in the country round. In the spring of 1652 he became lecturer at Atherstone Chapel in the parish of Mancetter, Warwickshire. He was the \\"one Macham, a priest in high account,\\" who prescribed physic and bloodletting for George Fox, the quaker founder. On 17 Nov. 1652 he was called to Astbury, Cheshire, as lecturer, and removed from Atherstone in the spring of 1653. At his own cost he set up a \\"double lecture\\" in twelve Staffordshire towns on the last Friday in each month. He devised the plan on 31 July 1652, and began its execution on 4 Aug. 1653. The last lecture was delivered on 2 Jan. 1660. John Walker says he was presented to the rectory of Astbury in 1654. This appears erroneous, for \\"by the coming of another incumbent\\" (George Moxon) his preaching at Astbury was limited to alternate Sundays, giving him opportunity to pursue his ministry at large. Machin and Moxon lived together at the rectory house. On 17 May 1661 he obtained the perpetual curacy of Whitley Chapel, in the parish of Great Budworth, Cheshire. The Uniformity Act of 1662 ejected him from this cure, but he appears to have remained at Whitley, preaching there and in the neighbourhood until the first Conventicle Act came into force (1 July 1664). He was then in bad health, and removed to Seabridge, where he died of malignant fever on Tuesday, 6 Sept. 1664. He published nothing, and is known only from A Faithful Narration of his life, published anonymously in 1671, 12mo, with a \\"prefatory epistle\\" by Sir Charles Wolseley. According to Philip Henry the author was Henry Newcome of Manchester, who had preceded Machin at Astbury. It is an excellent specimen of later puritan religious biography. It was reprinted in Samuel Clarke's Lives of Sundry Eminent Persons (1683), and republished in 1799, 12mo, with notes, by George Burder, who married a descendant of Machin. Family He was buried on 18 Sept. at Newcastle-under-Lyne. He married at Uttoxeter, on 29 Sept. 1653, Jane, daughter of John Butler, and had four or five children, including Samuel (b. 13 Nov. 1654, d. 29 July 1722), John (d. 5 Aug. 1741, aged 82 years and 10 months), and Sarah.

Given a drama expressed in some medium (text, video, audio, etc.), the process of metadata annotation identifies what are the elements that characterize the drama and annotates such elements in some metadata format. For example, in the sentence \\"Laertes and Polonius warn Ophelia to stay away from Hamlet.\\" from the text Hamlet, the word \\"Laertes\\", which refers to a drama element, namely a character, will be annotated as \\"Char\\", taken from some set of metadata. This article addresses the drama annotation projects, with the sets of metadata and annotations proposed in the scientific literature, based markup languages and ontologies.  Drama across media and genres  Drama encompasses different media and languages, ranging from Greek tragedy and musical drama to action movies and video games: despite their huge differences, these examples share traits of the cultural construct that we recognise as drama. drama can be considered as a form of intangible cultural heritage, since it is characterised by an evolving nature, with form and function that change in time: for example, consider the difference between the Greek Tragedy Oedipus and the modernist play Six Characters in Search of an Author. The exponential spread of drama in contemporary culture has led Martin Esslin to forge the definition of ‚Äúdramatic media\\", i.e. media that display characters performing live actions, such as theatre, cinema and videogames. The discrete manifestations of drama are documented in different media, including text, score, video, audio, etc. The dramatic content underlying these manifestation, however, does not depend on the specific medium: take, for example, the Arden edition of the written drama of Hamlet and Laurence Olivier's movie Hamlet, two examples of the drama heritage which share the same drama content despite the differences of the media support. The annotation of the content of media that convey dramatic content requires the use of an annotation schema expressed in a formal language, which makes the annotation comparable, and, possibly, machine readable. The first attempts at attaching content metadata to media concerned text documents and were carried out by using markup languages, such as XML, which allow to embed content tags into the document text. With the advent of the Semantic Web project, descriptive tools have evolved towards the use of ontologies, thanks to the languages and resources provided by the Semantic Web project. In particular, semantic annotation relies on the use of the Resource Description Framework language, specifically designed to described Web content of any type. The semantic annotation of drama consists of representing the knowledge about drama in a machine-readable format to serve the task of annotating the dramatic content coherently across different media and languages, abstracting at the same time from the technicalities of signals and text encoding. The annotation of dramatic content across media and genres is a way to preserve, compare and study the nature of drama and of its manifestations. Moreover, the availability of content metadata about drama is a precondition for a range of generative tasks that range from automatising the generation of drama to supporting human creativity in this task.  Story and Drama Annotation through markup languages and linguistic schemata  Story annotation consists of annotating the content of narratives. In most cases, this effort is undertaken with the goal of constructing corpora of annotated narratives, or story corpora, finalised at the study of the relationship between the linguistic expression of the story in the narrative and its content. In the last decade, to a number of research initiatives especially oriented to the description of story and characters. For example, consider the Narrative Knowledge Representation Language (NKRL) and the DramaBank project, specifically oriented to the representation of story content in natural language texts. The annotation of narrative texts has been prompted and influenced by two main lines of research. On the one side, the tradition of knowledge representation in AI has contributed the conceptual tools for describing the content of stories, with languages that span from scripts [Schank 1975] to frames. The linguistic counterpart of this line of research has resulted in resources situated at the lexical-semantic level (such as FrameNet and at the interface between syntax and semantics (such as PropBank, which offer tools for representing the connection between the expression of the narrative through the text and the narrative content itself). For example, the Story Workbench tool encompasses a layered annotation scheme, which uses these resources for the multi-layer annotation of narratives. On the other side, the annotation of narratives has benefited from the trend, established during the last three decades, of representing the content of documents in a machine-readable form. With the advent of markup languages such as Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) for encoding text in digital form and annotating their structure, the use of markup has soon become the standard in text annotation projects. In particular, projects such as Narrative Knowledge Representation Language (NKRL) leveraged the use of markup languages for the representation of the narrative content of text, revamping the use of frames into the emerging scenario of media indexing and retrieval. More recently, as part of the more general effort of constructing resources for the automation of language processing and generation, Elson has proposed a template based language for describing the narrative content of text documents, with the goal of creating a corpus of annotated narrative texts, called DramaBank project.http://lrec.elra.info/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/866_Paper.pdf In recent years, the annotation of narrative text has evolved towards minimal schemata targeted at grasping the regularities of written and oral narratives at the discourse level. These initiatives, however, rooted in narrative theories, tend to focus on the realization of narratives though a specific medium, i.e., text, leaving behind the universal elements of dramatic narration that go behind the expressive characteristics of each medium.  Story and drama annotation through computational ontologies  Mostly oriented to the indexing and retrieval of media, ontologies and vocabularies have appeared that support the representation of the content of media according to a shared semantics, available across the Web. In particular, semantic resources such as VERL (the Video Event Representation Language and LODE (Linked Open Description of Events) provide structured description of events that can be applied to the description of incidents in stories. In the paradigm of Linked Data, these resources become the infrastructure for content-based applications in the field of media: for example, consider the project EventMedia, where different vocabularies have been aligned with automatic methods to create an illustrated catalog of media representing events. A media-independent model of story is provided by the OntoMedia ontology, exploited across different projects (such as the Contextus Project to annotate the narrative content of different media objects, ranging from written literature to comics and TV fiction. This project encompasses some concepts, such the notion of character, that are relevant for the description of drama, but, being mainly focused on the representation of events and the order in which they are exposed in media for cross-media comparison, it lacks the capability of representing the core notions of drama. In the field of cultural heritage dissemination, the StorySpace ontology, an ontology of story, supports museum curators in linking the content of artworks through stories, with the ultimate goal of enabling the generation of user tailored content retrieval. A line of research has tackled the use of logical representations to describe stories, with the goal of creating generative systems that leverage the axiomatization of narrative structures. Finally, some scholars have created representational tools for specific narrative theories, ranging from literary structuralism to scriptwriting practices Drammarhttps://www.di.unito.it/wikidrammar wiki is an ontology of drama, specifically conceived to annotate dramatic media. Drammar aims at extending the use of ontologies to describe the content metadata of dramatic media in a theory-neutral, media-independent way. The use of the ontology format not only allows specifying the conceptual model of drama in a formal, unambiguous way but also makes the knowledge about drama available as a vocabulary for the interchange of annotations across different projects and readily usable for applications that encompass the manipulation of annotations by automatic reasoners and other software types  References   External links  * Story Workbench tool * Contextus Project * Drammar project wiki Category:Metadata ","title":"Drama annotation"},{"id":"51974251","text":"Grad Damen (born 14 August 1997) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays for TOP Oss, as a midfielder.

Thommessen, born in 1946, is known as an atonal modernist composer and a representative of the generation of composers who became active in the 1970s, whereas Paus, born in 1979 as the son of the prominent cultural figure Ole Paus and a relative of Henrik Ibsen, is a noted representative of a reorientation toward tradition, tonality and melody, who once described himself as a \\"cultural conservative non-modernist.\\" In the letter/libretto, Thommessen writes: The monologue is emblematic of the generation gap among older Norwegian atonal modernist composers and the younger generation of composers, who are more open to other musical styles and influences, including traditional ones. Thommessen had previously been Paus' teacher at the Norwegian Academy of Music. In his letter Thommessen chastised Paus for his tonal music. A long monologue on why Paus has misunderstood everything about music ends with the words \\"I do not want any more verbal contact with you.\\" At the time the opera monologue premiered, the \\"Teacher\\" in the monologue remained anonymous. The monologue played an important role in an extensive debate on musical aesthetics in the music journal Ballade in 2015, during which the formerly anonymous \\"Teacher\\" was revealed by Paus to be Olav Anton Thommessen; the debate was described as \\"the biggest public debate about art music\\" in Norway since the 1970s.

Trinity College had finally admitted women to the University just the year before, in 1904. Despite coming from a family of academics Lucy Gwynn had been unable to get a University education herself. She was 39 years old when appointed to her position in the university. Students described Lucy Gwynn as a pioneer. Her role as women's registrar was described by one of her charges as \\"to control our movements to some extent and to protect the college and the students from criticism\\". In 1907 Lucy Gwynn was summoned before the Fry Commission on Dublin University to defend the position of women at Trinity. She was supported by the parents of the students. The result was that the commission endorsed the principle of women's admission to the university. In 1922, the Dublin University Women Graduates‚Äô Association was founded, under Lucy Gwynn's presidency. Lucy Gwynn never married.

Location The Tup√© Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) is west of the city of Manaus, on the north bank of the Rio Negro about from the urban area. It includes the communities of Livramento, Juli√£o, Central, Tatu, S√£o Jo√£o do Lago do Tup√© and Agrovida. It has an area of . Vegetation includes igap√≥ and terra firma forest dominated by large trees. Tup√© beach is a sand bar at the mouth of the Tup√© stream where it enters the Rio Negro. The beach, which can only be accessed by boat, varies in width from depending on the river's water level. It provides an excellent place for swimming, diving and boating, and receives many visitors on weekends and holidays. As of 2016 the population was about 5,000. Residents say SEMMAS, the municipal environmental authority, prohibits planting crops or harvesting wood for construction. However, SEMMAS states that family-based agriculture and fishing are allowed. Efforts to develop ecotourism have not been encouraged. There are vacation homes in the reserve, mostly owned by wealthy entrepreneurs from Manaus, a source of friction with the residents. History The location was once home to indigenous people such as the Mana√≥s, now extinct, and the Tarum√£. The present residents began to occupy the region in the 1970s. In 1990 municipality declared Tup√© Beach an area of relevant ecological interest. In 1995 municipal law 321 created the Tup√© Environmental Unit. The Tup√© Sustainable Development Reserve was created in 2005 by municipal decree 8.044 to preserve the site and develop the communities through ecotourism and sustainable agriculture. It is administered by SEMMAS (Secretaria Municipal de Meio Ambiente e Sustentabilidade), a department of the municipality of Manaus. The purpose was to mitigate the environmental impacts of real estate speculation and illegal exploitation of the natural resources, and support sustainable development of the traditional residents, with emphasis on combating poverty. A draft management plan was completed in 2008, but was not approved under the administrations of successive mayors. The reserve became part of the Lower Rio Negro Mosaic, created in 2010. As of 2016 the management plan, which would define zoning and rules of use and management of natural resources, had still not been issued. This meant that the residents could not legally hunt, fish or grow crops for sale, but largely rely on government payments and occupations such as making handicrafts for sale to tourists.

Aureolaria pedicularia is native to parts of the eastern US, the Midwest, and adjacent Canada. This plant is known for its distinct leaf shape and overall plant size. The common names for Aureolaria pedicularia come from its fern-like leaves.  Introduction  Aureolaria pedicularia is a member of the family Orobanchaceae. Some common names for this plant include: fern-leaved false foxglove and fernleaf false foxglove. Aureolaria pedicularia is a hemiparasitic plant that gets some of its nutrients from a plant host. This hosts are perennial trees of the genus Quercus (oaks). Aureolaria pedicularia is recognized by its yellow petal color and distinctive fern-like leaves.  Description  Aureolaria pedicularia is a member of the genus Aureolaria. This plant has an average height from 1 foot to 4 feet, depending on the season. Aureolaria pedicularia is a root hemiparasite meaning it attaches to the roots of its hosts. Aureolaria pedicularia selectively parasitizes oaks (Quercus). Aureolaria pedicularia gets its nutrients from oak (Fagaceae). The part of the roots from the parasite (Aureolaria pedicularia) that take the nutrients from the oak selectively parasitize the favored hosts (oak). = Morphology = Aureolaria pedicularia has flowers with yellow petals. The leaves are simple, meaning they do not separate into leaflets. The leaf arrangement is opposite. There are two leaves at each attachment of a leaf on the stem or branch on the flower. The edges of the leaf blades have lobes. The flowers of Aureolaria pedicularia are bilateral. Each flower has five fused petals that form a tube. Aureolaria pedicularia also has four stamens. The fruit type for this flower is dry and splits open when it is ripe. The fruit type is a capsule. The fruit size is about 10‚Äì13 mm in length.  Taxonomy  Aureolaria pedicularia is in the family Orobanchaceae. This family is made up of 190 genera and 4,000 temperate species. Most species in the family Orobanchaceae, including Aureolaria pedicularia, are partial root parasites. Partial root parasites get their nutrients from another living plant. Species in the genus Aureolaria are also known as the false foxglove. Species in this genus are widespread over much of eastern North America. All members of this genus are root parasites. Observation was first presented by the noted American botanist Asa Gray. There are about 21 synonyms for Aureolaria pedicularia. The subspecies are Aureolaria pedicularia var. carolinensis Pennell and Aureolaria pedicularia var. ambigens Fernald. These subspecies are distinguished by physical characteristics such as glandular hairs on the leaves and other traits such as the size. The distribution and nativism for the various varieties for Aureolaria pedicularia need addition study. Two of the most common varieties ofAureolaria pedicularia's are A. pedicularia var. intercedens Pennell and A. pedicularia var. pedicularia. In North America, A. pedicularia var. intercedens is known from Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Also in North America, A. pedicularia var. pedicularia is known from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. = Taxonomic history = Rafinesque published Pantenis pedicularis (or Aureolaria) and based it on Gerardia pedicularia L. (1753). Rafinesque did not officially establish the binomial name Aureolaria pedicularia but he did use it as an alternative for the taxon Pantenis pedicularis.  Distribution and habitat  Habitats for Aureolaria pedicularia include terrestrial locations such as cliffs, balds, ledges, forests, grasslands, ridges, rocky slopes, and woodlands. This plant lives in partly shady areas to sunny areas. The soil typical for this plant is dry and sandy soil. Aureolaria pedicularia is most commonly found in open oak woods and savannas. The bloom season is from the months of May to October. The overall US distribution for Aureolaria pedicularia is throughout most of eastern North America the Great Lake states and parts of the mid-west  Uses  Aureolaria pedicularia was used by the Cherokee as a drug for antidiarrheal purposes. Also, Aureolaria pedicularia is commonly used as a food-plant by deer.  Conservation  In the state of Maine, the status for the presence of the plant Aureolaria pedicularia is considered uncommon. In the state of Vermont, it is extremely rare. In the state of Minnesota, this plant is considered threatened. One of the factors that contribute to the endangerment of Aureolaria pedicularia is the consumption of this plant by young larvae of deer. Overgrazing by deer of Aureolaria pedicularia may be a threat. Forest fires are also a threat to this species. Another factor that affects the population of Aureolaria pedicularia is the availability of its favored host, since it is a root parasite. This parasite plant uses the roots of oaks (Quercus) as a site for attachment. Without its host, Aureolaria pedicularia is not able to survive naturally because it depends on its hosts for its nutrients including sugars and proteins.

It is native to eastern Asia, and can be found as an introduced plant in the mid-Atlantic regions in the U.S from New York to Virginia. Linden arrowwood is known for the clusters of red drupes it produces when it is mature. Description Viburnum dilatatum can grow up to 3 meters tall shrub and wide. The bark of the stems are brown with some orange, the stems are pubescent, and stems change color from brown to a dark gray as they mature. The leaves are simple, arranged opposite on a branch and the shape may vary from broadly obovate, obovate, or broadly ovate. The size of the leaf ranges from long and wide. The leaves have shallowly toothed margins, usually are pubescent and they drop in late autumn. With the season change linden arrowwood foliage changes. During the summer the foliage is dark green and during the autumn season the colors vary from bronze to burgundy.Viburnum dilatatum in flower The flowers for linden arrowwood bloom after the leaves. They are in clusters that are small and the color is a creamy white, they bloom from May to early June. The flowers have both female and male parts which makes it a perfect flower. Perfect meaning they are plants that have both stamens and styles. The fruit is a red glabrous fleshy round drupe that grows in clusters like its flowers, they have red color from September to early December‚Äîan individual berry measures in diameter. The berries are called gamazumi in Japan. Taxonomy The taxonomic placement of the genus of Viburnum has been fluid in recent years. Many older sources place Viburnum in the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae). However, modern classification using molecular phylogeny places the genus in Adoxaceae. Within Adoxaceae, Viburnum is the largest clade, with 175 species. Sister species to Viburnum dilatatum are Viburnum acerifolium, Viburnum denatatum, Viburnum ellipticum, Viburnum erosum, Viburnum japonicum, Viburnum kansuense, Viburnum lobophyllum, Viburnum melanocarpum, Viburnum molle, and Viburnum rafinesquianum. Viburnum dilatatum can be confused with Viburnum dentatum. Viburnum dentatum leaves are rounder and deeply toothed and can be very pubescent or glabrous. Also, Viburnum denatum have dark purple round fruits, while Viburnum dilatatum have red round fruits. Viburnum wrightii is also often confused with Viburnum dilatatum, another ornamental plant. The difference is that Viburnum wrightii leaves are note as pubescent, and the stem and the leaves have a waxy coat. Distribution and habitat In its native range of China, Japan, and Korea, Linden arrowwood can be found in lowlands, open forests, and scrubby areas. This species thrive in moist soil and sunny areas. In the early 1800s, linden arrowwood was introduced into the United States to serve as an ornamental. This plant has spread only locally in the United States, and its populations are concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic region. In some US states where linden arrowwood is found, there have been reports of it being an invasive species. Uses Linden viburnum is an ornamental plant. It is used for mass plantings because of the white clusters of flowers it produces. Even though it is an ornamental plant, in some US states, particularly the mid-Atlantic region it is highly recommended not to plant this species because of its invasive tendencies. It is common to use the berries, leaves, and stems in Chinese medicine. The berries are used to make a soup to treat snake bites, dysentery, and vermifuge. Some studies show that the fruit has antioxidant properties in mammals. There are ongoing studies to demonstrate the potential uses of the fruit in the medical field. Ecology This species is dispersed by way of animals. The red berries attract birds, which ingest and may deposit the seeds in other areas. In the United States, Linden arrowwood is an invasive species. It is considered a threat to native species because shade the foliage produces may limit the sunlight to other plants near it. Also, Viburnum dilatatum has an advantage due to the growth of the leaves which come out in the spring and are kept until late in the fall. Countermeasures that are strongly recommend in order to decrease the reproduction of the species are to pull them out of the ground if they are under in height, or for taller plants, to cut to ground level before it fruits and spray with a herbicide in order to stop growth The seed heads from mature plants should be removed to stop dispersal. Cultivation Linden arrowwood should be grown in moist fertile soil that is slightly acidic or neutral to have best results. It needs plenty of sunlight, but will thrive in shaded areas and in warm climates. Viburnum dilatatum can easily be transplanted and will do great when established. This shrub propagates from cuttings. Seeds may need a chilling period to germinate. Planting several of these shrubs next to each other will increase the fruit production. There have not been any reports in the United States claiming this species to be harmful to fauna.

During the First Crusade, a number of key sites were captured, including Artah, which were key to the success in the Crusaders' siege of Antioch. Ralph of Caen, in his Gesta Tancredi, described Artah as the \\"shield of Antioch\\" and Godfrey of Boulogne knew that he could not attack Antioch with Artah still in enemy hands. From Marata, a detachment under Robert of Flanders went in October 1098 to the southwest to capture Artah. Robert's force numbered 1000 armed men. Their mission was aided by the Armenian Christian population that had defeated the Islamic garrison housed there. After the capture of Antioch, Bohemond, who commanded much of the fighting, took action which marked his breach with the Byzantine Empire and caused a schism between the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Latin Church. John IV, the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, was expelled and the Catholic prelate Bernard of Valence, recently appointed Bishop of Artah, was installed in his stead. Two other major battles occurred at Artah during the Crusades. The first took place in 1105 between the forces of Tancred, Prince of Galilee, and Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan, in which the Crusaders were victorious.

The common names for Verbesina occidentalis are yellow crownbeard and stick weed. Verbesina occidentalis is often considered a weedy plant of disturbed areas, due its presence in managed agricultural areas such as hayfields.  Description  The average height for Verbisina occidentalis is a meter tall. The plant has potential to grow to 2 meters in height. Verbisina occidentalis has yellow disk flowers. The number of ray flowers will range anywhere from two to five petals. The most common petal number is two. The flowers are sparse and are not evenly arranged around the head of the flower. This makes the plant looks like it is uneven or off balance. A distinctive feature of the plant is its winged stem. The plant is a perennial and will bloom during the late summer. The leaves are opposite in arrangement. The leaves are broad and ovate in shape. The leaves are typically six to twelve centimeters in length. The width of the leaves are usually eight to sixteen centimeters wide. The leaves are glabrous which gives it a smooth surface. The leaves will start to taper towards the apex. Verbesina occidentalis leaves have a serrated or toothed margin.  Distribution and habitat  Verbesina occidentalis prefers sunny habits. Verbesina occidentalis can live in partially sunny habitats but, it will not grow as well. The plant requires moderate amounts of moisture. Verbesina occidentalis needs the soil to be at least moderately nutrient. Verbesina occidentalis frequently occurs in pastures and hayfields. It can also be found at roadsides, fencerows, parking lots, creek sides and forested areas. Verbesina occidentalis is native to the United States. It is native to every southeastern state except for Arkansas. The range of the plant extends as far west as Texas and as far east as Delaware. The most northern state that Verbesina occidentalis is found in is Pennsylvania. The most southern state that Verbesina occidentalis is found in is Florida.  Taxonomy  The genus most closely related to Verbesina is Sphagneticola. Together, Verbisina and Sphagneticola form a clade. The next most closely genera are Calptocarpus and Eclipta.Verbesina alternifolia is the sister species.  Gardening  Verbesina occidentalis can be used in the home garden for insect control. Verbesina occidentalis attracts the soldier beetle. The soldier beetle is attracted to the plant for two reasons. It is believed that the soldier beetle is attracted to Verbesina occidentalis due to its coloration. The soldier beetle is also yellow and can hide among the flowers. The soldier beetle will also drink the nectar from the plant. When the soldier beetle drinks the nectar it does not harm the plant. Both the adult and larva of the soldier beetle will prey on other insects. The adult soldier beetles will eat the aphids, caterpillars, grasshopper eggs and mites. The larva of the soldier beetle hatches in the spring. The larva soldier beetles prey upon insect eggs, larva, snails, and slugs. The soldier beetle lays its eggs in the late summer.  Ecology  Verbesina occidentalis has been shown to be one of the plants that is sensitive to the rising ozone levels. Due to the rising of ozone levels Verbesina occidentalis has been shown to have foliar ozone injury. Foliar ozone injury results in visible damage to the plant. Foliar ozone injury tends to be worse in more sun exposed leaves. In the Smokey Mountain National Park approximately fifty percent of the plants sampled showed symptoms of foliar ozone injury. Approximately seventeen percent of the leaves sampled were injured. The percent of plants injured increases as the elevation increases. The stippling may become more prominent in late summer. It may begin as a few stipples that are angular in shape. The coloring of the stippling may range from a light reddish-purple to black. In prolonged cases the leaves will become yellow color and may eventually die. Verbesina occidentalis has been shown to effect the diversity of the plant community and the density of the other plants present. With the removal of Verbesina occidentalis the evenness and the Shannon diversity has been shown to increase. Shannon diversity index is a measurement of the diversity of the community. Forbs and woody plants are some the plants that are more sensitive to Verbesina occidentalis. N-fixers and grasses are also sensitive to Verbesina occidentalis.  Control  Verbesina occidentalis is considered problematic for farmers. The legume and hay field farmers seem to be some of the most negatively affected by Verbesina occidentalis due to competition. In some severe cases farmers will see a reduction in crop yields. In the past natural forms of control has been used. The use of goats for control of Verbesina occidentalis is unsuccessful since the goats will not consume the plant. The most successful form of control are herbicides. Verbesina occidentalis can be controlled at a ninety three percent rate with two pints per acre of Grazon P+D herbicide. Redeem R&P; herbicide was not as potent to Verbesina occidentalis. It took at least three pints of Redeem R&P; to achieve the ninety three percent control rate. Crossbow 2,4-D alone would control Verbesina occidentalis up to a rate of eighty three percent. However, when Benvel herbicide is used alone the control rate for Verbesina occidentalis is less than fifty percent. There are many other herbicides that have used to control Verbesina occidentalis but, none had a profound impact.

He held the position of consul of the city of Milan and was the military leader of the troops of the Lombard League during the battle of Legnano (29 May 1176). Alberto da Giussano, who according to tradition, was in command of the Lombard League, is in fact a legendary figure.  Biography  The battle of Legnano by Amos Cassioli (1860) It belonged to the noble Milanese family of the Landriani (or \\"da Landriano\\"). The first historical document that mentions Guido da Landriano is dated July 15, 1159 and refers to the incarceration he suffered during the second descent in Italy of Federico Barbarossa, when he held the post of consul of Milan. After the battle of Siziano, Guido da Landriano was imprisoned in Pavia, a city allied to the German emperor. A second mention of the Milanese consul is contained in a document dated 31 December 1167: in this act the name of Guido da Landriano appears among those of the members of the Milanese council who signed the alliance treaty signed on 22 May between the cities of Milan, Lodi, Cremona, Brescia and Bergamo. A document dated January 1176 reports instead that the office of rector of the Lombard League was covered by Guido da Landriano. Before the battle of Legnano it was decided to entrust the military command of the municipal armies to Guido da Landriano: the latter was, in addition to a shrewd politician, also an expert knight. In 1179 he became podest√† of Ferrara. In the document linked to the Piacenza negotiations (1183), which announced the peace of Constance (25 June 1183), the name of Guido da Landriano appears, among those of the municipal representatives, first. For the peace of Constance the embassies of the Italian cities were led by the consul and by Guido da Landriano. Once the dispute with Barbarossa had been resolved, Guido da Landriano withdrew from the military sphere, continuing his political career, which ended in 1190 with the appointment as podest√† of Asti.

This species is distributed across the Eastern and Midwestern USA, Eastern Canada, and Mexico.  Introduction  Cuscuta compacta is also known as compact dodder or flower love vine. The range of this parasitic plant extends from eastern Canada, the eastern and Midwestern USA to Canada. It is very common in southern Alabama and other southeastern U.S. states.  Description  The plant Cuscuta compacta is known as stem parasite with a yellowish stem that wraps around a host plant. The flowers on this plant are very small. The flowers are small and occur from clusters of four to five. The flowers have a tube or cylinder form with a size of 5mm long and 2mm wide. The sepals of the flower have obtuse tips. The corolla tips on C. compacta gradually acuminate to a sharp point. The length of the stamens are 0.3mm long and is exerted. The style of the pistil is 0.5 mm long. Scales on C. compacta are shorter than the corolla tube. Capsules are tubular in shape with a length of 3mm long and width of 2mm wide. The seeds of C. compacta are 2mm in length and are brown when fresh.  Taxonomy  The species Cuscuta compacta Juss. ex Choisy has four accepted synonyms or subspecific varieties. Synonyms are alternative names for a species. Some names attributed to Cuscuta compacta are Cuscuta compacta var. adpressa (Engelm.) Engelm, Cuscuta fruticum Bertol, Cuscuta glomerata var. adpressa (Engelm.) Choisy, and Lepidanche adpressa Engelm. The kingdom for Cuscuta compacta is Plantae. The subkingdom is Viridiplantae. The division is Tracheophyta or known as vascular plants. The class is Magnoliopsida. The order is Solanales. The family is Convolvulaceae which is also known as morning glories. Included in the family is Cuscutaceae. The genus is Cuscuta L. or known as dodder. The Species is Cuscuta compacta Juss. ex Choisy or also known as the compact dodder. The Cuscutaceae family is closely related to the Oncothecaceae family on an Angiosperm Phylogeny. C. compacta is in the Cleistogrammica section subsection Lepidanche. Two closest species related to C. compacta are, Cuscuta glomerata and Cuscuta denticulata.  Distribution and Habitat  The species Cuscuta compacta can be particularly found in the lower 48 states including Canada. The genus Cuscuta compacta has been identified in Africa, Europe, South America, China, and Australia. Cuscuta compacta can be seen wrapped around their host plants during the months of July through November. Its habitat consists of bottomland forests near stream banks. Other locations are marshes, swamps, and any wet habitats. Cuscuta compacta can parasitize both herbaceous and but especially specialize on woody hosts. Cuscuta is highly diverse being found all over the world yet majority of this genus is in the Americas.  Parasitism  C. compacta is a heterotrophic parasitic plant meaning they attach themselves around other plants and remove their nutrients. As compact dodders age over time, it does not grow any roots. Instead of growing roots, it produces a slender shoot that develops into tendrils. Although it takes time, the tendrils begin to bend and move in different directions until it has attached itself to a host. In a controlled lab environment Cuscuta compacta can attach itself to many host at one time. Yet in the wild, this species C. compacta appears to be more selective for hosts.  Germination  Germination occurs when the embryo begins to grow and bursts from the seed coat. Then the process begins only after the seed absorbs water. The embryo then starts to use the stored food to grow and develop the radicle facing the [null ground][l1]. In order for Cuscuta compacta to germinate the ambient temperature needs to be 22 C to 23 C (71.6 F to 73.4 F).  Economic Impact  In North Carolina blueberry growers have reported Cuscuta compacta as an agronomic pest. Notably, C. compacta specializes on woody hosts such as blueberry bushes (Vaccinium spp.) The multiple basal shoots on blueberry bushes may facilitates parasitism by C. compacta. Ditches associated with wetlands may be responsible for Cuscuta seed dispersal or possibly birds.  Hosts  Cuscuta compacta uses herbaceous hosts but specializes on woody or semi-woody plants. Reported hosts of C. compacta: Acer, Alnus, Amelopsis, Apios, Aster, Baccharis, Bignonia, Boehmeria, Campsis, Carpinus, Cephalantbus, Cyrilla, Diespyrus, Elephatopus, Eupatorium, Gelsemium, Halesia, Hypericum, Ilex, Idea, Iva, Lespedeza, Leucotboe, Ludwigia, Myrica, Nyssa, Rubus, Sambucus, Sapium, Sassafras, Saururus, Smilax, Vaccinium, Viburnum.

A moleculary phylogeny shows H. sibthorpioides to be closely related to H. americana, H. bonariensis, H. bowlesioides, H. hirsute, and H. umbellata, among others.  Distribution and habitat  Hydrocoytle sibthorpioides is most commonly found in southeastern Asia. Although is native to Asia, there are parts of the United States where this plant thrives as an introduced species, particularly in the eastern US, and some areas in California. Recently, H. sibthorpioides has been reported to flourish in southeast Australia, where it occurs in Brisbane and Sydney. However this plant is not found in Western Australia. This species is able to grow in a wide variety of habitats, from dry areas to locations which are occasionally submerged. It can also be found between sidewalk cracks, and is increasingly occurring as a lawn weed.  Culture  For the plant to reach its full growth it must have full sunlight. It can tolerate temperatures between 10 and 30 degrees Celsius but grows best when the temperature stays between 20 and 28 degrees Celsius. It has a pH soil preference that ranges from 5 to 7. The propagation for this plant is mostly by cuttings.  Conservation status  The conservation status for Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides is of least concern; it continues to grow and spread throughout the United States along with other regions of the world such as Australia.  Medical uses  Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides is used to treat asthma in areas of Nepal. Bengali villagers use the entire plant to help heal bone fractures.

The plant is native in the Americas in temperate zones but has been introduced to other parts of the world. The species is often confused with other Juncus plants due to morphological similarity. Juncus dichotomus often is found in areas which prove to be very moist, and rainfall is a common occurrence. Juncus dichotomus is often most recognizable in the spring and summer months of the year due to its conspicuous flowers and infructescence. This plant can be difficult to identify due in part to its similar appearance to other Juncus species. Often Juncus dichotomus is overlooked because it is inconspicuous in the field, and some can be difficult to identify and some consider Juncus dichotomus a weed.  Description  Juncus dichotomus is a graminoid, i.e., a grass-like plant. Juncus dichotomus belongs to the monocot group in which it is a member of a Juncaceae family otherwise known as the rushes. While this species of rush is not tall and lacks many distinctive features making it especially hard to identify by non-specialists. In North America July through August is when Juncus dichotomus is most frequently observed. Juncus dichotomus can occur in dry sites but it thrives best in soils that are damp, such as a roadside ditches where runoff is frequent.  Habitat/distribution  Juncus dichotomus is native and distributed widely in the Americas in temperate zones but has been reported as introduced in other temperate climate zones. Juncus dichotomus is a more specialized species least temporarily wet habitats: riverbanks, pond margins, depressions in heaths, sometimes also near rice fields. Flowering and fruiting occurs in late spring‚Äîsummer in ditches, shores, clearings, and other typically open areas, usually in sandy, well- drained (but frequently wet) soil. Juncus dichotomus usually grows in sandy soils. Any habitat that hold sufficient groundwater with stable temperate temperatures, then this location has the capability to hold a population of J. dichotomus.  Taxonomy  . Juncus dichotomus is considered perennial herbs to 10 dm. Rhizomes densely branched to short creeping. Cataphylls 1--3. Leaves basal; auricles 0.2--0.5(--0.6) mm, scarious to leathery; blade nearly terete, channeled or flat, 10‚Äì25(--40) cm(0.5--)0.7--1(--1.2) mm, margins entire. Inflorescences terminal, (5--)10‚Äì85(--100)-flowered, congested to somewhat loose, (1--)2.5--10‚Äì13) cm; primary bract usually exceeding inflorescence. Flowers: bracteoles 2; tepals green, lanceolate, (3--)3.3--4.5(--5.5) mm; outer and inner series nearly equal; stamens 6, filaments 0.6--1.2 mm, anthers 0.4--0.8(--1) mm; style 0.2 mm. Capsules tan to brown, 1-locular to pseudo-3-locular, ellipsoid to widely. Seeds brownish to amber, ellipsoid to lunate, 0.3--0.4 mm, not tailed. 2n = ca. 80.  Uses  The uses for Juncus dichotomus are limited. Since the plant is often found next to or near water sources which may play a role in preventing erosion.  Management  Juncus dichotomus, a native of the Americas, is also now being reported as invasive in Europe. Juncus dichotomous has been confused with Juncus tenuis, a very widespread plant, in Europe which may have contributed to its spread there. Throughout the southeastern United States and some Northeastern parts on the US found there dichotomus is common. Systemic rusts and smuts have a major effect on individual plants and populations as they affect growth and survival and diseased plants may become distorted, stunted and/or elongated although the results are variable. More work on the life history of J. dichotomus is required to better understand how it responds to disease and other abiotic factors. Management of this species as an invasive in Europe is unclear, although water regime is important and may be manipulated to control the plant as well as herbicides  History  It is clear that Juncus dichotomus has increased its range substantially due to human aided dispersal. Although the biogeographic history of J. dichotomus is somewhat unclear due in part to its similarities with other graminoid species.

Synonyms for Carex rosea include Carex concoluta, and Carex flaccidula. It is native to central and eastern North America and it exists in wet to dry soils. Carex rosea can be found in shores of streams and bottomlands, as well as ponds. It is known to have great adaptations to dry- shade locations. This is an evergreen, easy-to-grow-plant.  Description  Carex rosea flowers in the spring, and it has evergreen leaves. The styles of this Carex roseae, the stalk connecting the stigma to the ovary, are very distinctively curled, which helps to differentiate this species from other plants. The stigmas range from 0.07-0.10 millimeters thick, while the leaves are almost 1/8 millimeters wide. The width of the stem leaf blade ranges from 1.8-2.6 millimeters. The lowest bract either has no sheath or the sheath it has is very short up to four millimeters in length. The lowest spike is not borne on a peduncle, which is a stalk that supports inflorescence growth to more than one flower. The uppermost spike contains both carpels and stamens, with the carpels located below, or mixed in, with the stamens. The membrane that encloses the flower has no hairs and its length varies between 2.6 and 4.2 millimeters. The leaf sheath has no pink, red, or purple tinting and the leaf blade can either be, smooth and hairless, or rough and sandpapery. The leaves are all produced from the base of the plant, and the one-seeded fruit, usually ranging from 1.6-2.2 millimeters, has no folds or dimples. The spikelets found in the plant are widely spread rather than clustered together, and the culms consist of about 4-8 spikelets. Spikelets are green because of the presence of 7-14 spreading perigynia. The overall average height is about 1 millimeter tall.  Taxonomy  Carex rosea is the type of the Carex rosea species group. While some characters seem to be unreliable for the separation of each species, other characters, like the width of the broadest leaves, the shape of the perigynium base, and the fertile culms, are reliable. Different analysis of the mixed populations have concluded that hybridization between the species does not occur. According to results from a complete ITS sequence based phylogeny, Carex rosea is sister to Carex radiata, Carex retroflexa, Carex texensis, and Carex socialis. This plant is primarily confused with Carex radiata. Typically Carex rosea occurs in drier sites and has slightly narrower leaves.  Distribution and habitat  Carex rosea distribution is in essentially the eastern portion of North America. Its habitat is in dry-moist woodlands. It can adapt to various soil types and it can also live in rich ravines, and wood edges. In Canada, C. rosea is distributed from Nova Scotia and southern Quebec west to MN and eastern NE.  Ecology  Carex rosea can complete its life cycle in a little more than two years. Even though the genus Carex has been considered nonmycorrhizal, recent evidence has demonstrated that mycotrophy may be more spread among the sedges than realized.  Horticulture  Plants that have already been established to a place are highly drought-tolerant. Carex rosea is unappetizing to deer and other herbivores. Many times Carex rosea, or sedge in general, are used as ground covers. This is a way to help with the maintenance of green expanses near houses since it is an evergreen plant. It is recommended for the plant to be cut completely off before the winter season starts. The more highly adaptable sedges grow in warm-weather conditions and if mowing the land is a choice, then it is recommended to do it only a few times a year, compared to regular grass which is almost every other week.  Conservation status  The IUCN indicates that this species has not been assessed. However, no potential threats are known to Carex rosea. This plant is widely distributed and common.

With the arrival of Telli Hasan Pasha as the Beylerbey of the Bosnia Eyalet in 1591, a period of peace established between Emperor Rudolf II and Sultan Murad III ended and the provincial Ottoman armies launched an offensive on Croatia. Bihaƒá, a nearly isolated city on the Una River that repelled an Ottoman attack in 1585, was one of the first targets. Thomas Erd≈ëdy, the Ban of Croatia, used available resources and soldiers to protect the border towns, but the Ottomans managed to take several smaller forts in 1591. As the offensive gained pace, the Croatian Parliament passed a law on a general uprising in the country on 5 January 1592. In early June 1592 Hasan Pasha led his troops towards Bihaƒá, which was defended by around 500 soldiers and commanded by Captain Joseph von Lamberg. The siege lasted from 10 June to 19 June, when Lamberg surrendered the city due to a lack of reinforcements and an insufficient number of defending troops. Lamberg was for this act later tried for treason. Although under the terms of the surrender its citizens were to be allowed to leave or remain in the city without harm, more than 2,000 civilians were killed and 800 were taken captive after Hasan Pasha's troops entered Bihaƒá. The offensive lasted until June 1593 when Hasan Pasha was killed in the Battle of Sisak, which was the cause for the Long Turkish War (1593-1606). Background thumbCroatia and Ottoman expansion in the region in 1591 From the 1520s the Ottoman advance into Croatia gained pace. The Croatian nobles elected Ferdinand I of Habsburg at the Parliament on Cetin in 1527 as the new monarch, but continuous Ottoman incursions resulted in a significant loss of territory. In 1537 the fall of Klis meant the loss of the last Croatian stronghold in the south of the country. In the 1540s the Ottomans advanced into Slavonia and in the next three decades through western Bosnia in the direction of Zagreb. By the late 16th century Croatia lost two thirds of its pre-war area and more than half of the population. It was reduced to 16,800 km¬≤ of free territory and had around 400,000 inhabitants. The remaining land was referred to as the \\"remnants of remnants of the once great and renowned Kingdom of Croatia\\" (). Numerous ceasefires were signed or renewed between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy, but they were not respected by local Sanjak-beys. Depending on the weather conditions and available military forces they conducted raids without taking into account a truce. Uskoks, irregular soldiers in Croatia, responded with their own raids into Ottoman-held territory. Ottoman authorities settled Vlachs, mainly of Orthodox faith, on the conquered territory and used them as auxiliary units in their wars. In 1578 Archduke Charles II decided to respond to Ottoman attacks with an offensive to push the frontier back to the Una River. The offensive began in August and the joint Austrian-Croatian troops took back Cazin, Zrin, and Ostrovica, but they were stopped at Bu≈æim and pushed back to the north, losing all gains. Bihaƒá remained basically isolated on the Una River. To strengthen the southern defences the construction of Karlovac as a city-fortress began in 1579. The string of garrisoned forts at the border became known as the Croatian Military Frontier. =The role of Bihaƒá= Following the fall of Knin in 1522 Bihaƒá took the leading role in the Kingdom of Croatia south of the Sava River. It became an important stronghold that protected the area from the Croatian Littoral to the lands around the Una River. From the times of King Matthias Corvinus a garrison was stationed in the city. In 1528 Bihaƒá became a center of a captaincy due to its position near the border with the Ottoman Empire and a relatively large number of residents. There were 25 forts under the command of the Bihaƒá Captain in 1576. However, the number of forts was reduced to only three by 1579: Ripaƒç, Sokol, and Izaƒçiƒá. The rest were either conquered by the Ottomans or were included into the Slunj captaincy. By the 1580s the city was in a dire state. It was almost surrounded by Ottoman territory, villages in its vicinity were abandoned and there were frequent reports of food shortages. Many of its citizens fled the city and there was a large influx of refugees into Bihaƒá from nearby places that were conquered by the Ottomans. =1585 siege and aftermath= In 1584 the Ottomans suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Slunj against the forces of Ban Erd≈ëdy. This defeat calmed the situation on the border as Ottoman commanders put a halt on their raids. Erd≈ëdy used that time to strengthen the border fortifications and called a session of the Croatian Parliament on 11 March 1585. A decision was made to complete the work on Fort Brest near Sisak and the construction of a new tower in ≈†i≈°inec on the Kupa River. As the country was affected by a drought in summer, the rivers were drained which made it easier for Ottoman forces to cross into Croatian territory. Ferhad Pasha Sokoloviƒá, Beylerbey of the Bosnia Eyalet, prepared an army for an attack on Bihaƒá and its surrounding forts. On 14 September 1585 Ferhad Pasha besieged Bihaƒá, but did not have enough infantryman at his disposal. The defenders of the town, commanded by Captain Franz Horner, used their artillery and inflicted heavy losses on the Ottomans, forcing Ferhad Pasha to lift the siege on the following day. The Ottomans burned several nearby villages during their departure. Local sanjakbeys then turned north and started attacking forts in Slavonia. Ali-beg, Sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Pakrac, was killed in the Battle of Ivaniƒá in 1586. Following an Ottoman defeat near Nagykanizsa in 1587, a relatively lengthy period of peace began on the border. There were no clashes in 1588 and 1589, besides an unsuccessful Ottoman attack on Senj. On 29 November 1590 a truce was renewed between Emperor Rudolf II and Sultan Murad III. =Renewal of hostilities= Contrary to an agreement to extend the truce, with the arrival of belligerent Telli Hasan Pasha (Hasan Pasha Predojeviƒá) as the beylerbey of the Eyalet of Bosnia in early 1591, tensions once again increased along the border between Croatia and the Ottoman Empire. Hasan Pasha immediately began to gather an army around Banja Luka and prepared for an offensive on Croatia. Croatian Ban Thomas Erd≈ëdy expected attacks on Bihaƒá and Sisak. Discussing the situation at a session of the Croatian Parliament on 26 July 1591, the nobles concluded that in the case of a large scale invasion, a general uprising was to be called, and that all the nobles and citizens, as well as their subordinates, should answer the call. On 1 August 1591 Hasan Pasha attacked Sisak. The city's position was crucial as it defended the left bank of the Kupa River, but also the approach to Zagreb. Upon hearing of the siege of Sisak, Ban Thomas Erd≈ëdy sent help to the city and Hasan Pasha was forced to retreat on 11 August. Erd≈ëdy then led a counterattack and took back the town of Moslavina on 12 August. This angered Hasan Pasha and he requested the High Porte to cancel the truce and declare war on the Habsburg Monarchy. He ordered the imprisonment of commanders that surrendered Moslavina and sent them to Istanbul. In November the Ottomans captured Ripaƒç on the Una River, south of Bihaƒá. On 5 January 1592 the Croatian Parliament passed a law on a general uprising for the defence of the homeland. Nobility, small landowners, military nobility (armalists), and citizens were obliged to report to the ban's camp or risk losing all lands and property. The nobility had to equip and arm two infantryman and one cavalryman for every ten households, while richer merchants had to equip one cavalryman. All royal and free cities had to ensure wagons and carts to transport weapons and ammunition. The law also regulated mandatory provision of food from serfs for the army, which was stored in Zagreb. Prelude A map of the Kingdom of Croatia from 1593, depicting the Ottoman-Croatian wars and the Ottoman assault on Bihaƒá (Wyhitz) After an unsuccessful siege of Sisak, the Ottomans were preparing to capture a stronghold near Sisak and make it a base for their further incursions into Croatia. On 14 April Hasan Pasha started building the fort of Petrinja south of Brest. Material for its construction was prepared in advance and the fort was finished on 2 May. As he expected an attack on Bihaƒá, Captain Kri≈°tof Obriƒçan ordered the strengthening of city's defences in spring, but he was soon captured by the Ottomans while he supervised the work outside the city walls. Captain Josip Dornberg was appointed in his place, but as he was absent the command was temporarily given to Captain Joseph von Lamberg. At Lamberg's request, reinforcements numbering a hundred Uskoks arrived from Karlovac with food and ammunition. These were the last reinforcements Bihaƒá received. Siege A 1592 publication in Vienna about the battle In early June, Hasan Pasha raised an army and headed to Bihaƒá with 5,000 soldiers and a large number of cannons. The first part of the Ottoman troops arrived near Bihaƒá on 10 June and encamped at the Pokoj hill north of it. Three days later the main army arrived led by Hasan Pasha and started encircling Bihaƒá. Hasan Pasha detached a part of them to capture Izaƒçiƒá, the last remaining Christian-held settlement between Bihaƒá and the Korana River. Izaƒçiƒá was defended by Ga≈°par Babonoziƒá who had 16 soldiers at his disposal. They held out the first attack, but left the town on 14 June and fled to Slunj. The Bihaƒá garrison was commanded by Captain Joseph Lamberg. The garrison numbered between 400 and 500 soldiers, mostly regular Croatian soldiers, Uskoks, and German mercenaries, as well as several hundred militiamen. Around 5,000 civilians were located in the city. Lamberg sent a letter to Colonel Andreas von Auersperg on 12 June asking for military aid. He sent another letter to Auersperg on 13 June and rejected Hasan Pasha's demand for the surrender of the city. Auersperg's deputy, Captain Juraj Paradeiser, feared for the safety of Karlovac and therefore did not send help. He forwarded the request to the Carniolian nobles, however they did not believe that the threat to Bihaƒá was serious. To keep up the morale of his troops and Bihaƒá's citizens, Lamberg organized a public oath on 13 June where they pledged to defend the city to the last man. By the end of 13 June Bihaƒá was completely surrounded and Lamberg could not send couriers past the Ottoman lines. Hasan Pasha organized his artillery into three groups and deployed it around Bihaƒá, so they were able to shell it from all directions. The bombardment of the city began on 14 June, which could be heard in Slunj 25 miles (40 km) away. The first phase of it did not cause significant damage to the walls, but the sheer number of cannons and the lack of reinforcements caused fear in the city and the loss of hope in the possibility of its defence. On 19 June Hasan Pasha ordered an infantry assault on the fortress. As the first siege ladders reached the walls, Bihaƒá's judges and councilors asked Lamberg to start negotiations with Hasan Pasha, saying that the defenders were too weak to withstand the assault and there were no reinforcements. Lamberg was compelled to negotiate an honourable surrender and together with three judges went to Hasan Pasha's tent. Ottoman conditions were an immediate surrender of Bihaƒá, but they assured that its citizens would be allowed to leave with their property or remain and acknowledge Ottoman rule. Lamberg agreed to it and on the same day Ottoman forces entered Bihaƒá. =Sack of the city= Anonymous modern representation of the successful assault on the Habsburg Croatian fortified town of Bihaƒá (Bihka in Ottoman Turkish) by the Ejalet-i Bosna Ottoman provincial forces led by Gazi Hasan-pa≈°a Predojeviƒá, in 1592. Lamberg, his soldiers and their families were escorted by several hundred cavalrymen towards Slunj. When the column moved away from the city, the Ottomans started looting them and killed most of the refugees. Only Lamberg and several men managed to flee and reach Brest. Lamberg and the surviving defenders were later tried by court-martial for surrendering Bihaƒá. A majority of the population was reluctant to leave their homes and decided to stay in Bihaƒá. However, Hasan Pasha did not hold up his end of the deal and the city was sacked. In the first days following the capture more than 2,000 citizens were killed, while 800 children were taken captive and sent to Istanbul. A contemporary news article (Zeitung) from Vienna about the battle reported that 5,000 Christians were killed. Aftermath and legacy Fethija (\\"conquered\\") Together with captives from the Battle of Brest, the prisoners from Bihaƒá were taken to Istanbul, where a triumphant celebration was held in honour of the victory. Wagons were carrying 172 captives and 22 flags captured in Brest and Bihaƒá to the High Porte. Hasan Pasha also sent paintings of Bihaƒá and Slunj to the Sultan, though he did not manage to seize Slunj. The Habsburg imperial envoy in Istanbul prote for the cruelty of Hasan Pasha's forces and in the name of the Emperor asked for the return of Bihaƒá. The Ottomans responded that \\"every reasonable person can figure out that Bihaƒá can not be returned\\", as a mosque was already built in it and prayers for the Padishah were held. The fall of Bihaƒá caused fear in Croatia as it stood on the border for decades. It was the last Croatian stronghold in the south and with its fall the defensive line moved north and extended from Ogulin, through Karlovac and along the Kupa River to Sisak. During its spring-summer offensive of 1592, the Ottoman Empire seized Bihaƒá and Ripaƒç on the Una River, and Dreznik, Floriana, and Cetingrad on the Korana River. Thus the Ottomans rounded the area around Bihaƒá and made it the starting point of their further offensives. The town of Karlovac assumed the role of Bihaƒá as the most important fort on the border. Pope Clement VIII, who was elected Pope in February of the same year, was distressed after hearing news of the fall of Bihaƒá. He proposed a league against the Ottoman Empire, but it was rejected by the Signoria of Venice. From July to October 1592 the raids of Hasan Pasha into Bohemia, Croatia, and Hungary resulted in the capture of 35,000 people. A month after the fall of Bihaƒá, on 19 July the Ottomans defeated the forces of Ban Erd≈ëdy in the Battle of Brest. In 1593 Hasan Pasha directed his forces towards Sisak, where he suffered a heavy defeat on 22 June and was killed in action. The Battle of Sisak triggered the Long War that lasted until the Peace of Zsitvatorok on 11 November 1606. The Church of Saint Anthony of Padua was converted to a mosque and renamed to Fethija, meaning conquered. It is notable for containing the epitaphs and graves of the Croatian noblemen who died protecting the city.Fethija d≈æamija sa haremom, devet grobnih ploƒça i natpisima, graditeljska cjelina ‚Äì ƒålanak.

The book was initially published by Zed Books in 2001, and a revised and updated version was published in 2011. Translated versions were also published in Spanish, French and Chinese. The book is suitable for a general reader, and uses words and figures rather than equations to make its points, but is aimed at those with at least some basic knowledge of economics.  Description  The book strongly criticises many of the key ideas and assumptions of neoclassical economics. It argues that components of the theory such as demand curves, which are supposed to represent the aggregate behaviour of consumers, are theoretical constructs that have little empirical support. Keen questions the conventional theory of the firm, arguing that monopolies can have a useful role. He also revisits the Cambridge capital controversy of the 1960s to argue that ideas such as capital and profit are ill-defined. One of the book‚Äôs main critiques is that macroeconomic models or theories such as the efficient- market hypothesis rely on the assumption that the economy can be viewed as being at or near equilibrium. But according to Keen, this is an over- simplification of the way that the real economy behaves. He argues that economists need to become more familiar with the mathematical tools needed to study dynamical systems, such as nonlinear differential equations. The final section gives a discussion of possible alternatives, such as Marxian economics, Austrian economics, complexity economics, and so on. Keen concludes that, while none of these theories are completely satisfactory, pursuing them may lead to a more realistic understanding of the economy. Reviews In his review of the book, economist John Quiggin wrote: > ‚Äú[W]hile Keen has made some important critical points, his claim to have > ‚Äòdebunked‚Äô economics seems premature. On the whole, the most promising > response to the problems identified by Keen would seem to be the continued > development of more sophisticated and realistic approaches to mainstream > economics, and the cultivation of an openminded and skeptical view of the > world, in which economic theories are seen as tools to aid understanding > rather than as bodies of received revelation.‚Äù In The Review of Austrian Economics, economists Robert Murphy and Gene Callaham wrote that ‚Äúin his zeal to attack mainstream economics, Keen often overshoots.‚Äù However they conclude that ‚ÄúKeen is raising important questions, even if we cannot go along with him on all of his answers.‚Äù Economist Peter Kriesel described the book as \\"an important book for the non-economist to help understand the limitations and shortcomings of the orthodox neoclassical doctrines which drive most policy and much of the study of economics. However, the reader needs to beware, as some of the arguments are overcomplicated, and some of the claims against the orthodoxy are too extreme.\\" In an article about the revised 2011 edition, George Monbiot wrote that \\"the graphs and figures it contains provide a more persuasive account of the causes of the crash and of its likely evolution than anything that has yet emerged from Constitution Avenue or Threadneedle Street.\\" References  External links  * Debunking Economics (revised and extended version), webpage maintained by the publisher, Zed Books.

The Mailvelope-based OpenPGP system of United Internet integrates such functionality and its usability earned some positive mentions in the press, particularly the offered key synchronization feature. A usability analysis from 2016 found it to still be \\"worthy of improvement\\" (\\"verbesserungsw√ºrdig\\"), though, and mentioned \\"confusing wording\\" (\\"irritierende Formulierungen\\"), missing communication of the concept, bad password recommendations, missing negative dissociation of the more prominent modus that features only transport encryption, plus insufficient support for key authenticity checking (to thwart man-in-the- middle attacks).  Usage  In April 2015, De-Mail providers equipped their services with an option for end-to-end encryption based on Mailvelope that is deactivated by default and can only be used in combination with Mobile TAN or the German electronic identity card. In contrast to the hitherto advertised but ineffective encryption scheme De-Mail some of the same email providers now promise their customers end-to-end encrypted communication among authenticated participants without the need for expert knowledge. In August 2015, the E-Mail services of Web.de and GMX introduced support for OpenPGP encryption and integrated a customized version of Mailvelope into their webmail applications for that. According to self-published figures, this affected about 30 million users.  Functionality  It implements the OpenPGP standard, a public-key cryptosystem first standardized in 1998. It's a web browser extension written in JavaScript for Firefox or Chromium (Chrome). On certain web pages it overlays its control elements which are optically distinguished as being separate from the web application by a surrounding background of tiled lock symbols. This background can be customized to enable recognizing imitations. In the back end it builds on the functionality of the program library OpenPGP.js, a free JavaScript Implementation of the OpenPGP standard. By running inside a separate inline frame, its code is executed separately from the web application and should prevent it from accessing clear text message contents. The version developed in collaboration with 1&1 silently creates a pair of keys when using a setup wizard and manages all OpenPGP keys locally in the browser.  History  The developer names the defunct software project FireGPG that was started in 2007 as an important predecessor. Thomas Obernd√∂rfer started developing Mailvelope in spring 2012 and the first publication was version 0.4.0.1 on August 24. Mario Heiderich and Krzysztof Kotowicz of Cure53 did a security audit on an alpha version from 2012/2013. Among other things, the separation from the web application and its data structures was enhanced based on its findings. In February 2014, the same group analysed the library OpenPGP.js which Mailvelope is based on. Version 0.8.0 from the following April included the corrections that stem from it and brought about support for signing messages. In May 2014, iSEC Partners published an analysis of the Firefox extension. Version 1.0.0 was published on August 18, 2015. The webmail software Roundcube senses and supports Mailvelope as of version 1.2 from May 2016.

During her collegiate career at Francis Marion University, Moore established herself as one of the most prolific scorers in college history, male or female, and is the all-time career-scoring leader in women's college basketball. In 1979, she began her WBL career, playing with the New York Stars, then, the following season, Moore joined the St. Louis Streak. Moore was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. Biography Born in Florence, South Carolina, Moore began playing basketball while attending Wilson High School where she was in the starting line-up for all four years, and achieved early success, earning the MVP award at the 1975 and 1976 AAU Junior Olympic Games. Moore, who commenced her collegiate career with Anderson Junior College for one semester (where she amassed 177 points in eight games), transferred to Francis Marion University, and, because of AIAW rules, she was immediately eligible to play the remainder of the 1975‚Äì76 season for the campus's team, the Patriots. Patriots head coach Sylvia Hatchell reflected on Moore's unique ability to score: \\"She was outside, inside, she could handle the ball, draw fouls. I saw her wait for the defense to catch up with her so she could draw the foul and make a 3-point play. She was ahead of her time\\". During her junior year, Moore posted a then single- game record 60 points in a victory over Eastern Washington State College in the 1978 AIAW Small College National Tournament. On March 10, 1979, in her final collegiate game, Moore scored 42 points against the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga to break the previous all-time record of 4,045 career points, previously set by Travis Grant of Kentucky State University. Overall, Moore averaged 30.6 points per game during her stint at Francis Marion, scored a total of 4,061 points in an era where the three-point arc was not incorporated into women's basketball, and helped lead the Patriots to three national championship appearances. Throughout her career with Francis Marion, Moore always scored in double-figures, and posted less than 20 points in only 18 of her total 128 games, which both testify to her dominance offensively. Moore graduated from Francis Marion in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in sociology. She was subsequently selected in the first round by the New York Stars in the Women's Professional Basketball League draft. In her first professional season, the Stars concluded their regular schedule with the highest winning-percentage in the league. Despite a 36-point game from \\"Machine Gun\\" Molly Bolin of the Iowa Cornets, the Stars won the championship series behind a 27-point effort by Moore.Bradley, Robert. \\"HISTORY OF THE WOMEN'S PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL LEAGUE\\", Association for Professional Basketball Research. Accessed October 11, 2016. She played another season, joining the St. Louis Streak, and participated in the 1981 WBL All-Star Game. When the WBL folded, Moore played the final season of her professional career with the Foreign Pro League of Venezuela. Following her pro career, Moore coached high-school teams. She has received recognition for her accomplishments in women's basketball with her induction into the FMU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Women's Hall of Fame in 2011. Michael Hawkins, who nominated Moore for the latter honor, called her one of college basketball's most prolific scorers and the best player Francis Marion ever produced. Moore currently hosts her own girls' basketball camp.

Background Cowan was born in Due West, South Carolina, the son of planter and merchant Captain John Cowan. He attended the local public schools and graduated from Erskine College before studying law in the state of Georgia. He was admitted to practice before the Georgia Supreme Court in 1882 and then moved to Arizona the same year, settling in Kingman. Kingman and first term in Legislature There he continued to practice law, and had interests in cattle ranching and mining. He moved to San Diego, California for a brief time before returning to Kingman and being elected a Probate Judge, serving in that position for four years and simultaneously he was the superintendent of county schools. He served as the clerk of the District Court of Mohave County for four years, and clerk of the Board of Supervisors. In 1895 he was elected Mohave County Recorder and in 1897 elected to the upper house of the 19th Arizona Territorial Legislature from Mohave County. Near the end of the session, tensions grew between the House of Representatives and Governor Benjamin Joseph Franklin, a gold Democrat in a predominately free silver territory, leading Cowan to sponsor a resolution declaring \\"the best interests of the territory demanded an immediate change in the office of governor.\\" The resolution was opposed in the Council which proclaimed it \\"has implicit confidence in the integrity and ability of our present governor.\\" Tucson and second term in Legislature In 1898, he moved to Tucson and was elected to the 22nd legislature in 1902 representing Pima County. =Cowan Bill= Acting upon a recommendation by Governor Brodie, he introduced what came to be known as the Cowan Bill which raised significant revenue for Arizona. Under the original laws of the territory, the territorial secretary, who approved and recorded articles of incorporation for companies incorporating in the territory, was entitled to keep the fees charged as part of his salary. The secretary at the time, Isaac T. Stoddard was receiving an estimated $40,000 per year (about $ per year in present-day terms) in fees, and he had built a side business that assisted foreign businesses to incorporate under Arizona law. His earnings were harshly criticized. The bill made incorporation fees revenue to the territory treasury. The Cowan Bill passed in the state assembly 13 to 5, despite Stoddard's active opposition. By 1905, Arizona was receiving over $50,000 per year in incorporation fees. Later life Cowan was the Tucson city recorder for twenty-two years beginning in 1910, which at the time made him also the city clerk and a city police court judge. Personal Cowan married Rosalie Rice Ogden of California in December 1883 with whom he had two daughters, Florence and Edith. In 1888, he opened Kingman Soda Works and manufactured sodas including sarsaparilla, ginger ale and soda water. He lost part of his thumb when closing the breech of his gun on it while attempting to shoot a large cat. He was also a partner with US Senator Marcus A. Smith in a Sonora, Mexico copper mine. The pair were awarded possession of the mining claim by the Supreme Court of Mexico in 1904, after losing cases in lower courts, and regained the claim from three Mexican claim jumpers. Cohen died July 20, 1933 in Tucson and was buried at Evergreen Memorial Park.

Further it is to ensure economic security and fight terrorism on national and international level, transnational organized crime and international crime as well as carry out measures towards prevention, detection and suppression of corruption. It is also responsible for protecting state secrets. The newly established independent agency is a former subordinate branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia and has been re-activated in 2015.http://ssg.gov.ge/en/page/aboutus/infohttps://jamestown.org/program/georgia- establishes-new-state-security-service/ History Having its roots in the Soviet Union, in the 1940s, the State Security Service was originally the Ministry of State Security of the Georgian SSR and was repeatedly reformed and merged with the Ministry of Internal Affairs over the course of several decades before both ministries ultimately merged in 2003. Before the Georgian declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the Republic had its own republican intelligence agency on the basis of the Committee for State Security (KGB), which was notable in part because the Georgian KGB was considered by the party leadership to be the most effective of regional branches of the KGB. The Georgian KGB was under the notable 30 year rule of Aleksi Inauri and Givi Gumbaridze for most of its existence.Cherkashin, Victor & Feifer, Gregory (2005), Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer, p. 125. Basic Books, . Until 2015 the State Security Agency was an integral part of the MIA and its primary intelligence as well as counterintelligence component. In the fight against terrorism, however, Georgia lacked a uniform coordinated force as many law enforcement units and government agencies claimed counter terrorism as their area of responsibility, despite the fact a specialised and designated anti-terror unit had already existed for many years. In order to unify the efforts of all institutions, an interagency mechanism was established in 2014 that would operate as a joint task force subordinated to a crisis management council in the event of major terrorist attacks.United States Department of Statehttp://www.osce.org/fsc/233731?download=true Nonetheless, as a result of the rapidly increasing threat of international terrorism, the Georgian government decided to reinstate the State Security Service as a separate and independent agency and task it with priority counter terrorism related missions and activities. For this task the country's most elite counter terror unit has been transferred to the SSSG for all operative measures. Fields of activities =Counter terrorism= The fight against terrorism is one of the main priorities of the SSSG notably due to recent developments in the Middle East. Georgia has been participating in the War on Terror from the beginning and has to some extent found itself increasingly becoming a transit country for combatants and potential Islamic terrorists as violence keeps continuously rising in the conflicted Arab nations.http://dfwatch.net/georgians-mentioned-in-leaked-islamic-state- documents-41956United States Department of State Even though the likelihood of a terrorist attack may be minimal to the country itself, such activities undermine and endanger the political and military efforts of allied and partner nations thus why Georgias efforts in those areas are essential to not only regional security. If direct operational and surgical means are required to effectively deter and combat terrorist threats the agency deploys two special units - one of which is part of the Special Operations Division and operates primarily on domestic level to contain individuals or entire cells that conduct radical activities which endanger national security.http://ssg.gov.ge/en/news/73/Counterterrorism-Center-under-the-State- Security-Service-of-Georgia-detained-4-persons The Counterterrorism Center is the primary division dominantly engaged in anti-terror warfare and fields the country's most experienced and designated force in that area. In accordance to their tasks and activities the members of its tactical intervention force regularly train and retrain on all forms of combat particularly in connection with counter terrorism including among other, special sniper courses, alpine warfare, special CQB training, the search and destruction of terrorist camps, specialization on explosive devices, their defusal and deploying means to prevent and counteract the use of weapons of mass destruction. The center operates in conjunction with the nations own and foreign intelligence services including Interpol. Each of its operator undergoes foreign courses in cooperation with a number of partner nations to constantly enhance their capabilities.http://police.ge/en/ministry/structure-and- offices/counterterrorist-center Material and equipment as well as infrastructural needs have been steadily upgraded over the years.http://ssg.gov.ge/en/page/counter-terrorismhttp://police.ge/en/shinagan- saqmeta-ministrma-spetsialuri-operatsiebis-tsentris-bazaze-ganakhlebuli- satskhovrebeli-korpusebi-gakhsna/5693#!prettyPhoto The unit is also the first to engage in high risk domestic or international operations, former starting in the mid-to late 1990s and latter from 2001 on losing an undisclosed number of servicemen. Georgia is an active member and advisor of the global anti- terrorist coalition and constantly participates in multinational operations.http://ssg.gov.ge/en/page/info/international-cooperation =Prevention and proliferation of CBRN threats= Georgia is the regional center for biological-and virological research and also hosts a number of soviet military- and research facilities as well as storage areas that contain radioactive and chemical substances.http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/georgia/http://ncdc.ge/en- US/LaboratoryNetworksAndBS Those facilities are subjected to a permanent state of control and monitoring by the SSSG. However, on the occupied territories international security measures have not been implemented thus maintaining transit routes and much greater vulnerability to smuggling of CBRN material through the country than already present.http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav030107a.shtmlhttp://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/georgia- draws-attention-nuclear-smuggling-abkhazia-and-south- osetia/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=451&nid;=36522&NewsCatID;=324&p;=7 Such weaknesses have been exploited on multiple occasions throughout the years. Many attempts were made to smuggle depleted and enriched uranium in or out of the country, however most of those have been prevented by investigative and operative events. In the more recent period alone over 19 individuals have been detained on charges of illicit trafficking of nuclear material in four incidents. Georgia works closely with the US, UN, partner nations and the CBRN CoE and was the first nation to elaborate and adopt the Strategy and Action Plan of the EU thus becoming one of the primary members of the 28 nations initiative. One of the SSSGs priorities is to also become member of the G7 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction.http://ssg.gov.ge/en/page/cbrn- defensehttp://www.spacewar.com/reports/Georgia_US_ink_deal_to_fight_nuclear_smuggling_999.html International Cooperation Structure The SSSG consists of following structural entities: *Administration *Counterterrorism Center *Anti-Corruption Agency *Counterintelligence Division *State Security Division *Information- Analytical Division *Operative-Technical Division *Division for Operative Measures *Economic Division *Special Operations Department *Facilities Protection Division *Main Division Human Resources. *General Inspection References Category:Intelligence agencies Category:Counter-terrorist organizations Category:Government of Georgia (country) ","title":"State Security Service of Georgia"},{"id":"51975628","text":"Victorie Guilman (born 25 March 1996) is a French professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's WorldTeam .

History  Ground was broken for the construction of Elkins Hall in 1947, and was first used during the 1948‚Äì1949 school year. Originally, it was called simply the Main Building, and housed the college's administrative offices, classrooms, laboratories, cafeteria, bookstore, and library.La Pirogue Yearbook, 1957. As more buildings were added to the campus, the building was used more exclusively for administrative offices. The building was named for Dr. Charles Calvert Elkins (1900‚Äì1963), founding dean of Francis T. Nicholls Junior College. In 1956, the school was separated from Louisiana State University and designated it a four-year institution, renamed Nicholls State College. Elkins served as its first President from 1956 until his retirement in 1963. Following his death later that year, the building was renamed Charles Calvert Elkins Hall in his honor in 1964.Program, Architecture--Nicholls State University--Elkins Hall Vertical file, Nicholls Archives.Architecture--Nicholls State University--Buildings Vertical file, Nicholls Archives.

The spur castle may be visited for an entrance fee.  Location  The hill castle is located within the Franconian Switzerland- Veldenstein Forest Nature Park on a rocky hill spur at a height of about 420 metres over the valley of the Ailsbach in Franconian Switzerland, 6.5 kilometres northwest of Pottenstein. Within walking distance of the castle is Sophie's Cave, a dripstone cave that is popular with tourists. In the vicinity of Rabenstein Castle there used to be several other castles: on the opposite side of the valley is the suspected site or burgstall of Brunnloch or Rabenloch,The suspected burgstall on the pages of the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection a little further up the Ailsbach valley once stood the castle of Ahorn,Ahorn Castle site on the pages of the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection the present day hamlet of Klausstein, opposite it is probably the site of Hohenloch Castle above Ludwig's Cave,The fortification on the pages of the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection down the valley lies the Alte Veste and in the village of Oberailsfeld there was once another small fortification, Ailsfeld Castle on a rock in the valley. Towards the west, above the valley of the Wiesent, stands Rabeneck Castle, a fortification probably founded by the Rabensteins.  History of the castle  Siebmacher's armorial The oldest parts of the castle were built in the first quarter of the 12th century as a residence in the Barony of Waischenfeld. At the same time the ministerialis family of Rabenstein,See List of Franconian noble families#R who were the builders of the castle and bore the raven on their coat of arms, were recorded as being in the service of the barons of Waischenfeld.See List of Franconian noble families#W In the early 13th century, the outer ward was expanded. During the following centuries ownership and occupancy of the castle changed hands several times. Its occupants included the House of Schl√ºsselberg and its lords, the burgraves of Nuremberg. In 1450 the castle was destroyed in the First Margrave War and in 1489 was rebuilt by Conz of Wirsberg. In 1557 the castle went to the von Rabensteins who had ambitions for the nobility and bought back their family seat. Daniel of Rabenstein remodelled the castle in 1570, the old outer ward being merged with the inner ward. During the Thirty Years' War, the castle was again completely destroyed by imperial troops, because its lord, Hans Christoph of Rabenstein, aligned himself with the Swedes. After the war between 1648 and 1728 a few small buildings and a farm were re-established. In 1742 the von Rabensteins died out and the castle went to the counts of Sch√∂nborn- Wiesentheid, who revamped the ruins in 1829/30 for a royal visit by Ludwig I.

They can be found in the cemeteries of St. Laurentii church in S√ºderende St. Johannes church in Nieblum and St. Nikolai church in Boldixum which is now a district of Wyk auf F√∂hr. Similar objects are known from the neighbour island of Amrum. All such headstones made until 1870 are designated cultural heritage monuments. Their inscriptions tell the biographies of the deceased including their private and professional lives, extraordinary events, and honorary appointments. With 265 monuments, the St. Johannis cemetery has the largest inventory of historical gravestones in Nordfriesland district. The best-known tombstone is the one of Matthias Petersen who was a very successful whaling captain and was therefore dubbed \\"Lucky Matthew\\" (der gl√ºckliche Matthias). The only ornamental decoration on this stone is a circular relief depicting the goddess of fortune upon a swimming whale in the style of a coat of arms. It features the only inscription completely in Latin language in the cemetery of S√ºderende, which relates that Petersen who died in 1706 caught 373 whales during his lifetime. Origin of the material The oldest Talking Gravestones were made from slabs of red sandstone that originates from the Solling hills in northern Westphalia. Later tombstones measure roughly . Most gravestones were made from sandstone quarried in Obernkirchen, Lower Saxony. Shipmasters used to take the stones on board as ballast. Only wealthy people from F√∂hr could afford totally new monuments while poor persons would have to grind off old slabs to add a new design. Sometimes also test objects from a stonemason's workshop may have been erected in the cemetery. This theory is supported by specific letters and the word ALVABET on the backside of one headstone. Stonemasons Apart from a few great tomb plates that were likely created by foreign, professional stonemasons, all Talking Gravestones were made locally by the island population. At first it may have been Dutch wood carvers from the mainland that were hired to decorate the gravestones, until ship carpenters had obtained the skills of stonemasonry and got orders from the neighbouring islands and F√∂hr proper to create gravestones. The design of the decorations is sometimes very intricate, so that the process of creation took a long time. As a result, many gravestones could only be erected several years after the burial of the deceased person. Language and symbolism The tombstone of a husband and wife in the cemetery of S√ºderende The cemetery of Nieblum The cemetery of Boldixum The texts on most gravestones are exclusively written in the \\"noble\\" church language of Standard German (Hochdeutsch) although the island then used to belong to Denmark and the everyday-language was Fering, a local dialect of the North Frisian language which is still spoken today. A few stones exhibit texts in Low German which used to be the official and ecclesiastical language until around 1700, while other texts are written in Latin. Some 20th-century tombstones have inscriptions in Fering. In order to tell the long biographies on the limited space of the stone slab, the stonemasons sometimes used abbreviations: *J.S.G.G.S. = Ihren Seelen Gott gn√§dig sei [May God have mercy upon their souls] *D.S.G.G.S. = Deren Seelen Gott gn√§dig sei [On whose souls God may have mercy] *I.S.S.G.G. = Ihrer Seele sei Gott gn√§dig [On whose soul God may have mercy] *D.S.G.G.I. = Deren Seelen Gott gn√§dig ist [On whose souls God has mercy] *G.S.S.S.G. = Gott sei seiner Seele gn√§dig [May God have mercy upon his soul]. The relief decorations are kept in baroque and rococo style. They are often detailed and fantastic with unique forms that are not repeated. The images may show \\"angels as symbols of justice, happiness, and a sign of faith, love and hope, but also ships, windmills and the family tree are shown\\". Scenes from the Bible are often the main motive of the ornaments on a stone. When a seafarer died on his ship, the ship is depicted with full sails while unrigged ships mean that the sailor died on land. Other popular motives are items from the deceased person's daily trade but also Lady Justice. A special iconographic tradition can be found in the floral motives: the husband and the sons of a family are depicted on the left-hand side of the image as tulip-like flowers whereas the wife and daughters are shown on the right-hand side as star-shaped flowers with four petals. A broken stalk is a sign that the respective person was already dead when the tombstone was created. The frequency of broken flowers attests a high rate of infant mortality. History The oldest gravestones were made of sandstone slabs. To put them up in a slanted position, a hole was drilled through the stone so a wooden staff or a whale bone could support the stone. In later times, largers stones became popular that were called 'Bremen stones' according to their origin. The oldest Talking Gravestone dates back to the year 1605. After 1700, the income of the population increased rapidly. because from the 17th to the 19th century, seafarers from F√∂hr including a number of captains pursued whaling and merchant shipping. In these times, upright tombstones were used more often. Steles were introduced in the 18th century. When they were erected, they were mostly decorated with a coloured ornament on top, the section below would relate the biography of the deceased, and at the bottom would often be a Biblical verse or another image. When old stones were grinded off, the original top decoration often remained intact. The early 19th century marked the decline of this type of gravestones. Classicist monuments became increasingly popular which refrained from displaying images and extended biographies. In the mid-19th century, this special form of burial culture had become totally uncommon. Nowadays, polished slabs of granite that only display the name and vital statistics of the deceased are usually found on F√∂hr and other North Frisian islands.

The technology \\"jams\\" the signal so that the tags cannot be read from a certain distance. However, this technology still has limitations because it can block only the responses but not kill the queries of the tags. However, they have no intentions of mass-producing the technology. Although there was concern about publishing the different ways that RFID tags could be exploited online, it causes the threats to this technology to no longer be theoretical.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, creamy white flowers and cup-shaped, cylindrical or barrel-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia torta is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, sometimes powdery white, cream-coloured or pale grey bark that is shed from the tree in thin scales. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance- shaped, wavy and twisted, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, long and wide, tapering to a flattened or channelled petiole long. The flowers are borne on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear- shaped to spherical, long and wide with a rounded to flattened operculum. Flowering has been observed in November and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, cylindrical or barrel-shaped fruit long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Corymbia torta was first formally described in 1995 by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson in the journal Telopea from specimens collected in 1999 by Hill and Leonie Stanberg, near Mount Jameson on the upper Drysdale River. The specific epithet (torta) is from the Latin tortus meaning \\"twisted\\", referring to the adult leaves. In the same journal paper, Hill and Johnson described three subspecies and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Corymbia torta subsp. allanii K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson; * Corymbia torat subsp. mixtifolia K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson; * Corymbia torta K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson subsp. torta.

Biography  His father, Johann Hilarius Krevel (1776-1846) was an art dealer and portrait painter of some note who experimented with new methods of producing lithographs. After taking his first art lessons from his father, he studied with , a portrait and landscape painter who had a private school in Kassel and was himself a student of Jacques-Louis David. Through Krauskopf's contacts, in 1824, Krevel was able to go study in Paris. While there, he may have worked with Antoine-Jean Gros and was influenced by the works of Ingres. The Kraemer Family (with their ironworks at Sankt Ingbert in the background) In 1827, one of his portraits was accepted for the Salon. The followed year, he opened his own studio and his name appeared in the Almanach des 25.000 adresses des principaux habitants de Paris. As a result, he received a commission from the town of S√®te to make a copy of a painting by Fran√ßois G√©rard, depicting the coronation of Charles X. His portraits did not provide sufficient income, however, so he also worked as a decorative painter. In 1830, he decided to return to Germany and appears to have worked in Nordrhein-Westfalen. By 1836, he was working in the Saar region and, four years later, was exhibiting at the Prussian Academy of Arts. His works were praised by Christian Daniel Rauch, who tried to persuade him to move to Berlin. Krevel apparently preferred the lack of competition where he was. Based on the locations of his showings, he spent most of his time in Baden-Baden but travelled frequently as his commissions dictated. Most of his clients were from the newly thriving bourgeoisie created by the industrialization of the Saar. Some of the most notable were Adolf Kraemer (1798-1876) and his family (iron); the and their heirs (coal) and (coal and iron). Sometime in the mid-1840s, he settled in Cologne and became a member of the K√∂lnischer Kunstverein. Through his friendship with Jakob G√∂tzenberger, he also maintained contact with the kunstverein in Mannheim. In 1856, he participated in another exhibit at the Prussian Academy. In 1865, discouraged by the growing popularity of portrait photography, he retired from painting, became withdrawn and moved to a small house in Freiburg im Breisgau. He suffered a stroke in 1873 and moved to Trier to live with his sister, Jenny, who was newly widowed. His health continued to deteriorate and he died there three years later.

History Asgard Miniatures was founded by Bryan Ansell, Steven Fitzwater and Paul Sulley in 1976 in Nottingham. Ansell was an experienced sculptor, having previously worked at Conquest Miniatures. Originally the company was managed by Sulley, while Ansell and Nick Bibby created the sculpts, Garry Parsons created the moulds, and Jamie Sims cast the miniatures. Asgard was a stepping stone for some noted sculptors, who started their careers with Asgard before moving to other companies; chief among these was lead designer and co-founder Bryan Ansell, who left Asgard in 1978 to form successful rival Citadel Miniatures with funding from Games Workshop. Others included Jes Goodwin, Nick Bibby, Tony Ackland and Rick Priestley. By 1984, Asgard was struggling, but turned down an offer to merge with Citadel Miniatures. To modernize the packaging of their products from plastic bags stapled to cardboard cards that had been standard in the 1970s to the more up-to-date blister packages, Asgard merged with distributor Sanders International. This was not enough to sustain the company, and when Asgard went out of business, their US rights were acquired by The Viking Forge, which still produces their fantasy miniatures. The UK rights were acquired first by Tabletop Games, and then Alternative Armies, which still produces several Asgard lines, including the Space Marines (SM line) and the Barbarian Personalities (BP line). Reception In the September 1977 edition of White Dwarf (Issue 2), Ian Livingstone reviewed 15 Asgard figures, and stated that \\"Asgard use good quality alloy for the figures which do not bend [...] They are well-cast figures, requiring virtually no preparatory work before painting and it is good to see different-sized, rounded bases getting away from the traditional rectangular base.\\" In the August-September 1979 edition of White Dwarf (Issue 14), and again in the August-September edition (Issue 20), Asgard Miniatures were featured in the photographic feature titled \\"Molten Magic\\". In the May 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 73), Kim Eastland called Asgard's Large Sadistic Demon line \\"Possibly the most creative line of monsters to come along in quite a while.\\" Eastland complimented the \\"well- sculpted scaly hides\\", and concluded that these were \\"ideal for the gamer who wants to spring a little surprise on his fellow players.\\".\\" In the July 1983 edition Dragon (Issue 75), Kim Eastland was impressed by Asgard's science fiction line, saying, \\"The present low supply of good SF figures is boosted by this gorgeous collection of space marines.\\" He concluded \\"If you have a need for science-fiction warriors in futuristic armor, then Asgard is the place to 'hire' them from.\\" References Category:Gaming miniatures companies ","title":"Asgard Miniatures"},{"id":"51976801","text":"Richland Creek is a stream in Iron County in the U.S. state of Missouri.

Pettiford (January 20, 1847 ‚Äì September 20, 1914) was a minister and banker in Birmingham, Alabama. Early in his career he worked as a minister and teacher in various towns in Alabama, moving to the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1883 and serving there for about ten years. In 1890 he founded the Alabama Penny Savings Bank, which played an important role in black economic development in Alabama and in the South during the 25 years it existed. Pettiford has been called the most significant institutional builder and leader in the African American community in Birmingham during the period in which he lived. In 1897 he was said to be next to Booker T. Washington the black man who has done the most in the South for blacks. Early life William Reuben Pettiford was born in Granville County, North Carolina on January 20, 1847 to William and Matilda Pettiford. His parents were free blacks and owned a farm. William worked on the farm and had lessons on the weekends where he learned to read. About the age of ten, his parents sold their farm and moved to Person County, North Carolina, where Pettiford was able to get a tutor and more formal lessons. On July 4, 1868, Pettiford converted to the Baptist religion and on August 3, 1868 he was baptized by Rev. Ezekiel Horton in Salisbury, North Carolina. He took the place of clerk at the Pleasant Grove church and on July 4, 1869 he married Mary Jane Farley, daughter of Joseph Farley, but she died on March 8, 1870. He remarried to Jennie Powell on July 24, 1873, but she died September 5, 1874. He married a third time on November 23, 1880 to Della Boyd, daughter of Richard and Caroline Boyd of Selma, Alabama. They had at least three children, the oldest of which was Carry Bell Pettiford born September 22, 1882. Early career as minister and teacher On December 3, 1869 he moved to Selma, Alabama where he took work as a farm hand and teacher. He entered the State Normal School at Marion, Alabama where he studied for seven years, teaching and farming in his spare time to fund his education. He took a principalship at a school in Uniontown, Alabama from which he resigned in 1877 to focus on finishing his schooling. In 1878, he was elected a teacher at the Selma Institute (later Selma University) and given the opportunity to study theology under then president, W. H. Woodsmall. On March 6, 1879 he was licensed to preach at the Baptist Church in Marion, Alabama and in November 1879 he was made general financial agent by the board at the State Baptist Convention in Opelika, Alabama. In 1880, he resigned from these positions to accept the pastorate of a church at Union Springs, Alabama. In late February 1883 he moved to Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. In Birmingham, he was a very successful fundraiser for the church, and succeeded in building a new church building costing $25,000 and growing the size of the congregation. Community leader In 1887, together with A. L. Scott, Samuel Roebuck, George Turner, J. H. Thompson, Sandy Goodloe, D. A. Williams, A. T. Walker, R. C. O. Benjamin, and J. T. Jones he incorporated the Robert Brown Elliot School of Technology in Birmingham, the first school of its kind for blacks in the US By 1887, he was a leader in the Baptist Church in Alabama: he was president of the Ministerial Association in Birmingham, a member of the board of trustees at Selma University, and president of the Negro American Publishing Company affiliated with the Birmingham Negro American Journal. In 1889, he was in a delegation to meet with President Benjamin Harrison to discuss needs of Republicans in Alabama and advocate for greater inclusion of blacks in Republican politics. He was a attendee of the 1889 American National Baptist Convention in Indianapolis where William J. Simmons led the push to provide aid for blacks fleeing violence in the South and moving to the North. In 1896 he was an Alabama at-large delegate to the 1896 Republican National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri and supported William McKinley. W R Pettiford in 1902 In 1895 he wrote Divinity in Wedlock about Christian marriage. In 1899 he was a predominant delegate at the annual meeting of the National Afro-American Council in Chicago led by Alexander Walters. In the late 1890s, Pettiford and other pastors petitioned the city to form the first public high school for African Americans in Birmingham called Industrial High School. The school opened in September 1900 with Arthur H. Parker principal in the Cameron Building and held its first graduation at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in 1904. In September 1902, he led the local organization for relief of the victims of the Shiloh Baptist Church stampede that killed over 100 people during a speech given by Booker T. Washington He was again an Alabama delegate-at-large to the 1908 Republican National Convention in Chicago. He received an honorary master of arts from Shaw University in June, 1912. He was the spiritual leader of the Alabama Grand Lodge of the Knights of Pythias. In 1904, together with Rev. C. O. Boothe, Pettiford held theological classes in the basement of the church to educate future ministers. These classes became what is today known as the Birmingham-Easonian Baptist Bible College. At the Sixteenth Street church, Pettiford established the Christian Aid Society to help sick members and bury its dead. He was a member of the Birmingham Negro Business League and the city's Inter-Denominational Ministers' Alliance. He was constantly active in Birmingham and Alabama politics and he worked particularly closely with Reverend T. W. Walker of the cities Shiloh Baptist Church on a number of civil rights and anti-Jim Crow causes. Alabama Penny Savings Bank Pettiford was inspired by the apparent need and by the success of William Washington Browne's Saving Bank of the Grand Fountain United Order of True Reformers of Richmond, Virginia to establish a local bank for the community. The Alabama Penny Savings Company opened on October 15, 1890 due to the efforts of Pettiford, Peter F. Clarke (who became the bank's vice- president), B. H. Hudson Sr. (who worked as a cashier), N. B. Smith, Arthur H. Parker, and Thomas W. Walker. The board of directors included Reverend J. I. Jackson, F. S. Hayzel, and Reverend J. Q. A. Wilhite. Pettiford was the leader of the efforts to establish the bank but wished to continue his position in the church and not be bank president. However, the directors told him that it was necessary for the community's confidence in the bank that he be its president and he reluctantly took the role on a year to year basis. Four years after the bank was formed he finally resigned as pastor and turned to bank president full time, although he continued to insist that he was still a preacher and he continued to preach. He even held the pastorate at Tabernacle Baptist Church for a short period during his presidency. Pettiford's leadership took influence from his friend, Booker T. Washington, emphasizing self-help and racial solidarity while cultivating the assistance of white leaders who helped train employees and finance the bank. One example was the aid the Steiner Brothers gave which helped the bank persist through the economic panic of 1893. He also believed in the relationship between financial and spiritual success, and in 1895 wrote a book entitled God's Revenue System about this idea. In 1906, Pettiford organized the National Negro Banking Association at the convention of the National Negro Business League, where he was a prominent member. In 1910, Percy Bond organized another bank to service the African-American community in Birmingham, and the two clashed at the 1910 League convention in New York City. The bank continued its success and by 1913, the bank's assets were over $540,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) and it had branches across the state. Pettiford's leadership was key to the bank's success, and the bank failed shortly after his death. Death Pettiford took ill in March 1914 and took an indefinite leave from the head of the bank and was succeeded by J. O. Diffay. Pettiford died of heart failure on Sunday, September 20, 1914 in Birmingham, Alabama. His funeral was at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church led by Rev. F. G. Ragland and Rev. D. P. Moore.

The term is generally used in the context of attacks which search memory much more efficiently than simply testing each sequence of bytes to determine if it provides the correct answer. They are often used in combination with cold boot attacks to extract key material from computers.  Approaches  In their seminal paper on Key Finding attacks, Shamir and van Someren proposed two different approaches to key finding: statistical or entropic key finding and analytical key finding. The former relies on detecting differences in the statistical properties of the data that make up cryptographic keys while the later relies on determining specific byte patterns that must necessarily exist in the target key material and looking for these patterns. = Statistical key finding = In general for most cryptographic systems the cryptographic keys should be as random as possible. For most symmetric ciphers the keys can and should be a truly random set of bits. For most asymmetric ciphers the private keys are either numbers chosen at random with certain constraints (such as primality or being generators in a group) or are the result of computations based on a set of random numbers with some constraints. In either case the key material exhibits high entropy. In contrast to this, most uncompressed data in a computer's memory has relatively low entropy. As a result, if a key is known to exist in memory in its raw form then it is likely to stand out against the background of non-key data by virtue of its high entropy and an attacker needs to only test for matching keys in areas of memory or storage that have high entropy. High entropy keys stand out visually against background low-entropy data. The contrast between the low entropy of most data and the high entropy of key data is sufficient as to be apparent by visual inspection. The image to the right shows an example of this. = Analytical key finding = While statistical key finding can be effective for reducing the amount of memory that needs to be searched, it still requires high-entropy areas to be tested to check if they contain the correct key material. In certain cases, particularly in the context of public key encryption systems, it is possible to determine patterns that must occur in the key material and then limit the search to areas where these patterns are found. Shamir and van Someren demonstrated one example of this analytical approach for finding private RSA keys where the public key is known and has a small public exponent. In the RSA system the public key is a pair (n,e), where n=p.q with p and q being two large primes. The corresponding private key is (n,d) (or sometimes (p,q,d) or some variant thereof) where e.d\\\\equiv1\\\\pmod{\\\\phi(n)}, which is to say that e multiplied by d is equivalent to 1, modulo \\\\phi(n) where œÜ represents Euler's totient function and is the size of the multiplicative group modulo n. In the case of an RSA key \\\\phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)=n-p-q+1. Finding the value of \\\\phi(n) from n allows for the factorization of n and the security of the RSA cryptosystem rests on the difficulty of doing so. As such an attacker can not determine d exactly given e and n. An attack can however know a fair amount about what d looks like, given the knowledge that p and q are typically chosen to be the same length in bits and are both 'close' to the square root of n. Thus an attacker can approximate a guess of \\\\phi(n)\\\\approx \\\\phi '(n) = n-2\\\\sqrt{n} and typically this approximation will be correct in the more significant half of its bits of its binary representation. The relationship of e and d means that d = (1 + k.\\\\phi(n))/e, where the exact value of k is unknown but 0 < k < e. Using this fact and the approximation \\\\phi'(n) , the attacker can enumerate a set of possible values for the top half of the binary representation of d for each possible value of k. These binary patterns can be tested for many orders of magnitude faster than performing a trail decryption. Furthermore, in the common case of e=3 it can be shown that k=2, which allows the top half of the bits of d to be determined exactly and searched for directly.  Application  Key finding attacks have been used in conjunction with cold boot attacks to extract keys from machines after they have been switched off. Heninger and Shacham showed that keys can be extracted even when the data in memory has been corrupted by having the power removed. Statistical key finding was used by Nicko van Someren to locate the signature verification keys used by Microsoft to validate the signatures on MS-CAPI plug-ins. One of these key was later discovered to be referred to as the NSAKEY by Microsoft, sparking some controversy.  Mitigations  Key finding attacks can be mitigated in several ways.

It is a part of the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. The peak has a multitude of hiking, running, and Nordic skiing trails, and has many sites dedicated to the national park. Standing in the middle of Woodstock, Vermont, the peak also is host to many annual town events, including the Road to the Pogue Race. Visible from the top are sights such as the village of Woodstock, the sister peak of Mount Tom (Mount Peg), the Ottauquechee River, Vermont Route 4A, and many neighboring mountains.  Location  thumb Mount Tom is located In the northeast of Woodstock, Vermont. It is near the bordering town of Pomfret, Vermont, and is flanked by Vermont Route 12 and Prosper Road. VT Route 4A, the largest east-west route in the state, is 1.3 miles south west of the main entrance to the mountain, the Faulkner Trail.  Trails  Mount Tom has four main entrances to trails intertwining along the whole mountain. The Faulkner Trail entrance is off Mountain Road and the local Faulkner Park. This trail is a direct route from the base of Mount Tom to the summit. Another entrance lies off Prosper Road. This trail leads directly to the Pogue, a 14 acre manmade pond created by a dam. The main entrance to the mountain lies within the Marsh-Billings- Rockefeller National Historic Park. This entrance leads to a circuit of trails that go to the summit, the Pogue, and through the forest of the mountain. All of the trails are open year-round, but the most active months are May to October. The trails are popular sites for local day hikes in the summer months and Nordic skiing in the winter months. In the winter, trails are groomed and maintained to allow for locals and visitors to Nordic ski along the face of the mountain. Along many of the trails are remnants of historic farms from early Vermont farm owners, and sites that are kept and maintained by the National Park Service. = Faulkner Trail = The Faulkner Trail is a popular trail traveled on the mountain. It switchbacks up the southern facing side of the mountain all the way from the base to the peak. From the top is a panoramic view of the town of Woodstock, Vermont. The trail was built by Marianne Faulkner for her husband over 75 years ago. The purpose of the trail today is for scenic enjoyment, as well as connecting the Woodstock Trail System to the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park.https://www.nps.gov/mabi/planyourvisit/upload/Faulkner-Trail.pdf The trail was recently repaired by local forces and the National Park Service. In 2004, the Billings Park Commission began to restore this trail. Most of the work was implemented by the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps (VYCC) crews. Together with restoration specialists, a majority of the repair work went into stonework, cleaning out and restoring culverts, and repairing the trail tread in Faulkner Park. Starting at the Faulkner Park, the trail is 3.75 miles in length.  Wildlife  The face of the mountain has a very diverse wildlife. Because of the diversity in habitats, including wooded areas, open fields, and ponds, the wildlife ranges from amphibians to mammals to rare birds to reptiles alike. From aquatic to land animals, the flora and fauna are both diverse and are closely protected by the National Park Service. = Mammals = Mount Tom is home to many species typical to Vermont and New England. The most common mammals are eastern chipmunks, red and grey squirrels, woodchucks, and white tail deer. More nocturnal mammals are raccoons and skunks, while rarely seen are foxes, fisher cats, or black bears. = Birds = Many of the birds that live on Mount Tom are season songbirds common to Vermont. Both seasonal and year-round, it is mostly songbirds that live within the confines of the forest. An example of which is the Hermit thrush, state bird of Vermont. Very common on the mountain are various species of owl that hunt nocturnally. The species of owl are mainly the barred and barn owls. Near the Pogue, birds such as Great Blue herons feed. = Reptiles and Amphibians = Because Mount Tom has many different types of habitats, the aquatic environments, including both the Pogue and many streams, support the lives of reptiles and amphibians. Many common varieties of frogs, salamanders, and toads can be found in bodies of water and streams on the surface of Mount Tom. Also near the pond, reptiles such as snapping and painted turtles reside. Snakes are not common on the mountain, but common species such as garter, milk, and red belly can be spotted on the forest floor. = Plant Life = Mount Tom has on it many trees that are not native to the area. This is because Frederick H. Billings, the owner of the land before it was a park, took to planting various patches of trees from other parts of the world. These would include Norway spruce, red pine, European larch, and also trees that were more localized such as sugar maples, beeches, and birch trees. Some of these trees, being deciduous, are a pinnacle of Vermont for their bright foliage that peak every autumn. Trees such as pine, spruce, and larch, however, are evergreens, and keep their leaves year-round. The mountain is also full of various types of Fern, the most abundant types being Polystichum acrostichoides (Christmas fern) and the Athyrium (lady fern).  Local Events  Many local events take place on the mountain because of its central location and communal importance. Events include annual races, scientific explorations, and local events centered around celebrating community events and local food. = Road to the Pogue = The road to the Pogue is an annual 6.1 mile running race that takes place on the carriage trails of Mount Tom. The race is run every year by many members of the community of Woodstock. The course travels along the most scenic parts of the mountain and National Park with views to Mount Ascutney, a lap around the Pogue, and back down to the south peak of Mount Tom overlooking the village of Woodstock. = Bio Blitz = Bio Blitz is an annual event put on by the National Park Service for the members of the community. It is a day dedicated to explore the mountain and learning about the organisms that live there. It includes guided tours of the trails by park rangers for people to learn as much as they can. The purpose of the day is for member of the community to help identify species of plants and animals on Mount Tom and in the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historic Park. Contributions are added into the Vermont Atlas of Life. = Trek to Taste = Trek to Taste is an annual event in the town of Woodstock that celebrates local foods on the trails of Mount Tom and the National Park. Events that take place include guided walks around the trail system, farm fresh food samples along the trails, arts and crafts, trail games, quests and community health exhibits and Ice Cream Socials.

They are mentioned in old literature, such as the Tenp≈ç period book the and Ihara Saikaku's collection of miscellaneous tales the as well as Edo period kaidan books such as the Kokon Hyaku Monogatari Hy≈çban (Âè§‰ªäÁôæÁâ©Ë™ûË©ïÂà§'), the , and Toiryama Sekien's collection of y≈çkai depictions, the Gazu Hyakki Yagy≈ç, among other mentions. Concept According to the Shokoku Rijin Dan, on a rainy night, in Hiraoka, Kawachi (now Higashi≈çsaka, Osaka Prefecture), it would appear as a ball of fire with a length of one shaku (about 30 centimeters). It is said that in the past, an old woman stole oil from Hiraoka Shrine and became a mysterious fire from a resulting curse. Once, when someone was walking along the road at night in Kawachi, the ubagabi suddenly appeared from nowhere and hit this person's face, and when this person looked closely, it took on the form of a chicken-like bird. It is said that when the ubagabi eventually flew away, it turned back into its original appearance as a ball of fire. From this, the y≈çkai manga artist Mizuki Shigeru suggested the possibility that the ubagabi was actually a bird. In the tale where an old woman became an ubagabi, the Saikaku Shokoku Banashi, it's written about here as the \\"Mi wo Sute Abura-tsubo (the oil pot that threw away its body).\\" According to this, the ubagabi is said to fly a length of about one ri (about four kilometers) in a mere instant, and it's said when the ubagabi grazes around someone's shoulder, that person would die within three years. However, it's said that ubagabi would disappear if you say \\"abura- sashi\\" (meaning \\"oil pourer\\"). There is also a legend about an ubagabi appearing at the Hozu River in Kyoto Prefecture. In the Kokon Hyaku Monogatari Hy≈çban, there was once an old woman who lived near Kameyama (now Kameoka, Kyoto Prefecture) who would receive money from parents, telling them that she would take them to meet people they needed to see, and put the children into the Hozu River. Eventually, perhaps as divine punishment, the old woman experienced a flood and drowned. After that, it is said that a mysterious flame would appear near Hozu River, and people called this the ubagabi. It is also titled \\"Ubagabi\\" (here written as Âß•„ÅåÁÅ´) in the Gazu Hyakki Yagy≈ç, and it is depicted with an old woman's face within the mysterious flames, but since there is the statement \\"it's said to be in Kawachi Province\\" within accompanying description, this makes it a depiction of a Kawachi Province legend.

Sollers conceived the book as a literary homage to Dante's Paradiso. Noted by critics for its lack of punctuation, Paradis has been compared to The Cantos of Ezra Pound and Joyce's Finnegans Wake. Paradis was published in three volumes: Paradis, followed later by Paradis II and Paradis III. Overview Sollers described the origins of Paradis as being traceable to a \\"creative rage\\" that first resulted in his book Lois, which marked a departure from the \\"slightly obsessive ascetic\\" mode in which he wrote his books Drame and Nombres, books which he characterized as representing a \\"period of research into the disposition of writing methods.\\" Sollers said of the book's title, Paradis: > [It] implies a rewriting of Dante's Paradiso, but it's a paradise that has > changed a good deal since Dante's time. Perhaps the phrase which best gives > the sense of my title is a sentence from Sade, who says, \\"Everything is > paradise in this hell.\\" I am off to palm off as pleasurable, or at least > acceptable, all that would ordinarily be more disturbing, both spiritually > and physically. My approach has changed because I've focused attention more > radically and integrally on the Bible. Sollers commented that the book reflects his interest in the \\"unprecedented period of flux or mutation\\" of Western culture: > [M]y work on Paradis concentrates on that point. I'm not speaking only of > the New Testament. Obviously, I describe Christianity as an adventure at > once pathetic and comic. I was inspired by Joyce in this. Critical reception Poet and literary critic Hilary Anne Clark has commented on the formal difficulties that Paradis presents to readers: > Philippe Sollers' Paradis contains a ... major block to comprehension in > that it lacks any form of visual punctuation to guide the reader in making > sense, in reconstituting its units of meaning. Each page of Paradis is a > solid, unbroken mass of words, whose visual density is further emphasized by > the use of a very black, italicized typescript. Lacking the visual landmarks > provided by conventional punctuation practice, the reader can neither > encompass the entire work, nor often decide where one unit of sense takes up > from a preceding unit or gives way to a succeeding one. Clark goes on to cite Paradis as an example of an encyclopedic tendency in literature, comparing it to Joyce's Finnegans Wake and Pound's Cantos: > The dominance of the encyclopaedic gesture in Finnegans Wake, Paradis and > the Cantos allows us to account for the characteristic length, obscurity and > \\"bookishness\\" of these works; they absorb the traits and tensions of essay, > Menippean satire and epic while yet exceeding these traits in their > fictional translation of the encyclopaedic paradoxes noted above. This > translation manifests itself in each work as a characteristic parodic > hesitation before the authority of totalizing predecessors; it manifests > itself in the texts' fascination with images of a paradisiacal completion > and timelessness, a tendency that is undercut by a repetitive, digressive or > fragmented form which asserts the inevitability of time and incompletion. > Further, the Wake, Paradis and the Cantos, in their overt and extensive > intertextual activity , emphasize the textual boundaries of encyclopaedic > knowledge. Nonetheless, in their foregrounding and valorization of speech > rhythms, the works also repeat the challenge that the encyclopaedia brings > to its own limited nature as written book. Critics Philip Barnard and Cheryl Lester note that in Paradis, \\"Sollers achieved a tour de force of modernist poetics whose clear precedents are Joyce and Faulkner. The powerful narrative voice that emerges in these works foregrounds song, chant, psalmody, and real rhythms that point toward their sources in sacred texts and Dantean epos.\\" Roland Champagne, in his monograph on Philippe Sollers, writes that > The humor of Paradis is found in its game of messages embedded in apparently > unrelated sequences of spoken text. The messages are inserted by the > omniscient voice of the poet/writer for the reader to decipher. These are > encoded signals that the poet/writer offers as guides through the text. The > poet/writer is basically saying that he is the only one who can find the way > through this maze of contemporary culture's language. French literary critic Roland Barthes grouped Paradis with three other books by Sollers, Drame, H, and Lois, and described these four as books that > have to be referred to as novels because there is no other term to designate > them. But they do not tell stories, describe a particular society or present > identifiable characters. They are texts of which language itself is the > subject, language which is wholly free from the duty to describe. The world > which these texts presents is not one which the reader could either identify > as her own or see clearly as different from it. In the past, in Barthes' > view it was the author's duty to describe such a world which held language > unjustifiably captive. One of the reasons he writes with such enthusiasm > about Sollers is the way in which texts such as Paradis and Lois show what > happens when this duty is removed. Paradis in translation Paradis has not been translated into English in its entirety, although an English-language excerpt was published in an issue of TriQuarterly devoted to works that reflect the influence of Joyce's Finnegans Wake.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Parley Davis House stands in the village of East Montpelier Center, on the north side of Center Road. The main block is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior, to which an older Cape-style frame house is attached to the rear as an ell. The main block exhibits quality Federal woodwork, including an elaborate front entry with pilasters and sidelight windows beneath a half-round transom and gabled pediment. A Palladian window is above the entry. The interior of the main block retains original Federal period woodwork, while the rear ell reflects late 19th- century alterations. The oldest portion of the house is the rear ell. In 1791, Parley Davis built a log cabin. About 1795, he built a wood-frame cabin on this site, which was enlarged c. 1799 to the Cape frame seen as the ell today. About 1805, he built the Federal period main block of the house. Parley Davis was one of the first white settlers in the area, establishing mills that enabled further development of the area to take place. His home was also where early town meetings (of what was then Montpelier) took place until 1828, when they were moved to the nearby Methodist church. His house now stands as an important example of the evolution of architecture in early Vermont.

The ACSL also designed and developed carbon fiber products for other organizations in other industries. The hallmark technology pioneered by the Lamborghini Lab is the Forged Composite technology. For Lamborghini, the ACSL was responsible for carbon fiber technology innovation, such as experimenting with new materials and processes, as well as structural concept development and generating new body-in-white concepts. For other organizations, the ACSL provided design, engineering, testing, and educational services for carbon fiber composite products. The facility, located in the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle, also had a museum on carbon fiber materials and manufacturing that was open from 2015 to 2018.  History  = 2007 to 2013 = The ACSL began as an academic research laboratory under the guidance of Professor Paolo Feraboli at the University of Washington in Seattle. The lab was initially co-sponsored by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, and focused on conducting research in areas that were pertinent to the certification of the carbon fiber composite-intensive Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. These topics included certification methodologies for chopped carbon fiber technology, lightning strike damage, and crashworthiness of composite structures. In 2007, Lamborghini began co-sponsoring the ACSL with the purpose of creating a research collaboration between the aerospace and automotive industries in the field of advanced carbon fiber composite structures. The official inauguration of the ACSL took place on October 6th, 2009 with Lamborghini President Stephan Winkelmann and Chief Technical Officer Maurizio Reggiani, Boeing CEO Scott Carson, and UW President Mark Emmert. Following the establishment of the ACSL, Lamborghini opened the Advanced Composites Research Center (ACRC) at its headquarters in Italy in July 2010. The collaboration between Boeing and Lamborghini through the ACSL led to the incorporation of the aerospace engineering development mentality at Lamborghini known as the Building Block Approach. This approach calls for progressive correlation between analysis and experimental test data at different levels of structural complexity, from material coupons, to structural components and assemblies, to the full scale structure. The Building Block Approach was first used by Lamborghini ACSL and ACRC on the Aventador program for the development of the first out-of- autoclave carbon fiber monocoque. In particular, the Building Block Approach enabled the Aventador to pass its crash test certification on its first try. The ACSL and ACRC were responsible for the development, characterization, and testing of liquid resin infusion technologies (such as VaRTM and RTM) for the Aventador monocoque. Another area of collaboration between Boeing and Lamborghini researched at the ACSL focused on composite repair technologies. For the 787 aircraft, Boeing utilizes specialized technicians and engineers, called Aircraft on Ground crews, to fly out to a damaged aircraft and perform structural repairs on the composite airframe. The ACSL adopted, modified, and transferred these technologies, processes, and equipment to Lamborghini for use on the Aventador supercar. Lamborghini trained a similar team of specialized technicians, called the Flying Doctors, and became the first automaker to be certified for structural repair of composites by the German T√úV and insurance companies worldwide. The collaboration between Boeing and Lamborghini was celebrated in 2012 by painting an Aventador in a special Boeing livery for the Washington State showcase at the 2012 Aerospace & Defense Supplier Summit in Seattle. The ACSL also performed research in the area of 3D printing, in particular 3D printed high temperature prototype mold manufacturing, and 3D printed class A surface finish models. While at the University of Washington, the ACSL sponsored and graduated three Ph.D. students (Dr. Federico Gasco, Dr. Hirohide Kawakami, and Dr. Bonnie Wade) as well as 30 Master's and undergraduate students. = 2014 to 2018 = The ACSL exited the University of Washington on January 1, 2014 with Dr. Paolo Feraboli in order to transition from research into application and product development. It was a stand-alone organization located in an independent facility in the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle. The inauguration of the Interbay ACSL facility occurred on June 20, 2016 with Lamborghini President Stefano Domenicali and Chief Technical Officer Maurizio Reggiani. In addition to the research laboratory, the ACSL facility also included the Lamborghini Academy of Carbon Arts & Sciences, which offered professional classes on topics such as Forged Composite technology; and the Carbon Fiber Technology Gallery, which showcased over 30 years of carbon fiber composite innovation at Lamborghini. The ACSL actively engaged in outreach efforts such as student visits and internships with the Washington State Department of Commerce, the Washington Industrial Council, and local schools. The impact of the technologies developed by the Lambo Lab on the Lamborghini current vehicle lineup is still recognized today.  Forged Composite Technology  The ACSL is responsible for the pioneering work of Forged Composite technology, based on previous research of chopped carbon fiber material forms sponsored by Boeing and the FAA between 2006 and 2012. Starting from 2009, The ACSL began to transfer the knowledge developed in the lab to the prototyping division at Callaway Golf and Automobili Lamborghini, which jointly launched the Forged Composite technology at the 2010 Paris Auto Show. The ACSL designed and produced the first scale prototype of the Sesto Elemento monocoque, which was subsequently transformed into a full scale working monocoque by Lamborghini. Forged Composite has since become a key technology for Lamborghini, and has been used in the structure of the Huracan, as well as for the interior trim and seats of the Aventador J, Urus concept, Veneno, Asterion, and Huracan vehicles. The Forged Composite interior package won the JEC Composites Innovation Award for Automotive Interiors in 2016. Using Forged Composite technology, the ACSL has developed for Lamborghini the world's first carbon fiber wishbone suspension arms shown in 2010, and the first carbon fiber connecting rods shown in 2016. The ACSL has continued to introduce Forged Composite technology in other applications, such as the Union Binding Company FC snowboard binding, which won the ISPO Product of the Year Award in 2014.

Demaray has created listening stations for birds that play human music, fabricated alternative forms of housing for hermit crabs from artificial materials, and built light-sensing robotic supports that allow potted plants to roam freely in search of sunlight and water. Demaray is an associate professor of Fine Arts and head of the sculpture concentration at Rutgers University, Camden. She lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.  Education  Demaray received a BA in cognitive psychology at the University of California at Berkeley and a MFA in Art Practice at the University of California at Berkeley. She also studied art at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture.  Career  = Work = In a 2012 essay, Richard Klein, exhibitions director at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, described Demaray's work: In 2005, Demaray, who upholstered stones and knitted sweaters for plants as part of a campaign that she described as \\"inappropriate care- giving activities,\\" sewed a 27-foot long upholstered cozy for a dormant 10-ton Nike-Hercules Missile in Sausalito, CA. Her Sticks and Stones: The Nike Missile Cozy Project was designed to show the nature of warfare and to familiarize the public with what served as the U.S. land to air defense during the Cold War. In 2006, Demaray designed and produced tiny man-made houses for hermit crabs to address a housing shortage that may have resulted from the over-collecting of seashells by humans. Demaray worked with a paleontologist and a mechanical engineer to design the structures for The Hand Up Project, Attempting to Meet the New Needs of Natural Life Forms. In 2007, Demaray worked with video artist John Walsh to create Inside/Outside: Habitat, on view at the Abington Art Center's Sculpture Park in Jenkintown, PA. The project was designed to explore the musical tastes of local birds, which were offered a selection classical, rock, country and jazz music when they visited 10-foot perches. Demaray said her purpose was to encourage people to think about the impact that humans have on other species. In 2010, Demaray worked with an ant researcher at the American Museum of Natural History to create Corpor Esurit, or we all deserve a break today. The artwork offered a colony of ants food from McDonald's to present a commentary on the effects of the American diet on the creatures that depend on humans for food. In 2011, Demaray collaborated with lichen researcher Natalie Howe to grow lichen on several buildings in New York City. The objective of her project, Lichen for Skyscrapers, was to connect New Yorkers with the natural world in an immediate way. In 2013, Demaray collaborated with engineer Dr. Qingze Zou to create the IndaPlant Project: An Act of Trans-Species Giving. They built autonomously guided light- sensing robotic platforms for houseplants called \\"floraborgs,\\" which allow potted plants to roam freely in a domestic environment in search of water and sunlight, and alert other floraborgs to their locations.

The accusations have resulted in three much reported instances of litigation: his then-wife Ivana made a rape claim during their 1989 divorce litigation but later recanted that claim; businesswoman Jill Harth sued Trump in 1997 alleging breach of contract while also suing for sexual harassment but agreed to forfeit her sexual harassment claim as part of a settlement she received relating to the former suit; and, in 2017, former The Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos filed a defamation lawsuit after Trump accused her of lying about her sexual misconduct allegations against him. Two of the allegations (by Ivana Trump and Jill Harth) became public before Trump's candidacy for president, but the rest arose after a 2005 audio recording was leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself \\"can do anything\\" to women, including \\"just start kissing them... I don't even wait\\" and \\"grab 'em by the pussy\\". Trump subsequently characterized those comments as \\"locker room talk\\" and denied actually behaving that way toward women, and he also apologized for the crude language. Many of his accusers stated that Trump's denials provoked them into going public with their allegations. Another type of accusation was made, primarily after the audio recording surfaced, by several former Miss USA and Miss Teen USA contestants, who accused Trump of entering the dressing rooms of beauty pageant contestants. Trump, who owned the Miss Universe franchise, which includes both pageants, was accused of going into dressing rooms in 1997, 2000, 2001, and 2006, while contestants were in various stages of undress. Trump had already referred to this practice during a 2005 interview on The Howard Stern Show, saying he could \\"get away with things like that\\" because he owned the beauty pageants the women and girls were competing in. Trump has denied all the allegations against him, saying he has been the victim of media bias, conspiracies, and a political smear campaign. In October 2016, Trump publicly vowed to sue all the women who have made allegations of sexual misconduct against him, as well as The New York Times for publishing the allegations, but he has yet to follow through with any legal action. In June 2019, writer E. Jean Carroll alleged in New York magazine that Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in 1995 or 1996. Two friends of Carroll confirmed to the magazine that Carroll had previously confided in them in regard to the incident. Trump denied ever meeting Carroll, although New York had published a photo of Trump and Carroll together in 1987. In October 2019, the book All the President's Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator, by Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy was published, containing 43 additional allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump.

Ivana stated in a deposition taken in 1989, during their divorce proceedings, that Donald had visited her plastic surgeon following which he had expressed anger and ripped out hair from her scalp. Donald said the allegation was \\"obviously false\\". The book Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald Trump (1993), by Harry Hurt III, described the alleged attack as a \\"violent assault\\" during which Donald attacked Ivana sexually. According to the book, Ivana later confided to some of her friends that Donald had raped her. In a statement given just before the publication of Hurt's book, and included in the book, Ivana said: The Trumps' divorce was granted in December 1990 on grounds that Donald's treatment of Ivana, including his affair with Marla Maples, was \\"cruel and inhuman\\". According to Trump's lawyer, Jay Goldberg, this was based on Trump having been seen in public with Marla Maples in 1990. Their settlement had a confidentiality clause preventing Ivana discussing the marriage or the divorce. In 1992, Trump sued Ivana for not honoring a gag clause in their divorce agreement by disclosing facts about him in her best-selling book, and Trump won a gag order. Years later, Ivana said she and Donald \\"are the best of friends\\". In a July 2015 campaign endorsement, Ivana said: \\"I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit.\\" =Jill Harth (1992)= Jill Harth alleged that Trump assaulted her several times. Harth has stated that in December 1992, while dining with Trump and her then-boyfriend George Houraney, Trump attempted to put his hands between her legs. Harth and Houraney visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in January 1993 for a contract-signing celebration. Trump, according to Harth, offered her a tour before pulling her into the empty bedroom of his daughter Ivanka. \\"I was admiring the decoration, and next thing I know he's pushing me against a wall and has his hands all over me. He was trying to kiss me. I was freaking out.\\" Harth says she desperately protested against Trump's advances and eventually managed to run out of the room. She and her boyfriend left rather than stay the night, as they had intended. After she became engaged, Harth alleges, Trump began to stalk her. Harth filed a lawsuit in 1997 in which she accused Trump of non-consensual groping of her body, among them her \\"intimate private parts\\", and \\"relentless\\" sexual harassment. The suit was withdrawn after Houraney settled with Trump for an undisclosed amount in a lawsuit that claimed Trump had backed out of a business deal. She still claims to have been sexually assaulted and although he was never violent with her, she says his actions were \\"unwanted and aggressive, very sexually aggressive\\". Following the incident, Harth said she received \\"a couple years of therapy\\". In 2015 she contacted Trump's campaign to get a job as a makeup artist and sell her men's cosmetic product line. She later said, \\"Yes, I had moved on but had not forgotten the pain [Trump] brought into my life. I was older, wiser. Trump was married to Melania and I had hoped he was a changed man.\\" She worked at one of Trump's rallies as a makeup artist. Of the experience, she said: \\"I'm a makeup artist. The guy is a mess, OK? He really needed my services, and I'm a makeup artist that needs a job. Why would, if I was on friendly terms, why wouldn't I try to get that job?\\" Harth's lawsuit was first published in February 2016 by LawNewz.com. Her case was first published in May 2016 in The New York Times article \\"Crossing the Line\\". Trump characterized her story in the Times as \\"false, malicious and libelous\\" and he \\"strongly denies the claims\\". Harth stood by her charges in a July 2016 interview with The Guardian. In October 2016, she said that, if sued by Trump, she intends to counter-sue. =E. Jean Carroll (1995 or 1996)= On November 4, 2019, writer E. Jean Carroll filed a lawsuit against Trump, accusing him of defamation by claiming she lied. The author, who had first publicly disclosed the alleged sexual assault by Trump in June, said Trump's reaction to the accusation has directly harmed her career and reputation. Carroll said she was filing this lawsuit on behalf of each woman who has faced harassment, assault, or belittlement. Furthermore, Trump has stated that her allegation was just a promotion strategy for her book titled What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal, where she discloses details about the alleged assault. The White House Press Secretary responded to the lawsuit claiming it was \\"frivolous\\" and that the story was fake, \\"just like the author\\". In September 2020, the Justice Department filed a court motion seeking to take over Trump's defense, arguing he had acted \\"within the scope\\" of the presidency when he called Carroll a liar. The Justice Department also moved the case to a federal court from a state court which the previous month had denied a motion by Trump's attorney to delay the case, which was about to enter the discovery phase. During discovery, Trump could be required to provide a deposition, as well as a DNA sample to compare to genetic material purportedly found on the dress Carroll says she was wearing during the alleged sexual assault. Attorney general Bill Barr asserted the move was a routine application of the Westfall Act that permits the Justice Department to defend federal employees against civil liability for acts conducted in the normal course of their duties. Barr stated the White House had requested the Justice Department action and noted that taxpayers would pay any judgment should Carroll win the case. The next month, the Justice Department asserted in a court filing that the president should not be held liable in a personal suit because he spoke in his official capacity as president, an argument that ‚Äî if accepted by the court ‚Äî would have the practical effect of dismissing the suit because government employees largely enjoy immunity from defamation suits. =Summer Zervos (2007)= Summer Zervos was a contestant on the fifth season of The Apprentice, which filmed in 2005 and aired in 2006. Subsequently, she contacted Trump in 2007, about a job after the show's completion, and he invited her to meet him at The Beverly Hills Hotel. Zervos has said that Trump was sexually suggestive during their meeting, kissing her open-mouthed, groping her breasts, and thrusting his genitals on her. She also has said that his behavior was aggressive and not consensual. Zervos is being represented by attorney Gloria Allred. John Barry, her cousin and a Trump supporter, has said Zervos talked to her family and friends about Trump, promoting his candidacy and stating how Trump had helped her out in her life. Barry said that during the presidential primary campaign, Zervos invited Trump to her restaurant, and he declined. In October 2016, the Trump presidential campaign released an email by Zervos, sent to Trump's secretary in April 2016, in which she stated: \\"I would greatly appreciate reconnecting at this time. He will know my intentions are genuine.\\" Zervos said she had intended to confront Trump and give him the \\"opportunity to clear the air\\". On April 21, she sent another email to Trump's assistant which she asked to be forwarded to Trump, in which she stated: \\"I have been incredibly hurt by our previous interaction.\\" On January 17, 2017, Zervos filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump, arising from his statement that she had lied about the allegations. Marc Kasowitz is defending Trump in the case. Zervos has filed a subpoena for \\"all documents concerning any woman who asserted that Donald J. Trump touched her inappropriately\\". On March 21, 2018, a New York Supreme Court judge decided to allow a defamation lawsuit against the President to go forward.CNN.com: Trump attorney will appeal judge's decision in Summer Zervos defamation case time.com 22 March 2018: Why the Summer Zervos Lawsuit Against President Trump Matters On June 4, 2018, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter ruled that Trump must be deposed by January 31, 2019. , Trump will provide written answers under oath in the defamation lawsuit.washingtonpost.com September9, 2018: Trump to provide written answers under oath in Summer Zervos defamation lawsuit On March 14, 2019, a New York appeals court rejected President Trump's argument that the Constitution makes him immune from state lawsuits, clearing the way for a defamation suit.nytimes.com: Trump Can Be Sued for Defamation by Summer Zervos, 'Apprentice' Contestant, Court Rules see also Clinton v. Jones On November 2, 2019, Trump agreed to submit to questioning under oath by January 31, 2020. In January 2020, a New York intermediate appellate court put the defamation lawsuit on hold, until a New York court of appeals could decide the fate of the case. The case hold meant that the January 31, 2020 deadline for Trump to testify was also put on hold. =Alva Johnson (2019)= On February 25, 2019, Alva Johnson filed a lawsuit against Trump, alleging he had forcibly kissed her at a rally in Florida in August 2016 while she was working on his 2016 presidential campaign. Johnson said two people‚Äîincluding Pam Bondi, then the attorney general of Florida‚Äîsaw the kiss, but both denied it. According to an interview with Teen Vogue, Johnson decided to stop working for the Trump campaign after the media started covering the Access Hollywood tape. She declared sick days until she could speak to a lawyer. In addition to the \\"unwanted sexual attention\\", the lawsuit also alleges that Johnson was \\"a victim of race and gender discrimination through unequal pay\\". In response, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the lawsuit \\"absurd on its face\\". May 2016 New York Times story In May 2016, The New York Times published the article \\"Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved with Women in Private\\". For the article, Times reporters Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey conducted 50 interviews with women who had known Trump socially, during their professional career, or while modeling or competing for a beauty pageant title. Other women interviewed for the story, a few of whom had worked for Trump, stated they had not received unwanted advances and \\"they had never known Mr. Trump to objectify women or treat them with disrespect.\\" Jill Martin, a vice president and assistant counsel at the company, said Trump was supportive of her and her role as a mother. Laura Kirilova Chukanov, a Bulgarian immigrant and 2009 Miss USA pageant contestant, said Trump helped her make connections for a documentary she was working on about her home country. Rowanne Brewer Lane, Trump's former girlfriend, was quoted at length in the article and was featured in the opening anecdote. Following the article's publication, Brewer Lane accused The New York Times of taking her quotes out of context and said she was \\"flattered\\" and not insulted by Trump. Trump spokesperson Barry Bennett responded to the story by stating: \\"They talked to 50 women and managed to put seven or eight in the story. Over half of them had great things to say. The one that had great things to say, they twisted it and called her debased which is not how she feels.\\" The New York Times defended the story and said Brewer Lane was \\"quoted fairly, accurately and at length\\". Recording controversy and second 2016 presidential debate Billy Bush was recorded having \\"an extremely lewd conversation about women\\" with Trump in 2005. Two days before the second 2016 presidential debate, the 2005 Access Hollywood tape was released, which records Trump having \\"an extremely lewd conversation about women\\" in which he described being able to kiss and grope women because he was \\"a star\\": \\"You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful‚ÄîI just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything... grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\\" Many attorneys and media commentators have said Trump's statements described sexual assault. On October 7, Trump released a video statement in which he stated, \\"I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.\\" He called the development a distraction and attempted to deflect attention to the Clintons, and in particular sexual assault scandals involving Bill Clinton. Republican critics called on him to withdraw from the presidential race. During the second debate, Anderson Cooper asked Trump if he understood that he had bragged about sexually assaulting women. Cooper used the Justice Department's sexual assault definition to include \\"any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient\\". Trump denied having said that he had sexually assaulted women. He claimed the comments were merely \\"locker room talk\\", then, after being asked three times whether he had ever kissed or groped any person without consent, he said \\"no I have not\\". Several of his subsequent accusers said this was the moment at which they were motivated to come forward. Public allegations since 2016 =Jessica Leeds (1980s)= In the early 1980s, Leeds was a businesswoman at a paper company on a flight from the Midwest, returning to New York. A flight attendant offered her an empty seat in the first-class cabin next to Trump. Leeds alleged that about 45 minutes after takeoff, Trump lifted the armrest and began touching her, grabbing her breasts, and tried to put his hand up her skirt. \\"He was like an octopus,\\" she said. \\"His hands were everywhere. It was an assault.\\" Leeds said she had sent a letter containing her allegations to the editor of The New York Times. Her story was printed by The New York Times in October 2016, along with the account from Rachel Crooks. Trump spokesman Jason Miller responded to the allegation calling it \\"fiction\\". Miller stated the charges were politically motivated \\"for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all.\\" Trump publicly threatened to sue the Times over the newspaper's publication of the allegation, and demanded a retraction.Alan Rappeport, Donald Trump Threatens to Sue The Times Over Article on Unwanted Advances , The New York Times (October 13, 2016). The Times rejected Trump's retraction demand,Dylan Byers & Brian Stelter, New York Times to Donald Trump: We won't retract , CNNMoney (October 13, 2016). and Trump never followed through on his threat to take legal action against the company. An alleged witness to the case who claimed he saw \\"nothing untoward\\" upon the flight was former British Conservative county councillor from Gloucestershire, Antony Gilberthorpe. Gilberthorpe has previously made false allegations against politicians and has been previously accused of making \\"advances of an intimate nature\\" towards Conservative students. =Kristin Anderson (1990s)= On October 14, 2016, The Washington Post reported an allegation by Kristin Anderson. Anderson said that Trump groped her beneath her skirt in a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s. An aspiring model at the time of the alleged incident, Anderson told the story to her friends, and decided to come forward after reading accounts of other women who had done so. Anderson believed the alleged assault occurred at the China Club, a Manhattan nightclub that Newsday referred to as \\"Donald's Monday-night nest\\" due to his alleged habit of picking up women there. =Lisa Boyne (1996)= On October 13, 2016, The Huffington Post reported an allegation by Lisa Boyne. Boyne said Sonja Morgan (then Sonja Tremont) invited her to a dinner with Trump, modeling agent John Casablancas, and five or six models. Boyne alleged that Trump made the models walk across the table, looked under their skirts, and described if they were wearing underwear. Morgan told The Huffington Post that the dinner took place with those participants, did not recall lewd behaviour by Trump, and said: \\"But I have been known to dance on tables.\\" Boyne said she called her roommate Karen Beatrice that night to inform her about the incident. The Huffington Post contacted Beatrice, who denied any such call. =Cathy Heller (1997)= On October 15, 2016, The Guardian reported an allegation by Cathy Heller that she was grabbed and kissed by Donald Trump two decades earlier. Heller said that, in 1997, she met Trump when she attended a Mother's Day brunch with her children, her husband, and her husband's parents at his Mar-a- Lago estate. Her parents-in-law were members of Mar-a-Lago. Heller was introduced to Trump, who became angry when she avoided a kiss. He then \\"grabbed\\" her and, when he tried to kiss her, she turned her head. Trump kissed her on the side of the mouth \\"for a little too long\\" and then he left her. Heller's husband and children, who were present during the event, have corroborated her account. In the summer of 2015, the members of Heller's mahjong group heard Heller's account of the 1997 incident; this was not long after Trump announced his candidacy. She decided to go public after seeing the second presidential debate on October 9, 2016. Heller is a registered Democrat, and public supporter of Hillary Clinton. Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller said Heller's account is \\"false\\" and \\"politically motivated\\". =Temple Taggart McDowell (1997)= In May 2016, The New York Times reported allegations by Temple Taggart McDowell. McDowell, who was Miss Utah USA in 1997, accused Trump of unwanted kisses and embraces that left McDowell and one of her chaperones so uncomfortable, according to McDowell, that she claimed she was instructed not to be left in a room alone with him again. According to McDowell, a chaperone had accompanied her to Trump's office. At the time, McDowell was 21 and was known as Temple Taggart. This incident occurred in Trump's first year of ownership of the Miss USA contest. McDowell told her story initially to The New York Times in May 2016 which was published in the \\"Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private\\" article. She had not intended to speak publicly about the incidents again, but she received numerous calls recently due to the \\"Crossing the Line\\" article and felt, as a mother, that it is important to share a message about unwanted advances: \\"You have the right to say no. You have the right to get out of there. You have the right to leave, and you have the right to make them feel uncomfortable if they're making you feel uncomfortable,\\" she said. Trump said he does not know her and denied McDowell's claims. He also told The New York Times he is \\"reluctant to kiss strangers on the lips\\". Taggart McDowell said she is a Republican, and not coming out with the allegation in order to support Hillary Clinton. =Amy Dorris (1997)= Former model Amy Dorris said in September 2020 that she and her boyfriend, Jason Binn, attended the 1997 U.S. Open with Donald Trump, who Binn had described as his best friend. She alleges that Trump groped and kissed her without her consent at the event. The Guardian confirmed that she told her mother and a friend in New York immediately after the incident and that she had told her therapist and several other friends about it over the years; Binn did not reply to the Guardian‚Äôs request for comment. Trump denied the allegation via his lawyers. Former top model Caron Bernstein stated that her husband was the New York friend and that Dorris had told her about the assault in 2008. =Karena Virginia (1998)= At an October 2016 press conference with attorney Gloria Allred, yoga instructor and life coach Karena Virginia said that in 1998 Trump grabbed her arm and touched her breast. Virginia, who was 27 years old at the time, was waiting for a ride after the US Open in Queens, New York. She said Trump, whom she had not met previously, approached her with a small group of other men, while commenting on her legs, then he grabbed her right arm. Virginia continued, \\"Then his hand touched the right side of my breast. I was in shock. I flinched. 'Don't you know who I am? Don't you know who I am?'‚Äîthat's what he said to me. I felt intimidated and I felt powerless.\\" Trump campaign spokesperson Jessica Ditto responded to the allegation with a statement reading in part, \\"Discredited political operative Gloria Allred, in another coordinated, publicity seeking attack with the Clinton campaign, will stop at nothing to smear Mr. Trump.\\" =Karen Johnson (early 2000s)= In Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy's book All the President‚Äôs Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator, Karen Johnson alleged that she attended a New Year's Eve party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, where Trump grabbed her by her genitals, pulled her behind a tapestry, and forcibly kissed her. Johnson also alleged that days after the incident, Trump repeatedly called her (without her giving him the phone number), offering to fly her to meet him, which she rejected. The book states that Johnson told a friend about the incident years before Trump ran for president. =Mindy McGillivray (2003)= In an October 2016 article by The Palm Beach Post, Mindy McGillivray stated that in January 2003, when she was 23 years old, she was groped by Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. She said, \\"All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it's [my friend Ken Davidoff's] camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there's Donald. He sort of looked away quickly.\\" Ken Davidoff, a photographer, corroborated McGillivray's account, saying he remembered her pulling him aside moments after the alleged incident to say \\"Donald just grabbed my ass!\\" McGillivray said she \\"chose to stay quiet\\" and never reported the incident to authorities. She had shared details of the incident only with close family and friends until she heard Trump deny such behavior during the second presidential debate on October 9, 2016. Hope Hicks, Trump's press secretary, said McGillivray's allegations lacked \\"any merit or veracity\\" and were untruthful. Ken Davidoff's brother, Darryl Davidoff, said he was also present at the time at Mar-a-Lago and that in his opinion McGillivray is lying. According to Darryl: \\"I do not believe it really happened. Nobody saw it happen and she just wanted to be in the limelight.\\" =Jennifer Murphy (2005)= In early October 2016, Grazia reported an allegation by Jennifer Murphy, a former contestant on the fourth season of The Apprentice. Murphy said that in 2005, after Trump had recently married Melania Knauss, she had a job interview with Trump. When she was leaving, Trump kissed her on the lips, which took her by surprise. Murphy said Trump had offered her job interviews a day after she had left The Apprentice, that she ultimately declined his job offer, and that she would still vote for Trump in the 2016 election. Murphy was invited to Trump Tower for a job interview, and Trump allegedly kissed her on the elevator while dropping her on the way out. Murphy elaborated that she had hoped Trump would remain true to his marriage and consider the fact that she was also engaged at the time. She also disclosed that Trump made multiple comments about her appearance during work, and that the editors had to cut it out. However, Murphy said that she wouldn't want Trump to feel like she's \\"throwing him under the bus\\", as it did not \\"really bother [her]\\". =Rachel Crooks (2005)= In 2005, Rachel Crooks was a 22-year-old receptionist at Bayrock Group, a real estate investment and development company in Trump Tower in Manhattan. She says she encountered Trump in an elevator in the building one morning and turned to introduce herself. They shook hands, but Trump would not let go. Instead, he began kissing her cheeks, then directly on the mouth. \\"It was so inappropriate,\\" Crooks recalled in an interview. \\"I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.\\" Her story was printed by The New York Times in October 2016, along with that of Jessica Leeds. Trump has disputed Crooks' claims, writing on Twitter, \\"Who would do this in a public space with live security cameras running?\\" Crooks is a public supporter and donor to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. =Natasha Stoynoff (2005)= Canadian author and journalist Natasha Stoynoff, who wrote for People magazine and, previously, the Toronto Star and Toronto Sun, went to Trump's Florida estate in December 2005 to interview him and his wife, Melania. While there, Trump gave Stoynoff a tour of the Mar-a-Lago estate. She says that during this tour, he pushed her against a wall and forced his tongue into her mouth. Stoynoff described the alleged episode, \\"We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat... I was stunned. And I was grateful when Trump's longtime butler burst into the room a minute later, as I tried to unpin myself.\\" Stoynoff composed herself and conducted the interview, after which she said Trump repeatedly told her, \\"We're going to have an affair, I'm telling you.\\" Melania was also interviewed for that article. Trump sent out a tweet on October 13, 2016, in which he said it had not happened and wondered why she had not mentioned the event in her People article of 2005. Stoynoff responded that she had become angry when Trump denied assaulting women during the presidential debate and was triggered by the release of the Access Hollywood recording in early October. Until that point, she said, she had conflicting emotions common among victims of assault, combined with embarrassment and confusion. J.D. Heyman, Peoples deputy editor, said: \\"It was disorienting for her. She felt a great deal of worry and distress about it. Then she felt angry.\\" That same day, Melania's lawyer demanded an apology from People magazine, stating that Melania did not say some or all of what was quoted in the People article by Stoynoff published on October 12, 2016; Melania specifically denied Stoynoff's claim that she'd run into her on Fifth Avenue following the article's publication. In an interview with Anderson Cooper that aired October 17 on CNN, Melania again denied having crossed paths with Stoynoff on Fifth Avenue, as stated in Stoynoff's article. The following day, People published the account of Liza Herz. Herz said she witnessed the sidewalk encounter between Stoynoff and Melania Trump; Herz' account corroborated that of Stoynoff. On October 18, People produced six corroborating witnesses who said Stoynoff had recounted the incident to them around the time it occurred. The six witnesses were: \\"two editors from People, Mary Green and Liz McNeil; a professor of journalism, Paul McLaughlin; a co-worker; and two personal friends of Ms. Stoynoff\\". Trump's former butler at Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Anthony Senecal, 85, was asked about the 2005 incident in which Stoynoff alleged that the butler had \\"burst in\\" on Trump while she was pinned down by him; Senecal denied it ever happened, stating that as a butler \\"I don't burst in. I knock, then I go in, usually after someone says 'come in',\\" further alleging \\"And when I went in, there was nothing strange about where she was standing.\\" According to Senecal, the alleged incident took place in an old massage room with windows all around which made it unsuitable to grope anyone since there was no privacy. =Juliet Huddy (2005 or 2006)= In early December 2017, the reporter Juliet Huddy said Trump kissed her on the lips while they were on an elevator in Trump Tower with Trump's security guard in 2005 or 2006. Regarding this incident, Huddy said \\"I was surprised that he went for the lips. But I didn't feel threatened... Whatever, everything was fine. It was a weird moment. He never tried anything after that, and I was never alone with him.\\" =Jessica Drake (2006)= On October 22, 2016, Jessica Drake and attorney Gloria Allred held a news conference in which Drake accused Trump of having sexually assaulted her by grabbing tightly in a hug and kissed her and two acquaintances nearly ten years prior. Drake, an adult film actress and sex education advocate, said she met Trump at her company's booth during a charity golf tournament at Lake Tahoe in 2006. Drake claims she was invited to meet with Trump, who was married at the time, at his hotel suite; she was \\"uncomfortable going alone\\" and brought two friends. Describing the meeting with Trump, Drake recounted that \\"He grabbed each of us tightly, in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking permission.\\" Drake said she and her friends left the suite after 30‚Äì45 minutes. Shortly thereafter, Drake claims she received phone calls from Trump or his associate, requesting that she join him in his suite for $10,000, and offering to fly her on his jet back to Los Angeles. She said she declined his offers. During the news conference, Drake said, \\"I am not looking for monetary compensation. I do not need additional fame... I understand that I may be called a liar or an opportunist but I will risk that in order to stand in solidarity with women who share similar accounts.\\" During the news conference, Gloria Allred held up a picture showing Trump and Drake standing together at the time. In response to Drake's allegations, the Trump campaign stated that her story is \\"false and ridiculous\\", that \\"[t]he picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump\\" but Trump did not know Drake and \\"would have no interest in ever knowing her\\", and that the story was \\"just another attempt by the Clinton campaign to defame a candidate\\". Donald Trump appeared to dismiss the significance of the accusation because of Drake's line of work, saying, \\"Oh, I'm sure she's never been grabbed before.\\" =Ninni Laaksonen (2006)= On October 27, 2016, a local Finnish tabloid, Ilta-Sanomat, reported an allegation by Ninni Laaksonen, Miss Finland 2006. Laaksonen appeared with Trump on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 26, 2006. Laaksonen claims that before they went on the air, Trump grabbed her buttocks. As Laaksonen describes the interaction: \\"He really grabbed my butt. I don't think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought: \\"What is happening?\\" Someone later told Laaksonen that Trump liked her because she looked like his wife, Melania, when she was younger. Laaksonen revealed her account to a local Finnish tabloid, Ilta- Sanomat, which had contacted her regarding the level of professionalism involved in Donald Trump's handling of his employees within the Miss Universe pageant. The story was published on October 27, 2016. =Cassandra Searles (2013)= Rolling Stone and NPR have reported that Cassandra Searles, Miss Washington USA of 2013, was fondled by Trump without her consent during the Miss USA pageant of that year. In June 2016, Searles wrote that Trump invited her to his hotel room. Yahoo!News published an article in June 2016 stating that Searles had made Facebook postings that accused Trump of making unwanted advances. She said he was \\"continually\\" groping her buttocks and had asked her to go \\"to his hotel room\\". Searles also asserted that Trump had \\"treated us like cattle\\". Trump and his campaign have not specifically responded to Searles' allegations. Pageant dressing room visits Trump owned the Miss Universe franchise, which includes Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, from 1996 to 2015. In a Howard Stern interview in 2005, he said he made a practice of walking into the contestants' dressing rooms unannounced while the women were undressed: In that interview, Trump declined to say whether he had slept with any contestants, saying, \\"It could be a conflict of interest\\". Stern then imitated a foreign contestant (\\"Mr. Trump, in my country, we say hello with vagina\\"), and Trump jokingly responded, \\"Well, you could also say, as the owner of the pageant, it's your obligation to do that.\\"\\"How Trump's coarse statements will influence female voters\\" , CBS News (October 10, 2016). Contestants of the shows have specifically alleged that Trump entered the dressing rooms while they were in various stages of undress in 1997, 2000, 2001, and 2006. =Mariah Billado, Victoria Hughes, and three other Miss Teen USA contestants (1997)= Mariah Billado, Miss Vermont Teen USA, is one of five women to mention such a dressing room visit incident in 1997. Billado said of the visit: \\"I remember putting on my dress really quick, because I was like, 'Oh my god, there's a man in here.' Trump, she recalled, said something like, 'Don't worry, ladies, I've seen it all before.'\\" Billado recalled talking to Ivanka, Trump's daughter, who responded \\"Yeah, he does that.\\" Victoria Hughes, Miss New Mexico Teen USA, also said Trump did conduct a dressing room visit, and that the youngest contestant there was 15. The dressing room had 51 contestants, each with their own stations. Eleven girls said they did not see Trump enter the dressing room, though some said it was possible that he had entered while they were somewhere else, or that they didn't notice. Of the 15 former contestants who were interviewed by BuzzFeed News, none alleged Trump said anything sexually explicit or made physical contact in the dressing room, and reportedly \\"Most of the former contestants were doubtful or dismissed the possibility that Trump violated their changing room privacy.\\" Allison Bowman, Miss Wisconsin Teen USA, expressed skepticism: \\"these were teenage girls. If anything inappropriate had gone on, the gossip would have flown.\\" Trump's campaign stated the allegations of his entering the dressing room \\"have no merit and have already been disproven by many other individuals who were present\\". =Bridget Sullivan (2000)= In 2000, Bridget Sullivan was Miss New Hampshire USA. As she prepared for a television broadcast, Trump allegedly walked into the dressing room. She told BuzzFeed he was coming to wish the contestants good luck, but they \\"were all naked\\". Some contestants that night do not remember his entering while the ladies prepared and other contestants mentioned that they had no negative experiences with Trump. A spokesman for Trump said Sullivan's claims were \\"totally false\\". =Tasha Dixon (2001)= Tasha Dixon, Miss Arizona USA 2001, told a CBS affiliate in Los Angeles that in 2001, \\"[Trump] just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless, other girls were naked.\\" She said that having been walked in on when the women had little or no clothes put them in a \\"very physically vulnerable position, and then to have the pressure of the people that work for him telling us to go fawn all over him, go walk up to him, talk to him...\\" Another contestant, Miss California USA Carrie Prejean Boller, told the same CBS affiliate it was wrong to paint Trump that way.\\"Former Beauty Queen: Contestants Were Forced To Greet Trump Even When Not Fully Dressed\\" , CBS Los Angeles (October 11, 2016). Trump's response, provided through spokeswoman Jessica Ditto, is that: \\"These accusations have no merit and have already been disproven by many other individuals who were present,\\" Ditto adds that she believes there is a political motivation behind the accusation. =Unnamed contestants (2001)= An unnamed Miss USA contestant said that in 2001 Trump walked into her dressing room unannounced while she and another contestant were undressed. She told The Guardian Trump \\"just barged right in, didn't say anything, stood there and stared at us.... He didn't walk in and say, 'Oh, I'm so sorry, I was looking for someone.' He walked in, he stood and he stared. He was doing it because he knew that he could.\\" Another contestant told The Guardian the contestant had spoken to others of this event at the time. =Samantha Holvey (2006)= On October 14, 2016, Samantha Carol Holvey, Miss North Carolina USA 2006, related that \\"Trump's conduct was 'creepy' around the women participating but he never made an advance toward her.\\" She also said that before pageant events, Trump had \\"moved into areas where she and other contestants were getting ready\\", and that she had \\"never been around men that were like that\\". More than a year after Trump was elected president, and after many high-profile men, such as Harvey Weinstein, had lost their jobs because of sexual harassment allegations, Holvey wrote: \\"You can't work in Hollywood if you're a sexual predator, but you can become the commander-in-chief?\\" She then related how Trump made her feel very uncomfortable at the 2006 Miss USA pageant: \\"He eyed me like a piece of meat. I was shocked and disgusted. I have never felt so objectified. I left the meet-and-greet hoping that this would be my one and only encounter with him.\\" She also described how he had come backstage unannounced, with Melania Trump: \\"I was shocked‚Äîagain‚Äîby this violation of our personal space. What was he doing, coming backstage when we were still getting dressed?\\" Other incidents In 1992, Trump appeared on NBC News' show A Closer Look, hosted by Faith Daniels. During the show, Daniels said Trump (divorced at the time) agreed to make an appearance because: \\"You kissed me on the lips in front of the paparazzi, and I said, 'That'll cost you. I'm booking you on the show.'\\" Trump replied that the kiss was \\"so open and nice\\", and that he thought Daniels' husband \\"had his back turned at the time\\". Trump had invited NBC News to film a party he threw for himself and Jeffrey Epstein at Mar-a-Lago, where they joined various NFL cheerleaders; the kiss incident occurred there. NBC News revealed footage of the party in July 2019, showing Trump, Epstein and the cheerleaders. At one point during the video, Trump grabbed a woman around her waist, pulled her against his body, and patted her buttocks. At another point, Trump appears to tell Epstein: \\"Look at her, back there... She's hot.\\" A 2002 article in New York magazine quoted Trump talking about Jeffery Epstein: \\"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\\" In 2008, Epstein plead guilty to charges involving child prostitution. In 2019, he was charged with child sex trafficking, he died in his cell before facing trial. Reactions =Comparisons to other behavior= Shaun R. Harper, executive director of the Penn Graduate Center for Education, has said that \\"many men talk like Donald Trump\\"; objectifying women and saying offensive things about them. He puts Trump in a class of men whose behavior sometimes includes sexual assault and degrading women. The Economist drew similar parallels, pointing to research that objectifying women can make sexual assault more likely. NPR reported that Trump has exhibited questionable behavior in his treatment of women for some time, using offensive language to describe women including Megyn Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian called his past remarks a \\"masterclass in rape culture\\", pointing to statements such as \\"26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military‚Äîonly 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?\\" and \\"women, you have to treat 'em like shit.\\" On October 13, 2016, a transcript from a 1994 Primetime Live interview was unearthed where Trump states \\"I tell friends who treat their wives magnificently, get treated like crap in return, 'Be rougher and you'll see a different relationship.'\\" =Donald Trump's self-assessment= A Voice of America video showing Trump stating, \\"I have no idea who these women are.\\" Trump has presented himself as a political martyr in the face of these accusations. He declared \\"this is a conspiracy against you, the American people\\", saying \\"the Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund it exist for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself\\" and that \\"the Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure.\\" In his next speech, he said New York Times reporters are \\"corporate lobbyists\\" for minority shareholder Carlos Slim and Hillary Clinton, suggesting Slim's motivation is that he \\"comes from Mexico\\". Trump also said the accusers may instead have been motivated by fame or money. He went on to wonder why President Barack Obama had not been accused yet, and denied the Jessica Leeds allegation by saying \\"she would not be my first choice.\\" In the third presidential debate, Trump repeated his claims: \\"I think they want either fame or her campaign did it and I think it's her campaign.\\" At a speech at Gettysburg outlining his vision for his first 100 days, he repeated his denials and stated \\"all of these liars will be sued after the election is over.\\" To date, however, Trump has not filed suit against any of his accusers. =Trump family= Melania Trump has responded to the allegations by charging Trump's accusers with lying. Melania has insisted her husband is a \\"gentleman\\" and claimed that he had become a victim of a conspiracy involving the news media and the Clinton campaign. Melania also advocates that it is important to check the background of these women before confiding in them, as the accusations can be a strategy of the opposition party to defame the President. Although Ivanka Trump has claimed to be shocked over Trump's 2005 lewd Access Hollywood tapes, calling them \\"inappropriate and offensive\\", she has refused directly to address the issue of her father's alleged sexual assault. In contrast, Donald Trump Jr. described the 2005 comments as \\"a fact of life\\", and Eric Trump dismissed all allegations of assault as \\"dirty tricks\\" from the Clinton campaign. =Trump campaign= Leeds's and Crooks's allegations, published by The New York Times on October 13, were disputed by Trump's campaign as having \\"no merit or veracity\\". The campaign alleged that the Times had a vendetta against Trump. The Los Angeles Times stated that they verified the stories with friends and family members of the accusers to ensure that the stories had been relayed to them earlier. The Trump campaign issued this statement through its spokesman Jason Miller: Trump's campaign staff also stated that the Stoynoff and McGillivray accusations were without merit. =Trump's attorneys= Trump's attorneys demanded a retraction of the Times article and an apology for what they said was a \\"libelous article\\"‚Äîdefamation designed to destroy Trump's run for president. David McCraw, assistant general counsel for the Times, responded on October 13, 2016, to the libel claims from Trump's attorney. He said Trump's reputation is damaged and \\"could not be further affected\\" due to his own statements, like those he made on the Howard Stern show. McCraw continues, \\"it would have been a disservice not just to our readers but to democracy itself to silence [the accusers'] voices.\\" In response to the request to retract the story, McCraw said, \\"We decline to do so\\" and that Trump was free to pursue the matter in court. Trump's attorney, Michael D. Cohen, has defended Trump by saying the accusers are not women Trump would find to be attractive. =The Trump administration= In October 2017, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked if \\"the official White House position that all of these women are lying\\", in reference to the sexual harassment claims against Trump by at least 16 women. Sanders replied, \\"Yeah, we've been clear on that from the beginning, and the president's spoken on it\\". In November 2017, Trump criticized Senator Al Franken in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against Franken. This resulted in Sanders describing \\"a very clear distinction\\" between the allegations against Trump and Franken: \\"Franken has admitted wrongdoing and the president hasn't\\". In December 2017, after several of Trump's accusers called on Trump to resign, Sanders said, \\"the president has addressed these accusations directly and denied all of these allegations, [which] took place long before he was elected.\\" Since Americans elected Trump to office \\"at a decisive election\\", Sanders said, \\"we feel like these allegations have been answered through that process.\\" =#WhyWomenDontReport= The hashtag #WhyWomenDontReport started trending on Twitter in response to the Trump campaign's statements that the accusers lack credibility. Many commentators disputed the claim that the timing of the allegations during the presidential campaign has a bearing on how likely the events were. The range of reasons given for why women are reluctant to immediately report sexual assault included fear of reprisals, fear that no one will believe them, the low likelihood of obtaining justice against the assailant, and the traumatic experience of having to be reminded of the event. Liz Plank points out that Trump's accusers are now experiencing all these factors since coming forward. Civil rights lawyer Debra Katz and others point out that high-profile cases tend to encourage victims to speak up, even years later. Tom Tremblay, a police specialist in sexual assault, says: \\"Victims may wait days, weeks, months, years, decades... When one victim comes forward, it's not at all uncommon to see other victims come forward, who are thinking, 'Well, they came forward; now it's not just my word.'\\" Susan Dominus, writing for The New York Times Magazine, hopes this backlash against Trump will lead to more people believing women's stories in the future. =Smear allegations= Washington Times online opinion editor and Fox News contributor Monica Crowley said in October 2016 that the accusations come across as a \\"classical political hit job\\" on Trump. Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt said the allegations were \\"definitely coordinated\\" and questioned why the media had given more coverage to the allegations than the Podesta emails. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said he was not skeptical of the stories, but \\"I think it's good to be skeptical when you have stories that are 30 years old that come out days before an election.\\" Fox News Media analyst Howard Kurtz wrote in a column that it was \\"possible to find the allegations troubling while also questioning their timing and whether it's no accident that the women are breaking their silence a month before the election.\\" =Michelle Obama's speech= The day after The New York Times reported the allegations, First Lady Michelle Obama delivered a widely praised speech on women's experiences of sexism and sexually predatory behavior. Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post said the speech \\"will go down as one of the most important of this political cycle, a moment in which she crystallized the feelings of many women in the wake of the Trump tape\\". Michelle Obama had planned to deliver her normal campaign speech, but said during her speech it would have been \\"dishonest and disingenuous\\" to do so, as she felt compelled to address Trump's remarks on women. The speech was \\"a message she'd been seeking to deliver for a long time about Donald Trump's cruel language toward women\\". In her speech Obama denounced the Trump tape and Trump's alleged advances: \\"This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women... And to make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn't an isolated incident.\\" Her speech discussed the history of similar behavior, and the obstacles it places in women's lives, her voice occasionally trembling with emotion: =Public response= A survey conducted by YouGov in October 2016 found that 43 percent of respondents found the allegations to be credible. Republicans were least likely to find the allegations credible, and only 19 percent of Republicans thought sexual assault would disqualify Trump from the presidency. A year after the election, and after the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and subsequent Me Too movement, 86 percent of Clinton voters found the allegations credible, while only six percent of Trump voters did.

B.A. was a doctor and minister who travelled to China to work as a medical missionary with the Wesleyan Methodist Ministry.  Early life  Rees was born on 8 January 1877 in Northampton, England, the son of the Rev. Allen Rees and his wife, Eleanore. He attended Woodhouse Grove School in Apperley Bridge, Yorkshire, and then took his B.A from the University of London via correspondence in 1895. He took his B.Sc. in 1897, and then entered Didsbury College, Bristol to study theology. He was recommended to take a position as a medical missionary with the Wesleyan Methodist Ministry in China, but financial constraints kept him from taking this up for some time.  Career and mission to China  Rees won the David H. Llewellyn Scholarship at Charing Cross Hospital, which paid for his medical education fees for five years. He won the David Livingstone Scholarship during this course, as well as ten other prizes, which enabled him to continue his training toward an M.B. from the University of London. He was still preaching in and around London at the same time. He was ordained in December 1904, and was offered a mission in Foshan, China. He sailed in March 1905. He arrived in Hong Kong a month later, before making his home in Foshan, near Canton to work at the hospital there. Foshan was a booming industrial centre, with three million people in the surrounding area. Previous doctors had only lasted a year at the hospital due to overwork. There were considerable language issues, and an adjustment to the climate. Rees felt isolated and alone, suffering from overwork and homesickness. Visits to Hong Kong and the English community there encouraged him to persist with his religious and medical work. He was transferred to the Wuzhou hospital after one of his colleagues fell ill. Rees married Ethel Craske of London in Hong Kong, in December 1907. They made their home in Wuzhou. Their son, Allen Rees was born in 1909. Rees published in the medical journal, The Lancet in 1908 describing the primitive knowledge of midwifery practised by some of the village people he met. Rees' health was suffering considerably from the strains of his work and their life in China. They sailed for England in February 1910, staying with his wife, Ethel's family in Battersea, London. He used this time in England to recuperate from malaria and complete his M.D. degree from the University of London. He continued to preach extensively throughout England. Doctors were not happy however regarding his health which had suffered consistently in China. The Rees' returned to China in September 1911, their daughter, Nancy Rees having been born in England in October 1910. The Chinese Revolt of 1911 had the Imperial army engaged in fighting with revolutionary soldiers near Wuzhou, which increased the number of patients being admitted to the hospital. Rees' health continued to decline and following a vacation to Hong Kong, he suffered from an acute attack of appendicitis. It progressed to peritonitis and Rees died on 3 August 1912. Rees was survived by his wife and children, who returned to England.

Brewer is one of the individuals responsible for the formation of the genre of Rogue Taxidermy, a variety of mixed media art. A primary directive throughout her career has been the use of ethically procured animal materials.  Early life  Brewer's parents, also artists, raised her in an environment centered around wildlife and family pets. Her art arose from an interest in biology and nature. She studied at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD), earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1993. During her formative years at MCAD she worked primarily with found objects, most of which were mummified animal remains. Her early works were shrines to the animals they incorporated and often involved the gold leafing of animal mummies, a technique still utilized in her current body of work. Her work with the remains of animals evolved into taxidermy over the years and she is self- taught in this realm. She states her work is an extension of her childhood belief in reincarnation and that her taxidermy sculptures serve as symbolic bodies for transmigrating animal spirits. She describes the art she has created throughout her career as an hommage to the animals she uses. Brewer is a conservationist and former wildlife rehabilitator who volunteered in the biology department at the Science Museum of Minnesota for over a decade.  Career  To form her own movement and break off from conventional taxidermy and its traditions, Brewer and two colleagues coined the term Rogue Taxidermy. In 2004, Brewer and two fellow Minneapolis artists established The Minnesota Association of Rogue Taxidermists (MART), an international collective of artists who use taxidermy-related materials (both organic and synthetic) as the common thread to unite their respective styles of mixed-media sculpture. The work of Brewer and the other founders of MART dramatically changed the way taxidermy materials are used. The pioneering work of Brewer and her fellow co- founders gained worldwide attention in 2005 after they appeared on the front page of the New York Times art section following their inaugural gallery exhibition. The article featured Brewer's taxidermy sculpture titled Goth Griffin. Positive response from other artists following the exhibition led to the formation of the collective. Public interest in the genre gave rise to an art movement. Taxidermy art (a term used interchangeably with Rogue Taxidermy) is a trend that started in Minnesota with the work of Brewer and fellow MART co-founders and now has an international following. An influx of people working within the genre has led to a taxidermy revival in recent years. Brewer maintains an ethical stance against traditional taxidermy culture. She does not kill animals for the purpose of creating art and she is noted as a trendsetter in this arena. Her work is made from recycled animal components salvaged from ethical sources such as natural deaths and road kill. She brought this policy with her when she helped construct MART. Brewer and her fellow co-founders incorporated this precept into the group's ethics charter, to which members of the collective were required to adhere. MART's \\"no-harm- no-waste\\" approach was one of the genre's founding elements and the use of ethically sourced materials has since become a tenet associated with the art movement and broadened the art form to appeal to people who previously opposed taxidermy for moral reasons. Brewer is regarded as an influential figure within the genre which has been noted for being largely female-driven, and she is acknowledged for playing a role in the shaping of it aesthetically as well as ethically. She has exhibited across the United States and has received international recognition. Her work has been included in Midwestern, West Coast, East Coast, and European venues.

He is the founder and CTO of Gemini Composites, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Chemical Carbon Fiber and Composites, and founder and former Director of the Automobili Lamborghini Advanced Composite Structures Laboratory (ACSL). He is known for having invented the Forged Composite technology, and his contributions to the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento and Aventador programs.  Life  Paolo Feraboli was born and grew up in Bologna, Italy. He graduated in mechanical engineering at the University of Bologna in 2002 with a Master's thesis on turbulent heat transfer. He received his doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2005 with a dissertation on impact of carbon fiber composite structures under the guidance of Professor Keith T. Kedward. Among his mentors during his doctoral studies were composite pioneers such as John Halpin of Air Force Research Laboratory, and Larry Ilcewicz of the Federal Aviation Administration.  Career  = Lamborghini = The relationship between Feraboli and Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. started in 2001‚Äì2002 with an internship at the Esperienza Compositi (R&D; composites division) at the headquarters in Sant'Agata Bolognese. Under the supervision of Attilio Masini, Andrea Bonfatti, and Maurizio Reggiani, Feraboli worked on the development of the Murci√©lago and Murci√©lago Roadster carbon fiber components in the body and chassis. After years of study and research in the United States, Lamborghini engaged Feraboli in 2007 to spearhead the development of new carbon fiber technologies as well as monocoque and chassis concepts while he was serving as Assistant Professor at the University of Washington. The successful collaboration led to the formal establishment of the Lamborghini Lab which was located on the UW campus from 2009 until 2013. After inventing Forged Composite technology for Lamborghini, Feraboli left the University in 2014 to focus on its further commercialization for the Italian car manufacturer. In order to do so, he opened a new stand-alone Lamborghini Lab which was to be the only Lamborghini R&D; organization outside of the headquarters in Italy. The new facility, inaugurated in 2016, included the Carbon Fiber Technology Gallery and Lamborghini Academy of Carbon Arts & Sciences. The legacy of Paolo Feraboli with Lamborghini is notable in the following achievements: *Aventador monocoque design and crash certification (homologation) using the aerospace- derived Building Block Approach *Aventador liquid resin infusion materials and processes used for the entirely out-of-autoclave monocoque *Aventador repair strategy including the \\"Flying Doctors\\" for carbon fiber composite repair *Sesto Elemento monocoque design, materials, and processes *Sesto Elemento Forged Composite suspension arms *Aventador Forged Composite connecting rod prototypes *The new marbled look of carbon fiber (the so-called \\"Forged Composite look\\") introduced first on the Sesto Elemento, then applied to the interior and exterior of the Aventador J, Veneno, Huracan, and Huracan Performante *Creation of novel test procedures for chopped carbon fiber composites *Pioneering use of 3D printing technology to make both artistic and engineering scale models *Highly acclaimed special series of scale models, Collezione Tecnica = Aerospace = Feraboli was introduced to the world of carbon fiber in aerospace by one of the founding fathers of composite technologies, his UCSB doctoral advisor Professor Keith Kedward. Professor Kedward was a fellow of AIAA, fellow of American Society of Composites (ASC), winner of the prestigious AIAA-ASC Starnes Award. Feraboli's research on aircraft foreign object damage (FOD) brought him to the NASA Langley Research Center in 2004‚Äì2005. There he conducted experiments and analysis on impact damage on carbon fiber structures for the blended wing body project, along with other projects in the Mechanics and Durability branch. In 2005, Feraboli was hired by the University of Washington to expand the recently established Boeing/FAA Center of Excellence for composites research, guided by the FAA Chief Scientist for Composites Dr. Larry Ilcewicz. In his new laboratory, Feraboli pioneered the first research in the public domain in chopped carbon fiber technology for commercial transport aircraft, lightning strike damage on composites, and composite crashworthiness. Because of his contributions in these fields, he received awards from the Japan Society for Composite Materials (JSCM), American Society for Composites (ASC), and MIL-17. While a professor at UW, Feraboli also worked in the Boeing 787 Technology Integration team in Everett, WA under Dr. Alan Miller and Dr. Patrick Stickler. Within this group, he conducted a critical review of all 787 composite analysis methods, including in-house tools and external software, and acted as the liaison with the Structural Methods and Allowables group, under William Sheridan. Feraboli is the founder and former chairman (2004-2012) of the Working Group on Composite Crashworthiness of the CMH-17 (formerly MIL- HDBK-17), the long established DoD/DoT organization aimed at providing recommendations on the use of composite materials. Ever since his Boeing and FAA experience, Feraboli has been a strong advocate for the Building Block Approach, also known as Certification by Analysis supported by test evidence. He has often spoken publicly to caution on the use of so-called predictive analysis tools for composites, especially in the area of crashworthiness. = Gemini Composites, LLC = In 2012 Feraboli incorporated a design and engineering firm called Gemini Composites, which focused on the commercialization of Forged Composite technology. Such breakthrough technology requires specific know-how in material, process, and design alike, and Gemini offered these services for OEMs worldwide and across multiple industries. At Gemini, Feraboli assisted OEMs in the development of several consumer goods, including: *The Callaway Golf Diablo Octane and Razr Hawk golf club heads *The Union Binding Company FC and Ultra snowboard bindings, which won the prestigious 2014 ISPO Product of the year award *Several global and regional patents for mountain bikes and lacrosse heads Gemini Composites supported several other OEMs in developmental and research projects, including Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Toyota, Ducati, Volvo, Honda North America, and Nike. In March 2017, Gemini Composites was acquired by Mitsubishi Rayon Co. (now Mitsubishi Chemical), to expand the use of Forged Composite technology under the new name Forged Molding Compound (FMC). In 2017, Toyota introduced a version of Forged Composite technology in the production of the Prius prime (PHV). The inner structure of the rear hatch is the first carbon fiber component used in a mass-produced vehicle thanks to the unique benefits of the new FMC technology. Mitsubishi Chemical, supplier of the Prius FMC material, is now the world's largest producer of Forged composite raw material worldwide. Since 2017, Feraboli supports Mitsubishi Chemical by leading the Global Engineering team, which is spread between Japan, USA, and Europe, and is tasked with the development of material property data and FEA analysis method generation for carbon fiber technology. Awards  For his contributions in the field of carbon fiber composites, Paolo Feraboli has received awards from the American Society for Composites, the Japan Society for Composite Materials, and the MIL-HDBK-17. He also holds an honorary research professor position at the Nagoya Institute of Technology in Japan.

He was a member of the Chaulukya (also called Chalukya or Solanki) Rajput dynasty. During his reign, the dynasty's power declined greatly as a result of rebellions by the feudatories as well as external invasions by the Ghurids, the Paramaras, and the Yadavas of Devagiri. The kingdom, however, was saved by his generals Arnoraja, Lavanaprasada and Viradhavala, whose family established the Vaghela dynasty.  Early life  Bhima II was a son of the Chaulukya king Ajayapala. He succeeded his brother Mularaja II at a young age. Taking advantage of his young age, some of his mandalikas (provincial governors) rebelled against him in order to establish independent states. His loyal feudatory Arnoraja came to his rescue, and died fighting the rebels. Arnoraja's descendants Lavanaprasada and Viradhavala became powerful during Bhima's reign, and ultimately established the sovereign Vaghela dynasty.  Conflicts  = Hoysalas = The Hoysala inscriptions claim that Veera Ballala II defeated the Gurjara king (that is, Bhima), who had allied with other kings to unsuccessfully attack him. However, the historical accuracy of this claim is doubtful. It is possible that the Hoysalas raided the Lata region in the Chaulukya territory. = Yadavas of Devagiri: Bhillama = The Yadavas of Devagiri invaded Gujarat during Bhima's reign. The 1189 CE Mutgi inscription of the Yadava king Bhillama V states that he defeated the Gurjaras (that is, Chaulukyas of Gujarat). The Sundha Hill inscription states that Bhillama was defeated by the Naddula Chahamana ruler Kelhana, who was the northern feudatory of Bhima. It is possible that Bhillama advanced up to the Naddula kingdom after defeating Bhima. Another possibility is that Kelhana marched southwards in Bhima's support. = Chahamanas of Shakambhari = During Bhima's reign, the Chaulukyas also had to fight with the Shakambhari Chahamana king Prithviraja III. The legendary text Prithviraj Raso states that these kings fought two battles, one near Nagaur, and another near Mount Abu. According to the 14th century chronicler Merutunga, Bhima's general Jagaddeva Pratihara was defeated in a battle against Prithviraja. A later recension of Prithviraja Raso contains an inaccurate legend, according to which Bhima killed Prithviraja's father Someshvara, and Prithviraja later killed Bhima. This cannot be correct, because Bhima lived for nearly half a century after Prithviraja's death. The Chahamanas and the Chalukyas appear to have concluded a peace treaty sometime before 1187 CE. According to the Kharatara-gachchha Pattavali, that year, Bhima's general Jagaddeva warned a chief named Abhayadeva not to harass pilgrims from Sapadalaksha (the Chahamana territory). He told the chief that he had just concluded a peace treaty with Prithviraja, with great difficulty. = Ghurids = In 1178 CE, the Ghurid king Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chaulukya kingdom, but was defeated. This battle took place during the reign of Bhima's predecessor Mularaja II, although some Muslim chronicles wrongly assign it to Bhima's reign. In the mid-1190s CE, the Ghurids defeated the Chahamanas and other Hindu kings of northern India. According to the medieval Muslim historians, in 1197 CE, the Ghurid general Qutb al-Din Aibak marched to Nahrwala (that is, the Chalukya capital Anahilapataka). He defeated the Chaulukya army on 4 February 1197 CE. The 13th century Muslim historian Hasan Nizami boasts that the Chaulukyas lost 50,000 men in this battle. The 16th century chronicler Firishta gives the numbers as 15,000 killed and 20,000 captured. According to the Muslim chronicles, the Chaulukya army was led by Rai Karan, Wallan and Darabaras in this battle. Darabaras can be identified with Dharavarsha, the Paramara chief of Abu, who was a feudatory of Bhima. Wallan is probably a corruption of Pahlan, which itself is a corruption of Prahaladana (the brother of Dharavarsha). The identification of Rai Karan is not certain. Some scholars have identified him with Kirtipala, a ruler of the Javalipura Chahamana branch. However, this identification is not tenable on chronological grounds. D. R. Bhandarkar identified Rai Karan as the Naddula Chahamana ruler Kelhana, but this is also chronologically incorrect, as Kelhana died around 1193 CE. R. B. Singh identified him as Kelhana's successor Jayatasimha. According to the Muslim historians, Rai Karan managed to escape after the battle. The Ghurids then entered Anahilapataka, and plundered the town. This sacking of Anahliapataka was witnessed by the Jain scholar Jinapati Suri in 1197 CE. According to Firishta, Qutb al-Din appointed a governor in the Chaulukya capital before leaving for Ajmer. Subsequently, the Chaulukyas restored their power in Gujarat, but there is very little information about how this happened. There are some references to Bhima's generals Lavanaprasada and Shridhara having achieved military successes against the Ghurids (called \\"Turushka\\" and \\"Hammira\\"). It is known that Bhima was in control of Anahilapataka by 1201 CE. = Paramaras: Subhatavarman = The Paramaras of Malwa, who had once lost their kingdom to the Chaulukyas, had managed to regain their power by the end of the 12th century. Meanwhile, the Chaulukyas had been weakened by the Ghurid attacks. Taking advantage of this situation, the Paramara king Subhatavarman successfully invaded the Lata region around 1204 CE. He probably also sacked the Chaulukya capital Anahilapataka. The 14th century writer Merutunga claims that the Paramara king retreated from the Gujarat border after Bhima's minister recited a verse warning him of reprisals. But this is not supported by historical evidence. According to the Gujarat chronicles, Subhatavarman occupied Darbhavati (present-day Dabhoi) for some time. Muhammad Aufi, in his Jawami ul-Hikayat, states that the Paramara king plundered cities of Gujarat, and destroyed Hindu temples as well as mosques. Subhatavarman is believed to have destroyed a mosque in Khambat, built for the Arab traders. According to the poet Arisimha, he also removed the gold pitchers from the Vaidyanatha temple of Darbhavati. The Chaulukya general Shridhara repulsed Subhatavarman's attack. His Devapattana prashasti inscription suggests that he successfully defended his fort (near Somnath) against a Paramara siege. The Chaulukya general Lavanaprasada probably forced Subhatavarman to abandon his campaign. His Dabhoi prashasti inscription, composed by the poet Someshvara, states that he was like a repository of medicine against the disease-resembling invaders, which included the ruler of Dhara (the Paramara capital). Another poet Balachandra names Lavanaprasada's adversary as Sribhata of Malwa, who has been identified as Subhatavarman. = Usurpation by Jayantasimha = Sometime during 1205-1210 CE, an usurper named Jayanta-Simha (Jayasimha) occupied Bhima's capital, Anahilapataka. Bhima managed to drive him out only during 1223-1226 CE. Jayantasimha was a part of the Chaulukya family, and traced his ancestry to the dynasty's founder Mularaja. = Paramaras: Arjunavarman = The usurper Jayanta-Simha was defeated by Arjunavarman, the son and successor of Subhatavarman. Like his father, Arjunavarman also invaded Gujarat sometime before 1211 CE. Merutunga calls him the \\"destroyer of Gujarat\\". A Bhopal inscription indicates that he had reached Bharuch by 1213 CE. The Dhar prashasti inscription states that he defeated Jayanta-Simha in the Parva mountain valley (possibly Pavagadh). It also states that Arjuna captured Jayanta's daughter Jayashri, and fell in love with her. According to historian A. K. Majumdar, this suggests that Jayanta made peace with the Paramaras through a marriage alliance. = Yadavas of Devagiri: Simhana = The Lata (southern Gujarat) region was repeatedly attacked by the Paramaras and the Yadavas of Devagiri during Bhima's reign. It came under the control of a chief named Simha, who was initially allied to the Paramaras. A 1200 CE inscription of the Yadava king Jaitugi states that he defeated the Gurjaras, which probably refers to his invasion of Lata. The Paramaras abandoned Simha during the Yadava invasion, so he turned to the Chaulukyas for help. During his 1213 CE invasion, the Paramara king Arjunavarman may have replaced Simha with the latter's nephew Shankha (alias Sangrama-Simha). Shankha repulsed a Yadava invasion of the region. Jaitugi's son Simhana invaded Gujarat multiple times. In an inscription, his general Kholeshvara claims to have humbled the pride of the Gurjaras. The first invasion of Simhana probably took place around 1229 CE. According to the Chaulukya accounts, Lavanaprasada concluded a peace treaty with Simhana, because he needed to visit Marwar to quell a rebellion. It appears that Lavanaprasada sent an army under his son Viradhavala to raid the Yadava territory, because of which Simhana was forced to agree to a peace treaty. After Lavanaprasada departed to Marwar, Shankha attacked Khambhat, but was defeated by the Chaulukya general Vastupala. Shankha then tried to instigate Simhana to launch a fresh attack on Gujarat. According to the Chaulukya accounts, the Chaulukya spies created a rift between the Shankha and Simhana. Shankha ultimately submitted to the Chaulukya general Viradhavala. The Chaulukyas were in control of the Lata region by 1231-1232 CE, when it was being governed by Lavanaprasada's grandson Visaladeva. Around 1237 CE, Simhana sent another army under Kholeshvara's son Rama to attack Gujarat. Visaladeva repulsed this attack, and Rama was killed in a battle fought on the banks of the Narmada river. = Rebellion in the north = The Chaulukya feudatories in the northern region of Marwar rebelled twice during Bhima's reign, and both times, Bhima's army was facing the Yadava invasions from the south. The first rebellion involved four feudatories, who were subdued by Lavanaprasada and Viradhavala. The second rebellion involved three feudatories: Udayasimha (probably Udayasimha, the Chahamana chief of Javalipura), Somasimha and Dharavarsha (Paramara chief of Abu). The Guhilas of Medapata (Guhilots of Mewar) also rebelled against Bhima sometime between 1207-1227 CE, and declared their independence. = Pithadeva's invasion of Kutch = According to the medieval text Jagadu-Charita, Pithadeva of Para invaded the Kutch region during Bhima's reign. A merchant named Jagadu sought help from Lavanaprasada, who dispatched an army that defeated Pithadeva. The identity of Pithadeva is not certain, but he was probably a Soomra ruler of Nagarparkar, who is variously called Pithu, Pahtu or Phatu by the Muslim chroniclers.  Personal life  Two queens of Bhima are known: Liladevi and Sumaladevi. Liladevi was the daughter of Samara-Simha, the Chahamana ruler of Javalipura, as attested by the 1205 Kadi inscription. According to the medieval chronicles, Bhima was a charitable person. He assumed the titles Abhinava-Siddharaja, Saptama- Chakravarti and Bala-Narayana.

According to two inscriptions, he built a mandapa called Meghanada or Meghadhvani in front of Somnath in 1217 CE. The temples of Bhimeshwara and Lileshwara were built by him in 1207 CE for the merits of his queen Lilavati at Lilapura, a town founded after her name. Lavanaprasada founded Salakshanapura, named after her mother, in Gambhuta district and built Analeshwara and Salakshaneshwara temples. His other queen Sumaladevi, daughter of Lavanaprasada, also built Sumaleshwara sometime before 1239 CE according to the Chusadi grant. Prahladana, brother of Paramara Dharavarsha of Abu, founded Prahladanapur (Palanpur) in 1218 and built Prahladana-vihara dedicated to Pallaviya Parshwanatha. Tripurantaka, a Shaivaite abbot built five temples at Somnath. The extant temples of his period include Nilkantha Mahadeva Temple (1204 CE) at Miani, Harshad Mata temple on the hill opposite creek near Miani, the temple complex of Muladwarka at Visavada. The Navlakha Temple of Ghumli is the best surviving example. Other temples include Rama Lakshamana Temple at Baradia in Okhamandal, Rukmini Temple in Dwarka and the ruined Shiva temple of Bavka in Dahod district. The mandapa was added to Vaidyanath Mahadeva temple at Vadali. The surviving mandapa of Parshwanatha temple at Ghumli is contemporary of Navlakha Temple. The ruined Cheleshwar temple on the hills there is also of this period. The Vikia and Jetha stepwells near Navlakha Temple, Ghumli belonged to the 13th century. The Gyan stepwell near Visavada village in the Barda hills is ascribed to the time of Bhima II. The ruined stepwell of nearby Keshav village is of the same period.  Last days  Bhima's general Lavanaprasada and his son Viradhavala established the Vaghela dynasty, which replaced the Chaulukyas in Gujarat some years after Bhima's death. According to the poet Someshvara, the goddess Gurjara-raja-lakshmi appeared in Lavanaprasada's dream, and ordered him to save the kingdom that had been decaying under the inexperienced king Bhima. Someshvara himself convinced Lavanaprasada to obey the divine order to save his motherland. Another poet Arisimha claims that the deceased Chaulukya king Kumarapala appeared in Bhima's dream, and advised the young king to appoint Lavanaprasada as Sarveshvara (chief lord) and Viradhavala as yuvaraja (heir apparent), in order to propagate the Jain faith. Yet another writer Udayaprabha claims that Bhima himself entrusted his kingdom to Lavanaprasada, because Lavanaprasada's father Arnoraja had made him the king by defeating the rebellious feudatories. Of all these writers, Someshvara was the most knowledgeable about the contemporary affairs. The \\"divine-order-in-a-dream\\" was a favourite device of the contemporary poets to justify the reprehensible actions of their patrons. Therefore, it appears that Lavanaprasada usurped the power from Bhima. By 1231 CE (1288 VS), Lavanaprasada had assumed the title Maharajadhiraja (\\"king of great kings\\") and Viradhavala was called a Maharaja (\\"great king\\"), as attested by multiple Girnar inscriptions. However, the two continued to nominally acknowledge Bhima (and his successor Tribhuvanapala) as their overlord.

It is written and co-produced by Joshua Conkel. The film was nominated for the Best Narrative Short award in the Tribeca Film Festival. It was also selected as Vimeo's first official Staff Pick.  Plot summary  Ralph, a foul-mouthed elderly man living in a Brooklyn assisted living facility attended to by Daniela, is visited by his granddaughter, Robin. The two discuss family matters and someone named \\"Jackie\\" until Robin inquires if Ralph loved his late wife (Robin's grandmother). Ralph reveals that, although he was fond of his wife, he had never truly fallen in love until now. He is then visited by Brent, Jackie's grandson, who had brought his grandfather along, revealed to be another foul-mouthed old man who happens to be Ralph's lover (in a wheelchair), astonishing Ralph. The couple bemoan the fact that they live separately and briefly get into an argument. Jackie eventually gets Brent and Ralph to slow dance together in lieu of himself (as he is recovering from hip surgery), savouring the moment. Robin and Daniela join in, also dancing together. Jackie abruptly stops the music and proposes to Ralph. The entire visit is revealed to have been a plan by the four of them. Ralph, overcome with disbelief and emotion, embraces Jackie and accepts his proposal.  Cast  * David Margulies as Ralph Pajovic * Danny DeVito as Jackie * Lucy DeVito as Robin * Sarah Nina Hayon as Daniela * Kett Turton as Brent  Production  In 2012, DeVito and his daughter, Lucy, watched a one- act play at the Ensemble Studio Theatre in Manhattan, New York, where Lucy worked. The play was written by Conkel, and starred Margulies as Ralph. Lucy suggested that it be turned into a film, and in the summer of 2015, asked Conkel if he wished to write the screenplay for the film, which he did. DeVito took up the mantle of director, while Jake and Lucy took the job of producer. The film was shot over the span of three days in a Brooklyn senior home. Margulies died in January 2016, a few months before the film's release.  Reception  The film was received well by critics. Collin Souter, writing for RogerEbert.com, praised the film, describing it as \\"very funny, romantic and one of the most heartfelt short films you‚Äôll ever see.\\" Jeffrey Bowers, from Vimeo Blog, noted that the film had a \\"decidedly un-Hollywood vibe,\\" in part due to it being a \\"labor of love and a family affair.\\" Curmudgeons was also chosen to be the first Vimeo Staff Pick Premiere.

It is composed of representatives of the People's Liberation Army Ground Force, Navy, and Air Force. Soldiers in the battalion must be at least 192 cm tall. This honor guard battalion, while reporting directly to the Central Military Commission, falls under the operational control of the Central Theater Command. During parades, the battalion is led by a color guard detail bearing the PLA flag, a tradition which began in 1981.http://www.xinhuanet.com//mil/2015-07/22/c_128047412_2.htm  History  From left to right: Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, George Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhu De inspecting the battalion in 1946 The enlarged honour guard in 1972. In 1946, the first Chinese ceremonial unit was formed in Yan‚Äôan to welcome the visit of General George Marshall, the special envoy of US President Harry Truman. The 500-member honor guard was commissioned by Eighth Route Army Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and rehearsed the day before the visit at Yan'an Airport. The unit would later serve under the newly formed PRC as Mao Zedong's protocol unit for the presentation of credentials. On 16 October, 16 days after the Proclamation of the People's Republic of China, members of the unit provided honors to incoming Soviet ambassador Nikolai Roszczin. In June 1953, Premier Zhou Enlai ordered to create an official battalion on the unit's basis. Around that same time, the battalion was tasked with guarding the Korean War negotiations. In its early stages, it was based in Yilong Camp and only conducted small arrival ceremonies such as the one for Indonesian President Sukarno in 1956 and North Korean leader Kim il-Sung and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1959. In 1956, the battalion became a tri-service unit and in September 1957, Premier Zhou personally changed the report of the guard commander to: \\"Comrade (states title of leader)\\", the Honor Guard of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has lined up for your inspection\\", which is still used today. One of its first major state visits that the battalion was tasked with its presence was the Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China, which set the precedent for PLA protocol on state visits. The battalion was given the responsibility in May 1977 to raise the national flag on Tiananmen Square. This was among its list of duties until December 1982. In September 1983, it was renamed to the Honor Guard of the 1st Guard Division of the People's Liberation Army. In January 1986, with the approval of the Beijing Military Region headquarters, the unit was renamed for the final time to its current name. On 2 March 1992, Jiang Zemin, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, signed an order to award the honorary title of the \\"Jiangsu Model of the Yilong Brigade\\" to the battalion.‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëËß£ÊîæÂÜõ‰∏âÂÜõ‰ª™‰ªóÈòüÁ§ºÊúçÁöÑÂéÜÂè≤ÂèòËøÅ In December 2017, the BGHGB officially attached the Beijing Garrison Color Guard Company as part of the battalion, formerly under the People's Armed Police, which had been responsible for flag raising ceremonies for 35 years. =Female soldiers in the PLA Honor Guard= On May 13, 2015, 13 female Chinese soldiers who were added to the battalion made their debut during the welcoming ceremony for the President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov of Turkmenistan.http://m.scmp.com/news/china/article/1511230/theres-trooper-pla- honour-guards-skirts-and-boots-steal-spotlight-leaders?amp=1 Since then, female soldiers have stood shoulder to shoulder with their male counterparts in the battalion on state occasions and in parades. In June 2018, the battalion created a separate female detachment composed of 55 female honor guards from the PLA as a result of the reforms in the ceremony of military honours for foreign leaders. This detachment was first reviewed by Russian President, Vladimir Putin, Kyrgyz President, Sooronbay Jeenbekov, and Kazakh President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, during their visits to the capital that month.http://www.atimes.com/article/plas-female-guard-of-honor-introduced-in- beijing/amp/http://m.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/xhtml1/features/spotlight/1806/2376-1.htmhttp://www.atimes.com/article/plas- female-guard-of-honor-introduced-in-beijing/amp/  Mission  The battalion in the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade Its missions include: * Providing honours for high ranking national personalities and foreign dignitaries in their visits to the PRC (usually inside or at the forecourt of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing) * Participate in wreath laying ceremonies * Provide the color guard company for the national flag raising ceremonies at Tiananmen Square * Providing guards of honour for state funerals of high-ranking officials of the Party and the Republic, deceased veterans of the PLA and active duty servicemen and women killed in action =Notable events and activities related to the mission= It performs the Changing of the Guard on Tiananmen Square and the raising of the Flag of China as well (from 1977-1982 and starting 2018). It has also performed at social events such as the 2008 Summer Olympics 2010 Asian Games in and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics.

In April 2001, Gabonese Defense Minister and future President of Gabon Ali Bongo was invited to visit China. After reviewing the honor guard upon arrival, he proposed to his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian, that members of the battalion will go to Gabon to help set up and train professional ceremonial units in the Gabonese Armed Forces. In March 2003, after just under three years, the Ministry of National Defense agreed to Bongo's request and sent four officers led by Lieutenant Colonel Wang Yuanjing to Libreville by the end of November of that year, after which they stayed to train Gabonese troops for more than 6 months. This marked the first time that any member of the PLA Guard of Honor had trained a foreign ceremonial unit.http://en.people.cn/200405/21/eng20040521_143989.htmlhttp://www.gov.cn/misc/2009-09/29/content_1429235.htm It would later visit other countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Mauritania and Qatar train their honor guards as well as active duty soldiers for parades. During the annual National Day parade in Qatar in 2017, the soldiers on parade adopted the Chinese marching style which was the result of the training by members of the battalion. Similarly, during the parade of the Rwanda Defence Force in honor of the 25th anniversary of the end of the Rwandan genocide, Chinese-trained RDF soldiers marched in a goosestep style for the first time as well as shouted commands in Mandarin to which the soldiers respond with \\"One!

Several news reports as well as films have been focused on the battalion, with some news stations including ABC having done reports on it. China's Ceremonial Soldiers (‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰ª™‰ªóÂÖµ), a TV series premiered on CCTV in 2001 on National Day. The eight episode series was directed by Zeng Xiaoxin and stars soldiers Yan Fan, Pan Yaowu and Li Bentao. The show focuses on the history and style of the honor guards in the PLA, as well as the tough training regimen of the guards for their ceremonial duties. The miniseries was co-produced by the Arts Department of the PLA and CCTV.http://www.cctv.com/lm/177/1.html In July 2016, the unit launched a special report called Telling Stories of Powerful Armed Forces on state television.http://m.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/xhtml1/people/Crowd/1608/887-1.htm The battalion often holds Media Days, during which journalists have access to its training quarters.

In August 1949, at the preparatory meeting for the proclamation ceremony of the PRC, Chairman Mao proposed that a salute should be fired at the ceremony, which endorsed by the participants. According to international practice, the highest specification is a 21-gun salute, however, Mao proposed increase this to 28 as to commemorate the 28th anniversary of the birth of the Communist Party of China in 1949.ÂÜõÊä•Êñ∞Â™í‰ΩìÈÇÄÊÇ®Êé¢ËÆø‰∏âÂÜõ‰ª™‰ªóÈòüÔºöÁúãÈ£íÁàΩËã±ÂßøÁöÑÊºÇ‰∫Æ After the meeting, Mao asked Tang Yongjian, director of the Training Division of the North China Military Region to draft a description of the sound of the salute. Tang quickly submitted the report to Mao who signed it immediately. Gao Cunxin, commander of the special forces of the North China Military Region was tasked with dispatching 108 mountain light guns from Zhangjiakou, which were mainly mountain cannons seized from the Imperial Japanese Army and were converted to the ceremonial role. The salute was later referred to as the \\"first generation salute\\". After the official announcement of the PRC occurred at the founding ceremony, the telephone command: \\"Salute!\\" was given to signal the firing of the gun salute. On 13 June 1961, President Sukarno visited China on a second trip, during which the guns were sounded once again during the welcoming ceremony held at the airport at the request of the Indonesian government. On 1 August 1963, the Yilu Camp Salute Company (formally known as the People's Liberation Army Salute Company) was formally established in Nanyuan and was given the task of acting as a salute battery by Premier Zhou Enlai. Shortly after the start of the Cultural Revolution, the gun salutes stopped occurring. This practice was revived in March 1984 by the People's Armed Police as a separate unit from the original PLA unit and in December 2017, the two units merged to become the artillery salute battery of the PLA, which reports to the BGHGB headquarters. Today, the battery is armed with the Type 60 122 mm field gun converted to the ceremonial role. Ceremonial uniform A tri-service honor guard in their distinctive Type 07 uniforms. From its founding to 1955, the battalion did not have an official ceremonial uniform and just wore overcoats captured from the Japanese Army after World War II. From 1955, the battalion used Chinese made ceremonial uniforms for the first time. They would continue to use these uniforms until June 1, 1965, when they reverted to using regular infantry uniforms for the next 20 years. In 1987, Central Military Commission of China ordered a reform of army uniforms, ordering the battalion ceremonial uniforms once again,https://books.google.com/books?id=g3yNDAAAQBAJ&pg;=PT63&dq;=PLA+Band+uniform&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiDnaO- wZXlAhVUpZ4KHXwaA-YQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q;=PLA%20Band%20uniform&f;=false and on October 1, 1992, the battalion gained ceremonial sabres which it first used during the visit of President Nelson Mandela.http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-08/26/c_134558199.htm Today, the unit utilizes the pan-PLA Type 07 uniform.https://books.google.com/books?id=Y06bCwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA17&lpg;=PA17&dq;=guard+of+honor+of+the+pla+hong+kong+garrison&source;=bl&ots;=pBCf6Wc8o1&sig;=ACfU3U2RPVHQmstzLEGClQBnCIyHGk05NQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiHv4uaxr_lAhXQWhUIHTobDts4ChDoATAGegQICBAB#v=onepage&q;=guard%20of%20honor%20of%20the%20pla%20hong%20kong%20garrison&f;=false Gallery File:Chinese military honor guard.jpgAirmen during an arrival ceremony File:Chinese troops stand in formation.jpgSailors in the battalion as well as the commander stand at attention during Donald H.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two cream-coloured flowers which are smaller than those in subspecies bacalliata . Description Caladenia bicalliata subsp. cleistogama is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which occurs singly or in small clumps. It has a single erect, very hairy, linear to lance-shaped leaf, long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme, high with one or two flowers, each flower about long and wide. The dorsal sepal abruptly narrows about one-third of its length from the base. The lateral sepals and petals are much shorter than those of subspecies bicalliata, lack reddish-brown tips and are a paler greenish-cream colour. The labellum is white with red spots and a serrated edge and has two rows of white-tipped calli along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to early September, however the flowers only rarely open fully. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia bicalliata was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1909. In 2001 Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown described two subspecies, including subspecies cleistogama and the description of the two subspecies was published in Nuytsia.

He has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions, during his life and posthumously. Biography Henry Cady Wells was born in 1904 in Southbridge, Massachusetts, the son of Channing McGregory Wells, President of the American Optical Company and founder of Old Sturbridge Village. As a young man, he had years of classical training in music, literature and the arts. At first his interests led him to study music, training to become a concert pianist. Then he shifted to stage design, studying with Joseph Urban, and Norman Bel Geddes. He was afforded all the cultural and educational advantages that a child of a wealthy first generation New England Family could receive. Wells, who was homosexual, was the family rebel. He dropped out of five boarding schools and refused to fit into the plans of his conservative family. He discovered the Southwest when his father sent him to Evans Ranch School in Arizona in 1922. Wells fell in love with the desert and mountain landscapes and began painting them. In 1932, Wells recognized that his talent lay in the area of painting, which would become his career. He accepted an invitation from artist E Boyd and her husband Eugene Van Cleave to come to Santa Fe, New Mexico. There he began portraying the southwest landscapes in watercolors. He soon became a serious painter, working alongside Andrew Dasburg. He learned the landforms by walking and studying the mountains, mesas, and driftwood, and collecting river rocks. Wells was deeply influenced by Japanese and Chinese philosophies and aesthetics while he was in Japan (1935). His exhibitions were sometimes alongside the work of better known artists such as Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Adolph Gottlieb, and Jackson Pollack. In addition to Dasburg, he was influenced by Raymond Jonson, and Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe. His art career was interrupted when he entered into the United States Army in 1941, where he worked with topographic maps. He did not paint again until he returned to New Mexico in 1945. While living in Taos, Wells restored an old Spanish home at Jacona, some twenty miles north of Santa Fe, and there gained a reputation as a magnificent host. He was clever, witty, affectionate, and generous; he anonymously aided numerous individuals during the post-depression and war years. Many in the community sought him out as a guest and a friend. He made many friends, and soon became one of the social figures of Taos and Santa Fe. Wells was known for his love and contributions to Santa Fe. He served on the board of directors of Santa Fe's School for Advanced Research and helped found the Jonson Gallery in Albuquerque. He gave his collection of some 200 santos to the Museum of New Mexico in 1951, with the condition that a separate department be established for Spanish colonial art. He recommended his friend E Boyd for the job of curator. Wells died of a heart attack in Santa Fe in 1954, a few days shy of his fiftieth birthday.

Early life Born in 1932, McCamley's parents Edward and Ivy were second generation Polled Hereford cattle breeders, and had established a successful stud on their property Eulogie Park near Dululu, Queensland. McCamley grew up on the Dululu property with his siblings and learnt as much as he could about cattle. In 1947, McCamley fell from his horse while chasing after a bullock. He suffered injuries to his right leg after his horse landed on it in the fall. He was treated by ambulance officers from Wowan, Queensland before being taken to Rockhampton. McCamley was then flown to Brisbane for further treatment.Leg Fractured, The Morning Bulletin, 17 December 1947, retrieved 12 October 2016 As he became older, McCamley continued to show an interest in the quality of various cattle breeds. In 1948, he entered the Queensland Country Life Young Judges Competition at the Rockhampton Show, where he placed first after impressing the judge with his eye for detail on the points bulls needed to be considered high quality.Young Judges At Rockhampton, Queensland Country Life, 24 June 1948, retrieved 12 October 2016 Cattle Industry In 1954, McCamley travelled to the United States with his sister Mavis and another Queensland cattle grazier Clare Langmore. The trio spent three months touring the United States inspecting the quality of American cattle breeds. They visited the University of California and ranches in Kansas and Wyoming. Upon their return, the team were keen to relay their experiences and impressions about American cattle.American Cattle Are Too Small; High Prestige For Land Industries, Queensland Country Life, 11 February 1954, retrieved 12 October 2016Judging Rings Small, Cramped; Exhibitors Keen, Queensland Country Life,25 February 1954, retrieved 12 October 2016Photos from American tour, Queensland Country Life, 25 February 1954, retrieved 12 October 2016Letter: Uniform Herds, American Impressions, Graham McCamley, Queensland Country Life, 11 March 1954, retrieved 12 October 2016 Soon after marrying his wife, McCamley purchased \\"Tartrus\\" which was the start of the McCamley cattle empire.The McCamley cattle empire, Kathy Cogo, ABC Rural, 27 July 2006, retrieved 13 October 2016 McCamley eventually established Brahman herds on Tartrus Station, west of Marlborough, Queensland, namely the Tartrus Red and Grey Brahman breeds. However, McCamley claims it was only because he was tired of mustering Poll Herefords to treat for ticks that he decided to move into breeding Brahman cattle in 1958, although it was originally because he wanted to see what negative qualities Brahman cattle had. After beginning to receive quality returns for the Brahman breed, McCamley worked closely with the CSIRO to monitor the breeds for weight gain and fertility performance. The stud at Tartrus would go on to become recognised by CSIRO scientists for producing \\"super dams\\" - cows that would calve annually.Historic Tartrus Brahman herd reaches the end of the road, Jon Condon, Beef Central, 22 November 2013, retrieved 12 October 2016A simpler life for Sir Graham McCamley, Kathleen Calderwood, ABC Rural, 19 December 2013, retrieved 13 October 2013 McCamley eventually built up a considerable cattle empire in Central Queensland, encompassing the properties of Tartrus, Royles, Glenprairie, Oakleigh, Stoodleigh and Tanderra. McCamley was the first president of the Cattlemen's Union of Australia which was established in May 1975. Following the Cattlemen's Union's first national convention, held in Rockhampton, McCamley said the union had established itself as a force to be reckoned with when it came to representing the beef industry, despite critics forecasting a short life for the union. The three-day conference attracted more than 3000 members and observers from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and the Northern Territory.Cattlemen's Union 'force to be reckoned with', The Canberra Times, 6 December 1976, retrieved 12 October 2016 In 1977, McCamley responded angrily at blackmail allegations made by National Country Party MP, David Thomson who claimed executives from the Cattleman's Union had threatened him with voting for Australian Democrats candidates at the next Federal Election.Cattleman reacts angrily, The Canberra Times, 15 September 1977, retrieved 12 October 2016 McCamley led the Cattleman's Union of Australia until 1978.

While rounding up some stray cattle, he came off his motorbike and fell down a 15-metre embankment with the motorbike landing on top of him. With Bjelke-Petersen missing for hours, a large scale search was organised. Bjelke-Petersen had recently received a death threat, giving police some reason to believe he may have been kidnapped or met with foul play. Police contacted McCamley the night Bjelke-Petersen went missing to ask for assistance. McCamley immediately fuelled his private helicopter and left his property \\"Tartrus\\" at first light the following morning. In 2015, McCamley recalled how he spotted skid marks while he was flying his helicopter along a boundary fence, before locating Bjelke-Petersen's motorbike. Landing his helicopter, McCamley contacted the police to direct them to the scene. But despite locating the motorbike and some personal effects, Bjelke-Petersen was not found. McCamley then got back into his helicopter to continue searching. After a short time in the air, McCamley eventually located Bjelke-Petersen slumped over a log, slipping in and out of consciousness and again alerted the police to his location. Bjelke-Petersen had somehow walked to some cattle yards, despite being seriously injured. In the accident, he sustained a punctured lung, broken elbow, and broken ribs.

He produced a large volume of juvenile literature for boys, comics, crime fiction, and biographies, and he worked as a translator of children's and young adult fiction from English into Norwegian.Store norske leksikon: Arnold Jacoby. Personal life and family Jacoby was born and grew up in Brooklyn, where his aunt, her husband and two children also lived. His parents had emigrated to America, but the family moved back to Larvik when Jacoby's grandfather Georg Jacoby died and his nursery on Dronningensgate (Queen Street) stood empty without someone to take care of it. While still a young man, Jacoby moved to Oslo, where he made a living writing and producing advertising and illustrations. During the Second World War he moved to Ula, and later back to Larvik. In 1961, he bought an 800-year-old house in Andora, Italy, where he spent extensive time and worked. He was the father of Marianne Rosenblad Jacoby Steina, a translator, proofreader, and publishing editor at Fogdal Publishing, and editor at Bonnier A/S, the singer and writer Louis Jacoby, and the illustrator and graphic designer Tom Rosenblad Jacoby.Rust√∏y, Mari. No date. M√∏t Louis Jacoby i den vestfoldske skj√¶rg√•rden. Viser.no. He was married to Ellen n√©e Dahl (1918‚Äì2012). Arnold Jacoby died in Larvik. Career In 1941, the magazine Mystikk announced a competition to obtain Norwegian feature stories. Jacoby won the competition with his story \\"Mysteriet 'Robusta Gloria'\\" (The Mystery of Robusta Gloria), which was published in issue no. 11 (1942) under a pseudonym consisting of the author's two given names: Victor Arnold. The detective in the story was the \\"criminal agent\\" Herlofsen. Jacoby also wrote a feature story for Mystikk's Christmas issue that year, called \\"R√∏ntgenplatens hemmelighet\\" (The X-Ray Plate Secret), featuring the agent Erik Drag as the protagonist, and also the crime novel D√∏den annonserer ikke (Death Does Not Advertise). Because of the war, Jacoby wrote under several pseudonyms. The novel D√∏den og skipperen (Death and the Captain) was written under the name Sven (Tor) Winge, and the children's books Jon i verden (John in the World) and Krussedulle (Doodles) were written under the name Tone Silje. Jacoby translated nearly 200 children's books over a 50-year span, including series such as The Hardy Boys, the Bobbsey Twins, Twin Connection, Vicky Austin, Conny, Cherry, Honey Bunch, and others. He was an illustrator and had a drawing office in Oslo in the early part of the Second World War together with the brothers Trygve and Olav Mosebekk. He was responsible for several comics, including Atlantis in Norsk Ukeblad under the pseudonym Erik Glende.S√§tre, Trond. 2016. Eventyrets tidsalder. Sirenett.no (September 11). The comic Atlantis was launched in the fall of 1942 and ceased when Norsk Ukeblad was shut down by the Germans in the spring of 1943. The same year he produced the comic Cyklon-Kid (The Cyclone Kid) together with Trygve Mosebekk in the magazine Mystikk. This was published 17 times before it was also shut down by the Germans. The series was reworked after the war and was published under the name Sabotasjegjengen (The Sabotage Gang) in the revived magazine, now renamed Alle Menns Blad. During the war he also produced the comic Bimba - hele verdens lille venn (Bimba: The Whole World's Little Friend), which was published in a Christmas and Easter magazine for children. Jacoby was a close childhood friend of the adventurer and researcher Thor Heyerdahl,Evensberget, Snorre. 1994. Thor Heyerdahl: The Explorer. Oslo: J.M. Stenersens Forlag A/S, p. 166.Amara, A√Øcha. 2003. Safi & les odyss√©es de Thor Heyerdahl.

The two of them lived near each other in the municipality of Andora on the Ligurian coast in northern Italy. Jacoby's most influential book was Det ang√•r ogs√• deg (It Also Applies to You), which deals with Herman Sachnowitz's time as a prisoner at the Auschwitz concentration camp and was written in collaboration with him.

The 2016 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders ranked Bahrain 162nd out of 180 countries. Bahrain is a constitutional monarchy led by the Khalifa royal family. Criticized by numerous organizations for its censorship of information and repression of its people, it has become notorious for jailing journalists.  Constitutional laws regarding censorship  The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bahrain outlines freedoms of expression, press and telecommunications in Articles 23-26. Article 23 states that citizens are ‚Äúfree to express their opinion and publish it ‚Ä¶ provided it does not violate the fundamentals of the Islamic faith or the unity of the country and does not provoke sectarianism or communalism.‚Äù Constitution of the Kingdom of Bahrain. Articles 23 -26. Online:http://www.shura.bh/en/LegislativeResource/Constitution/Pages/Constitution03.aspx Article 24 claims that ‚Äúfreedom of press, printing and publishing is guaranteed.‚Äù Article 26 posits that ‚Äúfreedom to use postal correspondence, telegraph and telephone is guaranteed as also their secrecy. Correspondence will not be censored or its secrets revealed except in cases stated in law.‚Äù Many journalists argue that these clauses are open-ended and can be arbitrarily interpreted by Bahraini officials. Various sources claim that in practice these rights are not upheld.  Censored subjects  = Opposition = Since 2011, a surge of uprisings and demonstrations have taken place against the current regime, as part of the Arab Springs. This opposition to the government has been met with increased repression and harsher censoring measures for dissidents. One source states authorities ‚Äúhave held secret trials where protesters have been sentenced to death, arrested prominent mainstream opposition politicians, jailed nurses and doctors who treated injured protesters, seized the health care system that had been run primarily by Shiites, fired 1,000 Shiite professionals and canceled their pensions, detained students and teachers who took part in the protests, beat and arrested journalists, and forced the closure of the only opposition newspaper.‚Äù Other repressive tactics deployed by the government against opposing figures, activists and journalists include arrests, torture, and the revocation of one‚Äôs citizenship. = Other subjects = Aside from the repression of any anti-government sentiments, matters pertaining to human rights are heavily censored. Promotion of hatred, gambling or pornography are also banned from websites and media sources.  Censored outlets  = Press = All major newspaper outlets within Bahrain are heavily influenced by the government besides one. The only newspaper seen as outside the sway of the government is Al-Wasat, whose building headquarters was attacked by a crowd of pro-government supporters carrying knives and clubs. Pro-government media, on the other hand, have allegedly engaged in presenting misinformation. According to a report by Bahrain Watch, there have been 25 instances of misinformation between 2011 and 2014. Self-censorship occurs within the media, as many newspapers elect not to cover political or controversial subjects. The Press and Publication Law of 2002 has been strongly criticized as repressive. It prohibits any publications against the regime in power, averse to the state‚Äôs official religion, breaching ethics or jeopardizing public peace. Many Bahraini journalists argue that this language can be arbitrarily interpreted. = Internet = The government maintains control over the Internet by requiring all websites to register with the Information Affairs Authority (IAA). Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are indirectly controlled through the Telecommunications Regulation Authority (TRA) under the pretext of helping to protect intellectual property. A resolution issued by the Ministry of Culture and Information in January 2009 requires all ISPs to install a website blocking software chosen by the Ministry.Resolution No 1 of 2009, Ministry of Culture and Information, published in Official Gazette, Issue No.2877, dated 8 January 2009 The IAA and select Ministries within the government can decide to block certain websites, which is then enforced by the ISP. The IAA typically sites Articles 19 and 20 of Bahrain‚Äôs Press Laws and Regulations when blocking access to websites. According to the Article 19, ‚Äúit is possible to prohibit circulation of publications instigating hatred of the political regime, encroaching on the state‚Äôs official religion, [and] breaching ethics‚Ä¶‚Äù According to Reporters Without Borders, over 1,000 websites have been blocked or shut down. This includes human rights websites, blogs, online forums and social media pages.  Journalist arrests  Numerous journalists have been jailed under arbitrary causes, the arrests escalating during the uprisings of 2011. On August 31, 2014, photographer Ahmed Humaidan was condemned to 10 years in prison after covering the 2011 uprising, allegedly for attacking the police. Sayed Ahmed Al Mousawi, the winner of more than 100 international awards was arrested in February 2014 for ‚Äúdistributing SIM cards‚Äù to persons supposedly implicated in terrorist actions and photographing anti-government demonstrations. His ten-year jail sentence was upheld in court. Nabeel Rajab, a blogger who heads the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, was arrested without a warrant at his home on June 13, 2016. Reporters Without Borders and other organizations are campaigning for the release of imprisoned journalists.

The term is derived from the title of a 1963 book by Nicholas Zernov called, The Russian Religious Renaissance of the Twentieth Century. The renaissance began in the late nineteenth century but was unexpectedly driven out of Russia due to the violent upheavals of the Bolshevik Revolution and early atheistic Communist regimes. This dislocation led to the resettlement of many Russian intelligentsia in Europe and the West where the renaissance reached its full expression. Although often viewed as a development within the Russian Orthodox world, the spiritual ideals of the Russian Religious Renaissance were carried throughout the wider Orthodox Church and even into the Roman Catholic and Protestant communities. Philosophical origins Theologian Paul L. Gavrilyuk explains that the Russian Religious Renaissance was an attempt to interpret all aspects of human existence: culture, politics, even economics, in Christian terms.Gavrilyuk, Paul L., The Orthodox Renaissance, Article appearing on the website firstthings.com The philosophical origins of the Russian Religious Renaissance can be found in the main currents of nineteenth-century western European and Russian religious thought: German idealism especially Schelling, the existentialism of Kierkegaard, religious questions raised by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and the sophiology of Vladimir Solovyov. Solovyov's metaphysics of all unity stimulated an ontological turn in Russian religious thought and thinkers such as Sergius Bulgakov engaged and developed this theory extensively.Gavrilyuk, Paul L., Georges Florovsky and the Russian Religious Renaissance, page 17, Oxford University Press, 1st Edition The Paris School With the establishment of the St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute in Paris in 1925, Russian √©migr√© theologians, philosophers and historians began to create a diverse range of ideas and writing. The label \\"Paris School\\" has sometimes been applied collectively to the theology and religious philosophy of the founders of St. Sergius and other Russian √©migr√© intellectuals in Paris including Georges Florovsky, Vladimir Lossky, Sergius Bulgakov, Alexander Schmemann, Nicholas Lossky and Nicholas Berdyaev. This label must be nuanced however by pointing out that there were at least five theological strains among the so-called Paris School. Alfeyev, Bishop Hilarion, Orthodox Theology on the Threshold of the Twenty-First Century. Paper at the international scholarly conference \\"The Russian Orthodox Church from 1943 to the present\\" at the Transfiguration Monastery in Bose (Italy), 15-17 September 1999 It was during the early decades of St. Sergius that the Russian Religious Renaissance reached its apogee for Eastern Orthodox Theology. By 1950, the older generation of √©migr√©s had died (Bulgakov, Berdyaev and Shestov) so roughly this would mark the end of the renaissance. Several theologians from St. Sergius later became influential teachers in America. John Meyendorff and Georges Florovsky began at St. Sergius and later became professors at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary. Spirituality of the Russian Religious Renaissance In addition to the philosophic and theological aspects, the Russian Religious Renaissance included a resurgence of Russian spirituality and its introduction to the West. The spiritual aspect of the renaissance is associated with people such as Silouan the Athonite, Archimandrite Sophrony, Archbishop Anthony Bloom and Mother Maria Skobtsova.Nicholas Zernov, The Russian Religious Renaissance of the Twentieth Century Another notable Russian spiritual figure was Catherine Doherty (Ekaterina Fyodorovna Kolyschkine de Hueck Doherty) a Russian √©migr√© from the Bolshevik Revolution. Wild, Fr. Robert, Catherine Doherty and the Russian Religious Renaissance, Cause Newsletter #19 ‚Äî Fall 2011 Russian spirituality in Roman Catholicism The Russian Religious Renaissance extended beyond the Eastern Orthodox Church. Probably the most notable example is Catherine de Hueck Doherty, a Russian √©migr√© who escaped during the Bolshevik Revolution. She later became a convert to Roman Catholicism and founder of Madonna House, a lay apostolate based in Combermere Canada. Madonna House is a Roman Catholic institution which includes Eastern Rite liturgies and many aspects of Russian spirituality such as poustinia, sobornost and molchanie. Catherine Doherty sought to incarnate the Gospel in all aspects of Christian life and her vision included many of the ideals of Solovyov, especially the re-unification of East and West. Wild, Fr.

However, it was later decided that, to make the show more entertaining, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Gonzo would be added in. Jim Lewis was asked to provide consultation on the show's scripts.

It is a synthesis of the Shorin Ryu katas, Motobu Ryu two-person open hand grappling and weapons techniques, and kobudo katas mostly of the Ryukyu Kobudo lineages. History Shian Toma opened his dojo in 1960 teaching Shorin Ryu and Kobudo to the local populace and US Servicemen. Originally Shian Toma named his dojo Toma Dojo, but later the name was changed to Sei-Do-Kan Dojo. This translated to \\"True Way House/Style\\" or A House of the True Way. In the early 1960s Shian Toma's teachings were referred to as a style called Shorinji Ryu, and his dojo belonged to the Okinawa Kenpo Renmei under Shigeru Nakamura. In 1968 Shian Toma, Seikichi Uehara and Seiyu Oyata formed the Ryukyu Karate-do Renmei. Then in 1969 the dojo became an official member of the Motobu Undun Di society and the style came to be referred to as Seidokan Motobu Ryu, Toma was promoted by the 13th Soke of Motobu-Ryu, Seikichi Uehara, to 9th Dan Hanshi. Toma was the first person to introduce Motobu-Ryu outside of Okinawa, teaching in North American. The first student of Master Toma to bring Seidokan to the United States was John E. Kennedy who was promoted to 9th Dan by Grand Master Toma in 2001. He is the senior student of Grand Master Toma and continues to teach the true Seidokan in Spencerport, NY. His senior student is John LaMarca, 8th Dan and Chief of Instruction for Toma Karate Dojos in Spencerport and Ariona. After a separation from the Motobu Society in 1983, Shian Toma formed his own organization called the Zen Okinawa Seidokan Karate Kobudo. Toma's most prolific student was Col. Roy J. Hobbs, USAF Retired, who was President of the Seidokan Shihan Kai and the most senior student for many years before leaving to form his own association the Sekai Dentokan Budo Renmei, Inc. Within the Dentokan are taught three styles of Karate (Goju-Ryu, Shorin-Ryu, & Shito- Ryu), Okinawa Kobujutsu, Nihon Aikijujutsu, and Iaido (Morinaga Ha Toyama Ryu & Mugai Ryu).

A need to develop and organize Okinawa Seidokan's international efforts gave birth to the Ryukoku Seidokan Karate Kobudo Renmei (RSKKR) in 2008. This international headquarters is located at the Nix Seidokan Dojo, 5-20-24 Misato, Okinawa City, Okinawa-Ken, Japan 904-2153. Ron Nix is the International Ambassador and President of the RSKKR. Due to the passing of the headmaster Shian Toma in May 2013, the mantel passed to Shigemitsu Tamari of Yomitan Okinawa Japan to become the second headmaster of Okinawa Seidokan. The surviving Toma family officially retired the original organization \\"Zen Okinawa Seidokan Karate Kobudo Renmei\\" name. The first word 'Zen' was then dropped out of respect to the Toma Family wishes and Shigemitsu Tamaie formed the 'Okinawa Seidokan Karate Kobudo Renmei' (OSKKR) as the 'Honbu Dojo'. Shigemitsu Tamaie and Ron Nix travel out of Okinawa to teach seminars as well as host visiting karateka from all over the world to come to the heart of karate and train in the Okinawa Seidokan system. In 2016 C. Michial Jones, who was graded to Shihan by Shian Toma and to Kyoshi by Col. Roy J. Hobbs in Seidokan Karate and Kobudo, founded the International Karate Kobudo Kyokai to further the teachings of Shian Toma. The largest contingent of Seidokan practitioners, outside of Okinawa Japan, exist in the United States of America.

It operated as a seminary until 1985, after which it became a center for meetings and spiritual retreats for the people of the Hudson Valley in New York. In 2012, the Mount ceased operations and was leased to the Bruderhof Communities who use the building for their Mount Academy. History Upon the arrival of some Belgian Redemptorists in the United States in 1838, they began the mission work for which they had been established in Italy a century earlier by their founder, Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori, C.Ss.R., a bishop and noted spiritual writer, among the Native Americans who lived along the frontier of the young nation. By 1850, the nine Redemptorist communities in the United States were formed into the independent Province of Baltimore. A seminary was soon opened in Maryland for the training of the young candidates to the Congregation. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, it was felt by the Redemptorists that the locales they had chosen for their seminarians had not been healthful. In 1904, with financing by the family of Father Augustine Duper, C.Ss.R., a native of the Bronx, the decision was made to move the seminary to Esopus, where they had purchased a 235-acre property, which eventually grew to over 400 acres.Garber, Mary Ann. \\"Now-closed Mount St. Alphonsus has a storied history\\", The Criterion, Archdiocese of Indianapolis, November 30, 2012 The main portion of the building was designed by William Licking; the chapel was designed by Brother Max Monz, C.Ss.R. in Romanesque style. Upon completion of construction in 1907, theological studies began to be given at the seminary for the young men of the province. The school also served as a locale for many activities of the local Catholic population. Additionally, the faculty provided spiritual care to their neighbors at a mission chapel in the town, as well as assisting the Church of the Presentation parish in neighboring Port Ewen, and Sacred Heart Church in Esopus. They oversaw, as well, a small cloistered monastery of Redemptoristine nuns located on the grounds. In 1985, due to the declining numbers of students, the decision was made by the province to relocate their seminarians to study at the Washington Theological Union in Washington, D.C.. The seminary building was then refashioned into a retreat center, serving people in the greater New York area, New Jersey and Connecticut. It was also a popular site for weddings due to the beauty of the grounds. By the time the seminary closed, some 1,300 Redemptorist seminarians had been ordained as Catholic priests there. Because of their aging membership, in 2011 the leaders of the province determined they could no longer maintain the Mount and the entirely facility would have to be closed. It was felt that this would free them to continue their primary ministry to the poor and most abandoned. The Mount Seminary then closed as of January 1, 2012. In May 2012, the property was leased by the Bruderhof community, that is currently using it as a community location that houses its Mount Academy high school for the young of their religious community. The chapel has been left intact. Notable alumni * Rev. John A.

He was best known for collaborative works with neurologists Jacob Chandy, Balasubramaniam Ramamurthi and Baldev Singh and together they have been credited to be pioneers in development of epilepsy surgery in India. They also helped in establishing the Neurological Society of India in 1951 at Madras.  Life  Not much is known about the life of Narasimhan; but Balasubramaniam Ramamurthi's biography Uphill All The Way gives some details. Narasimhan was born in 1913, and around 1945 he sold his medical practice in India so he could go to the United States of America to further his studies. He was a General Surgeon and at the Neurological Institute of New York he trained in neurology and neurosurgery. He returned to India in 1948 and started his private practice setting up a neurosurgical nursing home and EEG laboratory and stayed in the residential areas of Kilpauk, Chennai. Dr. Balasubramaniam had set up the Department of Neurosurgery at the Government General Hospital, Chennai in 1950 and Narasimhan joined him as an honorary assistant surgeon. During the pioneering days, X-rays and EEG were used in diagnosis as angiography was not yet available in India. During the neurosurgical procedures that Balasubramaniam under took, Narasimhan assisted him in EEG service and in later patient care. Narasimhan earned around for each procedure from the then Government of Madras. In 1951, Singh, Chandy, Ramamurthi and Narasimhan established the Neurological Society of India and together find credit as pioneers of epilepsy surgery in India.

The initiative was founded by Kirthi Jayakumar in Chennai, India, on June 5, 2013. On June 4, 2017, The Red Elephant Foundation was recommended by Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations, for Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council.  Activities  The Red Elephant Foundation's activities are chunked down into five key blocks: = Storytelling = In the long term, the initiative aims at shifting mindsets and pivot people naturally towards equality, peace and non-violence. The storytelling wing curates stories of survivors, change-makers and peace-workers around the world so that these stories inspire action, empathy and awareness of the world. The foundation has told stories of several activists, changemakers and survivors, including Maya Azucena, Zak Ebrahim, Kamla Bhasin, Tabish Khair and Vaishnavi Sundar among others. = ChalkPeace = The foundation makes its stories actionable by building curriculums to address issues of gender inequality, violence in communication and action, and to address the need for sensitization around gender based violence. These curriculums are tailor-made to suit each demographic's needs, and are then used to conduct training sessions at schools, colleges, community groups and work places. The foundation's education programs are curated on their platform, called ChalkPeace. The ChalkPeace Program has re-created versions of board games to teach values of Gender Equality and Peace, such as: Snakes and Ladders, Guess Who, Pictionary, Taboo and Memory. = Tech For Good = While the goals of storytelling and education/sensitization are couched in the long-term, the initiative focuses on the imminent need for assistance, sensitized help and qualitative support for survivors of violence. This encouraged the birth of an online tech-based tool that maps organizations providing legal, medical, resource, education/employment help and police, ambulance and consular services across 196 countries in the world, called the GBV Help Map. They also curate stories of online abuse through the Troll Register and school and college level bullying through Report a Bully. The Youth Solutions Report by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network features The Red Elephant Foundation's #GBVHelpMap as one of the top 50 solutions / ideas in the world to achieve #SDG5 on #GenderEquality, and has also specifically been curated as a Case Study on \\"The Era of Digital Accountability.\\" The organization created Saahas, a mobile app version of the GBV Help Map. The app was coded by Kirthi Jayakumar. = The Building Peace Project = The Building Peace Project is an, intensive online program spread over eight weeks. Participants from all over the world will be engaged in sessions facilitated by trained facilitators using a curriculum grounded in values of peace education, dialogue, writing and some dynamic thinking. Although based on a curriculum, the sessions give participants room, autonomy and encouragement to explore their spontaneity creatively. = Digital Advocacy = The initiative runs digital media campaigns that serve a two-pronged strategy: online stakeholding and awareness, and offline dialogue building and exchange. Some campaigns include: More than my Body and Break a Gender Stereotype. We also participate in the 16 Days of Activism against VAW and He For She. The Break a Gender Stereotype Campaign was awarded by Femvertising in 2016 with the People's Choice Award. The initiative has also collaborated with and supported other organizations on their campaigns, including one to fight the normalization of stalking in Indian cinema. They also supported the United Nations in its MyWorld Campaign through the collection of votes using online advocacy. The initiative partnered with the US Consulate at Chennai for its Pride Month event in 2016. They also supported the Her Story Wikipedia Editathon campaign in August 2016. The team also represented as part of the Civil Society Committee Members in choosing questions from the civil society to ask candidates standing for the office of the UN Secretary General. In addition, the initiative has also successfully undertaken research to inform its work. Offline, the foundation has supported disaster response through aid dispensation and support for different communities during the Nepal earthquake, the Manipur earthquake, and the floods in Chennai.  Awards  The Red Elephant Foundation won the Femvertising in 2016 with the People's Choice Award for its campaign called Breaking Gender Stereotypes. They were also finalists in the Social Media for Empowerment Awards 2017, in the Women's Empowerment category. They were finalists in the Early Stage Innovation Category for the mBillionth Awards 2017 for their mobile app, Saahas. The Red Elephant Foundation was awarded the Outstanding NGO Award by FICCI FLO at Chennai in February 2018. They also won the UN Online Volunteering Award, 2017.

Life Leonardo Cremonini was the son of a railway worker who taught him the basics of painting. In 1935, his father had to relocate to Calabria for professional reasons. The Tyrrhenian coast where Cremonini would grow up would have a profound impact on his later work. Supported by a grant from the Collegio Venturoli he studied from 1932 to 1936 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna, and then at the Brera Academy in Milan. In 1948 he had his first exhibition in Verona. In Bologna he met Giorgio Morandi. Through him he received another scholarship, which in 1951 enabled him to stay in Paris. His first clients he found in the USA; due to an exhibition in the gallery of Catherine Viviano in 1952. This gallery hosted three more exhibitions of his work during the next ten years. In 1960 an exhibition of his works at the Parisian 'Galerie du Dragon' brought him to the attention of the French public. During the 1960s he joined the ranks of the Figuration Narrative movement in French art. His art was well received and gained critical appreciation by a number of known French and Italian writers and literary figures such as Louis Althusser, Michel Butor, Italo Calvino, R√©gis Debray and Marc Le Bot. The latter gave him a book and an entire lecture schedule in his course about the history of contemporary art at the University of Paris I. Cemonini exhibited the Venice Biennale in 1964. In 1974, he married fellow painter Roberta Crocioni. They had a son named Pietro. From 1983 to 1992 Cremonini served as director of the studio at the √âcole des beaux-arts in Paris. The then Minister of Culture Jack Lang acknowledged his intention for the university to become more open to contemporary art. Paradoxically, Cremonini shut himself off artistically to current trends. The wild, so-called free art of the next generation, represented by artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, he did not feel at all. \\"Painting must not make a noise,\\" he wrote in 1980, \\"because only the doubt is dynamic.\\" Legacy As abstraction and conceptual art gained prominence in the 20th century, Cremonini seemed to be marginalized. But a recent resurgence in figurative art suggest a newfound appreciation for the artist. Among his admirers was fellow artist Francis Bacon, who suggested that his friend poet W.H. Auden write about him. William Ruben, the former director of the MoMA, praised Cremonini by saying that his work embodies a spirit of timeless monumentality. He has been awarded the Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres in France, member of the Royal Academy of Belgium, member of the San Luca National Academy in Rome and of the ‚ÄúAccademia delle Arti e del Disegno‚Äù in Florence. He has also been awarded the Marzotto International Prize in 1969 and the Prize from the Italian President of the Republic in 1979.

History Profile of the Palace Hotel The first hydrographic study of the thermal springs of Vidago occurred in 1863, following several years of visits by Portuguese locals and those seeking medical treatments. At the time there was a belief that the mix of sodium bicarbonates and \\"radioactive\\" elements were helpful in treating digestive problems. Since this period, though, the spas were closed, but at its height (1875 to 1877) was visited by people as important as the King D. Lu√≠s I of Portugal. Between 1876 and 1889 it was awarded prices in Madrid, Paris, Vienna and Rio de Janeiro for its curative properties. The hotel was constructed in 1910, and was considered the most luxurious in the Iberian Peninsula at the time. Designed by architect Jos√© Ferreira da Costa, it was inaugurated by King D. Manuel II at the time of its opening; his brother and father (King Carlos) had visited Vidago for treatment, the centre becoming a centre of concerts, tennis and croquet events and on the island in the park there was a skating rink. In 1995, there was a remodelling of the hotel. Between 2007 and 2008, owing to degradation, Grupo Unicer (the owners) began a program of remodelling and recuperation, in order to create a tourist holiday village, under the direction of architect √Ålvaro Siza Vieira. It was reopened in 6 October 2010, coinciding with the centenary of the original hotel, assisted by then-Prime Minister Jos√© S√≥crates. In 2017, an historical television mini-series set in 1936 called Vidago Palace aired on RTP1.https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/tv/article/Vidago-Palace- series-brings-Downton-13432774.php It was also filmed on location. Architecture The grand staircase of the Vidago Hotel The hotel is located in the millennium park of Vidago, encircled by various species of ancient trees (such as maples, pines and laurels), river runs, pedestrian trails and three natural mineral springs. These springs (called Vidago, Vidago II and Fonte Salus) have differing levels of bicarbonates, sodium and carbon mineral compositions. The five-star hotel, that includes spa and golf resort, includes nine suites and 70 double rooms. The original short 9 hole golf course was designed in 1936 by Mackenzie Ross, known for the Ailsa Course at Turnberry (ranked in the top 20 golf courses in the world). The golf course has been completely remodelled and extended by UK golf designers Cameron Powell, to extend the course by six holes using existing tee and green positions. A golf academy, driving range and practice facilities were also added to the adjoining land, extending the course by 12 new holes. These changes allowed the resort to receive international competitions, that include the Bonallack Trophy and the Patsy Hankins Tournament. The spa was housed in an Art Nouveau pavilion on the grounds that was converted into conference room. It included a sunk pool, stained-glass windows and marble decorated with a mixture of Neoclassical and Moorish styles.

The film tells the story of college student Nastya and her fianc√© Ivan, who go to meet Ivan's family, only to discover that they have a dark past with many secrets to keep and that they may be planning something sinister for her. The Bride was released on 19 January 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics. Plot In 1832, a chemistry doctor called Iosif Gamel presents his thesis to the Imperial Science Academy of Saint-Petersburg which says that the new lens made out of a new type of silver can not only capture light, but also a person's soul. This proves to be true despite the academy rebuking Gamel, resulting in the creation of a ritual, in which the souls of dead people are transferred into another body. A photographer is then shown taking pictures of his dead wife (called The Bride) with carved-out wooden eyes planted on her eyelids. He then travels to a village, where he plans to transfer his wife's soul into a young peasant girl through his wife's ring. He arrives to find the villagers protesting, but he manages to disperse them after killing one of them. The photographer puts the ring on the girl's finger, seals her in the coffin with the dead wife, and prepares to bury the coffin when it suddenly begins to violently shake. When the photographer and his fellow participants in the ritual open up the coffin, they see that the wife's soul has been transferred. The photographer hides the photograph that he took earlier in the basement while waiting for his wife's soul to recover. She awakens one day in her new body, but is appalled at the new situation. In the present day, college student Nastya marries her fianc√© Ivan. She decides to go to his family's house to host their wedding, despite Ivan's objections. They arrive at his family's home, where she is introduced to Ivan's sister Liza. At dinner, Liza gives Nastya a ring with a red-diamond (the ring seen at the beginning of the film), a move which does not resonate well with Ivan. Nastya also begins to experience visions, including seeing clones of herself doing actions in a pattern. One night, she finds Ivan and Liza arguing about keeping Nastya here, and Ivan threatens to leave. The next day, Liza reports that Ivan has gone into town to see his friends, much to Nastya's dismay since he didn't warn her that he was going. Additionally, she begins experiencing more and more visions, and becomes increasingly suspicious about the family's true nature. She also discovers a secret passage inside the walls of the house, and discovers the photograph of The Bride hidden by the photographer at the beginning of the film. The increased suspicions lead to Nastya to attempt to leave the house. However, she suddenly sees a family friend walking nearby with a lantern. Nastya follows the elderly woman to the second house on the plot, where she finds her feeding an imprisoned Ivan, revealing that the family had locked him up inside after his argument with Liza, implying that the family wants Nastya to stay. Ivan notices her, and tells her to run as she encounters a white skinned spirit in a black wedding dress. She falls unconscious while attempting to flee, and subsequently experiences a dream. In it, she walks into the same house, but in the same period as in the beginning of the film, where the photographer goes upstairs to see his wife after she has become reportedly ill. A friend tries to convince him not to go, but he goes anyway. Nastya then sees the photographer being killed by The Bride's malevolent spirit. After killing him, The Bride turns around and says that \\"she\\" (referring to another female person) will take her, before attacking Nastya, waking her up. She is taken back to the house, where she is given coffee that makes her purposely fall asleep. Nastya wakes up the next day, with the \\"wedding\\" being prepared. While getting dressed, she looks at the photograph of the previous matriarchs of the family, and upon looking at their faces, she realises that they are all the same person. Nastya attempts to escape but is bound up by the ritual members and locked up in a room where she encounters the living skeleton possessed by the spirit of The Bride. Ivan rescues Nastya and drives away with her in his car. He reveals that his family is the organiser of the ritual and that they needed her so that The Bride's soul could be transferred into another body. He also reveals that the only way to destroy any more chances of soul transfer is to destroy the photograph of The Bride. Nastya reveals that she knows where the photograph is moments before they are T-boned by the ritual members who capture Nastya and leave Ivan for dead. Nastya is brought back to the manor, where she gets the red- diamond ring put on so that The Bride's soul can be transferred. She is sealed in the coffin and dumped into the ground where she is possessed by The Bride's spirit. When the coffin is opened a possessed Nastya tells the people, \\"The body is ruined\\" before convulsing and falling back into the coffin. It is revealed that the ritual failed because Nastya and Ivan had earlier consummated their relationship, leaving Nastya and Ivan non-virgins. The members then disperse, and the leader is killed by the spirit soon afterwards. Ivan, who had managed to survive the car crash, makes it back to the house and finds the unconscious Nastya. Meanwhile, Liza and her children are confronted by The Bride's spirit, and the children flee to the secret passage. Nastya, remembering about the photograph, goes to the room where she found it, encountering the children there but The Bride's spirit appears. Liza, knowing that the red-diamond ring attracts the spirit, takes it from Nastya, puts it on herself and is possessed by the spirit. Nastya takes the photograph and confronts Liza, who has taken one of the children. Liza attacks her, and she drops and loses the photograph in the process. As she is about to kill Nastya, the child calls out to her, snapping Liza out of her possession. She tells Nastya to take care of her children before sacrificing herself by breaking a lantern and dying in the fire, allowing Nastya, Ivan and the children to escape the house. Soon afterwards, a new family arrives at the house, intending to purchase and renovate it. They notice a hole in the wall, and when they look through it, a figure slides past them.

The poem was published in the August 1918 issue of The Egoist. Moore's biographer, Linda Leavell, has described \\"The Fish\\" as \\"...one of Moore's best-loved and most mystifying poems\\" and that it is \\"Admired for its imagery and technical proficiency\\".Leavell 2013, p. 157. The poem was later included in Moore's 1921 collection Observations, where it appeared alongside \\"Reinforcements\\". The placing of the two poems in the book has been interpreted by critic John Slatin as a commentary by Moore on World War I, due to her brother's service as a chaplain in the United States Navy.

Van de Waal was born in Rotterdam. In 1934 he finished his education as an art historian in Leiden with a monography on Jan van Goyen.Henri van de Waal in the NNBW He accepted a position at the National Print Cabinet in The Hague, where he began work on a German concept of image-based historical research, which due to the special circumstances of the interbellum period was drastically reduced. He eventually finished his PhD thesis 12 July 1940, cum laude, on the patriotic subject of Zeventiende eeuwsche uitbeeldingen van den Bataafschen Opstand (17th-century images of the Batavian Revolt). Four months later he was dismissed as part of the actions by the German occupational forces against Jews. Grave of Hans van de Waal in Katwijk Soon after being released from internship in Westerbork in 1945, he took up work as an assistant professor in Leiden, but was appointed a full professorship in art history the same December. In 1946 he presented his ideas about mapping the iconography of art history with \\"beeld-leer\\", an image-based concept of recording form, function and content with one code. He remained professor and director of the print cabinet until his death resulting from kidney damage contracted during a case of scarlet fever he had while in Westerbork.Henri van de Waal on the Westerbork memorial website Van de Waal was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957. His \\"beeld-leer\\" resulted in the D.I.A.L. (Decimal Index of the Art of the Low Countries) based on the Dewey Decimal System, and later called Iconclass. Henri van de Waal died in Leiden.  Episodes  For an image titled View of the Heiligewegspoort (Heiligeweg gate) attributed to Lievens, Henri van de Waal had pointed out that its creator could be Jan Andrea Lievens, or the son of the attributed. Werner Sumowski took that suggestion into account and in editing Lievens's catalogue, the picture in question was not included.Schneider, H. (1932) Jan Lievens: sein leben und seine werke. Haarlem : De Erven F. Bohn N.V. Among the same collection presently at Leiden University, van de Waal also noted Man arriving in a village, a sheep on his shoulders, Old Testament scene? could be a copy after Van Bronckhorst, which is now attributed to Jan Gerritsz van Bronckhorst. Van de Waal nominated Albertus Welcker for an honorary doctorate in arts and philosophy in 1955, as the year fell on the \\"Rembrandt Year\\", recognizing Welcker's endeavor and contribution on building a collection of Dutch paintings. Jaap Hillenius exchanged letters with Van de Waal, and one such is among the collection of the Library of Linden University with a drawing of a standing man on the wrong side.

He was known as Robinhood in his native district of Kasur. Punjab has a folklore tradition of appreciating the role of dacoits such as Malangi who defied the authorities of the period and sided with common people. Other such well-known Punjab 'Robin Hoods' were Nizam Lohar, Imam Din Gohavia and Jagga Jatt, who were considered folk heroes by people during the early part of the 20th century.http://www.dawn.com/news/1253625 Songs of the bravery of these dacoits are sung even today.

His father passed away when he was just six months old. The land which his father left for Malangi was captured by the feudal lords who dominated the area. Malangi's mother was helpless after the death of her husband, and she married a Sikh despite being a Muslim herself. When he realized that his land had been appropriated by the landlords of his village, Malangi fought to reclaim it. The landlords, who were British-appointed Lumbardar managed to isolate Malangi in the local community, and in anger he became a dacoit.http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta2/tft/article.php?issue=20120127&page;=26 References Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:People from Kasur District ","title":"Malangi (Dacuit)"},{"id":"51982472","text":"General Arthur Joseph Marie Guyot d'Asni√®res de Salins (3 December 1857 - 11 August 1936) was a French military officer of the First World War, known as \\"the conqueror of Douaumont\\" in 1916, best known for being one of the founders of Scouting in France along with Jacques Sevin, the canon Cornette, Paul Coze and √âdouard de Macedo.

The tax applies mainly to waste management companies and local authorities disposing of waste at landfill. History As part of further devolution of powers to the Scottish Government, the Scotland Act 2012 allowed the Government to introduce and raise a Landfill Tax. The Landfill Tax (Scotland) Bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament on 17 April 2013 by John Swinney MSP. It was discussed by and subsequently passed by Parliament in late 2013 and became law on 21 January 2014, having received Royal Assent. Sections 34, 35, 40, 41, 42 and 44 of the Act came into force on the day of Royal Ascent, with the remainder coming into force through later orders of the Scottish Ministers. Taxation Scottish Landfill Tax became payable from 1 April 2015 on qualifying deposits of waste at landfill. The Act specified that the tax payable for disposal of waste at landfill would be set by multiplying the standard rate by the weight of the deposit, with the rate to be specified by the Scottish Ministers in a later order. The initial rate of tax was set at ¬£82.60 for the standard rate and ¬£2.60 for the lower rate. As of 1 April 2016, these increased, with the standard rate of Scottish Landfill Tax set at ¬£84.40 per tonne, and a lower rate of ¬£2.68 per tonne applying to \\"qualifying materials\\", which includes deposits such as waste soils and minerals.

Modalities include antiestrogens or estrogen blockers such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen, selective estrogen receptor degraders like fulvestrant, and aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole and ovariectomy. A breast biopsy is tested for whether the cancer cells contain estrogen or progesterone receptors. A breast cancer that is positive for estrogen receptors is usually also progesterone receptor positive. This type of cancer is called ER/PR positive, which constitutes approximately 80% of all breast cancers. ER positive cancers use estrogen to grow, so administering endocrine therapy to a patient diagnosed with ER/PR positive cancer will depress tumor growth. Endocrine therapy should not be confused with menopausal hormone therapy or hormone replacement therapy, which is using estrogen and/or progesterone supplements to relieve symptoms of menopause. Estrogen feeds breast cancer cells, so when a woman on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is diagnosed with ER/PR positive breast cancer, her doctor will ask her to stop the HRT. Patients that have tumors small enough to take out with surgery will receive endocrine therapy after their surgery, which is part of adjuvant therapy. Large tumors may receive neo-adjuvant therapy via chemotherapy or radiation to shrink the tumor small enough to operate on.  Types of Endocrine Therapy Medication  = Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) = SERMs act by mimicking estrogen and replacing estrogen on estrogen receptors, blocking estrogen from binding and preventing tumors from using estrogen to grow. They do not interfere with estrogen production. Tamoxifen (Nolvadex¬Æ) is a commonly used drug for pre-menopausal women diagnosed with ER/PR positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen selectively blocks the effect of estrogen in breast tissue but acts as an estrogen agonist in the uterus and in bone. Research shows that women on tamoxifen for at least 5 years out of surgery are less likely to have recurrent breast cancer, including new breast cancer in the other breast, and death at 15 years.

Description Caladenia bicalliata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme, high with up to three flowers, each flower long and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect and abruptly narrows about one-third of its length from the base. The lateral sepals and petals are cream or greenish- cream and are much shorter than those of the similar C. abbreviata and C. evanescens. The dorsal sepals and petals have reddish-brown or pale yellow tips, depending on subspecies. The labellum is white, sometimes with red stripes and has two rows of white calli along its centre. Flowering occurs between August and early October but the flowers are only open for a day or two or may not open at all. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia bicalliata was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1909 from a specimen collected at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island. The description was published in Transactions, proceedings and report, Royal Society of South Australia.

Boris Revout Biography =Early life and education= Boris Revut was born in St. Petersburg, Russia to a scientific family. Already at the school, he showed an interest in the natural sciences. He studied (1965‚Äì1970) organic chemistry at the Pedagogical University of St. Petersburg. During his education he was also occupied with a scientific work in a new field of phosphor-organic chemistry (Abramov reaction), that was connected with the organic aminophosphonic acids. These analogies to amino acids, important constituents of proteins, possessed the quality of complex ligands and medicines. Revut graduated from the university and his diploma was distinguished as one of the best by the union competition of young scientists. Simultaneously he studied contemporaneous English (language and literature) at the same university. Revut took his doctoral degree at the chemical department of Saint Petersburg State University in the area of colloid chemistry and nanotechnology. His dissertation was dedicated to a new direction of force microscopy. He developed a method of determination of interaction force, which enabled to carry out the measuring of connection between surfaces with different nature. A researcher observed practically the contact time, which the micro-objects together remained. =Nano particles theory= Accordingly, it would have been calculated through the theory of interaction of nano particles the force of the desired connection. It was possible to investigate with this method also the adhesion of the particles to macro surfaces as soon as the interaction of large biomolecules between themselves. This work preceded the invention of first force microscopes. For the latter invention three scientists Ernst Ruska, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer received the 1986 Physics Nobel Prize. The results of doctor's thesis Revut were taken in the textbooks of colloid chemistry . =Scientific expert= Later Revut worked over 20 years at the large state scientific enterprise of paper-pulp industry, where he went the way from an engineer up to a leading expert. He was busy with the environment protection), water purification, biotechnology and fine chemical processing. Throughout this extent, he developed the methods of removal of metal ions, petroleum products, poisonous organic substances, hormones, pesticides and gaseous compounds. He elaborated the means for determination of heavy metals, trace elements, petroleum products, organic compounds, nano particles and bioactive substances in water and waste water. He improved the biotechnological processes of the yeast production, water purification and sludge utilization. His inventions were protected with more than 50 Russian patents and distinguished with prizes. =Manager and writer= In 1996‚Äì2002 he worked as a manager at the Institute of Biotechnology Applications in Environment Protection and Medicine in Hamburg. There he succeeded to implement some earlier scientific ideas of him. Since 2006 he engages as a writer. Meanwhile, he has written altogether 21 fiction and poetry books in Russian and German. In his novels he describes violent political and social themes of the past and present. His characters are representations of a lot of professions and social groups, who struggle for freedom and justice. Personal Revut is married to the artist Natalia Revut. She illustrates apart from everything else also his books. The married couple has a son and a grandson. Works * With rhymes through space and time.

She has been a Senator for Victoria since October 2016, representing the Labor Party. Early life Kitching was born in Brisbane, the daughter of Bill and Leigh Kitching. She grew up in the suburb of St Lucia, where she was a childhood friend of Chloe Shorten. Her father was a chemistry professor, and during her youth the family spent time in England, Spain, France, Germany, and the United States as her father received academic postings. Kitching completed her schooling at Brisbane Girls Grammar School and then studied arts and law at the University of Queensland. She joined Young Labor as a student. Pre-politics career Kitching was admitted as a solicitor by the Supreme Court of Queensland. She moved to Melbourne in 1995. In the private sector, she worked for LookSmart before it was listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, IQ Media (the company operated by her husband Andrew Landeryou) and Drake International, where she was the head of Government and Corporate Relations. From December 2012, Kitching worked as the General Manager of the Victorian No. 1 Branch of the Health Services Union, leaving after a few years. In 2014, she was called to give evidence to the Royal Commission into trade union governance and corruption relating to her time with the Health Services Union. In 2015 a Vice President of the Fair Work Commission found that Kitching had illegally completed testing on behalf of other union officials to gain right of entry permits. Political career Kitching has been involved in Victorian Labor politics for some time, including being vice-president of the party's Victorian Branch. She was a Melbourne City Councillor in the early 2000s, and was a senior adviser to several ministries in the government of Labor premier Steve Bracks, as well as to John Lenders, the treasurer in the Brumby government. In the 2013 Australian federal election, Kitching made a bid for Labor pre-selection for the Victorian electorates of Lalor and Gellibrand. Her bid was unsuccessful due to opposition from within the party, including from Stephen Conroy. On 13 October 2016, Kitching won pre-selection to fill the Victorian Senate seat vacated by Stephen Conroy's resignation on 30 September. Kitching's pre-selection was supported by her close friend, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, and by the Labor Right. Shorten's support for Kitching generated tension in the party with former frontbencher Anthony Albanese refusing to support her pre-selection, and legal affairs spokesperson Mark Dreyfus threatening to resign from his position in the shadow cabinet, although he did not carry out the threat. =Senator (2016‚Äìpresent)= Kitching was formally sworn in as a Senator on 7 November 2016. After the 2019 election, Kitching was included in Anthony Albanese's shadow ministry as Shadow Assistant Minister for Government Accountability. She was also made Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate. Senator Kitching has been prominent in criticising her counterparts in the Victorian ALP, for their support of China's global Belt and Road Initiative saying \\"The Victorian government should not have entered into an agreement with the Chinese government on the Belt and Road Initiative - it is bad policy and bad optics.\\" On 4 June 2020 Kitching was announced as a founding member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China. In an interview on ABC radio, Kitching said the alliance of 13 democratic nations was to see that: > ...our rules based order is protected. There‚Äôs a great desire amongst the > group to examine human rights issues. I think Western liberal democracies > probably hoped that China was heading down a more liberal and democratic > path. But I think when President Xi became president in 2013, that became a > fainter and fainter hope. Personal life Kitching is married to Andrew Landeryou, previously a well- known political blogger; her father-in-law Bill Landeryou was a state government minister in Victoria. The couple married in 2000 after meeting at a Labor fundraising night in country New South Wales. In 2001, the couple purchased Wardlow, a heritage-listed mansion in Parkville, Melbourne. The couple separated due to financial difficulties in the mid-2000s, and Kitching filed for bankruptcy in 2005, selling Wardlow to clear her debts; the bankruptcy was annulled in 2006. They did not divorce and later resumed their relationship.

It was developed by Ken Perlin at the NYU Media Research Lab and presented at the ACM UIST '98 conference. Perlin described the technique as quicker than Graffiti however the learning curve was steeper with at most people taking an hour to become moderately effective. The technique works by keeping the stylus continuously on the screen. A method of using the system involves thinking of screen in terms of a flower with eight petals and a stamen. Eight characters or punctuation are allocated to each petal and the stylus is moved from petal to petal via the stamen or directly to form words. Eventually a user learns the shape for particular words and the process becomes quicker. Quikwriting was reported by the Economist to have gain a small following on Palm PDAs and that by 2005 Microsoft had licensed the Quikwriting and were using it as part of the XNav project.

At the end of the 17th century, the style firmly established itself among architects of the Moscow Baroque. The combination of contrasting forms of this type of church gives striving upward look as dynamism is a characteristic of the Baroque style. Octagon-on-cube churches continued to be built in Russian provinces until the end of the 18th century. Evolution of Moscow Baroque With regard to the Moscow Baroque, there are several different types of octagon-on-cube churches. The main one is a stand-alone, multi-level church, built mainly by the Russian nobility for their suburban estates. The essential attribute of these buildings is a combination of church and bell tower in a single composition. Directly over the octagon level was arranged an open level with eight bells.

The building was designed by Marshall Clifton in 1935, and is an Inter-War Mediterranean/Spanish Mission style two-storey hotel.  History  The Captain Stirling Hotel is situated on Stirling Highway between Stanley Street and Florence Road. It was constructed between April and December 1935 for Edward Bartram \\"Bertie\\" Johnston. The newspapers at the time reported that the hotel was constructed for N. B. Robinson, however Robinson was actually Johnston's solicitor (from the legal firm Abbott, Abbott, Andrews & Robinson) who made the license application on Johnston's behalf, whilst he was out of the state. It was designed by the architectural partnership of George Herbert Parry and Marshall Clifton. The Captain Stirling Hotel was the first of three Inter-War Spanish Mission style hotels designed by Parry & Clifton, the second being the Inglewood Hotel (1935) and the third was the Big Bell Hotel near Cue (1936). The hotel was constructed by E. A. Allwood for a cost of ¬£10,000. Allwood was also responsible for constructing the Inglewood Hotel, the Capitol Theatre, New Oxford Theatre and the Plaza Theatre. During the 1950s, the eastern end of the building was extended with an office, associated entrance area, manager's quarters and a staircase. In 1958 the owners opened the state's first drive- through bottle shop with vehicular access from Stirling Highway. It was designed with a modern butterfly roof by Bill Evans, from Marshall Clifton's architectural practice. In 1986 Marie Wordsworth, the daughter of Bertie Johnston, commissioned architects, Overman & Ziudeveld, to undertake extensive remodelling of the building, which included landscaping works and the expansion of the ground floor space to make it larger and more viable for functions.  Architectural character  Cape Dutch influenced gable, with small juliet balcony The Captain Stirling Hotel and drive-through bottle shop comprises a two-storey rendered masonry and tile hotel and a single-storey rendered masonry and asbestos bottle shop, adjacent to the hotel. The hotel is located close to Stirling Highway, with a courtyard below footpath level at the front of the building. The bottle shop is located in the car park, and accessed from Stirling Highway and Stanley Street. A carpark behind both buildings is accessed via Florence Road and Stanley Street. The hotel displays characteristics of Inter-War Mediterranean/Spanish Mission style of architecture, with arched openings, supported on pre-cast concrete twisted columns, first floor balconies, a central Dutch influenced gable, steel framed windows and arched entry supported on masonry columns. A balcony in the gable has a round arched opening with concrete moulding, and a juliet balcony with wrought iron tracery between the concrete balustrades. The bottle shop has rendered and painted masonry walls, with a distinctive asbestos clad butterfly roof and steel framed windows.  Heritage value  The hotel was nominated for the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission in November 1997 and was permanently registered on 26 October 1999. On 22 April 1998 it was classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA), with the City of Nedlands including it on their Municipal Heritage Inventory (adopted 27 April 1999). The hotel and bottle shop received interim listing on the State Register by the Heritage Council of Western Australia on 9 February 2016 and was permanently registered on 30 August 2016.

Between 1956 and 1978 she was the head of the \\"Publications, Book trade and Academic Libraries department\\" (\\"Sektor Verlage, Buchhandel und wissenschaftliche Bibliotheken\\"), working in the Knowledge Section of the powerful Party Central Committee. There was always a reluctance on the part of the authorities to acknowledge the existence of state censorship. It is nevertheless believed that Lucie Pflug's job gave her significant influence over what was published, and therefore over what was available to be read, in the German Democratic Republic. Life Lucie Pflug was born in Kunersdorf, a small village in Brandenburg, east of Berlin. Her father was a blacksmith. She attended school locally and then, between 1930 and 1932, trained for work as a typist. Between 1932 and 1934 she was unemployed. In 1934 she took a secretarial job with the Berlin publishers, Delius, Klasing & Co., with whom she remained till 1943 working on the motor magazine Allgemeinen Automobil-Zeitung. Between 1943 and 1945 she is recorded as a \\"housewife\\", latterly in K√∂ssern. She showed an interest in socialist politics early on, joining the Youngs Communists in 1932. At the beginning of 1933 r√©gime change heralded twelve years of one party dictatorship. Political parties (other than the Nazi party) were banned Lucie Pflug continued to undertake illegal political work in Berlin. War ended in May 1945: now in the Soviet occupation zone she joined (or possibly rejoined) the Communist Party of Germany. After April 1946 she was one of thousands who lost no time in signing their party membership across to the newly formed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). In 1946 she joined the Berlin publisher Aufbau-Verlag, initially as a secretary on the editorial staff and later as an editor. In 1949, the year in which the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as a separate German state, the German Democratic Republic, she became head of the office at the weekly newspaper, Sonntag (Wochenzeitung). At the same time she joined the works council executive at the publisher. Between 1952 and 1954 she was the (SED) party secretary at Aufbau-Verlag. This was a politically important position under a political structure which insisted that \\"Where there is a comrade, the party is there too\\" (\\"Wo ein Genosse ist, da ist die Partei\\"). In 1952 Pflug was a member of the first cohort of students on the further education course for the publishing industry held by the \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" legal academy (\\"Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaft\\" / ASR) at Potsdam. In 1954/55 she attended a training at the party's \\"Karl Marx\\" academy. In 1956 she was appointed to head up the \\"Publications, Book trade and Academic Libraries department\\" (\\"Sektor Verlage, Buchhandel und wissenschaftliche Bibliotheken\\"), under the direction of the Party Central Committee. Here she played an important role in defining a direction for literature and the publishing/book industries in conformity with the party line. Neues Deutschland, the party's mass circulation newspaper, paid tribute to her on the occasion of her sixtieth birthday: * \\"In a twenty year career as section leader for the Central Committee of the SED, she rendered lasting service to the successful development of publishing and the book trade in the German Democratic Republic.\\"Genossin Lucie Pflug. In: Neues Deutschland, 25 February 1976 * \\"In ihrer zwanzigj√§hrigen T√§tigkeit als Sektorenleiter des ZK der SED erwarb sie sich bleibende Verdienste um die erfolgreiche Entwicklung des Verlagswesens und des Buchhandels in der DDR\\" She remained in post for another two years, till 1978. After her retirement in 1978, she remained a member of the board of the Publishers' Association for a further ten years, till 1988. Lucie Pflug died in Berlin on 9 November 1993.

All have been found preserved in amber, either from the Baltic or Bitterfeld, Germany. First described in 1854, Archaea species have a distinctive \\"neck\\" separating the head from the thorax, and very long chelicerae (\\"jaws\\"). Description In the genus Archaea, the head is separated from the thorax by a deep fold, forming a \\"neck\\", so that the globular head appears to sit on the thorax. There are eight eyes, four on each side of the head, arranged in the shape of a rhombus, with the front eyes being the largest. The curved chelicerae are very long, longer than the head, with long, strong fangs. The pedipalps of the female are very small and thin, shorter than the chelicerae, the third and last segments being short, the latter needle-shaped. Those of the male are sturdier, the third segment being almost as long as the second, with the end segment bearing the palpal bulbs. The thorax is relatively flat, narrower at the back than the front, and without thoracic grooves. The legs are long and thin. The first pair are the longest, the second somewhat longer than the fourth, the third being the shortest. The patellae and tarsi are short, without spines or bristles. Living members of the family Archaeidae are predators on other spiders (araneophageous); it is assumed that extinct members of the family had the same habits. Taxonomy The genus Archaea was erected in 1854 by C. L. Koch and G. C. Berendt, initially with three extinct species, all found in amber from the Baltic Sea or Bitterfeld in Saxony- Anhalt, Germany. It was then the only genus in the family Archaeidae. The first living species in the family was described in 1881 by O. Pickard- Cambridge. He placed it in the genus Eriauchenius as E. workmani. In 1895, Eug√®ne Simon transferred this species to Archaea as Archaea workmani. Other living species were placed in the genus later, but all are now considered to belong to different genera. =Species= *‚Ä†?Archaea bitterfeldensis Wunderlich, 2004 ‚Äì Bitterfeld amber *‚Ä†Archaea compacta Wunderlich, 2004 ‚Äì Baltic amber *‚Ä†Archaea paradoxa C.L.

Description Corymbia umbonata is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has thin, rough, tessellated bark on the trunk, often also on the branches, smooth creamy pink to pale grey bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to elliptical leaves that are long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are lance-shaped or curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle long and wide, usually with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering has been observed in March and April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is an urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming The rusty bloodwood was first formally described in 1985 by Denis John Carr and Stella Grace Maisie Carr who gave it the name Eucalyptus umbonata and published the description in their book, Eucalyptus 1 - New or little-known species of the Corymbosae. The type specimens were collected by Laurence Adams near Katherine in 1964. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia umbonata, publishing the change in the journal Telopea.

The stable originated on October 12, 2016, originally composed of Eric Young, Wolfe, Cross, and Sawyer Fulton. After Fulton suffered an injury the following month, he was replaced by Dain on January 18, 2017. Young and Wolfe are former NXT Tag Team Champions, having won the titles at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III by defeating The Authors of Pain. On April 17, 2018, as Sanity was called up to SmackDown during the 2018 WWE Superstar Shake-up, it was revealed that Cross would be staying on NXT as a singles competitor, thus splitting her from the group. Dain revealed during a Q&A; that Cross would remain a member of Sanity despite the separation. On April 15, 2019, Young was drafted to Raw during 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up thus ending the group.  History  = Origins = According to original member Sawyer Fulton, Sanity's concept came from Triple H, who was inspired by the film Smokin' Aces, \\"long before 2016\\". It was originally pitched to Fulton, Solomon Crowe, and Marcus Louis, but this incarnation never came to be, as, according to Fulton: \\"we tried a few things but it did not fit. Then [Crowe] left the company and Marcus was fired, so I was alone again.\\" = NXT (2016‚Äì2018) = The concept was brought back after Fulton was randomly paired up with Alexander Wolfe in a match against The Hype Bros at a live event, as the two enjoyed working with each other. After a series of cryptic vignettes teasing the stable, it was announced on October 4, 2016 that \\"Sanity\\" would be part of the second annual Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament, although the nature of the group and the identity of its members remained anonymous. In the first round of the tournament on the October 12 episode of NXT, the stable made their debut, appearing as four hooded individuals. Wolfe and Fulton were the first to unmask, and faced the team of Tye Dillinger and Bobby Roode, winning their first round match after Roode walked out on his partner. After the match, Eric Young and Nikki Cross revealed themselves as the last two members of the stable; it was Young's debut as an NXT wrestler, although he had previously faced Samoa Joe on May 4 while not under contract. The following week on the October 19 episode of NXT, Cross made her in-ring debut against Danielle Kamela; she originally won the match, but continued to assault Kamela afterwards, forcing the referee to reverse his decision. Wolfe and Fulton went on to defeat T.J. Perkins and Kota Ibushi in the second round of the tournament on November 2, but were eliminated by TM61 in the semi-finals on November 9. Shortly after the tournament, Fulton suffered a torn pectoral. He was subsequently written off. On November 30, after Sanity teased that Fulton was no longer associated with the group after Young stomped on Fulton's jacket before kicking it out of the ring, Damo was teased as a potential new member of Sanity by attacking No Way Jose but he threw away Fulton's jacket. On January 18, right after Tye Dillinger refused to join Sanity, Damo, now using the name Killian Dain, officially joined the group by attacking Dillinger and accepting Fulton's jacket. Fulton never re-appeared on television, and was ultimately released by WWE on November 3, 2017. He later praised Dain as his replacement, calling him \\"a great person and great fighter.\\" At NXT TakeOver: San Antonio, Young defeated Dillinger, while Cross was unsuccessful in capturing the NXT Women's Championship in a Fatal 4-Way match won by defending champion Asuka. Dillinger continued his feud with Sanity, gaining new allies with No Way Jose, Roderick Strong, and the debuting Ruby Riott. The eight-people feud culminated at NXT TakeOver: Orlando, where Sanity defeated Dillinger, Strong, Riot and Kassius Ohno (a replacement for Jose, who was attacked earlier in the night by Sanity). Sanity's feud with Dillinger ended on the April 19, 2017 episode of NXT, when Dillinger, who had recently been drafted to SmackDown, had his last NXT match, he defeated Young in a steel cage match. At NXT TakeOver: Chicago, Young suffered his first pinfall defeat to Roderick Strong whilst Nikki Cross once again failed to win the women's title in a triple threat match against Asuka and Riot. After a series of confrontations between Sanity and the NXT Tag Team Champions The Authors of Pain throughout July, it was announced on August 2, that Dain and Wolfe would face the champions for the title at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III. At the event, Wolfe started the match, but instead of tagging Dain in, tagged Young, effectively making him his partner; Wolfe and Young defeated The Authors of Pain, becoming NXT Tag Team Champions. Following the celebration, they were attacked by Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly, who formed the new stable The Undisputed Era with Adam Cole later the same night. Dain subsequently also defended the titles under the Freebird Rule, but was not recognized as champion. On the September 20 episode of NXT, Sanity helped Drew McIntyre against The Undisputed Era, thus turning the stable face in the process. At NXT TakeOver: WarGames, Young, Wolfe and Dain faced The Undisputed Era and the team of The Authors of Pain and Roderick Strong in a WarGames match, the first one in 20 years, but ultimately lost when Young was pinned by Cole. On the December 20 episode of NXT, Young and Dain lost the NXT Tag Team Championship to Fish and O'Reilly. At NXT TakeOver: New Orleans on April 7, 2018, Dain unsuccessfully competed in a six-man ladder match to determine the inaugural NXT North American Champion against EC3, Lars Sullivan, Ricochet, Velveteen Dream and eventual winner Adam Cole. = Move to main roster and break-up (2018‚Äì2019) = On the April 17, 2018 episode of SmackDown Live, a vignette aired to promote Sanity's debut as part of the 2018 WWE Superstar Shake-up. Later in the night it was revealed that Cross would be staying on NXT as a singles competitor. On June 19, Sanity made their debut on Smackdown Live beating down The Usos prior to their scheduled tag match, turning back to heels. At Extreme Rules, Sanity defeated The New Day in a six man tag team tables match. Following that win, the stable was nearly completely absent from television for the remainder of the year. On the April 2, 2019 episode of SmackDown Live, all three members of Sanity were defeated by The Miz in a handicap falls count anywhere match. During their year on SmackDown they did not win a single match as a team.https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/exclusives/stats-4119-wwe- raw-4219-smackdown-sean-ross-sapp-fightfulcom A WWE.com article blamed their lack of success on Smackdown on being \\"in the same division as The New Day, The Bar, The Usos and The Bludgeon Brothers.\\"https://www.wwe.com/article/2018-superstar-shake-up-graded-one-year- later The team disbanded on April 15, 2019 when Young was drafted to Raw during 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up. The following day, Killian Dain indicated that SAnitY was finished when he tweeted to Young and Wolfe, \\"I'll miss you both terribly. Had the time of my life as part of Sanity!! You are phenomenal in the ring and outside of it. Thanks to everyone who supported us.\\"https://twitter.com/KillianDain/status/1118117597881483264 The next day, Wolfe thanked his Sanity stablemates and said goodbye to WWE and Sanity in a Twitter post.https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/fight-size-update-alexander- wolfe-says-goodbye-austin-aries-tease-kenta-more On April 20, 2019, Wolfe debuted in the NXT UK brand, teaming with Marcel Barthel, Fabian Aichner, and Walter to form a stable called Imperium.

The film stars Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, James Marsden, Milla Jovovich, and Jessica Biel, and follows a group of journalists at Knight Ridder's Washington Bureau who investigate the rationale behind the Bush Administration's then-impending 2003 invasion of Iraq. The film had its world premiere at the Zurich Film Festival on September 30, 2017. It was released through DirecTV Cinema on June 14, 2018, before having a limited release in theatres on July 13, 2018, by Vertical Entertainment. Premise Journalists investigate the assertions by the Bush Administration concerning Saddam Hussein's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction as a reason for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Knight Ridder Washington reporters Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay received the Raymond Clapper Memorial award from the Senate Press Gallery on February 5, 2004, for their coverage of the questionable intelligence used to justify war with Iraq. Cast  Production  On July 12, 2016, Woody Harrelson was set as one of the leads of the film, reteaming with Reiner after LBJ. On July 13, 2016, James Marsden was added as well. =Filming= Principal photography on the film began in Louisiana on October 5, 2016. In October 2016, Alec Baldwin left the cast, reportedly due to financial timing. In November 2016, filming also took place in Washington, D.C. Walcott has said he believed the film to be essentially \\"word-for-word\\" accurate. At one point in the film, Walcott gives an inspiring speech to the newsroom, but the original script had a screenwriter's version. On the day of shooting, Strobel said to Reiner that he should use Walcott's original words; Reiner had Walcott write down his exact speech, and Reiner then performed and filmed the scene. Release The film had its world premiere at the Zurich Film Festival on September 30, 2017. Shortly after, Vertical Entertainment and DirecTV Cinema acquired distribution rights to the film. The film was released through DirecTV on June 14, 2018, before beginning a limited release in 100 theaters on July 13, 2018. Reception =Box office= Shock and Awe grossed $77,980 in the United States and Canada and $104,435 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $182,415, plus $2.6 million with home video sales. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 29% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 4.69/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Shock and Awe has a worthy story to tell and some fine actors trying to bring it to life; unfortunately, the end results are still as derivative as they are dramatically inert.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, David Fear gave the film 2/5 stars, saying, \\"It's an important story to remember right now, assuming you can remember anything after being beaten over the head with talking points for 90 minutes. But at its best, Shock and Awe still feels like it strains to be Spotlight-lite and comes up lacking. The title is a misnomer.\\" Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"It's trite and mechanistic in its attempts to build pathos while also making its arguments, from the opening scene featuring a soldier paralyzed by an IED to the absolute low point, a date between Marsden's reporter and his pretty next-door neighbor, played by Jessica Biel.\\" Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"The reporting team at Knight Ridder Newspapers has been called 'the only ones who got it right' about Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction that sparked the 2003 Iraq war. Based on a true story, Rob Reiner's Shock and Awe gives much-deserved credit to their far-sighted (if generally unheeded) news coverage, but the message tends to melt into a paint- by-numbers screenplay that pushes too many genre buttons to be thoroughly exciting.\\"  References   External links   Category:2017 films Category:Films directed by Rob Reiner Category:Films shot in Louisiana Category:Iraq War films Category:Castle Rock Entertainment films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:Biographical films about journalists Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Films shot in Washington, D.C.

Dedham North Granite has a compositionally highly variable suite ranging from leucogranites to granodiorites, tonalites, and quartz diorite. The granites originated by partial melting of a sedimentary protolith, while the intermediate members show a mixing of granitic magma and mafic magma. Uses The rock has been used for many notable building projects in and around Dedham. It was used for St. Mary's Church (1880), St. Paul's Church (1858), Memorial Hall (1868), the Boston and Providence Railroad station (1882), the Dedham Public Library (1888), Trinity Church in Copley Square. There are several pieces of it arranged decoratively along East Street in Dedham, between High and Avery Streets. These pieces were remnants of the railroad abutment that was dismantled in 2008. Plymouth Rock is also a piece of Dedham Granite, having been moved to the coast by a glacier 20,000 years ago.

It stars Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar ‚Äì a Colombian drug lord and the leader of the Medell√≠n Cartel, with Boyd Holbrook, Pedro Pascal, Joanna Christie, Juan Pablo Raba, Diego Cata√±o, Paulina Gait√°n, Paulina Garc√≠a, Bruno Bichir, Ra√∫l M√©ndez, Manolo Cardona, Cristina Uma√±a, Dami√°n Alc√°zar and Eric Lange playing various real life based characters. All 10 episodes of the season became available for streaming on Netflix on September 2, 2016, and were met with more favorable critical reviews than the first season, with critics particularly praising the performance of Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar. On September 6, 2016, Netflix renewed the series for a third and fourth season. Synopsis Season 2 begins where Season 1 ended. Some soldiers find Escobar and his entourage right outside the perimeter of La Catedral, but are too petrified of Escobar to make an arrest. The US sends a new ambassador who brings the CIA into play. At first, there is little change for Escobar as he adjusts to life outside La Catedral since he still has the loyalty of his cartel. However, his control starts to slip since he needs a lot of time and resources to hide from the government. He uses several tricks to avoid being caught. He travels undetected by hiring Lim√≥n, a pimp and taxi driver who hires his childhood friend Maritza to sit in the backseat as a decoy while Escobar hides in the trunk and young look-outs report the Search Bloc's attempts to find him. However, as the tide starts to turn against Escobar, Lim√≥n and Maritza try to have him arrested by the police and the DEA by having Maritza go to Javier Pe√±a's fianc√©e's house with intel on Escobar. In the meantime, the Cali Cartel forms an alliance with the right-wing Casta√±o brothers, Don Berna, and Judy Moncada, whose husband Kiko was murdered by Escobar in Season 1. Judy vows to have revenge against Escobar after he kills her brother Jaime. In a meeting with the Cali Cartel leaders, Judy reluctantly gives the location of Escobar's drug labs to the Search Bloc, resulting in the arrest of multiple cartel members. Enraged, Escobar ambushes a convoy, killing nearly all of the police officers. Among the dead is the leader of the Search Bloc, Colonel Horacio Carrillo, who had killed Escobar's cousin Gustavo and tracked Escobar for years. Hugo Mart√≠nez \\"Flaco\\" replaces Carrillo and continues the anti-drug war. Later we learn that Lim√≥n was working both sides, selling information to Pe√±a on Escobar's orders and tricking Maritza about the ambush. The Colombian police and Escobar engage in massive battles, resulting in high tension and unrest in Colombia. Agent Pe√±a starts working with the vigilante death squad \\"Los Pepes\\" ‚Äî who work for the Casta√±o brothers and, in effect, the Cali Cartel who later kill Valeria Velez and Escobar's lawyer, Fernando Duque. After discovering the Cali Cartel is behind the attacks, Escobar decides to go to war against the Cali Cartel by bombing their goods around Colombia. He sets off a bomb during the wedding reception for Gilberto's daughter, injuring several people, but Gilberto, one of the leaders of the Cali Cartel, and his daughter and companions survive. Angered at Escobar's merciless attack, Gilberto orders his men to kill the remaining men who work for Medell√≠n Cartel. He has Los Pepes follow Escobar's mother, Hermilda, from church and attack the Escobar family in their home, killing Tata's brother, Carlos. Devastated, Escobar attempts to smuggle his family to Germany, but Steve Murphy follows them and has the German customs deport Hermilda, Tata, and her children to Colombia. Enraged, Escobar places a bomb outside a shopping mall near the Presidential Palace in Bogot√°, killing hundreds, most of whom are children. The Colombian people turn against Escobar and call for the downfall of his cartel empire. Total war has begun between Escobar's Medell√≠n Cartel and Gilberto's Cali Cartel. The Cali Cartel meets with Le√≥n (Escobar's associate from Season 1), who agrees to go into business with them, but he is killed when he is of no further use to Cali. Judy plans to seize control of the drug trade and give up her allies to the police, but is betrayed by Berna and the Cali Cartel, so she flees Colombia and becomes an informant for the C.I.A. Little by little, all of Escobar's men are hunted down and killed. After La Quica and Blackie are caught by the Search Bloc, Escobar goes on the run with Lim√≥n. They briefly stay with Abel, Escobar's estranged father. Abel tells Escobar how ashamed he is of his life of crime, so Escobar and Lim√≥n leave. In search of money, Lim√≥n steals Maritza's earnings and kills her when she threatens to turn him in for a reward. Escobar returns to Medellin with Lim√≥n and hides in a safehouse where he celebrates his 44th birthday. When Escobar tries to make contact with his family, the DEA and military track him down via radio triangulation and corner him on the rooftop. In the ensuing chase, Lim√≥n is shot as he exits through a window and Escobar is hit multiple times. His injuries are not life-threatening but Trujillo (who survived Carrillo's convoy ambush) executes him with a shot to the head. Hermilda is devastated by her son's death and Tata meets with the Cali Cartel in a desperate attempt to leave the country. Pe√±a returns to the U.S. and is asked to provide intel against the Cali Cartel.

Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of 92% positive, based on 16 critic revies: \\"Narcos' sophomore season manages to elevate the stakes to a gut-wrenching degree in what continues to be a magnificent account of Pablo Escobar's life.\\" On Metacritic, Season 2 holds a score of 76 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". IGN gave the second season a score of 7.4 out of 10 saying it \\"Good\\" and reads \\"It may go overboard with its love of Pablo Escobar, but I can't truly fault the show for taking advantage of its best performer and character ‚Äì or for scrambling to find an emotional core on a show that can feel rather clinical.\\" Season two received generally positive reviews from many media outlets. Joshua Alston of The A.V. Club lauded the performance of Moura's and said, \\"While the show never soft-pedals the havoc Escobar created, it makes him surprisingly sympathetic, thanks in part to Moura‚Äôs shrewd, affecting performance.\\" Mark A. Perigard of Boston Herald said, \\"Moura‚Äôs performance anchors this show.\\" Critic Neil Genzlinger of New York Times said, \\"Mr. Moura is inscrutably brilliant at the center of it all.\\" Writing for IndieWire, Liz Shannon Miller said, \\"The show has figured out how to balance its ostensible heroes. The buddy cop energy between Pe√±a and Murphy was one of Season 2‚Äôs most enjoyable side dishes--enough to make one hope for more.\\" The New York Posts, Robert Rorke said, \\"Without [Escobar] there‚Äôs a gaping hole. So allow yourself to be mesmerized and appalled at one of the most outrageous true crime dramas ever filmed.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of Vox said, \\"The second season of Narcos, Netflix‚Äôs historical drama about drug lord Pablo Escobar and the law enforcement officers who worked to bring him down, is a marked improvement over the first.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen also reviewed the series positively saying, \\"Where season 1 spanned 10 years, season 2 captures Escobar's last days on the loose. Each tightly packed episode moves quickly without sacrificing richness, chronicling the uneasy alliances and gross tactics employed to snare Escobar.\\" Television critic, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"What works in the early going of season two is that the fall is almost always more thrilling, if not engaging, than the buildup. Escobar senses the loss of power and Moura does some of his best work as viewers read the worry and interior thinking on his face.\\" John Anderson of Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"The sense of desperation among all the characters is heightened; the stakes are higher; the politics more sordid. Other aspects of the series, however, have remained disappointingly the same.\\" However, Writing for Collider Chris Cabin expressed that, \\"There are potent and provocative ideas that lie frustratingly dormant throughout this series, which seems to be just happy to play a competent but only occasionally compelling Michael Mann riff.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and barrel-shaped or urn-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia watsoniana is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, flaky to tessellated yellowish to brownish bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are the same shade of dull green on both sides, egg-shaped to lance-shaped long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same shade of green on both sides, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, long and wide, on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a flattened to rounded operculum with a small point in the centre. The operculum is much wider than the floral cup. Flowering has been observed in June and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped to urn-shaped or more or less cylindrical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy The large-fruited yellowjacket was first formally described in 1877 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Eucalyptus watsonianain his book Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet honours \\"Th. Wentworth Watson\\" who collected the type specimens near Wigton. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia watsoniana, publishing the change in the journal Telopea. In the same paper, Hill and Johnson described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Corymbia watsoniana subsp. capillata (Brooker & A.R.Bean) K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson has bristly late juvenile and intermediate leaves with the petiole attached to the underside of the leaf blade; * Corymbia watsoniana (F.Muell.) K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson subsp. watsoniana has late juvenile and intermediate leaves with the leaf blade tapering to the petiole.

Life Rogers was born in Oxford to James Edwin Thorold Rogers and his second wife, Ann Susannah Charlotte (). Her father was a campaigner for women's rights and later a Liberal MP.

They were also personally close; Rogers lived with her mother in a house in St Giles until her mother's death in 1899, when she moved to Museum Road. She had been a child model for Lewis Carroll in 1863. Carroll took pictures of her in costume and wrote a poem which he sent with a photograph. The poem read :::A picture, which I hope will :::B one that you will like to :::C. If your Mamma should :::D sire one like it, I could :::E sily get her one. Rogers had an offer of a university place withdrawn when it was realised that she was female. She had come top in the Oxford school examinations in 1873 and was automatically qualified for an exhibition at Balliol or Worcester College. As a consolation prize Balliol gave her volumes of Homer and her place was given to the boy who had come sixth in the tests. Rogers was able to sit examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level in 1877 and 1879, giving her the equivalent of first-class marks in Latin and Greek and in Ancient History respectively. She was not formally awarded an Oxford degree until 1920 when women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees. In 1879, with the opening of Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University opened its first halls for women students and Rogers, as the only woman with the equivalent of an Oxford University degree became a don (lecturer). In 1881 she became a Senior Tutor in Classics. Rogers joined the Association for the Education of Women in Oxford upon its formation in 1879. She was a stalwart member of the Association Committee, attending all but four committee meetings between 1879 and 1920, and eventually becoming the committee's Honorary Secretary after 1894. Vera Brittain praises her work on the committee as demonstrating her to be a \\"natural tactician.\\" She is also credited with overseeing the end of the ascendancy of the AEW over the women's colleges, which gained in independence as a result. In 1893, she was teaching Latin at Oxford High School.History, Oxford High School, Retrieved 13 November 2019 During the controversy in 1896 over whether women should be awarded degrees at Oxford, she was one of the first women to give evidence before the Hebdomadal Council on whether their exclusion from degrees had limited women's prospects in tuition.

He was born in Dinant on the 28 November 1866 the son of Alexander Royaux and Florentine Royaux (n√©e Beaulot). On 3 April 1888 he enlisted in the 10e r√©giment de ligne of the Belgian Army, and was appointed as an instructor in the regiment's school in late 1890. He entered the service of the Congo Free State on 1 September 1892 as a sergeant of Force Publique, sailing from Antwerp aboard the \\"Lulu Bohlen\\" on 6 September 1892. Congo Free State On arrival he was appointed to the Ubangi-Bomu expedition, leaving Boma on the 10 October and arriving in Zongo on 2 December where he was deputy to the Chef de Poste Heymans. Here he soon distinguished himself with his skills as an administrator and organiser. He subdued the populations of Ubangi district to the authority of the Congo Free State, being seriously wounded twice in skirmishes with the native people. Through his patience and common sense he learnt the local languages, persuading them to pay the taxes demanded by the Free State and conscripts for the Force Publique. His first term ended in August 1895 and he returned to Europe, he began his second term on 6 April 1896 when he left Antwerp to return to the Congo as a lieutenant, and then captain of the Force Publique, lasting until 9 April 1902. He was appointed area manager for Banzyville on 23 February 1897, a role he combined with those of a commander of Force Publique, a military judge in Upper Ubangi and even that of a naturalist collector. He returned to Belgium in May 1902 and was charged by King Leopold II to join an expedition to Bahr el Ghazal towards the copper mines of Hofrah-el-Nahass, which prior to the Franco-Congolese Treaty of August 14, 1894 had been explored and occupied for the Free State by Kethulle de Ryhove and Nilis as part of the Lado Enclave. He left Belgium on 2 October 1902 and arrived in Doruma on 17 January 1903. He was accompanied by his deputy, Captain Landeghem, a geological engineer, several prospectors and a military escort of two companies of Force Publique, they crossed the northern border of Congo on 2 February 1903. The expedition's vanguard, led by Landeghem, marched northwards and reached Dem Ziber - also often spelled \\"Deim Zubeir\\" - but the expedition did not go beyond that as an Anglo-Egyptian intervention ended the mission. He returned to Belgium in late December 1903, and began a career in brewing but he returned to the Congo in February 1907 to Mayumbe, as Director of the Company Urselia. He returned again for a sixth term in Kwango as a representative of the companies trading and exploiting raw rubber. First World War He was preparing for a 7th term in the Congo when the First World War broke out and Royaux, despite being too old to be called up, volunteered for service as a Captain in the Reserve. So at 48, he was appointed as commander of the 1ere compagnie of the 10e r√©giment de ligne. Present at the Siege of Namur (1914), Royaux distinguished himself in combat and was mentioned in dispatches. After the fall of Namur, he was part of the retreat to Antwerp and took part in the action which halted the German advance at the Battle of the Yser where he was praised by Lieutenant-General √âdouard Michel du Faing d'Aigremont, his divisional commander. He was promoted to captain and appointed commander Knight of the Order of Leopold. He was seriously wounded in the left arm at Diksmuide and after recuperating was promoted to Major and was appointed to command the School of Military Interpreters and the Bayeux inspection camp in Normandy. Royaux took part in the offensive to liberate Belgium as commander of the 1ere battalion of 10e regiment de ligne from 1 September 1918. On 14 October 1918, his unit surprised and captured an entire German battalion and as a result he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Post-war After the armistice which ended the war, he was part of the Army of Occupation on the Rhine. He retired on 31 December 1922 but retained interests in the industrial and commercial companies and then was chairman of the Compagnie des Caf√©s Congo Belgique. In 1933, a ceremony was held in his honor on the occasion of the laying of a commemorative plaque at his birthplace in Boisselles. He died in Mont-Saint-Jean, near Waterloo on 7 August 1936 at the age of 69. His honours included Knight of the Royal Order of the Lion, Knight of the Order of Leopold, Gold Service Star with 3 bars. Natural History legacy The Royal Sprat Microthrissa royauxi and the upside down catfish Euchilichthys royauxi were named by George Albert Boulenger in 1902 from specimens taken in the Ubangi, their specific name royauxi is in honor of Royaux who led the expedition that collected the type specimens.

Recognized as one of Norway's leading housing designers, in 1994 she was awarded the cherished Houen Foundation Award for her Stranden complex located on Oslo's Aker Brygge. Brodtkorb taught at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design in the early 1990s. Biography Born on 3 March 1942 in Oslo, Brodtkorb was the daughter of the business administrator Roald Nissen and Ragnhild Marie Heiding, a secretary. On graduating from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1965, she worked as an architect for Harald Hille's firm (1966‚Äì71) and for Anker & H√∏laas (1977‚Äì85) where she became a partner. From 1985, she ran her own firm in B√¶rum. She adopted an innovative approach to residential architecture, combining high engineering standards with distinctively attractive designs. Her developments in Oslo, in a white European modernism style, include 30 townhouses on Gullkroken, 110 apartments on Hofftunet and 60 homes in Smestad. Her masterpiece is the Stranden housing complex on Aker Brygge. Completed in 1990, it consists of 120 apartments specially designed for affluent residents. Combining brick with black-painted steel, it draws on the area's shipyard architecture while integrating offices, shops and restaurants. It has been awarded several prizes including the Houen Foundation Award. After teaching for a period at the Oslo School of Architecture in the early 1990s, she went on to design residential buildings throughout the country. Brodtkorn stands out as an outstanding female architect in a profession dominated by men. In 2014, together with Kristin Jarmund, Brodtkorb was awarded the Anders Jahres Cultural Prize for her \\"artistically sensitive designs and her contribution to promoting humane architecture in a socially developmental context\\".

This record collects 38 songs culled from the first seven seasons of the Cartoon Network series Adventure Time. Background and release On November 20, 2015, Spacelab9 released the Marceline The Vampire Queen ‚Äì Rock The Nightosphere picture disc 12-inch Mini-LP, containing the songs \\"The Fry Song\\" (from the second season episode \\"It Came from the Nightosphere\\"), \\"I'm Just Your Problem\\" (from the third season episode \\"What Was Missing\\"), \\"Journal Song\\" (from the third-season episode \\"Marceline's Closet\\"), \\"Nuts\\" (from the fourth season episode \\"I Remember You\\"), \\"Remember You\\" (also from \\"I Remember You\\"), \\"Housing Hunting Song\\" (from the first season episode \\"Evicted!\\"), and \\"Not Just Your Little Girl\\" (from the fourth-season episode \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\"); this vinyl release was exclusive to the music and clothing retailer Hot Topic. Regardless, this made it the first time that songs from Adventure Time had been commercially released. Several months later, on July 19, 2016, it was announced that Spacelab9 would once again be issuing a vinyl record containing songs from Adventure Time. However, instead of a limited 12\\" release, this record would feature over 38 tracks from the show, and would come packaged as a traditional record album. Music The record opens with the theme to Adventure Time, as performed by Ward, who is accompanied by a ukulele. The finalized version of the theme song was originally supposed to be a temporary version. Ward said, \\"I recorded the lyrics for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little crummy microphone just so that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the network. Later, we tried re-recording it and I didn't like it ... I only liked the temp one!\\" Because the series' finalized theme song was originally recorded as a temp track, ambient noises can be heard throughout. For instance, the sound of Derek Drymon typing can be heard while Jake is walking through the Ice Kingdom. The record contains only two first season songs. The first of these is \\"The Jiggler\\", taken from the episode of the same name. The song was produced by Casey James Basichis and makes heavy use of auto-tune. The final first season song, \\"The Home Song\\" (which has also been released as the \\"House Hunting Song\\") was the first musical piece produced for \\"Adventure Time\\". The song, which plays over a montage of Finn and Jake looking for a new home, was sung by Ward and Olivia Olson and features lyrics written by Ward and music by Patrick McHale. When it came time to record for the show, Ward recorded both a \\"high intensity\\" version of the song and a more subdued variant. However, Ward was dissatisfied with his version, and urged the crew to use McHale's recording in the final episode. Derek Drymon, a producer on the first season, however, urged Ward to use his own.Ward, Pendleton, et al. 2014. \\"Distant Bands: The Music of Adventure Time\\" [Featurette], Adventure Time Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Cartoon Network. In a 2016 Tumblr post, McHale explained: > When I was working on Season 1 of Adventure Time (2009? 2008?) we had to > write a montage song for the episode \\"Evicted!\\" while Finn and Jake are > looking for a new house. Pen wrote a bunch of lyrics, so I brought them home > and fine tuned them and put them to music.

Note: Information taken from Patrick McHale's > official Tumblr account. Only two songs represent the show's second season: \\"Susan Strong\\" and \\"Friends\\". \\"Friends\\", sung by BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), was taken from the episode \\"Video Makers\\", and its lyrics were written by former series storyboard revisionist David C. Smith whereas its music was composed by Tim Kiefer. Note: Information taken from the official Adventure Time Tumblr account. Eight songs on this record were taken from the show's third season, including: \\"All Gummed Up Inside\\", \\"All Warmed Up Inside\\", \\"As a Tropical Island / On a Tropical Island\\", \\"Extremities Song (Balloon Music)\\", \\"Melons (I Was Wrong)\\", \\"My Best Friends in the World\\", \\"Oh Fionna\\", and \\"Sleepy Puppies\\". \\"My Best Friends in the World\\", from the episode \\"What Was Missing\\", was written by Rebecca Sugar as a celebration of the friendship she shared with her coworkers, especially her storyboarding partner, Muto.Sugar, Rebecca (Storyboard artist). 2014. \\"What Was Missing\\" [Commentary track], Adventure Time Season Three [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Cartoon Network. Three of the songs of the record were culled from the show's fourth season: \\"Dream of Love\\", \\"Let Me Show You Something Special\\", and \\"Oh Bubblegum\\". The first, \\"Dream of Love\\", which is a duet between Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig (voiced by Ron Lynch), was taken from the eponymous episode and was written by McHale; when he was writing and recording the demo version, he envisioned Tree Trunks' part to sound like Dolly Parton, and for Mr. Pig's part to be reminiscent of Meat Loaf. \\"Let Me Show You Something Special\\" is a duet between the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny) and his monstrous creation, Princess Monster Wife (voiced in tandem by Ward, Hynden Walch, and Steve Little). The song, which was taken from the episode \\"Princess Monster Wife\\", was also written by McHale, and was inspired by the 1992 song \\"A Whole New World\\", from the animated feature film Aladdin. Note: Information taken from Patrick McHale's official Twitter account. McHale recorded a demo track of the song, featuring himself accompanied on guitar; during the recording of this demo, however, his cat kept meowing loudly. The crew found this funny, and so, in the finished episode, Gunter's cat can be heard meowing several times. Originally, it was planned for Princess Monster Wife to join in with the Ice King and sing the song as a duet. Hynden Walch actually recorded her part, and the production staff intended for Ward and Little to record their lines as well. However, in the end, the crew decided it was funnier for the Ice King to sing both parts.Muto, Adam. Spring.me. Archived from the original on September 17, 2014. Retrieved September 17, 2014. \\"They recorded takes of ['Something Special'] with Hynden Walch singing the female part of the song [...] The intention was that Steve Little and Pen would sing that part too. But it in the end, it was funnier to have Ice King do a duet with himself.\\" Note: Information taken from Adam Muto's the official Spring.me account. \\"Oh Bubblegum\\" is taken from the penultimate season four episode \\"I Remember You\\"; its lyrics were written by Cole Sanchez and Sugar, whereas its music was written solely by Sugar. Note: Information taken from Rebecca Sugar's official Tumblr account. Seven songs were selected from the show's fifth season, including: \\"Bad Little Boy\\", \\"Good Little Girl\\", \\"I Just Can't Get Over You\\", \\"Have You Ever Had a Friend\\", \\"Lemonhope's Got Feet\\", \\"Lemonhope's Song\\", and \\"Rap Bear & Finn's Rap\\". Eleven songs were selected from the show's sixth season, making it the most-represented season on the record. These songs include: \\"A Kingdom from a Spark\\", \\"Baby's Building a Tower into Space\\", \\"Everything's Falling into Place\\", \\"Food Chain Song\\", \\"Little Brothers\\", \\"Lost in the Darkness\\", \\"Money\\", \\"Prismo's Ritual\\", \\"That's All I Need\\", \\"We're Plants\\", and \\"Yeah, Girl It Stinks\\". The song \\"A Kingdom from a Spark\\", which was written by Andy Ristaino, is meant to explain the mythological origin of the Fire Kingdom via its lyrics. Note: Information taken from Andy Ristaino's official Tumblr account. The original version of the song was meant to sound more like \\"an ancient dwarven war song\\", but it was rewritten into \\"a more folksong-y version\\". Note: Information taken from Andy Ristaino's official Tumblr account. \\"Baby's Building a Tower into Space\\" was once again written by Leslie Wolfhard. Note: Information taken from Steve Wolfhard's official Tumblr account. \\"Little Brothers\\" was written by guest storyboard artist Mad√©leine Flores and her fianc√© J. Smith. According to Flores, \\"[Writing the song] was super fun because we both have little brothers, so we used them as inspiration!\\" Note: Information taken from the official Adventure Time Tumblr account. \\"Everything's Falling into Place\\", \\"Prismo's Ritual\\", and \\"Yeah, Girl It Stinks\\" were all written by Jesse Moynihan. Note: Information taken from Jesse Moynihan's official website. Note: Information taken from Jesse Moynihan's official website. The original lyrics for \\"Yeah, Girl It Stinks\\" featured the line \\"hot boxing up the palace\\", but because Cartoon Network thought it could be construed as a drug reference, the line was changed to \\"Dutch boxing\\". Note: Information taken from Jesse Moynihan's official website. \\"Lost in the Darkness\\" was written by Jesse's brother, Justin. Note: Information taken from Justin Moynihan's official website. Near the end of the record are included two versions of \\"Everything Stays\\", both of which were written by Sugar and taken from the show's seventh season. The song, which was penned several years after Sugar's departure from the series, was used prominently in the miniseries Stakes. Series storyboard artist Hanna K. Nystr√∂m revealed on Tumblr that, during the storyboarding of the episode \\"Everything Stays\\" (the second installment in the Stakes miniseries), she found herself unable to write a lullaby for the scene between Marceline and her mother. She relayed her issue to Muto, who contacted Sugar and asked if she would be willing to pen the song. Sugar agreed and based the song on an incident that occurred in her childhood. According to her, she once lost a stuffed animal in a garden. A year later, she found it; the sun had bleached the exposed surfaces, but the underside was still the same. She explained, \\"[The stuffed animal] wasn‚Äôt better, or worse, just different. It was the first time I realized that things will change no matter what, even if they‚Äôre left alone, and stay completely still.\\" Note: Information taken from Hanna K. Nystr√∂m's the official Tumblr account. Muto was excited to have Sugar return to work on the show, and noted at the 2015 Adventure Time San Diego Comic-Con International panel that \\"because [Stakes] was a Marceline miniseries, it wouldn't really feel complete unless Rebecca Sugar wrote a song for it.\\" The first version of the song on the record is a duet between Marceline and her mother, and features Sugar's vocals (as Sugar voiced Marceline's mother in the miniseries). Artwork The record itself came in three variants, which were themed after Adventure Time characters: green (\\"Tree Trunks\\"), white & blue (\\"Finn\\"), or tan (\\"Me-Mow\\"). The album cover is a picture of Finn and Jake that was designed by former lead character designer and storyboard artist Andy Ristaino for the title card of the third-season episode \\"Hitman\\". Likewise, the album's gatefold image is taken from the title card of the first-season episode \\"Tree Trunks\\", which was designed by Nick Jennings. The sleeve of the record contains notes about the songs \\"Let Me Show You Something Special\\", \\"Dream of Love\\", and \\"Bacon Pancakes\\", courtesy of Patrick McHale and Rebecca Sugar. In addition, a rainbow vinyl variant (themed after the character Lady Rainicorn) and a red variant (themed after Peppermint Butler) were released as New York Comic Con exclusives. These both feature different front and back covers, with the former being taken from the title card of the fourth season episode \\"Who Would Win?\\", and the latter being from the title card of the third-season episode \\"No One Can Hear You\\", both designed by Ristaino. The gatefold image on these variants is also different, being taken from the title card of the third-season episode \\"Wizard Battle\\". A Gunter variant has also been pressed exclusively for distribution via Hot Topic.

All recordings have been remastered by de Paul and Simon Murphy from original tape sources and co- produced by de Paul and Mark Stratford. The album is packaged with photographs and memorabilia from de Paul's personal archive and text by Michael Robson. History Disc one featured tracks from de Paul's 1975 Jet Records album, Love Bomb including the title song (which was released together with \\"Sugar Shuffle\\" in the US, and was covered by the US soul singer Cheryl Lynn on her album In Love), plus two non-album singles (\\"Rhythm and Blue Jean Baby\\" backed with \\"Into My Music\\" and \\"If I Don't Get You The Next One Will\\") plus \\"You Made Me Write This Song\\", which was the B-side to the single (and the Love Bomb album track) and has never been released before on CD. Other notable tracks include the single \\"Hug and Squeeze Me\\" and the quirky but philosophical song \\"Season To Season\\", that de Paul often played on TV shows in the mid 1970s. The second disc contains tracks from the previously unreleased third LP for Jet Records recorded in 1976 \\\\- outside of Japan, this was the first time that these songs had officially been released. Also on the second CD is \\"Rock Bottom\\", de Paul's international Eurovision hit written and performed with Mike Moran, as well as the B-side duet, \\"You Shouldn't Say That\\". The follow up 1977 non-album single, \\"You Give Me Those Feelings\\", is also included are some but not all of the songs from the Rupert Holmes produced Tigers and Fireflies album, including \\"Losin' the Blues For You\\" and \\"Melancholy Melon\\", two songs that were co-written with the US actor James Coburn and the jaunty \\"Without You\\", co-written with Mike Moran. Despite releases on vinyl, this was the first time that these songs had been released on CD. As was the case for the previous anthology double album, Sugar and Beyond, the CD comes with a booklet containing stories about the songs and de Paul's career, as well as photos and items that de Paul personally chose from her own archive. Journalist Stephen Unwin reviewed the album and gave it 4/5, writing \\"...on the barometer between Deborah Harry and Farrah Fawcett was Lynsey de Paul, a pop star who did sexy without going above the knee. She was also a formidable songwriter, a talent sometimes forgotten\\". Ian Sime writing in \\"The Press\\" gave the album a rating of 4 out of 4 stars in a review that also encompassed the Lily Allen album \\"Sheezus\\" and he stated \\"Vocally and arrangements wise, there are very close similarities to the works of Allen and De Paul. Those ethereal overdubbed harmonies are very distinctive, and copied by very few others\\". The online music magazine \\"Popshifter\\" also gave the album a positive review, along with its companion release Sugar and Beyond and mentioned de Paul as the trailblazer for Kate Bush, but also as a pioneer in her own right, since she had critical success and being a woman performing her own songs in an era when this was not common. They state that \\"the tone of de Paul's music is unique and provides a feminine tone of detachment, sexual agency, wit, and sharp observation, which are things not often seen in mainstream modern cultural ideas of femininity\\" and concluded \\"While obviously recognized at the time both by fellow musicians and critics, history is never kind to female artists in male-dominated fields. She is one of the best musicians of her genre and of mainstream British music in general\\".

Her paternal grandfather, Agustin Vicente Perez, served as Mayor of Teruel and her maternal grandfather, Juan Capo, was a highly ranked official of the Bank of Spain. Her father's family came from Teruel and her mother's from Mallorca. Her parents inspired her with their passion for art, particularly so for music. Her mother played piano and her father was passionate about opera. Likewise, she always lived surrounded by paintings, so she also adored this field of art. On a different note, she was always proud of being born on 23 April, date of Miguel de Cervantes's and William Shakespeare's death (1616), the book day and currently regional day of Aragon, on the festivity of St. George. She spent most of her childhood between 23, Paseo de la Independencia, in Zaragoza and Teruel, but with occasional trips to Madrid, Barcelona, Paris or Milan, sometimes to attend opera shows in theatres such as Barcelona's Teatro del Liceo or Milan's Alla Scala. During her infancy, she endured a long disease, which was the start of a fragile health during most of her life. During the 60s she lived in Paris, Cannes and Montecarlo.

After her husband's posting to Paris came to an end, they lived in Madrid for one year. In 1974, Fausto was posted as Spain's general consul to Liverpool, where her youngest son was born. In 1978, they moved to New Delhi. India deeply amazed Pilar de Vicente-Gella. In 1980, Fausto was posted as Spanish ambassador to Abu Dhabi.Bibliographical note in: Pilar de Vicente-Gella, A Contratiempo (Setback Against the Tide), Madrid, Torremozas, 2015. In 1982, she started the procedure to separate from her husband. In doing so, she decided to move to Madrid for a new start. On 20 January 1984 her father died, which was particularly painful for her as she considered her father to have been the person who had loved her the most in her entire life. During the following years, she lost a few more dear members of her family. On 17 July 1993, her mother died. Shortly after moving to Madrid, she started meeting the literary community of the Spanish capital. She met many artists, especially poets who lived in the capital, such as, among others, her friends Jesus Hilario Tundidor and Claudio Rodriguez, both poets from Zamora, Antonio Gonzalez Guerrero, poet from the province of Leon, and Rafael Soto Verges, yet another poet from Cadiz. She shared with all of them long evenings of literary and philosophical chats, reading one another their latest poetic compositions. In the early 2000s her health started to seriously deteriorate. On 7 October 2011, her first granddaughter was born and on 10 October 2013, her second was born. On 30 April 2016, Pilar de Vicente-Gella died in her flat, in Madrid, surrounded by her paintings, books and opera DVD's. Her funeral service was delivered at the Royal Chapel of St. Anthony of Florida, in her neighbourhood of Madrid, on 6 May 2016. Since 9 May 2016, an urn with her remains rests in her father's niche, in Teruel's municipal cemetery. Pilar de Vicente-Gella, the ballerina Although she started writing during her childhood, Pilar de Vicente-Gella's artistic passion materialized mainly through classical ballet. She started practicing in Zaragoza, in Mar√≠a de √Åvila's school. However, it was in France where she sharpened her technique, taking lessons from a true Vaganova method Russian teacher. This allowed her to join the Op√©ra de Monte- Carlo's Ballet Company during the 1967/68 season,Bibliographical note in: Pilar de Vicente Gella, A Contratiempo (Setback Against the Tide), Madrid, Torremozas, 2015. where she even shared the stage with the great Rudolf Nureyev. Yet, when she was starting to develop a professional ballet career, she chose to quit in favour of her marriage. When she returned to Spain, she taught at Spain's Performing Arts National Institute-Spanish National Ballet, starting on 1 December 1983,Performing Arts National Institute-Spanish National Ballet, December 1986 Payroll. at that time, under the direction of Maria de Avila . Following some differences between her vision and that of the National Ballet's leadership, she was no longer assigned any pupils after a few years.

Zaragoza, Ed. Heraldo de Arag√≥n, Zaragoza, 1981. During her two-year stay in New Delhi, from 1978 to 1980, she published a few articles, reports and chronicles about India's culture and social relations for the Heraldo de Arag√≥n newspaper. She also published several tales for this newspaper.Agustin Vicente Gella, As a Preface, in El Transplante y Otras Narraciones para Casi Adultos (The Transplant and Other Narrations for Almost Adults). Zaragoza, Ed. Heraldo de Arag√≥n, Zaragoza, 1981. It was this regional newspaper which released her first book: El Transplante y Otras Narraciones para Casi Adultos (The Transplant and Other Narrations for Almost Adults), in 1981. She dedicated it to her husband and to her children and her father wrote several pages As a Preface. After this first book, she wrote The Man with White Slacks in English. The book was published in the United States in 1985, with Vantage Press. Even though, up to that point, both of her released books were written in prose, the second one might be considered a transition towards her most active period, in which she focused on poetry, since The Man with White Slacks prose is more poetic than the short stories in The Transplant. She dedicated the edition to the memory of the man who showed her the way to love butterflies, her father.Pilar de Vicente-Gella, The Man With White Slacks, New York, Vantage Press, 1985. =Most productive period in poetry: 1987‚Äì2000= From 1985 on, Pilar de Vicente-Gella focused on poetry. Her first published book of poems was La Eterna Prometida (The Eternal Bride), in 1987, in the Acuario poetry collection of Andromeda Editions, which was led at that time by Leoncio Garcia-Jimenez, who also wrote its preface. The Eternal Bride's vision was to describe death as something longed for without fear, as a bride, sister, mother or lover, which makes us all equal and enables us to reach peace. It was dedicated to her mother.Pilar de Vicente-Gella, La Eterna Prometida (The Eternal Bride), Madrid, Ed. Andr√≥meda, 1987. The same year, Pilar de Vicente-Gella was selected to be included in the Voces Nuevas (New Voices) publication, by Torremozas editions, under the leadership of Luz Maria Jimenez Faro. Four poems were included in the book: Can you imagine? (¬øTe imaginas?), Incandescent Flight (Huida incandescente‚Äù), And Came the Knights (Y los jinetes llegaron) and With Ten Pigeons Did He Come (Con diez palomas vino). It was the first collaboration between the poet and the editor. They would work together several times until they both died, only about a year apart. Two years later, she released in Bilbao A Trav√©s de mi Noche (Through My Night), with the Editorial Projection Studio.Pilar de Vicente-Gella, A Trav√©s de mi Noche (Through My Night), Bilbao, Estudio de Proyecci√≥n Editorial, 1989. In 1990, Pilar de Vicente-Gella released \\"Cuarto Creciente\\" (Waxing Crescent), in the Tagore poetry collection, from Andromeda Editions, a collection led, once again, by Leoncio Garcia-Jimenez. This work is a lovers' dialogue in a garden of Al-Andalus, the Moorish Spain. For this poetic composition, the author researched and used a significant number of Spanish words with Arabic origin. The edition includes a couple of pages by Palestinian poet Mahmud Sobh \\"as a way of preface\\". She dedicates it to the memory of her uncle Fausto Vicente Gella, \\"Poet in Madrid's institutions\\" (\\"poeta del foro\\").Pilar de Vicente-Gella, \\"Cuarto Creciente\\" (Waxing Crescent), Madrid, Ed. Andr√≥meda, 1990. The book was presented on 6 June 1990, in Madrid's National Library, including Leoncio Garcia-Jimenez, Mahmud Sobh and poet and philologist Antonio Gonzalez Guerrero as participants. In 1990 and 1991, Pilar de Vicente-Gella was awarded \\"spike\\" and \\"bakery\\", respectively, in the \\"Wheat Bread\\" poetry awards of La Solana, province of Ciudad Real. In 1993, she published A orillas del Yamuna -On the Banks of the Yamuna- in New Delhi, even though she actually wrote it before The Eternal Bride,.biographical reference in Pilar de Vicente-Gella, La Eterna Prometida (The Eternal Bride), Madrid, Ed. Andr√≥meda, 1987. In this work, she expresses her fascination for India and especially for its capital city. She wrote it in Spanish and it was released in a Spanish-English bilingual edition. It was translated by Professor of Spanish, Shyama Prasad Ganguly, director and editor of the Indian Journal of Spanish & Latin American Studies. He also wrote the preface.Pilar de Vicente-Gella, A orillas del Yamuna -On the Banks of the Yamuna- bilingual version English/Spanish, New Delhi, Wiley Eastern Limited, 1993. In 1994, Pilar de Vicente-Gella won the poetry contest of the La Solana (province of Ciudad Real) Town hall. In 1995, Pilar de Vicente-Gella published \\"La Casa Abandonada\\" (The Forsaken House), with, Ed. Torremozas. In this work, the author describes her feelings when she had to pack all her parents belongings and evict the apartment in 23Paseo de la Independencia, in Zaragoza, after the passing of her mother, in July 1993.Pilar de Vicente- Gella, \\"La Casa Abandonada\\" (The Forsaken House), Madrid, Ed. Torremozas, 1995. In 1997, she won the \\"Nicolas del Hierro\\" poetry awards, by the Piedrabuena Town hall, in the province of Ciudad Real, with her book, \\"Si por mi Nombre Alguna Vez me Llamas\\" (If by My Name You Ever Call Me). The panel included Joaquin Benito de Lucas, Pedro Antonio Gonzalez Moreno, Francisco Caro Sierra and Nicolas del Hierro. Mercedes Navas Laguna served as secretary of the panel. She dedicated it to her friend and professor of art history Juan Jose Junquera.Pilar de Vicente-Gella, \\"Si por mi Nombre Alguna Vez me Llamas\\" (If by My Name You Ever Call Me), Piedrabuena (Ciudad Real), Colecci√≥n Yedra, \\"Nicol√°s del Hierro\\" poetry contest, 1997. Almost simultaneously, she won the second award in the 1997 Puente de Ventas contest with her novel \\"Por Amor a Wolfgang Amadeus\\" (For love to Wolfgang Amadeus), a narration about a divorced nurse with a sick mother, a daughter studying in London, a friendly neighbour and a lover ten years younger than her. She lives at the Donostiarra Avenue, in the Ventas del Esp√≠ritu Santo neighbourhood, likes visiting the Eva Per√≥n park and the Fuente del Berro fountain, as well as shopping at the Canillas Marketplace. However, she is now responsible for taking care of her mother and she shares her joys and hardships with Mozart. She dedicated this book to her children. The panel included Enrique de Aguinaga as chair; Luis Prados de la Plaza, Angel del Rio, Rafael Simancas, Manuel Lindo, Angel Sagredo, Juan Van- Halen, Javier Delgado, Pedro Calvo Hernando, Jose Fradejas, Valentina Gomez Mampaso and Lorenzo Lopez Sancho as members; and Vicente Diez Zazo as secretary.Pilar de Vicente-Gella, \\"Por Amor a Wolfgang Amadeus\\" (For love to Wolfgang Amadeus), Madrid, Ed. Grupo G., Second at the 1997 Puente de Ventas literary contest, 1998. In 2000, the government of the Province of Zaragoza published \\"En el Fragil Costado de la Infancia\\" (In Childhood's Fragile Side Stand). Poet Rafael Soto Verges wrote the preface for her. She dedicated it to Rosa Maria Aranda, who had also published poetry, and to Aranda's daughter, a fellow dancer in Monte Carlo in the 60s.Pilar de Vicente-Gella, \\"En el Fragil Costado de la Infancia\\" (In Childhood's Fragile Side Stand), Zaragoza, Excma. Diputaci√≥n de Zaragoza, 2000. Apart from the books that were published, during this period, she wrote many unpublished works such as, \\"Volver al Yamuna\\" (Back to the Yamuna) in poetry, and, in prose, \\"La Ni√±a Azul\\" (The Blue Girl), about her childhood memories, or \\"El Rapto\\" (The Kidknap). =Least active period: 2000‚Äì2014= After 2000, her literary work progressively lost momentum, as her health also deteriorated. On 23 April 2003, Pilar de Vicente- Gella participated in Arco Poetico, hosted by Jesus de la Pe√±a.Jesus de la Pe√±a, presentation about Pilar de Vicente-Gella; She took about six years to prepare her following published book, \\"Requiem de Julio\\" (Requiem of July), released by the Torremozas collection in 2006. The main feature of this work is its duality between, on the one hand, the grievance brought about by the death of her friend, poet from Zamora Claudio Rodriguez, in 1999, and, on the other, the mixed feelings coming from finding a close friend from the 80s in Abu Dhabi again, two different things that occurred simultaneously.Pilar de Vicente-Gella, \\"Requiem de Julio\\" (Requiem of July), Editorial Torremozas, 2006. She dedicated the book to the poet and to his widow. However, this volume brought to her much unrest since she heard rumours indicating that many readers, including the poets widow herself, misunderstood completely the duality in the book. As a consequence, it took her about eight years to find the necessary motivation to write again. =Final stand: 2014‚Äì2016= In March 2015, she published \\"Tornaviaje\\" (Return) with the Torremozas collection. She dedicated it to her late elder brother, Agustin, to whom she had been very attached during her childhood. \\"Tornaviaje\\" also describes how the author managed to get over the sadness that the misunderstandings about her previous book had caused her. It was the last book that Luz Maria Jim√©nez Faro sent to press and the first that was actually released after her death. The passing away of her mother's best friend, Enriqueta Castejon, led Pilar de Vicente- Gella to resume writing and return to square one. In fact, the original title in Spanish, \\"Tornaviaje\\" comes from explorer Andr√©s de Urdaneta, known for discovering and documenting the Pacific Ocean route between the Philippines and Acapulco, known as the Urdaneta route or Tornaviaje, in Spanish.Manuel Lopez Azorin, Critic of Return, Madrid, Editorial Torremozas, 2015; In a way, it means coming back to the starting point but through a different and enlightening route. In December 2015, she published \\"A Contratiempo\\" (A Setback Against The Tide), with Torremozas, her last book and the first one in a new literary genre: aphorisms. She dedicated it to her two granddaughters, whom she nicknamed Michmich and Bibich, apricot and fawn in Arabic. It was composed as a compendium of her life philosophy which, at the same time, she hoped would guide her granddaughters through their teenage years in the future. On 30 April 2016, she passed away in her residence in Madrid, while she was working on a second volume of \\"A Contratiempo\\".

History John Swinney MSP introduced the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill to Parliament on 27 March 2013, supported by Paul Wheelhouse MSP and Fergus Ewing MSP. It passed through the various stages in Parliament between November 2013 and January 2014 and received Royal Assent on 19 February 2014, with Part 5 of the Act (excluding section 57) coming into force the following day. The legislation allowed for the remainder of the Act to come into force on a future date at the will of the Scottish Ministers. The Act arose from recommendations made to the Government by the Environmental Crime Task Force. Regulatory changes The Act attempts to make it easier for businesses to apply for certain permits and licences in Scotland, while strengthening environmental regulations to protect the country's natural heritage. Businesses will be able to apply for a single permit for a site where several would have been required previously. In addition, it gives courts additional sentencing powers in relation to environmental crime and give the Scottish Environment Protection Agency more powers to enforce laws.

Engelhard-Reyher, Gotha 1937, S. 227 f.) was a German author and founder of the Deutschen Pfadfinderbundes f√ºr junge M√§dchen. On January 14, 1912, the Deutschen Pfadfinderbundes f√ºr junge M√§dchen was founded at the instigation of Maximilian Bayer, in which several Scout groups existent since 1908, some of which previously were attached to the Wandervogel, merged. Hopffgarten was elected by the Assembly in the Pestalozzi-Fr√∂bel-Haus to be the first chairman and held that position until 1922. In this role, she was editor of the club magazine and made numerous lecture tours around Germany, to promote Scouting. By mid-1914, the organization had 6,200 members. In 1915 the organization launched the Kriegsgarten \\"war gardens\\", in which children were taught horticulture and were fed.

The son of religious refugees that brought him from Sweden to the United States, he fought in the American Civil War as a volunteer officer, graduated from West Point at the top of his class, served his adopted country with distinction as an officer of the regular army, a professor of his Alma Mater, and a Western explorer, and married a cousin of the wife of president Rutherford B. Hayes. Early life Bergland was the son of Anders Olsson Berglund, a farmer who became a follower of the charismatic revivalist Eric Jansson, whose teachings brought him and his followers into a fierce conflict with the Lutheran Established Church of Sweden. The government persecuted Jansson and his followers, and they decided in 1847 to emigrate to the United States, in search of religious freedom. Anders Berglund and his family, including the three year-old Erik, followed their fellow believers to Illinois, where they participated in the creation of the Bishop Hill Colony. After the murder of Eric Jansson, his father broke with his old faith, becoming a preacher in the local Methodist Church.Olsson & Wik√©n 1995, p. 299. At the age of 12 Bergland became an apprentice in the printing office of the Swedish language paper Svenska Republikanaren in Galva. When the paper was moved to Chicago, the Bishop Hill Colony, who owned the printing press, made him manager of the office that remained in Galva.Johnson & Peterson 1880, pp. 301-302. Civil War When the American Civil War began, the Bishop Hill Colony raised a volunteer company, and offered it to United States service. The company became Company D, 57th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and Bergland, although only 17 years old, was elected Second Lieutenant. He fought at the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh, First and Second Corinth, and Resaca, and was promoted to First Lieutenant after Shiloh. In the fall of 1864, Bergland received an appointment to West Point. He took an extension on the appointment, remained on the rolls of the regiment, but served as a military engineer in Ohio till the end of the war.Johnson & Peterson 1880, pp. 55-58.Cluett 1886, p. 121.\\"Obituary of Eric Bergland\\", Annual Report, 1919, pp. 137-138.Kastrup 1975, p. 284. Military career Bergland graduated from West Point in 1869, at the top of his class. His place on the graduation list would have given him a commission in the Corps of Engineers, but all the billets were full, and he became a Second Lieutenant in the 5th Artillery. While at this regiment, he participated in the 1870 U.S. Army intervention to prevent Fenian raids into Canada. Two years later he was transferred to the Engineers as a First Lieutenant. Bergland served between 1873 and 1883 several periods at West Point as instructor and professor, only interrupted by three years on Western exploration under George Wheeler, 1875-1878. During these three years he travelled over 2,000 miles on mules and on foot, surveying in California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado. Promoted to Captain in 1884, he served on a variety of engineering posts in Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, as well as company commander, and instructor at the Corp's School of Application. The last years of his military career Bergland spent as a lighthouse engineer. He was promoted to Major in 1895, and retired a year later. In his retirement, the family lived in Baltimore.Heitman 1903, vol. 1, p. 213.Bartlett 1962, p. 353. Family Life Bergland married Lucy Scott McFarland in 1878. She was a cousin of president Rutherford B. Hayes wife Lucy Webb Hayes. They had four children, John, Eric, William, and Mary Brita.Princeton Alumni Weekly, Jan. 25, 1954, p. 25.

In geomorphology a nubbin is a small and gentle hill consisting of a bedrock core dotted with rounded residual blocks. The blocks derive from disintegrated and weathered bedrock layers. In particular it is assumed that the boulders of the nubbins are the remnants of the outer one or two exfoliation shells that weathered underground, albeit some weathering can continue to occur once the boulders are exposed on surface. Nubbins form in a similar way to castle koppies and bornhardts and the three landforms can be seen as different expressions of the same phenomena. Nubbins occur often in patterned groups. Nubbins can be found in humid tropical and monsoon climate areas. According to geomorphologist C.R. Twidale this is the environment where most nubbins form. Nubbins outside the humid or seasonally-humid tropics are relict landforms formed in a humid and tropical past or form in areas of high subsurface humidity. Examples of localities with nubbins include Southwestern United States, the MacDonnell Ranges in Central Australia and Namaqualand in Southern Africa.

Established in 1949, it was equivalent to the Federal Border Guards (Bundesgrenzschutz, BGS) in West Germany and the Baracked People¬¥s Police (Kasernierte Volkspolizei, KVP) in East Germany. History After the defeat of the Third Reich, the reinstated Austrian government wanted the country to be able to defend itself and to be able to take care of its own security. After initial skepticism, the allied Western powers also showed interest in this project. In particular, the communist takeover of power in Budapest in 1947 and Prague in the following year caused this rethinking. Since all four occupying powers, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States had decided in 1945 to forbid any military activity in Austria, the Western Allies decided to allow the Austrian government to establish a paramilitary branch of the existing Gendarmerie. The formation of the B-Gendarmerie was primarily driven by the then Minister of the Interior, Oskar Helmer, and then Secretary of State and later Minister of Defense Ferdinand Graf. From 1949 onwards, the already existing alarm groups of the gendarmerie have been separated into independent alarm units, which were internally called B-Gendarmerie. They were intended to be a special unit of the gendarmerie and had the mission of dealing with extraordinary events such as illegal border crossings, internal disturbances or actions of subversive forces. The alarm units were primarily equipped with American weapons and equipment. The gendarmes, trained for military training, were now trained in the Gendarmerie schools, which, due to the secret character of the entire B-Gendarmerie, was also associated with problems such as recruitment. The Western occupying powers, that supported the entire project, had all information about secret recruitment lists and plans of the Austrians. The company, which was also designated as a gendarmerie special program, provided for the admission of former military officers knowledge in order to be able to dispose of them in wartime. By 1954 about 90,000 men have been registered. There were also plans for the soldiers of the B-Gendarmerie to be brought abroad, especially to Italy or North Africa, in the event of a communist coup, and to form an Austrian exile military force. In November 1954 it pointed out, that the Soviet Union was well informed about the activities of the B-Gendarmerie. However, this did not have any consequences since, the Soviet Union was now interested in a united neutral Austria due to the geopolitical situation. In 1950, the first permanent units were built. In each of the three western occupation zones one battalion, all under the cover of the gendarmerie academies have been built up. The beginning of the B-Gendarmerie can be fixed with the 1 August 1952 under the training and supervision of former Wehrmacht officers. The new formation was directly subordinated to the Federal Ministry of the Interior. The respective local governments were responsible for the administration. On 28 October 1953, a separate department for the B-Gendarmerie was created in the Ministry of the Interior, whereby it was completely separated from the civilian government. At the end of 1953, the B-Gendarmerie consisted of about 100 officers and 4,000 men. As a result, up to 1955 a total of 10 gendarmerie schools, two other driving units, a department D - a supply camp jointly run with the Americans, and a department K (K for courses (Kurs) in German) to take over the training of future officers, as well as two so-called telegraph schools. In 1954, the B-gendarmerie officially designated not only the protection of the frontier and the fight against unrest, but also the use of natural catastrophes and so- called tactical operations in the event of a war effort. The fear of war was not unfounded: the East-West conflict had developed into the Cold War, and the war in Korea (1950‚Äì1953), which, like Austria and Germany after the Second World War, became a western and an eastern one Zone of occupation was seen as a proxy war, as it might also arise in other conflict zones. Meaning of \\"B\\" in B-Gendarmerie Since the B-gendarmerie built up until 1949, it was a secret unit. The exact meaning of the word B-Gendarmerie or of \\"B-\\" is not clarified. Some sources speak of \\"stand-by\\" gendarmerie, in German Bereitschaftsgendarmerie, others of \\"B-\\" as an addition to the \\"normal\\" \\"A-\\" gendarmerie. It is also assumed that the \\"B-\\" might stand for special, in German besondere Gendarmerie. However, during the period of the formation of the B-Gendarmerie no military organization was officially recognized by the Allies, the name B-gendarmerie is to be understood as a camouflage.

Its molecular formula is C22H40O7.  Chemical properties  Agaric acid, as any other fatty acid, has an amphipathic character. It means that it has both polar (hydroxyl groups) and apolar (hydrocarbon chain) sections, and therefore, it is not completely water- soluble. It is a tribasic acid, and therefore, it can donate up to 3 hydrogen ions to other bases in an acid-base reaction. Another example of tribasic acids is phosphoric acid or citric acid. It is an odorless and tasteless acid, and we can also distinguish it by its white color. Its melting point at atmospheric pressure is 140 ¬∞C.  Molecular structure  Agaric acid is a type of fatty acid that is composed by a long hydrocarbon chain (\\"tail\\") and three carboxylic acid groups at one end (\\"head\\"). The hydrocarbon chain has sixteen carbons and thirty four hydrogens. This acid has microcrystalline properties, and therefore, forms small crystals that can not be seen through the naked eye, but are only visible with an optical microscope.  Functions  Agaric acid is used as an inhibitor of metabolism in several animal experiments. It is shown that this acid prevents the formation of C2 units from citrate and reduces the availability of citrate for the activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Moreover, it has an important role in the metabolism of lipids, because it influences sterol synthesis. Agaric acid induces the mitochondrial permeability transition by collaborating with adenine nucleotide translocase. It facilitates the efflux of accumulated Ca2+, disrupts the potential of the membrane and causes mitochondrial lumps. All of these effects bet on membrane fluidity. It's thought that agaric acid activates the opening of membrane pores due to the union of citrate to ADP transporters. However, a later research showed that N-ethylmaleimide inhibits carboxyatractyloside and agaric acid effects. It was found that this amine restricts the pore opening action of agaric acid, but it does not affect the constraint of ADP exchange by agaric acid.  Medical use  Agaric acid is used in medicine as an anhidrotic agent in order to stop excessive perspiration as it paralyses the nerve terminations in the human body's sweat glands. For example, it helps to avoid tuberculosis patients' frequent night sweats. In addition, when taken in doses from 5 to 15 grams, agaric acid produces vomiting in humans. In the past, agaric acid was used as an irritant, an antidiarrhoeal and a bronchial secretions reducer. = Other uses = Physicians use agaric acid, but it also can be used in many other subjects such as veterinary and biochemistry. In lower animals, this substance depresses the nervous, respiratory and circulatory systems. It has been used as a metabolic inhibitor at the cellular and subcellular level in scientific animal experiments. Agaric acid has also been used as an alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor in Crithidia fasciculata, which is a species of parasitic protist.

The first years of the newly formed Bund were marked by a recurring conflict about the orientation, between the \\"old\\" members that were active before World War I, and the \\"new\\" ones. While the old leading members almost all served in the German military during the war and wanted to rebuild the Pfadfinderbund in its old form, the new, progressive powers leaned more towards the Wandervogel as being more back-to-nature orientated and less nationalistic. This two main factions were the \\"jungdeutschen\\" (young German) and the \\"neudeutschen\\" (new German) Scouts. The latter adopted the so-called Prunner Gel√∂bnis (Vow of Prunn) in 1919, which became the German Scouts' epigraph. The first \\"Reichsfeldmeister\\" (fieldleader of the realm) after the war was Carl Freiherr von Seckendorff, chosen in Eisenach in 1919. While von Seckendorff was of the old leadership generation, both Scouting factions remained in the union.

She was Ernest Hemingway's mother. Early life Grace and Ernest Hall, c 1895 Grace Ernestine Hall was born on June 15, 1872 in Chicago. She was the daughter of wealthy merchant Ernest Miller Hall (1840‚Äî1905) and Caroline Hancock (1843‚Äî1895), both natives of England. A younger brother, Leicester, was born in 1874. Hall studied the violin, piano and took voice lessons when she was young. In 1886, her family moved to Oak Park, where she attended Oak Park High School and first encountered her future husband, Clarence Edmonds 'Ed' Hemingway (1871‚Äî1928). In 1889, Caroline and Ernest Hall purchased a lot on North Oak Park Avenue. While living in a rental house nearby, the couple supervised construction of their new home, designed by architect Wesley Arnold. The Hall house was completed in 1890 and located at 449 Oak Park Avenue The Victorian 3-story house, just across the street from the Hemingway family house, consisted of first and second floors with six bedrooms and a bathroom. Their home had running water and was the first house in Oak Park to have electricity. Hall and Clarence Hemingway became close friends during her mother's illness from cancer in 1894. Hemingway was the new medical assistant to the Hall's family doctor, Dr. William Lewis, and made frequent house calls to visit Caroline Hall, during which he was a source of emotional support for Grace as her mother's health deteriorated. Caroline Hall died on September 5, 1895. By then, Hall and Hemingway's friendship had grown into a romantic relationship. In the fall of 1895, Hall went to New York City to study with Luiza Cappiani‚Äîa well-known opera coach‚Äîand, in 1896, she debuted as a talented contralto with the Apollo-Club in Madison Square Garden. She was later offered a contract by the Metropolitan Opera but turned it down for two reasons: her eyes, weakened from a childhood illness, could not tolerate the bright stage lighting, and she was also greatly influenced by Hemingway's many letters, imploring her to return to Oak Park. Family and career Ernest and Grace Hemingway, 1899 On October 1, 1896, Hall married Clarence Hemingway. The couple moved into Ernest Hall's large home. At the time of her marriage, Hall Hemingway had over fifty voice pupils and gave music and voice lessons, wrote sheet music, and directed the children's church choir and the orchestra at the First Congregational Church of Oak Park. She also sang in concerts and was a soloist with the church choir. She earned quite a bit more money from her music lessons than her husband did as a doctor. According to her daughter, Marcelline, she was earning up to $1000 a month at one point, while her husband, just starting out in his profession, was bringing in $50 a month. The Hall house is the birthplace of the three oldest Hemingway children: Marcelline in 1898, Ernest in 1899, and Ursula in 1902. Madelaine (Sunny) was born in 1904 at their Walloon Lake cottage in Michigan. All the Hemingway children were delivered by their father. Their mother did not participate in the domestic chores in the Hemingway household but their father often cooked, planned meals, helped with laundry and did seasonal canning. Live-in maids and nannies performed most of the housekeeping, cooking and care of the children. The Hemingway family, 1900 Hall Hemingway focused her maternal energy on encouraging and inspiring her children in the cultural world of literature, art, poetry and music. She read hundreds of books to her children when they were young, and taught them songs and poetry. She took her children to the opera, theater, and museums in nearby Chicago. She insisted that all of her children learn to play a musical instrument. The girls were encouraged to play the violin and piano, and Ernest was assigned the cello. The Hemingway family would spend their summers at their family cottage in Walloon Lake, Michigan. Their father was an excellent outdoorsman who introduced the Hemingway children to swimming, camping, fishing, hiking, and hunting. Their mother enjoyed their summer trips, was often outdoors with the family, and was comfortable using both a fishing pole and a rifle. She would later design and have built a small cottage across the lake from the main cottage. She often would row herself from the large family cottage to the smaller cottage to spend a few quiet days on her own. Ernest's grandfather died in May 1905, leaving his home to his daughter, Grace. By October, she had sold the house to Samuel Nissen, an Oak Park grocer. She bought a lot on Kenilworth avenue and made sketches for a new, much larger house. With those sketches, the architect designed a three-story, eight- bedroom stucco home for the family, with a large music studio for herself and an office for her husband to see medical patients. Their last two children were born at the new house: Carol in 1911 and Leicester in 1915, when she was forty-two years old. Grace and Ernest The Hemingway family, c 1915 Ernest Hemingway had a difficult relationship with his mother, beginning in his teen years. She asserted her authority over every Hemingway family member, including her husband. She put many demands on her children, insisting they participate in activities that were important to her. As Ernest matured as a young man, he often chafed under her rules, intent on exploring sports, hobbies and activities that interested him. He started refusing to do as she bid, which caused a lot of conflict between mother and son. Furthermore, Clarence was often away from home, for long periods of time, and his depression caused him to withdraw from the family, which made things even more difficult for Ernest during his teens. Writers, historians, and Ernest's friends have discussed his difficult relationship with his mother at length. Bernice Kert states: \\"It has also been said that Ernest's lifelong assertion of masculine power grew out of his emotional need to exorcise the painful memory of his mother asserting her superiority over his father.\\" Major General Charles Lanham, a friend of Ernest's, said that he was the only man he ever knew who really hated his mother. Later years Hall Hemingway was an active member of the Suburban Civics and Equal Suffrage Club in Oak Park, during the era of the New Woman movement (1890-1920), with women's suffrage as a national issue. In 1924, at the age of 52, she began to paint and attended classes at the Art Institute of Chicago and other art schools. She studied art for two years. In an interview in the April 1937 issue of Artistry Magazine, she claimed to have painted over 600 pictures, mainly landscapes. Hall Hemingway belonged to the Oak Park Art League, serving as its director for six years. Clarence Hemingway suffered from deteriorating health in the 1920s, both physical and mental. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1928. Ernest blamed his mother for his death. According to author John Raeburn, \\"In the Hemingway household, her imperious presence and propensity for self- dramatization contrasted with her husband's irritable remoteness. Ernest, frightened by his father's bewildering behavior, identified its cause as his mother's overbearingness. That was unjust, but he never relinquished the conviction, and it echoed in several of his stories.\\" Hall Hemingway was fifty-six at the time of her husband's death, but still had two children to support and educate, Carol and Leicester. She rented out part of her home to help pay for Carol's education. Ernest and his second wife, Pauline, set up a trust fund for his mother to help support her for the remainder of her life. In gratitude for his generosity, she deeded the family's summer cottage to Ernest. Learning to drive for the first time, Hall Hemingway took driving trips to Florida, to sketch and paint. She sold her large home in 1936 and moved into a smaller home in the nearby village of River Forest. She carried on painting and began teaching painting lessons, while still teaching voice lessons for several years. Hall Hemingway lived for twenty-three years on her own after her husband's death. She died in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1951. Notes  References   Sources  = Books =  * = Websites = * *  Further reading   * *  External links  * * .

Hillyer had opened an investment account with $800,000 to finance the project; the account grew to $2.5 million. She was fortunate enough to withdraw the money just before Wall Street Crash of 1929. The hall opened in January 1930. Hillyer was too ill to attend the opening of the Horace Bushnell Memorial Hall in 1930 and died two years later. In 2003, she was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame.

Following a string of odd jobs after graduation, he is offered a job at a webzine, Neon Circus, on the basis of a joke obituary he wrote for an actor who died of a drug overdose. The editor of Neon Circus, Jeroma Whitfield, gives him the obituaries column. After Whitfield denies him a raise, Michael writes her obituary as a way to vent his frustration. A colleague later calls him at home to tell him that Whitfield is dead. He tries to rationalize it as a coincidence, but when he writes another obituary for a living person, it becomes clear that he actually has a power. The power becomes like an addiction. With each use, Michael feels a stronger compulsion to use the power again. Eventually he finds that he can kill not just specific individuals, but simultaneously anyone who shares the same name.

He was a founding member of the pop group The Critters singing their biggest hits \\"Younger Girl\\" and \\"Mr. Dieingly Sad\\". The latter he wrote about his girlfriend Kathy Cobb before he entered the Air Force during the time of the Vietnam War. Kathy later became his wife. When The Critters's first album started to take off, Don was in the Air Force and the band had to tour without him which is why many videos on YouTube do not feature him. Ken Gorka is lip syncing Don's part. Ciccone was born in Jersey City, New Jersey on February 28, 1946. He was the son of an immigrant father, Vito Ciccone, who owned and operated Bill Williams Auto Sales in the 1950s. From the age of 5, Don grew up in a 56-room mansion in Plainfield, New Jersey. In the 1970s, Don Ciccone joined the Four Seasons, where he played guitar and bass and also contributed lead vocals to songs including \\"December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\\" and \\"Rhapsody.\\" After the Seasons, he joined Tommy James and the Shondells as their bassist, through 1987. During his time with the Critters, he wrote \\"Mr. Dieingly Sad\\", produced by Artie Ripp, which reached #17 for the group. He also wrote and recorded \\"There's Got to be a Word\\" which was later recorded and released by the Innocence in December 1966. Their version reached #34 on the charts.

The four song EP was released on 22 June 2009. While initial sales were low, its release, coupled with subsequent touring, is credited with getting them the positions of opening live shows for Bon Jovi and Guns N' Roses that are credited for kick-starting the band's music career.  Background and recording  While members of the band had been together dating back to 2003, during these years, they were more identified as just a number of musicians who shared a similar passion for music in the same London underground music scene, and did not form as a serious band until 2008. The band's lineup, upon becoming a formal band, consisted of Gustav Wood as the lead vocalist, Frasier and John Taylor both as guitarists, Simon Mitchell as the bassist, and Ben Jolliffe on drums. The band began playing local live shows at bars and small events featuring music from a variety of different music genre. They eventually began to garner more attention by securing spots in support of post-hardcore bands Funeral for a Friend and We Are the Ocean. This exposure granted them the opportunity to work with Dan Weller and Justin Hill, from the influential progressive metal band Sikth, as producers.  Themes and composition  While the band's initial touring and producers were more related to the hardcore and progressive metal music scenes, the band chose to pursue a more straightforward, melodic rock sound with the EP.  Release, promotion, and aftermath  The EP was released on 22 June 2009. A single to promote the release, \\"In the Night\\", was also released in the same month. The EP was not an immediate success, selling only 500 copies in its opening week, but the band continued to push forward with extensive touring. The band's EP and touring in support of it eventually caught the attention of popular Welsh rock band Lostprophets, who then asked the band Young Guns to open for them. This greatly raised the band's profile, which in turn lead to opening for Bon Jovi at their residency at The O2 Arena, and Guns N' Roses at that year's Reading Festival. The track \\"Weight of the World\\" was later released on the band's debut album All Our Kings Are Dead in 2010.  Critical reception  The EP received mixed reviews from critics, who often conceded that the release at least showed the band's potential. Rock Sound gave the EP a mixed review, describing it as \\"Not hugely original but not totally generic either\\", and that there were \\"some mighty rock riffs\\" but that they \\"don‚Äôt explode enough to officially make them stadium-worthy\\". The publication concluded that the EP was \\"Not ear-shattering just yet but with potential...Rock Sound is excited to hear what‚Äôs yet to come.\\" The AU Review was more positive about the release, praising how the band was able to \\"squeeze in everything that makes them so great\\" in what was only a four song release. The review concluded with declaring the EP being a success in introducing listeners to the band, with the release being \\"an instantly captivating work\\", but that they'd \\"expect bigger and greater things from the band\\" in future releases. The Alter the Press review echoed similar sentiments of the release showing potential for the future, concluding that \\"Mirrors is a strong debut from a band with plenty of potential, however it's definitely a grower, especially if you are not a big fan of the style of music Young Guns play. Nevertheless the blend of heavy riffs and strong melodies are a good combination and Young Guns could have a winning formula.\\" The EP's release lead to the band winning Kerrang magazine's \\"Best Newcomer Award\\" for 2009.

He served with the colonial service in Algeria and travelled in the Congo and Ubangi region. While attempting to find a viable land route from the Congo to the Mediterranean via Chad he was taken prisoner by Rabih az-Zubayr and hanged. Early years Jean Jacques Marie Ferdinand de B√©hagle was born in Ruffec, Charente on 18 July 1857. He became an officer of the merchant marine. He was then employed as administrator of mixed communes in Algeria. He served in Algeria from 1885 to 1891. On 15 September 1885 he married Rosine Dehoux in B√¥ne, Algeria. In 1892, de B√©hagle was a volunteer member of the exploratory expedition organized by Casimir Maistre, Fran√ßois Joseph Clozel and Albert Bonnel de M√©zi√®res that followed the expedition of Paul Crampel. The mission ascended the Congo River, then the Ubangi River, and explored the divide between the Chad and Congo Basins. After his return, between 1893 and 1897, de B√©hagle published a number of papers on the French colonization of Africa. He was an erudite man. De B√©hagle and Paul Bourdarie (1864‚Äì1950) made speeches to the Soci√©t√© africaine de France in which they stressed the importance of the French colonists making a military \\"association\\" with the natives for defense of the colonies. Expedition to Bornu Plate from B√©hagle's 1896 Voyage commercial et scientifique au bassin du Tchad, Afrique centrale During the 1890s the Sudanese warlord Rabih az- Zubayr was actively expanding his power in the former Bornu Empire around Lake Chad. He built a fortress at Dikoa, to the south of Lake Chad, and attempted to obtain munitions to modernise his army from the British Royal Niger Company. The French officer √âmile Gentil reached the Chari River from the Congo in 1897, and learned that Rabih az-Zubayr had been responsible for the death of Paul Crampel. Gentil signed a protectorate treaty with Gaorang, Sultan of Bagirmi to the southeast of Lake Chad. Bonnel de M√©zi√®res engaged de B√©hagle for his Paris-based Syndicat commercial fran√ßais des bassin do Tchad et de l'Oubangui (SCFBTO). De B√©hagle was asked to find an economically viable land route via Chad from the Congo to the Mediterranean Sea. In 1898, de B√©hagle and Toussaint Mercuri (1871‚Äì1902) left Bangui, now in the Central African Republic, destined for Chad. De B√©hagle explored the Tomi and Gribingui rivers, and found their sources. He met Sultan Gaorang in Kouno in July 1898. Rabih az-Zubayr now had an army of 10,000 men. He had imposed a dictatorship on the old Bornu empire, made the sultans his vassals and imposed a law based on the Sharia. De B√©hagle was received by Rabih at Dikoa on 14 March 1899. At first, he was treated well, but the two men soon quarrelled. Rabih wanted to buy de B√©hagle's rifles, and when he refused, threw him in prison. Death and legacy In 1898, √âmile Gentil had been given command of a new French mission to oppose Rabih in Bagirmi. Henri Bretonnet was sent ahead with an advance party to rescue de B√©hagle, and was met by Rabih on the Chari. The battle of Togbao took place on 17 July 1899 on the banks of the Chari about north of Fort Archambault (Sarh). Bretonnet and most of his men were killed. Rabih ordered the execution of de B√©hagle on 15 October 1899. De B√©hagle was hung and his body was thrown in a pit. The incident made war between France and Rabih inevitable. De B√©hagle's body was recovered in 1901 by troops of colonel Georges Destenave, and buried at Fort Lamy (N'Djamena). The rue Ferdinand-de-B√©hagle was opened in Paris in 1932 in the 12th arrondissement near the Museum of African and Oceanic Arts, and was named after the explorer on 3 February 1936.
