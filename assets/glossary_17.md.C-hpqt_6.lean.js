The main concept behind the software is separation of domain and HPC knowledge and leaving each part to the respective experts while the GPI-Space as framework integrates both parts together. GPI-Space is making use of GPI to solve big data problems more efficient than current solutions. GPI-Space was first introduced in a domain-specific version for geology, under the name SDPA (Seismic Development and Programming Architecture) at SEG 2010 in Houston. Core layers GPI- Space Core Layers GPI Space comes with several layers, that make up the core of the parallel programming development software. =Runtime engine= The runtime engine is responsible to distribute the available jobs across the available systems. In a large scale HPC clusters, these can be heterogeneous and consist of traditional compute nodes as well as nodes with accelerator cards, such as GPUs or Intel's Xeon Phi. Besides the mere scheduling and distribution of jobs, the runtime engine is also adding fault-tolerance. Jobs are monitored after they have been assigned and reassigned to different resources, in case the initially assigned hardware fails. New hardware can be added dynamically. =Workflow engine= The workflow engine translates instructions from an existing workflow in XML format with special GPI-Space tags into the runtime environments internal instructions which are based on Petri nets. Workflows can be arbitrary modular and use other workflows as elements, thus allowing users to predefine building blocks once and then use them in future, more complicated workflows. A graphical editor for workflows is available. =Autoparallelization engine= GPI Architecture The autoparallelization engine decides about how to ideally execute code that is fed into the system in parallel. This relieves domain programmers from the need for parallelizing their own code and leaves them focusing on their domain. HPC knowledge and experience by Fraunhofer ITWM's Competence-Center High-Performance Computing (CC-HPC) is an essential contributor to the engine's capability of generating highly optimal parallel codes. =Virtual memory layer= All computation with GPI-Space can be done using a fast parallel file system, such as BeeGFS, which is very similar to other Big Data solutions available. But beyond this, GPI-Space is capable of doing all computation in memory, as well, thus omitting the higher latencies and performance bottlenecks of traditional I/O. Using Fraunhofer GPI (see also graphic \\"GPI Architecture\\"), one big block of a partitioned global address space is dynamically allocated. The RDMA capability allows for fast, single sided communication. Disk transfers to and from the virtual memory are completely asynchronous and hidden behind computation. Seismic Development and Programming Architecture (SDPA) The GPI-Space core plus the domain specific HPC-modules for seismic make up SDPA to execute user codes. To showcase the validity of the GPI-Space approach, Fraunhofer first introduced it as part of the Seismic Development and Programming Architecture (SDPA) during SEG 2010 in Houston, TX to the community. In the seismic domain exist countless legacy algorithms and codes in a variety of programming languages that have been developed over years, but that are not parallelized. Due to limited resources, it is often not feasible to rewrite those codes from scratch in a parallel version and one single programming language. Developers at the CC-HPC have put together domain specific solutions for seismic data that includes: * highly optimized algorithms for parallel I/O, * fault tolerance, * parallelization patterns for seismic data, such as traces, gathers (which consist of several traces), or stacks which enable the autoparallelization engine to work efficiently, and * general data management routines to handle seismic data. In addition, there is a set of basic workflows that can be used as building blocks for more sophisticated workflows by the end user. All these components solve the parallelization problem for the seismic domain, so the domain developer can focus on his problem, without having to deal with it. An end user of SDPA can then simply execute existing legacy codes and modules in any language in parallel with SDPA, reducing turnover time for projects significantly. SDPA is also used as a fast way to prototype new ideas and algorithms for parallel execution. SDPA is used by several of Fraunhofer's industry partners in a production environment.

It is one of the first programs worldwide to integrate massive open online courses (MOOCs), flip teaching, and other education technology practices into a blended learning curriculum, with the goal of lowering the cost of higher education without a reduction in academic quality or outcomes. All graduates of the program receive an accredited U.S. degree through the competency-based College for America at Southern New Hampshire University. Kepler is funded primarily through a grant from the IKEA Foundation. In October 2017 Daniel Gwinnell joined the organization as its CEO. History Kepler is being incubated within Generation Rwanda, a non- governmental organization founded in 2004. Its aim is to provide scholarships to local universities to Rwanda’s highest achieving secondary school graduates that could not otherwise afford higher education. The organization claims to have a 98% graduation rate as well as a 98% employment rate—outcomes far higher than the regional average. In 2013, Kepler ran its first pilot program, using a University of Edinburgh course through Coursera. In 2013, 50 students were chosen from 2,696 applicants and enrolled in the founding class. In 2014, another class of 100 students was selected, following a series of tests and interviews. In 2015, Kepler opened up a second site at the UNHCR's Kiziba Refugee Camp in Rwanda's Western Province with the goal of providing access to higher education to refugees. Function Kepler operates an experimental university campus in Kigali, Rwanda that combines online courses with in- person facilitation and career training. They employ no faculty, opting to use MOOCs and other online resources for expert-level content, while retaining teaching experts to support student learning. Kepler’s Teaching Fellows are a mix of international educators and local Rwandan teachers. According to its website, Kepler’s goal is “to create a global network of universities that deliver the skills that emerging economies need for a price that [its] students can afford.” In addition to Kepler’s direct work as a university program, they promote the secondary aim of creating a “university in a box.” All of their data is being provided as open source content in order to encourage other institutions to adopt aspects of Kepler’s model in order to reduce the cost and increase the quality of current higher education options.

He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2014. In 2017, he proposed the \\"MacArthur Amendment\\" to the Republican Party's Affordable Care Act legislation, which would have allowed states to waive out of the ban on pre- existing conditions and helped revive Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The repeal effort was ultimately unsuccessful. Early life, education, and career MacArthur grew up in Hebron, Connecticut. He received his bachelor's degree from Hofstra University. After graduating from Hofstra, MacArthur became an insurance adjuster. He served as the chairman and CEO of York Risk Services Group, a multi-national organization that provides insurance services. He was chairman and chief executive officer of York Risk Services Group for 11 years. He served on the Randolph, New Jersey, Township Council from 2011 through 2013, including a tenure as mayor in 2013.

MacArthur resigned from the Randolph council to move into the congressional district, where he had owned a home.Knapp, Claire. \\"Former fire chief is new Randolph Councilman; Forstenhausler will fill MacArthur's term\\", Randolph Reporter, February 10, 2014; accessed July 6, 2014; \\"Mark Forstenhausler, 54, was sworn in as a member of the Township Council on Thursday, Feb. 6, to complete the term vacated by Tom MacArthur.\\" He ran against Steve Lonegan in the Republican Party's primary election, and defeated him. MacArthur faced Democratic nominee Aimee Belgard, a Burlington County freeholder, in the general election. MacArthur's campaign expenditures totaled $5.6 million, with MacArthur personally contributing over $5 million to his campaign from his personal fortune. MacArthur outspent Belgard by about three to one (with both campaign's spending equaling a combined total of $7.4 million), making the race the most expensive open-seat contest in the country in 2014. MacArthur defeated Belgard by nearly a 10-point margin, decisively winning the popular vote in Ocean County, and losing the Burlington County part of the district by only 352 votes. He was sworn in on January 6, 2015, along with 58 other new members of the House of Representatives. He was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and two of its subcommittees, the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces and Subcommittee on Military Personnel. MacArthur was elected Vice Chairman of the latter subcommittee. He was also assigned to the Natural Resources Committee as well as two of its subcommittees, the Subcommittee on Federal Lands and the Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Oceans. On February 2, 2015, MacArthur introduced the \\"Disaster Assistance Fairness and Accountability Act of 2015\\" that will prevent the Federal Emergency Management Agency from taking back disaster relief funds from individuals who applied for them in good faith. On March 25, 2015, MacArthur introduced the \\"Veterans' Mental Health Care Access Act\\" to allow veterans with a Choice Card to access mental health care at any facility eligible for reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Both bills were considered \\"dead,\\" by virtue of a failure to garner approval from Republican-led subcommittees, before the final sine die Adjournment of the 114th Congress. MacArthur's legislation to reform FEMA was re-introduced in the 115th Congress and became law. =2016 election= MacArthur ran for re-election in 2016. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary. In the general election, he faced Democrat Frederick John Lavergne. MacArthur won the election with 60% of the vote. At his second term MacArthur was appointed to the Committee on Financial Services and stepped down from the Armed Services Committee and the Natural Resources Committee. He was also a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and the Climate Solutions Caucus. =2018 election= MacArthur was defeated by Democrat Andy Kim, a former national security aide to President Obama, in the midterm election on November 6. The race was not officially called for eight days, after which Kim was declared the winner. With a margin of victory of fewer than 4,000 votes, or slightly over one percent of votes cast, this congressional race was the closest in New Jersey. During the campaign, MacArthur emphasized his bipartisan record, willingness to oppose his own party, and his record of constituent service, while seeking to highlight Kim's apparent exaggeration of his resume and portray him as a \\"radical resistance\\" figure. Kim highlighted MacArthur's prominent role in the Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, while emphasizing his own experience in national security and his refusal to accept corporate PAC donations. During the campaign, MacArthur sought to portray Kim as a D.C. elitist and outsider. In an ad run by the New Jersey Republican Party, Kim was described as \\"Real Fishy\\" in Wonton font, a font that has been associated with expressing \\"Asianness,\\" on a picture of dead fish.

MacArthur also was a member of the Board of Directors of the National Republican Campaign Committee, and Trustee of the Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts. Political positions MacArthur was ranked as the 15th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 115th Congress and the 44th most bipartisan in the 114th United States Congress in the Lugar Center - Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy Bipartisan Index.The Bipartisan Index ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party). As of October 2018, MacArthur had voted with his party in 89.3% of votes in the 115th United States Congress. As of October 2018, FiveThirtyEight found that MacArthur had voted in line with President Trump's position 94.6% of the time.Tracking Congress in the Age of Trump, accessed September 27, 2018 As of September 2018, he had voted in line with President Trump's position more than any other member of Congress from the state of New Jersey.You'll never believe who the Tea Party just endorsed in N.J., accessed September 27, 2018 = Economic issues= MacArthur was the only member of Congress from the New Jersey congressional delegation to vote yes for the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; other lawmakers harshly criticized the adverse impact of the bill on New Jersey taxpayers. The tax plan would lead to an aggregate tax cut in most states, but has stirred controversy in New Jersey due to the decrease in the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction to $10,000, which means that the bill raises taxes on many New Jersey citizens. MacArthur explained his vote by asserting that \\"nearly all taxpayers\\" in his district do not need SALT deductions above $10,000, and citing his efforts to restore the deduction to $10,000 after prior versions of the bill eliminated it entirely. When asked to elaborate by the Washington Post fact-checker, MacArthur said that 93% of his constituents did not pay SALT higher than $10,000 and shared his team's calculations with the Washington Post. The Washington Post fact-checker gave MacArthur \\"Two Pinocchios\\", writing that \\"even that accounting ignores the interaction of the property tax provision with other parts of the tax bill, so even people who would benefit from the cap still might find themselves with an increase in taxes. MacArthur appears to have worked diligently to tilt the bill so that it would benefit his constituents, but he oversells his achievement.\\" MacArthur was the only member of the New Jersey congressional delegation to vote in favor of a bill that funded farm subsidies for five additional years while imposing work requirements and new restrictions on food stamp usage. According to NJ.com, the bill, which did not pass, would have cost 35,000 New Jersey residents their access to food stamps. According to Vote Smart's 2016 analysis, MacArthur generally opposes allowing individuals to divert a portion of their Social Security taxes into personal retirement accounts. = Environment = MacArthur introduced legislation to combat pollution in Barnegat Bay and cosponsored legislation to reauthorize the National Estuaries Program. The League of Conservation Voters has given him a lifetime score of 10%. MacArthur opposes the Trump administration's proposal to open New Jersey's waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. According to Vote Smart's 2016 analysis, MacArthur generally supports the building of the Keystone Pipeline, supports government funding for the development of renewable energy, and opposes the federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. = Gun policy = MacArthur had described himself as a supporter of the Second Amendment and has a 93% rating from the National Rifle Association. =Healthcare= MacArthur became a key player in efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, citing the loss of his first child and his own background in insurance as motivating factors. Then-candidate Andy Kim cited MacArthur involvement as a motivating factor for his own run against MacArthur, and healthcare became a dominant theme in the campaign. MacArthur has repeatedly called for repealing the Affordable Care Act and helped craft legislation for its repeal. However, in January 2017, he was one of nine Republicans who voted no on its repeal. On March 20, 2017, MacArthur announced his support for the American Health Care Act of 2017. On April 25, 2017, MacArthur introduced an amendment to the Act which became known as the MacArthur Amendment. It permits states to waive out of Obamacare's ban on pre- existing conditions, allowing insurers to charge sick people higher premiums than healthy people. It also dictates that health insurance offered to members of Congress and their staffs not be included in the exemption from covering pre-existing conditions.Kliff, Sarah. \\"Republicans exempt their own insurance from their latest health care proposal\\", \\"Vox\\", April 25, 2017, Retrieved April 26, 2017 A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in April 2017, found that 70 per cent of Americans favored protections for pre-existing conditions.Kliff, Sarah. \\"Republicans’ new health amendment lets insurers charge sick people more, cover less\\", \\"Vox\\", April 25, 2017. Retrieved April 26, 2017 In response to MacArthur's vote to pass the AHCA, which would partially repeal and replace Obamacare, there were protests in his district, and MacArthur held town halls where some constituents questioned MacArthur about his vote. MacArthur resigned as chair of the Tuesday Group in May 2017 due to disagreements among its members over the AHCA. The repeal effort was defeated in the Senate in a narrow vote where Republican senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and John McCain joined with all Senate Democrats in voting against it. = LGBT rights= MacArthur's 2014 campaign website stated that he believes marriage is \\"between one man and one woman,\\" and that questions of marriage should be resolved at the state level. It would appear later versions of MacArthur's campaign website did not contain this language. MacArthur led a bipartisan effort to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the 2020 Census, and opposed the Trump Administration's efforts to ban transgender persons from military service. Garden State Equality, a New Jersey LGBT advocacy organization, endorsed MacArthur for re-election in 2016. In 2018 Garden State Equality stated that MacArthur was \\"one of the most pro- LGBTQ Republicans in the nation and has proven a steadfast ally to the LGBTQ community,\\" though the organization withheld an endorsement in the race due to differences with MacArthur over healthcare policy. Personal life MacArthur lives in Toms River, New Jersey, and also owns homes in Randolph and Barnegat Light, New Jersey. He is married to his wife Debbie and has two children, a son and daughter, both adopted. Their first child, Gracie, was born with special needs and died in 1996 at the age of 11. In Gracie's memory, the MacArthurs founded In God's Hands Charitable Foundation, which funds programs that help wounded veterans and children affected by AIDS in Africa. During his time in office, MacArthur was the wealthiest member of New Jersey's congressional delegation, with minimum reported assets worth about $31.8 million as of July 2017.

He was a controversial figure in the Presbyterian Church in the United States in the 1880s.  Early life  James Woodrow was born in Carlisle, England on May 30, 1828, the son of a minister, Thomas Woodrow.\\"Dr. James Woodrow as Seen by His Friends: Character Sketches by His Former Pupils, Colleagues and Associates\\", pg. 8 At the age of eight, the young James Woodrow moved with his family to Canada, but after finding the climate of Canada disagreeable, the family relocated to Chillicothe, Ohio.Woodrow pg. 10  Education and early career  Woodrow attended, and graduated from Jefferson College in 1849.Woodrow, pg. 9 After some time in Alabama, as a teacher, Woodrow entered the Lawrence School of Science at Harvard University in 1853 to study under Louis Agassiz. In 1855 and 1856, he studied at Heidelberg University, from where he graduated with an A.M. and Ph.D. summa cum laude. Along with studying science, Woodrow studied religion and in 1859 was ordained by the Hopewell Presbytery, then part of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.Woodrow, pg. 13 He was also appointed as Professor of Chemistry, Geology, and Natural Philosophy at the University of Georgia, but never took the position.\\"James Woodrow, the University of Georgia Professor of Geology who never was\\" Instead, Woodrow took a position at Columbia Theological Seminary in 1861, becoming the first Perkins Professor of Natural Science. In 1866, with financial aid from his brother, Woodrow also opened a printing business. He restarted the Southern Presbyterian Review, which had been begun in 1846, but had its final publication in 1864, until the circumstances brought about by the Civil War put an end the magazine.\\"The New Southern Presbyterian Review: a Revival\\". Counsel of Chalcedon , Mark D. Anthony, Sr. pg. 17 Woodrow served as its owner, publisher and chief editor, and, among other things, engaged in a literary debate about geology with fellow PCUS churchman R.L. Dabney, a professor of theology at Union Theological Seminary.  Controversy  In 1859, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published, causing theological controversy in religious circles. Woodrow had initially been opposed to evolution, yet eventually became convinced that evolution was true, although, he also believed that there was no contradiction between evolution and the Bible. His silence on the issue throughout the late 1860s and into the 1870s served to provoke rumors that Woodrow had indeed embraced evolution. In 1879, a Columbia Seminary board member named J.B. Mack urged Woodrow to publish his views to quell the rumors, but he replied that his only peculiar teaching on the matter was his rejection that the world was created in 6 literal days.Smith, pg. 3 An 1883 statement from the board of Columbia and from Woodrow to the PCUS General Assembly stated that, as the Bible didn't specify God’s method of creation, it wasn't contradictory to Scripture to embrace evolution. The statement prompted Mack, who served as the board’s financial agent, to have a request approved by the board asking Woodrow to divulge his views as soon as possible. Woodrow, in no position to refuse, revealed his views at a meeting of Columbia Seminary’s Alumni Association in the spring in 1884.Smith, pg. 4 Woodrow stated that it was possible that Adam’s body could have organic continuity with preceding creation, although his soul was uniquely created, as was Eve’s body and soul. He also stated that, while he believed the Bible to be true, he had no duty to try and harmonize the probable truths of evolution with Scripture. The revelation of Woodrow’s views created a major firestorm. Within the PCUS, a push to remove him from the Perkins Professorship had begun. Most of the synods and presbyteries in the denomination also had overtures coming in regarding the issue. In September 1884, the Seminary published a statement saying that while they disagreed with Woodrow’s theory as to how Adam was created, they found none of his views to be incompatible with Christianity.Smith, pg. Nevertheless, owing to the controversy, and a change in leadership in the Seminary, in December 1884, Woodrow’s resignation was requested. However, Woodrow refused to resign or appear before the Board to explain why he refused to decline.Smith, pg. 12 In the years to come, there would be internal conflict at the seminary over Woodrow’s position, and the conflict even forced Columbia to close their doors for the academic year of 1887-1888. Moreover, in 1886, Woodrow was tried for heresy by the Augusta Presbytery, a trial in which he was exonerated, although the presbytery’s ruling was overturned by the Synod of Georgia the following year. Woodrow, after years of controversy, was eventually removed from his office at Columbia Theological Seminary. The controversy also prompted the PCUS to take a staunch stance against evolution, a stance which wasn’t changed until 1969.  After the controversy  In 1891, Woodrow was elected the president of South Carolina College, a post which he occupied until 1897.Miller, James \\"Beyond Non-Contradiction: Lessons from the case of James Woodrow\\", The Presbyterian Outlook Despite the controversy, Woodrow remained a minister in good standing in the PCUS, and after serving as moderator of the Augusta Presbytery in 1888, went on to serve as moderator of the Synod of Georgia in 1901.Woodrow was also named as president of a local bank between 1888 and 1891. Woodrow died in Columbia, South Carolina, on January 17, 1907, aged 78.  Personal life  In 1857, Woodrow married Felie S Baker, the daughter of the Rev. J.W. Baker, a fellow Presbyterian minister. The couple had four children: a son named James, who died in 1892, who left a widow and three children; and three daughters: Jeanie, Marion and Charlotte.

The production of filled shells began in April 1916 and ended when the factory closed in 1924 Background At the outbreak of World War I, the production of explosives and the associated filling facilities for high explosives were limited to the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, and the facilities of the Elswick Ordnance Company at Derwenthaugh and Lemington Point, both close to Newcastle Upon Tyne. The British Army found itself on the Western Front short of explosive shells and bullets. The Ministry of Munitions (MoM) under new minister David Lloyd George, were tasked to construct a suitable infrastructure of National Filling Factories (NFFs) to supply the Army. Principles of layout and operation The MoM were looking to create a number of munitions production facilities quickly and cheaply. It acquired a series of large sites in semi-rural locations, ideally quite level, which were close to nearby railway lines for both transportation of product and workers. Although there was no standard design, the principles of layout (for safety and efficient, logical production), plus the dimensions and layout of associated buildings were laid down by the MoM, based on lessons from the Royal Arsenal. Plan form of the final layout was greatly influenced by topography, and the locally contracted architect's ideas. Four explosives filling factories, including that at Banbury, were designed, built and managed by their Managing Directors. Construction of NFFs at Banbury and Perivale were undertaken by the Ministry of Works. In operation the principles of scientific management were applied to the NFF workforce, particularly \\"dilution\\" where by complex skilled work was broken down into individual repetitive tasks, which could hence be performed by unskilled or semi-skilled labour. The result was that in many NFF's, the work force consisted of up to 90% women, who also as bonus had small hands to allow for easier filling of the shells. The workforces also often included children for the same reason, to allow for small and medium shell production. Construction A site of was acquired by MoM in Summer 1915, located east of Banbury beyond the Bowling Green Inn on Grimsbury’s Overthorpe Road. It had good connections with the former-London and North Western Railway Buckinghamshire Railway, which went eastward out of Banbury Merton Street railway station. NFF No.9. was commissioned in November 1915, under the construction management of Mr Herbert Bing of the MoW. The initial sub- contract was let in January 1916 to Messrs Willet of Sloane Square. Laid out to a standard design, the site encompassed: * standard gauge railway. This extended both sites of the site, allowing for separate transport of both bare shells, raw explosives and completed ammunitions * of roads * of guard fence * of footpaths and sentry paths *370 buildings varying in floor area. Like a typical munitions facility, the buildings were widely spaced on safety reasons, to avoid complete destruction of the facility in case of an explosion *The 11 central melting rooms where filling took place, the Picric acid stores, and the two storage magazines were surrounded by earthworks and blast walls. Most buildings were timber-framed, set on brick foundations or latterly concrete slabs, and then weather-boarded or covered in uralite (brown asbestos sheeting). The larger storage buildings with roofs greater than were brick- built, spanned by Belfast trusses. Operations All components were produced elsewhere, mostly shipped in and out by rail, with the facility responsible for final production: inserting explosive into shells, and fitting detonators. Shell filling began on 25 April 1916, with the site exclusively focused on using Lyddite explosive in production. As constructed, the factory comprised only the northerly located No.1 unit, designed to fill of product per week, using just over 1,400 workers. Internal copper tramways, and wooden trucks with copper wheels (so that they did not create sparks), were used to move components and finished shells between buildings and the stores. Empty shells were first inspected, then cleaned and if required, painted. They were then moved to one side of one of 22 melt houses, with the explosive powder held on the opposite side of the building, which was surrounded by a blast-wall. Completed shells were then moved to the two purposefully small filled-shell magazines to the east, and hence quickly moved off-site to an Army Ordnance Department store. No.2 unit to the south was completed less than a year later, with layout modifications incorporated to improve safety and efficiency. This brought the total occupied production area up to . On 30 May 1917, a notice was issued by the British Army on the Italian Front, that from now on Quarter Masters were \\"to only to order and accept the excellent quality shells from NFF No.9,\\" in an effort to invigorate the factory workers. As the Army switched to TNT explosive in its shells, by September 1917 sections of the factory began switching to the production of filling naval mines and shrapnel shells. From June 1918, alongside the supporting plants at Chittenden and ROF Rotherwas, all three were supplied with dichloroethyl sulphide by the National Smelting Company at Avonmouth Docks, to produce mustard gas shells. Under the management of Captain H.W. Snowball, at the height of the war the average output of shells from the facility was 70,000 per week, giving employment to 933 men and 548 women. Due to manual handling of cordite and sulphur, the workers gained hives and risked yellow skin discolouration, hence the locals called the female workers \\"canaries\\". Post war After the cessation of activities, the site was mothballed from December 1918. Leased from mid-1919 to Cohen's of London, they used it in reverse to break-down surplus war ammunition, remaining in operation with a vastly reduced workforce until 1924. 100 men and 72 women wrrked there in 1919. Its final closure was declared in 1927. A then confidential memorandum was sent to Horace Lester on 18 May 1917 by Captain Snowball with idea that the factory could be used for another manufacturing purpose after the war, like the motor depot at Slough Trading Estate had been listed for.p 109, The History of Slough, Maxwell Fraser, Slough Corporation, 1973 There was a smaller satellite depot on the Middleton Road, Grimsbury, in Banbury during 1919 and it was reactivated in World War II. 20 World War II anti-tank phosphorus grenades and a small number of World War I phosphorus grenades were dug up by developers and defused by the army in 2012. After that time, the Ministry of Defence stripped the plant of its machinery, used mainly to keep the similar facility at ROF Rotherwas operational. By the early 1930s, little was left except the buildings and the connecting ends of the railway sidings, and the site began use as an early urban-scale military training facility. Training activity increased greatly in the run-up to World War II, particularly for the Home Guard, so much so that the Nazi Luftwaffe dropped bombs beyond the site at Bowling Green in 1940, in the belief that the site again was operating a filling factory. Present Today, the site is a protected site of archaeological significance, although none of the buildings remain. Their layout can be seen within the residual site - now returned to use as rough pasture - as can the eastern earthworks of No.2 and much of the earthworks of No.1 site, that was not consumed by construction of the M40 motorway. An English Heritage monument commemorates the operations of the facility. During the extension south of the M40 motorway, excavations at Junction 11 for Banbury revealed a number of former facility structures and buildings, which took a considerable amount of effort and decontamination to remove. Half of No.2 site and the western section of No.1 site now west of the M40 has been consumed by the expansion of Banbury.

Of the 64 passengers and crew on board, 32 were killed in the accident, and many of the survivors sustained injuries.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-124 registered as CCCP-45086 to Aeroflot. The aircraft was rather new as it had rolled off the assembly line in August 1965. At the time of the accident the aircraft had sustained 357 flight hours and 300 pressurization cycles. (one cycle equals one takeoff and landing)  Crew  Nine crew members were aboard the flight. The cockpit crew consisted of the following: * Captain Donat Samuilovich Nekludov (Донат Самуилович Неклюдов) * Co-pilot D. A. Kuneshov (Д.А. Кунешов) * Navigator Y. M. Vishnev (Ю.М. Вишнев) * Flight engineer V. I. Romanov (В.И. Романов) * Radio operator F. I. Petrov (Ф.И. Петров) The dispatcher along with the stewardess A.E. Artsibasheva (А.Е. Арцыбашева) worked in the cabin. Accident Aeroflot Flight SU99 took off from Leningrad-Pulkovo Airport at 14:21. The flight went smoothly during takeoff and cruise. However, during the descent towards Murmansk, weather had deteriorated with cumulonimbus clouds at 260 meters, snow and visibility of 1.5 km. At 15:50, 7 minutes before the estimated time of arrival, the air traffic controller informed the flight of the deteriorating weather conditions at the airport and instructed the flight to fly at an altitude of 2400 meters; shortly thereafter he ordered the aircraft to reduce altitude again to reach 700 meters. The bearing for the landing was 215°. When the flight was at an altitude of 800 meters the captain began a turn, losing altitude quicker than anticipated. During the approach, 7100 meters from the runway, the Tupolev was flying 400 m to the left of the extended centerline. When the flight was at an altitude of 180 meters and trying to pass the non-directional beacon that was about 2400 meters from the runway, the aircraft entered the snowstorm. Shortly thereafter the pilot-in-command increased the rate of descent, and at 15:57 the Tu-124 crashed into the frozen Lake Kilpyavr while 273 meters short of the beacon and 2127 meters short of the runway. After hitting the ice the aircraft lost the left wing, and the fuselage broke in two, separating from the cockpit. The right wing then separated. The fuselage stopped on the ice 1562 m from the beginning of the runway, and quickly sank. Soldiers managed to save several passengers from the sunken fuselage. The cockpit stopped on the ice 166 meters to the left of the fuselage then fell through the ice into shallow waters near a small island in the middle of the lake; It sank partially. All crew members except the navigator and dispatcher managed to escape. Soldiers stationed at a building near the beacon rushed to rescue the passengers and crew from the crash, but 32 of the 64 people aboard perished in the crash.  Cause  The pilots descended below the glidepath but did not notice their mistake immediately. What the pilots thought were runway lights were actually lights from a neighborhood near the airport, causing the pilots to think they had not descended enough; hence they increased the rate of descent even more. When the pilots noticed the mistake, it was too late and the aircraft crashed onto the frozen lake. Secondary reasons for the crash included that the airport was not equipped with glidepath approach lights, and the air traffic controller had failed to warn the crew that their altitude was too low relative to their proximity to the runway.

History  Statue of John Wesley in Savannah, Georgia, where he served as a missionary. The movement which would become Bible Methodist Connection of Churches began in the mid-18th century within the Church of England. A small group of students, including John Wesley, Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, met on the Oxford University campus. They focused on Bible study, methodical study of scripture and living a holy life. Other students mocked them, saying they were the \\"Holy Club\\" and \\"the Methodists\\", being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle. Eventually, the so-called Methodists started individual societies or classes for members of the Church of England who wanted to live a more religious life. In 1735, John and Charles Wesley went to America, hoping to teach the gospel to the American Indians in the colony of Georgia. Instead, John became vicar of the church in Savannah. His preaching was very legalistic and full of harsh rules, and the congregation rejected him. After two years in America, he returned to England dejected and confused. On his journey to America, he had been very impressed with the faith of the German Moravians on board, and when he returned to England he spent time with a German Moravian who was passing through England, Peter Böhler. Peter believed a person is saved solely through the grace of God and not by works, and John had many conversations with Peter about this topic. On May 25, 1738, after listening to a reading of Martin Luther's preface to Romans, John came to the understanding that his good works could not save him and he could rest in God's grace for salvation. For the first time in his life, he felt complete peace and the assurance of salvation. In less than two years, the \\"Holy Club\\" disbanded. John Wesley met with a group of clergy. He said \\"they appeared to be of one heart, as well as of one judgment, resolved to be Bible-Christians at all events; and, wherever they were, to preach with all their might plain, old, Bible Christianity\\". The ministers retained their membership in the Church of England. Though not always emphasized or appreciated in the Anglican churches of their day, their teaching emphasized salvation by God's grace, acquired through faith in Christ. Three teachings they saw as the foundation of Christian faith were: # People are all by nature dead in sin. # They are justified by faith alone. # Faith produces inward and outward holiness. Very quickly these Methodist clergymen became popular, attracting large congregations.Wesley, John. A Short History of Methodism. Online: . Accessed May 1, 2009. The first official organization in the United States occurred in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1784, with the formation of the Methodist Episcopal Church at the Christmas Conference with Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke as the leaders. The ordination of Bishop Francis Asbury by Bishop Thomas Coke at the Christmas Conference establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church, 1784. Though John Wesley originally wanted the Methodists to stay within the Church of England, the American Revolution decisively separated the Methodists in the American colonies from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church. In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new Church in the colonies, Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society. Together with Coke, Wesley sent The Sunday Service of the Methodists, the first Methodist liturgical text, as well as the Articles of Religion which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference was held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, considered the Mother Church of American Methodism. The new Church grew rapidly in the young country as it employed circuit riders, many of whom were laymen, to travel the mostly rural nation by horseback to preach the Gospel and to establish churches until there was scarcely any village in the United States without a Methodist presence. With 4,000 circuit riders by 1844, the Methodist Episcopal Church rapidly became the largest Protestant denomination in the country. In 1843, Methodists who favoured abolitionism initiated a schism with the Methodist Episcopal Church, leading to the formation of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. In this new denomination, the \\"Episcopal form of government inherited from Wesley and Anglicanism, was replaced with a loose connection of societies or churches which characterized the Methodist movement in its earliest days\\". In 1943, the General Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church recommended the strengthening of the “central supervisory authority to oversee the work of our Church.” The Wesleyan Methodist Church adopted a proposal in 1966 to merge with the Pilgrim Holiness Church, thus forming the Wesleyan Church; those who strongly disagreed with the merger, as well as the trend of greater centralization, formed the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches. In 1994, the United Holiness Church, which broke from the Free Methodist Church in 1955, joined the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches. In 2019, the Pilgrim Nazarene Church merged into the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches.  Educational institutions and camps  The Bible Methodist Connection of Churches operate one Christian school, three family camps, and three youth camps.Because no values have been specified for the \\"prop\\" parameter, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Part of the Tennessee Association of Rescue Squads, the Blount County Rescue Squad is staffed by trained volunteers and responds to medical emergencies, provides aid and support services to other departments serving Blount County, participates in search and rescue operations and assists with other needs when called upon.  Services  The Blount County Rescue Squad responds simultaneously with American Medical Response to medical emergencies, such as injuries and sudden illnesses, and provides emergency care until more advanced personnel arrive. Most squad personnel are trained and certified as Emergency Medical Responders, however some are licensed as Emergency Medical Technicians, Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics. In the event of a large incident, including but not limited to apartment fires, natural disasters, and multiple casualty incidents, the Blount County Rescue Squad provides support services to its citizens and other surrounding agencies. The support trailer is equipped with medical supplies, food, water, shelter, and other necessities. BCRS also works closely with BSORT (Blount Special Operations Team) to utilize dive search and recovery assets in maritime emergencies. With a team of NASAR-certified search and rescue personnel, the Blount County Rescue Squad responds to incidents requiring search and rescue operations.  Stations and Apparatus  The organization currently operates out of one station, its headquarters, located in Alcoa. This station is conveniently centered close to all locations within the county. While the rescue squad is primarily responsible for locations outside the corporate city limits of Alcoa and Maryville, they will respond within city limits when requested. thumb = Apparatus = The headquarters houses two squad trucks, two SUVs, two boats, and one support trailer.  Rescue 1 (R01)  Rescue 1 was previously the designation of a multi- compartment, general purpose squad truck equipped with vehicle extrication tools, EMS equipment, generators, and other life-saving tools. However, as of January, 2016, the vehicle that previously held the designation Rescue 1 was sold, and a new vehicle was purchased as a replacement. The new Rescue 1 is a small rapid response vehicle based on the 2015 Ford Explorer SUV with the police interceptor package, and is equipped for rapid response to medical emergencies. It contains an EMS jump bag, oxygen, spinal immobilization equipment, a suction unit, and Automated External Defibrillator (AED). thumb  Rescue 2 (R02)  Rescue 2 is multi-compartment truck used for support and auxiliary purposes. This truck is one of the oldest, yet largest, trucks in the fleet.  Rescue 6 (R06)  Rescue 6 is a quick response SUV, used mostly for emergency medical response. Like all other vehicles, this SUV is packed with essential EMS equipment, such as a basic life support (\\"jump\\") bag, oxygen equipment, spinal immobilization equipment, a suction unit, and an AED. thumb  Rescue 7 (R07)  Rescue 7 is another quick response SUV. Unlike Rescue 6, Rescue 7 is more equipped and capable for wilderness search and rescue. This vehicle contains a built-in platform with a stokes basket, pre-rigged rope rescue system and manual extrication tools, providing rescuers with tools and equipment that assist students in accessing and extracting patients. thumb Additional Equipment In addition to standard emergency response vehicles, BCRS also utilizes several other types of rescue apparatus such as ATV’s and marine assets used in support of BSORT operations. thumb thumb  The Dragon  In a collaborative effort and agreement with American Medical Response, the Blount County Rescue Squad staffs U.S Route 129 infamously known as the Tail of the Dragon by motorcycle enthusiasts, during the Spring, Summer, and Fall seasons. This curvy, two-lane stretch of highway encompasses the Tennessee-North Carolina border alongside the Appalachian Mountains through Deal's Gap. Due to the hazardous conditions this highway presents to motorists, accidents frequently occur. To reduce response times and increase survival rates, Blount County Rescue Squad personnel dedicate their time to establish their presence on the Dragon. thumb  References  *Blount County Rescue Squad Category:Non-profit organizations based in Tennessee ","title":"Blount County Rescue Squad"},{"id":"42757308","text":"Aneflus obscurus is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Life Walker was born on 5 February 1822 in Marefair, Northampton, and his parents sent him to an academy in the Horse Market at the age of six, where he remained till 10: the headmaster was James Harris. His father died when he was young, and his mother accepted the offer of relatives at Oxford to take charge of him. He was taught carpentering there in the workshop of a Mr. Smith. At the close of his apprenticeship he began business with a Mr. Lee; but he had decided to become a journalist. Having learned shorthand, in September 1846 Walker advertised in The Times for a job. T. P. Healey, proprietor of the Medical Times, took Walker on as reporter; he wrote also for Eliza Cook's Journal. Having met Frederick Knight Hunt, assistant- editor of the Daily News, he wrote for the News, and then obtained a junior post on the editorial staff, working under Joseph Archer Crowe. In 1851 he became foreign and general sub-editor. On the death of William Weir in 1858 he was appointed to the editorship, becoming known as a supported of Italian nationalism, and by his confidence in the ultimate victory of the Union in the American Civil War; under the influence of Harriet Martineau he became a staunch advocate of the cause of the North. Walker resigned the editorship in 1869 to accept the charge of the London Gazette; and retired on 31 July 1889, when the office of editor was suppressed there. He died on 16 February 1898 at his residence in Addison Road, Kensington, and was buried on 20 February in Brompton cemetery. Frederick Greenwood wrote in the Pall Mall Gazette of his \\"great political candour\\". He was a close student of the philosophy of Thomas Brown, and active as a congregationalist. Family Walker was twice married, and a daughter survived him.

Overview The Pio XI multi-sport complex is located on an 18-acre piece of land in Rome only a few hundred yards from Vatican City as Vatican City is not large enough to house sports fields of its own. It has a capacity of 500 spectators and is equipped with artificial turf and floodlights. The field is known for having a clear view of Saint Peter's Basilica. History The Campo Pio XI stadium is part of one of several sports complexes built, funded, and maintained by the Italian Knights of Columbus. The fraternal organization began building free recreational facilities for Roman Catholic youth in 1920 after Pope Benedict XV asked the Order to do so. The field was consecrated and blessed by His Eminence Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, Vatican Secretary of State, in May 1926. Recently, Serie A club AS Roma has begun hosting youth tournaments at the stadium.

Although other two-player Monopoly computer programs already existed, the developer advertised that their Automonopoli was the first with an artificial intelligence strong enough to compete against and defeat human players. Initially released under the name Automonopoli, Waddingtons threatened legal action against Automata, and within weeks of its release the game was rebranded as Go to Jail. Waddingtons, concerned about the potential impact on a forthcoming official Monopoly video game, began formal court proceedings against Automata in late 1983, and the game was withdrawn from sale in early 1984.  Initial release  Automonopoli was released by Automata UK in June 1983, written primarily in BASIC, and modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay. Although other versions of Monopoly for home computers were already in circulation for play between human players, at the time of its release Automonopoli was marketed as the first version of the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough for the computer to play against human players. Rather than display the entire board, only two full spaces (and a section of a third) are displayed at one time during gameplay. The board scrolls from right to left as the player advances following each dice roll, while pressing the \\"X\\" key takes the player to a separate screen showing a full list of sites and their current ownership, allowing players to buy and sell properties between themselves, to build houses and hotels, and to mortgage and unmortgage properties. On landing on a property the player is offered the chance to buy it; if the player declines, or they have insufficient funds, the property is put up for auction. The game copies the UK version of the Monopoly board game in every significant detail, including the exact wording of the property names and \\"chance\\" cards. Sold almost exclusively by mail order, the game received limited but positive reviews on its release from the few magazines which then covered ZX Spectrum gaming. A short review in ZX Computing at the time of its initial release, praised the \\"excellent\\" graphics and the strength of the computer's gameplay, a theme repeated in a brief review in Crash. The only full-length review, in ZX Computing nine months after the game's original release, also praised the AI's gameplay and said that \\"the only major complaint I can make against the program is its limited use of sound\\".  Legal action and change of name  Shortly after its release, Waddingtons, UK publishers of the Monopoly boardgame, raised objections to the Automonopoli title, saying that there was a risk purchasers would confuse the two products. Automata changed the name of the product to Go to Jail in their packaging and advertising, claiming in their advertising that despite being identical in every way, Go to Jail was unrelated to Automonopoli. Waddingtons was in talks with Parker Brothers (the US publisher of Monopoly) over jointly developing an official Monopoly computer game, and continued to object to perceived infringement by Automata; Waddingtons spokesman Neville Fishwick said \\"They are riding on the back of a game we have had for 50 years. They know damn well it's not their game, it's ours\\". In December 1983 Waddingtons began court proceedings against Automata; Automata in turn launched a fundraising campaign with the support of the Computer Trade Association, whose secretary Nigel Blackhurst said \\"The Waddingtons action represents a major threat to the whole computing industry. If they win about 80 percent of the games software in the market would become challengable\\". In January 1984, the courts ordered Automata to withdraw the program from sale. In May 1984 Waddingtons announced that the official ZX Spectrum version of Monopoly would be released shortly by Leisure Genius, although Waddingtons would retain the responsibility for taking legal action against the publishers of other computer games based on the board game. The official Monopoly video game was eventually released in July 1985, and was described by Home Computing Weekly as \\"vastly superior to the other non- authorised versions\\".

After winning once as a two-year-old in 1986 he won the Predominate Stakes in 1987 before recording his first Group One success in the Gran Premio d'Italia. He continued to improve with age and developed into a formidable international campaigner over long distances winning the Grand Prix de Deauville, Prix Maurice de Nieuil, Geoffrey Freer Stakes, Preis von Europa, Grosser Preis von Berlin and Irish St. Leger. On his penultimate start he produced arguably his best performance when finishing second in the Breeders' Cup Classic. He was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Japan where he had limited impact as a sire of winners. He died in Japan in December 2012. Background Ibn Bey was a big, powerful chestnut horse with a white star and white socks on his hind legs bred by Lord Porchester. He was sired by Mill Reef the 1971 Epsom Derby winner who went on to be Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1978 and 1987. Ibn Bey's dam, Rosia Bay, was a daughter of the broodmare Ouija, who was also the dam of Teleprompter, the grandam of Ouija Board and the great-grandam of Australia. Rosia Bay herself went on to produce the Yorkshire Oaks winner Roseate Tern. As a yearling, Ibn Bey was sold for 210,000 guineas to the Saudi Fahd Salman. The colt was sent into training with Paul Cole at his stable at Whatcombe in Oxfordshire. Racing career =1986: two-year-old season= Ibn Bey made his racecourse debut in the Danepak Bacon Stakes over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse in August. He stayed on well in the closing stages to finish fourth of the six runners behind Lack A Style. In October he recorded his first success by beating thirteen opponents in a maiden race at Haydock Park Racecourse. =1987: three-year-old season= After finishing fifth behind Legal Bid in the Lingfield Derby Trial on his three-year-old debut, Ibn Bey contested the Predominate Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, a trial race for The Derby and won by two lengths from Alwasmi and Classic Tale. In the Derby he started at odds of 40/1 and finished thirteenth of the nineteen runners behind Reference Point. He finished fourth at Goodwood in July and then ran third behind Moon Madness and Legal Bid in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. In September, Ibn Bey was sent to Italy for the Group One Gran Premio d'Italia over 2400 metres at Milan and won the race by ten lengths form Jung. On his final appearance of the season, the colt ran poorly in the Irish St. Leger at the Curragh, finishing sixth of the eight runners behind Eurobird. =1988: four-year-old season= Ibn Bey was beaten in his first four races of 1988. He finished third under top weight of 128 pounds in the Aston Park Stakes at Newbury, fourth behind Almaarad in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot, fourth, beaten 26 lengths, by Unfuwain in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket, and fourth again in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes in August. On his final appearance of the season, he was sent to France to contest the Grand Prix de Deauville over 2700 metres on 28 August. Ridden by Michael Roberts, he took the lead 400 metres from the finish and won by two lengths from the Barry Hills-trained Sudden Victory. =1989: five-year-old season= As a five-year-old, Ibn Bey again began his season in the Aston Park Stakes and finished second to Albadr, to whom he was conceding six pounds. He was then moved up in distance for the Henry II Stakes over two miles at Sandown Park Racecourse and finished fifth, more than thirteen lengths behind the winner Sadeem. In July he was dropped in class and distance for a Listed race over fourteen furlongs at Lingfield Park Racecourse and defeated the odds-on favourite Mountain Kingdom (winner of the Ormonde Stakes and Yorkshire Cup) by two lengths. In this race he was ridden for the first time by Richard Quinn, who became his regular jockey. Later that month Ibn Bey was sent to France again and won the Group Two Prix Maurice de Nieuil and won by a short neck from the André Fabre-trained three-year-old Mardonius. Two weeks later, Ibn Bey made his third attempt to win the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. Starting at odds of 9/2, he raced in second before overhauling the favourite Apache in the final strides to win by a head. In September, Ibn Bey was sent to Germany for the Group One Preis von Europa over 2400 metres at Cologne in which his opponents included Sheriff's Star (Coronation Cup, Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud) and Mondrian (German Derby, Grosser Preis von Berlin, Aral-Pokal, Grosser Preis von Baden). Ibn Bey took the lead soon after the start and drew away from his opponents in the straight to record his fourth consecutive victory, winning by six lengths from Mondrian. On his appearance of the season, Ibn Bey was sent to contest the Japan Cup at Tokyo Racecourse on 26 November. He led the field for most of the way, but was overtaken in the straight and finished sixth behind the New Zealand mare Horlicks who won in a world record time of 2:22.2. =1990: six-year-old season= In 1990 Ibn Bey began by finishing third to Creator and In The Wings in the Prix Ganay and then ran third to In The Wings in the Coronation Cup. In June he was ridden by Mick Kinane in the Gran Premio di Milano, but finished fourth, more than twelve lengths behind the winner Tisserand. In July Ibn Bey was reunited with Quin and returned to Germany for the Grosser Preis von Berlin in which he faced a field which included Mondrian as well as the German Derby winner Karloff. He recorded his fourth Group One victory, beating Mondrian by four lengths. Ibn Bey and Mondrian met for the third time in the Grosser Preis von Baden in September and on this occasion the German horse won. Ibn Bey led for most of the race but was caught inside the final furlong and beaten by a length. Three weeks after his defeat in Germany, Ibn Bey contested the Irish St. Leger over fourteen furlongs at the Curragh and started the 5/1 second favourite behind the 1989 St Leger Stakes winner Michelozzo. He raced in second place behind the three-year-old Thetford Forest (later to win the Sun Alliance Novices' Hurdle) before taking the lead two furlong from the finish. He was headed by the outsider Mr Pintips but rallied to regain the advantage 100 yards from the finish and won by a length. After this race he entered the ownership of Yustane Sohma. Ibn Bey was sent to the United States to contest the seventh running of the Breeders' Cup Classic at Belmont Park on 27 October when he raced on dirt for the first time, and ran over a distance shorter than one and a half miles for the first time since 1986. His opponents included Unbridled, Go and Go, Izvestia, Opening Verse and Rhythm. Ibn Bey was positioned just behind the leaders before turning into the straight in second place. He caught the leader Thirty Six Red inside the final furlong but was immediately overtaken on the inside by Unbridled and finished second, beaten a length by the winner. On his final appearance, on 25 November, Ibn Bey made a second attempt to win the Japan Cup. Ridden by a local jockey, he was held up in the early stages and despite making some progress in the straight he never reached the leaders and finished eighth behind the Australian gelding Better Loosen Up. Assessment In 1986, the independent Timeform organisation gave Ibn Bey a rating of 88p, the \\"p\\" indicating that the colt was likely to make more than normal improvement. In the following year he was given a rating if 117 by Timeform, whilst the official International Classifiaction rated him on 118, seventeen pounds behind the top-rated Reference Point. Ibn Bey was later rated the best three-year-old colt to race in Italy in 1988. Stud record Ibn Bey was retired to Japan where he stood as a breeding stallion at the Big Red Farm. He sired 79 winners, including the Group I Derby Grand Prix winner Taiki Herakles. He was pensioned from stud duty in 2007 and died on 10 December 2012 at the age of 28.

The album was released on December 6, 2013, and is her eleventh non-compilation release. Creation and promotion The mini album was part of a series of albums Younha released following a self-imposed hiatus due to panic disorder. It was also the third release following the annulment of Younha's contract with Lion Media after well-documented litigation. The tracks were all recorded and released during Younha's stint as host for MBC radio program Starry Night. It has been stated by the artist as a departure from her early career as a mainstream radio mainstay, and thematically reflects a relief from the pressure of maintaining popularity while also pursuing other genres. The album's title and subsequent songs make references to subsonic phenomena, thematically alluding to concepts of speed, movement, and time, especially in contrast to Younha's previous album Supersonic, which generally contains more guitar-driven, faster tempo music than Subsonic. Three tracks were previewed ahead of the album's release, including a down-tempo version of Run from the Supersonic album and It's Okay. A music video was then released for Home. A clip featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the filming of the music videos were also released as a preview. Following the release of the digital album, a music video debuted for the third track, Not There. Physical copies were made available on December 12, 2014 Performances Younha later held a piano- focused concerts, titled \\"26 and\\", at Olympic Hall on December 27–28, 2014.

Early life Mentana is the eldest son of Franco Mentana, a Calabrian sportswriter, and Lella Mentana, a Jewish woman from Macerata. Raised in the Giambellino district of Milan, he attended liceo classico \\"Alessandro Manzoni\\" before joining the Italian Socialist Party. He became an editor of Young Left, the official organ of the Federation of Young Socialists, of which he was vice president from 1977 to 1979. He then enrolled at the University of Milan to study political science, but never graduated. Career = RAI = On 27 February 1980, Mentana was hired by RAI, Italy's public radio and television broadcaster. His first interview was with the mother of Mehmet Ali Ağca after Ağca's assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II. Within RAI, Mentana was put in charge of TG1, the newscast hosted on the main channel RAI 1 and then became deputy director of TG2. In 1987, he refused a request from Bettino Craxi, the leader of the Italian Socialist Party, to be the main spokesperson for a political commercial. This led to tension between Mentana and the RAI management. Starting in 1988, Mentana was restricted to minor roles. In 1991, he was fired from RAI. = TG5 = In autumn 1991, Mentana began working for Fininvest, and on 13 January 1992, he started the newscast hosted on the newborn Channel 5: TG5, with Lamberto Sposini, Clemente J. Mimum, Emilio Carelli, Cesara Buonamici, and Cristina Parodi. Mentana served as director of the newly created newscast, whose audience often exceeded seven million listeners. TG5 beat TG1 in viewership several times (the first time was with its extra edition announcing the murder of Judge Giovanni Falcone), making Mentana one of the best-known TV hosts in Italy. = TG LA7 = After his experience at TG5, he moved to TG La7, the newscast hosted on the privately owned channel La7. He became its director in 2010.  Awards and honors  * In 1995, he received the Ischia International Journalism Award. * Asteroid 48720 Enricomentana was named in his honor.

It has been reported as having been founded with a membership of some 2,000 former officers; later obtaining a total strength of up to 40,000 members. The organisation was active in the US occupation zone in southern Germany, and aimed to field up to four armoured divisions in case of war. It was to become active in case of an attack by East Germany in a domestic German conflict similar to the Korean War, but without outside interference. History The organisation was formed in secret in 1949 by Albert Schnez, who had risen to the rank of colonel in the Wehrmacht during World War II. The aim of the secret army formed by Schnez was to liberate Germany if an invasion by the Soviet Union should occur. Initially, it would retreat to a foreign country, possibly Switzerland or Spain, the latter ruled by Francisco Franco's government. Schnez's secret army was to have weapons supplied by the West German police, with the help of Anton Grasser, inspector general of the police and a former Wehrmacht general, who had been privately employed by Schnez after the war before joining the police. Schnez also organised road transport for his forces through logistics companies. The organisation engaged in surveillance of left-leaning politicians, like the outspoken member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany faction in the German parliament, Fritz Erler. In case of war, the secret army was planned to be used against communists in West Germany. Schnez was in contact with other right-wing organisations and individuals in Germany, such as Otto Skorzeny, in relation to resistance to a Soviet invasion. In 1951 Schnez offered the service of his organisation to the German intelligence service, the Gehlen Organization, predecessor of the Bundesnachrichtendienst, providing black lists of potentially left leaning individuals as well as, in one case, profiling a member of the police as Halbjude (half-Jew). German chancellor Konrad Adenauer became aware of the secret army around 1951 and informed leading opposition politicians of its activities, but did not order any decisive action against Schnez, shying away from conflict with World War II veterans. Instead, he ordered the domestic intelligence services to monitor the organisation and provide small-scale financial support. Within the Gehlen Organization the Schnez-Truppe received the code name Unternehmen Versicherungen (Operation Insurance). The fate of the secret army is unknown, but leading figures of the Schnez-Truppe joined the then newly formed West German armed forces, the Bundeswehr, in 1955; among them was Adolf Heusinger, first Inspector General of the Bundeswehr and Chairman of the NATO Military Committee from 1961 to 1964, and Hans Speidel, Supreme Commander of NATO ground forces in Central Europe from 1957 to 1963. Albert Schnez also rose to the rank of Inspector General of the Bundeswehr and finally retired in 1971, having become an obstacle to the reforms of the armed forces by then-defence minister Helmut Schmidt. The general public in Germany was unaware of the Schnez-Truppe until 2014, when files relating to it were declassified by the Bundesnachrichtendienst after having been re-discovered in 2011. The declassified files were reviewed by German historian , grandson of Albert Kesselring, who was part of an independent commission to study the early history of the German intelligence service. The file on the Schnez-Truppe in the archive of the Bundesnachrichtendienst in Pullach, Bavaria, was over 300 pages long. The Schnez-Truppe was part of a larger movement in West Germany at the time, codenamed the Windhund-Bewegung (Greyhound movement), based on the insignia of the 116th Panzer Division. Gerhard von Schwerin, former commander of the division, served as a consultant in military and security matters for the West German government under Adenauer. West Germany, not armed at the time, was concerned with its own inability to defend itself following the outbreak of the Korean War. The main aim was to have a counter-force to the Kasernierte Volkspolizei of East Germany in case of a Korea-like scenario should the East attack. According to intelligence reports at the time, the Kasernierte Volkspolizei possessed almost 1,300 tanks, of which 47 were heavy and 480 medium battle tanks. The Schnez-Truppe was to field four armoured divisions, to be deployed in case of a German-only war between East and West, with no outside interference. The tanks for these armoured divisions, however, would have had to been provided by the US Army as West Germany possessed none at the time and Schnez was most active in southern Germany, particularly Württemberg and Bavaria, in the former US occupation zone. Historian Agilolf Keßelring concluded that Schnez's activities were almost certainly known to US intelligence agencies. The Schnez-Truppe was organised down to company level and consisted predominantly of members of former German elite tank divisions. Attempts by Otto Skorzeny to establish a similar organisation to the Schnez- Truppe were seen more critically by the Gehlen Organization, as Skorzeny was considered too unpredictable. Assessment The Schnez-Truppe never came close to a similar status and structure to the post-First World War Freikorps. German historian Sven Felix Kellerhoff concluded that the organisation was part of the pre-history of the Bundeswehr. In Kellerhoff's conclusion, the organisation was known to the German government, the German political opposition as well as German intelligence agencies and the US authorities in Germany. The Schnez-Truppe was a political risk, but given the lack of any native defensive capability in West Germany, a necessary measure to counter the perceived threat from communist East Germany.

He was born in Baltimore County, Maryland on March 2, 1751, the son of a German father and a Burgundian mother. Brought up in a strict Anglican home, Gatch was taught to read at an early age and in his early teenage years refused to attend church. However, after the death of his sister and uncle, he fell into a depression in which he was \\"alarmed by dreams, by sickness, and by various other means, which were sent by God, in his mercy, for my good.\\" Upon attending a revival meeting held by a Methodist minister named Nathan Perigau in January 1772, Gatch grew increasingly attracted to the small group of local Methodists, despite his father's displeasure. He was eventually converted under the preaching of Robert Strawbridge and began his own preaching career at the age of twenty-two in 1773. Gatch played an important role in the transitional years of American Methodism as it broke away from its British connection during the late eighteenth century. He attended the Annual Conference of 1777 when increased responsibility was given to American-born preachers over the Methodist work in the States, a significant transition away from British oversight. Two years later he played a pivotal leadership role in the decision of the Methodists in the south to set up a presbytery of four ministers who would ordain one another so that they could then, in turn, ordain others to administer the sacraments. During the Revolutionary War, Methodist ministers were subject to hostility, since their leaders were English. Gatch escaped imprisonment, but \\"he was, perhaps, the subject of as much, or more, persecution for his Master's sake than any of his contemporaries.\\" During his years of ministry, Gatch travelled throughout New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland before he stopped itinerating in 1778 due to poor health. He married Elizabeth Smith in 1778, and settled down in Powhatan County, Virginia, and later moved to Ohio, where he was sold land near the town of Milford. While in Ohio, Gatch helped to establish the Methodist Episcopal Church's presence there, but also became a surveyor, land agent, justice of the peace, associate judge in Clermont County, Ohio, and a member of the convention that drafted the Constitution of Ohio. At the convention he was a strong advocate for the rights of Black people. He voted to allow non-white men to vote, and to allow them to hold office and testify in court against a white man. Thomas Scott, secretary of the convention, wrote in 1853 of Rev. Gatch: \\"He was constantly treated with deference and respect, and regarded by the members and officers of the convention, and others, as an honest, pious, plain, sensible, useful member of the convention. His general deportment was grave, yet courteous, affable, and friendly. ... He occupied an elevated standing in my own estimation, and I take great pleasure in bearing this testimony of his intrinsic worth.\\" Motivated by his religious convictions, Gatch was an outspoken critic of slavery. After marrying, he chose to manumit the slaves he had inherited by marriage. His deed of emancipation read \\"Know all men by these presents, that I, Philip Gatch, of Powhatan County, Va., do believe that all men are by nature equally free; and from a clear conviction of the injustice of depriving my fellow-creatures of their natural rights, do hereby emancipate and set free all the following persons.\\" He also joined the Humane Society of Richmond for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. His distaste for slavery likely explains his choice to move north in his latter years in life. For he recorded that he was reluctant \\"to die [in Virginia] and leave my offspring in a land of Slavery,\\" and so he moved from Virginia to Ohio with his extended family in 1798, happy to cross the Ohio River, \\"which separates between slavery and freedom.\\" Gatch died from influenza on December 28, 1834 in his home.

Featuring a brash, aggressive sound, the album drew admiration from critics and proved highly influential for the Christian hip hop movement.  Style and lyrics  Tunnel Vision features an aggressive, underground sound. Jason Young of RapReviews.com noted that the collective consists of blacks, whites, and Latinos, men and women, thus offering a diverse sound. Young said that on the album's title track, rapper Macho channels an \\"early-1990s LL Cool J\\" sound, and considered the decision to change tempo for the track's bridge was \\"pure genius.\\" Of rapper Raphi, Young mentioned that he \\"does his best Slim Shady impersonation on his solo joint, 'Motivate', albeit with some decidedly un- Eminem lyrics.\\" Exclaim!'s Thomas Quinlan's called \\"Motivate\\" \\"Timbaland- influenced\\", \\"Human Race\\" as mariachi sounding of \\"Human Race\\" and considered \\"Remember\\" a \\"testimonial track\\". Anthony DeBarros of CCM Magazine described Tunnel Vision as hip hop \\"and occasional R&B;\\", and felt that while Tunnel Rats did not break any new musical ground, the collective had \\"a knack for using studio tools effectively.\\" He explained that \\"Zane’s 'Change' floats over a shimmering electric piano, and 'For the Heads' evokes a jazzy nostalgia with an acoustic piano loop and simulated record-groove clicks and pops.\\" Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today described the Tunnel Rats' style as \\"modern hip-hop that blends melodic hooks and world music sounds to the rap and beats.\\" Breimeier cited \\"Motivate\\" as an example of Tunnel Rats' innovative sound, as the song blends \\"rapid machine-gun rapping with a Latin-sounding melodic hook, smartly programmed drums, and (get this) a harpsichord.\\" Breimeier also referenced \\"Sev Statik\\", which bathes its sound in strings and Middle Eastern instruments, and \\"Ladies\\", which \\"tackles biblical feminism with the same spirit that Salt n' Pepa brought to the topic years ago.\\" In discussing the challenging lyrical content of the album, Breimeier highlighted \\"2 Cents\\", which used \\"jazz-soaked hip hop\\" to tackle the issue of Christians being too quick to judge, the \\"dissonant sounding\\" track \\"Finish Line\\", which Breimeier considered \\"a smart rephrasing of I Corinthians 9:24–27\\", and the catchy \\"Master Plan\\", which he viewed as offering a sobering statement of the world as per the Book of Jeremiah. Cross Rhythms's Sam Gunnell stated that \\"Each track has its own individual sound and content but each possesses the usual hard hitting and challenging lyrics\\" and noted that the final track has an \\"R&B; vibe\\". Reception Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic rated the album three stars out of five, stating that it highlights the Tunnel Rats \\"anti- commercial approach to hip-hop, showcasing intelligent rhymes, creative beats, and original songwriting.\\" CCM Magazine's Anthony DeBarros rated the album three-point-five out of five, concluding that \\"The self-referential braggadocio wears thin after a while, but not enough to dull this otherwise fine piece of art.\\" Sam Gunnell of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares and expressed that the album showcases some of the best female rappers he had ever heard. Gunnell cited \\"Motivate\\" as his favorite song on the album, but also recommended the tracks \\"Ladies\\", \\"2 Cents\\", and the album's final, hidden track. Tony LaFianza of The Phantom Tollbooth rated the album four-point-five out of five, stating that \\"These 22 tracks of seriously inventive music and reality, put Tunnel Rats on the point of hip hop, and make Tunnelvision the best rap record of the year.\\" Thomas Quinlan from Exclaim! while the album is not always successful, \\"there are some songs that prove that rap and Christianity are no longer mutually exclusive\\". Quinlan listed \\"T.R.'z\\", \\"Sev Statik\\", and \\"Pray for Morning\\" as the best songs on the album. RapReviews.com's Jayson Young rated the album eight-point-five out of ten, stating that \\"I can't say enough good things about 'Tunnel Vision'.\\" Young highlighted the tracks \\"T.R.z\\", \\"For the Heads\\", \\"Bow Down\\", and \\"Chainge\\" as examples of Dert's excellent production, and stated that LPG, a duo consisting of Jurny and Dax, provide the backbone for the group. Young also noted Sev Statik, whom he considered \\"much improved\\" compared to his appearances with \\"Uprok's equally-impressive\\" Deepspace 5 collective. Young lavished praise on female rappers Zane and Elsie, stating that they \\"are two of the most talented women I have ever heard bless the mic, and they make me realize what a shame it is that Lil' Kim and Trina's ilk are so much more famous.\\" In particular, he considered Elsie's performance untouchable, proclaiming that he was \\"happy to say that in a group of MCs as talented as the Tunnel Rats, the BEST MC in the crew is a woman.\\" Russ Breimeier in a review for Christianity Today called the album \\"a Christian hip-hop album intent on leading the genre to a new artistic standard\\". Breimeier also appreciated how the album challenged the artistry and originality of Christian artists, while simultaneously criticizing the lack of integrity and ethics in mainstream music. Despite these praises, Breimeier cautioned that the Tunnel Rats are not for all tastes, and said that some songs do not work as well as others. For instance, Breimeier found \\"For the Heads\\" as having \\"too much ego in it, as well as some questionable words.\\" Nevertheless, Breimeier concluded that \\"We could use more Christian artists as bold and creative as Tunnel Rats.\\" Dispute with Cross Movement In an article on the Tunnel Rats, Imade Nibokun of LA Weekly considered Tunnel Vision a response to criticisms the group received from East Coast hip hop group The Cross Movement. In 2001, The Tonic, a member of The Cross Movement, in an interview accused the Tunnel Rats of placing more importance on musical credibility than sharing the Gospel. Fans of The Cross Movement also criticized The Tunnel Rats, claiming that they did not distinguish themselves enough from aggressive, secular West Coast rappers. Nibokun wrote that the turbulent sound on Tunnel Vision \\"embraced everything that the conservatives hated\\" and \\"was a musical middle finger to anyone who found their battle-rap bravado sinful.\\" In particular, she noted the opening line by Dax on the song \\"T.R.'z\\", which criticizes Christian rappers with sub- par musical ability: \\"I pull a pistol out my pocket and I cock it.\\" Influence Imade Nibokun noted in LA Weekly that \\"T.R.'z\\" \\"abrasive sound effects and full drums\\" succeeded \\"as something of a wake-up call to a still relatively staid genre.\\" Imade explains of Tunnel Vision that \\"Yes, there were spiritual references... ...but the work felt raw. Critics were impressed, and a whole generation of Christian emcees took note.\\"  Music video  A music video for the song \\"T.R.'z\\" was released. According to member Raphi (a.k.a. Shames Worthy), the video was shot on 35 mm film in an old railroad tunnel in Los Angeles, with a budget of $10,000 USD. It included features of b-boy Ivan the Urban Action Figure and graffiti artists Frustr8, Pryer (UTI) and Skill 1. Track listing All production by Dert, except \\"Motivate\\" by Raphi.

The personal cloud is not a tangible entity. It is a place which gives users the ability to store, synchronize, stream and share content on a relative core, moving from one platform, screen and location to another. Created on connected services and applications, it reflects and sets consumers’ expectations for how next-generation computing services will work. The four primary types of personal cloud in use today are: Online cloud, NAS device cloud, server device cloud, and home-made clouds. Online cloud The online cloud is also sometimes referred to as public cloud. Online cloud is the cloud computing model where online resources like software and data storage are made available over the Internet by a service provider. In an online cloud model, cloud services are provided in a virtualized system, are constructed using pooled, shared physical resources and are accessed by the Internet. Typically, an individual or organization has little control over the ecosystem in which the online cloud is hosted, and the core infrastructure is shared between many individuals and organizations. The data and applications provided by the service provider are logically segregated so that only those authorized are allowed access. NAS device cloud A network-attached storage (NAS) device is a computer connected to a network that provides only file- based data storage services to other devices on the network. Although it may technically be possible to run other software on a NAS device, it is not designed to be a general purpose server. Cloud NAS is remote storage that is accessed over the Internet as if it were local. A cloud NAS is often used for backups and archiving. One of the benefits of NAS Cloud is that data in the cloud can be accessed at any time from anywhere. The main drawback, however, is that the speed of the transfer rate is only as fast as the network connection the data is accessed over and can therefore be fairly slow. Server device cloud In many ways cloud servers work in the same way as physical servers but the functions they perform can be very different. Typically, the cloud server is an on-premises device that is connected to the Internet and gives users the functions available on the online cloud but with the added benefit and security of the files being in their control on their premises. The server cloud has been historically enterprise-based deployed by businesses needing an in-house cloud. However, there are also in-house options available for individual users. Home-made clouds For the more technologically proficient user a common solution for using a personal cloud is to create a home-made cloud system by connecting an external USB hard drive to a Wi-Fi router. This enables both wired and wireless computers to access the USB hard drive and use it for storage or for retrieving files a user needs to share on the network thereby acting like a cloud. The challenge for the home-made cloud is that in order to set it up a user has to have a certain degree of skills in technology and network setup. This solution is not for novices and average consumers. If this setup is not done by a tech expert the biggest issue will be security and leaving the files accessible to anyone with technical knowledge. Not every router supports this type of access and modification.

History From the 15th century, a manor house belonging to the Loménie family occupied the site until about 1690, when it passed to a relative Pierre de Loménie, who left it to Pierre de Villoutreys, his godson. The Villoutreys family lasted until Louis-Henri Gratz, who committed suicide in the house in 1811. The property was sold in May 1812 and after two auctions, 112,100 gold francs to M. Léonard de Loménie, a member of the Loménie family who had previously owned the château. In the 1950s, it was sold to the CGT union of Seine-Maritime and in the 1990s it was bought by its current owners who are undertaking external and internal restorations. It has been listed since 2005 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. Architecture The current château was built from 1782 to 1786 to a design by the architect Joseph Brousseau, as the old manor dating from the 15th-17th centuries was destroyed. The new château, which was perhaps not fully completed at the time of the French Revolution, especially in its interiors, presents itself as a framed main building with two low wings. Its interior decorations (raised floor), in the Classical style, are quite beautiful and well-preserved. The interior with its wood panelling and sculptures in gilded wood is a registered historical monument. A garden à la française, supplemented by a garden, accompanied the monument. The garden has two levels of rectangular terraces, a vegetable garden and an orchard are also registered historical monument. The garden to the east was transformed in the 19th century into a park.

He also runs many other firms in Argentina, the U.S., and elsewhere, and resides in Buenos Aires and Miami. Molinari described himself in 2011 during a brief foray into electoral politics as “a businessman who believes in social justice,”. He is a longtime associate of the Kirchner family and a key figure in the so-called K money trail, the 2013 political scandal centering on acts of embezzlement and money laundering by persons connected to the presidential administrations of Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Career Molinari has been described as the “son of a trade unionist” and as being “of humble origins.” He is president of Real Estate Investments (REI) Sociedad Fiduciaria, which manages real estate in Argentina, including the 68-hectare Hudson Park in Berazategui. Hudson Park, “an exclusive gated community,” has been described as Molinari’s “beloved child.” It includes houses, a condo-hotel, and shops, all built at an investment of around $30 million.” In the U.S., Molinari is the President of Global Development Consultant Inc., based in Miami, Florida, and registered in 2009. He is also a Managing Member of Adg Group Holdings, LLC; The New Langford, LLC.; and La Bahia, LLC. In addition, he has served as an officer of several now-inactive U.S. entities, such as the Americas Real Estate Investments Inc., American Condo Hotel Group, Miami Wolf Soccer Team Inc., MDJ Housing Industries Corp., Argentinian Construction Group LLC, and National Argentine American Foundation, Inc.https://opencorporates.com/officers/8100171http://www.bizapedia.com/people/CARLOS- MOLINARI.html In addition to Hudson Park, Molinari has constructed a hotel- condominium development, La Aldea de Pilar, and a project called “La Mansión,” a complex of “VIP towers” in the historical district of Quilmes. Noting that all three of these projects are located in areas governed by Kirchernist politicians, a journalist for Perfil observed that “politics often helps one find more and better opportunities.” In March 2013 Molinari was described as being currently engaged in “developing a condo-hotel in a historic downtown building” in “most Latin American cities.” At the time, he was planning to initiate such projects shortly in Punta del Este, Pilar, Bernal, Mar del Plata, and Rosario. Molinari has built low-cost housing in Haiti out of containers. Molinari explained that this was an ecologically positive activity, given that there are “a lot of unused containers” in ports and that their rusting “causes severe environmental pollution problems.... By using this material, we are recovering a toxic waste.” Molinari was described in 2013 as a gifted analyst of the real-estate market, who in a 2004 conversation with Tomás Regalado, later elected mayor of Miami, predicted the mortgage crisis “when nobody was talking about anything but the euphoria of large investments.” It was reported in March 2013 that Molinari had “recently” started work on a 40-hectare Public Industrial Park in Canelones, Uruguay, an investment of $120 million. Molinari is a director or shareholder of such Argentinian firms as Land Developer SA, and Sharks Sports SA, ADG Argentinian Developer Group SA, among others. In October 2012, it was reported that Molinari wanted “to create a new airline in forty-five days.” He was in negotiations to buy seven aircraft from the defunct Uruguayan airline Pluna, which was in bankruptcy proceedings, and re-employ most of its 700 former employees. He presented Homero Guerrero, secretary to the Uruguayan president, with a plan to purchase the aircraft for close to $130 million and form a Uruguayan-based airline called Alas Sudamericanas, at an initial total investment of $190 million, that would be in the air within 45 days. He even met with President Mujica of Uruguay. But the plan did not work out. Molinari complained that the issue had been “politicized.” He said, however, that he was carrying out feasibility studies aimed at the creation of his own Uruguayan airline, explaining that Uruguay ”is a strategic point in Latin America.” Molinari is a founding member of the regional business platform Developers & Builders Alliance (DBA), which has offices in the U.S. and throughout Latin America. Political activities In 2011, Molinari ran as deputy when his friend Mario Ishii challenged the candidacy of Daniel Scioli for re-election as governor of the Buenos Aires province. \\"We are a possible alternative to the management of the current provincial leader,” Molinari told an interviewer. “We are able to see an alternative for the people of Buenos Aires with my practicality and with the ideological capacity of Mario Ishii.” Ishii and Molinari failed to win, despite a reported expenditure by Molinari of 6 million pesos.http://www.latecla.info/3/nota_1.php?noticia_id=46948 =Obama connection= Molinari is friendly with Miami businessman Freddy Balsera, who led the Barack Obama campaign’s outreach effort to Latinos and is head of the Hispanic Council of the Democratic Party in the U.S. Together, Molinari and Balsera have been involved together in a business venture involving “social housing.” Molinari visited the White House in 2010 and contributed financially to the reelection campaign of President Obama in 2010. He also attended a 2010 dinner in Miami in support of Obama at the mansion of Gloria and Emilio Estefan, where he spoke to President Obama. He has also donated to the Democratic Party PAC ActBlue.http://www.city- data.com/elec2/10/elec-MIAMI-FL-10-part3.html =K money trail scandal= The scandal erupted as a result of the April 14, 2013, episode of the investigative journalism program Periodismo para todos (Journalism for All), hosted by Jorge Lanata. The episode, entitled “The K money trail,” included hidden-camera footage on which Leonardo Fariña, the husband of famous model Karina Jelinek, described in detail the financial maneuvers whereby Lázaro Báez, a businessman close to the Kirchners, managed to transfer about 55 million euros from Argentina to Switzerland. Fariña had aided in this money- laundering operation, and it was established that the link between Báez and Fariña was Molinari, who was described as the “protector” of Fariña, a childhood friend of his son Martin. Appearing on the Jorge Rial radio program later in April, Molinari maintained that he had no involvement in money- laundering; that he had never met Báez; that he had met Fariña in late 2010, when Fariña had approached him with the idea of starting a luxury-car rental agency; and that he had known Federico Elaskar since the latter was 15 years old and a friend of his son, living in the same apartment building as the Molinaris, but that he had never done business with him.http://www.clarin.com/politica/Molinari-Elaskar-conozco-amigo- hijo_0_906509541.htmlhttp://www.perfil.com/politica/Hablo-Carlos-Molinari-el- multimillonario-jefe-de-Leo- Faria-20130423-0031.htmlhttp://www.clarin.com/politica/Empresario-blanquear- contactos-Elaskar-Farina_0_907109322.html “I'm a businessman,” Molinari said. “I do business.”http://www.elliberal.com.ar/ampliada.php?ID=87665http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/68847/ In late April 2013, Molinari was violently assaulted by five men in the Palermo section of Buenos Aires who took several items from him, including his Audi A7 truck, which was found abandoned shortly thereafter.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1576136-asaltan-y-golpean-al-empresario- carlos-molinari It was suggested that the beating and robbery of Molinari were the work of “mobsters” sending a “message.” Elisa Carrió, a member of the Argentinian parliament, described Fariña in April 2013 as being “protected” by Molinari.http://tn.com.ar/politica/carrio-%E2%80%9Ctodo-lo-que-dice-farina- tiene-respaldo-documental%E2%80%9D_383507 Fariña testified in June 2013 that he was an auditor for Austral Construcciones, a firm owned by Báez, and that he worked for Molinari, who paid him a monthly salary of 70,000 pesos.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1590774-leonardo-farina-declaro-ante-la- justicia-y-admitio-que-conoce-a-lazaro-baez Also in June 2013, Maximiliano Acosta told a court that Molinari and his son Mathias had presented themselves to him as project developers and as representatives of Báez and his son.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1589050-el-testigo-de-boda-de-farina-complico- a-perez-gadin It was reported in July 2013 that Molinari was “in trouble” in the U.S. courts. He was sought in connection with a Miami trial, Carlos Germán Díaz vs Global Development Consultant Inc, in which he was named as a defendant, and with a New York case, brought by Kenneth Welt against Diego Molinari, Deborah Batista, and Amadeo Molinari of Moll Systems Corporation, that involved a payment to a Panamanian firm, Tensho Media.http://dockets.justia.com/docket/florida/flsdce/1:2013cv20729/416235 In September 2013, federal judge Sebastián Casanello ordered a raid on Molinari’s firm Rei Fiduciaria, in order to determine the legitimacy of Fariña’s claim that his lavish lifestyle could be accounted for by his income from Rei Fudiciaria.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1616457-caso-baez-allanan-una-firma-y- carrio-pide-interpelar-a-timerman =Relations with Fariña= Molinari has been described as the man who “invented” the husband of Karina Jelinek, “since it was he who gave her the famous Ferrari” and paid for the couple’s wedding. Molinari said that Fariña had been recommended to him by a lawyer in La Plata. “He proposed to me the business of high-end car rental, and bought five cars, some on behalf of the company and others in my name,” said Molinari. “The idea was good, because they were cars that were not in Argentina.” At that time Fariña had not yet become involved with Jelinek, and “seemed to be a person with an ordinary life.” Molinari said he paid Fariña “a per diem of six thousand dollars and also had a stake in the [car-rental] company.” After Fariña and Jelinek became a couple, Molinari disliked the negative press that the couple generated and encouraged Fariña to lower his profile and to clarify that his car was company-owned and that he was not a millionaire. Molinari said he had paid for Fariña’s and Jelinek’s wedding, a total outlay of 480,000 pesos, in order to promote the car-rental firm, some of whose wares were on display at the wedding.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1591140-farina-dejo-muchas- dudas-ante-el- juezhttp://lasombradelespectaculo.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/escandalo-farina- rossi-carlos-molinari-el-hombre-que-invento-al-empresario/ Elaskar testified that he knew Fariña through Molinari’s son Matías.

She was an American rhythm and blues and jazz singer and songwriter. In her stage show from the 1940s and early 1950s she portrayed herself as a simple farm girl. Her vocal style inspired later R&B; and soul singers, among them LaVern Baker, Ruth Brown, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Wynona Carr and Billy Wright.Rich Kienzle, \\"Little Miss Cornshucks 1947-1951 (Classics)\\" , review from Not Fade Away, Issue #47 September–October 2003.

Her own career never achieved full recognition in her lifetime. Life Cummings was born in Dayton, Ohio.Dave Penny, \\"Little Miss Cornshucks\\", This is My Story. BlackCat Rockabilly. She was the youngest child of a large musical family of African-American origin. Mildred began to sing with her sisters, as the Cummings Sisters, performing spirituals in the Dayton area. By the time she was seven, she was making solo appearances in young people's amateur talent shows. She developed a stage wardrobe that appealed to black southern agricultural workers who at that time were migrating from the south to the US northern industrial cities. Her stage show was performed barefoot, with a straw hat, braids, backwoods clothes and a basket to evoke memories of the rural south. She would appear uncouth by staring blankly and picking her nose. When her act started she would move into the latest dances and songs sung with a deep feeling coming from bitter experience. This appeal to rural migrants was used by other artists of that era such as LaVern Baker who sang as Little Miss Sharecropper.Deffaa, Chip, Blue Rhythms: Six lives in rhythm and blues, University of Illinois Press, 1996 , . In US and Canadian English a cornshuck is the husk of an ear of maize. In 1940, Cummings married Cornelius Jorman, with whom she had three children. Her husband worked as her manager and accompanied her at her performances. By 1942 she was a star in the Chicago area, performing at the Rhumboogie Club.\\"Big Road Blues Show 4/11/10: I Got What My Daddy Likes – Forgotten Blues Ladies Pt. 2\\", Big Road Blues. The band leader and arranger Marl Young who worked at the club recognised her talent and signed her under contract to the then famous Club DeLisa. A year later, the future owner of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, heard her sing in Washington DC and wrote in his memoirs: > \\"1943, I was about 19 years old; I went to a nightclub in the northeast > black district of Washington DC and heard a singer named Little Miss > Cornshucks and thought: 'Oh God!' She was better than anything I had heard > so far. She came across like a country girl, provided with a headscarf and a > basket in her hand and so on; but she could sing the blues better than > anyone I've heard to date. That night I asked her if I could record a record > with her. We then played Kansas City and a few other blues numbers and the > song So Long.

For health reasons, Miss Cornshucks had to interrupt her career in the mid-1940s. She returned to Ohio and there she finally separated from her husband Cornelius, who was involved in the drug trade. She then returned to her native Indianapolis and became increasingly dependent on alcohol. Her Sunbeam recordings were now republished on the Old Swingmaster label and she enjoyed some success in the Detroit area based at the Frolics Bar. Performances in New York and Washington followed. During one of these tours she met the dancer Henry \\"Henny\\" Ramsey, who became her lover and with whom she spent several years on tour while her children stayed with her family in Dayton. Ramsey and Cornshucks lived together for a while in Los Angeles, where she appeared in the clubs of Central Avenue, such as the Last Word Room and Club Alabam. In 1948 she appeared at the Million Dollar Theater in down- town Los Angeles. This was a converted former cinema. She was billed as \\"the new look in comedy\\" and \\"a rustic comedienne\\". Her comedic talent gave her a small film role in Campus Sleuth, a 1947 B-movie made by Monogram Pictures, and produced by The Bowery Boys and Charlie Chan. In May 1948, she recorded new songs for the small label Miltone in California under the direction of saxophonist and producer Maxwell Davis. In 1948, she performed alongside Dizzy Gillespie at the fourth famed annual Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on September 12. Also on the program that day were Frankie Laine, The Sweethearts of Rhythm, The Honeydrippers, Joe Turner, Jimmy Witherspoon, The Blenders, and The Sensations.“Stars Galore to Swing and Sing At Wrigley Park” Article The California Eagle Sept. 2, 1948 The 1950s saw her return to Chicago and she continued to sing in the clubs there while living in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In late 1960 she came out of semi retirement to record an LP for the Chess label, produced by Sonny Thompson, entitled The Loneliest Gal In Town.\\"Little Miss Cornshucks – The Loneliest Gal In Town\\", Discogs. Success eluded her and went instead to Aretha Franklin who recorded a single of the LP's soul-style version of \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\", and had a hit with it.

Morales' non- objective paintings can be best described as \\"fantastically crafted abstractions that get your imagination going in so many directions that you start to wonder why they are neither maddening nor frustrating but strangely serene in their own offbeat sensitive way.\\"http://assets-p.artcat.com/file_uploads/file_asset/asset/31cebe9b1863f228adf16e3cd2e0b53bc96dc3da/b3ccb9b3631671d9fecd263cf1444e94.pdf References * Carotinuto, Gianna, “Rebecca Morales” in Art Issues, Summer 2001 * Los Angeles Times, Catch the Eye Catch the Brain, February 13, 2009 Footnotes External links *The artist's Website *Bravin Lee Gallery Category:20th-century American painters Category:Modern painters Category:American contemporary artists Category:People from Torrance, California Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Otis College of Art and Design alumni ","title":"Rebecca Jo Morales"},{"id":"42758159","text":"Vasile Drăguț (January 9, 1928--November 1, 1987) was a Romanian art critic and academic.

It is the 35th overall episode of the series. It was written by David Slack and directed by Chris Fisher. It originally aired on CBS on January 10, 2013. The name of the episode is based on game theory concept of the same name. Plot Reese (Jim Caviezel), having been captured by the FBI in \\"Shadow Box\\", is detained in Rikers Island along with three other men suspected of being the mysterious criminal dubbed \\"The Man in the Suit\\". Carter (Taraji P. Henson) attempts to stall the investigation and is initially forced to play along with the idea that Reese is a criminal, under the watchful eye of agent Nicholas Donnelly (Brennan Brown). Reese remains silent during the first interrogation. Finch (Michael Emerson) works to help Carter get Reese out of jail, and in the meantime assigns Fusco (Kevin Chapman) to their latest number, supermodel Karolina Kurkova. The other three suspects being held use cover identities including bank workers. Reese is brought before Carter and goes under the fake name John Warren. Operating from the Library, Finch uses his computer expertise to create IDs and confirmation records for everything Reese says about himself. Reese claims that he doesn't know why he was arrested and simply wants to go home. In Washington D.C., Special Counsel (Jay O. Sanders) receives a report on the Man in the Suit and asks his man Hersh (Boris McGiver) to track down the operative, informing him that he is being held with three other suspects in Rikers. Hersh decides to eliminate them all and gets himself arrested. Carter convinces Donnelly to uncuff the suspects in order for them to gain her trust, and keeps Finch informed of the investigation. Donnelly reviews the evidence he has on the suspects' backgrounds and goes to an address where \\"John Warren\\" works. It is a complete business including \\"Warren\\"'s personal belongings. Finch calls Carter to tell her that John Warren is Reese's most complete cover identity, though work is still to be done and the whole operation could be jeopardized if Donnelly spots even a single flaw. They decide to try pinning one of the other suspects as the Man in the Suit as Finch searches the other suspects' backgrounds for any link to criminal activity. Donnelly later gives Carter an earpiece for his assistance during interrogations. A flashback to 2007 shows Reese and Kara Stanton (Annie Parisse) in a CIA mission, and Reese's discomfort with being an assassin. Kara reassures him that their victims are not innocent, and that loving a job makes you good at it. In the present day, Carter asks Reese if he's killed anyone, but Reese asks her the same question - she agrees to answer if he does so first. Reese talks about how he killed an enemy militant in Bosnia, being forced past his discomfort with the subject. He continues on about his family with all of his information matching records quickly being created by Finch. Donnelly is not satisfied with Carter's soft and friendly approach, but insists they get as much information as possible out of the other men. Hersh, meanwhile, is brought into Rikers as Carter interrogates the other suspects. One man's cover is broken and he is identified as Brian Kelly; Donnelly confirms he has no connection to the Man in the Suit. During food and exercise time, Reese encounters Byron (Terry Serpico), the former owner of his dog Bear. Before he can attack Reese, Byron is stopped by a hulking man who brings Reese to his old foe Carl Elias (Enrico Colantoni), who offers his help to Reese. Though cautious, Reese points out Hersh and requests that Elias send a photo of him to Finch. A flashback to 2009 shows Reese and Kara, posing as a couple, going to a bar and killing a group of terrorists. During another interrogation, Reese tells Carter about his military service. Donnelly interrupts to inform Carter that another prisoner wants to talk; the man reveals his real name as Charles Macavoy and requests immunity in exchange for everything he knows. Donnelly agrees to the deal if Macavoy can identify the Man in the Suit. Suddenly, the fire alarm goes off, and Finch tells Carter he is responsible. He asks her to sneak her phone into Macavoy's pocket, and calls the prisoner, blackmailing him into following his instructions. The fire alarm is confirmed to be false, and Hersh kills Kelly in his cell. Macavoy identifies the other remaining suspect as the Man in the Suit, but Donnelly gets a message and realizes that someone got to Macavoy - he tells Carter that Kelly apparently hung himself and observes how Macavoy appears to be too nervous to tell the truth and figures that if he is pointing to one suspect, the other suspect, Reese, must be the man. Another flashback shows Kara lecturing Reese on being a killer rather than a \\"boy scout\\", and them subsequently kissing. Reese tells Carter in an interrogation of how he was forced to leave his lover for military service. Donnelly later suggests one last test to Carter that will finally reveal Reese - he sends Reese out into the yard and allows the other inmates to beat him in an attempt to see his fighting skills. Reese deliberately allows himself to be beaten until Elias asks the inmates to back off. Carter is furious at how far Donnelly is willing to go and interrogates the other suspect, Packer, and irritates him enough to get him to choke her and pin him as the Man in the Suit instead. Reese is released from prison. Reese thanks Carter for her help, when Donnelly suddenly comes in with a gun, having heard their conversation and realized that Reese is indeed the Man in the Suit. He handcuffs them both, telling Carter she wasted a career helping a criminal. Flashbacks to 2010 show Mark Snow (Michael Kelly) secretly informing Reese to kill Kara and vice versa, and the subsequent mission in Ordos where Kara is presumably killed by a missile (all from \\"Matsya Nyaya\\"). Fusco, meanwhile, saves Kurkova from Armenian mobsters. He calls Finch, who suddenly receives a number from The Machine. Donnelly talks to Carter while driving, confronting her with evidence that she was helping Reese the whole time. Finch, meanwhile, is horrified to realize that the new number is Donnelly's - he calls to warn him when a truck hits the car. Kara Stanton steps out, shoots Donnelly, and sedates Reese. Reception =Ratings= The episode gained 15.67 million views in the US. =Critical reception= The episode received near universal acclaim. Tim Surette of TV.com lauded the episode's writing, saying \\"'Prisoner's Dilemma' was as complete an episode of Person of Interest as there's ever been. When the show is at its best, it's entertaining from several different angles. It's intense, whether the intensity comes from action or interrogations. It's expansive, unraveling the complex story and mysteries behind its central characters. And it's damn funny, surprising its audience with self-aware humor that's disarming. \\"Prisoner's Dilemma\\" hit all these marks without wasting a second, creating an episode with a forward momentum that could not be stopped by anything.\\" Sean McKenna of TVFanatic.com also gave a positive review, saying \\"Really, just when you think you have the show pegged, it throws you for a great turn and coming back for more.\\" References Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Person of Interest (TV series) episodes ","title":"Prisoner's Dilemma (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"42758200","text":"Events from the year 1221 in Ireland.

The name lives on in India, where Ashok Leyland still uses the badge today. First generation The semi-bonneted original Comet was first shown in December 1947. While intended mainly for export, it was also sold in the home market. The wheelbase is and the gross weight . A coach model seating 33, sharing the same front design, appeared in 1948. The cab was built by Briggs Motor Bodies and was shared with the Ford Thames ET6 and Dodge 100. Ford purchased Briggs in 1953, meaning Leyland (and Dodge) were forced to develop new cabs. The original engines were a diesel or a petrol unit; the petrol version was rarely seen in Britain. In 1950 the diesel engine was updated to the new 5.76 litre Leyland O.350 unit, now with . Maximum weight was increased to ; models for tropical zones received a considerably lower rating. In 1955 the maximum power output was increased again, to at 2200 rpm, as the new O.350 Mk. III engine replaced the previous version. Second generation 1956 Leyland Comet 100 In 1952 a cab over version of the Comet became available. This was sold next to the bonneted model until 1955/56, depending on the market. As for the bonneted version, power from the Leyland O.350 engine went from in 1955. This model continued in production until 1958, although Australian models continued to use this cab into the early 1960s. This model also entered production in India after having received government approval in 1951. Ashok Motors, Ashok Leyland after 1954, manufactured it locally. The original front clip design remained in use into the early 1970s. Ashok Leyland proceeded to develop a simplified local cab design and continued to build the Comet into the 1990s. Third generation 1963 Leyland Comet (LAD) In 1958, as part of an effectivization program, the Comet received a new cab - called the \\"Vista Vue\\" cab, it was developed by Albion for a variety of their models. Dodge UK also used it for their 300 model, consequently this cabin shape is often referred to as the \\"LAD\\" design. There was also a heavier duty \\"Super Comet\\" model introduced, which eventually largely supplanted the \\"regular\\" Comet. Also in 1958 the 375 engine, based on the preceding design and rated at 110 hp, became available in the \\"Vista Vue\\" cab. Following this, a redesigned engine with cross-flow cylinder head was released. Initially it was a 370 (6.1 litre) at 110 hp, followed by a 400 (6.6 litre) option at 125 hp. Fourth generation 198x198px Introduced in 1964, the fourth generation Comet used the Ergomatic cab, as also used by a number of other Leyland models and other British truck manufacturers in Leyland Motor Corporation, the Ergomatic was built by GKN- Sankey while the LAD was the work of Motor Panels. Leyland Comet in Jamaica Fifth generation After a decade and a half in retirement, the \\"Comet\\" label was reintroduced in 1986. Again, the model was intended specifically for export markets (primarily in the developing world), with simplified equipment, fewer gears, and a sturdy construction. The design is an all-metal version of the C44 Roadrunner, again simplified in order to make local assembly easier. The design consists of six major pressings, and was designed so as to allow for hand welding on a simple jig. The chassis is made of straight rails. The six-wheeled version is called the \\"Super Comet\\". The Comet was part of a new rationalised range and replaced the Terrier, Boxer, Reiver, Landmaster, and Clydesdale models - although there was some resistance to retiring these classic model names in markets where they had a good reputation. Leyland's previous \\"export special\\", the Landmaster, had been of a bonneted design, but Leyland determined that the bonneted design was becoming less favored across developing markets. Fifth Generation Super-Comet in Jamaica Models ranging from received the 6-98 NV engine. The has the Leyland 402, while the heavier model and the Super Comets have the Leyland 411. With only five speeds, the top speed of a 1986 12-tonne Comet is a mere , but this was more than sufficient for conditions in the markets targeted.Kennett, p. 9 The primary markets intended for the Comet were English-speaking countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and also some Middle Eastern markets. The Caribbean, Latin America, and Singapore also received some Comets.

He was mayor of Lower Hutt from 1950 to 1970. Biography =Early life= He was born in Lancashire and educated at Wigan Technical College. His coal miner father James was killed when he was 8 and his mother with three children got compensation of only £140; Percy thought that \\"things didn’t seem to be quite adding up\\". In West Alton Percy was secretary of the Trades and Labour Council and Organising Secretary of the Independent Labour Party. He became a mines inspector. He married Mary Kirkman in 1922, and the voyage to New Zealand was their honeymoon (they had considered migrating to India instead). They had a son and daughter together. Dowse served in the Royal Air Force during World War II. =Political career= He was president of the Lower Hutt branch of the Labour Party when he stood for the Lower Hutt Borough Council and the Power Board, and his wife Mary stood for the Hospital Board in 1935.Labour Party Candidates (Evening Post, 24 April 1935 p10) He was a councillor from 1935 to 1938, and then a Lower Hutt City Council councillor from 1947 to 1950. He was mayor of Lower Hutt from 1950 to 1970, and on other local bodies e.g. the Wellington Regional Planning Council. During his tenure, the Town Hall and War Memorial Library and several local community centres were built. In 1951 the new Labour council under Dowse faced its first challenge with the proposal to relieve High Street congestion by putting a new road through Riddiford Park, linking Barraud Street (then a cul-de-sac) to Kings Crescent. The alternative was a road alongside the stopbank which the City Engineer said was too expensive and of dubious value. The Barraud Street extension (now Queen's Drive) required moving forty houses from north of Laings Road, and according to the previous mayor William Gregory: \\"Riddiford Park was one of the most beautiful spots in New Zealand, and its whole character would change if a road was put through it\\". Five councillors voted against the road, but it went through after an empowering act was passed by Parliament. :The city now found it had a tenacious mayor, determined to drag it up out of the village mentality of the twenties in order to face up to the needs of the fifties. :During this period of maturation (the mayor was) a man who did not make mere platform pronouncements, and who was astute in political backroom negotiation, Percy Dowse was a ruthlessly practical visionary, a firm man in negotiation, and one who preferred to listen before he spoke. Although his public manner was low-keyed, no-one left his office with any other impression than that he was a quick-witted captain who ran a tight ship. In the 1965 New Year Honours, Dowse was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. =Death= The Dowse Art Museum. He died of cancer in Hutt Hospital in 1970. His wife Mary had died in a car accident in 1964. Dowse Drive in Maungaraki and The Dowse Art Museum in Lower Hutt are named for him and his wife.

Founded in 1962, the brand today specializes in a modern take on the classic styles that Mr. California first created back in the 1960s. Product line Mr. California's current line features long- and short-sleeve woven shirts, knit shirts, jackets, pajamas, hats and T-shirts with illustrations inspired by Mid-Century Modernism. History Mr. California introduced knit and woven shirts in the early sixties, marketing them as \\"leisurewear\\" for men on the go. The shirts had a number of unique features, including the square cut finish, dual front pockets and dual buttons on the sleeves. Each shirt also sported a heraldic crest on the front placket, which became a defining symbol of the brand itself. The crests ranged from a simple fleur-de-lys to decorative crowns to mythical animals all embroidered into each shirt. The line also featured a waist-buttoned \\"Jack Shirt,\\" Cuban- inspired Guayaberas and Polo shirts. In the 70’s, the brand turned its attention to attenuated collars and garish colors in order to service the rapidly evolving disco movement. In the 80’s, the brand turned away from its classic leisurewear roots by creating a new division offering a product called \\"The Bentley.\\" The final Mr. California shirts marketed by the original incarnation of the company were last seen in the late ‘80’s at JC Penny’s in Glendale, California. Then the brand went dormant. Over forty years after Mr. California first appeared on store shelves, a group of classic menswear enthusiasts stepped forward to re-release the brand with the intention of bringing Mr. California back to its 1960's success. Since then, the new Mr. California lines features clothing inspired by the original designs, but updated to suit modern men.

As this dance has many forms and can be found in North Africa and the Middle East, a significant proportion of the terminology is in Arabic. Turkish or Turkish- loan words may also be encountered among belly dance terms. Assuit Assuit, also known as Tulle-bi-telli, is a textile marrying cotton or linen mesh with small strips of metal, with its origins dating to Ancient Egypt. The name translates roughly as \\"net with metal\\". It is frequently worn in Raqs Baladi. Baladi Baladi (Arabic: بلدي / ALA-LC: baladī; nisba-adjective meaning \\"native\\", \\"indigenous\\", \\"of the country\\", \\"rural\\", comparable to English \\"folk\\", with a lower-class connotation. It can be used in the pejorative meaning \\"hick/backwards\\". It can also refer to an Egyptian musical style, the folk style of Egyptian belly dance (Raqs Baladi). It is also sometimes spelled in English as 'beledi'. Chest Camel The chest camel is a movement which is made by isolating the chest, pushing it forward, up, back and down in a rolling undulation. The name of the move is derived from the walk of a camel. Darbuka The darbuka Arabic: دربوكة / ALA-LC: darbūkah) is a single head hourglass shaped drum used mostly in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe to accompany belly dancers. The word tabla is used in Egypt. Some outside the Middle East use the term \\"doumbak\\". Egyptian Figure Eight Egyptian Figure Eight refers to the movement of one hip in opposition to the other on a vertical plane. As one hip moves down, away from the body, up, and then the back to center; the other hip moves up, into the centre, down, and then away from the body. The 'Egyptian Figure Eight' is the exact reverse of 'Maya Hips'. Whereas 'Maya Hips' draws circles from the top, the 'Egyptian Figure Eight' begins at the bottom of the circle. Fellah Fellah (n.) (Arabic: فلاح, fallāḥ) (plural Fellaheen or Fellahin, فلاحين, fallāḥīn) is a peasant, farmer or agricultural laborer in the Middle East and North Africa. The word derives from the Arabic word for ploughman or tiller. Ghawazi The Ghawazi (also ghawazee) dancers of Egypt were first a group of female traveling dancers, sometimes referred to as \\"Egyptian Gypsies\\", but the term then included all forms of poor dancers, and mainly those who entertain the upper-class and the rich. The ghawazi style was sometimes included in the Egyptian raqs sharqi sketches during the first half of the 20th century, and in turn to the Western forms of belly dance. While the performative raqs sharqi in urban Egypt was heavily influenced by Western styles such as classical ballet or Latin American dance, the term ghawazi in Egypt refers to the dancers in rural Egypt who have preserved the traditional 18th to 19th century style. The Arabic غوازي ghawāzī (singular غازية ghāziya) means \\"conqueror\\", as the ghaziya is said to \\"conquer\\" the hearts of her audience. Ghawazee Step Also referred to as the push step, the ghawazee step is characterized by the hands perpendicular to the floor, at waist height, pushing forward as the dancer steps; the back hip is pushed back in imitation of a horse. Hafla Hafla, from the Arabic meaning get-together, party, or ceremony. Outside of Arabic-speaking countries it began to be used after 2000 to refer to a gathering of belly dancers, often with a formal stage show and vendors. Karsilama Karsilamas (Greek: καρσιλαμάς, Turkish: karşılama), pronounced carshulamah, is a folk dance spread all over Northwest Asia Minor and carried to Greece by Asia Minor refugees. The term \\"karsilamas\\" comes from the Turkish word \\"karşılama\\" meaning \\"face to face greeting\\". The dance is still popular on Northwestern areas of Turkey, especially on wedding parties, festivals and so on. It can also refer to the 9/8 rhythm counted 2,2,2,3. Maya Hips Maya Hips is the movement of one hip in opposition to the other on a vertical plane. As one hip moves up, away from the body, down, and then the back to center; the other hip moves down, into the center, up, and then away from the body. This move is the opposite of the Egyptian Figure Eight. Ouled Nail The Ouled Naïl are a confederation of Amazigh tribes living in the Ouled Naïl Mountains of Algeria strongly influenced by the Arabs. The Ouled Naïl tribe also originated a style of music known as \\"Bou Saâda\\" music. In belly dancing, the term refers to a style of dance originated by the Ouled Naïl people. They are noted for their belly dancing. Raqs Baladi The folk style of Egyptian belly dance. From the Arabic Raqs meaning dance and Baladi meaning rural. It is more stationary than raqs sharqi, with little use of the arms, and the focus is on hip movements. It is performed to baladi or folk music. Typical costuming for performances of this dance style is a long dress covering the midriff. The most common version has a straight skirt with side slits, long sleeves which may be slit to the elbows, and a scooped or shirt- style neckline. A sash may be worn around the hips, and a headscarf is often also worn. A baladi-style performance may include the use of sagat, or the dancer may perform with a cane (assaya). Raqs Sharqi Raqs sharqi (Arabic: رقص شرقي), is the style of Egyptian belly dance that developed in the first half of the 20th century and is performed in cabarets and clubs and highly influenced by ballet, modern dance, and Latin dance. The term is derived from the Arabic raqs meaning dance and sharqi meaning of the east. The style is often considered the classical style of belly dance. Sa’idi A Sa'idi (Arabic: صعيدى) is a generic term used in Egypt to refer to a person from Upper Egypt (Arabic: صعيد مصر Sa'id). The word literally means \\"from Sa'id\\" (i.e. Upper Egypt), and can also refer to a form of music originating there, their style of dance, or to the dialect spoken by Sa'idis. Sa’idi dance is a folkloric dance (one of the baladi dances) from the Sa'id. The dance style includes energetic bouncy footwork, steps imitating horses, and frequently incorporates a stick or cane, called an Assaya (Arabic for stick). Sa’idi Step The Sa'idi step is similar to the Ghawazi step in that the hip is pushed backwards in imitation of a horse; however, in this step, one foot remains anchored while the other foot steps backwards and forwards. The arms echo the moving leg. Taqsim Taqsim (Arabic: تَقْسِيم / ALA-LC: taqsīm; Greek: ταξίμι taksimi, Turkish: taksim) is a melodic musical improvisation that usually precedes the performance of a traditional Arabic, Greek, Middle Eastern, or Turkish musical composition. The taqsim may often be played to introduce the belly dancer; the dancer may stay backstage until the rhythm instruments begin. Turkish Figure Eight The Turkish Figure Eight is the movement of the hips in opposition on a horizontal plane. As one hip moves forward, away from the body, back, and then the back to center; the other hip moves back, into the center, forward, and then away from the body. Uzun Hava Uzun hava comes from the Turkish for long air. This refers to a vocal solo in Turkish music that has no rhythm or measure, and is often improvised. It is conceptually equivalent to the Arabic taqsim. It is generally associated with folk music of the southeast of Turkey. Generally, the singer improvises with long sorrowful notes in the middle of the song. Wahda wa noss Arabic rhythm with two distinct parts meaning 'one and a half' used in Egyptian baladi dance. Zar Zār or Zaar (Arabic/Persian: زار) is a religious custom. It apparently originated in central Ethiopia during the 18th century, later spreading throughout East and North Africa. Zār custom involves the possession of an individual (usually female) by a spirit. It is also observed in Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, southern Iran, India and elsewhere in the Middle East. Zar Head Zar Head refers to the belly dance move where the head is rotated in circles throwing the hair in imitation of the zar ritual. Zill Zills, also sājāt (صاجات) in Arabic or finger cymbals, (from Turkish zil, \\"bell\\" or \\"cymbal\\") are tiny metallic cymbals used in belly dancing and similar performances.

McElfatrick (1854 - 28 September 1922) was an American architect who specialized in theaters. Life William H. McElfatrick was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1854, son of the theater architect John Bailey McElfatrick. He learned the architect's trade from his father. He moved to Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, and joined the William W. Boyington company. By 1880 he had moved to New York and was working with his father in J. B. McElfatrick & Son. His brother John M. McElfatrick (1853-1891) also joined the family firm. McElfatrick remained in New York after his father died in 1906, and continued to specialize in theaters, but moved the office to Brooklyn. The McElfatrick firm designed many theaters, and introduced innovations that included better floor layouts and sight lines, multiple exits and fire sprinkler systems. McElfatrick became known as the \\"father of the American theater architecture.\\" McElfatrick died at his home in Brooklyn, New York on 28 September 1922. Works The Gayety Theatre was completed in 1907 at 513 9th Street, NW, in Washington, D.C. The entrance on 9th Street was no wider than a store front, but led to a large complex that extended to 8th street. Inside and out the decor was eccentric and lavish. The three-story auditorium decorated in ivory and gold could seat 1,500, with a stage wide and deep. Arches above the boxed on each side of the stage held plaster figures of the muses by Ernest C. Bairstow (1876-1962). The theater originally was a member of the Columbia Circuit of Burlesque theaters. After going through many changes, the theater was torn down in November 1959. McElfatrick designed the Majestic Theatre in Jersey City, New Jersey, built by the Klein Amusement Company in 1907 and owned by Frank E. Henderson. The 2,300-seat theater has a Beaux Art neo-classical design. An electric marquee of art metal and glass roofing dominated the outside. The interior included a grand eight-foot wide staircase, neoclassical painted murals on canvas, a domed ceiling with allegorical Greek goddesses, pillars of faux marble and crystal chandeliers. The proscenium stage was wide. There were two balconies, twelve opera boxes, and a Wurlitzer piano-organ. Until 1917 the theater was used for light theater, before becoming a cinema. On 10 January 1910 the Columbia Amusement Company opened the Columbia Theatre, \\"Home of Burlesque De Luxe\\", at Broadway and 47th Street in Manhattan. The theater was designed by William H. McElfatrick and had a capacity of 1,385. The Empire Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland, opened in 1910 as a vaudeville house, designed by McElfatrick and the local architect Otto Simonson. It went through many changes in the years that followed, as a Yiddish theater, boxing arena, bingo house, burlesque theatre, parking garage and cinema.

The film's sets were designed by the art directors Robert Herlth and Heinrich Weidemann.

At the time when the film was made, Germany was keeping Denmark under military occupation but attempting a relatively conciliatory attitude towards the occupied Danes. Germany was also making an effort to keep good relations with the neutral Sweden. The theme of the film – made at a time when Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry kept tight control of the German film industry – fit well with these policy aims.

Developed as part of the AN/USD-2 surveillance system, the SD-2 was designed for truck launch using two solid rocket boosters; following launch, a piston engine provided propulsion. At the end of its mission, the drone would be recovered via parachute. Control was provided from a translateration system for navigation (similar to the much later differential GPS technology), which allowed the aircraft to steer on a pre-programmed course.Newcome 2004, p.74. The SD-2 was designed to use a modular sensor system, allowing equipment to be switched between missions according to requirements. Available payloads included cameras for either recovered or real-time photography, an AN/AAD-2 infrared sensor, AN/DPD-2 side looking airborne radar, or equipment for the dispensing of biological or chemical warfare agents from tanks mounted under the wings of the aircraft.

The film was acquired by Universal Pictures, released August 2020 and has a 98% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Red Penguins tells the wild forgotten true story of capitalism and opportunism run amok in Moscow shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was hailed by Deadline as “a remarkable—and funny—documentary that seems ripe for entry into this year’s Oscar race.” In 2018 Polsky completed the documentary In Search of Greatness. Told through the eyes of the greatest athletes of all time, In Search of Greatness is a cinematic journey into the secrets of genius. The film features original interviews with sports-world legends Wayne Gretzky, Pelé, and Jerry Rice. In April 2018. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is an early Oscar contender for the best documentary feature award, and that the film uses a mixture of \\"remarkable archival footage and talking-head interviews\\".

Background Like the rest of the tracks on Schoolboys in Disgrace, \\"No More Looking Back\\" describes the back story of Mr. Flash, the main character from the Preservation saga. In the song, Flash is seen \\"walking along a crowded street\\", where he keeps \\"seeing the things that remind [him] of [his former lover]\\".

Military Airplane display in Washington, D.C., U.S.A.R. requests Grahame-White as pilot United States Aeronautical Reserve asks Grahame-White to be one of the first pilots to demonstrate the effectiveness of an airplane for military usage. Grahame-White successfully flies airplane down the avenue at the Executive Offices location (considered a difficult maneuver requiring a skilled pilot) in Washington, DC in front of the several military departments with many leading military officers watching, and hundreds of Signal Corps officers timing speed.

Both the Boston Daily Globe and the United States Aeronautical Reserve's (U.S.A.R.'s) The Air-Scout covered Grahame-White landing an airplane near the War Office in Washington, D.C. in October 1910. It was a distance and speed demonstration display, with the U.S.A.R. requesting Grahame-White to perform the test in front of hundreds of military personnel that stood outside and watched as he successfully landed his airplane in a narrow street within a few minutes from a satisfactory distance. According to the Boston Daily Globe, \\". . . and within 10 minutes, had landed lightly on the narrow roadway between the White House and the war department, at the feet of General Leonard Wood and within a few yards of the window of President Taft's office.\\" The Boston Daily Globe mentioned General Nelson A. Miles stating, \\"I am convinced that one aeroplane would annihilate an entire fleet by dropping bombs upon the deck, or the more vital spot--their engine rooms by way of the funnels . . .\\", and Major General Leonard Wood, commander of the army spoke on how the escalation of airplane technology and the wanted airplane capabilities would be \\"fulfilled\\" in the future.\\"Use of Aeroplanes in War: Graham-White Landed in the Street Beside the War Office in Washington Without Trouble--General Leonard Wood and Gen Miles Tell How Aircraft May Affect Future Wars.\\" Boston (Daily) Globe, page 51, October 30, 1910.

First use of airplane by military in war is from the United States Aeronautical Reserve Although the U.S.A.R. had much bigger plans for many of their airplanes to be used by the U.S. military, the U.S. military did utilize at least one of their airplanes in a peacekeeping effort with two of the U.S.A.R. members, according to The Air-Scout's March 1911 issue: “On February 16 [1911], the General Staff of the United States Army accepted the service of Mr. Collier’s biplane offered by the U.S.A.R. On the same day, Major General Leonard Wood publicly announced that the craft would be ordered to the Mexican frontier. On the next day, for the first time in the history of man, an aeroplane was ordered to the scene of the battle, with instructions to patrol the Mexican border in order to preserve neutrality laws. Lieutenant Foulios, a trained United States Army aviator officer, stationed at Fort Sam Houston near San Antonio, Texas, was commanded to report for service on board the airplane. Phillip O. Parmalee, one of the Wright aviators, a lieutenant of the U.S.A.R., native of Michigan, volunteered his services to the government through the reserves which were accepted. He was also commanded to proceed to Texas.” Photos of this were published in The Air-Scout.The Air-Scout, Vol. 1., Issues 1-6, November 1910-April 1911, United States Aeronautical Reserve.)

Baker (born January 19, 1965) is an American perennial candidate from Tacoma, Washington. Baker, described by the Tacoma News Tribune as \\"a roadside flower salesman with a history of annoying elected officials,\\" has run for Pierce County Auditor, Washington state Auditor, United States Senator, Tacoma city council, and mayor of Tacoma, among other offices, but has never won a contest. He has been repeatedly arrested for speaking past his allotted time during public comment periods of the Tacoma city council, then refusing to yield the floor. On one occasion, in 1997, he continued his monologue after being booked into the Pierce County jail, even refusing to stop after jail guards left the door to his cell open \\"hoping he'd leave.\\" (According to another report of that incident, Baker refused to leave jail after having bail posted by an acquaintance as he'd learned his landlord had evicted him. Sheriff Mark French attempted to convince Baker to leave jail, but Baker chose to remain in his cell.) In the 2004 race for state auditor, the Washington State Republican Party nominated Baker as their candidate after efforts to recruit someone else failed, though later admitted they were unaware of his colorful past and had not properly vetted him. (Under Washington elections law at the time, candidates listing party affiliation had to have received endorsement from the party in question; under current state elections law candidates can list affiliation with any party whether approved by that party or not.) Another Washington perennial candidate, Richard Pope, attempted - unsuccessfully - to have Baker removed from the ballot. Baker ultimately lost the election with 32-percent of the vote. Baker's frequent electoral campaigns have been motivated by what he's explained is institutional corruption that has engulfed Tacoma municipal and Washington state government. In the 2004 election for Auditor he declared the \\"number one issue ... ought to be the attempts by the FBI to cover up the events surrounding Crystal Brame’s murder\\" (David Brame was a Tacoma chief of police who murdered his wife, Crystal, before killing himself) while, in his 2010 run for United States Senator, he opined that \\"Secretary of State Sam Reed and several County Auditors are manipulating the 2010 U.S. Senate election.\\" References External links *\\"Elect Will Baker Forever\\" political cartoon at Feed Tacoma, a community news site Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Tacoma, Washington Category:1965 births ","title":"Will Baker"},{"id":"42759037","text":"Forest Township is a township in Winnebago County, Iowa, in the USA.

It was a minor action between an augmented battalion of the Imperial Camel Corps on the one side and a score of Turkish troops plus some armed Bedouin on the other. The raid occasioned the first aeromedical evacuation in the British Army. The raid was the third of three actions fought by British forces seeking to recapture the Sinai Peninsula during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I. Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) cavalry and camelry traveled into the centre of the Sinai Peninsula to attack and push the last Turkish garrisons back into Palestine. Background British ships on the Mediterranean coast and the Gulf of Aqaba guarded the coast road via El Arish, and the road from Ma'an via Nekhl to the Suez Canal. Ottoman forces continued to occupy the area on the central way across the Sinai south from el Kossaima towards the Suez Canal, including Bir el Hassana and Nekhl. The raid General Archibald Murray, commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, ordered attacks against both Nekhl and Bir el Hassana, which lay north of Nekhl, between the Gebel Helal and the Gebel Yelleg.Gullett (1941), p.246)Cutlack (1941), p.53. Three columns of cavalry and camelry set out with the goal of all attacking on 18 February. One column set out from Serapeaum (possibly the vicinity of Ismailia), and another from Suez on 13 February 1917 to converge on Nekhl.Murray (1920), pp.112. Major J.R. Bassett, commanding 2nd Battalion (British), Imperial Camel Corps, together with the Hong Kong and Singapore (Mountain) Battery, marched from El Arish, via Magdhaba.Falls (1930), Vol. 1, p.277. This column reached Lahfan on the 16th, and on the 17th advanced from Magdhaba. At dawn the next morning they surrounded the Ottoman Army garrison at Bir el Hassana, which consisted of three officers and 19 other ranks, reinforced by armed Bedouin. The Ottoman troops surrendered, but the Bedouin fired on the British, shattering Lance Corporal McGregor's ankle. One of the Turks who surrendered was Nur Effendi, who had commanded the garrison at the unsuccessful British attack on Maghara on 15 October 1916. The troops searched Bir el Hassana and found 21 rifles, a few camels, and 2100 rounds of ammunition. After the surrender of Bir el Hassana, Bassett's force remained in position to capture any Ottoman force withdrawing back from Nekhl towards Bir el Hassana.Gullett (1941), pp.246–7.

Background G M McFarlane, a chartered accountant, audited the 1970 John Duthie Holdings Ltd financial statements, and through a simple mathematical error, resulted in John Duthie Holdings net worth being overstated by $38,000. At the same time, Scott Group Limited were considering making a takeover offer, and after reading the audited reports in question, valued the company at over $1 million, and offered to take over the company on the basis of two shares for every one share. However, just as the takeover was finalised, the mistake was discovered. As a result, Scott Group argued that it paid $38,000 too much for the shares, and sought compensation from the auditors for this amount. The auditors in response denied any liability for this mistake, on the basis there was no contractual relationship between the auditors and the takeover company, and neither did they owe Scott Group a duty of care for the mistake. Decision The Court of Appeal ruled that as J D Holdings financial position was so poor, it made a takeover by another company a strong possibility, and that as a result, the auditors owed Scott Group a duty of care. No money for damages was awarded, as the court ruled that it had not suffered any financial loss. Whilst the financial statements were overstated by $38,000, evidence suggested that the shareholders of John Duthie Holdings were unlikely to have accepted any offer lower than the two for one share swap that was offered. Furthermore, the evidence on hand was that Scott Group paid $263,885 less than what the company was worth. The auditor's disclaimer did not exclude liability to the general public, which Scott Group was, and presumably since this case, most auditors disclaimers now exclude liability to members of the public.

Biography Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Marie Van Hoesen was born in Boise, Idaho, the daughter of Enderse Van Hoesen and Freda Van Hoesen. She earned a B.A. from Stanford University in 1948. After graduation, she continued her studies in France at the Ecole des Beaux Arts de Fontainbleau (1948), the Académie Julian (1948-50), and the Académie de la Grande Chaumière (1948–50). In 1951, she enrolled at the California School of Fine Arts, where she studied under the painters David Park and Clyfford Still. Although Van Hoesen is best known for her animal portraits, her other subjects ranged from people to landscapes, still lives, and botanical subjects. She worked mainly in print media, especially etching, using drawings extensively for preparatory work. Her style is lively and playful, with attention to the telling detail. In the 1970s, she was diagnosed with depression; it severely affected her ability to draw for a time, and she began to keep a diary, which was published in 1975. During her lifetime she exhibited at museums and galleries across the United States. In the early 1980s, a traveling exhibition of her work was organized by the Art Museum Association; it toured the United States for three years. Another touring exhibition took place the year of her death. Her work won a number of awards, including a 1981 Award of Honor in Graphics from the San Francisco Arts Commission, and a 1993 Distinguished Artist Award from the California Society of Printmakers. Public collections holding her work include the New York Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Brooklyn Museum, the Butler Institute of American Art, the Cincinnati Art Museum, the El Paso Museum of Art, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Weisman Art Museum, Honolulu Museum of Art, the Oakland Museum of California, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The artist's print archive was given to the Portland Art Museum. A catalogue raisonné of her work was issued in 2011. Personal life In 1953, she married fellow artist Mark Adams. At their home in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood, where she lived for nearly 50 years, Van Hoesen and Adams hosted a weekly drawing group attended by artists such as Wayne Thiebaud and Theophilus Brown.

It is currently part of the Seal Bay Conservation Park. Description Nobby Islet is approximately south-west of Kingscote and about east of Point Ellen in Vivonne Bay and within of the coast at Seal Bay. The islet is reported as being cylindrical in shape with almost vertical sides and finished with a flat top. It is high and has an area of . The islet is difficult to access due to its location in shallow water adjoining a cliffed coastline that exposed to rolling seas and the fragile condition of its vertical cliff faces. A survey carried out by the responsible government agency in 1996 used a helicopter to access the islet's summit. Formation, geology and oceanography Nobby Islet may have been formed as recently as 6000 years ago due to the relatively shallow depth of the water surrounding it. As of 1996, the islet is reported as appearing to be entirely composed of a limestone known as Bridgewater Formation calcarenite. It is also observed that there was recent evidence of rockfalls due to the crumbly consistency of the calcarenite and that debris cones were present on its relatively sheltered northern side while any collapsed materials on its southern face had been washed away by wave action. The islet's summit was also reported as being 'gently terraced by resistant layers of calcrete that retain bands of sandy soil'. Nobby Islet is technically a sea stack. The islet is located in waters of a depth of about that partially conceal wave-cut platforms and that are subject to rolling seas. Flora and fauna As of 1996, the cliff faces were relatively un- vegetated. The islet's summit was occupied by clumps of Coast tussock-grass with a fringing shrubland dominated by Coast Daisy-bush. The 25 other species were identified including Dry land Tea-tree, Coast Beard-heath, Common correa, Cotton bush, Thyme Riceflower, pointed twinleaf, Black-anther Flax Lily, Common Wallaby Grass and Downy Dodder-laurel. The only animal life observed in 1996 was an Osprey nest located on the islet's northern side, white-faced storm petrels which were nesting in shallow burrows located over the entire summit and two species of lizard - the marbled gecko and the bull skink. Protected areas status Nobby Islet originally obtained protected area status as a fauna reserve under the former Fauna Conservation Act 1964 and then as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967. Since 1971, the waters surrounding the islet have been part of the Seal Bay Aquatic Reserve. As of 1996, it was described as being included in Seal Bay Conservation Park. As of 2012, the waters surrounding its shores are part of a restricted access zone located within the boundaries of the Southern Kangaroo Island Marine Park.

Leach has served as an officer and committee member of numerous New Zealand and international organisations concerned with archaeology and cultural heritage management, and has held honorary fellowships in various institutions. Early life and education Bryan Foss Leach was born 16 February 1942 at Waipukurau, New Zealand, and spent his formative years in Martinborough with his sister Josephine Michelle and their parents Bernard Joseph Leach and Thelma Adele Foss. He attended boarding school at Palmerston North Boys' High School, where he chose science subjects throughout, although he excelled more in sports ventures than in the classroom. He went on to play representative rugby for Manawatu in 1961 and represented Otago University in Boxing in 1962. Much of his life as a young adult was spent as a bushman: possum trapping, deer stalking, scrub-cutting, and working in shearing gangs. A chance attendance at an archaeological excavation being run by Les Groube at Karitane near Dunedin was the beginning of his career in archaeology. He graduated Bachelor of Arts Anthropology in 1966, and Masters of Arts (Hons) in 1969. The MA thesis was published in the same year.Leach, B.F. 1969.

Teaching Leach began his teaching career as an undergraduate tutor in the Anthropology Department at the University of Otago from 1967 and joined the academic staff as a Junior Lecturer in 1969. He gained full tenure in 1971, was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1978, and Associate Professor in 1986. He retired from teaching in 1988 when he moved to Wellington to work at the Museum of New Zealand. During his twenty years at Otago he was an inspirational teacher, who attracted overseas graduate students to Dunedin as well as supervising many local students who went on to have careers in archaeology. He taught courses on New Zealand and Pacific prehistory, the origins of civilisation, and archaeological methods, and ran laboratory classes and field schools. His weekly graduate seminar series encouraged vigorous debate. This was not always appreciated by visiting academics who, when invited to give a paper, found themselves strenuously challenged by students. = Archaeological laboratories = Foss Leach in the Archaeometry Laboratory, Otago University, 1982 Leach's strong commitment to archaeological science and archaeometry was fostered during his undergraduate years by early correspondence with, and encouragement from, Martin Aitken FRS of the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art in Oxford. Under Aitken's instruction and guidance he built a proton magnetometerAitken, M.J. (1960). Magnetic prospecting: The proton gradiometer. Archaeometry 3: 38–40.Aitken, M.J.and Tite, M.S. 1962.

He later spent two sabbatical years as a Senior Visiting Fellow at the Oxford Laboratory and as a Royal Society (Great Britain) Anglo- Australasian Visiting Fellow, in 1976 and 1983. He organised the first Archaeometry Conference outside the United Kingdom in 1980 in Christchurch. His first hand experience with the scientific facilities relating to archaeology at both Oxford and Bradford Universities persuaded him that something needed to be done to take the existing archaeological facilities in New Zealand out of the Stone Age. As a result, one of Leach's most notable, and perhaps now least recognised, contribution to archaeology was his development of the archaeological laboratories at Otago University. In 1968, an old army shed served the archaeologists as a laboratory. After moving to progressively larger buildings in 1972 and 1973, the archaeologists were finally allocated adequate space in the new building that was then to be called the Hocken Building. Leach helped develop the plan for the then state- of-the-art laboratories, including proper facilities for obtaining and displaying a comparative osteological collection, an archaeological conservation facility, and finally a laboratory devoted to archaeometry. This greatly expanded the opportunities for senior archaeology students to do MA thesis research based on more than visits to the library and minor projects of fieldwork. Provision was made in the new laboratory complex for student projects in archaeological remote sensing, transmission tube XRF analysis, radioactive source excitation XRF, and thermoluminescence analysis. Leach formed strong links with various external laboratories, which enabled students to take advantage of scientific facilities at the then Institute of Nuclear Sciences accelerator group, the Otago Department of Chemistry facility for Electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR), and the Lucas Heights Nuclear Physics Laboratory. He encouraged his students to publish their archaeometry projects, often jointly with the senior scientists whose external facilities were being used.

New Zealand Archaeological Association Monograph 17. Research =Archaeological fieldwork= Foss Leach ordering medical supplies by radio after repairing the transmitter, Taumako island, 1978 Leach has always had a strong commitment to 'area excavation', in the belief that the reconstruction of prehistory is best approached by first understanding the patterns of human culture in the synchronic dimension before turning attention to diachronic studies. This commitment partly arose from a then current practice of advance-face excavation in southern New Zealand, which he regarded as unduly destructive, and also the widespread use of exploratory test pit excavations through the Pacific and elsewhere. He had great admiration for André Leroi-Gourhan's area excavations at the Magdalenian hunters' site of Pincevent. This was to be the theoretical theme of his PhD dissertation, in which he proposed that a single human community could be used as a useful archaeological construct when building prehistory from archaeological excavations.See pp. 22–24, 288–319 Leach, B.F. 1976. Prehistoric communities in Palliser Bay, New Zealand. Unpublished PhD Thesis, Anthropology, University of Otago. His first excavation, jointly with his first wife, was at Oturehua in 1967. This was a stone tool quarry in Central Otago. The location of every stone flake was recorded in the 10x10m excavated area and they were later laid out in their original locations on a gridded floor in a laboratory. Cellulose glue was used to re-assemble flakes back on to their original cores to study the flaking process relating to prismatic core blade production.Leach, B.F. 1969.

Prehistoric Man in Palliser Bay. National Museum of New Zealand, Bulletin 21. He has always been interested in seeking to understand prehistoric communities as an operational archaeological unit, and this was reflected in his work in Palliser Bay. He then planned and launched a similar research programme in the Chatham Islands 1974–1975, which was carried on by his student Doug Sutton.Sutton, D.G. 1980. A culture history of the Chatham Islands. Journal of the Polynesian Society 89 (1): 67–94. The fieldwork in Palliser Bay involved close consultation with the local Maori of Ngati Hinewaka, with whom Leach has continued to maintain close connections. He was involved in their Waitangi Tribunal claim as a member of their Claims Committee and author of a major report on fishing rights.Leach, B.F. 2003. Depletion and loss of the customary fishery of Ngati Hinewaka: 130 years of struggle to protect a resource guaranteed under Article Two of the Treaty of Waitangi. Report presented to the Waitangi Tribunal, Document Wai-863-#A71. He had previously been instrumental in helping them secure the return of the land and associated buildings at Cape Palliser Lighthouse. From the mid-1970s, Leach's fieldwork took him beyond New Zealand. He participated in two archaeological surveys with Jim Specht for the Australian Museum, on Norfolk Island in 1976,Specht, J. 1984. Prehistoric archaeology of Norfolk Island. Pacific Anthropological Records 34. and in the Kandrian district of Southwest New Britain, Papua New Guinea in 1979.Specht, J., Lilley, I. and Normu, J. Radiocarbon dates from West New Britain, Papua New Guinea, Australian Archaeology 12:13–15. In 1977–1978 he carried out archaeological research on a Polynesian outlier in the Outer Eastern Solomon Islands with Janet Davidson, with a thorough survey and two major excavations in Taumako.Leach, B.F. and Davidson, J.M. 2008. The archaeology of Taumako: a Polynesian Outlier in the Eastern Solomon Islands. New Zealand Journal of Archaeology Special Publication. A rock shelter, Te Ana Tavatava, provided the basis for a cultural sequence of nearly 3000 years for Taumako, while the Namu burial mound provided a wealth of material culture from the last millennium. With the full agreement of the Taumako people, the human remains were taken to New Zealand for specialist study and much has been learned about individual life histories, diet, health and disease. The remains have since been repatriated to Solomon Islands. Foss Leach and Wilson who is wearing a 3,000-year-old amulet which he found. In the background is the school at Namu, Taumako island, renamed the \\"Foss Primary School\\" in his honour. The Taumako project was soon followed by survey and excavations on Kapingamarangi atoll in the Federated States of Micronesia with Graeme Ward.Leach, B.F. and Ward, G.K. 1981. Archaeology on Kapingamarangi Atoll: a Polynesian outlier in the Eastern Caroline Islands. Studies in Prehistoric Anthropology 16.

A review of archaeological research in the Izu and Ogasawara Islands. Man and Culture in Oceania. 6: 53–79. In his Pacific fieldwork, as in New Zealand, Leach has lived up to his conviction that fieldwork should always be published in full. Failure to publish beyond preliminary reports had dogged much of the professional archaeological fieldwork in New Zealand in the 1950s and 1960s. His commitment to publication led him to take on the position of business manager and de facto production manager of the New Zealand Journal of Archaeology for the 30 years of its existence, from 1979 to 2008. This involved a great deal of hands-on work, including packing and mailing out each issue. =Other research= Fieldwork was only part of Leach's contribution to archaeology. He has always approached the study of prehistoric communities from a strongly scientific perspective, which led him to explore methods for the identification of faunal remains and the sourcing and dating of lithic materials. He built a comparative faunal collection, particularly of fish remains, at Otago University and his methodology for fish identification is still widely followed in New Zealand and the Pacific.Leach, B.F. 1986. A method for analysis of Pacific island fishbone assemblages and an associated data base management system. Journal of Archaeological Science 13 (2): 147–159. He has published extensively on various aspects of obsidian in archaeology, not only on source characterisation and artefact identification,Leach, B.F. and Anderson, A.J. 1978. The prehistoric sources of Palliser Bay obsidian. Journal of Archaeological Science 5: 301–307. but also on basic properties, such as thermoluminescence,Leach, B.F. and Fankhauser, B. 1978. The characterization of New Zealand obsidian sources using thermoluminescence.

Minimum Mahalanobis distance functions and lithic source characterization by multi-element analysis. New Zealand Journal of Archaeology 4: 77–109. Another of his special research interests is the reconstruction of ancient diet from bone isotope chemistry,Leach, B.F., Quinn, C., Morrison, J. and Lyon G. 2003. The use of multiple isotope signatures in reconstructing prehistoric human diet from archaeological bone from the Pacific and New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Archaeology 23 (2001): 31–98. and he developed a simulation modelLeach, B.F., Quinn, C.J. and Lyon, G.L. 1996.

Testing the human factor: Radiocarbon dating the first peoples of the South Pacific. Journal of Archaeological Science, 38:29–44. =Research after \\"retirement\\"= Foss Leach with his three daughters Janey, Penny and Katie, at his investiture as Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, CNZM, December 2004 The final stage of Leach's professional career was spent at The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa after he retired from University teaching. In 1988, the then director, John Yaldwyn encouraged Leach to join the museum as an honorary curator and establish a specialised laboratory for Archaeozoology. This was a bold move at a time when archaeologists struggled to find places for long term storage of excavated faunal material, which could be used for advanced research in later years. Although the long term research potential of archaeofauna was widely recognised, museums were extremely reluctant to accept large collections of bones, shell and soil residues. The Archaeozoology Laboratory was founded to take care of such material. Leach set about building new comparative osteological and shell collections, and cataloguing a large body of existing archaeological faunal collections to a high curatorial standard. Concurrent with these basic functions he brought research funds into the museum and employed a small enthusiastic staff doing advanced research on the collections and publishing the results. This led to an avalanche of scientific papers and several books over the next 15 years on New Zealand and the tropical Pacific (see Links below). During this period at Te Papa he also ran a consultancy and undertook investigations into aspects of Waitangi Tribunal claims for the Crown Law Office and Maori iwi organisations. He contributed expert evidence on four separate claims before the Waitangi Tribunal between 1989 and 2003: the Ngāi Tahu claim,Bathgate, M.A. The archaeological and early documentary record concerning Maori fishing in the South Island; including reference to two reports by Dr Foss Leach.

He began attending night classes in electronics to obtain an amateur radio licence (ZL2JKP) and has since earned the DXCC award from the American Amateur Radio League. For a time he ran a private radio station for the benefit of residents of Ngakuta Bay in the Marlborough Sounds. He continues to write and publish, but at a greatly reduced rate.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Matane, Quebec. Matane was originally ordered as Stormont in October 1941 as part of the 1942–1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 23 December 1942 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec and launched 29 May 1943. Her named was changed to Matane in 1942. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 22 October 1943 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in St. Margaret's Bay and Pictou, Matane joined escort group EG 9 based out of Derry, being made Senior Officer's Ship on arrival.

On 6 June 1944, Matane was one of eleven Canadian frigates assigned to the Invasion of Normandy. Members of a boarding party from Matane which accepted the surrender of a German submarine depot ship off the coast of Norway, seen aboard a surrendered German submarine, in Loch Eriboll, Scotland, May 1945 While operating off Brest, Matane was hit by a German glider bomb launched by a Dornier Do 217 on 20 July 1944. Three of her crew were killed and the ship was badly damaged, losing propulsion. Matane was towed by back to Plymouth. She was eventually brought to Dunstaffnage, Scotland to begin eight and half months repair, reappearing in April 1945. After working up at Tobermory, she escorted convoy JW 67 to North Russia. While en route, she was detached from the convoy to escort fourteen surrendered U-boats from Trondheim to Loch Eriboll. After completing one round trip to Gibraltar escorting a convoy, Matane began her journey to Esquimalt via Derry and Halifax, arriving in July. She remained there until being paid off 11 February 1946. She was sold to Capital Iron & Metals Ltd. of Victoria, British Columbia in 1947 for stripping and her hulk was used as part of a breakwater at Oyster Bay, British Columbia.

Early years Born in Middletown, Connecticut, she was the daughter to William Wheeler. She developed an aptitude for literary works at an early age, writing and singing verses before age 12. These first songs were about God and nature. She memorized entire books, including The Shipwreck, The Lady of the Lake, Lalla- Rookh, The Bride of Abydos, and The Corsair. At the age of 16, she moved with her parents to Canandaigua, New York and married Oliver Peirson two years later. Career With her husband, Peirson moved to the western portion of Liberty Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania in 1821. Suffering from loneliness and seclusion at their rural home in the woods of the Allegheny Mountains, she began to write. For many years, her children were financially dependent on her efforts. She was a prolific author, chiefly for magazines and newspapers, her published poems filling more than a thousand common octavo pages. Though Peirson wrote more prose than poems, her prose papers were not collected. Her writings were often about nature. Peirson published two volumes of poems: \\"Forest Leaves,\\" in 1846 and \\" The Forest Minstrel,\\" in 1847. In 1849, she edited the Lancaster Literary Gazette; she was also the chief writer for the Ladies' Garland, a periodical for women which flourished in the 1840s. She contributed prose and verse to the Southern Literary Magazine and The New Real. In 1853, Peirson settled in Adrian, Michigan where she died in 1862.

Early life Quinn was born in Dublin, Ireland where she graduated from the Grafton Academy of Fashion Design in 1986. She grew up in Howth, and worked as a designer for Irish and English clients before relocating to New York in 1995. Career Quinn began her career in 1985 working as an intern with Willy Smith. She then worked with a British manufacturer who designed clothing for retailers including British Home Stores, Marks & Spencer, and Topshop. In 1995, Quinn moved to New York and began designing for John Roberts Corporation a supplier to Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Macy's and Dillards. She then began working as a designer for brands including Perry Ellis and Bill Blass. In 2005, she launched Quinn New York Inc., which includes her eponymous collection. Quinn's designs are aimed at women in their mid-thirties or older looking for contemporary, age appropriate clothing. – a market that has not been well served. She estimates that 45 percent of her customer base is in southern cities, such as Atlanta and Dallas where women tend to dress up more often and want colorful clothing. \\"Women in their 30s and 40s look better than ever, and they want clothing that looks stylish and feminine. She has been praised by influential magazines such as Women's Wear Daily and Fashion Manuscript, which reported: \\"Quinn has produced a product that fits a woman's body well, is age appropriate and still has a great sense of style and a contemporary look.\\" The Sunday Independent has also praised her clothing designs. Throughout her career, Quinn has collaborated with many brands. Working in association with New Balance to raise breast cancer awareness, Quinn constructed a gown made entirely of shoe material to be worn by Miss USA. In 2011 she helped raise money for a cancer research foundation. In 2013 Quinn constructed a dress made predominantly from parts of sunglasses by Randolph Engineering which was then worn by singer Nadia Turner live at The Hard Rock Cafe in Boston. In May 2013, Quinn launched her first handbag collection consisting of twelve embellished bags made as a tribute to ‘Old Hollywood’. Some of the bags in the collection included \\"Lady Eve\\", \\"Lady Grace\\" and \\"Lady Oscar\\". InStyle Magazine chose the \\"Gabrielle\\" clutch as the best evening wear bag. It featured a lambskin lining and was embellished with over 130 square-cut crystals. As an avid philanthropist, Quinn partnered with several stay-at-home mothers, living in India, to create the collection. The women completed piecework for the bags which was shipped to a factory for final assembly. As an example, \\"The Lady Monroe\\" handbag featured over 200 seashells, hand-collected, cut and shaped by these women. This arrangement offered single mothers and stay-at-home women an opportunity to contribute financially to their households. Quinn has worked with celebrity clients including Hannah Storm, Rachael Ray, Sarah, Duchess of York as well as department stores including Macy's and Lord and Taylor. Irish Rock Violinists Sephira also frequently wear custom-made designs for their performances. Jacqueline has also designed and fitted Couture pieces for Robert F Kennedy's daughter,Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. The singer, Estelle, was also dressed by Jacqueline for the 2012 Grammy’s. The following year Jacqueline was asked to design something fabulous for Billy Vera who won a Grammy for his song writing for Ricky Nelson and Dolly Parton to name a few. In 2014, Quinn was on the judging panel for the Design for Brad Smith competition which offered young, emerging designers the chance to spearhead a collection for NFL Philadelphia Eagles player Brad Smith. Winner Kassie Haji was crowned at an award ceremony in Chelsea during New York Fashion Week 2014. Jacqueline was the head Designer with Jessica Simpson and Guess, and when Morris Goldfarb, CEO of G-III bought DKNY he asked Jacqueline to be the head Designer for the dress division. Additionally, she was the creative Director for Betsey Johnson over the past two years. Jacqueline’s new collection was launched in New York and Europe earlier this year with couture pieces available online and exclusively from Om Diva Boutique, Dublin. With all of her experience Jacqueline is now focused on creating the new collection and remains a creative consultant with major brands in fashion on a platform in the global arena. Jacqueline is currently studying for her masters at the Grafton Academy / American College, Dublin and for a certificate in the visual arts from Harvard.

It was owned by Don Catalino Rodriguez, Sariaya’s town Presidente (Mayor during the American occupation period) from 1908 to 1909. The house occupies an entire block near the church park. Its main entrance faces south along Calle Daliz and is bounded by Calle Rizal on the west and Quezon Avenue (formerly Calle Talavera) on the east. This house has already been transformed into a Museum and visitors can choose to wear period costumes for reasonable fees and pose for souvenir photos. Don Catalino Rodriguez Ancestral House is listed as one of the Ancestral Houses in the Philippines, under Region IV-A. History Villa Sariaya was built in 1922. The house was said to be a place for important occasions during its heyday. According to historical accounts, one of those events that were held in the house was in honor of President Manuel Quezon. Claro M. Recto, a native of Tiaong, Quezon, was also mentioned as one of the important guests who visited the house in one of its sponsored events. In the 1990s, the house was restored to its former grandeur through the effort of Vicente Rodriguez, one of the eight children of the owners. After Vicente Rodriguez, his fourth child Rebecca purchased and restored the house. Today, Villa Sariaya is owned by the Veloso Family. Architectural features detail of window of Catalino Rodriguez house The Don Catalino Rodriguez House or today known as Villa Sariaya was built in the style of Bahay na Bato, a 19th-century townhouse. A bahay na bato, literally translated as stone house, is characterized by stone or brick supported lower level and a hard wooden upper level. From the entrance, the grand staircase with wood balusters is the main feature that greets every visitor. The rooms of the house are finished with beautiful Art Nuoveau wall paintings and wood carvings while the bathrooms were equipped with European and American bathroom fixtures. The main receiving area on the second floor has high ceiling and is accented by intricately designed lattices. All the big sliding windows of the second floor are decorated with colorful stained glasses with louvered panels. The louvered panels are installed to minimize the entry of sunlight during high noon. At the east side of the house is a big veranda with a picturesque view of the town. To complement the grandiose design of the mansion, original furniture and fixtures were imported from Europe and United States. It is said that expert carpenters from the province of Batangas and Pampanga used top- quality species of hardwood in finishing the interiors of the mansion. At the exterior of the house, intricate carvings decorates the corbels, brackets and pilasters. A simple yet elegant roof parapet decorated with five pointed stars can be seen on the top of the house.

It supports the full lifecycle: conceptual, utilization, support and retirement stages. Along with the integration of all lifecycle disciplines including, program management, systems and design engineering, verification and validation, deployment and maintenance into one framework. LML was originally designed by the LML steering committee. The specification was published October 17, 2013. The purpose behind the language is to replace predecessor languages, such as UML and SysML that overcomplicate the systems engineering process. LML uses common language to define its modeling elements such as entity, attribute, schedule, cost, and relationship.  Overview  LML communicates cost, schedule and performance to all stakeholders in the system lifecycle. LML combines the logical constructs with an ontology to capture information. SysML is mainly constructs and has a limited ontology, while DoDAF MetaModel 2.0 (DM2) only has an ontology. Instead LML simplifies both the constructs and ontology to make them more complete, but still easier to use. There are only 12 primary entity classes. Almost all of the classes relate to each other and themselves with consistent words, i.e., Asset performs Action. Action performed by Asset.Dr. Steven Dam and Dr. Warren Vaneman, \\"Lifecycle Modeling Language Tutorial\\", Presentation at SEDC 20142014-04-06 SysML uses object oriented design, because it was designed to relate systems thinking to software development. No other discipline in the lifecycle uses object oriented design and analysis extensively. LML captures the entire lifecycle from cradle to grave. Systems Engineers have identified complexity as a major issue. LML is a new approach to analyzing, planning, specifying, designing, building and maintaining modern systems. LML focuses on these 6 goals: 1\\\\. To be easy to understand 2\\\\. To be easy to extend 3\\\\. To support both functional and object oriented approaches within the same design 4\\\\. To be a language that can be understood by most system stakeholders, not just Systems Engineers 5\\\\. To support systems from cradle to grave 6\\\\. To support both evolutionary and revolutionary changes to system plans and designs over the lifetime of a system  History  The LML Steering Committee was formed in February 2013 to review a proposed draft ontology and set of diagrams that forms the LML specification. Contributors from many academic and commercial organizations provided direct input into the specification, resulting in its publication in October 2013. Presentations and tutorials were given at the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) Systems Engineering Conference (October 2013) and the Systems Engineering in DC (SEDC) in April 2014. A predecessor to LML was developed by Dr. Steven H. Dam, SPEC Innovations, as part of a methodology called Knowledge-Based Analysis and Design (KBAD). The ontology portion was prototyping in a systems engineering database tool. Ideas on how to better implement it and the development of key LML diagrams (Action and Asset) were part of their Innoslate product development from 2009 to present.  Ontology  Ontologies provide a set of defined terms and relationships between the terms to capture the information that describes the physical, functional, performance, and programmatic aspects of the system. Common ways for describing such ontologies are \\"Entity\\", \\"Relationship\\", and \\"Attribute\\" (ERA). ERA is often used to define database schemas. LML extends the ERA schema with \\"Attributes on Relationship\\", a feature that can reduce the number of required \\"Relationships\\", in the same way that \\"Attribute\\" reduce the number of required \\"Entities\\" in ERA. In alignment with the first goal of LML, \\"Entity\\", \\"Relationship\\", \\"Attribute\\", and \\"Attribute on Relationship\\" have equivalent English language elements: noun, verb, adjective and adverb. Entity (noun) An entity is defined as something that is uniquely identifiable and can exist by itself. There are only 12 parent entities in LML: Action, Artifact, Asset, Characteristic, Connection, Cost, Decision, Input/Output, Location, Risk, Statement and Time. Several child entities have been defined to capture information that stakeholders need. The child entities have the attributes and relationships of the parents plus additional attributes and relationships that make them unique. Child entities include: Conduit (child of Connection), Logical (child of Connection), Measure (child of Characteristic), Orbital (child of Location), Physical (child of Location), Requirement (child of Statement), Resource (child of Asset), and Virtual (child of Location). Every entity has a name or number or description attribute or combination of the three to identify it uniquely. The name is a word or small collection of words providing an overview of information about the entity. The number provides a numerical way to identify the entity. The description provides more detail about that entity. Attribute (adjective) The attributes work in the same way an adjective. Entities (the nouns) can have names, numbers, and description attributes. The inherent characteristic or quality of an entity is an attribute. Every attribute has a name that identifies it uniquely within an entity. Attributes names are unique within an entity, but may be used in other entities. The name provides an overview of information about the attribute. The attribute data type specifies the data associated with the attribute. Relationship (verb) The relationship works the same way a verb connects nouns or in this case the entities. The relationships enable a simple method to see how [entities] connect. For example, when connecting an action to a statement, LML uses “traced from” as the relationship: an Action is traced from a Statement. The inverse relation of traced from is “traced to.” Relationships are defined in both directions and have unique names with the same verb. The standard parent child relationship is decomposed by and its inverse is decomposes. Relationship names are unique across the whole schema. Attributes on Relationships (adverb) Classic ERA modeling does not include \\"attributes on relationships\\", but is included in LML. In terms of the English language, an \\"attribute on a relationship\\" is like an adverb, helping to describe the relationship. Analogous to the way in which attributes relate to entities the \\"attribute on a relationship\\" has a name that is unique to its relationship, but need not be unique across other relationships.

Innoslate implements LML and enables translation to UML, SysML, DoDAF 2.0, and other languages. \\\\- 3DExperience platform is the enterprise software platform that fully supports LML modeling concepts.

The Pantages Playhouse Theatre is a former vaudeville theatre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The two- storey building features a decorative façade with a lit marquee across the front, as well as classical decorative elements such as columns, brackets, frieze and cornice. The building continues to feature original interior layout and original lobby decor such as marble sheathing and decorative plaster ceiling. Of the 75 theatres once found in Pantages' chain, the theatre in Winnipeg is one of the few that have survived.  History  Built in 1913-14 and opened on 9 February 1914 as the Pantages Theatre, the building is located in Winnipeg's Exchange District. The theatre was originally the ninth theatre built in the Pantages chain of eighty-six theatres. The theatre was designed by architects George W. Northwood and B. Marcus Priteca and built for the Pantages Company. The company, a major American vaudeville chain, built the facility to present live theatrical, musical and vaudeville performances. Winnipeg was a proving ground for performers. Alexander Pantages was quoted as saying, \\"all my acts originate in Winnipeg and move around the circuit.\\" In 1923, the theatre company moved to the Capitol Theatre, and the city of Winnipeg acquired the building, renaming it Playhouse Theatre and using it as a venue for live theatre. The last vaudeville show in the Pantages Theatre was 23 June 1923. The conversion to live theatre was not successful, and it eventually reverted to a format of vaudeville, tabloid musicals and motion pictures. The Royal Winnipeg Ballet made its premier performance on the building's stage in June 1940, and continued there until the Manitoba Centennial Concert Hall was constructed in 1967. The City Finance Committee sold the building in 1943 to a new owner intent on using it for vaudeville and motion pictures, but the city seized it for taxes in 1945. In 1948, the theatre began to feature amateur performers and spawned the Manitoba Theatre Centre in 1956. In the 1980s, the theatre's auditorium was repainted and the seating and draperies were replaced by salvage from a cinema. In 1993, under a tripartite agreement with the Province and the Federal Governments, the City of Winnipeg acquired the Main Street frontage and added a new entrance and lobby to the theatre, as well as adding improvements to the backstage. The Performing Arts Consortium of Winnipeg, Inc. assumed responsibility for the management of the theatre in February 1998. The City of Winnipeg agreed to sell the theatre to Alex Boersma and Lars Nicholson in 2019 for $530,000, although the sale was held up on account of negotiations for easements to retain a monument to the 1919 Winnipeg general strike on the corner of Main Street and Market Avenue. In July 2020, the theatre was then sold to the Performing Arts Coalition (PAC) for $1, with Boersma's company retaining a slice of land alongside the theatre for housing development. PAC intends to raise between $10 million and $15 million to restore the historic venue and install a management team to operate it.

Background Mrs Shivas was a trustee of a family trust established by her husband Mr Shivas. Mr Shivas also ran a separate company involved in selling airplanes. As a result of the company experiencing financial difficulties and being unable to service its debts, the principal creditor, the BNZ, asked for the company to provide extra security, namely for the family trust to give a guarantee over the company's debts as well as grant a mortgage over the Shivas family home. The trustees, reluctant to give such a guarantee, which included the family home, ultimately gave the guarantee after the BNZ said they would appoint receivers to the company if the guarantee was not given. The trustees had access to independent legal advice at the time. Unfortunately, these guarantees only delayed the inevitable, as 18 months later, the company was placed into receivership, with the receivers seeking to enforce the trust's guarantee as well as the mortgage over the family home. The trustees tried to set aside the guarantees on the grounds of duress, even though they had not raised this issue once with the BNZ in the 18 months that had passed since it was signed. The trustees got an interim injunction in the meantime, preventing the BNZ enforcing the guarantee. Decision The court ruled that the trustees did not have to give the guarantee at the time, as they could alternatively have refused to grant the guarantee. The BNZ's threat of placing the company into receivership was held to not be illegitimate pressure. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not protest duress at the time of signing, nor during the following two years. As a result, the court held that the trust's guarantee was enforceable.

One reason for this is to distinguish him from two other Osaka-based ukiyo-e artists who shared the same gō: Shungyōsai I (c. 1760–1823; fl. 1790s–1820s) and his son Shungyōsai II (n.d.–1867; fl. 1820s–1860s).Keyes & Mizushima 1973, 275 Works by Shungyōsai Hokusei belong to the permanent collections of museums such as the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the Royal Ontario Museum, Central Saint Martins Museum and Study Collection, the Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum of Waseda University.

In 1807, however, he was adopted by his uncle, a performer of traditional Japanese dance, and at age 15 he became the apprentice of kabuki actor Nakamura Utaemon III. As a kaneru yakusha, Shikan II was highly versatile, capable of performing a wide variety of male and female roles, often assuming multiple roles within the same performance. He was particularly admired for his dancing, his roles in jidaimono history plays, and his \\"large... stature... fine eyes and good features.\\"Shōriya 2013 He used several stage names throughout his career, including Nakamura Tōtarō (1811–1813), Nakamura Tsurusuke I (1813–1825), Nakamura Utaemon IV (1836–1852), as well as Nakamura Shikan II which he took in 1825. He was also associated with the poetry names Kanjaku and Shijaku, and the guild name Narikomaya.Shōriya 2013 Shikan II's career was divided between Osaka and Edo, and despite his popularity on the Kamigata stage, he apparently wished to be more associated with the Edo theatre.Shōriya 2013 He appears in prints by various artists, including Utagawa Kunisada, Utagawa Kunihiro, Utagawa Toyokuni and Shunbaisai Hokuei.

His appearance is that of a samurai, his hair styled in a topknot, his feet bare. Her wears a short, bright red kimono decorated with thin white vertical stripes. Over this, he wears a simple grey jacket whose only decoration is a flower motif family crest, which may be a plum blossom variant.See examples of plum design kamon at the World of Kamon website. His arms have been removed from the sleeves of his haori which hang down at his sides, and he has a sageo string holding back the long sleeves of his kimono. Both of these are intended to increase his mobility, particularly in combat. The figure stands outdoors at the base of a set of stone steps with no visible detail aside from some undergrowth and rocks. He looks off to his right, which is to say away from the other two characters in the triptych. His face has a serious expression, and he holds a long unsheathed sword in front of him with both hands.

Prior to accepting, Mrs Moffat was advised by her husband's solicitor to get legal advice, but declined to do so. She signed an acknowledgement confirming this. Mrs Moffat subsequently came to her senses and tried to have this one sided agreement set aside due to it being an unconscionable bargain.

Both claim the credit alone for the success of their popular purple pills. When their quarreling began to threaten the well being of the company, the firm’s lawyer suggests a rather odd solution. He would deal each partner a poker hand, with the understanding that the loser would serve as the other’s butler for an entire year. The outcome of the wager supplies the fodder for the farce.The Nation, March 26, 1914, p. 341 Reception > The new play by Edward Peple, which opened at Frazee's Longacre Theatre last > week, has suffered perhaps from the enthusiastic encomiums of the daily > press.

The play cannot, however, be held responsible if it > fails to match exactly the promise held out by critics who, after a > succession of disastrous failures, were perhaps inclined to be over- > indulgent in the presence of an undeniable success. > Mr. Peple has conceived of an excellent idea, the innate absurdity of which > only commends it for farcical purposes.

A pair > of sixes in the hand of George B. Nettleton gives him the advantage, and > enables the author in the second act to present to us T.

The play has one conspicuous merit in that the > interest increases throughout and the last act is the best of the three. > There are moments of dullness, notably in those scenes in which Nettleton‘s > wife predominates, but there are a number of laughable situations and many > good lines, and the climax, in which the subtle Boggs John, under the > inspiration of his astute fiancée (well played by Miss Ann Murdock), > delivers himself from servitude by his attentions to his master's wife, is > ingenious.

It was the first Australian play to be adapted for Australian TV.Jane Connors, 'Vernon, Barbara Mary (1916–1978)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 2002, accessed online 5 June 2016. Plot The play is set at a house in Bondi Beach belonging to the Donnellys, an upwardly mobile family who are bookmakers at Randwick Racecourse. The younger son, Joe, has troubles with his bride, Kate, a woman from a \\"good\\" family. Joe's brother Ben is in love with Kate. This leads to a fight between Joe and Ben. Background Vernon said she was inspired to write it when working as a radio announcer for 2NZ Inverell. She would read out ads for the local bookie which would say \\"do your punting under the multi-coloured umbrella\\". She thought about umbrellas and how they protected you from the light - just as some people can't see the light (their own motives) and have trouble clarifying their thought and action. \\"But don't think it throbs with psychology,\\" said Vernon. \\"It's a comedy drama - a family play about ordinary people.\\" The role of Ben was specifically written for the actor Con Fardouly.\\"A Bookie's Ad Led to a Play\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 6 November 1957 Theatre History The play won second place in a 1957 contest for new plays, coming second to The Shifting Heart.The Age 19 February 1957 p3 It was performed by amateur groups in the towns of Inverell, in the 2NZ drama club, which Vernon co-founded. It then had a run at the Little Theatre in Melbourne, before being given a professional production at the Theatre Royal in Sydney starting 9 November 1957. The Sydney Morning Herald called it \\"much too slight a piece to keep the critical thunderstorms off... but sections of Saturday's first night audience certainly enjoyed its glossy magazine superficialities.\\" The production transferred to the Comedy Theatre in Melbourne the following month. The play had a different ending for its Sydney and Melbourne run. The Passionate Pianist Vernon later wrote a prequel about the same family, The Passionate Pianist. This screened on the ABC. 1958 TV adaptation An adaptation of the play was produced for Australian television in 1958. It was broadcast on the first night the ABC aired from their new studios at Gore Hill, New South Wales Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. According to Filmink, \\"It took a genuine act of will to produce local stories for television and sometimes people were punished for doing so\\", giving Multi Coloured Umbrella as an example. =Cast= *Edward Smith as Kevin *Georgie Sterling as Gloria *Ken Wayne as Joe *Deryck Barnes as Ben *Amber Mae Cecil as Katie =Production= The play was broadcast live on 29 January 1958 on ABC's Sydney station from the Sydney studios at Gore Hill. It was broadcast on the night the Gore Hill Studios opened. The bulk of the play was done live with some prerecorded scenes shot on location at Bondi Beach. The play was selected by ABC's head of drama Neil Hutchinson. It was chosen to broadcast on the ABC the night the new £620,000 Gore Hill studios were opened. Chairman of the ABC Sir Richard Boyer said \\"it is our greatest hope to make a contribution to Australian life and culture. We want to provide a medium to spread what is the genius of Australians.\\" =Reception= It was advertised as \\"the exciting drama about present-day Sydney.\\" The Australian Woman's Weekly called it \\"an excellent production\\". =Political controversy= The play was denounced by MLA W. R. Lawrence who said it \\"had all the evil elements one can imagine\\" and showed hysterical scenes, blasphemy of a low type and an immoral level of entertainment... If this is persisted in we can only expect to have difficult times, and unsettled and unhinged minds among our people.\\" There were calls of complaint to the station, one called claiming an actor said \\"Jesus, mama\\". This was denied by ABC's head of drama Neil Hutchinson who said the word was not in the script. The chairman of the ABC, Richard Boyer, said he did not feel the broadcast could have offended public taste. \\"The version tonight was abridged from the stage presentation,\\" said Boyer. \\"The play is of the type of offering we hope to give and we hope will be accepted as worthwhile by the viewing public.\\" Hutchinson said \\"the play concerns a warm-hearted Christian Australian family. They are a bit rough and uncouth but their true solid Christian values emerge as the play progresses. Australia is just coming into its own in the drama field, which such plays as Summer of the Seventeenth Doll, The Shifting Heart and this play. In America top playwrights like Tennessee Williams are using realism to achieve authenticity in their plays. The Australian plays are doing this to but unlike the Americans and some of the prominent French authors they do not end on a note of despair.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald wrote an editorial calling Lawrence \\"an unmitigated bore\\" and Vernon \\"a serious playwright\\", claiming Lawrence was motivated by a desire for personal publicity. Lawrence denied this. Other church leaders and critics also complained about the play. One writer to the Herald called it \\"common and vulgar\\", another \\"sordid and moronic and in no way reflected the Australian way of life as most of us know it\\"; one said it would \\"drag Australia's name further into the gutter\\" and asked \\"why must everyone present the Australian scene in the degrading manner of Rusty Bugles, The Doll, Shifting Heart and Multi Coloured Umbrella. Other writers defended the play George F. Kerr, who did the adaptation, defended the play in a letter to the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, claiming that \\"It is perfectly possible for a play to be good and yet give offence to some... The writer of a good play is likely to have broken new ground, either in thought or technique, to have given the audience a fresh vision on a scene as seemingly familiar as a Bondi family group. But many people could do without this fresh vision; they resent being told that whereas they thought the world was flat, it is in fact round.\\" He argued that the Donnellys of the play \\"are not the cosy Mr and Mrs Everybody of Bondi that many viewers may have expected to see on their screens see and, in all honesty, be bored by. The Donnellys are closer to the truth; like all of us from time to time, they are people in trouble.... Certainly this is not a cosy picture of the neighbours. But which is better? To lie about .them or, knowing the truth about their trouble, to be glad for their sake that they emerged from it?\\" The play was kinescoped for Melbourne broadcast in February 1958. However, the planned Melbourne broadcast did not happen, as the kinescope recording (\\"telerecording\\") that was made of the broadcast was said to be \\"poor quality\\". The play was instead broadcast on Melbourne radio. Radio adaptation A version was also produced for Australian radio during 1958. There were versions in 1962 and 1969.

Homer calls it an \\"equal,\\" rather than a sequel because the story happens during the same timeframe as the first book. Today, it is one of the most often picked community/library reads in the United States. It is also studied in many school systems around the world. The Coalwood Way (2000) is followed by Sky of Stone (2002), and preceded by October Sky (1998).  Plot summary  It is now 1959. The Rocket Boys are still perfecting their handmade rockets and, as high school seniors, preparing for their futures. Homer is determined to prove to his father that he is college material, but with the mine perilously close to running out of coal and shutting down, the prospects for the future of any of Coalwood's children is bleak. Miners have lost their jobs and homes, public services have been cut to residences in the outlying areas, and Homer's father is faced with initiating an extremely dangerous and controversial new mining method in order to save the town and the mine from oblivion. Homer's mother feels increasingly cut off from her husband and the townspeople as her role as the mine superintendent's wife places her at odds with the wives of the union workers. Optimism is hard to come by in the bleak winter months of the last year of the 1950s, and Homer is overcome with an overriding sense of gloom with his future so uncertain. The faith and hope of these hard working people, however, form the basis for an uplifting memoir, as Sonny and his friends resurrect the Spirit of Christmas when Coalwood need it the most.  Characters  *Homer \\"Sonny\\" Hickam, Jr. is the fun main kid and narrator of the story. He is 8 years old at the beginning of the story, and serves as the unspoken leader of the Rocket Boys. He is very nearsighted and requires glasses. Jim is his star athlete brother, and Homer Hickam, the mine superintendent, is his dad. Elsie Lavender Hickam is Homer Sr.'s wife and their mom. *Quentin Wilson is an intelligent member of the Rocket Boys and the person who does the most math out of the entire group. Quentin carries around a suitcase stuffed with books wherever he goes and finds excuses to get out of gym class. He is excitable and often confounds the other members and townspeople with his advanced vocabulary when jumpy. *Jimmy \\"O'Dell\\" Carroll is small and excitable, the most emotional member of the group. His father drove the town garbage truck, allowing O'Dell access to many useful items, frequently scrounged to further the group's efforts. He is always scheming ways of making money, from the failed iron scrap attempt—which took an entire summer, yielded a net loss of one dollar, not counting the destruction of borrowed equipment, and almost killed Sonny—to the profitable harvesting of ginseng. *Sherman Siers has a physically weakened left leg as a result of polio, but does not let it slow him down. He is also the most observant and practical member of the team. *Roy Lee Cooke is Sonny's best friend. He teaches Sonny something about girls. In the follow-up memoir titled The Coalwood Way, it is revealed that he is known as The Big Creek Lovemaster. Roy Lee also knows the moonshiner in town, John Eye, who provides the boys with the alcohol needed for their special propellant they call Zincoshine. *Willie \\"Billy\\" Rose is a member of the Rocket Boys who joins the group about a year after it is founded. He has excellent eyesight and can find rockets very well. He is the best runner in the group. *Miss Riley is a chemistry and physics teacher at Big Creek High School who inspires the Rocket Boys to compete in the National Science Fair. She gives Sonny a book called Principles of Guided Missile Design that is extremely useful to the Rocket Boys in the future. She also orchestrates the Rocket Boys' entry into the National Science Fair. She is diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma shortly before Sonny leaves for the science fair. At first her affliction goes into remission, but later she dies of her disease. *Jake Mosby is a womanizing alcoholic who helps the BCMA in paying off debts. Jake is a mining engineer. He also introduces them to a writer of a small newspaper, Basil Oglethorpe. He later settles down a bit and starts dating Miss Riley for a period of time, trying to be dependable for her. *Basil Oglethorpe is the writer of a small newspaper called the McDowell County Banner. He is in charge of the BCMA's publicity. *Mr. Ferro is in charge of a group of company machinists who help the BCMA build their rockets. *Mr. Caton is a machinist in Mr. Ferro's team. He is the main builder of the BCMA's rockets. *Homer Hickam, Sr. is a hard-headed mine foreman in Coalwood and Sonny's father. He takes his job very seriously, going out of his way to help miners in distress. He is almost always at odds with the union leader, John Dubonnet, who dated Elsie when they were all in high school together. Homer Sr. seems to not care about Sonny's affairs as much as he does Jim's; Sonny points this out in the book much to Homer Sr.'s chagrin. He has a spot on his lung that is the common miner's disease, black lung (Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis), but refuses to quit work, although most men who are discovered to have this illness are forced into retirement, but allowed to stay in Coalwood. *Elsie Hickam is Sonny's mother. She is supportive of Sonny's rocket building, but often finds herself at odds with her husband, Homer Sr., about the rocket building. She often tells Sonny, \\"Don't blow yourself up.\\" She is consistently working on a mural of Myrtle Beach throughout the memoir. *Dorothy Plunk is Sonny's dream girl; he even describes her as \\"God's Perfection\\" at one point in the memoir. While Sonny spends most of his time infatuated with her, although she still spends time with him, Dorothy only wants a friend relationship and goes out with other boys. For a large section of the book, Sonny ignores her, because she started a relationship with his brother Jim. She was also the valedictorian of Sonny's graduating high school class and took Sonny's spot in a calculus class because her grades were higher. *Valentine Carmina is an older girl who likes Sonny. Ultimately, she taught him about having sex in the backseat of an old Dodge the same day Dorothy broke his heart. *Jim Hickam is Sonny's older brother who plays for the school's football team. He dates the girl Sonny is in love with, Dorothy Plunk, but later dumps her like he does with many of his girlfriends. *Mr. Isaac Bykovski is a worker in the mine who helps Sonny with his first rockets. Homer Sr. makes him work in the mine as punishment for helping Sonny. Later, Homer Sr. offers him his job back in the machine shop, but Bykovski does not accept the offer because he made more money in the mine. He is later killed in a mine collapse while operating a loader. *Geneva Eggers is a middle-aged woman who was rescued as a baby by Homer Hickam Sr. when her house was on fire. The rest of her family were still in the house when it went up in flames but she was the only one whom Homer Sr. saw. Everyone else in her family perished. It is implied that after the fire, she turned to prostitution in order to support herself. During the novel, she invites Sonny into her home when he almost freezes to death on a December night and gives him a new set of clothes.

There are approximately 680 university art museums and galleries in the United States. While historically the origins of these kinds of institutions can be traced back to learning collections in art academies in Western Europe, they are now most often housed in centers of higher education. The primary aim of many university art museums and galleries is to create a sphere removed from the pressures of the commercial art world where students, artists, curators, and faculty can experiment freely; in terms of both making and exhibiting art, and also curating. Distinctions between art museums, galleries, and academic museums An art museum houses a permanent collection, whereas a gallery usually hosts a changing program of art exhibitions. However, some university and college art galleries also feature permanent collections or showcase collections owned by the larger institution. Some institutions have a museum or an art gallery, and some have both. Others, such as the City College of New York, have important collections but neither a museum nor a dedicated gallery. Art schools in the United States often have many gallery spaces on campus. Maryland Institute College of Art has 21 galleries. Many university and college libraries also feature galleries to showcase items from their collections, which can include art, music, poetry, literary works and ephemera. Another important distinction is the difference between art museums and academic museums. All university art museums and galleries are types of academic museums, but not all academic museums are university art museums and galleries. Vulnerability in times of crisis University art museums function in a number of different ways. Some exist as affiliates of a university, operated by a separate board of trustees and administration, while others are nested within the institution. Art museum collections can become vulnerable to deaccession due to fiscal issues. One such example of a controversial deaccession was the Randolph College scandal; when the administration sold paintings from the museum's collection without the permission of the museum. Academic freedoms and artistic freedoms of expression University art museums and galleries differ from traditional art museums and commercial galleries due to their relationship with institutions of higher education where academic freedoms are ideally upheld. With the protection of academic freedoms, topics that would otherwise be avoided, ignored, or censored can be openly explored. The two main academic freedoms are: the freedom of the student to study whatever they want, and the freedom of the teacher to teach whatever they want.James Morgan Hart, German Universities: A Narrative of Personal Experiences (New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1874); quoted in Leo L. Rockwell, “Academic Freedom: German Origin and American Development,” Bulletin of the American Association of University Professors 36, 2 (Summer 1950): 225-236. When these two freedoms are observed, in the context of a university art museum and/or gallery, a unique setting for academic discovery is opened up. University art museums and exhibits are sometimes sources of controversies regarding issues of propriety, politics, gender, and sexuality.

Those who believe it to represent Gentile de' Becchi include E. H. and E. W. Blashfield in their annotations to Vasari's Lives of Seventy of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, VOL. II (1896) Charles Scribener and Son. and Hugh Ross-Williamson, Lorenzo the Magnificent, Michael Joseph, (p. 179) Gentile de' Becchi (1420/1430 – 1497) was an Italian bishop, diplomat, orator and writer. He was a member of the Platonic Academy of the Medici of Florence and tutor of Lorenzo the Magnificent and his son Giovanni de' Medici, later Pope Leo X. Of his writings there exist many letters, poems in Latin, and prayers which are praised by historian Cecil Grayson as his finest works. Early life and priesthood Gentile de' Becchi was born in Urbino, the son of Giorgio Becchi, member of a family traditionally linked to the powerful Florentine Medici dynasty. Both the year of his birth and the place of his early studies are unknown. As a priest, in 1450, with the support of the Medici, he was appointed to the parish of San Giovanni in Florence. He became a canon of Pisa Cathedral and in 1462 he became canonical prebend of Florence Cathedral, controlling the finances of the diocese for Archbishop Giovanni Neroni, and holding benefices in Decimo, Cascina and Fagna. In 1473, Lorenzo de' Medici, as '’de facto'’ ruler of Florence, proposed him as Bishop of Arezzo. According to historian Cecil Grayson, although de' Becchi's appointment as Bishop had been orchestrated by Lorenzo, both the Archbishop of Forence and Pope Sixtus IV held him in high esteem for his devotion to the faith, his knowledge, his abilities and his character.Cecil Grayson, Gentile de' Becchi, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani – Volume 7 (1970) Despite his close association with Florence and the Medici family, de' Becchi did not neglect his obligations to Arezzo. He supported the founding of a convent of Poor Clares in the city, licensed the Olivetans to build a church and monastery, and made improvements to the Bishop's palace. Humanist and teacher In 1454, Gentile was chosen by Piero di Cosimo de' Medici as tutor to his sons, the future Lorenzo the Magnificent and his brother Giuliano.Mediateca di Palazzo Medici Riccardi In 1466, he accompanied Lorenzo de' Medici on an ambassadorial mission to Pope Paul II. The following year, Gentile accompanied Lorenzo's mother, Lucrezia Tornabuoni, to Rome, to negotiate agreements with the powerful Orsini family in order to arrange betrothal of Clarice Orsini to Lorenzo. Gentile de' Becchi then returned to Rome in April 1469, to accompany Clarice to Florence for her marriage. Gentile became a prominent member of the Medici Academy, alongside the philosophers Marsilio Ficino, Cristoforo Landino and later, Agnolo Poliziano and Pico della Mirandola. He was known as a poet, as well as a theologian and orator, and communicated with other poets and humanists including Cardinal Jacopo Piccolomini-Ammannati, Francesco Filelfo, and Donato Acciaiuoli. Agnolo Poliziano dedicated his ode Del Lungo, written in the wake of the Pazzi conspiracy, to de' Becchi. In 1489, Lorenzo chose Gentile as tutor of his second son, Giovanni de' Medici, who had started on an ecclesiastical career in agreement with Pope Innocent VIII. While Lorenzo's wife Clarice Orsini, who did not share her husband's Platonic ideals, was happy to have the Bishop of Arezzo tutor her son, and wanted him to be given exercises out of the psalter, it caused conflict with Poliziano, of whom she was deeply suspicious.Pottinger, pp. 72–74 Giovanni was made a cardinal at thirteen and at thirty-eight succeeded Pope Julius II as Pope Leo X.Hugh Ross-Williamson, pp. 202 and 275Ilan Rachum, The Renaissance: an Illustrated Encyclopedia, Octopus (1979) Pazzi conspiracy In 1478, the Pazzi conspiracy, involving members of the Florentine Pazzi family, and sanctioned by Pope Sixtus IV (a member of the della Rovere family) resulted in an attack on Easter Sunday, which left Lorenzo de' Medici wounded and his brother, the popular Giuliano, dead. Violent reprisals broke out in Florence with members and associates of the Pazzi family killed, including the Archbishop of Pisa, Francesco Salviati, a relative of Pope Sixtus, who was condemned to death and hanged.Brucker, pp. 258–9 The Pope responded by arresting the Florentine ambassador, excommunicating Lorenzo de' Medici and the Signoria (Town Council) and forbidding the Florentine clergy from practising.Hugh Ross-Williamson, p. 177 Gentile de' Becchi, as Bishop of Arezzo, stood by the Medici, breaking the interdict launched by Pope Sixtus IV against the Florentine clergy. With the archbishop Rinaldo Orsini, he convened a synod of the local clergy and succeeded in returning the normal spiritual and ecclesiastical life to the City of Florence.Hugh Ross-Williamson, p. 178 At the synod, de' Becchi delivered a speech in which he refuted all the arguments put forward by the Pope for the sanctions, and accused the Pope Sixtus of being behind the attack, in order to bring Florence under his control. The speech was immediately printed by Niccolò della Magna and circulated. It is probable that for this reason Gentile de' Becchi's proposal as cardinal was rejected by the Pope. In 1481, Sixtus commissioned a team of painters including Florentines Botticelli and Domenico Ghirlandaio to take part in the painting of a series of narrative frescos in the Sistine Chapel. This was part of healing the breach between Florence and the Vatican.André Chastel, Art of the Italian Renaissance, Alpine Fine Arts, p. 86 Ambassador Gentile de' Becchi's oratorial skills made him the chosen representative of the Republic of Florence on a number of diplomatic missions, besides his role in making peace after the Pazzi conspiracy. He occupied this role both under Lorenzo and his son Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici who succeeded his father on his death in March 1492. In 1483 Gentile went to France to bear greetings to Charles VIII after his coronation. In 1485 he went on behalf of Florence to negotiate with Pope Innocent VIII over hostilities with Ferdinand II of Aragon. In 1492 he was sent by Piero to bear greetings to the newly elected Pope Alexander VI. In 1493 and 1494 he was in France with Piero Soderini negotiating peace between Florence and Charles VIII who was planning to invade Italy. Imprudent actions by Piero, who was known as \\"Piero the Unfortunate\\", towards the French king angered the Florentines and on 9 November 1494 Piero was forced to flee to the safety of Bologna, leaving the Medici Palace to be ransacked by an angry mob.Hugh Ross Williamson, pp. 270–74 Death Gentile did not return to Florence after the exile of the Medici. He lived until his death at Villa alle Botte, and died, in 1497, in Arezzo, where his body was buried in Arezzo Cathedral.

Berkus (born March 23, 1941) is an American angel investor and venture capitalist from California. He is credited with technological innovations in computer software for the hotel and lodging industries and was recognized by that industry's Hospitality Financial Technology Professionals association with its International Hall of Fame designation. In perhaps the first use of the term, Inc. Magazine described him as a \\"super angel\\" in 1996. He attended Occidental College in Eagle Rock, California, graduating in 1962. He then served in the United States Naval Reserve for nearly a decade while simultaneously managing his first enterprise, a phonograph record production and manufacturing company, which he created at the age of 15. He is responsible for leading companies as CEO, chairman or lead director. He was awarded \\"Director of the Year\\" for his board leadership efforts with over 40 companies over the years. He has formed, managed and sold businesses in the hospitality, entertainment and software industries. He specifically deals with business operations and venture investing and serves on a number of corporate boards, (see below).  Early years  In 1957, when he was 15, Berkus founded his first company, Custom Fidelity, Inc., whose purpose was to produce and manufacture phonograph records. In 1971 he managed this company to its initial public offering (IPO) under SEC Regulation \\"A,\\" which pertains to small businesses. In 1968 he relocated the company from Pasadena to Hollywood. By 1974, the company employed over fifty people under its record manufacturing operation and other related divisions, and he sold his interest in the business. During his time at Occidental College, Berkus held the position of editor for the Occidental Weekly, as well as president of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. In his senior year he received the Wall Street Journal Award for his accomplishments in the study of economics. In 1962, he graduated from Occidental College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration. Berkus then served in the United States Naval Reserve from 1963-1967, serving as an aircrewman aboard P2 aircraft. He reached the level of E5, and then was awarded a direct commission in the United States Naval Reserve as an Air Intelligence Officer from 1967-1972, reaching the level of O3, while still managing Custom Fidelity Inc. Having programmed an early minicomputer for the record company in his spare time, he found a market for the programs by creating the earliest forms of packaged software. He sold his interest in the record company, and founded Berkus Compusystems Inc., in 1974 to market the computer software he had written. One of the several hundred early customers was a local hotel, the Miramar Sheraton, whose owner asked him to write software for reservations and front office operations. From that request, Berkus turned his attention to the hotel industry that had little previous automation in its past, and formed Computerized Lodging Systems Inc., in 1981. Through his work in these two companies, he helped to shape the minicomputer software industry, being recognized by the Inc. 500 list of America’s fasting- growing companies in 1987 and 1988. His company held 16% of the world market share for hotel automation systems. He sold Computerized Lodging Systems to MAI Systems, Inc. in 1990 and continued to operate the company as a subsidiary until 1993, when he left to form Berkus Technology Ventures. (See below.) His achievements were recognized by his induction into the highly exclusive (42 members as of 2018) Hospitality (HFTP) “International Hall of Fame” in 1998. As of 2018, Marriott Hotels still used the computer software he wrote in 2,200 hotels under the internal name, FOSSE. He is related to designer and TV personality, Nate Berkus, architect Barry Berkus (deceased), Josh Berkus Software in the Public Interest, casino manager/author Eric David Berkus, and western states lawyer Matt Berkus. Venture capital and corporate development While Berkus often serves as chief financial officer of several of his early stage companies, his primary focus has been as a managing partner or managing director of six early stage investment funds, including Kodiak Ventures, LP, Berkus Technology Ventures, LLC., three funds managed for the Tech Coast Angels of Southern California, and Wayfare Ventures, LLC. Berkus is current or recent Board Chairman or board member for numerous public and private technology companies (see below), and has been active in a total of over forty private and public companies. He has made 182 investments in early stage ventures, often known as angel investing, for which he has an IRR of 105%, which includes capital contributions to his various funds (see above). He is also Chairman Emeritus of the Tech Coast Angels, one of the largest angel investor networks in the United States. Philanthropy Berkus is a longtime trustee of Occidental College and was a driving force in developing its newest and largest dormitory, a 274-bed hall which was originally named Rangeview Hall. In 2013 the dormitory was renamed Berkus Hall in recognition of a $5 million gift from Berkus and his wife and children. A second residence for senior women at Occidental College was named Berkus House in honor of a previous donation to the College.  Affiliations  In recognition for adding significant shareholder value for emerging technology companies over the past decade, he was named “Director of the Year-Early Stage Businesses” by the Forum for Corporate Directors of Orange County, California, and Technology Leader of the Year by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. = Current boards of directors = *AuriQ Systems, Inc. *EPC International, Inc.

History of discovery  Excavation of the fossils Mid caudal vertebrae In 2010 and 2012, at Picún Leufu in Neuquén Province, remains were uncovered of several types of sauropods. One of these was a diplodocoid new to science. In 2014, the type species Leinkupal laticauda was named and described by Pablo Gallina, Sebastián Apesteguía, Alejandro Haluza and Juan Canale. The generic name combines the Mapudungun lein, \\"vanishing\\", and kupal, \\"family\\", in reference to Leinkupal being the last, or youngest, known species of the Diplodocidae. The specific name is derived from Latin, latus, \\"wide\\", and cauda, \\"tail\\", in reference to the broad caudal vertebrae. The holotype, MMCH-Pv 63-1, was found in a layer of the Bajada Colorado Formation dating from the Berriasian–Valanginian. It consists of a front tail vertebra. As paratypes were assigned: MMCH-Pv 63-2/3: two front tail vertebrae; MMCH-Pv 63-4: a hind tail vertebra, MMCH-Pv 63-5: a front dorsal vertebra, MMCH-Pv 63-6: a front tail vertebra; and MMCH-Pv 63-7/8: two vertebrae of the middle tail. Additional possible material has been discovered but was not referred as its identity was uncertain. Leinkupal was a relatively small sauropod, with an estimated body length of nine metres. Several unique derived traits, or autapomorphies, could be established. The front tail vertebrae have extremely well-developed transverse processes, as long as the width of the vertebral body, expanded sideways and to below, and possessing robust reinforcing ridges on their top and bottom surfaces. The front tail vertebrae have very robust ridges running between the vertebral body and the front joint processes, the prezygapophyses. The front tail vertebrae have rear joint processes, postzygapophyses, with two paired pneumatic openings at their inner bases, opposite from the joint facets. Classification Anterior caudal vertebrae Leinkupal was placed in the Diplodocinae within the Diplodocidae. A cladistic analysis indicated it was a possible sister species of Tornieria, discovered in Africa. As the latter genus lived much earlier, during the Late Jurassic, this would imply that the Diplodocoidea had an early origin, no later than the Middle Jurassic. The affinity between Leinkupal and Tornieria could be explained by either an early radiation of diplodocines or a later colonising of South-America from Africa. Leinkupal is the only known unequivocal diplodocid from South-America and the youngest unequivocal diplodocid globally, the only known from the Cretaceous. Cladogram of the Diplodocidae after Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015). Palaeoenvironment Leinkupal was discovered in the Bajada Colorada Formation. This formation is composed of red and greenish brown sandstones and conglomerates of fine to coarse grain, in addition to prominent bands of tan siltstones and reddish claystones. These deposits represent a fluvial environment with braided rivers. Paleosols and channels with cross- stratification are present. Leinkupal shared its habitat with several theropods including basal tetanurans, possible deinonychosaurians, and possible abelisauroids, in addition to the dicraeosaurid sauropod Bajadasaurus.

Background Brothers Robert and Leonard Brown ran an oil drilling business together until they had a falling out, which resulted in Robert buying out Leonard's share of the business. Part of the sale agreement was that Leonard agreed to a restraint of trade, that meant he could not compete as a well driller anywhere in New Zealand, for the next 20 years. That was in 1968. Years later, Leonard decided to reenter the well drilling business with his sons. Robert tried to enforce the 20 years restraint of trade clause. Decision The Court of Appeal ruled that the restraint of trade was unreasonable in both the area and the time period, as Robert was unable to provide any evidence to support the need for these to protect his business. Accordingly, the court modified the restraint of trade by reducing the area to the northern part of the North Island, as well as reducing the length to 12 years.

It tells of a young man who goes to seek revenge for his father's murder, before ultimately forgiving the killer. A film version was produced in 1928 by Tan Boen Soan. Plot After his father is murdered, Tan Hian Beng is forced to leave for Batavia. When he is an adult, he is given a blood-covered handkerchief and told that he must take revenge on his father's killer. He leaves for Semarang, and along the way rescues sisters Lim Kiat Nio and Lim Liang Tin from a group of bandits under the command of Li Djin Hin. Once in Semarang, Tan becomes assistant to the letnan Cina Goei Tjeng Tin. Through his relationship with Goei, Tan is reunited with his mother and learns of a young man named Kam Po Sin, who has killed a woman. In an attempt to stop the investigation, Kam Po Sin joins forces with Li; the two kidnap Lim Kiat Nio and capture Tan and Goei, but try to kill each other after Kiat Nio escapes. Kam Po Sin emerges victorious, but is caught and sentenced to death. On the day of the execution, Tan passes by Kam Po Sin's house. Hearing the sound of weeping, he investigates, and finds Kam Po's father Tiok Tjoen, who killed Tan's father. Kam Tiok Tjoen is shocked at Tan's appearance, believing him to be the ghost of the murdered man. Tan, for his part, decides that Kam Tiok Tjoen need not be killed, for he has already suffered enough. Writing and publication Setangan Berloemoer Darah was written by Tjoe Hong Bok. In his preface to the novel, Tjoe wrote that it was based on a series of letters he had been given which detailed true events in the 18th and 19th centuries; according to Tjoe, he merely changed the names of the individuals involved and the location where the events took place. As such, the critic of Chinese Malay literature Nio Joe Lan classifies Setangan Berloemoer Darah as a historical novel. Chris Woodrich of Gadjah Mada University questions this, however, noting that it was common for Chinese Malay novels to claim to be based on a true story despite being entirely fictitious. The novel was published in Semarang, Dutch East Indies, in 1927. By 1930, copies were being sold in Singapore, part of the Straits Settlements. Film A film adaptation of the novel was produced by Tan Boen Soan, a journalist who had worked for several newspapers in Batavia; this was the second domestic adaptation of a novel, following G. Krugers' Eulis Atjih in 1927. Little is recorded of this production, including the cast and box- office returns. It is known, however, to have been a silent film in black-and- white. The film (as with most productions in the Dutch East Indies) is thought to be lost. As with the earlier film Lily van Java (1928), the film version of Setangan Berloemoer Darah was directed at ethnic Chinese audiences, and like the earlier work it was produced by ethnic Chinese businessmen who were capitalising on the success of films produced in Shanghai, China. Beginning in 1929, with the release of Rampok Preanger and Si Tjonat, the use of martial arts became common in domestic productions through a series of bandit films.

The Institute mostly investigated questions of nutrition. This was an important consideration in wartime Britain, where food was in short supply. The experiments into deficiency of vitamin A and vitamin C were particularly notable. However, other kinds of medical research was also undertaken, such as research into the transmission of scabies. The leading figures in the institute were Kenneth Mellanby and Hans Adolf Krebs. The volunteers were mainly conscientious objectors to military service. Some of the experiments were unpleasant, or even dangerous. The Institute closed in 1946, soon after the end of the war. History Early in 1941 twelve volunteers, pacifist conscientious objectors, recruited via the Sheffield Pacifist Service Unit, were established in a large house\\"Fairholme\\", 18 Oakholme Drive, Broomhill, Sheffield in a residential area of Sheffield for research that would \\"benefit humanity\\". Various medical experiments were conducted on the volunteers. No work that had a direct military application was undertaken since this would not have been acceptable to many conscientious objectors. This establishment became known as the Sorby Research Institute, so named because the leading researcher, Kenneth Mellanby, was a Sorby Research Fellow of the Royal Society at Sheffield University. The fellowship is itself named after Henry Clifton Sorby, a notable Sheffield scientist. Hans Adolf Krebs took over the management of the volunteers in 1943 when Mellanby left to work for the army. The establishment was founded on the personal initiative of Mellanby and at first he was free to carry out whatever investigations he chose. Mellanby's status as a scientist meant that he was in a reserved occupation and forbidden from joining the armed forces. Although he wished to do something for the war effort, the military of the time had no use for biologists. Consequently, Mellanby initiated what he considered useful work himself.Dixon, p. 208 The first experiment was an investigation into scabies. Mellanby had an interest in head lice infestation and scabies was thus a natural area of research for him. Another early experiment looked into water deprivation of survivors in lifeboats. However, the most important work of the Institute was into nutrition, particularly vitamin deficiency. In a period of severe rationing in Britain, it was important for the government to know how far this could be taken and what the consequences would be. This work was commissioned by the Medical Research Council at the request of the Ministry of Health. The work of the Sorby Research Institute continued until early 1946.Sorby Collection The building is now used as residential accommodation for students from Sheffield University.Collins, p. 559  Volunteers  There were initially 12 volunteers at the house. This eventually grew to 35, including three women. Walter Bartley acted as technician and assistant to Mellanby and later became a professor at Sheffield University, but he also served as a volunteer experiment subject. All the volunteers were young; the 19 men and one woman in the vitamin C experiment were aged between 17 and 34. Some volunteers had regular jobs outside the programme, the rest were expected to carry out domestic tasks in the house. They were also given duties to perform for the experimenters such as collecting data. Mellanby chose to use conscientious objectors because they were the only group of healthy young people who were not likely to be taken away from him for some military purpose in the middle of an experiment. For their part, the conscientious objectors wished to take part so that they could do something with an equivalent risk to military service.Melicharova, pp. 7-8 It is unlikely that many of these experiments would be allowed to be repeated under modern ethical guidelines. Some were dangerous for the volunteers. However, according to John Pemberton, who worked at the Institute, nobody was permanently harmed in any experiment. In 2006 Pemberton attempted to trace the surviving volunteers to solicit their views on the work. Only four still living could be found and all said they thought the work was \\"worthwhile\\" and that they would have \\"volunteered again\\" if asked.Pemberton, p. 556  Research  =Vitamin deficiency= A few experiments performed on vitamin deficiency, such as one conducted to determine the effects of Vitamin A deficiency and to optimize its treatment. In that study, 23 men and women volunteered to live on a diet deficient in vitamin A. However, this experiment lasted considerably longer than expected, from July 1942 to October 1944, and the only specific effect that developed in those deprived of vitamin A was some loss of night vision after about eight months.Pemberton, p. 557 A similar experiment was conducted on vitamin C. It lasted from October 1944 to February 1946. Wounds were created on the subjects to study the influence of the vitamin. Ten of the twenty subjects were completely restricted from vitamin C. The wounds of those subjects became hemorrhagic, but the study found that a daily dose of ten milligrams was sufficient to prevent or reverse scurvy in several cases.Glasgow Herald The vitamin C research led to the issue of free orange juice for children. The Medical Research Council established recommended daily intakes of vitamins A and C on the basis of the institute's research.Pemberton, p. 558 =Scabies= Scabies is a skin disease caused by the burrowing of the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. It leads to what sufferers have described as an \\"almost intolerable\\" itching. The experiment was carried out in 1941 and its purpose was to investigate the mode of transmission and possible treatments. The researchers had some difficulty in reliably causing an infection in the volunteers. One technique that was found to be effective was to require the volunteer to wear the used, unwashed underwear of a scabies victim. Mellanby subsequently used the results of this research in the treatment and observation of military personnel, amongst whom the disease was rifeMellanby, p. 81 and for which there was previously no effective treatment. He set up a military hospital for this purpose and sent army medical officers to the institute for training. = Water deprivation = The purpose of this experiment, conducted in 1942, was to investigate the minimum requirement for water. Large amounts of shipping were being sunk in the Battle of the Atlantic by German forces and many surviving sailors spent long periods in lifeboats before being rescued. For this reason, it was known as the shipwreck experiment. A key question was how long they could be expected to survive on only the rations available in lifeboats. The volunteers in this study were deprived of fluids for three and a half days and only allowed to eat the kind of dried food stored as emergency supplies in lifeboats such as sea biscuits and chocolate. Of all the experiments conducted at the institute, the water deprivation experiment was the one most disliked by the volunteers. = Wheat extraction = Wheat extraction rate is the amount of grist that becomes flour in a flour mill (the milling yield). A high extraction rate results in brown flour and brown bread. 100% extraction is called wholemeal flour, 70% extraction results in white bread and flour. This was an issue for wartime Britain because wheat imports were essential to her survival and the higher the extraction rate, the less grain would need to be imported. Less grain meant that fewer ships would be needed to transport it, and ships were being sunk at a prodigious rate by German U-boats.Edgerton, p. 179 The institute was charged in 1942 with looking into the nutritional value of high extraction wheat. As a result of this research a \\"national wheatmeal loaf\\" of 85% extraction was introduced. It was priced the same as the staple white bread to encourage the public to use it (in this period brown bread was normally considered a speciality bread and was more expensive). The research was particularly looking at the issues of digestibility and calcium absorption. There was some objection from nutritionists to this change. It was known that a high extraction, high fibre, diet leads to poor uptake of vitamin D, and hence can lead to rickets.Marx et al., p.267 However, the cost in ships and lives was of greater importance during the war than dietary considerations, so long as the effects were not immediately debilitating. The results of the wheat extraction research made a large difference to Britain's war effort. It has been calculated that raising the extraction rate from 75% to 85% saved the equivalent of forty Liberty ships. = Other experiments = One experiment required that blood circulation to limbs was cut off with elastic bands.Collins, p. 558 Others included infection with malaria and investigations into surgical shock.

It was a two-seater that featured a body made of laminated wood. The motor, supplied by Wolsely, was mounted longitudinally behind the front seats. Two chains took the drive to the solid rear axle and differential action occurred within the rear wheel hubs. This increased ground clearance and minimized power loss compared to more orthodox driveline configurations. It was exhibited at Australia House in London for some months before Marks and Moir bought the prototype and some components to Australia.

The British attacked in 1720 as they built Fort William Augustus at Canso.  Established  The village of Guysborough was first settled by Europeans in 1634 by Isaac de Razilly. He built a fort named Fort St François à Canso at the entrance to the harbour. In 1655 Nicolas Denys, governor of the new St Lawrence Bay Province, built Fort Chedabuctou on Fort Point to serve as his capital. The fort was later replaced and renamed Fort St Louis. In 1682, a permanent settlement was started by Clerbaud Bergier. A group cleared land and spent the winter with the first crops being planted in 1683. Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Meneval landed at Chedabouctou in 1687 when arriving to take up his position as governor of Acadia. Claude Bergier led other merchants from La Rochelle, France in enjoying a fishing monopoly in Acadia. In 1682, Fort St. Louis was established by the Company of Acadia (Compagnie de la Peche Sedentaire) to protect the fishery. The principal ports were at Chedabucto Bay, which accounted for fifty fishers in 1686. Dauphin de Montorgueil was the commandant at Fort Saint- Louis. Just before the outbreak of King William's War, Gabriel Gautier erected a small fort and fishing establishment (1686). It had two buildings, 60 X 20 feet each, defended by four cannon. There were 150 residents, of whom 80 were fishermen. A detachment of regular troops was eventually stationed at the fort.Blue Pete  Raid on Chedabucto (1688)  In 1687 there were 150 persons at Chedabouctou, 80 of whom were fishermen. The Company of Acadia suffered heavy losses in 1688, when Chedabouctou was pillaged by New Englanders.  Battle at Chedabucto (1690)  During King William's War, in 1690, Captain Cyprian Southack proceeded to Chedabucto to take Fort St. Louis which, unlike Port Royal, Nova Scotia, put up a fight before surrendering. As part of Sir William Phips expedition to destroy the capital of Acadia Port Royal, Phips sent Southack to Chedabacto with 80 men to destroy Fort St. Louis and the surrounding French fishery. Meneval was stationed at the fort with 12 soldiers. They tried to defend the fort for over six hours, until fire bombs burned the fort to the ground. Southack destroyed the enormous amount of 50, 000 crowns of fish.Emiley Griffith, p. 153 At the same time, Phips also dispatched Capt. John Alden who raid Cape Sable Island as well as the villages around the Bay of Fundy, particularly Grand Pre and Chignecto. The Company of Acadia encountered a variety of difficulties on the way to its final disappearance in 1702.  Raid on Chedabucto (1718) - The Squirrel Affair  Shortly after Southack established himself at Shelburne, Nova Scotia, the Mi'kmaq raided the station and burned it to the ground.Geoffery Plank. An Unsettled Conquest. University of Pennsylvania. 2001. p. 76-77. In response, from 17–24 September 1718, Captain Cyprian Southack and Captain Thomas Smart led a raid on Canso.CO 217, vol. 2, part 2. During the eighteenth century, Canso was not on Nova Scotia's mainland, but instead referred to the settlements on modern-day Grassy Island. On 18 September 1718, Smart seized a French brigantine and sloop, along with smaller vessels, as well as each ships' cargo. He next apprehended the French fishers' cod before destroying their flakes and houses. When Smart and Southack returned to Boston, they both encouraged Governor of Nova Scotia Richard Philipps to fortify Canso.According to amateur historian Haynes, Southack laid siege for three days to Fort St. Louis at Chedabucto, which was defended primarily by Acadians (Haynes, p. 121, 125). There were approximately 300 Acadians in the area (Haynes, p.122). On board HMS Squirrel, Southack killed numerous of the Acadians and imprisoned others. On September 18, British marines landed on Lasconde's Grave and seized the entrance to Chedabuctou Harbour. The following day HMS Squirrel landed troops at Salmon River who then proceeded to the rear of the village. HMS Squirrel made its first attempt to enter the harbour but was beaten back by the Acadian cannon fire from the Fort. Later in the day the village was captured by the land troops. On September 20 HMS Squirrel made a second attempt to enter the harbour. It successfully fired upon the fort. On September 23 Southack burned the village and loaded the goods on to the captured French transports. After pillaging and burning the villages, on September 24, Southack released the Acadian prisoners onto the Canso Islands without any provisions or clothing (Campbell, p. 132).

The Florida State Attorney's Office determined that it was not suitable for prosecution, finding that Griffin was falsely identified (the victim described the man who shot him as being \\"around 6-foot to 6-2\\"; Griffin is 6-9) while determining that Griffin had an alibi (his alarm system was on the night of the shooting until the following morning, and a motion detector picked him up as movement in a hallway).

Early life Dürrünev Kadın was born on 15 March 1835 in Batumi, Georgia. Born as Melek Dziapş-lpa, she was a member of the Abkhazian Dziapş-lpa family. Her father was Prince Mahmud Bey Dziapş-lpa, and her mother was Princess Halime Hanım Çikotua, an Abkhazian. She had two younger sisters, Princess Ayşe Kemalifer Hanım (1838 – 1901), and Princess Aliye Hanım. She was also the maternal aunt of Nazperver Kadın, fourth wife of Sultan Mehmed V. She had been brought to Istanbul as a young child, where her father entrusted her to the imperial harem together with her sister Ayşe. The two of them were then placed in the service of Sultan Abdulmejid I's first wife Servetseza Kadın, where her name according to the custom of the Ottoman court was changed to Dürrünev. Dürrünev had an avocation for painting and playing piano. She had also learned French. Marriage One day, when Abdulaziz was in his twenties, he visited his sister-in-law Servetseza Kadın. Here he saw Dürrünev, then twenty one years old, and fell in love with her. He asked his sister-in-law to give him Dürrünev in marriage, but she flatly refused. However, after the prince's pleading to Servetseza, she acceded to her brother-in-law's demand. The marriage took place on 20 May 1856 in the Dolmabahçe Palace. Dürrünev gave birth to the couple's first child, a son, Şehzade Yusuf Izzeddin on 29 September 1857. After Abdulaziz's accession to the throne on 25 June 1861, Dürrünev was installed the principal consort with the title of \\"Senior Consort\\". On 11 July 1862, she gave birth to her second child, a daughter, Saliha Sultan. Four years later, on 28 September 1866, she gave birth to her third child, a son, Şehzade Mehmed Selim, who died at the age of one on 23 October 1867. In October 1868, Dürrünev met with Empress Eugénie de Montijo of France, when the latter paid a visit to Istanbul. In 1869, she met with the Princess of Wales Alexandra of Denmark, when the latter visited Istanbul with her husband Prince of Wales Edward (future Edward VII). Abdulaziz was deposed by his ministers on 30 May 1876, his nephew Murad V became the Sultan. He was transferred to Feriye Palace the next day. Dürrünev, and other women of Abdulaziz's entourage didn't wanted to leave the Dolmabahçe Palace. So they were grabbed by hand and were send out to the Feriye Palace. In the process, they were searched from head to toe and everything of value was taken from them. On 4 June 1876, Abdulaziz died under mysterious circumstances. Death Dürrünev Kadın died on 7 December 1895 at the Feriye Palace, and was buried in the mausoleum of Sultan Mahmud II, located at Divan Yolu street, Istanbul.

Biography  Born in Moscow on January 2, 1928 in the family of doctors Yakov Rakhmilovich Rabin (originally from Ukraine) and Veronika Martynovna Anderman (from Latvia). In 1946-1948 he studied at the Art Academy of Latvia in Riga. In 1948-1949 he studied at the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow. Oscar Rabin was one of the originators of the nonconformism era and a key organizer of what is now referred to as the 'Lianozovo Group', a collective which grew around (1893-1979). Over a period of seven years (1958-1965), the former camp barracks in Lianozovo, where Oskar Rabin lived with his wife, Valentina Kropivnitskaya, acted as the center of the progressive intelligentsia. Soviet material life and its dramatic absurdity was for many years the central theme of Rabin’s creativity. The artist’s favorite genres included landscape, still life and interiors, continuing in the tradition of 1920s European expressionism. Rabin uses a distortion of perspective, the principles of deformation and the destruction of large-scale relationships. Along with the writer and collector Alexander Glezer, Oscar Rabin was instrumental in the organization of what is known as the dissident Bulldozer Exhibition, an unofficial art exhibition on a vacant lot in the Belyayevo (ru) urban forest by Moscow avant-garde artists on 15 September 1974. The exhibition was forcefully broken up by a large police force that included bulldozers and water cannons. These events and Rabin's biography have been documented in the two-part documentary Oscar (2018) and In Search of a Lost Paradise (2015). Subsequently, he participated in the jubilee exhibition on Gogol Boulevard in 1995, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the exhibition of painting in the pavilion \\"beekeeping\\" at VDNH with Eduard Drobitsky, Julia Dolgorukova and other nonconformist artistsК 20-летию выставки в павильоне «Пчеловодство» ВДНХ СССР. Каталог. М., IFA, 1995.. In 1978, Rabin and his family were reportedly stripped of their Soviet passports and citizenship; that year, Rabin emigrated to Paris where he lived until his death at the age of 90 on 7 November 2018. In November 2016, via a signed Order of the President of the Russian Federation, Oscar Rabin - now long a citizen of France - was granted dual Russian citizenship. The artist had been predeceased by his wife - Valentina Kropivnitskaya (1924-2008) and their son, Alexandre Rabine (1952-1994), both noted artists as well. The Catalogue Raisonne of all oil paintings produced by Rabine during his lifetime is being prepared by the London based academic Dr Robert Rabilizirov, who has been working on this project for over 20 years.

The term \\"Pancasila economy\\" first appeared in an article by Emil Salim in 1967. is one of the staunchest of the Pancasila economic theorists. In essence, a Pancasila economy is a system that tries to avoid pendulum-like swings from one extreme (a free market economy, known in Indonesia as free fight liberalism) to the other (state socialism, especially of the Soviet kind). In simple terms, a \\"Pancasila economy\\" can be described as a market economic system with government control or a controlled market economy. A Pancasila economy can be considered an example of a mixed economy or a third way economic system. A Pancasila economy is seen as a counterbalance to a neoclassical approach promoting individualism and free markets that is adapted the values of Indonesian society, including religious values, culture, customs and norms. The concept of Pancasila economics was first conceived in the early days of the New Order as part of the regime's De-Sukarnoization and \\"cleansing of Communist, 30 September Movement and PKI remnants from Pancasila\\" which was aimed for what the regime claim as a \\"return into a pure, consequential Pancasila\\".  Characteristics  The Pancasila economic system is based on Article 33 of the Indonesian constitution. The article calls for \\"collective enterprises under the principle of 'familyism' ()\\", which is meant to be implemented through cooperatives, the state control of the commanding heights of the economy and of land and resources. The five basic characteristics of the economic concept of Pancasila are: * Cooperative development * Commitment to equity * Nationalist economic policy * Centralized planning * Decentralized implementation The Pancasila economic system is claimed to have superiority above liberalism. Theorists claim it as \\"an economic system for the common people\\". Pancasila economic theorists also argue the system's superiority over socialism, which they claim do not recognize \\"individual ownership\\" (; the term \\"pribadi\\" is an Indonesian homonym for both \\"private\\" and \\"personal\\").  Indonesia  There has been much discussion about the need for a Pancasila economic system in economic development policy in Indonesia since Indonesian independence in 1945. The principles of a Pancasila economy were mandated by the Indonesian Constitution in 1945. These include humanitarianism, economic nationalism, economic democracy and justice.

It has the formula Zn3(AsO4)2·8H2O and it is a dimorph of metaköttigite, which means that the two minerals have the same formula, but a different structure: köttigite is monoclinic and metaköttigite is triclinic.Journal of the Russell Society (2006) 9:3 There are several minerals with similar formulae but with other cations in place of the zinc. Iron forms parasymplesite Fe2+3(AsO4)2·8H2O; cobalt forms the distinctively coloured pinkish purple mineral erythrite Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O and nickel forms annabergite Ni3(AsO4)2·8H2O. Köttigite forms series with all three of these minerals and they are all members of the vivianite group. The Vivianite Group is a group of monoclinic phosphates and arsenates with divalent cations. The group members are annabergite, arupite, babanekite, baricite, erythrite, hornesite, kottingite, manganhornesite, pakhomovskyite, parasymplesite and vivianite.  Structure  Köttigite belongs to the monoclinic crystal system, so it has two crystal axes, a and c, inclined to each other at angle β, and a third axis, the b axis, at right angles to both a and c. It belongs to point group 2/m, which means that it has a two-fold axis of rotational symmetry parallel to b, and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. The space group is C2/m, which means that the unit cell is centred on the C face. Although zinc is the only transition metal that appears in the formula, köttigite usually contains significant quantities of cobalt and nickel, and these three elements are randomly distributed over the cation sites to form complex slabs perpendicular to the b axis. These sheets are held together by hydrogen bonding alone, which is quite weak, hence the perfect cleavage in this direction. There are two formula units per unit cell (Z = 2) and the cell parameters are a = 10.24 Å, b = 13.405 Å, c = 4.757 Å and β = 105.21°.  Appearance  Pure end-member köttigite is colourless, but frequently samples are coloured pink, red, red-orange or brown by elements substituting for the zinc. It is light rose-pink in transmitted light, translucent with a reddish-white to white streak and a resinous or waxy lustre, silky on fractures. Crystals are small, prismatic parallel to the c axis and flattened perpendicular to the b axis. It also occurs as massive crusts with a crystalline surface and fibrous structure.  Optical properties  The mineral is biaxial (+) with refractive indices nα = 1.622, nβ = 1.638 and nγ = 1.671. The maximum birefringence δ is the difference between the largest and the smallest refractive index, and is equal to 0.049. Biaxial crystals have two optic axes, and the angle between them is known as the optic angle, 2V. For köttigite 2V has a measured value of 74°, and a calculated value of 72°. Biaxial crystals have three mutually perpendicular principal optical direction, named X, Y and Z. Light travels at different speeds in different directions through the crystal. X is the direction of travel at the highest speed, Z at the lowest, and Y intermediate. The orientation is given by expressing the relationship of X, Y and Z to the crystallographic axes a, b and c. In monoclinic crystals one of the principal optical directions X, Y and Z coincides with the b axis. Since X, Y and Z are mutually perpendicular, it suffices to define just two of them, then the third is determined.Klein and Hurlbut (1993)Manual of Mineralogy. Wiley For köttigite X=b and Z^c=37°. Pleochroism is visible, with the crystal appearing colourless when viewed along X or Y, and pale red when viewed along Z. Pleochroism should not be present if the mineral is colourless. It is not fluorescent.  Physical properties  Köttigite is soft, with Mohs hardness only to 3, even softer than calcite, which has a hardness of 3. It is also fairly light, with specific gravity 3.33. Because of its sheetlike structure it has perfect cleavage perpendicular to the b axis; it is flexible, and has a fibrous fracture giving it a silky lustre on cleavage surfaces. It is soluble in acids.  Occurrence and associations  It is formed by the alteration of smaltite (Co,Fe,Ni)As2 and sphalerite ZnS. in oxidized zones of arsenical ores containing zinc. The type locality is the Daniel Mine (St. Daniel Mine), Neustädtel, Schneeberg District, Erzgebirge, Saxony, Germany, where it occurs in oxidized veins in a hydrothermal sulfide ore deposit, associated with roselite Ca2(Co2+,Mg)(AsO4)2·2H2O. At the Ojuela Mine, Mapimí Municipality, Mexico, it occurs in sprays of bladed crystals to 6 mm, which is large for the species, associated with symplesite Fe2+3(AsO4)2·8H2O, parasymplesite Fe2+3(AsO4)2·8H2O, adamite Zn2(AsO4)(OH), legrandite Zn2(AsO4)(OH)·H2O, metaköttigite Zn3(AsO4)2·8H2O and gypsum Ca(SO4)·2H2O. At the Hilton Mine, Cumbria, England, köttigite has been found in a specimen of galena PbS and gersdorffite NiAsS (but no sphalerite), on a surface coated with annabergite Ni3(AsO4)2·8H2O and an earthy crust. The individual crystals are colourless, transparent, and very small, the largest being about 1 mm. At Bou Azzer, Taznakht, Morocco, köttigite has been identified in a sample of vein quartz SiO2 rich in chalcopyrite CuFeS2 and sphalerite ZnS. The sample has turquoise- blue secondary minerals including devilline CaCu4(SO4)2(OH)6·3H2O, and also lath-shaped, blue-grey to pinkish grey crystals of köttigite with a habit resembling erythrite Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O, measuring less than 2 mm. The crystals are relatively rich in iron and cobalt, with traces of copper and nickel.Favreau et al (2007) The Mineralogical Record 38-5:381  References  Category:Zinc minerals Category:Arsenate minerals Category:Monoclinic minerals ","title":"Köttigite"},{"id":"42761899","text":"Dr. Alex Blake ( Miller) is a fictional character on the CBS crime drama Criminal Minds, portrayed by Jeanne Tripplehorn. Blake first appeared in \\"The Silencer\\" - episode one of season eight, replacing Agent Emily Prentiss who had resigned to go and run Interpol in \\"Run (Part II)\\". On May 14, 2014, it was revealed in the season 9 finale that Blake would be leaving the show. Tripplehorn's final episode as a main cast member on the show was on the May 14, 2014, episode \\"Demons\\". Background Blake's appointment at the BAU was met with some mixed reactions as the team was close to Prentiss. Blake joined the BAU to restore her reputation after Blake was blamed for arresting the wrong suspect in the Amerithrax case and Section Chief Erin Strauss let her take the fall. As a result, she and Strauss do not get along, with Strauss accusing her of joining for selfish reasons, but they eventually make amends. The rest of the team recognize her expertise and are generally less antagonistic towards her. Blake graduated from Berkeley with a double major and also holds a PhD. She was recruited to the FBI at the age of 24, making her one of at least two team members to join the Bureau in their early 20s along with Spencer Reid. Blake is also a professor of forensic linguistics at Georgetown, where Reid had previously guest lectured, and an SSA in the Washington field office. During her initial time at the FBI, Blake was involved in some high-profile cases, particularly the Unabomber case. Blake understands American Sign Language. In the season nine episode \\"Bully\\", it is revealed that Blake is estranged from her father Damon (a retired police captain of the Kansas City Police Department) and younger brother Scott (a current homicide detective there himself); after the death of her older brother Danny (a cop killed in the line of duty) and her mother, she found it too painful to be near her father and brother, and distanced herself from them. However, after Scott is injured by the unsub, the two siblings start to reconnect, and by the end of the episode, she reconciles with both Scott and Damon when she and the rest of the BAU team have a barbecue at her father's home. Season eight In \\"The Silencer\\", Blake resumes work with the BAU, specifically the team headed by Hotch and Rossi, helping them investigate a serial killer in Seattle, Washington, who was using his son to lure in his victims and, according to her, \\"made Ridgway look like a saint\\". Upon returning from Seattle, she meets Morgan and Garcia, who had just returned from their visit to Prentiss in England, and the latter has an embarrassing introductory moment with Blake. Blake then assists the team in their investigation of an escaped convict revealed to be the infamous serial killer \\"The Silencer\\". She and Reid work together in trying to deduce a meaning behind messages left behind by the unsub, and when the Silencer is properly identified and tracked down, Blake attempts to talk him down, communicating with him via sign language, as he is deaf. Her attempt to reach him is unsuccessful and he commits suicide. At the end of the episode, Blake and Garcia meet up and redo their introductions, starting a friendship. In \\"God Complex\\", she notices that Reid is acting strangely, and when he asks her to drop him off at a payphone, she does so and then asks him what is going on. Reid promptly tells her that he has started calling a woman named Maeve Donovan in a potential romantic relationship, and that he did not wish to tell this to anyone else. Blake promises not to tell anyone. By the end of the episode, Morgan tells Reid that he knows his secret, but from Garcia. Reid then thanks Blake while she is still sleeping. In \\"The Good Earth\\", Blake assists in the current investigation and is able to successfully talk down the delusional unsub, allowing for an arrest. In \\"Magnum Opus\\", she is able to deduce the motivation behind the unsub's killings and particularly embraces Reid's return to the BAU after a brief leave following Maeve's death. In \\"Carbon Copy\\", she finally accepts an apology given by Strauss, who wanted to make amends following the Amerithrax case. In \\"#6\\", James makes a surprise visit to her home. He tries telling her something, but before he could complete his announcement, Blake receives a call from the BAU, and she is forced to leave and investigate a case. James approves, knowing that it is her job. By the end of the episode, she returns home, and James finally tells her that he had been offered a job as a professor at Harvard University, and that he agreed to take it if Blake came with him and took up a position as a linguistics professor. He then cites that the two had wanted to be a \\"real couple\\" again, and that this was their opportunity. However, Blake turns him down, saying that she was attached to her current job. Expecting that response, James agrees to the terms she offers, in which she would visit him on weekends and holidays. In \\"Brothers Hotchner\\", she volunteers to drive Strauss back to her New York City hotel room after the team solves a case. In the following episode, a serial killer and stalker known as the Replicator abducts and kills Strauss. The ensuing investigation reveals that the Replicator has a personal vendetta against Blake, since he had been copying unsubs the team apprehended following her induction into the BAU. As a result, they find the Replicator's first victim, a woman killed in the style of the serial killer she and the team captured in Seattle last year. They then identify the Replicator as John Curtis, a brilliant but reclusive FBI agent who investigated the Amerithrax case alongside Blake and Strauss; he was targeting the BAU because he too was set up for a fall by Strauss after the wrong arrest. As a result, Curtis had been severely demoted, and when Blake was able to rise back to the top by resuming work with the BAU, he became jealous and targeted the team, especially Blake. When the team heads over to a stretch of land owned by Curtis's family, the helicopter carrying her, Reid, and Hotch is hacked into by Curtis and crash-lands. Curtis then ambushes the passengers, knocking them out with knock-out gas and abducting Blake, taking her into a house rigged with multiple explosives. He places her on a seat specifically designed to trigger the countdown process, and when she regains consciousness, Curtis rants to her about the success she achieved while he continued to suffer from his demotion. He then leaves, just as the rest of the BAU, save for Rossi, who was forced to stay behind after a poisoning incident, burst in to rescue her. However, they are all trapped inside the room; Curtis's intention was to ultimately kill the team with the bombs. Garcia manages to counteract the countdown, giving Rossi (who went to the house on his own accord) enough time to rescue the trapped agents, including Blake. Rossi then traps Curtis inside the room, just before it explodes, presumably killing him. Blake later celebrates Strauss's life with the rest of the team. Season nine In the episode \\"In The Blood\\", Blake attends Garcia's \\"Day of the Dead\\"-themed party. When the team begins setting up photos of family members or close friends that are currently dead, Blake puts up a photo of her mother and tells them about how she helped give her a love of crossword puzzles, which in turn, inspired her to pursue a linguistics career. In the episode \\"Bully\\", Blake investigated a case in Los Angeles with the rest of the team and wound up being shot in the arm by the unsub while trying to stop him from killing a woman he abducted. Moments afterward, she received a call from Damon, who asked her to return to her hometown of Kansas City, as he was suspicious of the murder of a jogger, which he traced an apparent connection to the murders of two high-school students. Blake agrees and takes the BAU to Kansas City, where she is greeted by him and is shown to have Damon's higher opinion over that of Scott, with whom she has tension. Later on, when Scott is beaten unconscious by the unsub as he interrogates a man named Charles Gates (who is then killed by the unsub), Blake and Damon both fall into despair in the wake of the attack, and the former becomes more connected to the case than ever. The unsub is eventually arrested the next night, and the following day, Blake drives Scott to the family home, where he realizes finally that she had been shot, something she never disclosed to him or Damon. She admits that she never visited her family or even gave them a phone call because she felt that by doing so, she would be reminded of their late mother and brother. The two then make amends as they have a barbecue with Damon and the entire BAU team. In the episode \\"200\\", she assisted the rest of the team in finding JJ and FBI Section Chief Director Mateo Cruz when both go missing. During the search, the BAU resorts to the help of Prentiss, whom Blake replaced, and the two of them met for the first time. At the end of the episode, Blake expresses her happiness in finally meeting the agent the others have told her about. In \\"Mr. & Mrs. Anderson\\", Blake leads the interrogation of Judith Anderson, who requests to make a phone call to Alan, but Blake denies the request and asks about Alan's sexually-transmitted disease, to which she replies that she knew about it and that they no longer kept secrets. Blake then shows her photos of women that Alan killed alone, but she continues to protect him and asks for a lawyer. Later, Blake tells Judith that Alan tried to rape and kill Kathleen Benedict before promising her that if she is cooperative, she will move to get her sentence reduced. When Judith refuses to take up the offer, Blake tells her that the necklace Alan gave her earlier was stolen from a victim that he killed alone the same night he gave it to her. This enrages her, and when she sees him as he is being taken into the police station, she angrily slaps him, throws the necklace in his face, and declares that she hates him. In the episode \\"Blood Relations\\", Blake assisted the team in the search for an unsub in West Virginia. Upon arrival at the shack where the unsub was conceived, the team decides to split up in the forest to cover more ground. Blake searches her area alone and informs Morgan that she has eyes on Cissy Howard, whom the unsub had rigged to a tree. The unsub then appears and tackles Blake and they both fall into the water, with Blake pulling her trigger aimlessly. One bullet grazes the unsub in the head, apparently knocking him unconscious and causing both to submerge into the water, and when Morgan, Rossi, and JJ call out for Blake, JJ notices some bubbles in the lake. Blake resurfaces and orders them to \\"shoot everywhere\\", but when they can't find a body, Blake gets worried. She dries off, and talks with JJ about how she's doing. JJ insists that the unsub is dead, and Blake repeats this to herself. However, the unsub is shown to be alive and well, attacking a couple in Kentucky. =Departure= In the season 9 two-part finale, \\"Angels\\" and \\"Demons\\", Blake becomes distraught and depressed when Reid is shot in the neck by the unsub after pushing Blake out of the way and nearly dies, even commenting that it should have been her who was shot instead. She is also further upset when rescuing a young boy who was being used by the unsub as leverage against his mother. Though Reid survives, Alex is greatly shaken by the case, and reveals to Reid that both he and the young boy reminded her of her deceased son Ethan, who died of an unnamed neurological disease at age 9. Her guilt and distress over Reid's brush with death touched a major nerve with her, seemingly pushing her to the breaking point. At the end of the \\"Demons\\", she sits apart from the rest of the group on the plane ride home, and it is implied that she sends a text message to Hotch handing in her resignation. After taking Reid home, telling him about Ethan, and departing, Reid finds her FBI badge in his bag, and watches her leave, saddened but accepting, from his window. In the first episode of season 10 it was confirmed that she had left to return to teaching.

Six people were convicted of their alleged murders on the basis of confessions extracted by the police after intense and lengthy interrogations despite the lack of bodies of the murder victims, witnesses or any forensic evidence. In later years, most Icelanders believe the six were wrongfully convicted. On 27 September 2018, 44 years after the disappearances of Guðmundur and Geirfinnur, the Supreme Court of Iceland acquitted five of the six original suspects. Disappearances On the night of 26 January 1974, Guðmundur Einarsson, an 18-year-old labourer, was walking back from the community hall (Alþýðuhúsið) in Hafnarfjörður to his home, away. He was last seen by a motorist after he nearly fell in front of a vehicle and has not been seen since. Ten months later, on 19 November 1974, Geirfinnur Einarsson, a 32-year-old construction worker unrelated to Guðmundur, received a phone call while at home and drove a short distance to the harbour cafe in Keflavik. He left the keys in the ignition, but failed to return to the car. Extensive searches around the harbour and coast did not find a body, and, although the police in Iceland are regularly informed of people who disappear in snowstorms without motive, witnesses, forensic evidence or bodies, a murder inquiry was opened. The Icelandic Police were under intense public, media and justice pressure to solve these cases. Investigation and prosecutions Six suspects, Sævar Ciesielski, Kristján Viðar Viðarsson, Tryggvi Rúnar Leifsson, Albert Klahn Skaftason, Guðjón Skarphéðinsson and Erla Bolladóttir, eventually signed confessions to murder, even though they had no clear memory of committing the crimes. They had been kept in isolation, interviewed at length under pressure with little contact allowed with their lawyers. They were given drugs (Mogadon, diazepam and chlorpromazine) and subjected to sleep deprivation and water torture, particularly the alleged ringleader, Sævar Ciesielski, who had a fear of water. He also said that the drugs which were supposed to help him sleep had affected his memory. The suspects said they signed the confessions in order to put an end to their solitary confinement. For example, Erla Bolladóttir was held in solitary confinement for 242 days; two were kept under solitary confinement for over 600 days, one of whom, Tryggvi Rúnar Leifsson, for 655 days—the longest solitary confinement outside of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Sævar Cieselski was kept in custody for a total of 1533 days. In 1976, Einar Bollason, the chairman of the Icelandic Basketball Federation, sat innocent for 105 days in solitary confinement, along with Magnús Leópoldsson, Valdimar Olsen and Sigurbjörn Eiríksson, after Einar's half-sister, Erla Bolladóttir, and other suspects had implicated them in the case. Sævar Marinó, Kristján Viðar and Tryggvi Rúnar were convicted for killing Guðmundur while Albert Klahn was convicted for helping to hide the body. Sævar Marinó, Kristján Viðar and Guðjón were later convicted for killing Geirfinnur Einarsson while Erla Bolladóttir was convicted of perjury after she implicated her half-brother and others in the disappearance. Aftermath In a speech in Alþingi in 1998, then Prime Minister of Iceland, Davíð Oddsson, heavily criticized the investigation and prosecution of the case after the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled that it could not rehear the case. In 2018 it was revealed that Davíð had given Sævar financial support and advice to help him get the case reheard. Tryggvi Rúnar died in 2009, after battling cancer, while Sævar Ciesielski died after an accident in Denmark in 2011. The case was made public in a BBC radio programme in May 2014, which discussed the apparent memory implantation.Zoe Williams, The Reykjavik Confessions, The Guardian, UK, 16 May 2014 Professor Gísli Guðjónsson, a former Icelandic detective and internationally renowned expert on suggestibility and false confessions, investigated this case and concluded: \\"I've worked on miscarriages of justice in many different countries. I've testified in several countries - hundreds of cases I’ve done, big cases. I'd never come across any case where there had been such intense interrogation, so many interrogations and such lengthy solitary confinement. I mean I was absolutely shocked when I saw that.\\" Most Icelanders came to believe the case had been a bad miscarriage of justice, and the BBC described it as \\"one of the most shocking miscarriages of justice Europe has ever witnessed.\\" Retrial In 2013, an official police investigation report was handed to the office of the State Prosecutor. On February 24, 2017, the Interior Ministry's Rehearing Committee concluded that the cases of Sævar Ciesielski, Kristján Viðar Viðarsson, Tryggvi Rúnar Leifsson, Albert Klahn Skaftason and Guðjón Skarphéðinsson should be reheard by the Supreme Court of Iceland. However, the committee did not recommend a retrial for Erla Bolladóttir's perjury case. In February 2018, the State Prosecutor requested that the Supreme Court acquit Sævar Ciesielski, Kristján Viðar Viðarsson, Tryggvi Rúnar Leifsson, Albert Klahn Skaftason, Guðjón Skarphéðinsson, and Erla Bolladóttir. On 27 September 2018, the Supreme Court acquitted all five men, but did not reverse Erla Bolladóttir's conviction. Media A documentary directed by Dylan Howitt called Out of Thin Air was released in 2017. The film was inspired by the BBC programme. An Icelandic film called Imagine Murder () was being made about the case in 2017. Directed by Egill Örn Egilsson, the film was scheduled to premiere in 2019.

Radziwiłł Chronicle Theodore the Varangian and his son John (10th century) were the first known Christian martyrs in Rus'.  Biography  Born in the 10th century, Theodore served in Byzantium for a long time, where he took holy baptism. He then moved to live in the city of Kiev. He had a son John, who also professed Christianity. He was one of the best prince combatants. In ancient manuscripts are the following writing pagan named of Theodore: Tur (Scandinavian Thor) or Utor (Scandinavian Ottar). St Nestor the Chronicler in his Primary Chronicle reports \\"And the elders and boyars said: 'let us cast lots upon the boys and girls. Upon whichever one it falls, that one we shall slaughter in sacrifice to the gods. The lots thrown by the pagan priests, evidently not by chance, fell upon the Christian John. When the messengers told Theodore that his son \\"had been chosen by the gods themselves to be sacrificed to them\\", the old warrior decisively answered: “This is not a god, but wood. Today it is, and tomorrow it rots. They do not eat, nor drink nor speak, but are crafted by human hands from wood. God however is One, and the Greeks serve and worship Him. He created heaven and earth, the stars and the moon, the sun and man, and foreordained him to live upon the earth. But these gods, what have they created? They themselves are made. I shall not give my son over to devils.” The exact date of the death of Theodore and John is unknown. According to the basic version, their demise came July 12, 978, the day after the first period pagan celebrations in Kiev, associated with a campaign Vladimir of Kiev and its succession to the throne July 11, 978 accompanied by the ascension of thanksgiving to the gods and committing human sacrifices. His march to Kiev in the year in addition to military and political objectives pursued also religious problem: it was an attempt to Variagian-Russian paganism to suppress nascent Christianity in Kiev. It is also believed that this event could happen later - in the summer of the year 983, during the revolt of the Gentiles throughout the Slavic-Germanic world. It is believed that the events associated with the death of Theodore and John to some extent influenced the decision of Vladimir to become a Christian. It shocked him what had happened, namely the courage with which the Theodore alone stand against the crowd of angry pagan people, which could be revealed only in the protection of the right things.

His early career was based on mimicry: he became a popular favourite, able to continue in highly-paid work, despite drinking heavily and not learning his parts. John Reeve as Tom the Ostler, c.1836 Early life The son of Thomas Reeve, a hosier and common councillor, and nephew of William Reeve and Robert Waithman, he was born at his father's shop on Ludgate Hill, on 2 February 1799. At school at Winchmore Hill under a Mr. Thompson, he had for companion Frederick Henry Yates. From age 14 behind his father's counter for two years, when his father retired, he was placed with a firm of wholesale hosiers named Nevill or Neville in Maiden Lane, Wood Street, lasting three years there. As a clerk in Gosling's Bank on Fleet Street, Reeve with colleagues hired every two weeks Pym's Theatre, Wilson Street, off Gray's Inn Road. Pym was an ex-actor, who had fitted up an assembly room as an upmarket \\"private theatre\\", a place for well-supported amateur theatricals. Finding himself in obscure parts, Reeve hired the house on his own account for £10, and played Othello, with his friend George Herbert Bonaparte Rodwell as Roderigo, and Sylvester Daggerwood, an actor, in a farce based on New Hay at the Old Market George Colman the younger. He repeated \\"Sylvester Daggerwood\\" on 8 and 9 June 1819 at Drury Lane, in benefits for Thomas Rodwell and Gesualdo Lanza; and then played it for a few nights at the Haymarket Theatre. On the London stage Reeve was offered an engagement by Samuel James Arnold at the Lyceum Theatre. He appeared there on 17 July 1819, under the name of Mr. *, as Harry Alias in One, Two, Three, Four, Five by Advertisement, by John Hamilton Reynolds; the cast included William Farren, John Pritt Harley, Charles Mathews, and Joseph Munden. He resigned his post at the bank, and he played two other characters, Pedrillo and Crack, at the Lyceum, but the press only gave him credit as a mimic. The Rodwells with Willis Jones took the Sans-Pareil Theatre in the Strand, and opened it on 18 October 1819 as the Adelphi Theatre. Reeve appeared there as Squire Rattlepate in William Thomas Moncrieff's burletta, The Green Dragon, or I've quite forgot, and Lord Grizzle in a burlesque of Tom Thumb. Feeling inexperienced, Reeve then joined William Macready the elder's company in Bristol, and for once took on comic Shakespearean characters. Back at the Adelphi, he succeeded Watkins Burroughs as Jerry Hawthorn in Moncrieff's adaptation from Pierce Egan's Tom and Jerry, or Life in London, a character he made his own. At the close of the season he gave in 1823 at the Adelphi, with James Pimbury Wilkinson, an entertainment called Trifles light as Air, and declaimed a \\"monopolylogue\\", Bachelor's Torments; Wilkinson left, but he continued the entertainment alone.He imitated Edmund Kean successfully in Quadrupeds (based on The Tailors; or, A tragedy for warm weather by Samuel Foote), played in a drama called Killigrew; or, King Charles at Tunbridge Wells, was the first Boroughcliffe in Edward Fitzball's version of The Pilot, and played in Egan's Life of an Actor. Reeve went on to play at the Surrey Theatre and the Cobourg Theatre, rising high in public estimation. On 17 April 1826, with a salary of £13 a week, he made as Ralph, a comic servant, in Prince Hoare's Lock and Key, what was inaccurately announced as his first appearance at the Haymarket.Caleb Quotem in The Review, or Wags of Windsor (George Colman), Old Wiggins, a glutton, in John Till Allingham's Mrs. Wiggins, Somno in The Sleep Walker (Walley Chamberlain Oulton), Nipperkin in Sprigs of Laurel, or the Rival Soldiers (John O'Keeffe), Nehemiah Flam in The Gay Deceivers (George Colman the younger), Scout in The Village Lawyer (adapted by Charles Lyons, from L'avocat Patelin by de Brueys and Palaprat), Crack in The Turnpike Gate (Thomas Knight), Davy in Bon Ton (David Garrick), Major Sturgeon in The Mayor of Garratt (Samuel Foote), Ollapod in The Poor Gentleman (Colman), Sir Solomon Gander in Love and Gout (Robert Francis Jameson), Multiple in Actor of all Work (Colman the younger), Major Dumpling in The Green Man (Richard Jones, from L'homme gris of D'Aubigny and Poujol), Maurice Holster, an original part, in Thirteen to the Dozen (adaptation of Le conspirateur sans le savoir; ou, les manteaux, by cribe, Varner, and Dupin), Buskin in Killing no Murder (Theodore Edward Hook), Peter Smink, an original part, in Peter Smink, or which is the Miller? (John Howard Payne), Bob Acres, Dicky Gossip in My Grandmother (Prince Hoare), were acted during the season. He had established his position in comedy, and opened the Haymarket season on 15 June 1827 with Paul Pry.He played, among other characters, Lubin Log in Love, Law, and Physic (James Kenney), Midas, Mawworm, Clod in The Young Quaker (O'Keeffe), Pengander in Twixt the Cup and the Lip (John Poole), and was the first Gabriel Gudgeon in Gudgeons and Sharks (Poole), and Barnaby Boxem, an undertaker, in You must be buried. On 17 June 1828 he reappeared as Figaro.Playing during the season Don Ferolo in The Critic, Ephraim Smooth in Wild Oats, Tony Lumpkin and Sir Peter Pigwinnin, and the original Peters in The Barber Baron, or the Frankfort Lottery (Thomas James Thackeray). In 1829 he added to his repertory Pierre in The Rencontre (James Robinson Planché), April in Secrets Worth Knowing (Thomas Morton), Adam Brock in Charles the Twelfth (Planché), Sancho in Barataria: Or, Sancho Turn'd Governor (Frederick Pilon), Cosey in Town and Country (Morton), and was the first Sadi in Nothing Superfluous (libretto C. Pelham Thompson, music George Alexander Lee), William Thomson the Second in Caroline Boaden's William Thompson, or which is he?, and John Bates in Procrastination (Howard Payne). In 1830 he played his last season at the Haymarket:Grojan in Quite Correct (Caroline Boaden, from a novel by Hook), Pedrigo Potts in John of Paris (Isaac Pocock), Lissardo in The Wonder (Susannah Centlivre), Gregory Gubbins in the Battle of Hexham (Colman), Apollo Belvi in Killing no Murder, and Whimsiculo in The Cabinet, and was the original Madrigal Merry-patch in Honest Frauds (Joseph Lunn). quarrelling with the management on a question of terms, he played at the Adelphi, on 21 October 1830, Magog in John Baldwin Buckstone's Wreck Ashore, and then went to Covent Garden, where he was considered to have failed. John Reeve (centre) as Bill Mattock, in The Queer Subject by Joseph Stirling Coyne, a part he played at the Adelphi Theatre in November 1836 It was with the Adelphi that Reeve's main triumphs in original parts were associated.Here he played in a burlesque of Cupid, was in January 1833 Sancho Panza in Don Quixote, and acted in Anna Maria Hall's Grace Huntley and other pieces. After playing two years at the Queen's Theatre, he went, in 1835, to America, where he was well paid but did not win over the audience. Last years Returning, at a salary of £40 a week to the Adelphi Theatre, now under the management of Frederick Henry Yates, Reeve appeared in a piece entitled Novelty, a framework for his American adventures. From early in his career, he had been a heavy drinker, often forgetting his lines. During 1836 he was to have played at the Surrey the main part in The Skeleton Witness, but at the final rehearsal he knew none of his words, and that night he sent a note of apology. Davidge, the manager, explained to the audience that the actor was being paid £30 a week. In 1837 Reeve played Sam Weller in the Peregrinations of Pickwick, and was seen in other characters. Reeve's last appearance in 1837 was at the Surrey Theatre, with some of the Adelphi company. He performed poorly in a part he had chosen in a new drama, The Wandering Tribe, and returning from the theatre after the second show, he broke a blood-vessel. He died at his house, 46 Brompton Row, on 24 January 1838, and was buried in Brompton churchyard. His comedian replacement at the Adelphi was Henry Roxby Beverley. Reputation Douglas Bannister, biographer of Reeve, said he was just a farceur and droll, a follower of the style of William Oxberry. He was on winking terms with his audience, in a way not seen since George Frederick Cooke: the managers John Baldwin Buckstone and Richard Brinsley Peake fed him with short sentences, bywords, and opportunities for business, instead of speeches, which he would not learn. He remained a favourite with the public, and managers still hired him, knowing full well his drink problem and unreliability. Family Reeve was twice married. By his first wife, a Miss Aylett, daughter of an upholsterer in Finsbury, and a dancer in Macready's company, whom he married at Bristol in 1820, he left a son John, a burlesque actor; she died at his birth in 1822 at Swansea. By his second wife he had two daughters.

Based on the 1998 book/memoir of the same name by Bill Bryson, it was released on September 2, 2015, by Broad Green Pictures. Plot Author Bill Bryson (Robert Redford), after living for ten years in the UK, he moved to New Hampshire. Now in his 60s, he had been living there peacefully. A television interview reports that he has published several popular books and there is speculation he will be writing more. Bryson, however, has no such plans. Bryson and his wife Catherine (Emma Thompson) attend a funeral. Not being an outgoing person, he afterwards takes a stroll up to the nearby Appalachian Trail. He suddenly decides he will hike its entire length. Catherine objects, presenting all kinds of accounts about accidents and murders on the trail. She relents on condition that he not travel alone. He agrees and searches for a friend willing to join him. Everyone declines his invitation; some declare him insane. Finally, he is contacted by Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte), an old friend who offers to be a hiking companion. Despite appearances, Stephen claims to be fit enough for the challenge. Bill's wife is unhappy with his choice, but relents. Within less than a mile of their departure point, as groups of hikers overtake and pass them, they begin to grasp the difficulty of their ambition. Shortly after, a group of young children effortlessly runs by them up the trail, laughing and calling out to each other. Seeing others pass by so easily motivates them to carry on. And so they move on, day by day, making more or less pleasant acquaintances, having more or less pleasant experiences. Some time later they reach a hut, having hiked miserably through pouring rain. Carved into the log wall is an Appalachian Trail map showing the trail and their present location. They realize they have finished less than half of the trail after spending three months on it. Eventually they trek into a restricted section posted \\"for experienced hikers only\\". While maneuvering their heavy and awkward backpacks alongside a precipitous drop, Bill trips and pulls Stephen with him down a steep, rocky cliff. They fall about fifteen feet onto a ledge spacious enough to be comfortable, but far enough below the trail to be unable to get back up to resume the hike. They spend the night there with no clear hope of rescue. Luckily, the next day they are awoken by early morning hikers who are able to get them off the ledge. Eventually, they decide they have had enough and end their journey. When comfortably back at home, Bill, going through his mail, finds a series of post cards from Stephen that were mailed from their various stops along the trail. The last one reads: \\"What's next?' Bill sits down and begins typing on his computer, \\"A WALK IN THE WOODS.\\" Cast * Robert Redford as Bill Bryson * Nick Nolte as Stephen Katz * Emma Thompson as Catherine Bryson * Kristen Schaal as Mary Ellen * Nick Offerman as REI Dave * Mary Steenburgen as Jeannie * Hayley Lovitt as Donna Production The project dates back to at least 2005, when Robert Redford first announced his plans to make the film. At various points directors such as Chris Columbus, Barry Levinson and Larry Charles were involved. However, Ken Kwapis ended up directing the picture. Redford initially wanted Paul Newman to costar in the film with him, to the point where Redford temporarily abandoned the project after Newman's death, unable to picture any other actor suitable for the role. However, while directing The Company You Keep, Redford was so impressed by the performance of Nick Nolte that he was eventually cast in the role. Redford said of the project: Larry Charles (of Borat and Brüno) was briefly attached as director, but eventually the job went to Ken Kwapis, whose most recent film was Big Miracle and who was a key figure on the U.S. television series The Office. =Filming= Principal photography of the film began on May 5, 2014, in Los Angeles. Exterior locations were largely filmed at Amicalola Falls State Park, in Dawsonville, Georgia, including scenes at The Lodge at Amicalola Falls. Release The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2015. Shortly after, Broad Green Pictures acquired distribution rights to the film, and gave it a wide theatrical release starting September 2, 2015. Reception A Walk in the Woods has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 47%, based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 5.42/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Amiable yet less compelling than any road trip movie starring Robert Redford and Nick Nolte should be, A Walk in the Woods is ultimately a bit too pedestrian.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale.

This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein needed for the flavination of a succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit required for activity of the complex. Mutations in this gene are associated with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.  Structure  SDHAF2 is located on the q arm of Chromosome 11 in position 12.2 and spans 16,642 base pairs. The SDHAF2 gene produces a 6.7 kDa protein composed of 65 amino acids. This highly conserved protein is a cofactor of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The structure represents a five-helix bundle with a region of well-defined conserved surface residues. This conserved region includes a negatively charged periphery and a positively charged surface, and a patch that is hydrophobic. The region is located in α-helices I, II, and the connecting band.  Function  The SDHAF2 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein associated with the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex (mitochondrial complex II) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which plays essential roles in both the electron transport chain and the Krebs(tricarboxylic acid) cycle. SDHAF2 is integral in the proper function of the SDH complex, mainly in SDH-dependent respiration, and interacts with the catalytic subunit of the complex. SDHAF2 participates in the flavination of SDH1(SDHA), another subunit of the SDH complex. It does so by incorporating the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor into SDHA. Such flavination is required for a fully functional SDH complex. Knockdown of SDHAF2 leads to the loss-of- function of the SDH complex, a decrease in the enzyme complex stability, and a substantial reduction in all subunits. SDHAF2 was also found to function as a tumor suppressor.  Clinical significance  SDHAF2 is a tumor suppressor gene. Constitutional mutations in this gene cause hereditary paraganglioma, a neuroendocrine tumor formerly known to be linked to SDH subunit mutations. paraganglioma is a neural crest tumor usually derived from the chemoreceptor tissue of a paraganglion, and may develop at various body sites, including the head, neck, thorax and abdomen. Most commonly, they are located in the head and neck region, specifically at the carotid bifurcation, the jugular foramen, the vagus nerve, and in the middle ear. Phenotypes include excessive catecholamine induced hypertension, dysfunction of major blood vessels and cranial nerves, significant morbidity, sweating, and palpitations. In cases of extra-adrenal localization, the tumor may turn metastatic and aggressive. Loss of SDH complex function has been known to be responsible for paraganglioma. Mutations in this gene are found in the DNA of only a small fraction of patients with the disease.  Interactions  SDHAF2 interacts with SDHA within the SDH catalytic dimer. In addition to SDHA, SDHAF2 has 17 protein- protein interactions, including interactions with proteins such as IMMT, SUCLG2, UBINEDDSUMO1, SSX2IP, and others.

It reinforces the English case of Tool Metal Mfg Co ltd v Tungsten Electric Co Ltd [1955] 2 All ER 657. Background Mr and Mrs P decided to separate, and in 1935 the two entered into a separation agreement requiring the husband to pay the wife maintenance at the rate of £6 10s a month. In 1942, the wife was committed to a mental hospital, which resulted in the Public Trust being appointed her legal guardian. Eventually, on 22 February 1952, Mr P was able to obtain a divorce from the court, with the court awarding Mrs P a token one shilling (10 cents!) a year in maintenance. The Public Trust subsequently advised Mr P that the new divorce order cancelled the previous settlement agreement and wrote to him on 10 July 1952 saying \\"The Court Order which you loaned is returned with thanks. The order cancels the previous separation agreement but it will be necessary to collect the arrears of maintenance up to which the date becomes effective - namely, 22nd February, 1952.\\" Several years later, the Public Trust realised that this legal position was incorrect, as the original separation agreement was still legally enforceable. That being the case, the Public Trust then demanded Mr P to pay the arrears under the original agreement, which was calculated to be £346 1s 5d as of 1 August 1956. This left Mr P in a frustrating position, as if he had known that the original separation agreement was still enforceable, he could have applied to the court to have it set aside. The Public Trust sued Mr P in the District Court and won judgment against him. Mr P appealed. Decision The High Court ruled that promissory estoppel applied here meaning the Public Trust were unable to enforce the agreement, as Mr P would have been able to apply to have the separation agreement set aside had it not been for the incorrect advice from the Public Trust.

It is currently part of the Flinders Chase National Park. Description Paisley Islet is approximately west south-west of Kingscote. It is an extension of the southern headland of West Bay and is only separated from the mainland by tide or wind driven waves. It can be reached by walking along the rock isthmus at low tide. Formation, geology and oceanography Paisley Islet was formed about 7500 years ago after sea levels rose at the start of the Holocene. The islet consists of basement rock of Kanmantoo group metasandstone which extends to the mainland. The central portion of the islet is topped with a layer of Bridgewater Formation calcarenite which is in turn capped with a layer of calcrete. Layers of soil lie in depressions within the calcrete layer. The islet is located in waters of a depth of about that partially conceal wave-cut platforms and that are subject to rolling seas. Flora and fauna As of 1996, the rim of the calcarenite cap has been colonised by roundleaved pigface, and sea celery. Species found on the central portion of the islet included dwarfed marsh saltbush, nitre-bush, southern sea-heath and ruby saltbush. Species such as feather spear-grass and variable groundsel appear after seasonal rain. Vertebrate animals were represented by birds, mammals and reptiles. A survey conducted in 1996 found that the islet is used as a breeding site, possibly during milder weather, for crested terns and as a site for roosting and feeding by red-capped dotterels, sooty oystercatchers, rock parrots, welcome swallows and Richard's pipit. It was also observed that the islet was being used as a haul out by bull Australian sea lions. The four-toed earless skink was the only reptile found in 1996. Protected area status The islet is part of the Flinders Chase National Park and has been specifically proclaimed as a prohibited area in order to protect breeding seabirds such as crested terns. Since December 2012, the waters around the islet has been part of a habitat protection zone located within the boundaries of the Western Kangaroo Island Marine Park.

Charles Blachford Mansfield Early life He was born on 8 May 1819 at Rowner, Hampshire, where his father, John Mansfield, was rector; his mother was Winifred, eldest daughter of Robert Pope Blachford of Osborne House, Isle of Wight. He was educated first at a private school at Twyford, Hampshire, and then at Winchester College. At age his health broke down, and he passed a year with a private tutor in the country. On 23 November 1836 he entered his name at Clare Hall, Cambridge, but did not begin residence till October. With too frequent absences from ill-health, he did not graduate B.A. till 1846 (M.A. 1849). Chemist Mansfield read widely, and gathered friends round him: with Charles Kingsley, a contemporary at Cambridge, he formed a lifelong friendship. While still at Cambridge he attended medical classes at St. George's Hospital; but when he settled in London in 1846 he concentrated on chemistry. In 1848, after completing a course at the Royal College of Chemistry, he undertook, at August Wilhelm Hofmann's request, a series of experiments leading to the extraction of benzole from coal-tar, important for the dye industry. He patented his inventions, but others reaped the profits. In the Chartist crisis of 1848-9 Mansfield joined Frederick Denison Maurice, Kingsley, and others in their efforts at social reform among the workmen of London; and in the cholera year helped to provide pure water for districts like Bermondsey, where every drop was sewage-tainted. In the winter of 1851–1852, he delivered at the Royal Institution a course of lectures on the chemistry of the metals, with an attempted classification. Visit to Paraguay In summer 1852 Mansfield started for Paraguay. He arrived at Buenos Ayres in August, and having obtained permission from Justo José de Urquiza to go up the Paraná River, he reached Asunción on 24 November, and remained there two and a half months. Paraguay, under José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia and his successor Carlos Antonio López, had been closed to the world outside for 40 years, and Mansfield was, if not the first English visitor to the capital, certainly the first to go there simply to investigate. Last years Mansfield returned to England in the spring of 1853, resumed his chemical studies. He had been invited to send specimens of benzole to the Paris Exhibition of 1855, and on 17 February 1855, while he was preparing these in a room which he had hired for the purpose in St. John's Wood, a naphtha still overflowed, and Mansfield was so injured that nine days later he died in Middlesex Hospital, at age 35. Works Benzol, its Nature and Utility (1849) was a pamphlet. Mansfield's major work in chemistry was the Theory of Salts, completed in 1855. In September 1850 a balloon machine constructed at Paris led to his Aerial Navigation. Mansfield wrote several papers in Politics for the People, edited by Maurice and John Malcolm Forbes Ludlow, and then in the Christian Socialist. His letters from South America, published as Paraguay, Brazil and the Plate (1856) by Kingsley, contain descriptions of Paraguayan society, scenery, plant and bird life, and a scheme for the colonisation of the Gran Chaco; a sketch of the history of Paraguay formed the concluding chapter of the volume. His earlier letters, printed in the same volume, deal in a similar manner with Brazil. These were translated into Portuguese by Antonio Diodoro de Pascual, and published along with critical essays on Mansfield's narrative at Rio Janeiro (1861–2).

The space or room inside of Rumah Lontiok are classified into three different spaces ; they are lower space, central space, and back space. The classification of those spaces are adjusted to the terms “ Alam nan tigo” or “ universe of three divisions “ , a concept of sociality in society. They are berkawan (friendship), bersamak (kinship) , and semalu (bashfulness). Lower and central spaces, separated by a wooden wall, are the main house.

There Thomas Carter composed music for his Fair American libretto: Pilon would not pay, Carter sued, and Pilon lay low. Pilon died at Lambeth on 17 January 1788. Works Pilon as a playwright has been thought a follower of Richard Cumberland, an associate of the Della Cruscans, and an admirer of Anthony Pasquin. He wrote the following dramas, mostly ephemeral, all of which were published, besides the pantomime: * The Invasion, or a Trip to Brighthelmstone, farce, performed at Covent Garden Theatre, on 4 November 1778 with Lee Lewis in the main part Cameleon. It was repeated twenty-four times during the season, and later was several times revived. This work ran simultaneously with The Camp, which also made play of the invasion scare of the time. *The Liverpool Prize, Covent Garden 22 February 1779, with John Quick in the main part. * Illumination, or the Glazier's Conspiracy, a prelude, suggested by the illuminations on Admiral Keppel's acquittal, acted on 12 April 1779 for Lee Lewis's benefit. *The Device, or the Deaf Doctor; when first produced on 27 September 1779, it was unpopular, but, revived with alterations as The Deaf Lover, on 2 February 1780, it achieved some success. *The Touchstone, 1779, pantomime. * The Siege of Gibraltar, a musical farce (25 April 1780), celebrated Rodney's victory in the Great Siege of Gibraltar. *The Humours of an Election, a farce (19 October 1780), satirised electoral corruption. * Thelyphthora, or more Wives than One, a farce, satirising the book Thelyphthora by Martin Madan, was produced on 8 March 1781, and was withdrawn after the second night. * At Drury Lane, Pilon produced, on 18 May 1782, The Fair American, a comic opera, crudely plagiarised from the Adventures of Five Hours by Samuel Tuke. * Aerostation, or the Templar's Stratagem (29 October 1784), dealt with the vogue for ballooning. * Barataria, or Sancho turned Governor (29 March 1785), adapted from Thomas d'Urfey. \\"Pure farce\\". *He would be a Soldier, a comedy, after being rejected by George Colman, was performed at Covent Garden on 18 November 1786, with success. An unpublished adaptation of All's Well That Ends Well was in three acts, and considered representative of contemporary taste. Cuts fell on the early parts, and the centre of attention was the character of Parolles. It was performed in 1785 at the Haymarket Theatre. Pilon published in 1785 an expanded edition of George Alexander Stevens's Essay on Heads, which Lee Lewis had been performing from 1780. The Lecture was a popular one-man show, a two-hour performance piece that Stevens had acted as a monologue, with a range of papier-mâché busts and wigs, from 1764. Lewis had purchased the Lecture from Stevens, and this edition had a prologue by Pilon, and An Essay on Satire of his own. Pilon also adapted The French Flogged (1755) by Stevens (a droll for Edward Shuter) for performance at Cork in 1780. Pilon published also: * The Drama, an anonymous poem, 1775. * An Essay on the Character of Hamlet as performed by Mr. Henderson (anonymous), London, 1777. On John Henderson. Family In 1787 Pilon married a Miss Drury of Kingston, Surrey.

It is bordered to the west by Valle Scrivia.  History  The canyon as seen from above showing the Borbera river and the road paralleling it The valley is surrounded by high mountains, making it a place isolated from the surrounding valleys, little touched by industrialization and with a well-preserved environment. Up until the beginning of the 20th century, there was no road connecting the upper with the lower valley, the main passageway being the gravel riverbed in the dry season. It is the only valley of Piedmont bordering on the Emilia-Romagna region. Until about the 1950s, viticulture was very widespread, especially in the lower valley. Today, a special grape variety is still cultivated in the valley, the Timorasso, which is known and appreciated even outside the valley. There are a lot of chestnut woods in the valley, but chestnuts are no longer harvested as before. Also, the water mills in the valley are no longer in operation, so chestnut flour is now produced outside the valley. Val Borbera is also known for a special kind of potatoes, namely the patata quarantina bianca genovese, and the fagiolane, a rather large, white bean that is very appreciated and used gastronomically in the Province of Alessandria.Rocca, Giuseppe et al.

As a post-conceptual artist, her statement has been since 2000 that Art is a multifaceted way of thinking, producing knowledge and experimenting that has a value far beyond the art domain. Her practice shows similarities with the emerging field of Critical Design and speculative design. These laboratories' output includes exhibitions, workshops, conferences, artist talks and publications and mixes artistic, academic and future insights. Her work is often financed by structures outside the art world such as a corporation who aims to benefit from the knowledge production mechanisms surrounding art as a force of creation and renewal.1\\\\.

The film was directed by Theodore Wharton and stars William F. Cody, Nelson Appleton Miles and Charles King, all of whom participated in the actual battles depicted in the movie. The feature was produced by the Buffalo Bill Historical Picture Company and Essanay Film Mfg. Company. The film was released in August 1914, but according to modern sources, it only played in Denver and New York City because of pressure from the government, which disapproved of its content because it showed the Indians in a somewhat favorable light. It is now considered a lost film. According to news sources from 1917, the original film was titled Wars of Civilization, but other alternate titles for the feature include: The Last Indian Battles, From the Warpath to the Peace Pipe, The Wars for Civilization in America, Buffalo Bill's Indian Wars and Indian War Pictures. Synopsis The film recreates four battles - the Battle of Summit Springs, the Battle of Warbonnet Creek, the Battle of the Mission and the Battle of Wounded Knee - which were fought by the United States Cavalry and various tribes of the Sioux Indians. The movie also features re-enactments of the Campaign of the Ghost Dance or Messiah Craze War, and the capture of Chief Big Foot. The feature also depicted Indian war dances, burning of camps and tepees, horse rustling and scalping. The end of the picture included scenes of Indian children attending modern schools and Indian farmers bringing in their crops. Cast *William F. Cody *Nelson Appleton Miles *Jesse M. Lee *Frank D. Baldwin *Marion P. Maus *Charles King *H. G. Sickles *Short Bull *Dewey Beard Production and background William F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) approached Secretary of War Lindley M. Garrison and Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane about making this film. Garrison supplied Cody with the necessary troops from the 12th U. S. Cavalry and Lane authorized the participation of over 1,000 Sioux Indians. Lieutenant General Nelson Appleton Miles was hired as a technical consultant to make sure that the re-enactments were as accurate as possible, and was a cast member as well. Colonel H. G. Sickles and Charles King recreated their parts in the original battles of Wounded Knee and Warbonnet Creek, respectively. The film was shot at the sites of the original battles between September 1913 and November 1913 in the Bad Lands of South Dakota and the Black Hills of Wyoming. On February 27, 1914, the film was screened for Secretary Lane and other members of Woodrow Wilson's cabinet. After Cody's death in 1917, footage from the film was used in The Adventures of Buffalo Bill, a tribute to the late Cody.

The museum's headquarters are located on Plaça del Rei, in the Barcelona Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic). It also manages several historic sites all around the city, most of them archaeological sites displaying remains of the ancient Roman city, called Barcino in Latin. Some others date to medieval times, including the Jewish quarter and the medieval royal palace called the Palau Reial Major. The rest are contemporary, among them old industrial buildings and sites related to Antoni Gaudí and the Spanish Civil War. The museum was inaugurated on 14 April 1943; its principal promoter and first director was the historian Agustí Duran i Sanpere. It belongs to the City Council of Barcelona, as part of the Culture Institute. History Remains of an ancient Roman salted fish and garum factory in the archaeological underground (MUHBA Plaça del Rei) Saint Agatha chapel (14th century) with its gothic altarpiece (15th century) MUHBA Plaça del Rei Since the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition there are recorded some attempts and projects in order to create a museum about the history of Barcelona. In 1929 during the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition the municipality organized a temporary exhibition about Barcelona's past, present and future that constitutes the forerunner of the Museum of the History of Barcelona, In 1931, Casa Padellàs, a late gothic palace (15th-16th centuries) was moved stone by stone from its original location on Mercaders street to Plaça del Rei, in order to preserve it and to avoid its demolition because of the opening of Via Laietana, an avenue created to connect the new Barcelona Eixample with the port, crossing the old city. While rebuilding Casa Padellàs on its new location, some remains of the ancient city of Barcino (Latin name of Barcelona) were found. Immediately, an archaeological research was undertaken in the surrounding area, emerging a whole quarter of the Roman city. Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) stopped all, though the importance of the findings determined that there was the most fitting location for the historical museum planned since the 19th century, that then would largely become an archaeological museum. The Museum of the History of Barcelona was finally inaugurated after the Spanish Civil War, in 1943, under francoist regime. The core of the museum was then centered on the archaeological remains of the Roman and late antique city together with the medieval royal palace in Plaça del Rei (Palau Reial Major), which includes the main hall called Saló del Tinell (14th century) and the palatine chapel dedicated to Saint Agatha (14th century) with its gothic altarpiece, a work of the medieval painter Jaume Huguet (15th century). In the rebuilt Casa Padellàs rooms were also exhibited objects witnessing the history of Barcelona along late medieval and modern times, until 20th-century beginnings: the city government and its regulations, the guilds, civic celebrations, wars and conflicts, crafts and trade, the International Expositions held in Barcelona and the growing and transformations of the city in the industrial era, among other topics. Gradually, the museum incorporated new sites like the Temple of Augustus or the Roman funeral way in Vila de Madrid square (found in 1954). The archaeological Plaça del Rei area also grew with new findings like the Early Christian baptistery (1968). At the end of francoism, when democracy was recovered in Spain (particularly since 1979), the role of the museum was reconsidered. The permanent, static, exhibition about the history of Barcelona in Casa Padellàs rooms was closed (around 1990). Thus, since 1996, Casa Padellàs rooms serve for temporary exhibitions that allow more dynamic overviews and crossed discussions about key subjects of Barcelona's history. Simultaneously, the archaeological area was completely remodelled and its museography updated, incorporating recent knowledge about the city in Roman and late antique times (inaugurated 1998). Along the last decades, MUHBA has also put the focus on contemporary history and has been growing as a network of heritage sites, tending to provide through them a more complete coverage over the History of Barcelona. Since 2005 MUHBA publishes the scientific magazine Quarhis (Quaderns d’Arqueologia i Història de la ciutat de Barcelona) as an updated resume of the former magazine Cuadernos de Arqueología e Historia de la Ciudad (1960-1980) Quarhis online MUHBA impulses a European network of city history museums and research centers on urban history (since 2010). Museum sites Roman funeral way in Vila de Madrid square MUHBA \\"El Call\\" (Jewish quarter) Air-raid shelter 307, built during Spanish Civil War Turó de la Rovira. Settlements of antiaircraft batteries The Museum of the History of Barcelona has several heritage sites spread all around the city. Most of them are archaeological sites displaying remains of the ancient Roman city, called Barcino. Others refer to medieval times and the rest cover the contemporary city, including old industrial buildings and sites related to Gaudí and the Spanish Civil War. *MUHBA Plaça del Rei.

At this time it occupied an area of and was stocked with 100 head of cattle. Yarrabubba was equipped with five windmills and 30 wells and divided into two paddocks. The Nairn brothers, pastoralists from Carnamah, purchased Yarrabubba in 1908. Sheep were being run at Yarrabubba in 1910 with the station producing wool for the London market. The station had an 8-stand shearing shed and during shearing in 1912 about 6,000 sheep were put over the boards. By 1915 an estimated 9,000 sheep were grazing at Yarrabubba, with the flock increasing to about 13,000 in 1916. In 1925 the Nairns acquired Leinster Downs Station in the northern Goldfields and stocked it with sheep from Yarrabubba.

Industry on the banks of the Contoocook River in Hillsborough began as early as 1763, when a sawmill and gristmill were operated in the area. More modern industrial activity began in 1828 with the construction of a cotton mill by Josiah Marcy. This three story timber frame building stands on the south side of Mill Street, on a granite foundation through which a raceway provide the water which powered the mill. Marcy expanded his operations, building a grist mill and saw mill before his death in 1848. The grist mmill, a handsome brick building on the north side of Mill Street, was operated as such until 1884, after which it was converted into the picker building for the main mill complex. The \\"main mill\\" stands prominently overlooking the falls. It consists of two buildings, possibly built at different times, that are connected. The western portion, nearest Bridge Street, is a timber-frame construction built in 1865 by John Butler Smith, who purchased the existing mill complex from Marcy's heirs. He also built the dye house and office, brick buildings located south and east of the main mill. Smith's business was eventually incorporated as the Contoocook Mills Company, giving the complex its name. The mills were the community's largest employer for many years, producing mainly woolen underwear. The mills had shut down by the early 1960s, and were rescued from demolition by local community efforts. Some of the buildings have been converted to residential use, while others remain in light industrial use. A portion of mill complex, consisting of five buildings between Mill Street and the river, was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

Montgomery and Stone became famous for their performance in the 1903 Broadway musical The Wizard of Oz, and had many other successes in musical comedy and vaudeville. Early years David Craig Montgomery was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, on 21 March 1870. In March 1887 he was given a juvenile role in Smokey Moke at a local variety beer hall called Streakbiner's Garden. He had been thinking of getting work with a railway, but now decided to go on the stage, and practiced a routine in his back yard. He learned to become a dancer and contortionist. He put on his song and dance routine at various minor local venues, getting a good reception. He played for some years in St. Joseph and Kansas City, then found work in Denver and the surrounding mining towns, where he first met Fred Stone. Stone (1873–1959) from Valmont, Colorado, was an acrobat and tightrope walker. While in Denver Montgomery was offered a job with the J. H. Haverly’s minstrel company, which was planning to first tour the southern USA and then move to New York. The minstrels played in Denver and then traveled to Texas where they played in Fort Worth and Dallas. They reached Galveston in January 1896 en route to New Orleans. Montgomery met Fred Stone again in Galveston, and invited him to become his partner. Billy Rice, manager of the minstrels. offered Stone a job, and he accepted. This was the start of a 22-year partnership. Travelling act In New Orleans, Montgomery and Stone played a song and dance routine, and Stone did an acrobatic act of his own. Attendance was poor, and after three days the Minstrels folded, unable to pay the cast. Montgomery was able to find a two-week engagement at a local variety theatre for himself and Stone, then got an offer from Billy Rice for them to appear in a minstrel show in Chicago at Hall's Casino. Montgomery had a good singing voice. In Chicago, Stone taught him new dance steps to use in their acrobatic tap dance routine. Montgomery and Stone were hired to perform in the Casino, Lyceum and Hopkins theaters in Chicago from March to June, and became well known for their original dance routine. 1897 poster for the Montgomery and Stone blackface minstrel act Montgomery and Stone signed up for the next season with Gus Hill's touring vaudeville company in May 1896. After spending the summer in Chicago the two took the train to Boston, where they opened in Gus Hill's Novelties on 19 September 1896 at Keith's Theater. The tour with Gus Fields took them to Newark, Washington, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Kansas City and to Chicago's Haymarket Theatre for Christmas. In Chicago they accepted an offer from Joe Weber to perform in the Russell Brothers show during the 1897-98 season. They continued with Hill's company, via Cleveland, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse to reach New York City at the beginning of February 1897. By this time their names were second on the posters after Gus Hill himself. Hill's tour continued, finally closing on 22 May 1897 in Cleveland. Montgomery spent the summer in New York and Stone with his family in Chicago, a pattern they would repeat for the length of their partnership. The Russell Brothers show opened on 2 October 1897 at the Olympic Theatre in Chicago. While still in blackface, Montgomery and Stone had a new comic song and dance act that had shed its minstrel origins. A review of the show said \\"Montgomery and Stone, in blackface, gave excellent imitations of real politicians, the hobby of the day, and by their singing and quaint expressions, as well as their startling moves, kept the audience laughing and applauding.\\" Montgomery and Stone at the Palace Theatre, London, in 1899 The show was unexpectedly forced to close in Cleveland in early February 1898. Montgomery and Stone were hired by Gustav Walter to play in his Orpheum Circuit theaters on west coast, starting in San Francisco on 5 March. This engagement ended when Walter died on 9 May 1898. The two were engaged in St. Louis, where they played at various venues for the summer. For the 1898-99 season they were engaged to tour with Hyde's Comedians. They left this company after a disagreement with another, similar act. They played in New York over Christmas 1898, and were offered a job for the fall of 1899 in the Palace Theatre, London, England. Montgomery and Stone returned to the West coast in January 1899, playing in California until April 1899, and had a series of theatre engagements in St. Louis, Chicago, New York and Buffalo before leaving for England. They opened in the 16th position on a vaudeville bill at the Palace Theatre on 21 October 1899. Their act was a great success. The engagement ended at the end of December, and they returned to New York in January 1900. For the rest of Spring 1900 the pair were much in demand, and played to theaters in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Albany. They were booked for the summer in Coney Island, and signed with the Johnstone Bennett vaudeville company for the 1900-01 season. Fame Fred Stone as the Scarecrow and David C. Montgomery as the Tin Woodman in the 1902 stage extravanganza The Wizard of Oz Montgomery and Stone received an offer to appear in A World of Novelties at Miner's Bowery Theatre. They first appeared on Broadway in 1901 in The Girl From Up There, at the old Herald Square Theatre. The critics identified them as the most significant players in this show. They went with the show to London in 1902. Vincent P. Bryan wrote most of Montgomery and Stone's comic songs. They performed the song Nautical Nonsense in The Girl From Up There.in 1901. This may be the same song as Hurrah for Baffin's Bay, one of the hits from The Wizard of Oz, with music by Theodore F. Morse and words by Vincent Bryan. Montgomery and Stone were hired to appear in The Wizard of Oz. They persuaded director Julian Mitchell to let them introduce their trademark physical humor. Montgomery played the Tin Man with creaky movements and a broad grin, while Stone played the loose-limbed Scarecrow. Their physical antics and comic duets made them both stars. The show ran in New York for nearly a year, then toured the USA with great success. They continued to play in The Wizard of Oz on tour and in return engagements through to 1905. Montgomery and Stone were co-stars of The Red Mill in 1906, an operetta written by Victor Herbert. They played the roles of Con Kidder and Kid Conner, two penniless American vaudevillians stranded at a small inn in Holland. The Red Mill opened in New York at the Knickerbocker Theatre on 24 September 1906. The Winthrop Moving Picture Company made very short films of two of Montgomery and Stone's routines from this show in May 1907. Montgomery and Stone often performed in vaudeville tours between Broadway engagements where they appeared in The Old Town (1909), The Lady of the Slipper (1912) and Chin-Chin (1914). Montgomery as Punks, Janis as Cinderella and Stone as Spooks in The Lady of the Slipper 1912 Victor Herbert’s musical play The Lady of the Slipper opened at the Globe Theatre, New York, on 28 October 1912. Elsie Janis played Cinderella, with Montgomery and Stone as Punks and Spooks. A reviewer said, \\"‘The names of David C. Montgomery and Fred A. Stone have been inseparably linked with fun and frolic ever since years ago they forsook vaudeville to enter the musical comedy field, and the same applies to Miss Janis, and in their present vehicle they live up to their reputations to the utmost degree.\\" Chin-Chin was the greatest hit of the 1914–15 Broadway season. It ran at the Globe Theatre from 20 October 1914 to 3 July 1915. The show is about painted dolls and tin soldiers in a Peking toy shop that come to life and meet Aladdin and his lamp. Both children and adults loved the show, which ran to packed audiences. David C. Montgomery died unexpectedly in Chicago, Illinois, on 20 April 1917. He was aged 47. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

It is a large five-story brick building occupying a corner lot on Manchester's principal commercial street. It was built in 1879 as a four-story building, and extensively rebuilt in 1908, when the fifth story was added. The first floor is lined by storefronts on both Elm and Amherst Streets. The second through fourth floors of the Elm Street facade are three bays wide, the bays divided by pilasters. Separate pilasters separate the bays on the top floor. The original second-floor windows were replaced in 1908 by large plate-glass windows. The third-floor windows have a segmented-arch top and the original 1879 window surrounds, although the windows themselves have been replaced by modern sash windows. The windows on the upper two floors are in rectangular openings with granite sills. The Amherst Street facade is also divided by pilasters and has similar window treatments, although a number of the second-floor windows have been partially bricked over. The building was constructed in 1879 for Thomas Dunlap, on the site of one of Manchester's first large commercial buildings, which dated to the early 19th century. It was designed by John H. Fanning, whose offices would occupy its third floor. Its fourth floor was originally occupied by the meeting hall of the International Order of Good Templars, a fraternal society. The building's 1908 alterations were designed by locally prominent architect Chase R. Whitcher, and notably introduced structural steel and styling derived from the increasing number of skyscrapers in major cities. Its elevator, also added in 1908, is a rare example of a retrofit; earlier elevators in Manchester were all designed into their buildings during construction. It was one of the most advanced office buildings of its time. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

The estate consists of a collection of five buildings, some of early-to-mid 19th century origin, either brought together or built by Wyman Kneeland Flint beginning in 1913. They represent the surviving elements of the village of North Antrim, much of which was destroyed by fire in 1888. Most of the estate is now owned by the Maharishi Academy of Total Knowledge. Description and history The Flint Estate is located in northern Antrim, on the north side of the North Branch River east of Stacy Hill Road. It includes his mansion, a c. 1817 brick structure that he had significantly enlarged in 1913-14. It also includes the c. 1820 North Branch Schoolhouse, acquired by Flint as a philanthropic gesture to help fund the construction of a new school, and since converted into a residence. The North Branch Chapel is a c. 1877 wooden structure, and the Sawyer House is a c. 1846 vernacular Greek Revival house. Flint used his property as a summer estate and a gentleman's farm. It later served as the campus of Nathaniel Hawthorne College, whose modern buildings were generally located west of the original buildings of the estate. When the area that is now Antrim was first settled in the 18th century, it had no clear village centers. The village of North Antrim arose around a small mill complex on the North Branch River, where a waterfall provided power for saw- and gristmills built in the 1770s. It was also located near the northern end of the main north-south road through the township. The Keene Road (whose modern alignment is New Hampshire Route 31) was built east-west through the village in 1834, originally running along the northern bank of the North Branch. The original Flint house was at the time of its original construction one of the largest and finest in the village. The bulk of the village, located on the south bank of the river, was destroyed in a major fire in 1888.

Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered the greatest damage, as the rain was the heaviest in 120 years of recorded weather measurements. By 20 May, at least 62 people had died as a result of the flooding, and hundreds of thousands had been forced from their homes. Towns of Obrenovac in Serbia and Doboj in Bosnia and Herzegovina account for most victims, after being inundated by several-meter high waters from nearby rivers. Floodwaters caused over 2,000 landslides across the Balkan region, spreading damage across many towns and villages. The rains activated torrents and mudslides, and subsequently several rivers in watersheds of Sava and Morava rose and flooded surrounding valleys. Official counts indicate that over 1.6 million people were affected in Serbia and Bosnia, after a week of flooding. Assessments of the damage range up to 3.5 billion € for Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina.Lisa Stadtherr et al.: Record Balkan floods of 2014 linked to planetary wave resonance. Science Advances 2, No. 2, 2016, Damage in Serbia, jointly estimated by EU, World Bank group and UN officials, stands at 1,55 billion euros. Officials in Bosnia stated that the damage could exceed that of the Bosnian War. The events initiated a large international aid campaign, with numerous countries, organizations and individuals donating humanitarian, material and monetary support for the affected areas. Meteorological history Total precipitation between 11 and 17 May On 13 May, a low-pressure area formed over the Adriatic Sea, as polar air from Central Europe penetrated into the Mediterranean basin. The cold polar air mass met with humid subtropical air, leading to very low pressure. On 14 May, the low moved over the Balkans, becoming stationary. As a result, extremely heavy rain fell within the region; Serbia (in the area around Belgrade) and Bosnia were most affected. Serbian and Bosnian meteorologists named the formed cyclone \\"Tamara\\". On 15 May, the daily amounts of rainfall broke historical records in Belgrade (107.9 mm), Valjevo (108.2 mm) and Loznica (110 mm). By 15 May, the monthly rainfall in Belgrade had broken the historical record (175 l from 1897), reaching 205 l. By Saturday, May 17, the rain had subsided, and the weather gradually became warmer and sunnier, somewhat easing relief and rescue efforts. On 18 May, the cyclone moved further northwest. Severe flooding in the Balkans seen by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite, 19 May 2014. The main flooding region was the watershed of the Sava river, which forms a border between Bosnia and Croatia, flows into Serbia, and drains into the Danube in Belgrade. On Wednesday, 14 May, heavy rainfall caused torrential floods across mountainous regions, which destroyed bridges and infrastructure, and caused numerous landslides. The deadliest impact occurred on Thursday, 15 May, when water levels in several right-bank tributaries of the Sava suddenly and uncontrollably rose at an unprecedented rate, flooding towns in their valleys. The Bosna river in central Bosnia completely flooded the cities of Doboj, Maglaj, Zavidovići and Šamac, while the Kolubara, near Belgrade, did the same to Obrenovac; those cities had the major share of victims. Subsequently, the Sava itself rose to record-high levels, threatening the cities of Slavonski Brod, Šabac and Sremska Mitrovica and numerous villages, but the damage was relatively contained as the population, helped by army and volunteers, strengthened flood defenses. Nonetheless, embankments gave way in several places. Heavy rainfall was also experienced in the region on 3 and 4 May, affecting Romania, Italy and Bosnia. The event produced limited damage but left a number of flooding incidents and high rivers. A state of emergency was declared in parts of Bosnia by local government. Hydrology Though heaviest affected areas were in the valleys of the Sava and Kolubara rivers, the center of the flood was the drainage basin of the Bosna river and its mouth into the Sava. Water in the Sava then broke through the newly constructed embankment on the left bank in Croatia and flooded the Lower Syrmia region. The water then uncontrollably rushed into the Bosut river which flows back into the Sava in Serbia. In Serbia, the heaviest floods were in the Kolubara river basin where the major rainfall caused extreme torrents in the mountains, causing the hydrological coincidence, a fact that high tidal waves appeared simultaneously on both the left and the right tributaries of the Kolubara. Rivers of Peštan and Vraničina also spilled over, flooding the surface mine \\"Tamnava-Zapadna Polje\\", within the Kolubara mines (see Lake Paljuvi). The flooded mines captured 200 million m3 of the flood water. Belgrade's Institute \\"Jaroslav Černi\\", funded by UNDP, compiled a study \\"Improvement of the water protection in the Kolubara drainage basin\\". Hydrological section of the report concludes that the cyclone caused the \\"continual rain of temperate intensity\\", which however lasted for too long (over three days). In May, the measured 48-hours rainfall was higher than the millennial rains in Loznica while the return period in Belgrade and Valjevo was 400 years. Return periods of the flow in the Kolubara was 120–520 and at the confluence into the Sava, when the Kolubara flooded Obrenovac and the mines, the discharge was . If the system against the floods was finished and functioning properly, and that mines and Obrenovac weren't flooded, the discharge would be . In the drainage basin of the Bosna river in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the rains in some places were exceeding the return period of 5,000 years (Vidmar A., et al., \\"The Bosna River floods in May 2014\\", Journal on Flood Risk, p. 1–25). At the same time, during the massive overspill in the basin, the return period of the maximal discharge (, 15 May 2014) was only 152 years and of the wave volume () was 189 years. After the reconstruction of the flood in the controlled environment, it was concluded that the discharge of the Bosna at Doboj would be on 16 May 2014. A discharge of the Sava, right after the mouth of the Bosna, at the Šamac bridge, was on 17 May (Abdulaj R., et al., ', , 207, 14–16, 2014). Downstream, in Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia, the discharge of the Sava was ('). If the entire flood control system in all three countries functioned, and that there were no overspills and floods, a hydrological coincidence of joining the highest Sava and Kolubara water levels would occur. That means that in Belgrade, downstream from the mouth of Kolubara into the Sava, the Sava would bring almost . The riparian zone along the Sava in Belgrade, called Savski Nasip and enhanced with the embankments, is deigned for receiving , so the city would probably suffer a major damage. Additionally, due to the illegal construction of the houses in the Savski Nasip area, the riparian zone is being destroyed and its volume is reduced. Affected regions thumb300pxAffected areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia: Serbia was the most severely affected, with several major cities in its central region completely flooded, and landslides in mountainous regions. Bosnia, in particular its Republika Srpska entity, was also inundated to a crippling extent. Eastern Croatia and southern Romania also experienced flooding and human victims, while Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Slovakia were affected by the storm. =Serbia= Obrenovac suffered the largest number of casualties and destruction during the flooding The city of Obrenovac was hit hardest by the floods, with an estimated 90% of the town flooded. During the night between 15 and 16 May, nearby Kolubara river, collecting waters from southerly mountains, suddenly rose several meters above its banks and flooded the city, catching the residents by surprise. The entire city was evacuated. During 18 May, the water level dropped, which enabled the evacuation of the citizens of Obrenovac to be carried out by trucks instead of boats. As of 20 May the total number of evacuated persons exceeded 30,000. Destruction of Krupanj by a flood In Krupanj in western Serbia (located in a valley of several small rivers) torrents, mudslides and landslides devastated the infrastructure and destroyed dozens of houses. Because of road damages, the town was completely inaccessible for three days, and the road to Loznica was blocked until 18 May. Electric power was cut for almost the whole municipality. Around 500 houses were seriously damaged and at least 20 houses are completely uninhabitable Part of the village of Rebelj in Valjevo municipality was annihilated by landslides. In the Drina river valley, on the border with Bosnia, heavy rain activated landslides, cutting off several villages and closing roads. At Mali Zvornik, a giant hill threatened to slide into the river and cut its flow, endangering that town and Zvornik across the river. Peak flood waters from Sava river hit Šabac on 18 May, but the embankments survived, strengthened by efforts of the army and several thousands volunteers. Flood waters on the river reached , the highest on record, endangering Šabac and Sremska Mitrovica on the left bank. In anticipation of the floods, a temporary embankment was erected. Further east, along the valleys of Morava and Mlava rivers, city centers of Paraćin, Petrovac na Mlavi, Svilajnac and Smederevska Palanka were flooded. During the flooding period, an estimated 300,000 households were left without electric power. Serbia's energy minister, Aleksandar Antić, has appealed to individuals to conserve power as best they can. The largest thermoelectric power plant in Serbia, TPP Nikola Tesla, which supplies close to 50% of electricity in Serbia, lies in the vicinity of Obrenovac, but was saved from danger. However, flood waters filled the largest coal field of RB Kolubara with 210 million cubic meters of water, more than the volume of Vlasina lake, and its pumping out is expected to take months. Further east, the thermoelectric power plant TPP Kostolac, which supplies 11% of electricity in Serbia, was threatened by floods from the Mlava river, but the water had not breached the innermost ring of defenses. During the floods, the hydro plants at Iron Gates reduced their production and opened the gates in order to lower the level of the Danube. During the floods, transport across the country, particularly central and western parts, was interrupted or broken. 2,260 public, industrial and infrastructure facilities were flooded, and 3,500 roads were destroyed. The Belgrade–Bar railway was severed at several locations in western Serbia, and has been closed; basic reparations took about a month to complete, and afterwards the trains were forced to take a several-hours detour. Reconstruction of the section in the Gradac river canyon was finished in March 2015, allowing the trains to return to the original route. Agricultural damage in affected areas was total, and the amount is yet to be determined. Thousands of cows, sheep, chicken and other domestic animals perished in the floods, and their corpses present a serious health risk for people who started returning and repairing their homes. On 20 May, the Government of Serbia proclaimed 3 days of mourning. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić described the flooding as \\"the worst natural catastrophe that has ever hit Serbia.\\" In a July 2014 report by the Government of Serbia, the total amount of damage in the country was estimated at 1.53 billion Euro. Of those, 810 million was attributed to direct damage, and 662 million to losses. Two thirds of the damage was attributed to the production sector (500 million direct and 569 million indirect), of which 228 million in the agricultural sector. Total damage on the housing was 227.3 million, while the infrastructure damage (transportation, communications and water management) was assessed at 192 million. =Bosnia and Herzegovina= Flooding in Zenica, 15 May 2014 Most of northern Bosnia was flooded, with the Bosna river valley hitting hardest. Other affected areas included the Sarajevo Canton and Tuzla Canton. Northern and northeastern Bosnia, including the region of Semberija, was also flooded. Rivers that flooded included the Bosna, Vrbas, Drina, Sana and Sava. A state of emergency was declared across the nation. Herzegovina in the south and central regions were not hit by floods. The town of Maglaj experienced the average rainfall of two months in under 48 hours. In the city of Zavidovići, a footbridge was filmed being swept down the Bosna river and crashing into another bridge. In Sarajevo, the Miljacka river swelled almost to the level of city bridges. The entire hamlet of Parići in Hrasno Donje, municipality of Kalesija, was swept away by landslides. As of 20 May, there were 24 confirmed deaths in Bosnia and Herzegovina: 17 in Republika Srpska and 7 in the Federation. At a press conference on 19 May, the Director of Police of Republika Srpska gave the names of 17 confirmed victims: 10 in Doboj, 2 in Šamac, 2 in Modriča and one each in Bijeljina, Vlasenica and Donji Žabar; an additional 7 persons are still listed as missing. Governments of the two entities jointly declared 20 May a day of mourning across the country. It was speculated that the floodwaters might have disturbed land mines left over from the Bosnian War (1992–95) which could cause further danger if moved outside the marked areas. The chief executive of Željeznice Republike Srpske, the railway operator in Republika Srpska (one of two railway operators in Bosnia) appealed for help in repairing the enormous damage to the railways in the country, stating that they were independently unable to repair the damage, appealing for help from the international community in supplying materials, mechanisation and financial assistance. =Croatia= Floods in Croatia; red dots indicate ruptured embankents Severe flooding in the Croatian locality of Gunja Croatia was affected by the floods to a lesser extent than Serbia or Bosnia.Floods have united the people of the Balkans  Andrej Nikolaidis  Opinion  The Guardian The most critical area was in southern Slavonia. The embankment on the Sava River was breached near Rajevo Selo and Račinovci, and thus evacuation was ordered for Gunja, Rajevo Selo and Račinovci. As of 19 May, around 15,000 people in easternmost parts of Croatia were evacuated from their homes. One of the most critical points was the embankment of the Sava river in Slavonski Šamac, where the confluence of the Bosna and Sava is located. At that point the embankments were under severe pressure caused by the huge amount of water coming from Bosnia. Several officials stated that if this embankment were breached, the entire region of southern Slavonia, with a population of over 300 000, would be flooded. There were also floods in Banovina region, in the towns of Hrvatska Kostajnica and Dvor, mostly caused by the river Una, whose level had not been as high since 1955. Video: http://vimeo.com/96164094 =Romania= This was the third major flood to hit Romania since late April 2014. Over 8,000 people were isolated and nearly 2,000 hectares of land were covered by water. 125 villages were affected by floods in one day. In total, 30 national and county roads were closed or partially destroyed by water and mud. The waters of the Danube rose so much that the authorities set orange code for flooding for eight days, on the sector Iron Gates–Zimnicea. In Vrancea County, a 50-year-old man was carried away by the flood and found dead the next morning. Bucharest was devastated by a storm accompanied by hail and strong winds. Several streets were flooded, trees were uprooted, and a thick layer of ice covered important transport arteries, paralyzing the traffic in the capital. =Slovakia= Floods and strong winds from the cyclone also reached Slovakia, where an elderly man drowned.

H. James Weale in London in 1904. William Henry James Weale (8 March 1832 – 26 April 1917) was a British art historian who lived and worked most of his life in Bruges and was one of the first to research the Early Netherlandish painting (then better known as \\"Flemish Primitives\\") extensively. He was also a pioneer in the study of early bookbinding, and a staunch promoter of Gothic Revival architecture. Biography Weale was born in Marylebone, London, in 1832 as the son of James Weale (died 1838) and Susan de Vezian (died 1855). His father was the librarian to John Baker Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield and had a large book collection of his own. Weale had two sisters Henrietta and the philanthropist Charlotte Julia Weale. Weale studied at King's College London between 1843 and 1848. He was the headmaster at a school in Islington. In 1854, he married Helena Amelia Walton, and the next year, after the death of his mother, they moved to Bruges. Weale was already interested in early Flemish art, and could pursue that interest much better in Flanders. He produced his first books on the topic in 1861. He was a member of the Belgian Royal Commission for Art and Architecture from 1860, and the Belgian Royal Commission for Monuments from 1861 on. In August 1863, in the wake of the first of the Malines Congresses, he founded the Guild of Saint Thomas and Saint Luke, an association to study and promote Christian art. Weale was a devout converted Roman Catholic and was inspired by Augustus Pugin and his 1841 work The true principles of pointed or Christian architecture. Besides Weale as secretary, other members of the initial guild included the first president, the Belgian Charles-Joseph Voisin, and as vice-presidents the Dutch Joseph Albert Alberdingk Thijm and the German Franz Johann Joseph Bock. In 1865 Weale founded together with Guido Gezelle the magazine Rond den Heerd. The same year he formed the Société Archéologique in Bruges. Other magazines he founded were Le Beffroi and La Flandre, and he also published in major art and literary magazines such as Athenaeum and the Gazette des Beaux-Arts. In 1864 he curated an exhibition on ecclesiastical art in Mechelen, and in 1867 he organised a first exhibition around the Flemish Primitives in Bruges, for which he also wrote the catalogues. In 1872, Weale catalogued the Flemish pottery at the Victoria and Albert Museum (then named the South Kensington Museum) where he became a curator in 1874. In 1879, he returned to England with his family and founded there the Guild of Saint Gregory and Saint Luke. He became the curator of the library of the South Kensington Museum in 1890, where he remained until his retirement in 1897. He started writing artist biographies, with one on Gerard David appearing in 1895, another about Hans Memling in 1901, and a final and most ambitious one on the Van Eyck brothers in 1908, with a revised edition in 1912. Meanwhile, in 1902, he organised the ambitious Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges, the largest exposition of works by Early Netherlandish painters up till then, which was groundbreaking and the source of many publications and research.

The pre-green is commonly mistaken for the fringe, which is the change in level from the green to the pre-green. Many courses don't make use of the pre-green, which means the fringe will connect the fairway and the green directly. The pre-green carries the same rules as the fairway, not the green. Golfers cannot mark or pickup their ball, but the flag may remain in the hole for their shot without incurring a penalty. In some cases, as with The Little 'B' Open in Spain, a player might be closer to the pin on the pre-green than a player actually on the green.

The Halloween solar storms were a series of solar flares and coronal mass ejections that occurred from mid-October to early November 2003, peaking around October 28–29. This series of storms generated the largest solar flare ever recorded by the GOES system, modeled as strong as X45 (initially estimated at X28 due to saturation of GOES' detectors). Satellite-based systems and communications were affected, aircraft were advised to avoid high altitudes near the polar regions, and a one-hour-long power outage occurred in Sweden as a result of the solar activity. Aurorae were observed at latitudes as far south as Texas and the Mediterranean countries of Europe. The SOHO satellite failed temporarily and the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) was damaged by the solar activity. Numerous other spacecraft were damaged or experienced downtime due to various issues. Some of them were intentionally put into safe mode in order to protect sensitive equipment. Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) had to stay inside the more shielded parts of the Russian Orbital Segment to protect themselves against the increased radiation levels. Both the Ulysses spacecraft which was near Jupiter at the time, and Cassini, approaching Saturn, were able to detect the emissions. In April 2004, Voyager 2 was also able to detect them as they reached the spacecraft. One of the solar storms was compared by some scientists in its intensity to the Carrington Event of 1859. These events occurred during solar cycle 23, approximately three years after its peak in 2000, which was marked by another occurrence of solar activity known as the Bastille Day Flare.

She was a leader in the scientific study of infant visual development. Personal life and education Davida Young Teller was born in Yonkers, New York on July 25, 1938, to David and Jean (Sturges) Young. Davida and her four siblings (Richard, Jean Poole, Daniel, and Samuel) spent their childhood years in Connecticut. Davida attended Swarthmore College on a fellowship. After graduation, she attended graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, receiving her PhD degree in the field of psychology, with Professor Tom Cornsweet as her dissertation advisor. She then completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Professor Horace Barlow at the University of California, Berkeley. Davida Young married David C. Teller (d. 2019), who received a PhD degree in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1965, and who subsequently became a faculty member in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Washington. The couple had two children: Stephen and Sara. Following a divorce, Davida married her second husband, Anthony W. Young (d. 2016), an oceanography technician and later, a customs clerk. Davida Teller died on October 11, 2011, in Seattle, Washington. Professional career =Academic appointment= In 1965, Davida Teller joined the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington as a Research Assistant Professor. In 1967, she received a joint appointment in the Department of Physiology/Biophysics. She remained a faculty member in both departments until 2004, when she retired and was granted Emerita status. Teller's talent as an educator was recognized formally when the graduate students in the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington established the Davida Teller Distinguished Faculty Award. This award is presented annually to a faculty member chosen by the graduate students. Professor Teller was the award's first recipient. =Research interests= Visual detection and discrimination Teller's initial research studies were focused on the spatial and temporal properties of a phenomenon first described by Professor Gerald Westheimer and sometimes referred to as the “Westheimer effect” or the “Westheimer function.” In this phenomenon, which Teller termed “spatial sensitization,” the detectability of a test light is first decreased and then increased by adding light to successively larger surrounding or annular regions. Westheimer proposed that the increase in detectability with surround illumination might represent the manifestation of lateral inhibition within the retina, and this possibility motivated Teller's interest in the phenomenon. Visual development In the early 1970s, following the birth of her children, Davida Teller began her studies of infant visual development that were to be the main topic of her research for the remainder of her career. In order to assess the visual capabilities of infants, she combined the visual preference technique of Robert L. Fantz with signal detection theory. The result was the forced-choice preferential looking (FPL) procedure. In this approach, an observer who is masked as to the location of a visual target has to judge the location of the target based on the direction of an infant’s gaze. Some characteristic of the target, such as its size, color, or speed of movement, is varied across trials. A psychometric function is then derived in which the observer's percent correct value is plotted as a function of target attribute. The level of target attribute that corresponds to a criterion percent correct value is used as the measure of the sensory threshold. The FPL technique, which has also been applied to infant monkeys, has produced a wealth of information about normal and abnormal visual development. However, an unresolved issue is the extent to which the FPL technique (or any psychophysical technique, for that matter) measures the best possible visual capacity of an infant, animal, or patient. Interest in a clinical application of the FPL procedure led Teller and her colleagues to develop the Teller Acuity Cards, which are now used in eye clinics around the world to measure the visual acuity of infants and young children as well as of non-verbal older individuals. On one side of each card is a pattern of black and white stripes (square wave grating). The remainder of the card consists of a uniform gray matched to the average light level of the stripes. Each card contains a different stripe width. The tester observes the infant through a peephole in the center of the card and attempts to determine the side that contains the stripes, based on the infant's looking behavior. The smallest stripe width that elicits a reliable judgment of stripe location by the observer provides a measure of the visual acuity of the infant or young child. Linking propositions A major theme underlying Davida Teller's research was the nature of the relationship between visual phenomena and their neural underpinnings. This interest stemmed in part from G. S. Brindley's discussion of what he termed \\"psychophysical linking hypotheses.\\" Her interest was also stimulated by the ideas of her postdoctoral mentor, Professor Barlow, about the \\"neuron doctrine,\\" which explored the \\"relationship between the firing of single neurons in sensory pathways and subjectively experienced sensations.\\" Teller formalized her thinking on this topic in publications that described “linking propositions,” i.e. assumptions about the relationship between perceptual and physiological states. In her article \\"Linking Propositions,\\" Teller (1984) severely criticized the casual use of such assumptions, discussing logical problems including lack of face validity. She concludes that: \\"..visual scientists often introduce unacknowledged, non-rigorous steps into their arguments...It would seem useful...to encourage visual scientists to make linking propositions explicit, so that linking propositions can be subjected to the requirements of consistency and the risks of falsification appropriate to the evaluation of all scientific propositions.\\" Surprisingly, perhaps, many, if not all, of the propositions flagged by Teller continue to form the basis of data interpretation in psychophysics today. An interest in linking propositions can be seen in Teller's early work on spatial sensitization, which was thought to represent the action of lateral inhibition, and it remained a theme of her research on infant vision, in which she sought to define the constraints imposed on infant visual performance by the developing central nervous system. Advocacy for women in science Beginning with her graduate student years in Berkeley, California, Davida Teller was a strong supporter of, and model for, the role of women in science and academia. Teller's long-standing advocacy for women in science was recognized formally following her death by the establishment of the Davida Teller Award of the Vision Sciences Society. This award is presented annually to a woman who has made exceptional contributions to the field of vision science and who has a strong history of mentoring. Recognition Scientific awards * Glenn A.

History Crozier was born in Roxburgh, Scotland, and in 1838 emigrated in the Coromandel to New South Wales, where he had been appointed to manage the estate of Redesdale, in the Braidwood district, owned by Dr. Anderson, of Parramatta, and which was principally worked by assigned convicts. For three years he managed the Redesdale property, then from 1841 he managed the Sandhills station, not far from Bungendore and Lake George, in the Bathurst district for Captain Dobson, R.N. While there, he worked closely with John Henry Challis (died 29 February 1880), a member of the firm of Flower, Salting, & Co., who managed Captain Dobson's commercial interests in Sydney, and who bequeathed £100,000 to the Sydney University. After five years at the Sandhills, he took up a station on the Edward River with partner George Rutherford; then moved to the Wentworth district, where they established Kulnine station. After some years of this pioneering work, Crozier became the sole proprietor of Kulnine, and eventually prospered sufficiently to acquire Moorna and other stations on the opposite side of the Murray. Eventually he sold Kulnine station and half the stock to Mr. Bagot, and as years went on he purchased runs in the north and on the Queensland and New South Wales borders, placing his sons in charge of these properties. In 1866 he moved to Adelaide, and in August that year purchased Oaklands estate, near Brighton, from Samuel R. Kearne (c. 1829–1921) and John H. Kearne (1830–1890), whose father Samuel Kearne (c. 1892–1857) had established the farm and 24-room residence. The estate included land which became the modern suburbs of Oaklands Park and Warradale. In 1867 Crozier stood for a seat in the Legislative Council, which at that time was elected by the colony treated as one large constituency \\"The Province\\", one third falling vacant every four years. Three seats had become vacant through death or resignation, and Crozier was returned at the head of the poll, with (later Sir) William Morgan and Emanuel Solomon the other successful candidates. In 1877 six elected members were returned: William Morgan, John Crozier, Richard Chaffey Baker, Thomas English, James Pearce and Henry Kent Hughes. For the 1885 election the colony was divided into four districts for the Legislative Council, and Crozier and Henry Scott were returned for the Central district; Crozier died two years later. He was also for many years chairman of the Brighton District Council, and took a considerable interest in the wine industry, and produced a large quantity while he was at Oaklands. He also took an interest in horse breeding, and imported some high-priced animals from Tasmania. He was in 1875 a founding steward of today's South Australian Jockey Club, along with Sir John Morphett, Sir Henry Ayers and others. Family He married Jessie Taylor (1819 – 3 January 1877). Their children included: *William Crozier (1839 – 22 June 1906) purchased Moorna station and Tilcha stations, and Kulnine from his brother John. He inherited the Oaklands estate from his father. He married Esther Murray (1848– ), a sister of sheep breeders Alick and John J. Murray. He was judged to be a lunatic by the South Australian Equity Court, and placed in confinement. His valuable estates were entrusted to the management of James Angus Johnston. *John Crozier, jr. (1843 – 6 July 1916) was a noted racehorse breeder. He inherited Kulnine station from his father and sold it to his brother William. He then purchased St. Albans Stud from James Wilson, sen. and sold that establishment a few years later to mining magnate W. R. Wilson (no relation) at a substantial profit. *Elizabeth Lilian Crozier (1845 – April 1936) married John Richardson (c. 1846 – 10 September 1917) on 7 December 1866. She moved to Perugia,Italy with her daughters, Mrs. Percy Frost and Mrs. T. F. Wigley. She died in London. *Walter Taylor \\"Wattie\\" Crozier (c. 1848 – 6 June 1931) married Elizabeth Ann Hancock; owned a third share of Bimbowrie station with brothers Arthur and Edwin. He appears to have lived and died unheralded. His wife made claims on her father-in-law's estate together with Elizabeth Richardson; perhaps indicating she and Walter were separated. *Thomas (1850 – c. 25 August 1878) died of heart attack at Cuthero on the River Darling *Elliot Crozier (1852? 1854? – 10 November 1941) lived at \\"Kongal\\", Bordertown, married \\"Lottie\\" Trew (1868 – 28 April 1938) on 7 December 1887. Their eldest daughter, Jessie Martyn Crozier (died 18 August 1931) married Hurtle Augustus Pegler. Another daughter, Cowra Crozier, married Ben Chaffey. *Arthur Crozier (1856 – 13 September 1929), pastoralist, inherited Kulnine station from his father and purchased Moorara and Cuthero stations from his brother-in-law Ben Chaffey. He married Annie (c. 1867 – 20 July 1938); their children included Gordon, Llndsay, Keith, Kenneth, Malcolm, Neil, Marjorie (Mrs Ron Cameron) and Jean. *Edwin Crozier (c. 1859 – 21 November 1906) was born at Kulnine and educated at Frederick Caterer's Glenelg Grammar School. He married Ethel Trew on 21 February 1898. His father gave him, with brothers Arthur and Walter, Bimbowrie station, which was where he died in agony after accidentally setting fire to his clothing. *George Taylor Crozier (1861 – 27 August 1929) was a noted horseman, sheep breeder and sporting shooter. He married Amie Maud Southee of Balranald and died at Kirkee Private Hospital in Mildura.

It was founded in 1954 and today covers 2,212 hectares. Tea is grown on 730 hectares of land, including 20 hectares of herbal plants and 401 hectares of organic tea plantation. Today the estate produces an average of over two million kilograms of bag grade black tea per year and is one of the only steady sources of income for local residents who are capable of picking up to 80 kilograms of wet tea leaf per day.  History  The vast majority of the worlds tea (with the exception of China) was originality planted by Dutch and British colonists, Tanzania is the only country in which tea was first planted by Germans. German control of the country lasted from the 1800s until 1919 when under the League of Nations, it became a British mandate until independence in 1961. Many of the German settlers decided to stay on under British governance and eventually one settler decided to build a large tea garden and factory in the vicinity of the Usambara mountains. Due to the rich soil found in this district and the remarkable success of tea growing other planters, including Luponde, moved in and gradually the number of plantations increased. From the very beginning the Luponde Tea Estate proved that it was more than capable of producing extremely high quality teas and in recent years has earned a fair trade certification and has established an excellent track record of beneficial social and economic developments for its workers. Recent developments have included the estate using some of its Fair Trade premiums to commission the construction of a Maize grinding mill. The construction of this mill enabled estate workers to take their own crops, grown on land provided by the estate, to have it ground close to home rather than walking for over 7 kilometres, as they previously had to do.  Certifications  The Luponde Tea Estate has been Rainforest Alliance certified since 2012 and has been Fair Trade certified since 1994.  Environmental practices  The Luponde Tea Estate has built up an excellent reputation for good environmental practices which include all natural methods of tea husbandry as opposed to chemical fertilizers and other synthetic agricultural inputs.  Luponde Tea  The creation of the Luponde TeaLuxury Organic Tea  About Us  Luponde Tea business in the UK was conceived after its founders, Guy and Tamsin Lafferty visited the Luponde Tea Estate. After sampling the \\"exquisite taste\\" and realising that the product was largely unknown outside of the general tea industry, the couple made it their own personal mission to bring this product to the rest of the world. Following the creation of the business and subsequent store openings the team have gone on to aid the Luponde Tea Estate and the surrounding areas through local environmental investment. Projects include the planting of over 30,000 trees on disused areas which works towards balancing the company use of paper and gift wrapping card.

The JIE will combine DoD’s many networks into a common and shared global network. It will provide email, Internet access, common software applications, and cloud computing. The main objectives are to increase operational efficiency, enhance network security and save money by reducing infrastructure and staffing. According to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), the JIE will encompass all DOD networks and will enhance network security by: * Using a single-security architecture; * Minimizing network hardware, software and staffing; * Giving DOD users access to the network from anywhere in the world; * Focusing on protecting data; and * Improving DOD’s ability to share information among the services and with government agencies and industry partners. In execution, there are three lines of operation: governance, operations, and technical synchronization. DISA has been given responsibility for the technical aspects of JIE and leads the JIE Technical Synchronization Office (JTSO), which includes agency staff, as well as representation from the military services, intelligence community, and National Guard. The organization evolving the JIE includes the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO), DoD CIO, Joint Staff J6, United States Cyber Command, military services, intelligence community, and National Guard. The JCS chairman and each of the service chiefs have endorsed JIE as a military imperative. The Deputy Management Action Group, a part of DCMO that considers department-wide management and business issues, has endorsed the JIE’s viability to efficiently address budget issues, the threat vector, and the need to be dominant in the information operations. The JIE will allow warfighters to work jointly and collaboratively in a secure information sharing environment. Its architecture provides a key benefit to connect military networks out to the very tactical edge, something current Defense Department systems cannot do. Another advantage is to break up current military unique service-oriented computing environments, allowing software based capabilities and tools to be deployed across the entire Defense Department enterprise.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. The company operates under a number of brands in the United Kingdom, Ireland and mainland Europe. These include Currys, PC World, Team Knowhow and Carphone Warehouse in the United Kingdom; Dixons Travel in airports in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Oslo; Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse in the Republic of Ireland; Elkjøp in Norway; Elgiganten/Gigantti in the other Nordic countries; and Kotsovolos in Greece. History Following shareholder agreement in July 2014, the £3.8 billion merged entity was launched on 7 August 2014; on the first day of trading the shares in the merged business were owned 50:50 by the former Dixons Retail and former Carphone Warehouse shareholders. Carphone Warehouse's Sir Charles Dunstone was appointed chairman, and Sebastian James became Chief Executive. On the first day of trading, the company opened Carphone Warehouse concessions in seven PC World or Currys stores. In December 2016, Dixons and SSE, a domestic energy supplier, announced a partnership to provide \\"connected home\\" services in the United Kingdom. In January 2018, Sebastian James resigned as Chief Executive to become President and Managing Director of Boots UK. Alex Baldock left his previous role as Chief Executive of Shop Direct (the company responsible for brands such as Very and Littlewoods) to succeed James as Chief Executive of Dixons Carphone. In March 2019, Dixons Carphone was given a £29.1m fine from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for misselling its service of Geek Squad. The FCA found that the company's staff were trained to sell the service to customers who already had an insurance cover. During the period under investigation, between 1 December 2008 and 30 June 2015, Carphone Warehouse sold Geek Squad policies worth more than £444.7m. Dixons Carphone did not contest the FCA's findings and qualified for a 30% discount, reducing the fine from £41.6m. In June 2019, shares in Dixons Carphone fell almost 20% following a significant decline in full year profits, mainly caused by consumers' growing delay in upgrading their mobile phones. On 3 April 2020, the company permanently closed 531 standalone Carphone Warehouse stores that were solely focused on telephone devices. Subsequently, 3,000 job positions related to the affected stores were cut. According to the firm, the reason behind the closure of the stores was the online shift of customers and a lesser extent of phone upgrades. Carphone Warehouse shops continue providing telephone services. Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 4 August 2020, Dixons Carphone announced additional 800 job cuts in order to reduce the costs caused by the pandemic. The company also announced its plans to re-organise its operations in their bigger stores. Regarding the decision, the firm's chief operating officer stated that they wanted \\"to empower store leadership teams, create a flatter management structure and make it easy for customers to shop with us.\\" Operations The company owns the following brands: =United Kingdom and Ireland= * Carphone Warehouse – mobile phone retailer * Currys – specialises in home electronics and household appliances * PC World – specialises in computing; increasingly combined with Currys in dual branded stores * Team Knowhow (rebranded from Knowhow in July 2017) – a provider of after sales product support and cover; provides home delivery, installations and repairs * Dixons Travel – a retailer operating in the main airports in the United Kingdom, Dublin Airport in Ireland, and on board P&O;'s cruise ship Ventura * iD Mobile – a 4G mobile network operator (United Kingdom) =Northern Europe= *Elgiganten – (\\"Electrical Giant\\") sells home electronics and household appliances in Denmark and Sweden *Elkjøp – (\\"Electrical Buy\\") sells home electronics and household appliances in Norway *Gigantti – (\\"Giant\\") sells home electronics and household appliances in Finland *Dixons Travel – operating in Oslo Airport The KnowHow brand is also present in the Nordic stores. =Southern Europe= *Kotsovolos – sells home electronics and household appliances in Greece Data security breaches The group was fined £400,000 by the Information Commissioner in January 2018, as a result of unauthorised access to the personal data of over three million customers in 2015. A further security breach, said to affect 1.2 million customers, was reported by the company in June 2018. The number of customers affected was later increased to 10 million.  Tech support  In May 2020, Dixons Carphone has offered free phones, networking and a dedicated phone line enabling services, to help hundreds of elderly citizens, who feel trapped and alone through the pandemic.

The hotel is located on the corner of Hay Street and Milligan Street.Melbourne Hotel The reference incorrectly refers to Melbourne Road. Melbourne St was renamed in 1923 to become part of Milligan St, but as shown on an 1860 map, Melbourne St itself never adjoined the corner of Hay and Milligan Sts. History In the 1890s, in the wake of the Western Australian gold rush, American-born mining investor and hotelier John De Baun (1852-1912) moved to Perth with the intent of investing in real estate. The reference incorrectly refers to Melbourne Road. Melbourne St was renamed in 1923 to become part of Milligan St, but as shown on an 1860 map, Melbourne St itself never adjoined the corner of Hay and Milligan Sts. In 1896, he purchased the Eagle Tavern on the corner of Hay Street and Milligan Street from the Swan Brewery Company, and demolished it. De Braun engaged Fremantle- based architect Peter John Wilson (1869-1918) to design a new hotel to replace it. The building is designed in the Federation Free Classical style, and named after the nearby Melbourne Street. The hotel officially opened in April 1897, serving both boarders and visitors to the city during the gold rush. On 20 September 1898 Grace Lannin, the licensee of the hotel, was the first person charged for selling liquor after 11pm without a permit; she was fined 20 shillings. Although it was still being used as a hotel until the 1970s, it also served as a pub for the most part of the twentieth century. In 1970 John Murdoch and Robert Stowe acquired the property, they then transferred the title to a syndicate of West Australians (including Len Buckeridge), trading as Melbourne Hotel Pty Ltd. Buckeridge's company, L. W. Buckeridge and Associates, drew up the plans for the first major work undertaken on the hotel. These works involved extensive additions to the west side of the hotel and internal renovations. In the 1970s, the ground and first floors were used as a nightclub and cabaret lounge. Later, in the 1980s and 1990s, they were known as Tiffany's Nightclub, The Firm Nightclub, The Pink Galah Cabaret, Middleways Piano Bar, and Meccanos. The Melbourne Hotel on Milligan Street. In 1993 the building was purchased by Decanning Ltd, who renovated it for the use as a private business club, The Old Melbourne Club. The company engaged the architectural firm of Oldham Boas Ednie-Brown to undertake the renovations, which included a western extension of the Hay Street frontage to match the existing structure. The renovations occurred from 1994 to 1995, and included the restoration of the cantilevered balcony, together with the grand timber staircase and decorative ceilings to their original splendour. In 2006, Singaporean-company Oakesfield Pty Ltd took ownership of the Melbourne Hotel. The Buchan Group architectural firm undertook renovations of the building from 2015-2018, which included demolition of the 1990s additions to the building and their replacement with a seven-storey structure that wrapped around the building. The $40 million redevelopment included 73 guest rooms, function rooms and five food and drink venues. The front bar was reopened as De Baun & Co in honour of the original building owner John De Baun. Architectural character It is a three-storey brick building with a pitched corrugated iron roof concealed behind an elaborate parapet. The facade has a painted stucco finish, round-headed timber windows and door openings arched with false stonework, attached columns, pilasters, triangular pediments and projecting mouldings, all in Federation Free Classical style. It features an elegant first floor balcony, cantilevered out over the pavement on both street frontages, supported on cast iron decorative brackets, cast iron columns and lacework with a bullnosed corrugated iron roof. The interior features include timber floor and roof construction, plastered wall finishes, timber joinery and mouldings, and decorative plaster ceilings, a decorative timber staircase, a metal lift car with leadlight doors and some leaded glass in fanlights to windows in the Hay Street facade. Heritage value The Melbourne Hotel was entered onto the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission on 1 November 1988. On 21 January 1997 it was placed on the permanent State Heritage Register. It was included on the City of Perth's Municipal Heritage Inventory on 13 March 2001. Additionally, it was classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA) on 7 December 1987.

Initially published in 1884, it was her second novel and is considered her breakthrough work. Because of its highly erotic content, it was the subject of legal controversy and general scandal, bringing Rachilde into the public eye.Holmes, D. (2001) Rachilde: Decadence, gender and the woman writer, Oxford and New York: Berg, p. 171.Hawthorne, Melanie C. and Liz Constable (2004) Monsieur Vénus: roman matérialiste, New York: Modern Language Association of America, p. xiv The novel tells the story of French noblewoman Raoule de Vénérande and her pursuit of sexual pleasure while creating a new and more satisfying identity for herself. In order to escape the ennui and malaise of her tradition-bound upper class existence, she must subvert and transcend social class, gender roles, and sexual morality.  History of the Work  Rachilde was often flexible with biographical information; her account of writing Monsieur Vénus is no exception. According to Maurice Barrès, she wrote the book when she was still a virgin, not yet twenty years old (that is, before 1880). Rachilde variously reported writing it while in hysterical paralysis after the poet Catulle Mendès rejected her amorous overtures; writing it as catharsis for memories of her mother's abuse of her father; and writing it simply to create a scandal and make a name for herself. Whatever the circumstances in which it was written, the book was first released in 1884 by Belgian publisher Auguste Brancart with the dedication, \\"We dedicate this book to physical beauty,\\" and a warning that any woman might secretly harbor the same desires as the depraved heroine of Monsieur Vénus. As was common at the time, the novel was serialized prior to its publication in one volume. The first edition was attributed to Rachilde and a co-author credited as \\"F. T.\\", supposedly a young man named Francis Talman who appears to have written nothing else before or since. It has been suggested that \\"Talman\\" was created to take the blame for the obscenity of the novel, much as Rachilde had once tried to convince her parents that earlier obscene content in her work was the fault of a Swedish ghost, \\"Rachilde.\\" Three printings of the first edition were issued. The second and third printings were based on a revised first edition that changed the front matter and removed some content from the novel itself. Although not much was taken out in terms of overall word count, the effect of the changes was to soften some of the obscenity and may have represented an unsuccessful attempt at forestalling legal prosecution. The first French edition was published in 1889. Editor Felix Brossier opened the book by asserting that Rachilde was the sole author of Monsieur Vénus, explaining that some material from an unnamed collaborator had been removed. (In addition to maintaining the earlier revisions, further passages were cut, described by Rachilde as Talman's contributions.) Brossier went on to say that this edited version of the novel was literature, and had nothing in common with the sort of erotica that was \\"published and sold clandestinely.\\" Maurice Barrès also lent credibililty to the publication with a lengthy preface in which he praised the author and prepared readers for what they were about to experience. The effect was to help legitimize the book for a French public both curious and apprehensive about this banned Belgian novel. This 1889 edition of the book was dedicated by Rachilde to Léo d'Orfer (née Marius Pouget), a former lover. It was the basis for all subsequent editions and translations until the original first edition text was recovered for Monsieur Vénus: roman matérialiste (2004).Hawthorne, Melanie C. and Liz Constable (2004) Monsieur Vénus: roman matérialiste, New York: Modern Language Association of America, p. xli Main characters The following is a brief list of some of the characters most important to the story. * Raoule de Vénérande, a noble woman and artist, disaffected with her life and trying to create a more satisfying identity for herself. * Jacques Silvert, a poor florist, the object of Raoule's desires and manipulations. * Marie Silvert, the sister of Jacques and a prostitute, the feminine opposite of Raoule. * Baron de Raittolbe, a suitor of Raoule and a soldier, the masculine opposite of Jacques. * Ermengarde (1st Edition) / Elizabeth (French Edition), Raoule's Aunt, the voice of the conservative cultural establishment. Plot summary Noblewoman Raoule de Vénérande becomes bored with her life and her usual suitors. She begins a relationship with an underprivileged florist named Jacques Silvert, paying him for his favors. Through a process of escalating humiliation, she transforms her lover from a weakly androgynous figure into a feminized one. One of Raoule's suitors is Baron de Raittolbe, an ex-hussar officer. Raoule further flouts the rules of her social class by rejecting Raittolbe and marrying Silvert, sometimes referred to as her husband but positioned more as her wife. When a furious de Raittolbe beats Silvert, Raoule begins to abuse her spouse even more flagrantly. The spurned de Raittolbe takes to enjoying the companionship of Marie, Silvert's sister, who is a prostitute. Silvert soon begins trying to seduce de Raittolbe himself. Jealous and frustrated that her project to create a perfect lover has failed, Raoule provokes de Raittolbe into responding by challenging Silvert to a duel. Most of their acqaintances do not understand why the duel is taking place, nor how Raoule encouraged its escalation from \\"to the blood\\" to \\"to the death.\\" De Raittolbe wins the duel, killing Silvert. Raoule does not grieve in the expected way. Not long after, she creates a wax dummy version of Silvert with real hair, teeth, and fingernails from a corpse (presumably Silvert's). In the closing passage of the novel, Raoule puts the grisly mannequin in a shrine and gazes upon it nightly, dressed in mourning clothes, sometimes as a woman and sometimes as a man. Each night she embraces the dummy and kisses its lips, which are mechanically animated to kiss her back.Holmes, D. (2001) Rachilde: Decadence, gender and the woman writer, Oxford and New York: Berg, pp. 3, 117, 120.  Major Themes  The title of the book predicts some of its themes. While \\"Venus\\" establishes its erotic tone, the combination of the masculine \\"Monsieur\\" with the name of the female goddess suggests the gender subversion that dominates the story. The title also recalls the use in eighteenth century anatomy classes of wax female dummies called anatomical Venuses, anticipating the novel's ending. One major theme dominates all the others of the novel. Raoule is not looking for escape. She is not ultimately looking for sexual pleasure. She is not even looking to \\"discover\\" herself. Instead, her quest is to create a new identity, better and more satisfying than the dreary and oppressive social role into which she was born. = Social Class = It is no accident that bored and stifled Raoule de Vénérande is a member of the upper class, which represented the height of banal conformity for decadent writers. The hysteria that appears to drive her is the perfect excuse for her to escape the constraining traditions of her social class. Not only does she have an affair with a lower class man, she pays him for his favors, making him not her mistress but her gigolo. When she marries him, she is not only marrying outside her class, but is in effect marrying a prostitute. Importantly, Raoule does not subvert her social class in the modern way. She follows the model set forth by the decadents: not forsaking her wealth and privilege, but using them to her advantage and in defiance of the traditions that gave her that position in the first place. She does not pursue freedom as a starving artist; she claims freedom by transforming herself into a dandy. = Gender Roles = The subversion of gender roles in Monsieur Vénus is twofold. First, there is the basic gender role reversal that can be observed in the power dynamics of the relationship between Raoule and Silvert. Beyond the act of cross-dressing, Raoule takes on traditionally masculine roles: she pursues the object of her desire and commands the obedience of her lover. She is also his abuser, and a better abuser than the man who had first beaten her lover, essentially asserting herself as a masculine figure. Similarly, in the end, she turns de Raittolbe into her hired assassin, once again proving herself the better man. Second, there is a deeper exploration of gender identity. Raoule sees Silvert as an androgynous figure with some feminine characteristics which she then amplifies. In one sense, through her merciless abuse, she helps him find a more secure gender identity for himself. At times he calls himself \\"Marie,\\" his sister's name. By the same process, Raoule subverts her own gender; at one point Silvert begs her to just be a man. At the conclusion of the novel, Raoule appears to have no single gender identity, sometimes appearing as feminine and at other times as masculine. = Sexuality = Her contemporary and friend Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly once remarked of Rachilde, \\"A pornographer, yes, she is, but such a distinguished one!\\" Raoule does not feminize Jacques because she is attracted to women. She has no interest in Marie and she denies being a lesbian to de Raittolbe. She feminizes Jacques because she is using sexuality as an escape from ennui and a tool for shaping her identity. In pursuit of those goals, she explores and takes pleasure in cross-dressing, humiliation, sadomasochism and something that falls somewhere between Pygmalionism and necrophilia. = Illusion and the Impossible Ideal = Throughout the novel Raoule demonstrates a willingness to push things further and further in pursuit of an ideal experience that she realizes is impossible. In the end, she turns to illusion and artifice and the force of her own will, since reality fails to comply with her wishes. In this, she is joined by others in the Decadent Movement. In his Against Nature, Joris-Karl Huysmans suggested that human creations are more beautiful than natural ones, and also that the line between dream and waking reality depends simply on an act of human will. Later, the Czech decadent Arthur Breisky would assert the priority of beautiful illusion over reality. That is the context in which Rachilde's Raoule completes her transformation of Silvert by supplanting him with something of her own making, based on him, but improved through her creativity.  Controversy and Changes  The Belgian authorities were aggressive in pursuing legal action against Monsieur Vénus. A trial was held on charges of pornography. The author of the book was found guilty in absentia; the court ordered fines and two years of prison time. Belgian officials confiscated and destroyed every copy of the book they could find. While there is little question that the book qualified as obscene under existing statutes, Brancart the publisher was already on their radar for a number of reasons, a situation that likely contributed to the speed and thoroughness of their response. For her part, Rachilde simply avoided returning to Belgium and thereby escaped her sentence. French authorities began to monitor her, however, so Brancart hid most of her personal copies of the book, though no further legal action was taken against her. The revised first edition may have been an attempt to forestall what happened in Belgium, but it is believed that books from all three of the Brancart printings were destroyed. Nevertheless, the changes did soften certain kinds of obscenity. The revisions removed a description of Raoule experiencing an orgasm as she daydreamed about Silvert (Chapter 2) and abbreviated the moment of implied necrophilia. In the original, after describing how Raoule would kiss the mannequin and its mechanisms would allow it to kiss her back, the text continued by saying it also opened its thighs (\\"en meme temps quil fait s'ecarter les cuisses\\"). When the 1889 French edition was put together, the rest of the so-called Talman material was removed, primarily the original Chapter 7. The focus of that chapter was very specifically on gender and the struggle for authority between the two sexes. The excised chapter describes Raoule as establishing the formula by which women could destroy men: using sexual pleasure to control them and rob them of their masculinity. It is worth noting that, contrary to some reports, that chapter was still present in the 1885 Brancart printing of the revised first edition and so was not subject to the original Belgian censorship of the novel. It was not removed until the Brossiers edition published in 1889, the year Rachilde married Alfred Vallette, who had always hated that material. In fact, the message of that chapter may have been reinforced in the 1885 printing by the quotation chosen for its cover: \\"To almost be a woman is a good way to defeat a woman.\\" The quotation is from Catulle Mendès's \\"Mademoiselle Zuleika,\\" which describes a man's realization that the only way to resist a woman's natural authority through her sexual appeal was to become more feminine himself in his flirtations and his vanity. Another alteration between the 1885 printing and the 1889 French edition concerns the name of Raoule's aunt, which was changed from Ermengarde to Elizabeth.  Reception and Influence  Beyond the legal problems in Belgium, the initial reception seems to have been a mixture of titillation at the erotic content, fascination with the scandal, and amusement at the fact that this darkly sexual fantasy was from the mind of a young woman who was only twenty-four years old at the time of initial publication and reportedly not yet twenty when she wrote it. Even among Rachilde's friends and supporters, there was a struggle to offer praise without either a wink or a snicker. Monsieur Vénus was the occasion for Paul Verlaine's remark to Rachilde, \\"Ah! My dear child, if you've invented an extra vice, you'll be a benefactor of humanity!\\" In his preface to the 1889 Brossiers edition, Maurice Barrès described Monsieur Vénus as depraved, perverse, and nasty. He referred to it as a \\"sensual and mystical frenzy\\" and the appalling but exciting dream of a young virgin who suffered from the same hysteria as her main character. Even so, it was certainly Monsieur Vénus and its attendant scandal that consolidated Rachilde's position in the Parisian literary scene. Even a winking connection between Monsieur Vénus and the work of Charles Baudelaire was enough at the time to give Rachilde credibility within avant-garde circles. Oscar Wilde read the book while staying in France in 1889. Not only was he a fan, it is believed he drew inspiration from the novel for his own work, paying it tribute by naming the book that ensnares Dorian Gray Le Secret de Raoul. Monsier Vénus is also credited with paving the way for other, less extreme, and ultimately more successful writers such as Colette to explore gender and the complexities of sexuality in their own work.

At the time of her death in 2014 she continued to receive letters from people saying how much she inspired them to cycle; her record still stood until 2015. Cycling record She had taken up cycling around the age of 18 and, following the ideas of the Women’s League of Health and Beauty, she rode across the United Kingdom on a mission to promote the health benefits of cycling. She gained sponsorship from Rudge- Whitworth to provide a bicycle and financial support so that she could ride every day of the year in a wide variety of weather conditions. She was also sponsored by Cadbury chocolate. She was self-reliant on her journeys, cycling alone and calling in at cafes to eat. She did not carry any water. The distances were authenticated through a cyclometer on the bicycle and cycling check cards signed by witnesses that she submitted to the Cycling Magazine (now Cycling Weekly) offices. Her cycling record bid started 1 January 1938 from Mill Hill in London. The summer weather was good, but December 1938 was snowy. The distance she travelled each day averaged , but was up to in summer. Her mammoth tour included many evening engagements requiring her to give a talk at the end of a long day's pedalling. Fleming's ride attracted a huge amount of interest and press attention as the year progressed. Her record attempt finished with a reception at the Agricultural/Horticultural Hall in London that included cycling journalists and Mr England. Her mileage set a women's record and attracted international attention. Her subsequent plan to cycle across the USA had to be called off because of the Second World War. She also later met René Menzies and Tommy Godwin, who successively held the men's record for greatest distance cycled in a year, among other achievements. In 1940 she broke three records riding a tricycle — the 25-, 50-, and 100-mile distances. Personal life She was born Lilian Irene Bartram on 13 April 1914 in Camden, north London. Her father was a toolmaker. She attended the Lyulph Stanley Central School, Camden and left aged 16 to become a typist and secretary. During the Second World War she worked in the buying office of an aircraft company. Her first marriage to Freddie Dovey ended in divorce, with one son. She subsequently married George Fleming (d. 1997) after the Second World War, a cyclist with a huge racing pedigree who had a number of cycling records. She had a stepson from his previous relationship. In later life she lived in Devon. She died at the age of 100 years on 12 May 2014 after a short illness. Legacy and similar record attempts by other women In 1942 Pat Hawkins set out to take the record from Fleming but her total mileage of 54,402.8 miles was disallowed after a review of her log books by the Australian cycling authorities. The Billie Fleming Tribute Cycle Ride in 2015 aimed to recreate Fleming's ride over 2015, with different women riders each day. By the end of the year 400 riders had covered 107,000 miles. Kajsa Tylen was inspired by Fleming, and started to cycle on New Year's Day 2016, aiming to cover at per day. She said that she wanted to motivate people to exercise rather than raise money for charity. Tylen broke her record. American Amanda Coker began a UMCA certified attempt to surpass Fleming's record on 15 May 2016. On 21 September 2016, after only 130 days into her attempt, Coker passed Fleming's record. Coker then went on to set the Guinness overall record (male or female) on 15 May 2017 when she finished with 86,573.2 miles (139,326.34 km).

Hirabai first met Aurangzeb in 1653 and became a favourite concubine of his. Her sweet voice and unparalleled beauty charmed Aurangzeb to a very great extent. Hirabai died less than a year after she met Aurangzeb probably in 1654 which ended their short affair. Life with Aurangzeb During his vice royalty of the Deccan, the Prince paid a visit to his aunt at Burhanpur. Mir Khalil, (successively surnamed Muftakhar Khan, Sipahdar Khan, and Khan-i-Zaman), a son-in-law of Asaf Khan, was sent to the Deccan as Chief of the Artillery in the 23rd year of Shah Jahan, 1649—50. In 1653, he became commandant of Dharur. It was only in Aurangzeb's reign that he became subahdar of Khandesh. Zainabadi, who was beloved by Aurangzeb before his accession, had been, it is said, in the Khan's harem as his concubine. One day the prince went with the ladies of his harem to the garden of Zainabad Burhanpur, named Ahu-khanah [Deer Park] and began to stroll with his chosen beloved ones. Zainabadi, whose musical skill ravished the senses, and who was unique in blandishments, having come in the train of Khan-i-Zaman's wife (the prince's maternal aunt), on seeing a fruit-laden mango-tree, in mirth and amorous play advanced, leaped up and plucked a fruit, without paying due respect to the prince's presence. This move of hers robbed the prince of his senses and self-control. With shameful importunity he procured her from his aunt's house, and became infatuated and given up to her, in spite of all his severe continence and temperance and pure training in theology. The story goes that one day she offered him a cup of wine and requested him to drink it. All his professions of reluctance and entreaty were disregarded. Then the poor prince was (at last) about to drink it, when that sly enchantress snatched away the cup (from his hand) and said \\"My purpose was to test your love and not to embitter your mouth with this wicked and unlucky liquor!\\" This love-affair proceeded to such lengths as to reach Shah Jahan's ears. Dara Shikoh, who loved not Aurangzeb, made capital of this incident to slander his brother to the Emperor, saying, \\"See the piety and abstinence of this hypocritical knave! He has gone to the dogs for the sake of a wench of his aunt's household.\\" By chance the rose of her life withered in its very spring time, and left the prince seared with the brand of eternal separation. She is buried at Aurangabad close to the big tank. On the day of her death the prince became very unwell; in extreme agitation he rode out to hunt.Love- affair with Zainabadi References External links *Aurangzeb the love less Mughal Emperor *History's Most Hated Mughal Emperor *Qissa e Laila Majnu...

It was developed by the marketing and communications firm Select Holding Ltd, together with the China Tourism Academy (CTA), board of the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA). Company's purpose is to help Chinese tourists to feel more comfortable, travel easier and feel welcome overseas. Another goal is to help global hotels/resorts, museums, amusement parks, transportation hubs and all other sightseeing and tourist destinations to reach China's market through promotional activities. History The original purpose of Jacopo Sertoli, Select Holding’s CEO, when opening the China office in 2010 was to export to China the business model of Select Italy, a US-based tour operator focused on high-end tourism to Italy. Because of this experience, Welcome Chinese was able to start its activities with a background in international tourism. Nevertheless, encouraging Chinese people to travel to Italy proved to be a formidable task. To improve the involvement of tourism businesses in Western countries, the company started by promoting the broadcasting of CCTV News, the bilingual channel of the Chinese State television, CCTV, as an in-room amenity in hotels. Although it started out as a secondary business, it lit the first spark for the Welcome Chinese concept: to certify hotels and other tourism businesses in return for providing services tailored specifically to Chinese tastes and habits. A new marketing strategy was being developed at that time, with single hotel chains like Preferred,Preferred Hotel Group launches ‘China Ready’ program, Travel World News Hilton,Hilton Hotels & Resorts announces global program for Chinese travelers, Hilton media center Marriott,Welcome to Li Yu, Marriott Accor,Accor's Chinese optimum service standards, Accor Starwood,Welcoming Chinese guests around the world, Starwood and InterContinentalHualuxe hotels and resorts, InterContinental independently starting their own programs to cater to Chinese visitors. These programs range from guaranteeing Mandarin-speaking staff at the hotel and providing Chinese- style breakfasts to accepting UnionPay credit cards.Welcome, in Mandarin, New York Times It was the signing of the partnership between Select Holding and CTA, in the middle of 2013, that established the necessary basis for the constitution of Welcome Chinese. As it officially states, CTA aims to establish itself as think tank specialized in promoting the development of China's tourism industry.About CTA It provided an influential endorsement, thanks to its position as a specialized institute directly under CNTA. CTA agreed to promote the Welcome Chinese project and to privilege participants who have implemented the standard by recommending them to the Chinese travel industry.CTA Official Authorization The launch The official launch of Welcome Chinese took place on October 18, 2013 at the National Stadium in Beijing.The first officially recognized China's outbound tourism project, Travel China This followed the additional support that Select Holding gained from state-owned companies like China Central Television (CCTV) and China UnionPay. An agreement with Hilton Worldwide was then secured so that the hotels within its Huanying program could be involved in the Welcome Chinese program.Welcome Chinese grand launch, Welcome Chinese News This same period also saw the founding of Welcome Chinese Ltd, based in Hong Kong, while the operational activities were kept in the Select Holding’s offices in Shanghai. The Welcome Chinese Certification (WCC), as introduced during the event in Beijing, was a program for which non-Chinese hotels can apply.The Welcome Chinese Certification launched as China’s first abroad tourism service standard, China Tourism At that time, the Certification was divided into three levels – Bronze, Silver and Gold – according to the quality and number of services that tourism businesses can guarantee to Chinese guests. First business plans for the medium term, with the aim of developing and adapting the standard towards restaurants, airports, museums and shops were considered shortly afterwards. Together with the brand, the B2B and B2C Welcome Chinese website was also launched in Beijing. Before going under total renovation, it listed all the certified hotels in order to provide accurate and up-to-date information for the Chinese traveler. The B2C section allowed travelers to search for accommodations outside China, filtering the results by services – the so-called “Welcome Chinese services” – as well as by price and location. Starting from 2014, the Project was introduced to customers and travel agents during various tourism fairs in China. Among them, CMT,\\"Welcome to China\\": Let Chinese tourists feel at home in overseas hotels, China Daily COTTM, WTF,World Travel Fair introduces new destinations, CCTV English BITE, CITIE and WTM in London.WTM 2014 Exhibitors list, World Travel Market official website Roadshows aimed at get in touch with local tour operators were held in 2nd- tier cities such as Wuhan, Xi'an, Kunming, Chengdu and Chongqing.

The initiative includes a conference as well as business workshops that bring European tourism suppliers and Chinese tour operators together, first for two days in Shanghai in conjunction with ITB China fair, and later in the fall of 2017, doing a similar round of events on European soil.World Bridge Tourism - the first step towards 2018 EU-China Tourism Year, Bulletin of the European Travel Commission, Winter 2016-17 The Welcome Chinese Certification The two levels of the Welcome Chinese Certification consist of a progression of required services aimed at Chinese guests.

It borders the municipalities of Peñaflor de Hornija, Villanubla, Ciguñuela, Valladolid (for an enclave of the municipality), Castrodeza and Torrelobatón. St. Mary's Church Another view of St. Mary's Church Ossuary with skeletons from the 13th to 18th century The settlement is located on the Camino de Santiago de Madrid, one of the variants of the Way of St James. Notably Wamba is the only municipality in Spain whose name contains the letter w. Toponymy Its name comes from the Gothic King Wamba, who was elected king in that city in the year 672. At that time it was called Gérticos and King Recceswinth had a villa there resting. As Receswinth died in this town, the nobles elected Wamba immediately that day. Monuments =St Mary's Church= The existence of a Visigothic church at Wamba is known: remains of its decoration are preserved in the Archaeological Museum of Valladolid. It seems likely that during the repopulation of this area after the reconquest, a then existing church from the time of Receswinth was rebuilt. The resulting building was perhaps the first Mozarabic church in the area. It has been suggested that Wamba was repopulated by people coming from the north and that for this reason St Mary's architecture is much closer to Visigothic and Asturian influences than is the contemporary church at San Cebrián de Mazote, which was repopulated by Christians who came from Al-Andalus. From the Mozarabic church only the East End is preserved, the first installment of the naves and the entire north wall, while the rest was replaced and expanded in the late twelfth century, when Santa María de Wamba became dependent on the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem . Its shape was that of a rectangle 18m long by 12m wide, divided into nine areas with horseshoe arches on pillars, to which a header, the same width as the rest of the church, is joined consisting of three rectangular apses with the central apse protruding. Unlike the plan of San Cebrian, Mazote, the inner shape of the three apses is rectangular. In the part of the church rebuilt by the Knights Hospitaller in the twelfth century, Cistercian style, we can also consider a compartment attached to the north transept, of uncertain date, covered by vaults with central column, several paintings and sculptures from different periods and an ossuary in the even that retain some of the thousands of skeletons deposited along the thirteenth to eighteenth centuries. In the church of Santa Maria was buried the Queen Urraca of Portugal, wife of King Ferdinand II of León and mother of King Alfonso IX of León. After her marriage was annulled, she was a nun in the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. In the call Chapel Queen is placed an epitaph, after the death of Queen Urraca of Portugal , which is related to that queen, daughter of Afonso I of Portugal and his wife Matilda of Savoy, Queen of Portugal, was buried in this church. It has a huge ossuary over 3000 skulls of monks. On one wall, one can read the following epitaph: \\"As you see, I saw myself as you see me, you see all ends here Think about it and you will not sin....\\" Gallery of the ossuary Image:Fundación Joaquín Díaz - Iglesia de Santa María.

He is commemorated as a saint by the Syriac Orthodox Church. Biography Severus was a monk at the monastery of Asphulos near Reshʿayna, and later became the archbishop of Amida. He succeeded Theodore as patriarch of Antioch in 667/668 (AG 979), and was consecrated by John Bar ‘Ebrayta, archbishop of Tarsus. 667/668 (AG 979) is given as the year of Severus' consecration by Bar Hebraeus in his Ecclesiastical History, whilst Michael the Syrian gives 666/667 (AG 978), and the Chronicle of 819, the Chronicle of 846, and the Zuqnin Chronicle place it in 664/665 (AG 976). In Severus' tenure as patriarch, he attempted to centralise authority in the church by removing the right of the archbishops to ordain suffragan bishops. A number of bishops opposed Severus' challenge to the archbishops' rights, and united under the leadership of Sergius Zkhunoyo, bishop of Germanicia, Ananias of Qartmin, archbishop of Damascus, and Gabriel, bishop of Reshʿayna, and asserted that this right had been established by the fourth canon of the Council of Nicaea in 325, whereas Severus argued this right had been abolished by the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Severus convened a synod at Beth Tellat to settle the dispute in 679/680, but was preempted by his opponents, who declared his deposition as patriarch of Antioch and excommunicated him, to which he responded by excommunicating them also. The schism endured for four years until Severus, on his deathbed, wrote to John, archbishop of the monastery of Saint Matthew, to authorise him and the bishops Joseph and Sergius to restore communion to his opponents on the condition that they repented and renounced their actions against him. Severus subsequently died in 684 (AG 995), according to Michael the Syrian. Other sources date Severus' death differently, as the Chronicle of 846 and the Zuqnin Chronicle place Severus' death in 682/683 (AG 994), and Bar Hebraeus gives 679/680 (AG 991). Works Severus is known to have written a number of propitiatory prayers (pl. ).

Life Born in Colchester, Smith went to London about 1818, and spent a short time training as an architect. Coming of age in 1821, he inherited some money, and bought a part-proprietorship in a newspaper, The Sunday Monitor, on which Douglas Jerrold worked as a compositor. By the time he was 24 he found himself penniless. William Harvey then instructed him in wood-engraving. Orrin Smith had previously been a pupil of Samuel Williams. In 1842 Smith took into partnership William James Linton. Smith & Linton did much work for the Illustrated London News, and illustrated books, including Whist, its History and Practice, from designs by Kenny Meadows (1843). Smith died of apoplexy on 15 October 1843, at 11 Mabledon Place, Burton Crescent, London. Works The Ponte della Maddalena, illustration from The Solace of Song by John Orrin Smith After much hack-work, Smith was employed by Léon Curmer of Paris to engrave a number of the woodblocks for his edition of Paul et Virginie (1835). In 1837 he prepared prints for John Antes Latrobe's The Solace of Song (Seeley & Burnside), a new departure in wood-engraving with a finish contrasting with the crisp work of Luke Clennell, Charlton Nesbit, and John Thompson. His contribution to the technique of wood-engraving was admired by contemporary commentators including one, writing in the London and Westminster Review in 1838, that Orrin Smith was an \\"able and intelligent cultivator of his art, and has introduced improvements and attempted effects ... which have advanced it.\\"Henry Cole, 'Modern Wood Engraving', London and Westminster Review, July 1838, pp. 145-52 (151).

It was originally published by Beacon Press, in Boston MA, United States, in 1998. The piece is both memoir and cookbook. Short essays precede recipes written in personal vernacular, and these recipes cover locations such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the United States.  Synopsis  =Chapter 1= The book begins with a discussion of celebrations and the food that accompanies them, mentioning Frederick Douglass's lack of enthusiasm for the celebration of the Fourth of July, and asking why \\"would they want to celebrate the American Declaration of Liberation while the Fugitive Slave Act, which allowed the kidnapping of free slaves back to slave states on the word of any white man, was in effect?\\" It details a winter during which Shange, determined to give her daughter a traditional Owens/Wilsons holiday, searches Clinton - Washington for ingredients. She looks for ways to recreate the traditional flavors, for she \\"tried to make again my very colored childhood and my very 'black' adolescence.\\" In this first chapter, Shange expresses feeling a connection to her ancestors through the re-creation of pig's feet, chitlins' Hoppin’ John, baked ham, collard greens and cornbread with syrup despite experiencing the holiday in a friends home and eating alone. =Chapter 2= Chapter 2 takes the reader to St. Louis and Shange uses the experience of listening to a short wave radio emanating the sounds of Fidel Castro as a child to talk about her experiences in Cuba as an adult. She says that her child was one of Cuba's Young Pioneers and shared food, recipes and traditions with children from a multitude of other locations, such as Zimbabwe and Palestine. While in Cuba, the author experiences a blackface performance, which she is horrified by. She eats avocado with beer and reminds herself that \\"history, our history, mustn't scare me.\\" Cuba's slave trade history is discussed, and Shange is concerned with \\"How'd all these hardworking - cutting cane is torturous labor - Africans get fed and what'd they eat?\\" =Chapter 3= In Chapter 3, Shange is in Nicaragua. She describes it as the \\"little country with the black people on one side of the mountain and the mestizoes and blancos on the other, while the Amerindians made a way for themselves in the jungles as best they could.\\" She shows the East and West coast as being uncommunicative and disconnected and the area she is familiar with being left with no infrastructure, which she describes as detrimental to the community. Shange's journey to the house of the esteemed poet Rubén Darío leads her to participate in a bus ride during the entire bus singing along to Usted Abuso, by Shange's favorite salsa singer. This makes her feel at home. Shange runs into Carlos Johnson and partakes in the experience of a dance hall. saying \\"we connect to the culture of the people we live with\\", =Chapter 4= Shange is in Brixton, a working- class West Indian neighborhood and she describes shopping in the area with her daughter, as they look for food items. Savannah and Shange prepare for her friend Leila's birthday dinner, and each of the ingredients used is described. At the end of the chapter, she mentions the fact that Leila's partner Darcus Howe is from Trinidad and Tobago, and makes a reference to the presence of slavery in East India. She ends with the quote: \\"Now we are independent. We own the soil. We have our own name. We have our own flag. Let us have some wine and some music.\\" =Chapter 5= In Chapter 5, Shange is in the world of the Caribbean, and looking at the \\"matter of the flyin' fish\\" in Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. Here, she describes the different ways in which two communities looked at one commodity. The Trinidad and Tobago fishermen were catching the flyin fish that were essential to the Barbadian diet, and didn’t eat it. While the Barbadians argued that it was wrong for them to catch the fish that they didn’t even eat and then sell it back as a profit, they said that they were only supplying the demand. She then says that who knows what would happen if the Barbadians came after shark meat, which is treasured by the Trinidadians. =Chapter 6= Chapter 6 is about Brazil. Shange talks about the different colors of the populations of different sections of Brazil, saying that the south is industrialized and \\"mythologically white\\", while it's thought that the \\"Africans\\" live in the north. She talks about how when she was at a university in Bahia she asked each student to bring in the beginning of a performance piece or something based either off their lives or the world as they knew it. Each student talked about a myth, which she found disturbing and says that \\"My students were validating themselves as the 'other' where they were not the other.\\" Shange says that \\"We are not folklore.\\" In terms of Brazil, she says that \\"the epitome and apex of Brazilian life may be the continually multiplying mulatta, but we must all eat whatever our hue, or the hue and cry over who we are.\\" She then goes about looking at what makes up the primary dishes, focusing on Brazilian rice. Shange makes the point that Brazil has the highest percentage of people of African descent who live outside continent and that \\"We eat what they eat, just differently. These recipes have stayed with us for centuries, being improvised here and there, where we found somethin' we were accustomed to in, say, Guinea was not available at the mouth of the Amazon.\\" =Chapter 7= In Chapter 7, Shange talks about the Juba, \\"a dance of coutrin'\\", that is found in the Caribbean and the community of slaves in North America. Chapter 7 briefly discusses dance in slave culture and says that \\"it's time to tend to our own gardens. Let's grow some sweet potatoes to keep the niggah alive.\\" It mentions the crops that were carried into the new world, and talks about Carolina rice, which Shange was raised on. It talks about different preparations of rice, and Shange relates style of cooking to location. She chides her mother for thinking that spice and a burnt bottom are ruining the rice, when rice with a crusty bottom is common in the Caribbean. Shange then goes back to dance, talking about classes taken at the Clark Center. =Chapter 8= Chapter 8 talks about the assimilation of people to western territories and how old dishes are adapted to new locations, as well as the lack of knowledge newly arrived slaves had about the treatment of Native Americans. It talks about the ramifications of the Dred Scott decision. Oklahoma is mentioned as \\"our nearest place of safety\\", and A. G. Belton is mentioned as an entrepreneur who wrote to the American Colonization Society about the problems of post slavery communities. She questions the Buffalo Soldiers' treatment of the Native Americans and the way that \\"we changed, made necessary readjustments to our gods and belief systems to accommodate the Christianity thrust upon us as our salvation.\\" (p. 54). She also discusses debate around bones of freemen that were found along Vine Street Expressway in Philadelphia. She says that bones have to be moved to make room for other things and that it was acceptable for the removed bones to be moved because they belonged to what were considered a \\"lower species of man\\". This leads to a part about the treatment of deceased African - Americans and what happens to their remains. Shange says that the world of slavery and the European took \\"what the world was to us out of our control?\\" =Chapter 9= Chapter 9 looks at African Americans in Texas. She says that slaves in Texas weren't immediately informed that they were free until General Order number three was issued. African American Texans created their own independence day (Juneteenth) and she asserts that they found ways of finding community. She describes arenas commanded by African American cowboys who were continuing tradition, as well as her own participation. She says that rodeos were another venue for food, with women producing barbecue; she provides a recipe for Texan beef barbecue. She tells a story about convincing her father to come see her race barrels in Hitchcock, Texas, and about the barbecue they had. She details her father's reaction the barbecue and sauce, and his comparison of it to his own barbecue. Shange makes mention of the fact that \\"I was raised to experiment with taste and sound, thus my interest in music, language, and food, but more importantly to never turn my nose or chin up to any kinda food that anybody ate.\\" =Chapter 10= Chapter 10 begins with a mention of Elijah Muhammad's column \\"How to Eat to Live\\". Shange talks about Frank Yerby's play Foxes of Harrow and looks at his characters \\"defiant and self - determining\\" and at Yerby as someone who actively rejected Southern antebellum life, without denying its existence. From there, Shange looks at refusing food as \\"one of many methods Africans used to maintain some dignity, some control of their lives\\". She discusses the relationship between crackheads, dope fiends and slavery and writes that \\"Cooking is a way of insisting on living,\\" and saying that \\"When we are hungry for life, we search out spice, aromas, and texture to entice and please those around us.\\" She uses gumbo as an example here and references the cities of Charleston and New Orleans. She discusses different ways to make roux and then the way to add okra to gumbo, yet says that her own immediate family does not like okra. =Chapter 11= Chapter 11 looks at boys. Shange says that from the first, she was expected to serve boys food, and that this was part of a dating ritual \\"to prove I was of value, valued my visitors and our time together so much that I made a hands-on effort to create something for whoever this person was\\". She discusses her adolescent reaction to it and her later realization that was being taught an important \\"Southern/African tradition of sharing the best I had with visitors\\". (p. 80). She describes the link between cooking and self value, as well as the energy and importance of time in the kitchen. She mentions that music can assist the kitchen process. =Chapter 12= Chapter 12 looks at the need \\"to re-create a 'where' for our people\\". It looks at people who do not commit to the American way of life. Shange talks about meeting a Rastafarian in Cancun, Mexico, and the ways in which African culture was destabilized during slavery. She uses the limitation of diet as an example. Yvette, a friend, is used as an example; she explains that her vegetarianism is an alternative choice to the meat and dairy diet suggested by America. In this chapter, Shange looks at the idea that African Americans are a \\"people in transition\\" describes the first bembe she ever attended and talks about African-American Jews. =Epilogue= The epilogue contains references to Shange's dance experience and talks about sugar, giving people something to make them happy, and providing dessert recipes.  Analysis  The author herself once described this difficult to define project as one of \\"writing some thoughts about food\\", It allows the author to see herself both within the tradition she is exploring as an individual, and is a tribute to black cuisine as a food that reflects the spirit and history of a people. Shange actually moved her bedroom into the kitchen while writing the book. She looks at food as something that celebrates the history, migration and soul of a people. Here, food provides the backdrop and basis for questions of identity that involve origin, relocation and what ultimately has the power to bring people together. The essays before each recipe endow them with historical, emotional, and communal importance. The small essays allow her to \\"understand or recognize herself in the history and culture of other African - origin people of the world... travels to Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or places undeniably products of the African Diaspora launch Shange's thoughts on being and identity.\\" Shange puts extreme value on food, evident in an interview with The Sun, in which she says that \\"I believe you should eat and prepare food with the same care you treat a newborn infant\\", if i can cook / you know god can explores history, and the ways in which food and culture are intertwined. Different people, cultures and locations come together in the food put on the table, and the recipes that the food comes from. By writing about the food culture she comes from, Shange asserts the importance of the food she details and provides recipes for, the food that is important to her people. She claims this food culture, and history, as important, worthy of recognition, remembrance, and immortality in writing. Shange refuses to let this history be ignored. As stated by Mosaic Literary Magazine: \\"This is not a cookbook, it's a food lesson, a means by which the African diasporic existence is ultimately justified.\\" Shange sees connection between food and history, and has said that \\"I also wanted to write about {blacks'} relationship to food as a people in bondage and how that changed.\\" In this work, Shange actively addresses the past, and \\"goes well beyond mere listings of ingredients to show how various foods reflect the black experience from the slave ships to the present\\". For example, Shange introduces the readers to \\"Afro-Atlantic foodways\\", which is a type of food that came to being on slave ships. This piece discusses the importance of location in relation to food. Eating brings people together. Shange displays the ways in which recipes are adapted according to location. When people move, they bring a food history with them, and yet it evolves according to the availability of ingredients, culture, traditions and influence of present location. Therefore, recipes are spread to different locations, evolving and yet simultaneously staying true to tradition. In a review in The Booklist by Alice Joyce, she says that Shange \\"paints a fervent, richly impassioned chronicle of African-American experience, at the same time making note of political situations and discord among the peoples of these nations and recording how connections are made beyond issues of class or skin color. Recipes serve as savory, nourishing garnishes\\" Shange displays the ways in which certain recipes and traditions have survived over time, allowing people to remember and recall Africa, even when in a different place. Food is a way for \\"black folks in the Western Hemisphere to be full\\". For example, Shange \\"identifies the African-American migration west after the Civil War and how the voyage was fueled by the hunting and farming skills folks learned during slavery. She makes these connections from a fundamental love for and admiration of the development of African contributions to the new world order\\". Shange claims that by continuing, but adapting, past food culture to location, African Americans declare the presence and importance of their culture in a new location, such as the United States. She is asking the questions \\"Where did black folks end up? How did they cope with relocation?\\" and realizing that the answer is \\"at the table, where hearts, minds, and bellies come together and are made full\\". Shange looks at food as a feature of memory as well, for not only is the memory of history bestowed upon food but food, as a product of a long and rich culture, can trigger memory. When Shange spends New Years with her daughter in New York, she has an \\"insatiable desire to recreate for her daughter the family holidays she remembered\\". This work is a tribute to the universality and individuality of food, for it connects an entire group of people and yet can remain a specific, unique experience. As said in The Austin Chronicle, \\"it's clear in her book that Shange takes a great deal of pleasure in the preparation, presentation, and savoring of well- prepared food\\". Shange writes her recipes with a specific reader in mind, one who will understand the references she makes and who has a prior knowledge of the foods she discusses. Shange reclaims the food history of her people, while dispelling stereotypes and misconceptions through an identification of facts, experiences, and feelings both cultural, historical, and social. Food ties people together, and Shange makes the point that \\"Our food isn't reflective of our lack of culture, it is, in fact, the very opposite - it's the foundation from which we grow and continue to thrive.\\"  Style/Tone  The recipes and essays are written informally in a personable tone of an experienced person conveying exactly how to recreate a recipe. The recipes make allowances for individual preference and skill level, while at the same time making basic assumptions about the reader's knowledge base. Shange writes in \\"trademark lilting vernacular\\" The voice of a piece is extremely important, for Shange said in an interview with Neal A. Lester in 1990 that \\"I'm a firm believer that language and how we use language determines how we act, and how we act then determines our lives and other people's lives.\\"  References  Category:Cookbooks Category:Works by Ntozake Shange Category:Literature by African-American women ","title":"If i can cook / you know god can"},{"id":"42765361","text":"Kandibagh is a village in Chaparhar District, Nangarhar province, Afghanistan.

She was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate from Oregon in the 2014 election against Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley. Early life and education Wehby was born in Nashville, Tennessee. Her father was a Certified Public Accountant, and her mother was a registered nurse. Her grandfather immigrated from Lebanon. Raised a Catholic, she graduated from Father Ryan High School in 1979 and went on to earn a BS in Microbiology and a BA in Psychology from the University of Notre Dame. Wehby graduated from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, where she served as student body president, senior class president, and chair of the medical student section of the Texas Medical Association. She completed a neurosurgery residency at UCLA Medical School in 1995 and a fellowship in pediatric neurosurgery at the University of Utah School of Medicine in 1997. In 1998, she moved to Portland, Oregon, where she became director of pediatric neurosurgery at Randall Children's Hospital at Legacy Emanuel. Early political career In 2004, Wehby led an unsuccessful statewide campaign for Ballot Measure 35, which would have loosened Oregon's medical malpractice regulations, limiting damages recovered for patient injuries caused by a healthcare provider's negligence or recklessness. The measure failed by 896,857 votes (50.02%) to 896,054 (49.98%). In 2007, she was elected President of the Oregon Medical Association and in 2009, she appeared in nationwide television advertisements warning about possible problems with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). In 2011, she was elected to the board of trustees of the American Medical Association. 2014 U.S. Senate election =Declaration and early developments= In October 2013, Wehby announced that she would seek the Republican nomination for the United States Senate seat held by first-term Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley. She said that \\"I want our kids to have the same opportunities that we had. I'm really concerned when I look at the way things are going we may be the first generation that can't say that their kids are going to be better off.\\" In the primary election, she faced information technology consultant Mark Callahan, State Representative Jason Conger, attorney Tim Crawley and former Chairwoman of the Linn County Republican Party and nominee for Mayor of Albany in 2010 Jo Rae Perkins. Much of her campaign focused on criticism of the Affordable Care Act and Merkley's support for it, with her slogan of \\"Keep Your Doctor, Change Your Senator\\". She also criticized primary opponent Jason Conger for voting to set up a state-run insurance exchange. Instead, she proposed allowing people to \\"purchase an insurance plan with pretax dollars\\" and \\"buy insurance across state lines\\" as well as expanding health savings accounts and letting people have catastrophic coverage. =\\"Trust\\" advertisement and national attention= In late April, Wehby released an advertisement that received significant attention. Called \\"Trust\\", the minute- long ad was narrated by a former patient of Wehby's, who was advised to terminate her pregnancy after an ultrasound discovered a congenital disorder with her unborn daughter's spinal cord. However, Wehby successfully performed surgery after the patient's daughter was born and she survived. The ad was widely praised and drew national attention to her campaign and to the Oregon Republican primary. As Republicans were hoping to retake control of the Senate in the 2014 elections, it was hoped that Wehby's profile as a successful surgeon and moderate Republican, combined with Merkley's middling popularity and the disastrous rollout of Cover Oregon, the state's Affordable Care Act insurance exchange website, would result in Oregon coming into play as a competitive race. While Wehby drew the support of the Republican establishment and the National Republican Senatorial Committee and endorsements from national politicians such as Newt Gingrich, Mitch McConnell and Mitt Romney, she received criticism from conservatives for her moderate political positions on issues such as immigration, abortion and same-sex marriage. She was also criticised by primary opponent Jason Conger for her support of the Healthy Americans Act, co-sponsored by Oregon's other U.S. Senator, Democrat Ron Wyden, and Utah Republican Bob Bennett, which Conger said was \\"90 percent there with Obamacare\\" because it contained provisions that people purchase government-approved insurance plans. Wehby responded that it was \\"a good plan; it was a market-based approach\\" and said that she never supported the entire bill and did not think uninsured people should be mandated or enticed into buying health insurance. The battle between the more centrist, establishment- supported Wehby and the more conservative, grass-roots-supported Conger was seen as symptomatic of a Republican Party that had failed to win a statewide election in Oregon since then-U.S. Senator Gordon H. Smith was re-elected in 2002. =Increasing scrutiny= In early May, a poll released by the conservative polling organisation Vox Populi Polling showed Wehby leading Merkley by 45% to 41%. However, her candidacy also began to receive greater scrutiny. After an interview with the Willamette Week editorial board, the newspaper endorsed Jason Conger for the Republican primary, saying that although they \\"probably agree on more issues with Wehby than we do with Conger\\", there was \\"no contest\\" when it came to \\"preparation, knowledge of the issues and an ability to express the results of clear thinking.\\" They said that she \\"fumble[d] her way through\\" the interview, \\"waffled endlessly\\" and was \\"all over the map\\" on the Affordable Care Act and gave \\"befuddling answers [that] were at times disingenuous.\\" Likewise, The Bulletin also endorsed Conger over Wehby, saying that she gave \\"convoluted statements\\" to questions about various issues and added that \\"her grasp of political issues beyond health care is limited, and she has no experience in the complex give-and-take of lawmaking.\\" Wehby also declined to participate in the only live televised Republican Senate primary debate, something which the debate organisers said they couldn't ever remember happening before. Although The Oregonian endorsed her, they criticised her for declining to appear at the debate, saying that \\"wimping out in this fashion will simply call attention to her one significant weakness as a candidate, which is a lack of legislative experience that might make her seem unprepared for elective office... a capable candidate in her position should seize opportunities to prove herself to voters, not run from them.\\" Wehby was also questioned about her links to businessman Andrew Miller, a major Republican donor, who had contributed heavily to efforts to support her and oppose Jason Conger. They were reported by The Oregonian in October 2013 to be dating, although Wehby characterised their relationship as \\"friends\\". When asked if there was any collaboration between her campaign and the PAC financed by Miller, Wehby said that \\"there is absolutely no coordination between our campaign and the group.\\" The Democratic Party of Oregon filed a complaint to the Federal Election Commission, saying that it was \\"implausible\\" to think that Miller would not be privy to private information about her campaign plans and projects. In early May, it emerged that Wehby had performed several operations on the children of a woman who had a month previously been indicted on 43 counts of alleged medical abuse after forcing her children to have unnecessary surgeries. Wehby, who declined to comment, also received attention for her controversial willingness to perform tethered spinal cord surgery when other surgeons would not because MRI scans did not support the diagnosis. She said that she could \\"usually tell\\" if a child suffered from tethered spinal cord through other means, such as a description of the symptoms. Wehby has called her advocacy for the surgery her \\"proudest professional achievement\\" and said \\"It was worth all the hassles and the slings and arrows. I know that I've changed the lives of so many kids that otherwise would not have been helped.\\" At the same time, a super PAC supporting Jason Conger launched a statewide ad campaign that criticised her for saying that repealing the Affordable Care Act was \\"not politically viable at this point. We can't get it repealed with [President] Obama in office. We have to focus on coming together with solutions.\\" =Primary Results= The Oregon state primary was set to take place Tuesday May 21st as Webhy faced Representative Jason Conger. Conger had criticized Webhy for being insufficiently conservative and for her lack of political experience. Webhy ran on a platform that focused on introducing legislation that would help Oregonians get back to work and foster small business growth. Webhy received an endorsement by Ben Carson, retired surgeon, conservative activist and the 17th United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Additionally, Webhy received an endorsement from Newt Gingrich, and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. In Oregon, all elections are conducted by postal voting. Ballots for the primary election were mailed to registered Republicans on April 30, with the deadline for returning them May 20. Wehby won the election by 134,627 votes (49.96%) to Conger's 101,401 (37.63%). Information technology consultant and perennial candidate Mark Callahan received 18,220 votes (6.76% of the total). Former Chairwoman of the Linn County Republican Party and candidate for Mayor of Albany in 2010 Jo Rae Perkins received 7,602 votes (2.82% of the total) and Tim Crawley received 6,566 votes (2.44%), with 1,027 write-in votes (0.38%). Conger declined to endorse Webhy inmediatly after the election results were published, expressing frustration with what he perceived as the NRSC’s preference for her. In her victory speech, Wehby thanked Republican voters and claimed that \\"people were tired of the democrat's dirty tricks\\". She ended the speech by reciting her campaign slogan: \\"Keep your doctor, change your senator.\\" =Post-primary= After winning the primary, Wehby largely went to ground for three weeks. On June 10, in her first post-primary appearance, she attended a meet-and-greet with supporters in Oregon City, where she answered questions from reporters. Asked about the allegations of stalking and harassment, Wehby replied: \\"I think that the thing to learn from that is that I am a person who will stand up for what I believe in. I'm a person who doesn't easily back down. I will fight for Oregonians with very strong conviction. I'm a very committed, determined person.\\" In July, Wehby's campaign revealed that she had raised over $955,000 in the second fundraising quarter. By contrast, Merkley had raised $1.8 million. On 6 September, a super PAC affiliated with the Koch brothers announced that it was cancelling all the television ad time that it had reserved in October, totalling almost $1 million, having previously spent heavily on Wehby's behalf. At the same time, a new Rasmussen Reports poll found Wehby trailing Merkley by 48% to 35%, compared to her trailing 47% to 37% in the firm's last poll of the race in May. In early September, Wehby's campaign aired a campaign ad featuring Ben West, who was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that overturned Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage. =Debates= In late September, Wehby refused an invitation to participate with Merkley in a televised debate on October 23, which was to be hosted by KGW TV and The Oregonian. KGW executive news director Rick Jacobs said \\"I can't recall a major candidate ever refusing our offer to debate\\" and political scientist Jim Moore said that her refusal to debate \\"goes against everything we know challengers ought to do -- have as many debates as possible.\\" Wehby met with Merkley in the only debate of the campaign, hosted by KOBI (TV), on October 14. Both candidates painted the other as extreme and they clashed on issues including the minimum wage, which Merkley supported increasing and Wehby opposed increasing. =Positions= Wehby describes herself as \\"personally pro-life,\\" and has taken moderate positions on abortion and same-sex marriage, stating that the federal government should not be involved in those issues.http://www.salon.com/2014/06/16/the_rights_overhyped_disaster_why_monica_wehby_is_falling_flat_in_oregon/http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/09/20/3389743/gop- doctor-appeals-on-social- issues.htmlhttp://www.salon.com/2014/09/18/gops_hilarious_plagiarism_flap_why_monica_wehbys_healthcare_debacle_has_them_fuming/ She is politically pro-choice on the issue of abortion and reproductive issues. She announced her support for same-sex marriage in a campaign ad. =Results and analysis= Wehby was defeated by Merkley in the general election by a wide margin, receiving 498,191 votes (37.1%) to his 744,516 (55.8%). Political scientist Jim Moore summarised her campaign as \\"one disaster after another\\", blaming \\"very poor campaign management\\". By contrast, Jeff Mapes of The Oregonian noted that Merkley ran a vigorous and professional campaign. =Post-Senate Race= After losing to Sen. Jeff Merkley in 2014, Wehby stated her desire to remain in politics to \\"help people feel better represented by their government.\\" In 2015, reports started coming out claiming that she was being courted by both Republican and Democrat leaders to run for Governor. On February 18, 2015, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber resigned amid a public corruption scandal; Kate Brown succeeded him since the Constitution of Oregon identifies the secretary of state as the successor when the governor leaves office prematurely. Oregon law required a special election in November 2016 for the two years remaining in Kitzhaber's unfinished term as governor. By April 2016 Brown had raised over $800,000 for her campaign in 2016 alone.

White (born January 26, 1954) is an attorney in his native Greenville, South Carolina, who has served as his city's 34th and current mayor since December 11, 1995, a longer tenure than any other mayor of Greenville. Previously, he was an at-large member of the Greenville City Council from 1983 to 1993. He won another four-year term most recently in November 2015 and was unopposed in 2019. Background White graduated from Christ Church Episcopal School, Greenville Senior High School, Wake Forest University in North Carolina, and the University of South Carolina School of Law in the capital city of Columbia. He is a partner in the law firm Haynsworth, Sinkler & Boyd, with his specialization in immigration and customs. He and his wife, Marsha P. White (born c. 1955), have two children. Political life At the age of eighteen, White was an alternate delegate to the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, which re-nominated the Nixon-Agnew ticket. In 1988, at the age of thirty-four, White was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for South Carolina's 4th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives. His campaign was determined and well- financed, and backed by Governor Carroll A. Campbell, Jr., who formerly held the House seat himself. He lost narrowly to the Democratic incumbent Liz J. Patterson, the daughter of former U.S. Senator Olin D. Johnston. This came even as George H. W. Bush carried the 4th by a large margin. =Mayoral tenure= Greenville has operated since 1976 under the city manager form of government, with an elected mayor and six-member city council, four chosen by district and two at-large. White was elected mayor in 1995 and has been reelected every four years since. Under White's tenure as mayor, Greenville has avoided direct increases in property tax rates and kept its bond rating high. Upon taking office, White announced an overall theme of making Greenville \\"the most beautiful and livable city in America.\\" Toward this goal, White has pushed for neighborhood and downtown revitalization and an emphasis on economic development. Greenville during the White administration has removed the Camperdown Bridge and established Falls Park, the birthplace of Greenville. The city restored both Court Street and the Poinsett Hotel, now a Westin facility named for Joel R. Poinsett. A new retail establishment, the Mast General Store, and the baseball stadium Fluor Field have been added to the downtown. White focused Greenville's development along the Reedy River and oversaw the creation of a system of walking and bicycle trails throughout the city. Public art flourishes along Main Street. There have been annexations and improvements in the infrastructure to accommodate the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research, a part of Clemson University in Clemson. White has worked to lessen traffic noise, construct more sidewalks, revitalize parks, enhance beautification, and encourage the establishment of neighborhood associations. New housing has been constructed in special- emphasis neighborhoods. See also *Max Heller *Jesse L. Helms *Harry B. Luthi *R.

Biography Polly Morgan was born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England in 1980, and grew up in the Cotswolds on her family farm, and mentions a lack of squeamishness about death as well as being comfortable with the practice of dealing with the corpses of animals. She moved to East London in 1998 and continues to live there today. Morgan graduated from Queen Mary, University of London, in English Literature in 2002. During her studies, Morgan worked at Shoreditch Electricity Show Rooms, a bar popular with artists; after graduation, she continued to work there as manager. At 23 Morgan was living above the bar and working out of her apartment, \\"tinkering with taxidermy.\\" Inspired to create work of her own she took a course with the professional taxidermist George Jamieson, of Cramond, in Edinburgh, during which her intuitive and personal response to the medium were obvious. Morgan's first pieces were commissioned by Bistrotheque, after which she was spotted by Banksy: A lovebird looking in a mirror; a squirrel holding a belljar with a little fly perched inside on top of a sugar cube; a magpie with a jewel in its beak; and a couple of chicks standing on a miniature coffin'. In 2005, he invited her to show her work for Santa's Ghetto, an annual exhibition he organized near London's Oxford Street. Her next piece, a white rat in a champagne glass, was exhibited at Wolfe Lenkiewicz's Zoo Art Fair in 2006 and was purchased by Vanessa Branson. Morgan works from a Bethnal Green studio. Morgan is a member of the UK Guild of Taxidermists. The animals used in her taxidermy are contributed by a network of clients; the animals Morgan uses have died naturally or had unpreventable deaths. She maintains a detailed log of all dead animals in stock. Morgan believes that those who consider her work disrespectful or cruel to animals are \\"childish,\\" and that anthropomorphizing the animals she uses is meaningless. Her work emphasizes and displays animals in a way nontraditional to taxidermy, putting the animals in positions which do not generally imply that they are still alive, rather emphasizing the dying fall of the animal.Connor, Steven. \\"Such Stuff as Dreams are Made on.\\" Modern Painters 21, no. 2 (03, 2009): 58-63. http://stevenconnor.com/stuff/stuff.pdf.

The lake serves water to 130,000 people in the greater Utica, New York area, is a source of hydropower, and supports recreation during all seasons. The lake is located in the towns of Russia in Herkimer County, and Remsen in Oneida County. Gregory B. Jarvis Plant is named in honor of Gregory Jarvis, a 41-year-old payload specialist from the Mohawk Valley who was killed aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986. This 9,000-kW facility began operation in June of that year. The plant is located about 20 miles from Mohawk Central High School, where Jarvis graduated in 1963.www.nypa.gov  Geography  The topography of its watershed of 372 square miles is rugged and varies in altitude from about 1,165 to 3,100 feet above sea-level. The drainage basin of this creek, like that of the upper Mohawk, is located in the region which has the maximum precipitation of the state, a precipitation which is exceptionally high during the winter months, in the form of snow. No constricted gorge, where a short dam might be built, was available on the site of this reservoir. The dam has a total length of 3,700 feet, of which there is a 400-foot masonry section, embodying gate chambers and spillway. The major, or earthen, portion of the dam has a concrete core wall running through most of its length. The masonry content of the dam is 110,020 cubic yards, while there are 611,200 cubic yards of embankment in the earthen section. The masonry has a maximum height of 82 feet above rock and the overfall at the spillway is 61 feet. The maximum height of the earthen dam is 56 feet above the natural surface. The lake forks into two parts, which have a combined length of about thirteen miles but no great width, only about a half mile. Its area is 4.46 square miles and its capacity 3,445,000,000 cubic feet. The maximum depth at crest level is 75 feet and the average depth, 28 feet. It necessitated the removal of 209 buildings, which made up parts of three villages, and it submerged seven miles of highways. This lake too is of much value for flood regulation, the maximum rate of flood discharge being very materially reduced. Fishing The lake also offers sport fishing. Fish species that are present in the reservoir are smallmouth bass, rock bass, black bullhead, pickerel, trout, and yellow perch. There is a boat launch that requires a fee, located on the west shore off NY-365. It accommodates launching of all boat sizes. There is also a boat rental business on the lake. History The public water supply of Utica was owned and operated by the Consolidated Water Company. The original supply was installed in 1850 and consisted of a reservoir supplied by the so-called Graftenberg springs, located in the hills south of the city. As the population increased additional reservoirs were constructed and surface streams impounded, constituting what is known as the southern supply. In about 1907 the supply from the West Canada creek was introduced into the city. In 1915 the barge canal reservoir at Hinckley was completed. It is from this reservoir that the West Canada Creek supply was taken, at least through 1918. In February, 1917, a rather serious but localized break of typhoid fever occurred in Utica, New York which upon an investigation by this Department was attributed to an infection of the water in the mains through cross connections between auxiliary fire supplies from polluted sources. The results of analyses of the raw water from the Hinckley supply have shown in the past a moderate amount of active contamination as indicated by the total bacterial counts and the presence of organisms of the E. coli type. 39th Annual Report NYS Department of Health 12/31/1918 via Google Books In 1928, the name was officially changed to Kayuhoora Lake after land owners encouraged the state committee of geographic names to alter the name but it never took as people continued to call it Hinckley Lake. Status in 1918 The intake at the Hinckley Lake consisted of a gate house located about midway of the dam, the point of intake being about 25 feet below the water surface. From this intake the water flowed by gravity through about 10 miles of 24-inch mains to a diverting reservoir located in the town of Marcy about 6 miles north of Utica. From this lake water was diverted to 2 distributing reservoirs, one known as the Marcy reservoir, located in the town of Marcy and the other, known as the Deerfield Reservoir, located in the town of Deerfield. The Marcy reservoir was an open reservoir formed by earthen embankments paved on the inner slopes and with a capacity of 15,000.000 gallons. From this reservoir a 24-inch main led to the northwestern section of the city's distribution mains. The Deerfield reservoir was of similar construction to that of the Marcy reservoir and had a storage capacity of approximately 106,000,000 gallons. From this reservoir a 20-inch main led into the city distribution system at the foot of Genesee street. On the New Hartford distribution system was a stand-pipe with a capacity of 150,000 gallons and on the Oriskany distribution system is a stand-pipe with 250,000 gallons capacity. Another supply has been obtained in the past from a small intake dam on Keels creek not far from the Deerfield reservoir. This however is not now used. The water company is required to maintain a monthly patrol of the watersheds and to maintain sanitary conditions thereon in accordance with the stipulations of the rules.  Dam construction  Built across the West Canada Creek near the village of Hinckley. The dam was constructed by the State of New York and completed in 1915 for the purpose of supplying water to the enlarged canal. Hinckley Reservoir was located at its present site primarily because of its proximity to the canal and its elevation above the canal. The dam is 3,700 feet long, mainly an earthen structure with a concrete core wall. At the creek channel there are gate chambers and a spillway 400 feet long. The masonry contents of this dam are 110,020 cubic yards, while the embankment amounts to 611,200 cubic yards. The maximum height of masonry above rock is 82 feet and the overfall at the spillway, 61 feet. The area of the reservoir at crest level is 4.46 square miles, its maximum depth is 75 feet and average depth of 28 feet. The reservoirs capacity is 3,445,000,000 cubic feet.
