From 1789 to 1790 and from 1791 until his death in 1810 he was regent of Tibet, appointed by the Qing dynasty of China. He was the first owner of the Kundeling Monastery, founded in 1794 in Lhasa. Early life Yeshe Lobsang Tenpai Gonpo was the eighth Tatsag incarnation and the third to take the name \\"Tatsag\\". He was born in 1860 in the Powo region of Kham. When he was aged five he was recognized as the reincarnation of the Seventh Tatsak Jedrung, Lobzang Pelgyen. The incarnation line had originated with Baso Chokyi Gyeltsen (1402‚Äì73), a disciple of Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa. On being recognized he entered the Pasho (dPa'-shod) Monastery, founded in 1473 in Chamdo, Kham. He was enthroned and given a seal, diploma and tiara. From 1767 to 1771 he studied under Khenchen Zasak Pelden Drakpa, who granted him his lay vows. In 1771 Tatsag went to study at the Kumbum Monastery in present-day Qinghai, a Gelug institution. He went on to Chengde, a summer palace of the Qing emperors that lay on the border between China and Mongolia. There he became close to Changkya R√∂lp√© Dorj√© (1717‚Äì86), from whom he received his novice vows and the name \\"Yeshe Tenpai Gonpo\\". In 1772 he visited Beijing, where the Qianlong Emperor received the boy in audience, gave him presents, and granted thirteen servants and the allowances of an official. The emperor treated Tatsag as his tham-ka bla-ma, or \\"lama of the seal\\", a high honor. From 1774 Tatsag studied in Chengde under the abbot of the Tashilhunpo Monastery, Shartse Khenpo Nominhan Lobzang Jampel. When Lobsang Palden Yeshe, 6th Panchen Lama (1738‚Äì80) visited Chengde in 1780, the emperor presented Tatsag to him wearing a dragon robe. Tatsag traveled back to Lhasa in 1781‚Äì82, where he joined the Gomang faculty of Drepung Monastery and studied for the next eight years. One of his teachers was the 8th Dalai Lama, who ordained him in 1782. Tatsag was admitted into the monastic order the next year. Political leader Portrait of the 8th Tatsag held by the Rubin Museum of Art In 1786 Tatsag was among the Tibetans who congratulated the emperor on his birthday. That year he was appointed assistant to the Dalai Lama after the former regent had been recalled to Beijing. The Dalai Lama was of an age to rule alone, but the Qing rulers did not consider that he had the required skills and felt it was best for him to have a purely religious role. In 1788 the emperor gave Tatsag the title \\"lama of the seal\\" for the region of Dolonnor in Inner Mongolia, and called him to Beijing. While he was traveling to China in 1789 he received a command from the emperor to return to Lhasa and assume the regency. He was regent from 26 May 1789 to 28 September 1790. His mandate and the titles bestowed on him by the emperor indicate that he was in effect the Qing dynasty's first viceroy in Tibet. On 28 September 1790 the emperor removed Tatsag from office and called him to Beijing, in an edict that said he had not been \\"diligent and careful\\" in handling the Dalai Lama's affairs. He was replaced by the previous regent, the First Tsemonling. The Dalai Lama's brother was accused in the same edict of numerous abuses. The Dalai Lama himself was exonerated from all blame, but was directed to take no part in government but to concentrate on his religious studies. In April 1791 the First Tsemonling died. Tatsag was traveling to China via the southern route when he was commanded to return to Lhasa and resume the regency, which he held until his death in 1811. The emperor said that the criticism in the previous edict had been mistaken. In 1792 the emperor granted Tatsag the title of hui-t'ung ch'an-shih and a silver seal. He became proprietor of the Kundeling Monastery in Lhasa in 1794. The Kundeling Monastery was founded by the general Fuk'anggan (d.1796) and the amban Helin in 1794 to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Sino-Nepalese War. It was granted to the Tatsag lineage in perpetuity. In 1799 Tatsag visited the fourth Panchen Lama in Tashilhunpo Monastery. The 8th Dalai Lama died in 1804. Tatsag was given the diploma and seal of a regent, and that year had a prayer for the rebirth of the 8th Dalai Lama printed and distributed throughout Tibet. In 1808 he led the selection of the 9th Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso (1806‚Äì15). Tatsag died on 30 December 1810. One source says he died peacefully at his Kundeling Monastery, while another says he committed suicide by biting off his tongue. He was described by the Amban Ho-lin (1753‚Äì96) as a man of upright character, calm countenance and an unerring sense of justice. He was loyal to the Qing dynasty while regent in Tibet. He left more than ninety texts. Portrait A painting of Gyaltsab Yeshe Lobzang Tanpa'i Gonpo in ground mineral pigment on cotton is held by the Rubin Museum of Art in New York City.

Nine people were killed, including the gunman, 63-year-old Zdenƒõk Kov√°≈ô, who committed suicide after a standoff with police that lasted nearly two hours. In addition, one other person was injured. Uhersk√Ω Brod is 260 kilometers (160 miles) east- southeast of the Czech capital Prague. Prior to the 2020 Bohum√≠n arson attack, the shooting was one of the two deadliest mass murders in the country's peacetime history, alongside a 1973 vehicular rampage committed by Olga Hepnarov√°. The circumstances of the shooting led to an examination of gun politics in the Czech Republic and police rules of engagement against active shooters. Czech media speculated that the rampage may have been triggered by an apparent attempt of the authorities to review Kov√°≈ô's mental state. Background Due to similarities between the perpetrators, the shooting was compared by Czech media and experts to an explosion that took place two years before in Fren≈°t√°t pod Radho≈°tƒõm, another Moravian town lying 90 km northwards. Before the shooting, Kov√°≈ô's family became worried about his mental state to the point that they contacted authorities in connection with his possession of a gun license. Just four days before the shooting, Kov√°≈ô had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. Before entering the Dru≈æba restaurant, Kov√°≈ô visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and Kov√°≈ô left them immediately after entering. Shooting Kov√°≈ô entered the Dru≈æba building at about 12:30 pm, the restaurant's busiest daylight time. Around 20 people were in the small restaurant at the time. Before he entered the restaurant itself, which was situated on the first floor, Petr Gabriel, who was rushing to the bathroom, got ahead of Kov√°≈ô on stairs leading to an upper floor. Armed with a CZ 75B semi-automatic pistol, which is manufactured in the town, and an Alfa 820 revolver, Kov√°≈ô opened fire without any warning immediately after entering the restaurant, shooting his victims directly in the head. Eight died immediately or soon afterwards. One female victim, who was shot twice in the chest, managed to leave the restaurant, while Gabriel remained hidden in the restaurant's bathroom. Eight other people escaped the building through the back door. Another customer, Ji≈ô√≠ Nes√°zel, who took cover under a table, used a moment in which Kov√°≈ô was reloading, and threw a chair at him, hitting him on the neck. This gave him an opportunity to run out through the front door with two other people. Authorities received the first distress call from a person who escaped from the restaurant at 12:38 pm, and the first police car reached the building at 12:47 pm. The policemen were armed with the standard equipment for Czech police officers: holstered pistols (mostly with variants of CZ 75 that was also used by Kov√°≈ô), body armor, and a select-fire rifle stored in their cars. The first two officers to arrive immediately entered the building with body armor on and guns drawn. Kov√°≈ô, taking cover behind a bar opposite to the door, opened fire on the officers as soon as they entered. The police noted people lying on the ground and sitting on chairs between them and Kov√°≈ô. Not knowing the status of the civilians, the police decided not to return fire, covered the exits, and waited for the arrival of a tactical unit. By this time, other police units as well as the first ambulance car had arrived, taking away the wounded female victim who had escaped. At 12:56 pm, Kov√°≈ô called a Prima TV station crime news reporter, claiming that he was being harassed by multiple people and that he had hostages whom he threatened to kill. The journalist who spoke to Kov√°≈ô called the police, who were already sending all available units to the location. A police negotiator contacted Kov√°≈ô by phone at 13:07. During negotiations, Kov√°≈ô claimed to have hostages, although all of the people remaining inside were most likely already dead (apart from Gabriel, who was hiding in the bathroom, unbeknownst to Kov√°≈ô). The hostage claim delayed police entry into the building. Kov√°≈ô stopped communicating at about 14:00 p.m. After attempts to contact him failed, the tactical team breached the building at 14:23 p.m. Upon the team's entry, Kov√°≈ô immediately shot himself dead. Apart from stun grenades, the policemen did not fire a single shot. After securing the restaurant, the police let in a large number of medical personnel. The only person alive who remained inside the building was Gabriel, who had been hiding in the bathroom for the entire duration of the incident. Perpetrator and victims =Perpetrator= Zdenƒõk Kov√°≈ô ( ‚Äì 24 February 2015) was 63 years old at the time of his death and lived with his wife in a house not far from the scene of the shooting. Neighbours described the couple as deranged, both possibly mentally ill, and known for loudness and verbal abuse of their neighbours. Kov√°≈ô was the son of a worker in the local (ƒåZUB) firearms factory, the largest small arms manufacturer in the country. Formerly an electrician, he had been unemployed for at least ten years. Kov√°≈ô's wife was taken to a psychiatric hospital following the shooting. Kov√°≈ô had held a gun license since 2000, and legally owned both of the guns he used. =Victims= A total of eight people, excluding the gunman, died in the rampage. This included seven men, aged 27 to 66, and one woman, aged 47. Another woman, aged 37, survived despite being shot twice in the chest. Aftermath Number of legally owned firearms in the Czech Republic (in thousands) and total number of victims of intentional homicide by any object As more information about Kov√°≈ô's notoriety among neighbors surfaced, focus of investigation shifted towards the circumstances under which he gained and retained a gun license and firearms. In order to be granted a gun license in the Czech Republic, a person must pass a qualification exam, receive a health clearance by a general practitioner, who may require a further examination by a specialist, such as a psychological or psychiatric evaluation, and must pass a background check. According to Section 23 of the Czech Firearms Act, an applicant may not be granted a license if they have committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in the previous three years. Similarly, the law further makes a gun license inaccessible to people with mental illnesses. Annex 1 The license must be renewed every five years (every ten years for licenses issued after 1 July 2014). The renewal requires the presentation of a new health clearance, while the police conduct a new background check. Kov√°≈ô's license was renewed in January 2015. =Misdemeanors registry= Kov√°≈ô applied for a gun license renewal in accordance with the law. According to Kov√°≈ô's brother-in-law, neighbors, and a local policeman who had repeated contacts with him, Kov√°≈ô and his wife had committed misdemeanors against public order. The municipality of Uhersk√Ω Brod, which deals with such misdemeanors, did not register them and thus Kov√°≈ô had an apparently clean history. In turn, this satisfied the requirements and he had his license renewed. The renewal of his license was due to the fact that while there is a central registry of crimes and of traffic misdemeanors, no such registry exists for other misdemeanors in the Czech Republic. In the case where a non-traffic misdemeanor is solved on the spot (e.g. fining by a policeman), no record of it is made. Only when the investigated person or the police refuse to deal with the misdemeanor on the spot, is an administrative proceeding before a municipal misdemeanor committee initiated and if convicted, then a record of it is made by the municipality. The Czech government had made a decision to introduce a central registry for all misdemeanors in October 2014, planning to have the system working within two years. As police are obliged to revoke a gun license when the licensee has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in a period of three years, the central registry of misdemeanors might have allowed police to effectively revoke the license long before the shooting. =Health clearance= At any time, the police may order a new health clearance inspection if they have a reasonable concern that the person is not healthy enough to continue holding their license. According to the Uhersk√Ω Brod mayor Patrik Kunƒçar, Kov√°≈ô's family members tried to prevent Kov√°≈ô from having the license renewed by pleading with his general practitioner not to grant him the necessary health clearance, since they felt threatened and considered him mentally unstable. Nevertheless, Kov√°≈ô received clearance from his general practitioner and presented it as a part of his license renewal application on 19 January 2015. After renewing the license in January, the police were contacted by an unspecified person who reported to them on Kov√°≈ô's mental state. The police subsequently contacted Kov√°≈ô's general practitioner and psychiatrist, and on 17 February 2015 ordered a health reevaluation. He received the letter on 19 February 2015, four days before the shooting. Under the law, Kov√°≈ô was obliged to present a new health clearance within a month or lose the license. Czech media has speculated that the apparent attempt of the authorities to review Kov√°≈ô's mental state may have triggered the rampage. A few days after the shooting, the Ministry of Interior announced its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients may be more likely to avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license. =Police response= One of the main topics of debate after Kov√°≈ô's rampage became the way police dealt with him, especially whether the first two responding officers were, under the circumstances, supposed to immediately engage and neutralize Kov√°≈ô, and whether the decision to wait for the arrival of the tactical unit was sound. The debate became more vocal after a cook, who managed to escape the rampage, claimed that she heard a slow series of single shots coming from the restaurant after the police had retreated. Another witness, who escaped unharmed, refuted this version of events, saying that shots were fired only during the initial ten minutes leading up to the point of police entry, with no shots heard thereafter. Police said the first responders decided not to engage because they saw civilians lying and sitting in the line of fire between them and Kov√°≈ô; they didn't know their status, and Kov√°≈ô had taken cover behind a bar with only his head and hand holding the pistol visible. According to the Chief of the Zl√≠n Regional Police Department, Jarom√≠r Tkadleƒçek, the Uhersk√Ω Brod district units present had enough manpower and equipment, including select-fire rifles, to engage Kov√°≈ô. However, they decided to withdraw due to Kov√°≈ô's claim of having hostages and stated intent to negotiate their release. Apart from local units, a special ordnance unit was called in from its regional headquarters in Zl√≠n. It arrived about 30 minutes later. Because there are eight tactical teams covering fourteen Czech regions and none in Zl√≠n, a tactical team from Brno was called in. The team's fifteen members reached the restaurant by cars in 66 minutes, opting not to use their helicopter that has a capacity of six. Furthermore, a paramilitary anti-terrorist police URNA unit was called from Prague. However, its helicopters arrived after the end of the standoff. According to Tkadleƒçek, even if URNA had its headquarters directly in Uhersk√Ω Brod, it would not have changed anything about the timing nor the manner in which the police engaged Kov√°≈ô. Zl√≠n region politicians announced they would call for the establishment of a local tactical team. Meanwhile, the Minister of Interior commented that the police were already in the process of hiring 4,000 new officers (about 10% of its total manpower), thus reversing cuts enacted by previous governments. Experts further pointed out the necessity to provide more CQB training to policemen in small municipalities and at rural areas. This type of training had until that point been largely aimed and directed at police officers in large towns. On 10 March 2015, weekly newspaper Respekt published more details of the police engagement. By chance, an emergency motorized police unit, which usually serves as immediate reinforcement to police officers in the field, was conducting exercises not far from Uhersk√Ω Brod. The unit arrived within twenty minutes of the first emergency call. Heavily armed and well trained, their officer in charge gave order to immediately engage Kov√°≈ô. Within a minute, the local police station chief arrived and ordered them to stand down, began securing the perimeter, gathering information, and preparing an engagement plan. Meanwhile, Kov√°≈ô called the emergency line 158 and mentioned he had five unharmed hostages and was demanding the presence of TV Prima. The officer in charge ordered the policemen to stand down just as they were about to enter the building in order to start negotiating. At that time, he could not have been aware of the status of victims inside. Fifteen minutes later, the Zl√≠n region police chief arrived. In total, the command over the operation was passed between five people within the initial 40 minutes. The fact that the police rules allow passing of command during engagement had been condemned a week earlier by Member of Parliament Stanislav Huml, who pointed out the Czech firemen's rules, according to which the first person in charge at the place of engagement remains in charge even if a general happens to come to join an operation afterwards. He noted that the passing of command requires briefing which not only leads to loss of time, but often also to subsequent mistakes. As of May 2015, the only direct outcome of the inquiry into the police response to the shooting was the lowering of wage of a dispatch officer, who advised the policemen over the radio not to engage \\"so that nothing worse happens\\". In June 2015, two members of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uhersk√Ω Brod and talked to multiple witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of Kov√°≈ô, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed Kov√°≈ô to escape from the building and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of Kov√°≈ô. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards to communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe Kov√°≈ô's claim of having hostages even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1 pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information. =Gun politics= In one of the first reactions on the day of the shooting, before knowing whether Kov√°≈ô possessed the guns he used legally, Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec stated that it was up for debate whether \\"[the society] wants to have so many gun license holders\\". Support for Chovanec's comments was largely among members of parliament elected for the Communist Party. Others accused Chovanec of abusing the tragedy for his own political benefit. Some members of parliament, such as Miroslav Antl, Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee, commented that the licensing process is thorough enough, and pointed out that he considers carrying a concealed firearm to be a necessity due to a variety of reasons, especially during a time of rising threats of Islamic terrorist attacks. Roman V√°≈àa, Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec's own Social Democratic party, refused Chovanec's argument, while some other members of parliament went in the opposite direction, claiming that there are too few armed people among the Czech population, since a single armed civilian might have stopped Kov√°≈ô's assault. This sentiment was shared by Martin Koller, a former ambassador to Kuwait and Iraq, who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force, and who pointed out the Charlie Hebdo shooting, stating that the attack might have ended quite differently had the victims been armed. MF Dnes pointed out that despite the steady rise of firearm ownership in the country since abolition of restrictive Communist legislation after the Velvet Revolution, the number of intentional homicide victims has been steadily falling since its peak in 1994. During a press conference on 26 February 2015, Chovanec introduced five areas that were to be scrutinized in connection with the Uhersk√Ω Brod attack: the communication of national police with municipal authorities, possible changes in crisis plans, operational range of tactical teams, and enhanced training of policemen. Chovanec didn't repeat his sentiment regarding the number of gun license holders, and instead specified that one of the issues to be analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation. Reactions Czech Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec said on Twitter that the shooting was not a terrorist incident but the actions of a \\"crazed individual\\". Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who was on a trip to South Korea at the time, said in a statement, \\"I am shocked by the tragic attack that happened today in Uhersk√Ω Brod.

Location and landscape  The mountain rises between St. Anton am Arlberg in the Stanzer valley and Ischgl in the Paznaun to the southeast. Northeast of the summit is the Darmst√§dter Hut.Peter Pindur, Roland Luzian, Andreas Weiskopf: 1790 K√ºchlspitze 3147 m in Alpine Club Guide Verwallgruppe 1988, pp. 216 ff. The K√ºchlspitze (which means \\"little Kuchenspitze\\") is the third highest peak in the range after the Hoher Riffler and 1 metre higher Kuchenspitze immediately to the north. It is a striking, three-sided pyramid. On the main ridge the eastern ar√™te descends to the Rautej√∂chli () and Rautekopf (), the southwestern ar√™te to the Sch√∂npleisj√∂chli () and twin peaks of the Sch√∂npleisk√∂pfe (northern , southern ), and the northern ar√™te runs in an S-shape to the Kuchenspitze. The mountain is glaciated; in the north cirque (Nordkar) of the Kuchenspitze lies the Gro√üer K√ºchlferner glacier. The Kleine K√ºchlferner on the western flank is only a glacial remnant. The Gro√üe K√ºchlferner drains into the Kartellspeicher reservoir and the Moosbach into the Rosanna, the west flank, with a tarn at into the Fasulbach, which empties into the upper Rosanna. The Madleinalpe to the southeast, which also has several tarns, drains via the Madleinbach into the Trisannna.  Development and ascents  The first ascents of the summit were made by survey engineers accompanied by a local chamois hunter as part of the Third k.u.k. State Survey around 1860, in the course of which the main chain of the Verwall was negotiated. The mountain is rarely visited today. It may be ascended, for example, from St. Anton from the Sch√∂nverwall near the Konstanzer Hut directly or via the Kuchenj√∂chl saddle, or via the Moosbach valley (Kartellspeicher), and from the south from Ischgl across the Madleinalpe, or from Mathon via the Friedrichshafner Hut. The Darmst√§dter Hut is usually used as the base.

Chambers. The film was directed by J. Stuart Blackton and produced by Albert E. Smith. It stars Lou Tellegen, Anna Q. Nilsson, and Norman Kerry. The feature was distributed by Vitagraph Studios, which was founded by Blackton and Smith in 1897 in Brooklyn, New York. The film is lost. Synopsis Jack Greylock runs away with the wife of his lifelong friend, David Drene, a sculptor. Drene only knows that his wife has fled; he does not know the identity of the man with whom she went. The wife kills herself from remorse and Greylock returns to keep up the semblance of his ancient friendship with the sculptor, who buries his sorrow in his work. Cecile Waite, a model, poses for Drene and Greylock, upon meeting her, falls honestly in love with her. She, however, loves Drene, who is apparently oblivious. Drene learns through another friend that Greylock was responsible for his wife's downfall. He first intends to kill him, but perceiving Greylock's love for the model, resolves to work his vengeance through Cecile. Drene threatens her. Greylock pleads for mercy for the girl and eventually agrees to kill himself at midnight Christmas Eve if Drene will spare her. Drene's brooding overturns his reason for a time and after a night of delirium, he collapses. Cecile finds him and nurses him back to health. The sculptor regains consciousness on Christmas Eve, his disposition improved. He sends Cecile to tell Greylock of his changed mood, but she cannot get into the house where Greylock is slowly preparing to keep his pledge. Drene then telepathically draws Greylock to his home and absolves him of his promise. :American Silent Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Feature Films Cast *Lou Tellegen as David Drene *Anna Q.

However, in her book J. Stuart Blackton: A Personal Biography by His Daughter (June 1985), Marian Blackton Trimble writes that her father was unhappy with Gaskill's adaption of Chamber's novel, saying: \\"The script proved too involved, too scholarly, top heavy with long, platitudinous titles, the cardinal sin of the silent movie, and soggy with prolonged, unclimaxed scenes\\" (p. 150). Trimble says in her book that while en route by train from New York to Los Angeles, she penned a script that was acceptable to her father and actor Lou Tellegen as well, but Trimble received no credit for her work. Trimble went on to receive credit for other features under the pseudonym Marian Constance, mainly in films where she was working with her father. In a review of the film in The Film Daily, dated April 20, 1924, a list of credits for the film include Marion Constance along with Chas. L Gaskill for scenario. Trimble also states in her book (p. 152) that her father \\"was one of the first, if not the first\\", to utilize the technique of montage shots in his films. When the film played at the Forum Theatre in Los Angeles, the silent film The Haunted Hotel (1907), was shown in connection with Blackton's film. The showing of the old film proved to be a hit and other exhibitors started requesting early-day pictures from Vitagraph as well. The Exhibitors Herald reported in 1924 that Blackton had purportedly \\"invented a new technical arrangement of lights by which he has procured effects in photography which never before have been shown on the screen...the experiments were conducted in Los Angeles and used for the first time in the studio set of Between Friends, where a model poses for a statue\\". =Other adaptions= In February 1918, Vitagraph released The Woman Between Friends, a silent film which featured Robert Walker, Edith Speare and Marc McDermott. During filming, Walker accidentally shot at himself, but wasn't injured in the mishap. Reviews and reception When the film premiered at the Rivoli Theater in New York, local newspapers were mixed in their reviews. The New York Times review said \\"there are black cats, apples handed to the hero by the pretty model and an utterly overdone bit of suspense toward the end of the picture, together with scenic long-distance hypnotism\\". The American considered the film \\"the best thing J. Stuart Blackton has made in a long, long time\\". The Daily News was harsh in their criticism of the feature saying, \\"just as the characters in this Robert W. Chambers story were cheap and unreal, so are they in the film\\". The Morning Telegraph praised the film stating that \\"it is many a day since Mr. Blackton has made a better picture, not only has he handled a strong story with intelligent dignity and repression, but he has skillfully avoided an interpretation which easily could have made it objectionable to the censors and the censorious\\". A reviewer for the New York Evening Post blasted the film saying, \\"How anything so frightfully poor, so hilariously ridiculous and generally terrible could ever be screened at all, much less shown at a Broadway house, passeth comprehension...it's so thoroughly atrocious that the problem of trying to review it staggers the mind of ye reviewer\\". Henriette Sloane gave the film a positive review in the Exhibitors Trade Review, stating that it was \\"armed with an unusually strong cast of noted stars...and was a very satisfactory and decidedly entertaining photoplay which should provide the average audience with a very pleasant matinee or evening\\". She also noted that the \\"story is alive with romance, thrills and suspense\\". A review in The Film Daily was also positive stating the film had \\"some new twists in this latest eternal triangle plot and there's a splendid production and fine cast that also help to make the picture interesting\\".

The train engineer died from his injuries a week later and 29 others were injured. Background This portion of the main coastal rail line is parallel with 5th Street between Camarillo and Oxnard. Besides Metrolink, the line is used by Amtrak and by the line's owner, Union Pacific for freight. Firefighters had previously pulled vehicles off the tracks at this at-grade crossing about 18 times. An overpass had been planned for almost two decades for the busy Rice Avenue crossing where the accident occurred. Funding, however, remained unavailable in Ventura County for the estimated $35 million grade separation project. Accident NTSB investigator examines truck involved in the crash NTSB investigator examines wreckage The accident occurred at 5:44 a.m. local time (13:44 UTC) when a passenger train collided with a 2005 Ford F-450 pick-up truck and trailer on the Rice Avenue grade crossing in Oxnard, California. The train derailed, with three cars falling onto their sides and a fourth remaining upright, as did the locomotive which was pushing the train from the rear. The train was traveling from East Ventura to Los Angeles and was accelerating after leaving the Oxnard station away from the crash site. It was traveling at when the emergency brakes were applied and had slowed to when it hit the truck. The train's usual cruising speed is ; it was traveling under that speed. The train cars consisted of a Hyundai Rotem cab car #645, three Hyundai Rotem bi-level cars #206, #211 and #263, and an EMD F59PH diesel-electric locomotive #870 at the rear. All four cars derailed, with #263 remaining upright. According to the train crew, the truck appeared to possibly have been on fire before the collision. However, this was likely to have been the flashing headlights of the vehicle, which was facing the train, as the driver attempted to signal to the train crew that he was ahead of them. The train was being operated at the time by a student engineer with the train engineer in the control cab with him. The truck driver is reported to have driven along the tracks having turned too early before the intersection at Fifth Street and then having gotten his wheels jammed in the tracks from which he was then unable to extricate it. The truck was 80 feet west of the intersection and facing the train when the accident occurred. There were 48 passengers and three crew on board the train. Of those, 30 were injured. Initially, 28 of the injured were taken to hospital; 20 were released and eight were admitted, four of them said to be in critical condition. Later, two more passengers were transported to hospitals and released. Victims were treated at the Community Memorial Hospital, Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center, St. John's Regional Medical Center, St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital, and Ventura County Medical Center. The truck driver, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, was ‚Äúacutely fatigued‚Äù and was unfamiliar with the area according to the final NTSB report. Sanchez-Ramirez left the scene on foot following the accident, but was later taken into custody about a mile away. According to his attorney, the man was trying to summon help in a remote part of the county without a vehicle and with no guarantee anyone he found would be able to communicate with him since he only speaks Spanish. When he finally encountered police officers, he handed them the cell phone on which he had been talking to his son so that his son could explain to the officers what had just happened to the train. He was booked on suspicion of hit and run and held on $150,000 bail, but prosecutors later declined to file criminal charges against him and he was released two days later. Sanchez was due back in court in May 2015. Aftermath BNSF 5696 pulling Metrolink in the aftermath of the derailment Metrolink trains between East Ventura and Moorpark were cancelled. A bus service was provided for passengers traveling to these stations. Local roads around the scene of the accident were closed. Amtrak Pacific Surfliner service between Los Angeles and Goleta, that uses the same Union Pacific coast line, was also cancelled. The train engineer, Glenn Steele, 62, was one of the critically injured and died one week later. After the accident, Steele experienced two cardiac arrests on Wednesday February 25, but lived after those events. At the time of his death, Steele was the most senior engineer with Metrolink, having spent half of his 42-year-long Amtrak career with Metrolink. Steele died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center early on March 3. A resident of Homeland, California, Steele was a grandfather. In March 2015, two of those injured due to the crash sued the truck driver, and his employer, Harvest Management LLC. As a result of the accident, Metrolink announced on September 3, 2015 that they would restrict use of the cab cars for at least a year as they reviewed the safety features. As a stopgap, BNSF Railway locomotives were borrowed to add a second locomotive to each train set, positioned in front of the cab car. The cab cars remained in service as passenger coaches used elsewhere in a train's lineup of cars. On February 22, 2016, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez was charged with manslaughter by Ventura County prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge in April 2019. He had a previous DUI conviction in his home state of Arizona. NTSB engineer takes measurements of wreckage Investigations NTSB Board Member Robert Sumwalt briefs media in February 2015 The National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation into the accident. A Go-team was dispatched to the scene. The train was fitted with a forward-facing camera in the cab car. The NTSB verified that the forward-facing camera was recording data and the collision itself was recorded by the camera. Although it was initially stated that the truck became stuck on the tracks, NTSB later clarified that it is unclear if the vehicle was stuck and that it was not a typical grade crossing incident where a vehicle is crossing the tracks and is stopped or struck before completing the crossing. The vehicle was not in the crossing nor between the crossing arms. The Federal Railroad Administration opened an investigation into the accident, the twelfth at the crossing in ten years. An average of eight passenger and 24 freight trains use the line in each direction each day. A preliminary report was published on March 19, 2015. In the report, it was stated that when the truck was struck, its driver-side door was open and its headlights and emergency lights were flashing. A report later that year found that the cow-catcher and a coupler on the train had manufacturing flaws, although no conclusion was reported regarding their role in the crash. On July 8, 2016, the Metrolink board approved a $1.5 million plan to repair the plows on the Hyundai Rotem cab cars. Once the repairs were completed, the cars returned to service and the leased BNSF locomotives were returned.

The two parks share an internal border and both border Shoreline Community College. Boeing Creek Park mainly consists of forested areas. Shoreview Park contains recreational facilities including tennis courts, baseball and soccer fields and an off-leash dog area. The upper portion of Boeing Creek flows along the western edge of Boeing Creek and Shoreview Park to Hidden Lake. Natural History =Flora= Boeing Creek park has a largely intact native ecosystem, mostly free of invasive species. Habitats within Boeing Creek Park consist of Conifer forest, Conifer-deciduous forest, deciduous forest, and riparian forest along Boeing Creek. The conifer forest consists Douglas-fir, Western hemlock and Western red cedar trees. There are a number of mature conifers that escaped being logged, with some tall Douglas- fir trees. Salmonberry shrubs are common along the creek. The native species of Sword fern and Stinging nettle are common. Shoreview Park habitats are Conifer-deciduous forest, Conifer-madrone forest, Grassland, Shrubland and developed areas. Twelves acres of Shoreview Park contains invasive species such as Butterfly bush, Scotch broom, Himalayan blackberry, English ivy, and Herb Robert. =Fauna= Boeing Creek and Shoreview Park contain numerous bird species. Great blue heron, Bald eagle, and Pileated woodpecker have been observed within Boeing Creek Park. Rough-skinned newt have been observed along inlets to Boeing Creek. History In 1913 William Boeing, founder of the Boeing company, had a mansion built in The Highlands neighborhood, along Boeing Creek. Boeing owned the land that includes today's Shoreview and Boeing Creek Parks. He used the land primarily as a hunting retreat and had a small dam made, creating Hidden Lake which he used as a private fishing pond. In the 1930s Boeing platted and logged north of Boeing Creek and sold the much of his land to developers. The Innis Arden neighborhood began to be developed on this land after World War II. He donated the land that makes up Shoreview Park to the Shoreline School District. In 1997, the City of Shoreline assumed ownership of both parks.

With other representatives on mission he sought to quell federalist impulses in the French provinces and to align the local Jacobin clubs with the Parisian model. As an aide to the famed Championnet he attempted the geographic and political reorganization of the Kingdom of Naples along republican lines. Biography Member of the Congregation of the Mission before 1789 and vicar of Notre Dame, he took part in the outbreak of the French Revolution. After the members of the Third Estate were locked out of the Estates-General on 20 June 1789, they met in the St. Louis district of Versailles, where he was among the first to take the Tennis Court Oath. As a juring priest, he was named to the parish of St. Louis (Versailles) on 10 April 1790; to the Executive Board of the department on 6 July 1790, and Vice President of the district in 1791. On 3 September 1791, he was elected with 299 votes out of 553 voters, as deputy of Seine-et-Oise to the Legislative Assembly, where he displayed his radical opinions. Reelected to the convention, he voted for the death without appeal or suspension, during the trial of Louis XVI. Bassal was named with Jacques Garnier de Saintes on the first mission in the Jura, the Ain, the C√¥te d'Or and Doubs by decree of 18 June 1793, to quell unrest and purify the authorities. His action in Doubs reflected the broader problems of federalism and the revolutionary agenda: as late as May 1793, neither of the two blocs of the Jacobin clubs in Doubs had identified their interests clearly with a Parisian faction. Once Bassal and his colleague Garnier arrived in Benscaon, they influenced one of the clubs to declare itself aligned with the Parisian Jacobins, \\"for the Mountain,\\" as the saying went, and acquired the mantle of power. This process repeated itself in the Jura, the Ain, and the C√¥te d'Or.Michael L. Kennedy, The Jacobin Clubs and the French Revolution, 1793-1795, Berghahn Books, 2000, p. 28. Upon his return, he was elected secretary of the meeting. Then he was sent with Charles-Jean-Marie Alquier, Bernard de Saintes and Jacques Reverchon, mission Ain, Jura, C√¥te d'Or, the Mont-Terrible and Haute-Sa√¥ne by decree of 17 August 1793, to quell the royalist uprisings there and to secure the borders with Switzerland and German states. Appointed at the beginning of Directory as a secret agent in Basel, his mission was to ensure supplies of the army of Italy and monitor those suspected of not having denounced the counter revolution in Switzerland and remained in regular correspondence with one of the leaders (known as the Master, probably William Wickham) of the royalist insurrection of 13 Vendemiaire Year IV. As secretary to the Directory's Consul in Basel, he was reported to have spied upon English agents in Switzerland.Annual Report of the American Historical Association, Letters of William Vans Murray, (7 December 1798), U.S. Government Printing Office, Smithsonian Institution, 1914, p. 491. Bassal was also charged as a government commissioner to inspect the post offices of the border with Switzerland (Huningue, Porrentruy, Besan√ßon, Pontarlier, St. Claude and Versoix). Reform of Naples In 1798, he went to Naples with Championnet. There, he sought to take charge of the reform of the departments, reorganizing the elective and governmental landscape in the French model. The Neopolitans objected to his seemingly arbitrary organizational methods.Vincenzo Cuoco, A Historical Essay on the Neapolotian Revolution of 1799, University of Toronto Press, 2014, pp. 202-203. Bassal's project threw existing hierarchies into confusion, and became an unworkable disaster. These measures were part of broader efforts taken to secure the revolution in the Kingdom of Naples along the republican lines established in France, which included guaranteeing the national debt.John A. Davis, Naples and Napoleon: Southern Italy and the European Revolutions, 1780-1860\\\\. Oxford University Press, p.p. 83 and 93. However, he was accused of causing trouble between the civilian and military commissioners and of seeking to benefit from the squander of public funds. Subsequently, he returned to Milan when Championnet was recalled to Paris. Napoleon's coup of 30 Prairial Year VII (18 June 1799) saved him from further prosecution. He retired to Paris, where he died in 1802 in obscurity.

Its date is uncertain. Description The Pentelic marble relief consists of two plates and there must have been a third piece on the left hand side, containing at least the tail of the horse. The central figure of the relief is a horse moving to the right, with its head pulled upwards away from the right edge of the relief. A portion of the horses nose is missing, the only substantial damage to the piece. Its left foreleg is raised and bent, the right is stretched out and planted firmly in the ground. The hind legs reinforce the horse's position, the left hind leg is in very low relief, only barely extending out of the surface. On the horse's back is a panther pelt, which is attached around its front. At the front, to its left, stands a stable boy who reaches up to strike the horse with a whip, as the pained posture of the horse's head makes clear. The boy wears a chiton. His hair is cut short, but the pattern of the locks indicates that he is an exotic foreigner. It is probably that he is an African slave, most likely from Ethiopia. Arabs and Africans were depicted in Greek art from the fourth century BC. In addition to this example, the , relief found in 1948 near the Larisa metro-station must date to near the end of the fourth century BC. Other datings assign the relief to the first century BC. If one takes the earlier dating it is assumed that the relief belonged to a large grave naiskos; supporters of the later dating often connect it with the funerary monument of King Mithridates VI of Pontus.

On the post-1988 orbit the comet probably does not get brighter than about apparent magnitude 21. The comet might come to perihelion in late May 2021, but the uncertainty in the comet's position is a few million km.  Discovery  The comet was discovered on a photographic plate on 16 June 1979 by Kenneth S. Russell at the UK Schmidt Telescope, Australia, who described it as faint and diffuse, with a very low brightness of magnitude 18. Calculations of its orbit suggested a perihelion date of 27 May 1979 and an orbital frequency of 6.13 years. The predicted 1985 apparition was observed by J. Gibson using the 1.5-m reflector at Palomar Observatory, California. He estimated the brightness of the nucleus at a very faint magnitude 19.5.  1988  On 9 August 1988 the comet passed from Jupiter lifting perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) from 1.6 AU to 2.1 AU. This greater distance from the Sun makes the comet fainter, less active, and more difficult to recover. Its predicted appearance in 1991 was not observed due to unfavourable conditions and it was missed again in 1998. In 2006, although conditions were favourable, the comet was not relocated and hence it is now classified as lost.  2021  In mid March 2021 the comet is expected to come to opposition in the constellation of Crater at around apparent magnitude 20.9.

It was used in several musical settings, including the chorale cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort, BWV 126.  History  Lucas Cranach d. J., 1577 Luther wrote the hymn probably in 1541 when a prayer service was held in Wittenberg against the perceived danger of the Turks when Ferdinand of Austria lost most of Hungary to the Ottoman Empire at Siege of Buda. The second line of the first verse reads \\"und steur' des Papsts und T√ºrken Mord\\" (And control the murder by the Pope and Turks). Luther may have contributed the hymn for a boys' choir. It was published as a broadsheet in 1542. In Klug's hymnal Geistliche Lieder it was titled a \\"A hymn for the children to sing against the two arch-enemies of Christ, and His Holy Church, the Pope and the Turks\\" (\\"Ein Kinderlied, zu singen wider die zween Ertzfeinde Christi und seiner heiligen Kirchen, den Bapst und T√ºrcken\\"). Luther wrote three stanzas, each one related to a person of the Trinity: \\"Erhalt uns, Herr\\", \\"Beweis dein Macht, Herr Jesu Christ\\", and \\"Gott, Heilger Geist\\". More stanzas were added in later editions, most prominently by Justus Jonas, who wrote probably in 1545, referring to the Council of Trent, two more stanzas, \\"Ihr Anschl√§g, Herr, zu nichte mach\\" and \\"So werden wir erkennen doch\\". These five stanzas appeared in Breslau in 1546 as No. 723 in Burg's hymnal. In hymnals at the time of Johann Sebastian Bach, \\"\\" this combination of five stanzas was often continued by Luther's German version of (Give peace, Lord, 1531), and a second stanza to it, as follows: # # # # # # # The sixth stanza is a prayer for peace, beginning \\"Verleih uns Frieden gn√§diglich, Herr Gott, zu unsern Zeiten\\" (Grant us peace graciously, Lord God, in our time). The seventh stanza paraphrases , beginning \\"Gib unsern F√ºrsten und all'r Obrigkeit Fried und gut Regiment\\" (Give our rulers and all lawgivers peace and good government). In modern editions of \\"\\", the line against the Pope and the Turks was replaced by a more neutral wording against God's enemies in general. In the current Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch it is EG 193.  Melody and musical settings  Johann Walter adapted the melody, Zahn No. 350, from Da pacem Domine. It appeared first in Klug's hymnal in 1543 and resembles that of \\"Verleih uns Frieden gn√§diglich\\", derived from the same source. wrote two choral settings in 1544. Dieterich Buxtehude composed a cantata, BuxWV 27, on all seven stanzas. Bach based in 1725 his chorale cantata Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort, BWV 126, on the seven combined stanzas, retaining the text of stanzas 1, 3, 6 and 7 unchanged. Ernst Pepping composed a motet for men's chorus a cappella in 1957. Chorale preludes were written by Johann Pachelbel, Georg B√∂hm, and Hugo Distler, among others. Mauricio Kagel quoted the hymn in his oratorio Sankt-Bach-Passion telling Bach's life, composed for the tricentenary of Bach's birth in 1985.

The band was popular for the straightforward rock songs and for the raunchy visual image created by photographer Mick Rock. Strapps toured with Deep Purple and Ian Gillan Band, and have recorded four albums.  Biography  Strapps came to being when drummer Mick Underwood met up with an Australian singer-guitarist Ross Stagg. The line-up was completed by bassist Joe Reed and keyboard player Noel Scott. The band went into a period of prolonged rehearsal before eventually being signed up to EMI's Harvest label, and subsequently recorded their first album at Ian Gillan's Kingsway Recorders studio in London, which was produced by Roger Glover. Glover also got the band a TV show performance at Supersonic, on 26 March 1977. Strapps were soon out on the road touring the album. Unfortunately, the band's marketing strategy did not go down equally well with everyone - publicity photographs for their eponymous album with a topless model raised the ire of some radical feminists. The women subsequently fronted up at some of their university gigs and made things pretty uncomfortable for the band. Despite this minor blaze of negative publicity, they were given the support slot on labelmate Deep Purple's final tour in the UK and Japan, gaining invaluable exposure with their target audience. The band soon hit the recording studios again, this time Island's Basing Street studios, and with producer Chris Kimsey at the helm. Secret Damage continued the already popular music formula. The cover photography for the album was still high gloss and somewhat glammy, but apart from one tiny image hidden on the inner sleeve, the subject matter consisted of less contentious material than their previous release, namely only the band members themselves. In 1977, Strapps took the support slot on the UK tour of the Ian Gillan Band. The band's success on stage, especially in Japan, did not translate into sales. Unable to sell sufficient records to appease their record company, they were dropped from the roster. However, the Far East had not forgotten the band, and they were able to strike up a new, smaller deal for distribution in Japan only. A third album, Prisoner Of Your Love, was recorded at The Manor, with Pip Williams at the helm. For the fourth and what was ultimately to be the band's final album, Ball Of Fire, the sessions took place once again at Kingsway Recorders. By then Noel Scott has left the band and instead a second guitarist, Ray McRiner, was hired. Strapps folded when Mick Underwood accepted Ian Gillan's offer to join his new band Gillan in 1979. In 2008, Angel Air Records released a live album titled Live at the Rainbow 1977, recorded at the Rainbow Theatre, London, during one show where Strapps opened for The Ian Gillan Band.

Most notably, he commanded Republican forces during the War in the Vend√©e and successfully defended Chalot from Vendean attack. He was a severe critic of his commander, Jean Antoine Rossignol, who later had him arrested and returned to Paris for trial. Accused by Jacques H√©bert, he was saved from conviction only by the fall of the H√©bertists, and the execution of H√©bert himself. He subsequently commanded the coastal defenses at Brest, and was a divisional commander in Pierre Marie Barth√©lemy Ferino's column of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle during the Rhine Campaign of 1796. After the campaign he tried several times to retire; he died of injuries from a carriage accident in Paris in 1800. Family Born on 27 August 1746 in Conteville, Somme, he was the son of a weaver, Jean Tuncq, and his wife Marie-Francoise Trogneux (or Trongneux). He married Marie-Francios Pelagie Chefeville, of Liancourt, Oise, in St. Philippe du Roule, Paris, on 26 November 1789. The couple had three children. One, Brutus, became a battalion chief by 1848.Samariens sous l'Empire, Augustin tuncq, 3 February2014 version. Accessed 25 February 2015. Military Service Tunq entered the royal army as a private in 1762, first as a volunteer in the Regiment of Provence, and was a sergeant on 1 January 1768.Alain Gerard, La Vendee: 1789‚Äì1793, Editions Champ Vallon, 1992, p. 223. He deserted on 30 June 1770, yet by 1773, he was a rider in the provost marshal's guard. When it was decommissioned on 19 October, he joined the guard of the General Provost (13 March 1774). In 1780, he became a captain in the Legion of the Pyrenees. By 1789 he was a captain in the National Guard. Service during the French Revolution 19th century representation of the Battle of Lu√ßon In June 1793, during the French Revolution, he was sent to fight in the War in the Vend√©e, where he replaced General Claude Sandoz in Lu√ßon, who had been removed for flight. Upon this appointment, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. He accused his superior, General Jean Antoine Rossignol, the commander of the Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle, of incompetence. Rossignol removed him from command, but on his day of departure, the Vend√©en insurgents attacked the city. Upon orders of the representatives on mission :fr:Jean Fran√ßois Marie Goupilleau de Fontenay and Fran√ßois Louis Bourdon then ordered him to temporarily reinstate his command. With 6,000 men, on 14 August, he defeated D‚ÄôElb√©e's superior force of 35,000 in the Battle of Lu√ßon and he subsequently held both Lu√ßon and Chantonnay.Digby Smith, The Greenhill Napoleonic Wars Data Book. Greenhill Books, 1998, p. 51. Consequently, supported by the powerful representatives, his victory earned him the rank of major general. Injured after falling off a horse, he gave up his army to his second in command, general of division Ren√© Fran√ßois Lecomte, so he could receive treatment for his injuries at La Rochelle, but on 5 September, the division was crushed by d‚ÄôElb√©e's 20,000 men at the Battle of Chantonnay. Lecomte had not taken any precautions in building the defenses and left without issuing appropriate orders. Rossignol took advantage of Lecomte's poor leadership to insure Tuncq's removal, placing him under arrest on 12 September. Sent to Paris, Tuncq vigorously defended himself before the military tribunal.See Le g√©n√©ral Tuncq √† ses concitoyens, Augustin Tuncq, l'Antifederaliste, 1793 and Le G√©n√©ral Tuncq √† ses Concitoyens. Galletti, imprimeur du Journal des lois de la R√©publique fran√ßaise, 1793. He narrowly escaped the guillotine, but was acquitted after the case against him fell apart: in early 1794, Jacques H√©bert and his colleagues fell from power and H√©bert himself was executed.William Doyle, The Oxford History of the French Revolution, Clarendon Press 1989, pp. 260‚Äì275. Tuncq was reinstated in his position in November 1794. Service in the Rhineland \\"In 1795, he was assigned to the army at Brest and took command of the 4th Division in Nantes. During this assignment, Josnet de Laviolais reported to the military authorities that he was unfit; general Hoche described him as an immoral man without integrity or talent.\\" Exonerated by a military tribunal, he was assigned to the 15th Division at Amiens, but the local authorities rejected him. He requested retirement, but was called to active duty on 4 March 1796 as a divisional commander of the second division of Ferino's Column of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle. On 7 March 1797, he was arrested on unknown charges, and acquitted by the War Council on 8 August and reintegrated into the army on 9 September 1797; he was employed by the 15th division until 21 August 1799. He died in Paris at the Hospital of Val-de-Gr√¢on on 9 February 1800, of injuries received in a riding accident. Lazare Carnot, Correspondence general de Carnot, Imprimerie nationale, 1897, vol. 3, p. 118 (fn).

He lives and works in Paris.  Early life  Although he learnt painting with grandmother Marguerite Juille and the artist L√©o Lotz, he studied science. In 1975, he entered the Institut national agronomique Paris Grignon. He painted there regularly and created with some friends the review Karamazov in 1977.√âlisabeth Couturier, ¬´ Jed Martin existe, nous l'avons rencontr√© ¬ª, Paris-Match, 3 f√©vrier 2011 He graduated in 1980 with two specialities: political economy and ecology.  Career  After one year in Algeria as a teacher, he began an engineering career at the Ministry of Agriculture, where he was in charge of an economic review. He became a mediator in industrial restructuring before teaching human resources and social issues at the Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon and at the Mines ParisTech. In 1995, he began moving from engineering to painting and began to exhibit one year later. He focused on daily life of contemporaneous men and women (vicissitudes of sexuality, couples in crisis) and particularly, life at work. He is interested in the world of executives and in the weight of managerial speeches. In 2008, he began a series of imaginary portraits, dubbed ‚Äúcurriculum vitae‚Äù, mixing painting and inscriptions gthat point out a singularity or sum up a life in a few words. He wrote his first novel in 2011, 121 curriculum vitae pour un tombeau, winning a prize at the Festival of The First Novel in Laval, and two years later, Pr√©cipitation en milieu acide. His literary texts are a continuation of his reflections about alienation at work. Lamalattie contributes to magazines (Artension, Causeur, √âcritique, etc.).

This is the first Pebble to introduce a color e-paper display, as well as a microphone, a new charging cable and a new Pebble Time-optimized operating system. In early 2015, Pebble announced the product, as well as its fundraising on Kickstarter. The watch received $1M in 49 minutes, breaking a current record, and became the most funded Kickstarter to date, reaching $20.4M all the way to its deadline, from over 78,741 backers. History =Development= After releasing the Pebble Smartwatch, Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky announced the Pebble Time, the second generation smartwatch of Pebble. =Funding= The project was established on Kickstarter, a crowdsourcing website, and reached its goal ($500K) in 17 minutes, $1M in 49 minutes, $10.3M in 2 days, breaking another Kickstarter goal, and finally earning $20.4M by its deadline on 3 March 2015, making it the most funded Kickstarter project to date. The Pebble Time Smartwatch is officially the most successful campaign on Kickstarter, with almost 80,000 backers pledging $20 million. Pebble ceased operating in June 2018, with the technology sold to Fitbit.  Features  Pebble's smartwatches connect to both Android and iOS phones, and using a Bluetooth connection, run native apps that control music on the connected smartphone, display calendars, show fitness/sleep data from Pebble Health, and allow users to set timers. Pebble also has an app store where users can download apps from companies including RunKeeper, ESPN, Uber, Nest, TripAdvisor, Pandora Radio, and Yelp onto their watches. Users can also respond to text messages with the Pebble's microphone, check the weather, create checklists, make voice notes, and view Google Maps directions. The Pebble Time in grey, showing initial screen out-of-box = Software = Pebble Time uses Pebble OS version 3.0. This OS is compatible with its color e-paper display. The OS features updated transitions between screens which \\"morph\\" into other features due to the constrained space of the watch's face. The OS version is also backward compatible with other features in previous versions of Pebble OS. It works with apps, watchfaces, and settings tailored for Pebble OS v. 2 or lower, as well as its predecessors. Pebble Time still retains most of the features from the original Pebble smartwatch, such as Bluetooth connectivity, and is currently only compatible with the smartwatch itself. Timeline is a new feature on Pebble OS 3, which currently is only compatible with Pebble Time. It enables the wearer to look at past and future notes, either reminders, alarms, app notifications, scores, weather reports or others. The completed or viewed notifications, ESPN scores, and calendar events are in the \\"past\\" section, which is highlighted yellow. The future calendar events, weather reports, or reminders are in the \\"future\\" section, which is highlighted blue. To access either, the wearer uses the buttons to look at desired information. = Hardware = The smartwatch comes with a Gorilla Glass 64-color e-paper always-on display developed by JDI with 144x168 resolution and has a pixel density of 182 ppi. This is the first Pebble smartwatch to have a color display, and still retains a LED backlight as well. The watch also has a vibrating motor for silent alarms, and smart notifications. The watch comes with a redesigned charging cable that, like its predecessor's cable, magnetically attaches itself to the watch in order to maintain its water resistance. Unlike its predecessor, the cable attaches to the back of the watch rather than the side, and has the potential to transfer data rather than just power. The band attaches with standard 22 mm pins. The watch is also equipped with an ambient light sensor and 6 axis accelerometer. =\\"Smartstraps\\"= Pebble Time, as a feature, has a small accessory port on the back of the watchface. Pebble Technology, Corp announced on its developer site that it is possible to create accessory ports on watchbands, otherwise known as \\"smartstraps\\". It enables the wearer to attach additional equipment to the watch, including sensors, batteries, and miscellaneous. As a hazard, the \\"smartstraps\\" will affect the watch's battery life. As of summer 2015, the \\"smartstrap\\" API is still in beta testing. Two smartstraps were funded on Kickstarter so far: the Pagar√© strap, which gives Apple Pay-like contactless payment features to the Pebble, and the Tylt V√º strap, which gives Qi capabilities to the Pebble, as well as heart rate measurement. Variants = Time Steel = The Pebble Time Steel is a variant of the Pebble Time, with a steel and leather style and 10-day battery life, while retaining full waterproofing and all of the Pebble Time's features. It has a Marine Grade steel chassis encasing it, with bezel and a PVD matte polishing finish, a 2.5D color e-paper display, and depending on color finish, comes with either a 22 mm Italian leather band with stainless steel PVD-coated buckles and \\"Quick Release\\" pins, or a 22 mm stainless steel band with PVD coating and detailing sold separately. The back of a Pebble Time Steel without a band‚Äîfrom Pebble's second Kickstarter = Time Round = The Pebble Time Round is a variant of the Pebble Time. It was available for pre-order on September 23, 2015. The watch includes a 2-day battery with 15 minutes of charging giving the watch one day of battery life. The watch has the same 64 color e-paper display as the other Pebble Times. It was available with two watch strap sizes: 14 mm and 20 mm with different color combinations for each size. The Pebble Time Round has all the same features as the Pebble Time, including the microphone for dictating text message replies, but featured a thinner, round style. = Time 2 = The Pebble Time 2 is the second version of the Pebble Time. It was announced via Kickstarter on May 24, 2016. The Time 2 features a larger 228x200 1.5 inch color display, an optical heart rate monitor and improvements to Pebble Health. The Time 2 has all the same features of previous Time models. The Pebble Time 2 was never publicly released due to the insolvency of Pebble. Reception =Pebble Time= Critics have praised the battery life, Android support, and color screen, but have derided its Apple support, its \\"retro-techie\\" design, and its overall quality. The Verge gave the watch a 6.8 on its score, summing up by saying that while it's fun at some points, \\"the Pebble Time doesn't do enough to change that.\\" CNET also gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars for the editor's rating, and a 7.8 overall, saying that \\"[the] Pebble Time adds a few key improvements and a color screen..., but owners of previous Pebble[s] may not see a need to upgrade yet.\\" Digital Trends gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars, praising the battery life, screen, design, and water resistance, but derided its software support, design, settings, interface, and price, saying that \\"Pebble has been left behind.\\" Tom's Guide gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, concluding that while it isn't the perfect smartwatch, \\"it's the most practical wrist companion for Android\\" Wired gave it a 6/10, and summed up its use by saying that they want the idea, \\"[but not] the watch.\\" PC Magazine gave it a 4 out of 5, stating it \\"excellent\\" and as an \\"Editor's Choice\\", saying that \\"[it's a] solid choice for first-time smartwatch buyers.\\" =Pebble Time Steel= CNET gave it 3.5 out 5 stars for the editor's rating, but a point higher compared to Pebble Time for its overall rating, stating that \\"[it's better] as a more budget-friendly watch.\\" Tom's Guide gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying that it's \\"the company's most luxurious smartwatch to date, but it's a better choice for Android users.\\" See also * Apple Watch * MetaWatch * Microsoft Band * Moto 360 * Wearable computer References  External links  * Category:Kickstarter-funded products Category:Products introduced in 2015 Category:Smartwatches Category:Watch brands ","title":"Pebble Time"},{"id":"45495556","text":"\\"'\\" is a Lutheran hymn, written in 1523 by Martin Luther.

The most important elements are the ninots, cartoon-like figures made of papier m√¢che. The Falles of Alzira are regulated by an association called Junta Local Fallera. In 1989, the first centenary of this event was celebrated; the ceremonies where presided over by the president of the Generalitat Valenciana at the time, Joan Lerma. The Falles week The Falles festivity officially begins in early March with a ceremony known as La Crid√†, and it ends with the Falles week, which is subjected to a strict schedule of events: * On the 16th of March: The Plant√†, the act of erecting the falla. This should, in any case, be finished before the visit of the jury; the time and date of this visit appears in the official program. If the falla is not finished at this time, it will be disqualified. * On the 17th of March: Awards ceremony in the town hall. * On the 18th of March: The Ofrenda, the offering of flowers to Our Lady of Lluch, the patron saint of Alzira. This is followed by a parade of fallers in the evening and into the night. * On the 19th of March: The Pasodoble. In the afternoon, all the \\"commissions\\" (groups of fallers) parade around the streets of Alzira dancing the pasodoble. A jury of the Junta Local Fallera rates the dances and awards a prize for the best dance. At night, the Crem√† is celebrated, which is the burning of the falles monuments in the streets, where they were erected. The event is preceded by fireworks, lit by the Fallera Major (the annually elected \\"first lady\\") of each group of fallers.. On the 17th, 18th and 19 March, each commission meets at eight o'clock in the morning in the casal (the commission's regular meeting venue), to celebrate the despert√†, which means walking around their neighborhood throwing firecrackers. Immediately afterwards the typical breakfast is served in each casal. Then the fallers walk through the streets and visit other casals until lunchtime. At 2 p.m., there is a fireworks display, the famous masclet√†, in the Plaza del Reino, which is watched by crowds of people. Artistic monuments The falles are usually satirical in nature, making reference to current issues. These monuments can be up to 25 or 30 metres high, and they consist of a number of papier m√¢che ninots held up by a wooden framework. However, papier m√¢che has, in recent years, occasionally been replaced by styrofoam (EPS) since it makes the falles lighter and brighter in colour. Signs written in Valencian explain the meaning of each scene in a critical or satyrical way. Many professionals such as sculptors, painters, and other craftsmen work on the construction of the falles for months. They are hired by the commissions. The falles are erected in the streets on the night of the 15th of March. This day is known as the Plant√†. In actual fact, nowadays the process of erecting the falles starts several days earlier, due to their size and the need to use cranes. The monuments are burnt on the day of the Crem√†. Sections The members of each commission chooses which \\"section\\" (group of Falles that compete with each other) they want to belong to. The aim of grouping falles in sections is to have a fair competition between monuments with a comparable artistic quality. Belonging to one section or another depends on a commission's annual declaration of its budget. No section can have more than ten monuments; if there are more than ten applicants for one section, the ten monuments with the highest budgets enter that particular section. Clothing The faller (man) should wear: * The costume typically used in Alzira since 1968: black trousers, black socks and black shoes, a short black jacket, a white shirt, a white shirt front and a sash of any color with tassels hanging over the left trouser leg. * The torrent√≠ costume. * The sarag√ºell costume. * A costume consisting of long striped trousers, a silk or linen shirt, a waistcoat, a sash, and black shoes with black socks or espadrilles with embroidered socks. * The use of ties, flowers or bows is forbidden. The fallera (woman) should wear: * The formal Valencian farmer's dress, with the fallera's hair arranged in three chignons; the fallera is expected to dress with utmost decency. * The 18th century costume, with the fallera's hair arranged in one or three chignons. * The typical regional dress of the Huerta de Valencia, with the fallera's hair arranged in one chignon. * It is not permitted to use any item of clothing or adornment that is not traditional or is not a part of the costume. The use of espadrilles is only allowed if they are lined with the same fabric as the costume. The blus√≥n (a checkered shirt) is not considered traditional Valencian clothing and its use is only permitted during strictly private celebrations of the commissions. 1\\\\. The current Fallera Major and Fallera Major Infantil (who must not be older than 14), the annually elected \\"queen\\" and \\"junior queen\\" of the entire Falles festivity, are the only participants allowed to wear the so-called \\"Alzira model\\" costume and the combs with the town's coat of arms or that of the Junta Local Fallera. 2\\\\. These provisions are enforced by the General Assembly in collaboration with a minimum of two qualified clothing consultants to make sure that the clothing used satisfies the decency requirements and respects the traditions. 3\\\\. The traditional sash with the colours of the Spanish flag is the distinctive attribute of the Falleres Majors and the Falleres Majors Infaltils, both those of the entire Falles festivity and those of each of the commissions. The members of their \\"courts of honour\\" wear a sash with the colours of the Valencian flag, with the badge and the name of the respective commission embroidered, on a white background, at the top of the blue band.

Liverpool has the United Kingdom's oldest and longest established black community, going back several generations.David Clay, \\"\\"The changing face of community participation: the Liverpool black experience\\", Participatory Learning and Action 58 (IIED), June 2008. Liverpool's black community is also unusual among those in the United Kingdom, as the Liverpool- born Black British community often constitute a category distinct from later African and Afro-Caribbean migrants.Diane Frist, Work and Community Among West African Migrant Workers Since the Nineteenth Century, Liverpool University Press, 1999, p. 188. History Dating to the 1730s, the Black community of Liverpool is Britain's oldest, with some Liverpudlians being able to trace their black heritage for as many as ten generations. The community dates back to the American Revolutionary War with Black Loyalists settling in the city. They were later followed by more African-American soldiers. The original African-American community was followed in the 19th and 20th centuries by sailors and soldiers from all over the West Indies and West Africa. The black community experienced continued growth due to the location of Liverpool as a port city. Liverpool's port attracted many servicemen and seafarers, including African Americans, Jamaicans, Trinidadians, Belizeans, Guyanese, Nigerians, Ghanaians, Gambians, and others from all over the Caribbean and Africa. Mostly settling in the Toxteth district, they joined already settled English, Irish, Welsh, Chinese and to a lesser extent Indians of seafarer or serviceman heritage. The Liverpudlian Black community became a Mixed-race community early on, with intermarriages taking place on a large scale among people with African roots, Whites and Asians. In turn most of today's Liverpudlian Blacks, even adding more recent Afro-Caribbean and African migrants, are product of a community that became a distinct multiracial community centuries ago. This process made the Liverpudlian Black community possibly the most distinct Black British community in the United Kingdom, creating a community that is native as well as unique to the country. In 2009 the black community was estimated to make up 1.9% of Liverpool's population. By 2011 the population of Liverpool was 2.8% black according to the 2011 census. Social unrest The Liverpool Black community experienced unrest early on, with race riots going back to 1919 when returned soldiers descended on the predominantly black/mixed-race areas of Toxteth.David Clay, \\"The changing face of community participation: the Liverpool black experience\\", in Tom Wakeford, Jasber Singh, Participatory Learning and Action 58, Towards Empowered Participation: Stories and Reflections (IIED), June 2008, p. 89. Infamous were the 1981 Toxteth riots, which was the direct result of long-standing tensions between the local police and the black community and that saw hundreds of police and public injured, one man dead, 500 arrested, 70 buildings destroyed and damage estimated at ¬£11m.\\"Toxteth Riots 1981 background - and how it all began\\", Liverpool Echo, 4 July 2011.

Holding a dual citizenship to compete internationally, she attained two U.S. outdoor championship titles (2002 and 2003) in the triple jump, picked up a silver medal at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and finished twenty-eighth at the 2004 Summer Olympics. During her track and field career, Perez has acquired a personal best of and each in the outdoors and indoors, respectively. Early life Born in Tucson, Arizona to Cuban immigrants, Perez spent most of her early childhood in adversity. Her father Juan Carlos Martinez Vallez was arrested upon his arrival in the United States for criminal charges, and thereby sentenced to life imprisonment in Georgia; her mother Osmayda P√©rez was killed by a stray bullet under obscure circumstances in a neighborhood shooting in San Diego, California. Following her mother's untimely demise, Perez and her two younger brothers bounced around homes for a couple of years, before being sent back to Havana, Cuba, to live with their paternal grandmother. While residing in Cuba throughout her childhood and teenage years, Perez developed herself into one of the country's most promising young athletes, taking three high school championship titles and a silver medal in the triple jump from the 1997 Junior Pan American Games. In late 1999, Perez dropped from the Cuban sports program after she refused to forego her American citizenship in exchange for the possible trip to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as part of the Cuban squad. Upon her arrival to the United States in early 2000 with just a backpack full of clothes and a reservation at a foster home, Perez left herself meager, jobless, and inarticulate in English, until she was befriended by social worker Cruz Olivarria, who invited to live with her in downtown Tucson. Working initially as a waitress, Perez restarted her athletic career through a series of radiant gestures from strangers that quickly helped her enroll on a sports scholarship at Pima Community College. Career While studying at Pima and competing for the Aztecs, Perez blossomed her freshman season by recording the team's longest triple jump at , eight inches farther than her personal best in Cuba. In 2001, Perez quickly loomed into the national scene at the USA Outdoor Championships in Eugene, Oregon, where she surged past the U.S. record holder and 1996 Olympian Sheila Hudson with a remarkable leap of , to finish second in the triple jump but lost to Tiombe Hurd by two inches and a quarter. On that same year, Perez had a golden opportunity to represent the United States on her international debut at the 2001 Summer Universiade in Beijing, China, where she nearly missed out the podium with a fourth-place finish in the same event. At the 2002 U.S. Championships in Palo Alto, California, Perez slammed her first ever title with a wind-aided jump of , surpassing the 14-meter barrier and edging out runner-up Vanitta Kinard by a few inches. As the 2003 season had commenced, Perez exhausted her eligibility at Pima upon receiving her undergraduate college degree, and then transferred to the University of Arizona to train full-time with head coach Fred Harvey for the Arizona Wildcats. In June 2003, Perez managed to defend her title at the U.S. Outdoor Championships with an upgraded personal best of , moving her up to the top 20 in the world and securing her a spot on the U.S. track and field team for the World Championships and Pan American Games. Two months later, Perez did not reach the final round of the women's triple jump at the IAAF World Championships in Paris, France, but redeemed her strength to capture the silver medal at the Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic with a jump of 13.99 metres. Perez entered the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens on her official debut, as a member of the U.S. Olympic track and field team, in the women's triple jump. Two months before the Games, she initially finished sixth at the Olympic Trials in Sacramento, California, but retained a permanent spot on the U.S. team by having achieved the Olympic A-standard of from the 2003 U.S. Outdoor Championships. Perez got off to a rough start with a foul on her opening attempt but managed to jump 13.62 m as a top qualifying mark on her second attempt. Since her third jump was slightly shorter than her best result by eleven centimeters, Perez ended up in twenty-eighth place out of thirty- three athletes and did not advance past the qualifying round. Outside of her college track and field career, Perez also trained for Tucson Elite Athletic Club under legendary coach Dick Booth.

He was also lecturer at Sciences Po, Paris, from 1993-2003.  Research Themes  Foisneau wrote his doctoral thesis on the notion of the absolute power of God in Thomas Hobbes' political theory, notwithstanding Hobbes' reputation as a renowned atheist. Foisneau analysed this under- explored conception of power in relation to the fundamental moral and political principles underpinning Leviathan.Quoted in John Dunn, ¬´ The Significance of Hobbes‚Äôs conception of power ¬ª, Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, Vol. 13, Nos. 2‚Äì3, June‚ÄìSeptember 2010, 417‚Äì433 In 2001 he was awarded the Prix de l'association des professeurs et ma√Ætres de conf√©rences de Sciences Po, Paris.

Pothuwila is located at an altitude of above sea level and is surrounded by coconut plantations, paddy fields and chena cultivation. The village got its name due to the nearby lake called \\"Pothuwila\\". Geography and climate =Geography= Topographically Pothuwila village is based on a plain area with the exception of the surrounding rock outcrops. The northern part of the town is slightly higher than the south. The Pothuwila Lake is the primary geographical feature of Pothuwila. The region comprising the Pothuwila village is located well above the sea level compared to the coastal areas of Sri Lanka. However, the region is not as high as the central hill country of the island. The nearest beaches to Pothuwila are to the western coastal areas and include Negombo and Chilaw. =Climate= Pothuwila features a tropical rainforest climate. The village's climate is tropical and hot all throughout the year. During the month of April the temperature can rise up to about . The only major change in the Pothuwila weather occurs during the monsoons from May to August and October to January, this is the time of year where heavy rains can be expected. While the city does experience a noticeably drier weather during January and February, it does not qualify as a true dry season as average precipitation in both months are above . In general, temperatures from late November to mid February period are lower than the rest of the year. The average annual rainfall in Pothuwila is about .

Credit: Wellcome Library William Cockburn M.D. (1669‚Äì1739) was a Scottish physician, known for his dysentery remedy and as Jonathan Swift's doctor. Life Cockburn proceeded M.A. at the University of Edinburgh. His name occurs in the register of the University of Leyden as a student of medicine on 29 May 1691, and there heard the lectures of Archibald Pitcairne, a continuing influence on his writings. On 2 April 1694 he became a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London, and about the same time was appointed physician to the Blue squadron of the fleet. Through his connection with the fleet Cockburn was able to introduce his secret remedy for dysentery, which made his fortune. One account givenPamphlet on a Medicine against Looseness, by La Touche, 1757 is that in July 1696 he was dining on board one of the ships in the company of Lord Berkeley of Stratton, when it was remarked to him that \\"there was nothing farther wanting but a better method of curing fluxes\\". Cockburn replied that he thought he could be of use. A trial was made next day on 70 patients on board , and proved successful. The result was reported to the admiralty board by Sir Clowdisley Shovell, who was directed to purchase a quantity of the electuary for the use of the Mediterranean squadron. Cockburn supplied the fleet with his electuary for 40 years. The date of Cockburn's moving in London as a physician is not known exactly. He had a large private practice, and in 1731 became physician to Greenwich Hospital. When Jonathan Swift came to London in September 1710, on his three years' visit chronicled in the Journal to Stella, the first of his recorded dinners was with Cockburn. Although Swift preferred the society of other doctors‚ÄîJohn Arbuthnot, John Freind, and Samuel Garth‚Äîhe chose Cockburn as his medical adviser. Cockburn died in November 1739, aged 70, and was buried in the middle aisle of Westminster Abbey. Works Dedication of ≈íconomia Corporis Animalis (1695) by William Cockburn Cockburn's first book, ≈íconomia Corporis Animalis, was published in 1695. It was a sort of scheme of general pathology, or first principles of physic, showed the influence of Pitcairne's mechanistic theories, and was dedicated to William Bridgeman of the Admiralty. The context was an absence of maritime health literature. In 1696 he brought out a small work on the Nature and Cure of Distempers of Seafaring People, with Observations on the Diet of Seamen in H.M.'s Navy, a record of his two years' experience as ship's doctor on the home station. Other writings were on venereal diseases: Lues venerea, and on the Symptoms, Nature, and Cure of a Gonorrhoea (four editions, and was translated). In the same class of writings was his Account of the Nature and Cure of Looseness, 2nd ed. 1710. In 1699 Cockburn contributed a paper on the \\"Operation of a Blister\\" to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, of which he became fellow. His other writings were pamphlets related to his secret remedy. One of these, The Present Uncertainty in the Knowledge of Medicines, 1703, was a letter to the physicians in the commission for sick and wounded seamen, in which he reproves their narrowness of view. Another on The Danger of Improving Physick (1730) was against physician opponents, particularly to Freind who had turned against him in his History of Physick (1725) after being on good terms for twenty years. Cockburn translated the De morbis acutis infantum of Walter Harris into English, published in 1693. Family Cockburn was twice married: first, in 1698, to Mary de Baudisson, a widow, who died on 6 July 1728, aged 64; and again on 5 April 1729 to Lady Mary Fielding, eldest daughter of Basil Feilding, 4th Earl of Denbigh, a patient. A contemporary account of the courtship was that he found her in tears at the prospect of having to leave London for financial reasons, and said, \\"Madam, if fifty thousand pounds and the heart of an old man will console you, they are at your service\\".

The path opened in the week of 21 October 2014, and was designed by a consortium of organizations, which built the pathway in Krommenie, Netherlands. The path was formally opened in November 2014 by the Dutch Minister of Energy Henk Kamp. Consortium The technology was developed by a consortium consisting of Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), Imtech (Dynniq) and Ooms Civiel, with a grant of ‚Ç¨1.5million from the province (county) North Holland as owner of the path. The total cost of the pilot project was ‚Ç¨3.5million. In addition to the ‚Ç¨1.5million from the province North Holland were that contributions from TNO, Ooms Civil, Imtech (Dynniq) and the European PV-Sin project (partly subsidized by the Dutch government). Technology The road surface consists of prefabricated panels with a surface of thick hardened glass. Beneath the glass solar cells are installed. TNO states that this energy can be used for lighting of the road, traffic lights and road signs. The energy is also delivered to local dwellings. TNO thinks in future electrical vehicles might be driven by the road itself. This prototype will be studied over the next three years. Problems and critics On 26 December 2014, a section of the top-layer coating detached from the glass layer, and that portion of the bike path had to be repaired. In October 2015 the top-layer coating was in such poor condition that it was replaced. Critics of the technology see several problems: *The panels might get dirty, because they are lying flat. Mud, snow, etc. might accumulate on the surface. *The panels cannot be tilted for highest efficiency, which can be done in a roof installation. *Cyclists will block the sunlight when passing. *The costs are considered high (3‚Äì4 times solar panels on a roof and a conventional pavement layer; about $1000‚Äì1400 per )($90‚Äì125 sqft). This will result in a payback time of over 50 years. *With a price of $1,200 per sqm, a yield of 70 kWh per sqm / year and a lifetime of 20 years a kWh price of $0.86 can be calculated. Compared to an offshore windfarm the cost are 4x higher (average kWh price $0.19). As comparison conventional electricity costs are around $0.05 per kWh. *High costs for grid connection, which has to be (over) dimensioned for peak loads only in the summer. *Total environmental impact during the lifetime (LCA) is expected to be negative, because of the negative contribution of the reinforced concrete slabs and the epoxy top coating layer in combination with the relatively small amount of produced electricity. *SolaRoad could put environmental progress in the slow lane, because of the high costs of this invention. Results of trial In the first month, the path delivered enough energy to sustain one family. After a six-month test engineers report results are \\"better than expected\\". \\"If we translate this to an annual yield, we expect more than the 70kWh per square metre per year,\\" Sten de Wit, spokesman for SolaRoad, the company that put it in. The EEVblog compared the 6 and 12 months trial results from SolaRoad with data from 3 rooftop solar systems within a few kilometers of the prototype road. The data showed that rooftop solar systems produced twice the output of the SolaRoad per square meter over the same period. In November 2015 it was announced that the path had produced 9800 kWh of electricity in one year. In October 2016, the path was expanded with 7 new improved elements. Two elements of the first generation were removed. In total the expanded path consist of 32 elements (83 meters). In February 2017, a crack appeared in the top coating of one of the improved elements.  Trials heavy traffic  As a follow-up to the bicycle path in Krommenie, two heavy traffic pilots were constructed early March 2019 (100 meter in Spijkenisse and 50 meter in Haarlemermeer). After a week, these pilots were closed to traffic due to problems with the top layer. In July 2019 it was decided to stop the project in Spijkenisse, the Solaroad is beyond repair. Comparable initiatives * Solar Roadways * Wattway * Smart highway An innovative cycle lane in South Korea has a solar powered roof, providing shelter from sun and rain for cyclists while generating electricity. In this concept the solar panels are directed in the most profitable position for optimal efficiency. The 32 km (20 mile) path between Daejeon and Sejong runs down the middle of a six-lane motorway. Parking under a solar panel roof is an efficient way to produce electricity in combination with infrastructure. Another economically viable solution for harvesting energy from roads is Road Energy Systems (RES). This system is based on solar water heating and could easily be placed in a road without changing its appearance.http://www.materialedge.co.uk/docs/Energy%20from%20Asphalt%20paper%2020%2011%2006.pdf References Category:Photovoltaics Category:Emerging technologies Category:Cycleways in the Netherlands Category:2014 establishments Category:Zaanstad ","title":"SolaRoad"},{"id":"45495887","text":"Trigonoptera is a genus of longhorn beetles of the subfamily Lamiinae,Biolib.cz - Trigonoptera.

Low page 16 Dundurn. Retrieved February 2015 The Nascaupee and George River system were first accurately mapped by her in 1905. She was the wife of Leonidas Hubbard who was famous for his ill-fated expedition to Labrador in 1903.  Early life  Mina Adelaine Benson was born on an apple farm near Bewdley, Ontario. Her father was James Benson, an Irish immigrant, and her mother was Jane Wood, from England. She was the seventh of eight children and received a primary education in the village school before teaching in Cobourg for two years.Bouchard, S. & Verdon, R (2009) Mina Hubbard: Remarkable forgotten Retrieved December 2009 After graduating as a nurse in 1899 from the Brooklyn Training School for Nurses,, she went to work in a small hospital in Staten Island, New York, United States. In 1900, she nursed the journalist Leonidas Hubbard whilst he was hospitalized with typhus. They married on January 31, 1901. Expedition Following her husband's ill- fated expedition to Labrador in 1903, Hubbard asked a surviving member of the party, Dillon Wallace, to record the experience as a memorial to her husband. His published book, Lure of the Labrador Wild was a commercial success in America, but Hubbard was not satisfied, coming to believe that Wallace was responsible for the death of her husband, and that her husband's reputation had been blemished by Wallace's book. In 1905, whilst Wallace was planning to mount a new expedition to complete the goal of 1903, Hubbard put together a team of her own to do the same thing in a bid to clear her husband's name. Consisting of the same George Elson who had been on the earlier expedition, along with two Cree Indians who had taken part in the unsuccessful rescue attempt in 1903, Hubbards team left Northwest River on June 27, the same day as the Wallace expedition. The press branded it a race and it received considerable attention in the news. The two parties never communicated before or during the expedition. The 576 mile trip was an efficient, well organised trek through the Labrador wilderness, completed on schedule, despite weather delays at the beginning of August when they reached the watershed at Lake Michikamau. The expedition arrived at the George River post on Ungava Bay on 29 August, some seven weeks before Wallace.Wendy Roy (2005) Maps of Difference: Canada, Women, and Travel page 91 McGill-Queen's Press Retrieved February 2015 In 43 days of travelling, the Hubbard expedition confirmed that the Nascaupee, Seal Lake and Lake Michikamau were in the same drainage basin, and that the Northwest River and the Nascaupee were in fact the same. In addition, Hubbard made extensive notes on the topography, geology, flora and fauna of this unknown wilderness. She named the source of the George River, Lake Hubbard after her husband.Wendy Roy (2005) Maps of Difference: Canada, Women, and Travel page 94 McGill-Queen's Press Retrieved February 2015 Her book, A Woman's Way Through Unknown Labrador, and her diaries provide descriptions of her encounters with the Naskapi and Montagnais Indians, and of the last great herds of Labrador's caribou. Later life The Wabe, Redington Road, Hampstead, London NW3 After the trip Hubbard carried out a lecture tour of England, where, in 1908, she met and married Harold Ellis, a businessman and the son of John Ellis, MP and his wife Maria. The couple lived at Wrea Head Hall at first, but in 1913, they purchased The Wabe, a large detached house in Hampstead, London, from its designer and original owner, the academic and mathematician William Garnett. Together they had three children, but divorced in 1926. She returned to Canada in 1936 to accompany George Elson on a canoe trip down the Moose River in northern Ontario.

The observation that short-necked and long-tailed birds flying overhead caused alarm was noted by Oskar Heinroth. Friedrich Goethe conducted experiments with silhouettes to examine alarm reactions in 1937 and a more systematic study was conducted in the same year by Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen which is considered one of the classic experiments of ethology. One of the goose/hawk models as reported by Tinbergen. Moving it from right to left (in the direction of dashed arrow) produced no response, but moving it from left to right (in the direction of solid arrow) elicited the behavior. As part of their introducing experimentalism into animal behavior research they performed experiments in which they made 2-dimensional silhouettes of various bird-like shapes and moved them across the young birds' line of vision. Goose- like shapes were ignored while hawk-like shapes produced the response. Later Tinbergen reported that a single shape that was sort of an abstract composite of the hawk and goose sillhouettes could produce the effect if moved in one direction but not the other. A study later confirmed that perception of an object was influenced by the direction of motion because the object in question was considered to be moving forwards in that direction. Initially thought to be an inborn instinct developed from natural selection, it was subsequently shown by others to be socially reinforced by other birds.  The Direction of Movement Determines Hawk or Goose  Just like what is seen in Tinbergen‚Äôs 1951 experiment the same figure is used to represent both the hawk and the goose in most hawk/goose experiments. When moving the figure in one direction, it represents a shape resembling a hawk (short neck long tail) while moving the figure in the opposite direction resembles a goose (long neck short tail). The perceived identity influences how the figure is perceived to move, such that the figure is assumed to be a hawk or a goose based on the movement in direction of the head and the protrusion of the wings (short on one end and a long one on the other).  Innate or learned behaviour  A Brief History Pointing to Innate Behavior Friedrich Goethe was the first to perform experiments using silhouettes (1937, 1940). He found that naive Capercaillie exhibited a greater fear response to a silhouette of a hawk than to a circle, a triangle, or a generalized bird silhouette, but that this varied with both species, and prior experience. Tinbergen, in 1951, pointed out that he was inspired by Oscar Heinroth's observations in which he stated that domestic chickens are more alarmed by short necked birds, over long necks ones. This provoked Konrad Lorenz's and Nikolaas Tinbergen's to design and explore the Hawk/Goose effect. Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen worked together in 1937 on experiments that were each published separately in 1939. Lorenz and Tinbergen reported differences in their experiments with Lorenz arguing that a short neck only elicits a flight response in turkeys, while Tinbergen claimed: ‚ÄúThe reactions of young gallinaceous birds, ducks, and geese to a flying bird of prey are released by the sign-stimulus ‚Äòshort neck‚Äô among others‚Äù. Tinbergen published 2 papers in 1948 on the subject. In 1951 Tinbergen continued to report on what he described as innate behavior and stated that goslings display a fear response when an ambiguous goose-hawk figure was moved in the \\"hawk\\" direction, implying that goslings associate a particular shape with a particular direction of motion. There have been a number of other studies supporting Tinbergen's short neck hypothesis with some as recent as the 1980s such as Helmut C. Mueller and Patricia G. Parker, in 1980, demonstrated that naive mallard ducklings shows a greater variance in heart rate to the hawk models over the goose models. They concluded that cardiac response is an excellent measurement of fear and controlled for learned behavior by maintaining the ducklings in a brooder until they were transported to their laboratory in opaque containers and in 1982, Elizabeth L. Moore and Helmut C. Mueller found that a chick's heart rate was of greater variance in response to the hawk model without prior, pertinent experience, suggesting a greater innate fear response to the hawk over the goose. Obvious behavioral responses to fear were not identified. Most ethologists today believe that the behaviors elicited by the hawk/goose modals are socially reinforced or are more likely to support the Schleit's ‚Äúselective habituation hypothesis\\". A Brief History Pointing to Learned Behavior After discrepancies between the results of Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen, Hirsch et al. in 1955, concluded that Tinbergen's hypothesis could not be replicated in Leghorn Chickens In 1960, McNiven, concluded that Tinbergen's hypothesis could not be replicated in ducklings and in an attempt to replicate Tinbergen's experiments, Schleit's, in 1961 believed Tinbergen falsified his data. Like the experiments that still support Tinbergan's short neck hypothesis, there are many experiments that do not  Controversy  Konrad Lorenz met Nikolaas Tinbergen in 1936 at the Leiden Instinct Symposium. In 1937, Tinbergen and Lorenz worked on two projects, an experimental analysis of egg-rolling behavior in the greylag goose, supporting the fixed action pattern hypothesis, and the responses of various young birds to cardboard models of raptors and other flying birds. Based on Oscar Heinroth‚Äôs hypothesis that domestic chickens showed the greatest amount of fear towards long tailed, short necked birds flying overhead, Tinbergen and Lorenz designed silhouettes that could represent a hawk like figure if moved in one direction, or a goose like figure if moved in the other direction. Tinbergen and Lorenz moved the models overhead of varies species of birds and recorded their responses. Tinbergen believed that these experiments prove Heinroth‚Äôs hypothesis but Lorenz noted that the shape of the model did not seem to matter for all species except turkeys. Lorenz pointed out that all other species presented alarm responses (fixating, alarm calling and marching off to cover), regardless of the model used and that ‚Äúslow relative speed‚Äù of a flying object can elicit an anti- predator response. Lorenz and Tinbergen published their original findings separately in 1939. Re-examination of the experiments were invoked due to the differences in results. In 1955, Hirsch et al. presented that Tinbergen's hypothesis could not be replicated in Leghorn Chickens. Schleidt, in 1961 did his best to replicate Tinbergen‚Äôs experiments using, free-ranging geese, ducks, and turkeys and found that regardless of the shape, these birds presented a fear response that diminished over a number of trials, pointing to the likelihood of habituation. Schleidt did find evidence to support Lorenz‚Äôs ‚Äúslow relative speed‚Äù findings. A second experiment was performed by Schleidt in 1961 to determine if turkeys, who have never been exposed to a flying object, would support Tinbergen‚Äôs predisposition hypothesis and present a fear response to the hawk-shaped object in the hawk/goose model. Schleidt used 5 bronze turkeys that were raised indoors with no windows. Schleidt‚Äôs results again, supported the ‚Äúselective habituation hypothesis,‚Äù and not innate behavior. Thus, the short neck hypothesis appears to have been falsified by Tinbergen.

To the south rock faces up to 1,000 metres drop into the valley of the Salzach, whilst its northern side descends relatively gently over a broad plateau into the barren Pitschenberg valley where the Leopold Happisch Haus is located.  Location  The Raucheck rises in the southwest of the Tennen range east of the Lehnender Stein and west of the Werfener Hochthron on the edge of the extensive karst plateau. From its highest point with its summit cross there is an outstanding panorama, with particularly good views of the Hochk√∂nig opposite, the rest of the Berchtesgaden Alps and the High Tauern mountains to the south (for example the Ankogel). Of note is that the height difference in crossing from the Raucheck to the Werfen on the opposite side of the Salzach valley is 1,900 metres. Due to its location and the gently sloping plateau the summit is popular with paragliders for intermediate landings and take-offs.  Routes  Like most of the other mountains in the Tennen, the Raucheck is easy to ascend and does not demand any climbing. An ascent does require sure-footedness and a head for heights, however, as well as good fitness and Alpine experience. Unexpected dangers, such as becoming disoriented in fog or sudden storms, make the Tennen Mountains an area respected by mountaineers. Even on a clear summer's day, the Raucheck is not usually busy, although there are several huts in the vicinity. The most important routes are: * From the Wengerau, time: five hours, height difference: 1,500 metres A rural and highly recommended route that begins in the Wengerau near Werfenweng. The ascent runs through the Elmaualm initially to the Werfener Hut. It makes sense to overnight here and attempt the hard climb the next day up the Thronleiter and the Throntal valley to the plateau. A short detour to the Edelwei√üer Hut is possible. Heading past the Hiefler the route finally approaches the summit of the Raucheck from the north. It is waymarked throughout and protected in the Throntal (UIAA grade I) with iron ladders and wire ropes. * From Mahdegg, time: four hours, height difference: 1,300 metres The shortest and classic route, which is frequently steep and demanding, begins at the Unterholzbauern just below the Mahdegg-Alm. It runs via the Eiskeller and Fieberhornkar cirque to the Griesscharte saddle and continues up to the plateau. It then joins the route described above. * From the Eisriesenwelt, time: four hours, height difference: 900 metres The easiest route in terms of height difference, but the most challenging in terms of difficulty. From Dr. Friedrich Oedl Haus near the Eisriesenwelt it runs up the Hochkogelsteig (UIAA grade II, but protected) to a hunting hut on the plateau. Then continues right (not down to the Leopold Happisch Haus) and along a long ridge past the Lehnender Stein and finally climbing to the top of the Raucheck from the north. Waymarked throughout and protected at difficult sections.  References   Literature * Albert Precht Tennengebirge, Alpine Club Guide, Bergverlag Rudolf Rother, Munich, 1986.

In regard to the last, the novel in particular takes up and expands the theme of American prisoners of war being brainwashed in Communist China and their loyalties reversed ‚Äì a theme made famous through the novel The Manchurian Candidate and film made on its basis. The book was re-published in 2011, along with other earlier works of Glen Cook. Plot summary The book has three distinct plot lines, set out in alternating chapters, and weaving back and forth in time. The reader, sharing the various points of view of the alternating characters, is in effect omniscient, knowing many things which are a mystery to the characters themselves. =First plot line (\\"The Y Axis\\")= The main plot line centers on Norman Cash, a middle aged police detective sergeant at St. Louis, Missouri and his younger partner John Harald. On 3 March 1975, the police is perplexed at finding a body on a snowbound street. The man had died of unclear causes, cannot be identified or accounted for by any investigation, is not on file anywhere and carried nothing on his body except for a handful of American coins from the early 20th Century ‚Äì the latest being a 1921 coin in mint condition. The body was found near the home of an old lady of Central European origin named Fiala Groloch, who politely receives the police in her old-fashioned parlor, offering them tea. There is no evidence against her but Cash still feels suspicious ‚Äì especially when records show the woman to be incredibly old, having lived in the same house continually since 1869. Also, old police records show that in 1921 a small- time criminal named Jack O'Brian disappeared mysteriously on the same spot; the police at the time suspected Groloch of killing him ‚Äì since he had been her lover and badly abused her ‚Äì but were never able to find the body. Some witnesses are found to testify that the body found in 1975 does strongly resemble the Jack O'Brian who disappeared in 1921. However, in order to link the two cases it must be assumed that time travel exists, a conclusion Cash's commander shies away from, for fear of being ridiculed should the story leak to the media, and Cash is ordered to take up other cases. At the time, the fall of South Vietnam hits Cash hard, reviving the trauma of his soldier son Michael having gone missing in action in Vietnam back in 1967 and no certain information of his fate ever being found out. It increases the tie between Cash and his partner John, Michael's childhood friend who had been with him in Vietnam on the day he was lost. After some time, Cash takes up the Groloch investigation again, and from a rather \\"loony\\" affair it becomes deadly serious and grim: evidence is discovered that at various times people who went into the old lady's house disappeared without a trace, including several armed gangsters; then Cash's partner John also disappears when attempting an unauthorized search of the house; when police raid the house in force, they find the old lady gone, and mysterious machinery hidden in the basement turns out to be bobby-trapped, exploding and causing more police casualties; then in another part of the town, the house of a doctor ‚Äì also a refugee from Europe ‚Äì burns and mysterious bodies are found in the wreckage ‚Äì which seems somehow tied to the Groloch affair; and the CIA turns out to have a considerable interest in all these doings... Cash, now bitterly determined to settle accounts with the sinister Groloch, has one ace left up his sleeve: he knows of another Groloch who had been living for a century at Rochester, New York, assumes that the fugitive woman went there, and sets out in pursuit. =Second plot line (\\"The X Axis\\")= In a dystopian 2058, the world is in the grip of a totalitarian State in which Czechs are the top dogs, and the center of power is the fearsome headquarters of the Agency for State Security at Prague. The State's virtually invincible weapon is the Tachyon Displacement Data Transfer System by which the Agency can send messages into the past, warn itself of coming threats and take action to eliminate them. The system is tended by the brilliant Zumsteg brothers, Otho and Stephan, who are honest in their way and completely devoted to the State. But the psychotic Colonel Neulist, consumed with jealousy of the Zumstegs and angry because Otho's daughter Marda rejected his advances, bursts into the chamber and starts wildly shooting ‚Äì causing the Tachyon system to explode. Everybody's physical bodies are destroyed, but the personalities of both the Zumstegs and their foe Neulist are hurled into the past. The three Zumstegs find themselves in 1866, inhabiting the bodies of peasants in the then obscure village of Lidice; few people show an interest in the doings of these peasants while the great Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz is fought some kilometers away. Knowing that Neulist might eventually appear in the past, the Zumstegs take the name of Groloch. In possession of advanced medical knowledge which can extend human lifespan to two hundred years and more, they decide to take the slow road back to their own time. Two of them cross the Atlantic and hole up in America, patiently waiting for the 21st Century and for their beloved State to arise ‚Äì Marda Zumsteg/Fiala Groloch in St. Louis, and her uncle Stephan, as Fian Groloch, in Rochester. The third, Otho Zumsteg/Fial Groloch, remains in Bohemia, taking up residence in the village of Lidice. However, the vengeful Neulist does appear eventually and gets on his tracks. In 1942, it is the nefarious Neulist who manipulates the Nazi occupiers to destroy Lidice, causing one of the most notorious atrocities of World War II to be perpetrated just in order that his hated rival be among the victims. After the war, Neulist goes to America to settle accounts with the other two Zumstegs. He eventually gets on the trace in St. Louis, and is behind some of the sinister events which perplexed Sergeant Cash. When Fiala Groloch flees to Rochester, Neulist is also in hot pursuit of her. =Third plot line (\\"The Z Axis\\")= In Beijing, the genius psychologist and spy master Huang Hua had spent decades secretly improving the methods of brainwashing which had not worked out in the Korean War. With the outbreak of the Vietnam War, the Chinese get their North Vietnamese allies to secretly deliver some American prisoners to Huang's installation in the Gobi Desert. Among these prisoners, considered MIA's in the US, is Sergeant Cash's son Michael Cash. Huang's techniques work on him and he becomes an ardent Maoist, committed to overthrowing American Imperialism and dreaming of himself becoming the American Mao. Huang decides to keep him and a few other Americans in China, while other brainwashed prisoners are sent back to Vietnam and eventually repatriated ‚Äì to act as Chinese sleeper agents in the US. Michael Cash rises high within the Chinese espionage system. Still, he remains flawed from Huang's point of view, being still motivated by personal feelings and not having achieved the requisite complete ruthlessness. In particular, he retains his friendship with a fellow-prisoner, Sergeant A.O.\\"Snake\\" Cantrell. A fierce individualist resisting all authority, Capitalist or Communist alike, Cantrell proved immune to even the worse which Huang could do. He was destined to be sent to hard labor and die unknown in China ‚Äì but Michael Cash connives at letting him join the repatriated prisoners, carrying back his knowledge of the Chinese brainwashing program. An observant journalist suspects that the returning POW's had been brainwashed and talks to Cantrell ‚Äì but Cantrell refuses to be involved in anti-Communist propaganda, either, eventually ending up as a rock guitar player in Britain. Still, some editorials in the US point to the possibility of brainwashing, and Huang discovers the source of the leak. Meanwhile, Michael Cash had been sent to Prague, to establish Chinese contacts with dissenting elements in the local Communist Party towards an eventual showdown between China and the USSR. He succeeds in the mission ‚Äì but has also fallen deeply in love with his Czech Communist contact person, a woman named Ilse, left her bearing his child, and dreams hopelessly of building a life with her. However, Huang ‚Äì far from open to his agent's romantic dreams ‚Äì is furious at discovering Cash's having let Cantrell get away and endanger the entire program. Michael Cash is sternly ordered to \\"correct his egoistic mistake\\" and himself go to Britain and assassinate his friend. Cash ‚Äì knowing that refusal would lead to his liquidation and that Cantrell would then be killed anyway by another Chinese agent ‚Äì goes through with shooting Cantrell by sniper rifle during a performance. However, he vows revenge on Huang, who had forced him into this \\"act of cannibalism\\". =Convegence of plot lines= The book's diverging plot lines come together with the explosive showdown at Rochester. Detective Cash catches up with the fugitive Grolochs, but their nemesis Neulist also comes on the scene. In the confrontation Norman Cash learns that his son Michael is still alive and is in China. Neulist fatally shoots the Grolochs and escapes. Before dying, Fiala Groloch ‚Äì of whom Cash thought as an ancient old lady ‚Äì reveals to Cash that in fact she is his great-granddaughter from the 21st Century, and that his son Michael was her grandfather. Michael Cash is destined to be one of the major figures of human history, as influential in the second half of the 20th Century as Hitler was in its first half. When the Chinese and Russians embark on an all-out confrontation and smash each other up, Michael Cash would escape to Prague and ‚Äì along with his Czech beloved, Ilse Zumsteg ‚Äì would forge a new power hub centered on the Czech capital, becoming a world dictator of unprecedented power. Having been given this shattering information, the shaken father Norman Cash is now in a position to change the course of history. He could still avert this entire future and redeem his lost son.

History and background  In 1992, the economist and the physicist Hans-Peter D√ºrr gave a joint talk at a conference of Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik (VfS) on the topic of ‚Äúeconomics and nature‚Äù.. See also the online version (PDF) and the preliminary remark. During the discussion, it turned out that the point of view presented had no backing among the attendees of VfS, and Busch-L√ºty and colleagues decided to establish an independent society. Busch-L√ºty initiated in 1996 the establishment of V√ñ√ñ as part of a small, interdisciplinary group of scientists as a German-speaking section of International Society for Ecological Economics (ISEE).Gr√ºndung einer Vereinigung f√ºr √ñkologische √ñkonomie im deutschsprachigen Raum: Call for Members.

Accessed February 25, 2015 The local mayor and former Member of the European Parliament acted as a patron of the constitutive conference in April 1996 in Heidelberg. The 50 scientists present shared the belief that the calls of Rio Earth Summit 1992 for establishing a sustainable development are legitimate and need to be realized.V√ñ√ñ: Wir √ºber uns, Leitbild, accessed February 25, 2015. Based on the insight that economic growth would be the wrong answer to persistent ecological problems, the scientists wanted to act strategically to alter the academic landscape.  Positions  The society argues that the economic sciences are overcharged with the necessary transformation and claims, that other scientific fields, politics open to change and the cultural forces of the society as a whole are necessary to implement and shape the change assumed necessary. Since the beginning, V√ñ√ñ emphasized the necessity of a transdisciplinary approach..

Following a reorientation in 2010, the society promotes a post-growth economy based on the concepts of Niko Paech and others. The concept of sustainable growth is considered to be an oxymoron, and the importance of eco-efficiency, consistency and eco- sufficiency is emphasized.

Mission All For One is dedicated to producing and developing extraordinary solo theater, and to creating opportunities for solo artists to enjoy sustaining careers. Since 2011, All For One Theater has presented over 50 acclaimed full-length solo plays off-Broadway. History In 2011, All For One (also known as AFO) was founded by producer Michael Wolk as an annual solo theater festival. AFO presented the first of three annual festivals of solo theater that year, offering professional development workshops and providing free panels addressing concerns in the solo show community. The festivals presented a range of solo show artists, including work directed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett, BD Wong, Colman Domingo, a world premiere by Deb Margolin, and the New York premiere of Leslie Jordan's Fruit Fly. In 2014, AFO transitioned from producing an annual festival to producing a year-round season of local, national, and international solo theater. AFO's first full season featured four fully produced solo shows and SoloLab, a celebration of new work that featured reading and workshop performances from nine solo artists. Since 2015, under Executive & Producing Director Nicholas A. Cotz, AFO focuses on producing shows in New York City, with the goal of providing a sustaining income for its artists. Programs AFO is dedicated to fostering the next generation of solo artists through two play development programs: AFO Solo Collective (AFOSoCo), a new play development series that nurtures the development of mid-career solo artists and their audiences through cross-disciplinary exchange, peer-driven workshops, and panel discussions; and an 18-month Artist In Residence (AIR) program that develops a single new work, resulting in an off-Broadway production. The AIR program provides an artist with rehearsal space over 18 months, and stipends to be used for the services of a director, dramaturg, and/or designers to support the development of their work. All For One also occasionally offers classes on particular aspects of solo work.

At the age of twenty, he held his first exhibition at the salon of the \\"Associaci√≥ Art√≠stica de Barcelona\\".

It was called \\"Pel juny la fal√ß al puny\\" (In June with Sickle in Hand) and was bought the following year by King Alfonso XII.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado Peasant in Rome In 1875, he was awarded the first Fortuny Scholarship by the \\"Ayuntamento de Barcelona\\" (the city government), which enabled him to further his studies in Italy. He spent ten years there, visiting several major art centers and sending works home for display at the Sala Par√©s. During this visit, he was significantly influenced by the work of Domenico Morelli. Upon his return, his friend suggested that he come with him to Sitges to work with Santiago Rusi√±ol. This led to the establishment of the \\"Escola Luminista\\", an artistic movement that came to include many notable Catalan painters. He continued to exhibit widely, including at the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. In the 1890s, he made several trips to Madrid and Granada with Rusi√±ol to create illustrations for La Vanguardia. After 1895, he worked full-time as an illustrator for '.

Set in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, the story is about an expatriate American husband and wife who spend the day fishing, with a local guide.Oliver (1999), 254 Critical attention focuses chiefly on its autobiographical elements and on Hemingway's claim that it was his first attempt at using the \\"theory of omission\\" (iceberg theory).Steincke (1992), 61‚Äì62 Background and publication history In 1922, Hemingway moved to Paris as international correspondent for The Toronto Star.

If the middle, i.e., FORM, of the story is right then one ought to be able to reassemble it from memory ... If the thing wobbles and won't reform ... then it never wd. have been right.\\"Smith (1996), 41 Hemingway did not write again until visiting Cortina d'Ampezzo the following spring,Johnston (1984), 68 when, after a fishing trip he wrote \\"Out of Season\\", as he says \\"right off on the typewriter without punctuation\\".Nolan (1999), 45 He cut out the story's ending, which he meant to be tragic, on his theory of omission that \\"you could omit anything if you knew you omitted [it] and the omitted part would strengthen the story\\". Expecting the birth of their first child, the Hemingways returned to Toronto in October.Baker (1972), 15‚Äì18 During their absence from Paris, Robert McAlmon's Parisian Contact Press published Hemingway's first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems (1923), which contained \\"Out of Season\\". In 1925 the story was reprinted in the New York edition of In Our Time, published by Boni & Liveright.Tetlow (1992), 47 The 18 vignettes of in our time, that had been published by Bill Bird's Three Mountains Press in 1924, were re-ordered and placed between the short stories as interchapters. Summary The story is about a young American expatriate couple who are staying at a hotel in the village of Cortina d'Ampezzo, in northern Italy. The husband hires the drunk hotel gardener, Peduzzi, to be their guide for a fishing expedition. The couple leave the hotel with Peduzzi, who wants to be paid to buy more liquor. The wife is bad-tempered and not happy that Peduzzi is drunk. The husband buys a quarter of a liter of Marsala, and apologizes to his wife as they walk out of the town. Peduzzi speaks to them in both Italian and Tyrolean German, but they do not understand anything he says. The wife worries they will be caught, telling her husband, \\"We're probably being followed by the game police now. I wish we weren't in on this damn thing. This damned fool is so drunk too.\\"Hemingway (1925), 100 He suggests she go back to the hotel but she tells him that if they are caught she will go to jail with him. Peduzzi tells them the fishing area is a thirty-minute walk away, and at that point the wife allows her husband to convince her to return to the hotel. At the river, when Peduzzi helps the husband assemble his fishing equipment, he realizes they forgot to pack sinkers for the bait and so cannot fish. The two finish the bottle of Marsala and make plans to meet again early the next morning. On the way back to the hotel Peduzzi asks for more money, which the husband gives him, knowing he won't see the man again. Themes and style \\"Out of Season\\" contains themes found throughout In Our Time: men who are weak and powerless (particularly fathers and husbands); finding refuge in sports, the outdoors and alcohol; and the inability to articulate and communicate without confusion.Tetlow (1992), 81 Hemingway critic Wendolyn Tetlow writes that the overall confusion in the story underscores its title. The husband and wife are at odds after an apparent misunderstanding; the waitress is confused at the husband's order; Peduzzi has a secret but the townspeople seem to know what it is. The brown and muddy stream is a wasteland, the weather cold and damp, the husband unable to fish without proper tackle.Tetlow (1992), 82‚Äì83 Alienation in the modern world is particularly evident in \\"Out of Season\\", and is similar to T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land.Bickford (1992), 75‚Äì76 Hemingway's world, the early-20th century, is \\"out of season\\", a place of war, death, tangled relationships, without emotional fulfillment. Reception In Our Time received good reviews; Edmund Wilson described the writing as \\"of the first distinction\\";qtd. in Wagner-Martin (2002), 4 and biographer James Mellow writes the volume is a Hemingway's masterpiece.Mellow (1992), 266‚Äì267 Charles Nolan writes that \\"Out of Season\\"'s first sentence \\"is the kind we have come to expect from Hemingway who had a genius for effective openings.\\"Nolan (1999), 46 References Sources * Baker, Carlos (1972).

Between 1950 and 1954 he served as General Secretary of the country's Liberal Democratic Party. Life =Early years= T√§schner was born in Dresden, in the southern part of what was then central Germany, during the middle of the war. His father was an administrative worker. He attended school locally. His secondary school was a , intended to prepare pupils for careers in commerce and administration. On leaving school T√§schner took administrative internships in Dresden, Pirna and Heidenau. 1937 was the year of his 21st birthday, and he was called up for National Labour Service. The next year he was conscripted into the army. By the time the war ended, in May 1945, he was a junior Non- commissioned officer and a prisoner of war. In 1946 Herbert T√§schner returned home to what was now the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. The defeat of Naziism appeared to have marked the end of one-party government, and T√§schner joined the Liberal Democratic Party, becoming a leading party activist in the party's so-called \\"Friedrich Naumann\\" group - effectively the party local leadership team - in Dresden. Between 1946 and 1949 he served as the party's district secretary, becoming in 1949 the party General Secretary (still based in Dresden) for the whole of Saxony. =Politics= The German Democratic Republic was founded in the former Soviet occupation zone in October 1949, but by that time the basis for a return to one-party government had already been created, under Soviet administration in April 1946 with the contentious merger of the old Communist Party with the Moderate-left SPD. One party government under Hitler had involved banning parties other than the Nazi Party. Under Ulbricht the ruling party sought to achieve a monopoly of power not by banning other parties but by controlling them. The LDPD was one of several parties and quasi-political mass movements grouped together into an organisational structure controlled by the ruling SED (party), and known as the Democratic Bloc\\"Die vier von der sowjetischen Besatzungsmacht zugelassenen Parteien halten ihre erste gemeinsame Besprechung ab. Die Vertreter der vier Parteien beschlie√üen, ihre gegenseitige Unabh√§ngigkeit anzuerkennen und eine einheitliche Front der antifaschistischen demokratischen Parteien zu bilden, um mit vereinten Kr√§ften die vor uns stehenden gro√üen Aufgaben zu l√∂sen.\\" Franz Osterroth, Dieter Schuster, Chronik der deutschen Sozialdemokratie. Berlin [u.a.], Electronic ed., Bonn, FES Library, 2001, Stichtag: 14 July 1945 (rebranded in 1950 as the National Front). =Rising to the top of the Liberal Democratic Party= During the later half of the 1940s the SED had worked hard to ensure its own electoral success, but it had not succeeded in winning every election. For 1950 new arrangements were set in place involving a \\"single list\\" electoral system. Voters were presented with a single list of candidates and were able to vote for or against the list. Voting against the list required a voter to use a separate ballot box under the surveillance of the election officials. The new system electoral system was a success: between 1950 and 1986 the SED always received more than 99% of the votes cast in general election. The so-called bloc parties were not wholly disenfranchised, however since along with certain mass movements they received a fixed quota of seats in the national legislature '. Those objecting to the \\"single list\\" electoral system included politicians who had already vociferously objected to the \\"Bloc party\\" system, among them G√ºnter Stempel who was the General Secretary of the Liberal Democratic party (LDPD). On 8 August 1950 Stempel was arrested for rejecting the \\"single list\\" voting system and on 6 September he was stripped of the party leadership. Seventeen months later he would be condemned to twenty-five years forced labour by a Soviet military tribunal. Herbert T√§schner enjoyed relatively good relations with the SED (party) and with the recently created Ministry for State Security: this left him as the \\"strong man\\" of the LDPD. The Liberal Democrats held a party conference at the end of September 1952 at which they formally accepted the \\"Creation of Socialism\\" in the German Democratic Republic, and T√§schner was mandated with exceptional powers to transform the party towards \\"democratic centralism\\". This in effect was the point at which the Liberal Democratic Party accepted its diminished status as an element within the National Front, and it was also the point at which Herbert T√§schner became the party's General Secretary, On 20 November 1950 T√§schner wrote from Berlin to of the regional party in Saxony, resigning from his position as regional party General Secretary, explaining that the heavy burden of his national party responsibilities made it impossible to continue also with the job in Saxony. He warmly thanked his colleagues in Saxony regarding their work together and commended his successor as regional Democratic Secretary, a man called D√∂ring. Along with his post as party General Secreatary, between 1950 and 1954 T√§schner was a member of the National Legislative assembly ('). =Transforming the party= He remained party General Secretary for nearly four years, till May 1954. As party General Secretary, T√§schner led the transformation of the Liberal Democratic Party into a de facto Leninist cadre party. In the view of a younger party colleague , the position gave him almost unlimited control over the party apparatus, which he used ruthlessly, with powerful backing from the Soviet authorities, to purge the party of all its \\"reactionary elements\\". His most high-profile victim was his colleague, the leading Liberal Democrat Karl Hamann. The early 1950s were a period of heightened political nervousness in the German Democratic Republic with a series of high-profile show trials and, in 1953, the uncompromising suppression of an insurrection. Within the Liberal Democratic party T√§schner was the most prominent member of a four-man leadership collective, of which the other three were Johannes Dieckmann, and Hans Loch. The party leadership maintained good relations with East Germany's ruling SED (party), but by 1954 they had become increasingly estranged from the rest of the party membership. The SED would have preferred for Herbert T√§schner to have remained in his post as Liberal Democratic Party General Secretary, but he was nevertheless relieved of the position in May 1954. As one unsympathetic commentator pointed out at the time, the periodic sacrifice from among least loved of the party apparatchiks made the remaining comrades more docile.‚ÄûOpfere von Zeit zu Zeit den unbeliebtesten des Apparates, um so gef√ºgiger werden die Genossen wieder!‚Äú His successor as party General Secretary was Manfred Gerlach, still aged only 28, who took a less confrontational approach to the role, though there was little he could do to change the undemocratic character of the party. =After the nemesis= T√§schner was fortunate in that his fall from grace came only after the death of Stalin, following which politics in Central Europe became a little less brutal. Whereas his predecessor had been sent to a Siberian labour camp, T√§schner was found a job in publishing, initially, between 1954 and 1956, as director with the Th√ºringische Landeszeitung, at that time a state sanctioned newspaper of the Liberal Democratic Party, based in Weimar. From 1956 till 1962 he was a director of the GST (National Sports and Technology association) publishing section, and from 1962 till 1979 of a music publisher called . Towards the end of his life he was also entrusted with the leadership of an LDPD district team in Berlin-Friedrichshain. Herbert T√§schner died in Berlin a couple of months short of his 68th birthday.

He was also an aviation artist and illustrator, and is known for being one of the founders of the Clayton Knight Committee and the illustrator of the comic strip Ace Drummond. Early life and education Rochester, New York was Knight's birthplace. He went to school at the Art Institute of Chicago under famous artists, Robert Henri and George Bellows, from 1910 to 1913. In early 1917, Knight's career as an artist in New York City was flourishing. World War I In 1917, Knight volunteered for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. He was most interested in becoming an aviator. Along with 150 other American pilots, Knight was shipped off to England for training during 1917. In total, 2,500 pilots-in-training were transported to France and England. This was done to accelerate the pace of training. He started his training with the No.44 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps, which was formed in Essex on July 24, 1917. This particular squadron achieved its first triumph on January 28, 1918. Knight also flew with the 206 squadron of the Royal Flying Corps, and subsequently, the Royal Air Force. He served with the British Second Army in France. On October 5, 1918, Oberleutnant Harald Auffarth fired at Knight's plane causing it to crash. Knight was flying a British Havilland 9 at the time and, although hurt, he survived the crash landing on German territory. By the time the war ended, Knight was a prisoner of war at a German clinic. He was able to recuperate in a British ward. Career House & Garden in 1922 =Artwork and writing= After his recovery, Knight continued his career as an aviation artist. He exhibited his artwork at Associated American Artists. It is possible that his acquisition of airplane art, which he started acquiring in 1928, may be the most extensive collection of airplane art. Knight became known for his illustrations in aviation books. He also illustrated for The New Yorker. Knight and his wife were also illustrators of children's books, and often collaborated. He wrote and illustrated a few We Were There books, which were historical novels for children. This particular series was written as a fictional retelling of a historical event, featuring kids as the primary characters. He wrote and illustrated, We Were There...at the Normandy Invasion, We Were There...with the Lafayette Escadrille, and We Were There...at the Battle of Britain, the latter written with his wife. Both Knight and his wife were illustrators for the P. F. Volland Company, most known for publishing children's books. Knight's children's book, The Non-Stop Stowaway: The Story of a Long Distance Flight (1928) was published under the Buzza Company imprint. Knight was the author, co-author, and/or illustrator of many other books including: *War Birds: Diary of an Unknown Aviator (1926) *The Red Knight of Germany: The Story of Baron von Richthofen (1927) *Pilot's Luck (1929) *Ships Aloft: A Construction Book for Future Flyers (1936) *Quest of the Golden Condor (1945) *Secret of the Buried Tomb (1948) *Skyroad to Mystery (1949) *Hitch your Wagon-Bernt Balchen (1950) *The Story of Flight (1954) *Normandy Invasion (1956) *Lifeline in the Sky- MATS (1957) *Plane Crash (1958) *Battle of Britain (1959) *About our Armed Forces (1959) *The How and Why Book of Rockets and Missiles (1960) *Layfayette Escadrille (1961) *Rockets, Missiles and Satellites (1962) =Clayton Knight Committee= Knight formed The Clayton Knight Committee in 1940 with Billy Bishop. Knight was living in Greenwich Village at the time. Its mission was to bring Americans to Canada in order to prepare and fight for the Allies during the time of U.S. neutrality. The committee was funded by Homer Smith, and assisted by pro-war German √©migr√©s. Essentially it worked as a secret and illegal recruitment company. From 1939 to 1942, Knight's \\"job\\" was \\"Special Correspondent for the Associated Press.\\" This was a cover for his main job, working for The Clayton Knight Committee. Bishop spent most of 1940 in London with Winston Churchill, which meant Knight had to set up office and find new partners during this time. Their original headquarters was in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. It eventually expanded to Spokane, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Kansas City, Cleveland, Atlanta, Memphis, and San Antonio. =Later years= The Clayton Knight Committee was terminated in May 1942. Between 1943 and 1945, Knight was an official artist for the United States Army Air Forces in Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, and the Central Pacific. He worked also as an historian. His original artwork, personal diaries, and documents from the wars are held in the Air Force University Library and Historical Branch. Additionally, some of his papers are held by the University of Southern Mississippi's de Grummond Children's Literature Collection. On July 10, 1946, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his service to England in World War I and World War II. Personal life Knight's wife was Katherine Sturges Dodge, a fellow illustrator, artist, and designer. They had two sons, Clayton Joseph and Hilary Knight, who is the illustrator of the Eloise series of children's books. Clayton Knight died on July 17, 1969 in Danbury, Connecticut.

Along with his twin brother Bill and business partner Bev Morgan, Meistrell helped develop and market the first commercial neoprene wetsuit. This evolved into the Body Glove surf brand, which by 2013 was a $200 million annual enterprise and a leader in the field.  Early life  Sons of a banker who was murdered when they were four, identical twins Bob and Bill Meistrell were born in Boonville, Missouri, on July 31, 1928. The youngest of seven, Meistrell relocated to California with his family at the age of 16. Although Meistrell had not before that time even seen the ocean, he developed a fascination with it in early childhood. He and his brother taught themselves to dive in ponds in Missouri, using a bicycle pump, a garden hose and a diving helmet cobbled from household supplies. Dive N'Surf and Body Glove Meistrell graduated from El Segundo High School and then entered the United States Army during the Korean War. He was stationed at Fort Ord. In 1953, then Los Angeles County lifeguards, he and his brother invested in diver Bev Morgan's surf shop in Redondo Beach, Dive N' Surf. The brothers replaced Morgan's former partner, surfboard shaper Hap Jacobs, buying in with $1,800 borrowed from their mother. Morgan had discovered a rejected design for a two-piece military neoprene wetsuit and was selling this through his shop. The suit was not popular, however, and to begin with, the partners could only afford to work part-time in the store, having to maintain other jobs to support themselves and their fledgling business. Meistrell and his partners focused on making the wetsuit more comfortable by being the first to manufacture wetsuits usine neoprene. In the late 1950s, the partners formed a corporation. Morgan wanted to leave the company, and arranged with the brothers to pay off his interest at 30% of the business's assets, a debt they satisfied over a decade by paying Morgan's alimony payments to his ex-wife. In 1959, the film Gidget helped popularize the wetsuit, and as demand rose Meistrell expanded their product line, establishing the Body Glove brand with products for surfers, divers and other water sports athletes in the mid-1960s. In the 1990s, the company moved manufacturing to Thailand. Today, the Meistrell family still owns 25% of Body Glove. Diving and exploration In addition to his business enterprise, Meistrell was a diving instructor, including working with celebrities such as Lloyd Bridges, Gary Cooper, Charlton Heston and Richard Harris to prepare them for roles. Meistrell was also proponent and builder of one-man submarines which he used to search the seabed particular for wreckage. In his explorations, alone or with others, he found off the coast of Catalina a store of jade, off Palos Verdes a 280-lb stone that resembled anchor stones in use by the Chinese 2,000 years ago, and off Crescent City a cache of gold coins from a sunken paddle wheel steamer. In the early 1990s, Bob helped found the Catalina Conservancy Divers, a volunteer group involved in the protection and restoration of the waters around the island. Conservancy divers assist academics in studying the aquatic environment, planting sensors, counting species, and an unsuccessful attempt to reestablish the over collected abalone population. interview with Rod Stewart/Mike Davis, CCD board, 1993 Death Meistrell died on June 16, 2013, of a heart attack at the age of 84 while repairing his boat the Disappearance in Catalina, before setting off to be the lead boat for a paddleboard race. He was survived by his wife (Patty), three sons (Robbie, Ronnie, Randy), nine grandchildren (Tracey, Matt, Jamie, Nick, Kenna, Robert, Rhoni, Randi, and Makayla) and three great-grandchildren (Mia, Maddox, and Mila).

Life He was born in Mansfield, Ohio; his father was the Rev James Wilkinson and his mother Jane Wilkinson. His early career was as a sheetmetal worker. He was interested in natural history from a young age but had no formal training in the subject, gaining in competence as he devoted his leisure time to the study. Wilkinson fought in the American Civil War between 1861 and 1865 before returning to his original occupation. In 1873, an opportunity arose to visit Mexico, where he joined his brother who was a mining engineer in Batopilas, Chihuahua. He stayed there for two years, working with his brother but also spending much time collecting specimens of the indigenous flora and fauna. He sent about five hundred reptile specimens to the herpetologist Edward Drinker Cope. In 1875 Wilkinson returned to Mansfield because of his mother's state of health. Here he collected cultural, historic, military and scientific objects of interest from early settlements in Ohio. He made a shorter trip to Mexico in 1885, where he made extensive collections of items of interest to be found in the vicinity of Chihuahua. By 1891, with an additional contribution from Dr. J.R. Craig, he had amassed a sufficiently large collection to establish the Mansfield Memorial Museum of which he became curator. This was his full-time occupation for the next fourteen years, and he catalogued, arranged, identified and displayed the exhibits, building most of the display cases and cabinets himself. He retired from this post in 1905 and died in 1918. The museum is still in existence and houses collections of Native American relics, artifacts from Africa and Asia, military objects and natural history items. The Natural History Museum, London houses a collection of Spermatophytes made by Wilkinson.

He is facing several criminal charges. In 2020, he joined Rashtriya Janata Dal. Life and career He was born in a village Nadawan falling under Barh CD block, Bihar. He contested and won from the Mokama assembly seat in 2005 on a JDU ticket. He retained the seat in 2010, defeating Sonam Devi of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) by a large margin. He is married to Neelam Devi. On 2 September 2015, Singh quit the JDU following a fall-out with leader Nitish Kumar over the JDU's new alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal. On 16 August 2019, Singh was booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act after the police took possession of an AK-47 rifle, a magazine, live cartridges and two hand grenades following a raid on his ancestral home in Ladma village of Patna district. In 2020, Singh was given a ticket from Rashtriya Janata Dal to contest in the upcoming Bihar legislative election. Criminal cases and influence Singh has numerous cases of murder, kidnapping, and land grabbing lodged against him. The Barh region has remained notorious for dreaded caste wars particularly between two Forward Castes of Bihar, the Bhumihars and Rajputs. In these wars he emerged as a saviour of his community. According to locals, people in this region refrain from going outside during night due to fear of being kidnapped or murdered. The fortune of Singh turned when Nitish Kumar, decided to nominate him as his candidate on the ticket of Janata Dal (United) from the Mokama constituency. It was considered as paradoxical by a section of media that Kumar who vowed to end 'criminalisation of politics' was backing such a person against whom charges of serious cognizable offences were lodged. But, amidst criticism and counter statements Singh managed to win from Mokama seat due to support of his castemen as well as the wave of Nitish Kumar. Singh has been three times MLA from Mokama. Singh‚Äôs activities dragged the nation's attention when in 2007 he was reported to have two journalists from NDTV 24√ó7 and ANI news as hostages in his official bungalow. It was reported that they had been there to interview Singh upon his involvement in murder and molestation of a women called Reshma Khatoon whose body was recovered in a sack near the capital. The political protection given to Singh and another gangster named Sunil Pandey by the ruling regime was aimed at mobilisation of Bhumihar caste. According to the locals, Singh who was known as \\"Chhote sarkar\\" in Mokama is a role model of Bhumihars, who consistently opposed Laloo Yadav's regime. Thus, political parties opposing Yadav used him as a tool to mobilise Bhumihar voters.

Biography  Little is known about his early life. He apparently received his artistic training in Italy. In 1693, he became a Leutnant in the service of Duke Rudolf Augustus of Braunschweig-Wolfenb√ºttel, but appears to have served primarily as a court painter. His only known military activity came during a campaign against Hanover in 1702. In 1699, he married Agnesa Duve (1680‚àí1727), daughter of Achatius Duve (1644‚àí1698), pastor of the Aegidienkirche. In 1700, Rosine Elisabeth Menthe, the Duke's morganatic wife, became their first child's godmother. In 1715, the new Duke, Augustus William became godfather to their son. That same year, he received an official appointment as \\"F√ºrstlichen Kunst- und Portr√§tmaler\\". His surviving portraits almost all depict members of the ruling family in Braunschweig-Wolfenb√ºttel and their relatives. A portrait of the Tsarevich Alexei, who had married Princess Charlotte, is one of his few portrayals of people outside the direct family lineage. His best-known painting, however, is of the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who was attached to the court in Braunschweig. It is currently in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum.

Background Ertuƒürul was an 1863-built sailing frigate of the Ottoman Navy. She left ƒ∞stanbul on July 14, 1889 with around 600 sailors and officers on board for an official visit to Japan. She completed her visit on September 16, 1890 after a three-month stay, and set sail from Yokohama for return. Around midnight on September 16, the vessel hit reefs and fell apart in stormy weather. She sank off Kii ≈åshima while only six officers and sixty-three sailors survived, most of them with injuries. The survivors were transported home aboard two Japanese corvettes in October 1890, who were received by the sultan Abdul Hamid II in January 1891. Cemetery and monument In February 1891, 150 bodies recovered from the wreckage were buried in a newly established cemetery. On September 15, 1891, the first anniversary of the disaster, a monument was erected far from the site of the accident, near the Kashinozaki Lighthouse of Kushimoto. A second memorial stone was erected by the Japanese-Turkish Trade Association on April 5, 1929 and visited by Emperor Hirohito on June 3 the same year. After this information reached Turkey, its government proposed a new monument. The construction started on October 22, 1936, and the opening ceremony took place on June 3, 1937 with attendance by the Turkish ambassador. Museum Museum building at the Kushimoto Turkish Memorial and Museum. A museum was established near the memorial in cooperation with the Kushimoto Municipality and the Turkish Embassy in Japan. It was opened on December 14, 1974.

The film follows the activities of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in South Thanet, a constituency in South East England which had selected party leader Nigel Farage to contest the 2015 general election. Tracking the party's fortunes over a period of six months, the programme focused primarily on the activists who hoped to get Farage elected as an MP. While some attempted to explain UKIP's message, others were seen to express controversial opinions about race and immigration. Prior to its broadcast, some of the film's content led to one UKIP councillor being expelled from the party after she referred to black people as \\"negros\\". The film received generally positive reviews, with favourable comparisons drawn with a docudrama aired the previous week that had offered a fictitious account of Britain's first UKIP government. Meet the Ukippers attracted an audience of 1.42 million, giving BBC Two their best ratings for a factual programme broadcast in the 10.00pm Sunday evening slot since 2012. Synopsis The film follows the fortunes of Liz Langton, a hotel owner with a collection of porcelain clowns who was briefly UKIP's press officer in South Thanet, the constituency that selected Farage to fight the 2015 general election. It is 2014, and UKIP are enjoying a surge in popularity as Langton is seen attempting to deal with a series of public relations disasters that threaten to harm its public image. These include a remark made by MEP Janice Atkinson during a visit to the area when she described a Thai constituent as \\"a ting tong from somewhere\\", and revelations that Martyn Heale, the Chair of Thanet's branch of UKIP, had once belonged to the National Front. Langton brushes off both of these instances as minor follies, but is soon dealing with another PR catastrophe after a conversation with UKIP councillor Rozanne Duncan in which Duncan discusses her dislike of \\"Negros\\" and \\"people with Negroid features\\". She is advised to \\"tone it down a bit\\", but when details of her views are leaked to the media, Duncan is expelled from UKIP. Langton is seen to become increasingly disillusioned with the views of UKIP's members and eventually resigns from her post. Reception The film received generally positive reviews, although several critics expressed their concern about the nature of its content. Describing the documentary as \\"riveting\\", Iona McLaren of The Daily Telegraph observed that it had \\"turned up such outrageous, absurd racism that it could well have been actors playing out a very heavy satire. She also compared it favourably to UKIP: The First 100 Days, a Channel 4 docudrama attempting to portray a fictional account of life under a UKIP government that had aired a few days previously. \\"You would be forgiven [if you] had confused it with the fictional docudrama that so angered Farage last week\\". Viv Groskop of The Guardian described it as \\"astonishing, terrifyingly watchable\\". The Daily Mirrors Ian Hyland compared it favourably to the Channel 4 documentary, suggesting it was a \\"lesson in TV making\\", while suggesting the footage gave the impression that the party was \\"a cross between The League Of Gentlemen and Maggie the vomiting WI lady from Little Britain\\". Viewership Meet the Ukippers aired in the 10.00pm time slot, with overnight viewing figures suggesting it to have been the most watched BBC Two factual programme shown at that time on a Sunday evening since Louis Theroux: Twilight of the Pornstars aired in June 2012. Meet the Ukippers attained an audience of 1.42 million (an 8.5% audience share) compared with Theroux's documentary, which had achieved a viewership of 1.8 million (9.4%). Controversy Shortly before the documentary was aired, Rozanne Duncan said that she had no regrets about her comments, and attempted to defend them by claiming that her use of the word Negro was a descriptive term: \\"I still honestly believe that what I said was never at any time racist or derogatory,\\" that she \\"used the word \\"Negroes\\" as you would do Asians, Chinese, Muslims, Jews. It's a description, it's not an insult - in the same way as you would say, 'What do you mean by Jewish? Well, they belong to a community, they have got a certain faith, they have usually got noses that have got a bit of a curve to them, married women - if they are orthodox Jews - wear wigs,\\" and \\"there is absolutely no way I am a racist\\". Duncan further tried to deflect accusations of racism by saying that she felt \\"ok\\" when on a holiday in the Caribbean, where many African-Caribbean people live. Addressing the issue on the 22 February edition of BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House, Nigel Farage said that the party had been right to expel her: \\"Clearly she doesn't have any understanding of the deep offence she has caused by her comments, and we took the right decision.\\" Soul singer Beverley Knight was subjected to racial abuse by a user on social media site Twitter after she posted tweets expressing her disgust at the comments made by Duncan.

This tiny insect is endemic to Kenya where it is only known from the Taita Hills. In 2015, this newly discovered species was named in direct reference to the Boston Bruins (NHL) goaltender, Tuukka Rask. Etymology The specific name tuukkaraski is in direct reference to the Boston Bruins (NHL) goaltender, Tuukka Rask. The reasoning given by the authors was that \\"[t]his species is named after the acrobatic goaltender for the Finnish National ice hockey team and the Boston Bruins, whose glove hand is as tenacious as the raptorial fore tarsus of this dryinid species‚Äù. Distribution and ecology The species was described based on a single specimen collected with a Malaise trap at above sea level in Vuria Forest, Taita Hills, just inside an indigenous forest. Its ecology, including the host species, is otherwise unknown. Description The species description is based on a single female, the holotype, now stored in the collections of the National Museums of Kenya. The first pair of legs have enlarged claws referred to in the naming of this species. However, the claw is still tiny, less than long, as Thaumatodryinus tuukkaraski is a small species measuring only in length. The occipital carina is incomplete. The antennae are clavate. The wings are fully developed; the forewings have a transverse band whereas the hindwings are hyaline. The body is mostly black, with some testaceous or brown parts. The legs are testaceous-whitish except for the clubs of femora that are brown.

Between 1721 and 1727 he led the Tibetan cabinet (Kashag, ) that governed the country during the period of Qing rule of Tibet. He was eventually murdered by his peers in the cabinet, which triggered a bloody but brief civil war. The nobleman Polhan√© S√∂nam Topgy√© came out as the victor and became the new ruling prince of Tibet under the Chinese protectorate. Rise to power Khangchenn√© (the one from Khangchen), often known by the title Dai-ching Batur in Tibetan sources, did not stem from any of the older noble houses of Tibet. He was able to make a career thanks to the Khoshut protector-king Lhabzang Khan who appointed him governor of West Tibet (Ngari) in 1715. Simultaneously he was the chief minister of the ruler.Petech 1950, p. 28. It is possible that he reached this position since he was married to a daughter of Lhabzang Khan. The Dzungar people unexpectedly invaded Tibet from the north-west in 1717 as a part of their strategy to dominate Inner Asia and to keep the Qing dynasty out. Khangchenn√© was the first to warn Lhabzang Khan for the impending danger. However, he was not able to assist the king in the defensive struggle from his distant base in West Tibet. Lhabzang Khan was killed in action in Lhasa in November and the Dzungar took over Tibet and led a harsh regime. As a marionett ruler they appointed the nobleman Tagtsepa.Petech 1950, pp. 43-4. 1725 Tibetan Legal Document of Khnagchene bSod-nams rgyal-po After the Dzungar conquest, Khangchenn√© stayed in Ngari and began to interrupt the lines of communication between the Dzungars stationed in Tibet and their home base in Dzungaria. In 1719 he successfully attacked a troop of mounted Dzungar warriors who were about to bring some of Lhabzang Khan's old officers to Dzungaria. Together with the nobleman Pholhan√© he organized military resistance against the Dzungar. After almost three years, the unpopular Dzungar rule came to an end through a 1720 expedition launched by the Qing Kangxi Emperor. The puppet regent Tagtsepa was executed, the 7th Dalai Lama was brought to Lhasa, and a provisional government was formed by the occupants.Petech 1950, pp. 62-4. Thanks to his great services against the Dzungars, Khangchenn√© was appointed head of a Tibetan cabinet or Kashag in 1721 on the orders of Kangxi. He thereby kept his own basis of power in Ngari. The old office of desi (regent) was abolished as it gathered too much power in one hand. Instead Khangchenn√© received the titles Dai-ching Batur and chairman of the cabinet.Shakabpa 1967, p. 141. He was granted the Yardrokling estate for his personal support.Shakabpa 2010, p. 436. Leader of the cabinet The new Tibetan government had to cope with several difficulties from the beginning. Apart from an enormous inflation, there was a problem of providing for the 3,000 men in the Chinese garrison. As a consequence the Tibetan population was burdened with a substantial tax increase. This problem was solved in 1723 when the Qing troops withdrew, leaving the administration entirely in Tibetan hands without any military support. At the same time, however, a rebellion took place in Kokonor in present-day Qinghai. A Khoshut prince called Chingwang Lozang Tenzin rebelled against the imperial government. After the revolt had been suppressed, Kokonor (Qinghai) was integrated into the Qing Empire in early 1724 and thus separated from Central Tibet.Shakabpa 1967, p. 141; Shakabpa 2010, p. 438. It was also problematic for the running of government affairs that Khangchenn√© was often absent from Lhasa. He preferred to stay in Ngari. In 1723 he interfered successfully in a war in Nepal between the kingdoms of Mustang and Jumla. He dispatched 100 Mongolian horsemen to southern Mustang in order to besiege the fortress Kagbeni together with troops from Mustang and Ladakh.Petech 1977, pp. 89-90. In 1725 the Yongzheng Emperor ordered him to reside permanently in Lhasa. The jurisdiction over Ngari was entrusted Khangchenn√©'s elder brother Gashipa Tseten Tashi. Hostility between the ministers Khangchenn√© possessed great competence but was perceived as arrogant and ill-suited to cooperate with the others in the Kashag.Kapstein 2006, p. 150. His impopularity further increased due to an edict issued by Yongzheng which stipulated the persecution of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, which the Dalai Lama considered heretic. All the other members of the Kashag including Pholhan√© were against the implementation of the edict. Nevertheless Khangchenn√© tried to follow the emperor's will. As a consequence his standing among the Tibetan population shrank more and more.Shakabpa 1967, pp. 141-2. From the very beginning, the Kashag was split into two hostile camps. On one side stood Khangchenn√© and Pholhan√©, both representatives of a new layer of nobles and adherents of the Chinese emperor. Both had their main bases in West Tibet and Tsang (West Central Tibet). The other side, supported by the father of the Seventh Dalai Lama, consisted of Ngaph√∂pa Dorje Gyalpo, Lumpan√© Tashi Gyalpo and Jaran√© who represented the old Tibetan nobility and had vested interests in √ú.Shakabpa 1967, p. 141. From a regional point of view they represented the nobles of Central and South Tibet. The murder of Khangchenn√© and its consequences The open hostility between the two parties impeded a smooth government from the start. Finally the representatives of the old nobility decided to eliminate Khangchenn√© and Pholhan√©. The assault was obviously planned during a long time. Pholhan√© had left Lhasa since his wife was seriously ill and stayed at their residence in Pholha. There he received a letter from the teacher of the Seventh Dalai Lama that warned him of staying in Lhasa in July‚ÄìAugust 1727. He should also take care that his eldest son did not stay in Lhasa in this period.Petech 1950, p. 97. Pholhane immediately sent a word of warning to Khangchenn√© via friends, but he did not take much notice of it. The conspirators heard that the Yongzheng Emperor had sent two envoys to Khangcenn√© to offer praise and resolved to strike quickly before they had arrived.Shakabpa 2010, p. 440. On 5 August 1727 a routine meeting of the Kashag took place in an upper room of the Jokhang temple. Khangchenn√© took part of it in a good mood, joking and fraternizing. A letter was handed to him by a subordinate official. As Khangchenn√© began to read, he was unexpectedly seized from behind by some officials. All the present ministers now drew their daggers and stabbed Khangchenn√© to death.Petech 1950, p. 101. His guards, who waited outside the office, were killed as well, while all present followers of the murdered minister were apprehended and taken away. On the next day the murderers sent people to arrest and kill Khangchenn√©'s wife and her sister, together with his secretary and a steward. The conspirators dispatched a troop to Pholha with orders to eliminate Pholhan√©. The latter, however, had arranged for his escape to West Tibet, and the troop had to turn back without carrying out the deed.Shakabpa 1967, p. 142. The consequence was a civil war that raged for a year, where Pholhan√© eventually triumphed. The noble house Gashi, more known under the name Doring (), survived this assault on its main representative. His relatives served the various Tibetan governments until the 1950s.

Their influences include Gabor Szabo and Carlos Santana. The members are twins of Polish origin, singer Dorottya and harpist Fanni Nizalowski from Budapest, bassist D√°vid Godzs√°k, an ethnic Hungarian from Kir√°lyhelmec, Slovakia, and producer Levente Szab√≥ from S√°rospatak. Godzs√°k left to pursue a career with other musical groups and was replaced by √Åron Farkas. One of their main goals is to bring back the harp into modern popular culture. The band's first single was released in June 2015, On The Grind, and was played on the radio. History The Nizalowski sisters began playing the harp in 2004. In 2014, they graduated from the J√≥zsef Z√°borszky-founded Zugl√≥ Szent Istv√°n Music Secondary School. Their teachers include Katalin Nagy and Deborah Sipkay. Their favorite subjects were choir, folk music, music literature and music history, with their music theory proficiency having an effect on their songs. The twins performed at home and abroad with the choir of the school, the St. Stephen King Symphony Orchestra, the Zugl√≥ Philharmonic Orchestra and as a duo. They perform in schools, churches, elderly homes and corporate events. Their goal is to popularize the harp with the other instruments of popular culture. In this context, with their parents they created the first Harper's blog of 170 writers in Hungary, which contains biographies, interviews and musical history curiosities. They are inspired by the New York Harp Ensemble, founded by Aristid von W√ºrtzler (1925-1997). They are also active in the Polish community in Hungary. Farkas has been a bassist for ten years, and has been in numerous jazz, pop and rock formations during his career. In 2011, he graduated from the imPro Budapest Music School of Music. Szab√≥ studied and edited the school radio at √Årp√°d Vez√©r Gymnasium in S√°rospatak. Since 2001, he has played piano, has been writing songs since 2011. He is also a producer of imPro productions and as a music producer, he is also intensively interested in filmmaking. With thirteen years of folk dance, it is important for him to stay in rhythm, so he programs the drums carefully in his productive work. Godzs√°k and Szab√≥ previously co- operated the GOMA formation. Their first album was released on 18 September, 2014. It contains four images. One recording was made with American rapper None Like Joshua and Dorottya plays in this recording. =Mesmerize= The band is most notable for participating in A Dal 2015, the national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 with the song \\"Mesmerize\\".

Background After both Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez and Oscar De La Hoya defeated their opponents (Scott Walker and Darryl Tyson respectively) in tune-up bouts on February 9, 1996, the two fighters agreed to face one another in a \\"dream match\\" set for June of that year. The undefeated De La Hoya had already won world titles in two divisions and was looking to capture a third world title in a third weight class at only 23‚Äìyears old. The 33‚Äìyear old Chavez, meanwhile, was entering his 100th fight and still possessed one of the most impressive records in boxing history, having gone 97‚Äì1‚Äì1 and capturing four world titles in three divisions in his 16‚Äìyear career.De La Hoya and Chavez Pave the Way to a Payday, N.Y.

Times article, 1996-06-07, Retrieved on 2015-02-23 Despite his vast experience advantage over De La Hoya (who had only partaken in 21 pro fights up to that point) and his status as champion, the aging Chavez was initially installed as a 3‚Äì1 underdog before odds were dropped to 2‚Äì1 by the time of the fight. Though both fighters were of Mexican heritage, most Mexican and Mexican‚ÄìAmerican fans favored Chavez as De La Hoya had been born in the United States. In promotional stops for their fight, De La Hoya was largely booed by the largely Hispanic populations of Phoenix, San Diego and even his native Los Angeles.Chavez-De La Hoya Fight Is A Bout About Contrasts, Chicago Tribune article, 1996-06-07, Retrieved on 2015-02-23 A controversial decision was made prior to the fight as De La Hoya's promoter Bob Arum refused to let the fight be carried on Pay-per-view and instead opted for it to be shown almost exclusively on closed-circuit television, severely limiting the highly anticipated bouts audience. Arum claimed that he made the decision to combat the use of illegal \\"black boxes\\", which steal pay-per-view signals and allow its users to watch the program for free. Though Arum claimed that the fight would net somewhere between $60 to $90 million even without pay-per-view, the fight drew a somewhat disappointing crowd of 750,000, down from the 1.7 million fans Arum had expected, and fell well short of his expected earnings, with the fight grossing around $14 million.Pugilistic Throwback: A Closed- Circuit Fight, N.Y.

Only one minute into round one, De La Hoya connected with a straight right hand that opened up a huge gash around Chavez' eye. The fight was temporally halted not even a minute later as the cut had become severe enough for the referee Joe Cortez to stop the action and allow Chavez to find a towel. Though Chavez was able to continue, he was unable to get any momentum and was dominated by De La Hoya for the remainder of the fight. In round four, as Chavez was finally mounting some offense, De La Hoya took control of the latter stages of the round and brutalized Chavez with a series of hard combinations and broke Chavez' nose with a left hook.

As a juvenile he finished second in a well-contested minor event on his debut and was then narrowly beaten in the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud. In the following spring he won the Prix Greffulhe and then recorded his biggest success in the Prix du Jockey Club, beating Helissio into fifth place. He was well-beaten in his only subsequent race and was retired to stud. He had limited opportunities to prove himself as a sire of flat horses but had some success with his jumpers. Background Ragmar was a chestnut horse bred in France by Georges Sandor & Mme G Sandor. His sire Tropular, was from the first crop of foals sired by The Derby winner Troy. He won two minor races before being retired to stud where the best of his other winners was the Prix d'Aumale winner Guislaine. Ragmar's dam Reggae made no impact as a racehorse but was distantly related to the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Prince Royal. Ragmar was bought by Gerard Larrieu of Chantilly Bloodstock, acting on behalf of Jean-Louis Bouchard. During his racing career, the colt was trained by Pascal Bary. Racing career =1995: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut Ragmar contested the Prix de Courcevelles over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 8 August when he was ridden by Thierry Jarnet. He finished second, beaten one and a half lengths by Le Triton, a Criquette Head- trained colt who went on to win the Prix La Rochette and the Prix Jean Prat. Dominique Boeuf took over the ride when the colt was moved up in class and distance for the Group One Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud over 2000 metres on 29 October. He was the 8.8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind the Andr√© Fabre- trained Quorum, the Richmond Stakes winner Polaris Flight and the Prix de Cond√© winner Go Between. Restrained at the back of the five-runner field he made strong progress in the straight but failed by a short-head to catch Polaris Flight. =1996: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old Ragmar started the 2/1 second favourite for the Group Two Prix Greffulhe over 2100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 21 April. Khalid Abdullah's colt Radevore started favourite, whilst the other runners included Oliviero (third to Helissio in the Prix Noailles). Ridden by Mosse, he raced in third before taking the lead inside the last 200 metres and drew away to win by three lengths from Egeo, with Radevore two lengths back in third. Ragmar missed a clash with Helissio in the Prix Lupin. According to his owner, this was for two reasons: \\"One is rational, to avoid a hard race against Helissio. The other is more emotional, to be able to dream a little longer.\\" On 2 June Ragmar contested the 159th running of the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres on firm ground at Chantilly Racecourse. Radevore, Polaris Flight and Oliviero where again in opposition, but Helissio was made favourite at odds of 13/10. Other contenders included Grape Tree Road (Prix de Suresnes), High Baroque (Chester Vase), L'Africain Bleu (Prix de l'Avre), Arbatax (Prix Hocquart). Starting at odds of 9.3/1, Ragmar was held up by Mosse towards the rear of the field before making progress in the straight. He took the lead 200 metres from the finish and held on to win by a nose and a short neck from Polaris Flight and Le Destin with Helissio in fifth. Four weeks later the colt was matched against older horses for the first time in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and started 5.7/1 third favourite behind Swain and Helissio. Ragmar raced in fourth place but was unable to accelerate in the straight and finished seventh of the nine runners. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Ragmar became a breeding stallion, standing at the Haras de Saint- Gatien before being bought by the French National Stud. He was not popular with Flat racing breeders but was more successful as a sire of steeplechasers, covering many AQPS mares. Whilst based at Cluny in 1999 he was described as \\"a magnificent stallion, with a beautiful conformation and an even temperament\\".http://www.artemisian.com/troy/tropular/ragmarcluny.html He later moved to Britain where he was standing at the Vauterhill Stud in Devon as late as 2013. The most successful of his offspring has probably been Quartz de Thaix, who won nine National Hunt races between 2009 and 2012.

They played a mix of rock and roll, progressive rock and country rock with the emphasis on vocal harmony. The use of twin guitar solos was a distinctive feature of their music. The band holds the UK record for the group performing the greatest number of live gigs in a year. History The band was formed in South Wales in 1970 as a three-piece band with guitarist Ralph Evans, bassist Ricky John Holt and drummer Rob Reynolds. Shortly afterwards guitarist David (Dai) Shell, a Cardiff guitarist of some note, joined and became largely responsible for the tone of the band. The band signed to George Martin‚Äôs AIR Productions in 1972 with a line-up completed by Terry Bennett on vocals and Robert 'Congo' Jones on drums. The band utilised the twin lead guitar approach to great effect and released their debut album, Expecting Company, on Polydor in 1973. The band toured America's larger venues with such headlining groups as Ten Years After, Fleetwood Mac and Peter Frampton, but never found real commercial success. Sassafras achieved good press coverage, appearances on BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test and notable rock radio shows of the time, as well as festival appearances and major support slots, but never achieved the widespread appeal of fellow Welsh rock band Man. The band has been described as \\"a sort-of Welsh Fleetwood Mac/Eagles hybrid, with soaring west-coast melodies and a real roadtrip rock feel\\". In the early 1970s they held the record for highest number of gigs in a single year, with their 332 beating Slade by one. The band were still performing in 2006. Galloni, James and Ray Jones later joined Son of Man, led by George Jones, who play music by Man, as well as their own compositions.

He is the Co-principal Investigator for the Belfer Center's Project on Managing the Atom. Professional activities Before coming to Harvard, Bunn served as an adviser to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from 1994-1996. Bunn directed the secret 1995 study on nuclear security from the President‚Äôs Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). This study served as the basis for Presidential Decision Directive 41 (1995) which established U.S. government policies for securing nuclear materials. From 1992-1996, Bunn held a position as a study director at the National Academy of Sciences. During this time, he directed Management and Disposition of Excess Weapons Plutonium and this study became the foundation for U.S. government policy on plutonium disposition. (The creation of what is now the Office of Materials Disposition was announced the day after the report was released.) Bunn initially suggested and helped coordinate the Nuclear Threat Initiative‚Äôs $1.2 million gift to the International Atomic Energy Agency's nuclear security programs, which became the founding gift of the Nuclear Security Fund. He developed the concepts of ‚Äúcold standby‚Äù and ‚Äúwarm standby‚Äù for Iran‚Äôs centrifuges when various forms of ‚Äúsuspension‚Äù of Iran‚Äôs program were being discussed and co-authored compromise proposals for resolving the dispute over Iran‚Äôs program with former Iranian deputy foreign minister Abbas Maleki. Bunn and his colleague Anthony Wier were the first to suggest a four-year effort to secure nuclear material worldwide, a goal that was ultimately agreed to at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit. Bunn, Wier, and John Holdren, formerly President Obama‚Äôs science advisor, first proposed combining U.S. efforts to convert research reactors and remove HEU into a single program, which became the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Bunn was also an editor of Arms Control Today from 1990-1992. Education Bunn received his Ph.D. in Technology, Management, and Policy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2007.

Life  Athenion is only known through the report given by the Jewish historian Josephus on Herod the Great. But the account of Josephus is very hostile to Cleopatra and reflects in this connection the negative reporting of the memoirs of the Jewish king on the Ptolemaic queen, which found their way via Nicolaus of Damascus into the historic works of Josephus.Michael Grant, Kleopatra, p. 223. Therefore Josephus‚Äô unreliable reporting on Cleopatra has to be evaluated carefully. When in 32 BC the preparations for the final war between Mark Antony and Octavian were beginning Herod wanted to come to Antony‚Äôs rescue with an army, but was sent back by Antony to fight against Malichus, king of the Nabataeans, instead. According to Josephus Cleopatra is said to have been responsible for this decision of the triumvir,Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 15, 110; The Jewish War 1, 365. but the German classical scholar Christoph Sch√§fer does not believe that this is true.Christoph Sch√§fer, Kleopatra, p. 199-200. After Herod had won the first military encounter against the Nabataeans and threatened to also rout them in a second battle near Canatha, Athenion is supposed to have intervened in favour of the Nabataeans and helped them decisively to defeat the Jewish troops.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 15, 112-119; The Jewish War 1, 366-369. Christoph Sch√§fer considers Athenion‚Äôs allegedly attack on Herod is an invention of Josephus or his sources. He argues that if Athenion really helped the Nabataeans in the battle near Canatha it is not understandable why Cleopatra‚Äôs general did not interfere in Herodes‚Äô later very successful battles against the Nabataeans, which took place in summer 31 BC.Christoph Sch√§fer, Kleopatra, p. 200-201. Michael Grant is not so skeptically disposed to the report of Josephus.Michael Grant, Kleopatra, p. 271. Nothing is recorded about the further fate of Athenion.

Early life Leffall was born on May 22, 1930, in Tallahassee, Florida. His father had taught agriculture at Florida A&M; College and had been a high school principal in Quincy, Florida, where Leffall grew up. Leffall was 15 when he graduated from high school, and he finished an undergraduate degree at Florida A&M; in three years. He applied to Meharry Medical College and to the Howard University College of Medicine. When Leffall and a classmate had not heard back from either school, Florida A&M;'s president, William Gray, spoke to the president at Howard and secured admission for the two students. Leffall earned a medical degree in 1952, attending Howard at a time when Charles Drew was a faculty member there. In the 1950s, he spent several years in specialty training, having been mentored by Jack E. White, the first black physician to pursue training in surgical oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. After completing training at Memorial Sloan Kettering, Leffall spent a year in Germany with the Army. Career In 1962, Leffall joined the Howard faculty. By 1970, he was a full professor and chairman of Howard's surgery department. He earned his named professorship in 1992, the first such endowed chair in Howard's surgery department. Leffall performed surgery until the mid-2000s. Though he stopped actively practicing medicine in 2013, he maintained his teaching and administrative involvement at the medical school. In May 2015, Howard held a special grand rounds session to honor Leffall's service to the school.

Biography Major Wilfred Thesiger, (1944), (Imperial War Museum) Miss M S Cochrane, RRC, SRN, Matron, Charing Cross Hospital (Art.IWM ART LD1472) Devas was born in Bromley in Kent, the second of four children to Thomas Gronow Devas, the chairman of the Devas Routledge textile firm, and Marjorie Cecilia Watson. Devas attended Repton School and entered the Slade School of Fine Art in 1927, aged 16. At the Slade he studied alongside Rodrigo Moynihan, William Coldstream and Robin Darwin. In 1931 Devas married his fellow Slade student Nicolette Macnamara, whose sister Caitlin would later marry Dylan Thomas. Through the Macnamara sisters Devas met, and was influenced in his portrait painting by, Augustus John. During the Second World War, Devas served as an air raid warden in London as his persistent ill-health had excluded him from military service. Devas held his first major solo exhibition at the Agnew's Gallery in 1941 and he continued with his portrait painting, most notably with portraits of both Nicolette and Caitlin and also his friend Laurie Lee. The War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, commissioned several portraits from Devas of individuals who had distinguished themselves in the conflict, including Wilfred Thesiger and Captain George Hunt. At other points in the war WAAC purchased a number of portraits from Devas, including one of the Matron of Charing Cross Hospital. After the war Devas's reputation as a society portrait painter continued to grow. In 1943 he became a member of the New English Art Club and in 1945 he was elected to the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. Devas was elected an Associate member of the Royal Academy in 1953. He lived and worked at the Rossetti Studios in Chelsea and at one time shared studio space with the artist Norman Hepple. During the 1950s Devas produced at least nine portraits of young women for the Aero Girls advertising campaign run by J Walter Thompson for Rowntree's chocolate. Other commissions included a portrait of Sir George Dyson for the Royal College of Music in 1952 and a portrait of Elizabeth II in 1957. Devas's final public commission was of Peggy Ashcroft for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and was first shown, posthumously, at the Royal Academy in 1959. After a prolonged period of heart troubles Devas died of a stroke at his home in December 1958. He is buried at Putney Vale Cemetery in London. His epitaph reads \\"He was a rare man\\". A memorial exhibition was held at the Agnew's Gallery in 1959. Several years later, his widow Nicolette married the artist Rupert Shephard.

The decoration was instituted by Queen Elizabeth II on 15 December 1952.South African Medal Website - Union of South Africa (Accessed 1 May 2015) Institution The Union of South Africa Queen's Medal for Bravery, Silver, the lesser of two classes of South Africa's highest civilian decoration for bravery, was instituted by Royal Warrant of 15 December 1952, published in Government Gazette no. 5013 dated 27 February 1953. The medal replaced the Union of South Africa King's Medal for Bravery, Silver, after the accession to the British Throne of Queen Elizabeth II on 6 February 1952. Award criteria The earlier King's Medal for Bravery, Silver was awarded to recognise acts of gallantry performed in the face of imminent and obvious peril by those residents of the Union of South Africa or its dependent territories who endangered their lives in the act of saving, or endeavouring to save, the lives of others. Upon the institution of the Queen's Medal for Bravery, Silver, the conditions of eligibility that had applied to the King's Medal were expanded to include non-citizens of the Union for acts of gallantry within the Union or while saving or endeavouring to save the lives of citizens of the Union elsewhere. Order of wear In the British order of precedence, the Union of South Africa Queen's Medal for Bravery, Silver ranks as a third level decoration, equivalent to the Queen's Gallantry Medal. It is preceded in order of wear by the Indian Distinguished Service Medal and succeeded by the Distinguished Service Medal. In South Africa, the medal is ranked as a second level decoration and, despite its status, it has no post-nominal letters.

Early life and education Angella Dorothea Ferguson was born in Washington, D.C. to George Alonzo Ferguson and his wife Mary Burton Ferguson. She is African-American and was one of eight children. Though her father was a high school teacher, had his own architectural firm, and was a U.S. Army reservist, the family struggled financially, especially during the Great Depression. Angella became interested in chemistry and mathematics while attending Cardoza High School, which she graduated in 1941. She went on to earn a BS in chemistry from Howard University in 1945, and an MD from Howard University College of Medicine in 1949. At the time there were very few African-American women who were accepted into medical schools. She conducted her internship and residency at Washington Freedman's Hospital and joined the faculty at Howard University in 1953 as an instructor in pediatrics, a position she held until 1959, when she became assistant professor of pediatrics at Freedman's Hospital. She became a full professor at the latter hospital from 1963 to 1990. From 1953 to 1970 she was also an associate pediatrician at Freedman's Hospital. Concurrently, Ferguson was on the staff of the District of Columbia General Hospital; her tenure there extended from 1963 to 1990. Additionally, she had her own private pediatrics practice in Washington, D.C. Research Her early research required her to understand normal development in African American children, but to her surprise no such baseline data existed. In setting out to rectify this gap in knowledge, she made the startling discovery that African American infants learned to sit and stand earlier than infants of European descent. She attributed this trend to the fact that the parents of African American infants often did not have playpens or high chairs for them; hence they learned to sit and stand earlier than their white counterparts. Ferguson noticed the prevalence of sickle cell disease among the infants she treated in her practice. In her work she tracked the development of the disease in African American infants. At that time, sickle-cell anemia was a little-known disease. Through experimentation, she determined that if infants drank a glass of soda water once a day before age five, their chances of having a sickle-cell crisis - a condition in which the flow of damaged red blood cells is impeded, causing painful clogging of blood vessels - was reduced. She also developed a blood test to detect the disease at birth, which became a standard test in forty U.S. states by 2010. Administrative career In 1965 Ferguson was given the responsibility of overseeing the design and construction of Freedman's new pediatrics wing, and eventually the renovation of the entire hospital, completed in 1975. In 1970 she returned to Howard University as head of the University Office of Health Affairs. In 1979 she was promoted to associate vice president for health affairs, a post she held until her retirement in 1990. Memberships and recognition Ferguson is a member of the National Medical Association, the Society for Pediatric Research, the Society of Nuclear Medicine, and the New York Academy of Sciences. She is the recipient of two Certificates of Merit from the American Medical Association. Personal Ferguson married Charles M. Cabaniss, with whom she has two daughters.  See also  *Doris L.

It is a motile, helically coiled, obligate anaerobe that grows best at 37 ¬∞C, and is a novel member of its genus because of its ability to ferment molecules that other Treponema species cannot. T. socranskii‚Äôs growth is positively correlated with gingival inflammation, which indicates that it is a leading cause of gingivitis and periodontitis.  Discovery and isolation  Robert Smibert, John Johnson, and Richard Ranney isolated Treponema socranskii in Virginia, 1984. Volunteers with periodontitis and clinically-induced periodontitis supplied samples from beneath and above their gumlines for comparison to samples supplied from volunteers with healthy gums. The culture of T. socranskii were isolated from the samples supplied from the group of volunteers with periodontitis and clinically-induced periodontitis. Periodontitis is the lasting harmful inflammation of the gum line, and clinically-induced periodontitis is the condition in which healthy volunteers stop dental hygiene to induce periodontitis for controlled scientific study. Researchers used a media that contained meat and salt water that was filled with carbon dioxide to purge the sample of oxygen. These samples were cultured in duplicates on selective solid media plates after undergoing serial dilutions to ensure purity. These plates were placed into GasPak jars to remove any oxygen that may be present in the jar. The researchers inoculated colonies from the plates into OTI (oral treponeme isolation) broth and placed them into another GasPak jar. The jars were kept at 37 ¬∞C, and every week the samples were checked using dark-field microscopy.  Taxonomy  The taxonomic lineage of Treponema socranskii is Bacteria, Spirochaetes, Spirochaetia, Spirochaetales, Spirochaetaceae, Treponema, socranskii. The subspecies were named socranskii, buccale, and paredis. Treponema socranskii is unique to its genus due to the combination of a higher average GC content and its lack of need for serum in its growth media. Three other species in the genus do not use serum, and have GC contents around 36-39 mol% whereas socranskii has a GC content of 50-52 mol%. When compared to other cultured Treponema species: denticola, pectinovorum, and vincentii, a major factor unique to socranskii is the ability to ferment different molecules. The RapID-ANA system, which is a series of qualitative tests used to identify different anaerobic bacteria, is widely used to distinguish between different oral spirochetes. This method distinguishes socranskii from other species because its only positive test is the alkaline phosphatase test, while the other species are negative for this test.  Characterization  = Optima = The characterization of this organism was done when it was first cultured in 1984. T. socranskii is an obligate anaerobe that grows in media that contains fermentable carbohydrates. The media must also contain liquid from an unspecified rumen or short chain fatty acids. The preferred temperature for T. socranskii is 37 ¬∞C, but it will still slightly grow between 25 ¬∞C and 42 ¬∞C. = Morphology = T. socranskii is helically coiled and motile using periplasmic flagella. In liquid media, it can move linearly or in a twisting screw-like motion. The cell size ranges from 6-15Œºm long and 0.16-0.18Œºm wide. The cells are wider in the center than at the ends and are curved slightly. When plated, colonies of T. socranskii form between 7‚Äì10 days after inoculation and appear white, translucent, irregular, with a dense center. = Ecology = T. socranskii is found in the space between the teeth and gums of patients with the varying forms of periodontitis. Of the samples taken from across sampling sites of the gum line, T. socranskii is found to be one of the most abundant of its genus. Studies on the human oral microbiome show that Gram-negative organisms including genera Treponema, Prevotella, Selenomonas, Tannerella, Haemophilus, and Catonella are not only present in samples from those with periodontitis, but they are actually selected for and have a much higher abundance than healthy samples. After treatment of periodontitis, there is a shift in the microbial community away from the Gram-negative organisms listed above, and selection for Gram-positive organisms. Healthy gumlines tend to be characterized by a low diversity of microorganisms within a single patient, but the taxa vary greatly across different individuals. Individuals with periodontitis have a high diversity of microbes, but the community structure is similar in all affected patients. These trends are due to the anaerobic and oligotrophic conditions in the diseased gums causing the anaerobic bacteria to be able to out compete the aerobic copiotrophs that usually make up the healthy communities. = Metabolism = Treponema socranskii differs from others in the genus due, in part, to its metabolism. T. socranskii is able to ferment compounds that others are not able to do so. The compounds that it can metabolize are arabinose, dextrin, fructose, galactose, glucose, glycogen, maltose, mannose, pectin, raffinose, rhamnose, ribose, starch, sucrose, trehalose, and xylose. The fermentation products are acetic, lactic, and succinic acid, with formic acid as a minor product. = Genomics = The genome of T. socranskii was sequenced by the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) using Illumina sequencing. The genome contains 2,804,628 base pairs of which 2,547,778 are coding pairs. The GC content is between 50-52 mol%. The DNA also contains 2563 genes of which 2509 code for proteins.  Implications  T. socranskii and 11 other organisms show an increased growth rate that correlates with an increased GI (gingival index) score. The GI score measures the intensity of the inflammation of the gingival crevice. This correlation between growth and high GI scores, combined with the frequency of T. socranskii in the gingival crevice of people with clinically-induced periodontitis and moderate/severe periodontitis has implications that point toward T. socranskii being a causative agent in periodontitis and gingivitis. Periodontitis is the condition that arises after leaving gingivitis untreated. In adults, periodontitis can be a major force in the acceleration of tooth loss because it damages the base of the teeth and harms their connection to the skull. This condition is easily prevented by daily dental hygiene such as brushing and flossing.

He is the nephew of the American jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius. Pastorius has played in numerous bands in the Florida region, has toured across the United States with various artists such as Tech N9ne and Pat Travers, appeared in a number of bass guitar related magazines and has released and appeared on several studio albums. He spent the summer of 2019 playing with Carl Palmer's ELP Legacy on the Royal Affair Tour along with Yes, Asia and John Lodge of the Moody Blues. History Pastorius started playing bass guitar at the age of 15 after being inspired by his high school friend, who had played the Red Hot Chili Peppers cover version of Stevie Wonder song Higher Ground for him. At the age of 17, Pastorius joined his first band FHM (The Fleshy Headed Mutants) and began to play with local musicians performing heavy metal originals and cover songs. He had performed on the album Jaco Pastorius Big Band Word of Mouth Revisited, a tribute to Jaco Pastorius, released on August 23, 2003 by Ohio record label Heads Up International. The album featured performances by Pastorius along with popular bassists Victor Bailey, Richard Bona, Jeff Carswell, Jimmy Haslip, Christian McBride, Marcus Miller, Gerald Veasley and Victor Wooten. He formed the band, David Pastorius and Local 518, and released their debut self-titled album in the spring of 2007 on Japanese record label P-Vine Records. In 2009, the band released their follow up album entitled Sense of Urgency. In 2009, Pastorius joined the Southern punk/funk band Elephant Gun with Trevor Prince on guitar and vocals, and Tom Van Dyke on drums. The members had stemmed from local Florida bands Local 518, Goliath and Big Orange Nitty Gritty. Elephant Gun hosted Wednesday night open mic events at Hustler Bar and Pool Room in the town of Indialantic, Florida. On December 17, 2011 while playing a set at Off The Traxx Sports Bar in Melbourne, Florida with Elephant Gun, David had a heart attack. He had gone to the hospital after the show and had two stents placed in his arteries. On January 21, 2012, Baroos Beachside Bar in the town of Indialantic, Florida, held a benefit concert to assist Pastorius and his family with his health issues. Six bands had played the event On July 31, 2011, Pastorius performed live alongside drummer Keith LeBlanc and guitarist Eric Gales for the concert event Eric Gales + Voodoo Chile - A Tribute To Jimi Hendrix at the B.B. King Blues Club & Grill in New York City. In 2013 and throughout 2014, Pastorius had started to record and film a series of video \\"bass remixes\\" of songs by one of his musical idols, American rapper, Tech N9ne, and posted them on YouTube. Pastorius's renditions caught the attention of Tech N9ne and his record label Strange Music, in turn they requested him to perform a version of the Tech N9ne classic song \\"This Ring\\". Shortly afterward in the autumn of 2014, Pastorius joined Tech N9ne's \\"Band Of Psychos\\" for a brief tour including 13 shows on the west coast of the U.S. In 2014, he was asked to contribute to the documentary film, JACO: A Documentary Film, produced and co-written by Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo. Pastorius along with music artists Rodrigo y Gabriela, Chino Moreno, and Tech N9ne are featured in a song during the credits at the films end. To assist in raising funds to complete the film, a campaign was started on crowd funding website Pledge Music; Pastorius offered 60 minute one on one video Skype lessons to help raise funds for the project. On October 6, 2014, he made an appearance at the Sweetwater Music Hall, in Mill Valley, California for a work-in-progress screening of the film and a special live performance with a variety of music artists. Influences Pastorius is a fan of many genres but listens to a lot of hip hop, 1980s, and heavy metal. His influences include bass players Sam Griffith, Robert Trujillo (of Metallica), Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers), Steve Harris (of Iron Maiden), Les Claypool (of Primus), and Mark King (of Level 42). His musical hero is Mike Patton of Mr. Bungle and Faith No More. Instruments Pastorius plays Marleaux bass guitars, a Classic Series Max- tone bass made by Artisan Bass Works and Hartke amps.

Schematic illustration of genotype-first approach The genotype-first approach is a type of strategy used in genetic epidemiological studies to associate specific genotypes to apparent clinical phenotypes of a complex disease or trait. As opposed to ‚Äúphenotype-first‚Äù, the traditional strategy that has been guiding genome-wide association studies (GWAS) so far, this approach characterizes individuals first by a statistically common genotype based on molecular tests prior to clinical phenotypic classification. This method of grouping leads to patient evaluations based on a shared genetic etiology for the observed phenotypes, regardless of their suspected diagnosis. Thus, this approach can prevent initial phenotypic bias and allow for identification of genes that pose a significant contribution to the disease etiology.Stessman, H. A., Bernier, R. & Eichler, E. E. A genotype-first approach to defining the subtypes of a complex disease. Cell 156, 872‚Äì877 (2014).Mefford, H. C. Genotype to phenotype-discovery and characterization of novel genomic disorders in a ‚Äúgenotype-first‚Äù era. Genet. Med. 11, 836‚Äì842 (2009). This approach is unaffected by phenotypic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance and levels of expressivity. Therefore, it is useful in complex diseases that also overlap, such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, enabling the diseases to be distinguished, and specific subtypes of the disease based on the genomic content to be determined. Currently, the genotype-first approach is used primarily for research objectives. However, the implications from these studies can have valuable clinical applications, including improved diagnosis, counselling, and support groups for individuals with the same genetic etiology.  Background  Initially the idea of identifying the genotype of individuals and subsequently their associated phenotype(s) was first used in early cytogenetic studies. Around 1960 the discovery of Trisomy 21 led to the realization that genetics could be used to predict phenotype(s). From the 1960s to 1990s cytogenetic techniques such as chromosome banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to identify and phenotypically characterize patients with chromosomal abnormalities.Ledbetter, D. H. Cytogenetic Technology ‚Äî Genotype and Phenotype. N. Engl. J. Med. 359, 1728‚Äì1730 (2008). Complex diseases and traits pose many difficulties for epidemiological studies due to their nature as multifactorial diseases. More than one gene can underlie a complex disease and generally contributes a smaller effect than what is observed in monogenic diseases (Mendelian diseases). In addition, many of these complex diseases exhibit diverse phenotypes as well as a wide range of expressivity and penetrance. Genes can also be pleiotropic, accounting for many seemingly distinct clinical phenotypes. These features limit the ability of both research and clinical studies to designate causal genes or variants to the observed phenotypes and to classify disorders. Clinicians are starting to recognize the need to classify genomic diseases by a common genotype rather than a common phenotype and how genotype-first approach can benefit this purpose.  Methods  Several methods can be used with a genotype-first approach, however, the following steps are usually included: # Establishment of a study population and genotyping # Analysis of genomic variants of interest found in the study population # Study populations are assembled based on genotype # Association of genotype to phenotype(s) within respective group The genotyping is generated using next-generation sequencing technologies (including whole-genome sequencing and exome sequencing) and microarray analyses. The raw data is then statistically analyzed for population-based frequency of the variants. Common variants are filtered out, and pathogenicity is determined though predicted genetic implications. These steps allow for the identification of presumed highly penetrant variants and their specific locus. The selected variants are usually resequenced for validation (by targeted Sanger sequencing). Validated genomic variants can then be analyzed for recurrences among affected individuals within the cohort. Pathogenicity of a genomic variant is statistically based on its significantly abundant presence in the affected compared to the unaffected individuals, not exclusively on the deleteriousness of the variant. A candidate variant can then be associated with a shared phenotype with the aspiration that as more patients baring the same variant with the same phenotype will be identified, a stronger association can be made. Finally, delineation is made between a specific variant to associated clinical phenotypes [Figure 1].  Clinical Implications and Examples  The genotype-first approach has been used to diagnose patients with rare diseases,Shi, L., Li, B., Huang, Y., Liu, T. & Lyon, G. J. ‚Äú Genotype-first ‚Äù approaches on a curious case of idiopathic progressive cognitive decline. 1‚Äì10 (2014). identify novel disease genotype-phenotypes associations,Lim, E. T. et al. Distribution and Medical Impact of Loss-of- Function Variants in the Finnish Founder Population. PLoS Genet. 10, (2014). and characterize uncommon or heterogeneous diseases based on patient's genotype.Traylor, R. N. et al. A genotype-first approach for the molecular and clinical characterization of uncommon de novo microdeletion of 20q13.33. PLoS One 5, 4‚Äì10 (2010). In 2014 the genotype-first approach was used to assess rare and low-frequency variants in the Finnish population. As the Finnish population is isolated and has recently undergone a population bottleneck, relative to other countries, it offers two main benefits for genotype-first studies. Deleterious variants are found at higher frequencies within a smaller spectrum of rare variants in bottlenecked founder populations. By comparing the variants found using whole-exome sequencing (WES) in the Finnish population to WES from a control group of non-Finnish Europeans, loss-of- function (LOF) variants were seen at a higher frequency in the Finnish population. The phenotypes of Finnish individuals with these LOF variants were then analyzed to ascertain novel genotype-phenotype associations. These associations detected included one that could be embryonic lethal, information that might not have been discovered in research using a phenotype-first approach. In addition, researchers also discovered novel splice variants in the LPA gene that reduce apolipoprotein A levels and offer a protective phenotype against cardiovascular disease. Genotype-first assessment is becoming the standard approach for clinical diagnosis of complex heterogeneous diseases. Microduplication and microdeletion syndromes have a range of characteristics, including intellectual disability and developmental delay, which vary in severity making patients with these syndromes very difficult to diagnose. Since the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, clinicians have been able to use a genotype-first approach to group these patients based on their microdeletion or duplication and document the disease features present in these groups.Watson, C. T., Marques-Bonet, T., Sharp, A. J. & Mefford, H. C. The Genetics of Microdeletion and Microduplication Syndromes: An Update. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 15, 215‚Äì244 (2014). Chromosomal microarray analysis, in particular, is being used clinically to assist in diagnosing patients with microdeletion and microdulplication syndromes.Reiff M, Mueller R, Mulchandani S, Spinner NB, Pyeritz RE, Bernhardt B a. A qualitative study of healthcare providers‚Äô perspectives on the implications of genome-wide testing in pediatric clinical practice. J Genet Couns. 2014;23:474‚Äì88. In diseases, such as Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where differentiating patients into disease subtype groups based on phenotype is challenging, genotype-first studies allow the classification of patients into subtypes based on their genetics. This in turn will give a greater understanding of the genetic causes of ASD, and could in the future define specific subtypes of ASD for patients to be diagnosed with. Genotype-first research, through the identification of novel disease-associated genes, can also benefit pharmaceutical companies and drug development. For complex diseases, using phenotype first gene-association, developing therapeutics is often unsuccessful due to multiple genes contributing to one disease. With genotype-first associations, the potential therapeutic target is identified first. Advantages and Limitations = Advantages = *A shift towards characterizing individuals by a common genotype rather than the clinical presentation will allow for classifying new syndromes and the genetic classification of a certain disease subtypes, as sequencing becoming cheaper, faster and more efficient.Volume 40 of International review of research in developmental disabilities, Deborah J Fidler, Academic Press, 2011) *Inheritance of a genomic variant from a healthy parent would not result in its exclusion from variant analysis, thereby accounting for the role of modifiers on phenotypic outcome. *This approach is unaffected by phenotypic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance and expressivity. *This approach contributes to studying both expressivity, pleiotropy and sporadic mutations. *This approach examines highly penetrant mutations that are associated with the disease regardless of the genetic background. *Comprehensive and detailed phenotyping is possible even with a small number of patients with common genetic etiology. *This approach can identify atypical presentations of disease when being used diagnostically. = Limitations = *The phenotype might change over time (e.g. becomes more severe, change in physical location) making genotype-first studies an assumption about the role of the variant in disease manifestation at a specific time point. Therefore, longitudinal follow up is important in order for the genotype-phenotype association to be valued with time and examine the disease‚Äôs prognosis. *Variants identified that might contribute to a mild phenotype, or to range of phenotypes, would not be beneficial in determining diagnosis and prognostic. However, in the future, as more disease subtypes are classified, mild phenotypes could have more relevance. *Genotype-phenotype association relies on the presentation of clinically recognizable phenotypes. *As seen in other genome association studies, this approach can generate variants of unknown significance, especially when being used diagnostically.

She is one of Mexico's leading feminists and has written many books aimed at reducing discrimination by opening public discourse on feminism, gender, prostitution and abortion. Since 1990, Lamas has edited one of Latin America's most important feminist journals, Debate Feminista (Feminist Debate). In 2005, she was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. Early life Marta Lamas was born in 1947 in Mexico City to Argentine parents. She studied ethnology at the Escuela Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (National School of Anthropology and History) and then completed a master's degree in anthropology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Journalistic endeavors In 1976, she founded a feminist magazine, Fem, and in 1987, she co-founded the first feminist newspaper supplement in Mexico for the newspaper La Jornada: Doble Jornada (Double Day). In 1990, she founded Debate Feminista (Feminist Debate) a publication aimed at connecting academic feminist theory with the practices of activists in the women‚Äôs movement. The publication is a springboard for discussing ideas within the movement to evaluate how they can be brought to the public. Debate has become one of the most important journals in Latin America, because it also prints men's articles. She was a founding member of La Jornada and is a contributing columnist to the magazine Proceso and the Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s and serves as an editorialist for the newspapers El Processo and Diario Monitor. Lamas has written numerous books and is a prolific feminist writer. Activism In 1990, she founded the Sociedad Mexicana Pro Derechos de la Mujer (Semillas), (The Mexican Society in Favor of the Rights of Women), which is an organization in which more privileged women can invest in women who have less opportunities. The group sponsors cooperatives and micro-enterprises and offers support centers and work groups which address problems women face, including human rights issues. The organization has expanded to have chapters in 24 of the 31 Mexican states. In 1992 Lamas co-founded the Grupo de Informaci√≥n en Reproducci√≥n Elegida (GIRE) (Information Group on Reproductive Choice) to \\"disseminate information on abortion and reproductive and sexual health and rights from the bioethical, social and legal perspectives to lawmakers and the press\\". One of the objectives of the group was to change the discussion from whether one was for or against abortion and instead focus on who should decide. Lamas indicated this was a pivotal change in progress in the abortion debate in Mexico. After 38 years of work by the feminist movement, driven by Ms. Lamas, in 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation decriminalized in Mexico City abortions which occur by 12 weeks of gestation. GIRE lawyers assisted in drafting legislation and in coordinating defense of the law when lawsuits alleged it was unconstitutional. Marta Lamas testified during the Supreme Court trial. Educator Lamas is a political science professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and lecturer at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Aut√≥nomo de M√©xico (Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico) (ITAM) In 2000 she founded the Instituto de Liderazgo Simone de Beauvoir (Simone de Beauvoir Leadership Institute), as a feminist organization of civil society with the goal of training social leaders.

It was constructed by Assam Bengal Railway. With the partition of India in 1947, portions of the Bengal Assam Railway which lay in Assam and the Indian part of North Bengal became Assam Railway. North Eastern Railway was formed in 1952 by amalgamating Assam Railway with Oudh Tirhut Railway and the Fatehgarh district of Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. Northeast Fronter Railway was formed out of North Eastern Railway in 1958. The portion of the system which fell within the boundary of East Pakistan was named as Eastern Bengal Railway. On 1 February 1961, Eastern Bengal Railway was renamed as Pakistan Railway and in 1962 it became Pakistan Eastern Railway. With the emergence of Bangladesh, it became Bangladesh Railway. After the independence of Pakistan on 15 August 1947 the broad-gauge portion of the Bengal-Assam Railway, lying in India was added to the East Indian Railway and the metre-gauge portion became the Assam Railway,Rao, M.A. (1988). Indian Railways, New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.39 with its headquarters at Pandu.

Tillynaught was opened in 1859 by the Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway, and in 1867 was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway. This junction station was served by Aberdeen to Elgin trains as well as trains running to the branch terminus at Banff. In 1923 the Great North of Scotland Railway was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway and in 1948 became part of British Railways. Recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" the station closed completely on 6 May 1968. History =Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla= The old line to Portsoy near Tillynaight station. The Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway opened on 30 July 1859, with a line from Banff to Grange, on the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) main line, with a branch from Tillynaught to Portsoy. On 1 February 1863 the GNoSR took over services and the railway renamed the Banffshire Railway. =Moray Coast Line= A new station was built at Portsoy for the through line, which opened, together with a extension to Tochieneal, on 1 April 1884. The Countess of Seafield had not allowed a direct route to be built through Cullen House policies and to avoid the estate lands several bridges were and an impressive viaduct at Cullen had to be built. The Moray Coast Line opened on 1 May 1886, through Aberdeen to Elgin services called at Tillynaught. In 1923 the Great North of Scotland Railway was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway and railway nationalisation followed in 1948, services then being delivered by British Railways. The station and the line via Buckie was recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's in The Reshaping of British Railways, closed on 6 May 1968. =The station infrastructure= In 1866-7 the station apparently had no sidings, possessing an island platform and only two buildings indicated.Banffshire, Sheet X (includes: Alvah; Banff; Boyndie) Survey date: 1866-7. Publication date: 1871. By 1902 the junction had two signal boxes, a pedestrian footbridge, a weighing machine and a complex arrangement of sidings and points.Banffshire 010.01 (includes: Boyndie; Fordyce) Publication date: 1904. Revised: ca. 1902. The Tillnaught Junction signalling diagram for 1934 shows a single wooden signal box, two sidings on the Banff side and the sign stated Change for Ladysbridge and Banff. The island platform once had an impressive overall canopy that had been removed by 1960. After closure the station buildings were demolished and the platforms infilled. The nearby station master's house and ancillary houses have been converted into a private dwelling.Railscot Services Tillynaught had six trains a day to Portsoy after being taken over by the GNoSR, three of these reversed and continued to Banff. Tochieneal had services from when the line reached there in 1886. The Moray Coast Line was served by four through trains a day between Aberdeen to Elgin and these trains called at Tillynaught. Portsoy was served by four Aberdeen to Inverness trains in the summer of 1948, with a mid-day Keith Town to Inverness service and an evening service from Aberdeen that terminated at Elgin. There were three through services from Inverness to Aberdeen, a service from Lossiemouth and Elgin to Aberdeen and a Saturday service from Inverness to Keith that after 19 June was accelerated and extended to Aberdeen. There were no Sunday services.

She is known for her lifelong dedication to community service and for establishing programs that promote minorities in STEM fields, scientific research, and basic research.  Early life and education  Woods was born January 29, 1921, in West Palm Beach, Florida to Susie (King) and Oscar Pittman. In the fourth grade, Woods transferred from a private Episcopalian school to Industrial High School, the only public school in the area that allowed African-American students. She graduated from high school in 1938 and attended Talladega College, a historically black college in Talladega, Alabama. Neither of her parents had higher than an eighth grade education, and Woods's father died when she was a teenager, but her mother was very adamant about Woods doing well in school. Woods once stated: > \\"My mother paid for everything. She had a tremendous commitment to education > in general and my education in particular... Since she was always aware that > she never had the opportunity to get an education, she wanted me, her only > child, to have all the education I desired.\\" In 1940, Woods's mother fell ill and was admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. In order to be closer to her, Woods transferred to Howard University in Washington, D.C. At Howard University, Woods excelled in biology and other science classes. Dr. Louis Hansborough, a professor at Howard, encouraged her to continue studying embryology after graduation in 1942. Woods then attended a Radcliffe College and Harvard University partnership program to earn a master of science degree in 1943 and a Ph.D. in neuro-embryology in 1945. In 1945 she was also elected into Phi Beta Kappa, a national honors society, for her scholastic achievements.  Career  = 1940s-1950s = After earning her doctorate, Woods briefly took a position as an instructor at Howard University, her alma mater, until 1946. She then took a 25-year hiatus from science to focus on her family. = 1960s = Woods became heavily involved with local volunteering and community affairs, particularly those pertaining to minorities. Over time, her volunteer efforts expanded to national levels. Starting in 1963, she served a four-year term on the Personnel Board of the California Department of Employment. The following year, she became a member of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), an institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Later, in 1964, Dr. Geraldine P. Woods became the first African American woman appointed to the National Advisory General Medical Services (NAGMS) Council, an advisory board for NIGMS. In this position, she addressed the need to improve science education and research opportunities at minority institutions. In 1969 NIGMS appointed her as a special consultant, a highly revered position. She was a member of the Delta Sigma Theta, a historically African American sorority, for decades, and she served two terms as national president from 1963 to 1967. Under her leadership, in 1967 Delta Sigma Theta founded The Delta Research and Educational Foundation (DREF), a nonprofit that aids organizations with foundations in community service. Woods's feats in community development caught the eye of First Lady Claudia Alta Taylor \\"Lady Bird\\" Johnson in 1965, thus Woods was invited to the White House to help launch the Head Start Program, a US anti-poverty program, with Delta Sigma Theta. Then, in 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson himself appointed her Chairman of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a committee that aids women serving in the US Armed Forces. = 1970s = From 1968 through 1972 she continued her work in community service as the vice chair of the Community Relations Conference of Southern California. In 1972 two national programs Woods worked on at NIGMS, the Minority Access to Research Careers Program (MARC) and the Minority Biomedical Research Support Program (MBRS), were finally initiated, though she had trouble persuading administrators at Black colleges to get involved. At that point many were wary because of the long years they'd been out of the spotlight. As of 1978, Woods served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Howard University. During her tenure, she spoke at the dedication of Elizabeth Catlett's sculpture Students Aspire. = 1980s‚Äì1990s = By 1980 the MARC and MBRS had increased in popularity and hundreds of students were benefitting from the programs across the country. Along with her other notable leadership positions, Woods headed Howard University's Board of Trustees from 1975 to 1988. She eventually retired from the NIH and many of her leadership positions in 1991.  Awards and honors  Woods has earned numerous awards for her dedication to community service and minority rights, including the Mary Church Terrell Award of Delta Sigma Theta and the Scroll of Merit of the National Medical Association in 1979, the Howard University Achievement Award in 1980, and a Distinguished Leadership Achievement Award from the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education in 1987. In 1978, the sixth annual NIGMS Minority Biomedical Support (MBS) symposium held at the Atlanta University Center in Georgia was dedicated to Woods. The Federal City Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. recognized Woods's contributions to the sorority by establishing the Geraldine P. Woods Sciences Award in 1994. At the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) in 2003, NIGMS unveiled the Geraldine Woods Award because of her pivotal role in the development of the MBRS and MARC, two NIH minority programs. This award recognizes individuals who have had a significant impact in promoting the advancement of underrepresented minorities in biomedical science. A fellowship in biology at Howard University and one in chemistry at Atlanta University have both been established in her name. She has also earned honorary degrees at Benedict College, Talladega College, Fisk University, Bennett College, Meharry Medical College, and Howard University.  Personal life  During her time as an instructor at Howard, she met and married Robert Woods, a dentistry student at Meharry Medical College. After he graduated from dentistry school they moved to Los Angeles, California where Woods put her career on hold to raise their three children, Jan, Jerri, and Robert. Woods once said, \\"I was so busy 'driving' that I couldn't find time to research and write. But I think I made a lasting contribution to science nevertheless.\\" After a long illness Woods died on December 27, 1999 in her Aliso Viejo home.

Early life  Petroviƒá was born in Ba≈°ino Selo in Macedonia. Early in his life his family moved to Serbia where after five years at high school in Kragujevac and Belgrade he enrolled in 1871 at the Serbian Military Academy. Petroviƒá graduated as part of the class of 1875, and was commissioned with the rank of second lieutenant.  Military career  During the Serbian-Turkish Wars (1876-1878) Petroviƒá served first as the orderly officer of West Morava division (1876), then as a commander of a company. After the war he became the adjutant of the 1st Infantry Regiment. In 1881 Petroviƒá became aide to Prince Milan of Serbia becoming closely identified to the Obrenoviƒá dynasty. Most of his successes were to be attributed to his loyalty to the cause of King Milan and later his son, Aleksandar. In 1885 Petroviƒá became the commander of the 19th Infantry Battalion and as such served in the Serbo-Bulgarian War the same year. In 1887 he resigned from his post to become the head of Negotin County. He was reappointed to the army two years later and appointed to command the 7th Infantry Battalion. It was rumored that his temporary retirement into civilian life was only taken since Petroviƒá could not pass the exam for promotion to major but that he received that rank when he returned to the army as a high state official.S. C. ƒÜirkoviƒá, Siluete i karakteri, Nadimci starih Beograƒëana 1830-1940, Belgrade 1999, p. 51 In 1892 he became the Head of the Infantry Non Commissioned Officers‚Äô School. Petroviƒá closely supported the young king Aleksandar when on April 1, 1893 he overthrew the regency and took control of the kingdom.http://www.klubmonarhista.rs/kralj-aleksandar-obrenovic In 1895 Petroviƒá was promoted to the post of Commander of the Danube Infantry Regiment. However, in 1896 he was downgraded to the rank of commander of the 7th battalion again. From 1894 to 1896 he also taught tactics at Belgrade‚Äôs Military Academy.  Adjutant and death  In 1897-1898 he served as the adjutant of King Aleksandar Obrenoviƒá. After that he was sent as the Serbian military attach√© to Constantinople. He returned to the position of King‚Äôs Adjutant in 1901 and served as such until his death. Petroviƒá was on duty on the night when a military coup took place (see \\"May Overthrow\\"). A group of army officers formed a conspiracy and during the night of 10‚Äì11 June 1903 entered the royal palace in Belgrade with the intention of overthrowing the unpopular King Aleksandar and Queen Draga. After about two hours of confusion in the blacked-out building the royal couple were found in hiding and killed. Petroviƒá and other officers loyal to Aleksandar either died in exchanges of fire with the attackers or were shot after surrender. Petroviƒá's nickname in Belgrade was Lepi Laza (‚ÄúLaza the Pretty‚Äù).S.

English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, p.52 and built Helmsley Castle and Wark Castle and founded Kirkham Priory and Rievaulx Abbey. According to Pole (died 1635), the family of de Espec, de Spec, L'Espec, etc, held the manor of Wembworthy, Devon, from soon after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Within the manor was their manor house and estate called Heywood,Pole, p.424 today the site of New Eggesford House. According to Pole the Spekes were \\"Men of very great estate and condicion\\", and were powerful in early Norman England, as appears from the style used by members of the family in their grants of land and other charters, one of which (exemplified in the cartulary of Torre AbbeyPole, p.235) contains the following wording in Latin:Pole, p.235; Risdon, pp.140,295 :Ric(ard)us de Espeke balivis suis et omnibus hominibus suis Normanicis et Anglicis sal(utem). Sciatis me concessisse Osberto Probo et Michaeli fratri suo t(er)ram q(u)a(m) pater eor(um) de me tenuit in Daccombe et Wille, et volo quod Michaell et heredes sui de me teneant faciendo inde servicium duorum militum; et volo q(uo)d ita quiete teneant sicut frater eor(um) Will(ielmu)s tenuit die perex(i)it Jerusalem.

The family is remembered today in the parish of Wembworthy by the crossroads near the parish church known as Speke's Cross. According to Tristram Risdon (died 1640) from the reign of King Henry I (1100‚Äì1135) to that of King Henry III (1216‚Äì1272) the heads of the Speke family were named alternately William and Richard.Risdon, p.295 Wardship His father died in 1444 when John was aged 2, and his wardship and marriage were granted by the crown jointly toBurke's, 1937, p.2103; Watts, John, Henry VI and the Politics of Kingship, pp. 169‚Äì70, quoting Calendar of Patent Rolls 1436-41, pp.454,471 William de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk (1396‚Äì1450) (later Duke of Suffolk), William Waynflete (c. 1398 ‚Äì 1486), Provost of Eton (later Bishop of Winchester), and John Hampton (died 1472) of Kinver, Staffordshire, (whose monument was once in Kinver Church), Esquire of the Body to King Henry VI, all three of whom in 1442, together with others had been placed in charge of the foundation of Eton College by King Henry VI.See ; See also: Watts, John, Henry VI and the Politics of Kingship, pp. 169‚Äì70 It thus appears the revenue from his estates during his minority (until the age of 21) went towards the costs of establishing the king's foundation of Eton College.

As cabinet member responsible for higher education, he authored the 1982 university reform that introduced the departmental system as a replacement for the professorial chair system and that established graduate schools. Then in 1983-1985, as Greece‚Äôs first Minister of Research and Technology, he was instrumental in supporting the introduction of information technology and alternative energy, reorganizing the national research institutes, and establishing the system of centers of research innovation and excellence.  Early life  Born in Naoussa, northern Greece, in 1926. During the Axis occupation, he was active in the youth resistance group EPON. In 1953 he graduated from the National Technical University of Athens with a degree in mechanical and electrical engineering. He received a PhD from Imperial College London in 1956 in mechanical engineering with a specialty in plasticity.  Patras and dictatorship years  He had moved to the USA where he was professor of aerospace engineering at Purdue University with more than 75 publicationsGrandt, A. F., W. A. Gustafson and L. T.

April 1970. During this time, he first addressed the question of higher education reform in Greece. In 1964 he was invited to help organize at Patras, Greece, a new university incorporating a departmental system to replace the more hierarchical chair system then in use.Brousalis, E. ‚ÄúStructure and Function of the University of Patras.‚Äù To Vima [The Tribune], Sept. 3, 1966. This attempt at change ignited such overwhelming opposition, not only in the academy but also in the government itself, that any attempt at alteration was rejected.‚ÄúGovernment Ridicules Itself Over the University of Patras.‚Äù To Vima [The Tribune], Sept 6, 1966. The pursuit of reform was put on hold by the military dictatorship of 1967-1974. During this time in exile Lianis worked against the dictatorship, first as a member and later as the general secretary of the Panhellenic Liberation Movement (PAK) - North America. Upon the fall of the dictatorship he returned to Greece where he became professor in the chair of Mechanics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and head of PASOK - Thessaloniki.  Higher Education Reform of 1982  With the electoral victory of PASOK in 1981, Lianis joined the cabinet as Deputy Minister of Education in charge of Higher Education with the mission of enacting a substantial reform. In 1982, Framework Law 1268/82 was passed. It established a departmental system in place of the traditional academic chair, created four levels of staff, and specified channels of promotion based on qualification exclusively.Rokos, Dimitris. ŒùœåŒºŒøœÇ Œ†ŒªŒ±ŒØœÉŒπŒø 1268/82 Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒëŒΩœéœÑŒ±œÑŒ∑ Œ†Œ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ± [Framework Law 1268/82 and Higher Education]. Editions Enallaktikes, 2003. Graduate Schools were established with their own deans and faculties, and university self-governance grew to encompass junior staff and student participation. The new framework served to broaden the academic and administrative base of the university, including a less hierarchical structure and more opportunity for meritocratic advancement.In the traditional chair system, without the intermediary positions of assistant and associate professor, even highly talented younger scholars found it difficult to advance.

In 2011, Bryant founded Black Girls Code, a training course that teaches basic programming concepts to black girls who are underrepresented in technology careers. After founding Black Girls Code, Bryant has been listed as one of the \\"25 Most Influential African-Americans In Technology\\" by Business Insider. Early life and education Bryant was born and grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. She earned a degree in Electrical Engineering and minored in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. Career Bryant focused her studies at Vanderbilt on high-voltage electronics, and early in her career, she was hired at jobs at Westinghouse Electric and DuPont. Later, Bryant would move from electrical companies to biotechnology and later to pharmaceutical companies, where she worked at Pfizer, Merck, and at Genentech and Novartis. =Black Girls Code= Bryant founded Black Girls Code after her daughter expressed an interest in learning computer programming, and none of the available courses in the Bay area were well-suited for her: mostly boys, and rarely had other African American girls attending. Having experienced isolation herself during her time studying and working, she wanted a better environment for her daughter. Bryant hopes that this endeavor will allow young girls, especially those from minorities, to remain involved in STEM and increase awareness within the field. African-American women make up less than 3% of the workforce in the tech industry and Black Girls Code fights to change and improve this percentage for the better. Black Girls Code teaches computer programming to school-age girls in after-school and summer programs. The San Francisco-based nonprofit organization has a goal of teaching one million black girls to code by 2040. The organization already has trained 3,000 girls in seven chapters in cities in the United States, and has one chapter in Johannesburg, South Africa, with plans to add chapters in eight more cities. In August 2017 Bryant was involved with turning down a $125,000 donation by Uber which she considered \\"disingenuous\\". The donation followed allegations of sexual harassment at Uber. Bryant also noted in her refusal, that Girls Who Code was offered ten times the amount that was offered to Black Girls Code. In February 2018 Black Girls Code partnered with Uber's competitor Lyft - as Bryant considered their values to be better aligned with her own.http://www.blackenterprise.com/black-girls-code-lyft-uber/ =Recognition= In 2013, Bryant was recognized as a White House Champion of Change for Tech Inclusion.

History In 2007, prior to the formation of Head Records, Head opened its first store in a retail space vacated following the closure of the Fopp store in Leamington Spa. Head subsequently opened three further stores. The Bristol Broadmead Zavvi, which had been taken up by Head Entertainment in 2009, closed on 27 March 2010, but was reopened a week later by Head Records under the name \\"Head CD DVD Books\\". The store contains some new stock alongside ex Zavvi stock; the product range includes clothing, and a selection of books alongside CDs and DVDs. The former Zavvi store in Bromley was taken up by Head Records (as \\"Head CD & DVD\\"), some months after Head Entertainment had taken on its tranche of ex-Zavvi store sites. The Bromley store subsequently moved from the Zavvi site into another store location (a former Internacionale and previously Gamley's store), with the former Zavvi site being taken up by New Look. As with the Bristol store, the Bromley Head site carries a selection of new- release and catalogue products. In December 2010, a new Head Records store opened in Belfast's Victoria Square, becoming the fourth store in the chain. On 10 May 2011 Weston Mercury reported that Head was to open a new store in Weston-super-Mare's Sovereign Shopping Centre; this occupied a former Adams Childrenswear unit which had been used by HMV as a temporary store over Christmas 2010. On 14 May 2011 Head officially opened. Nick Cooke, centre manager of the Sovereign Shopping Centre, said, \\"We are delighted that Head have chosen to open in Weston, which for too long has missed a dedicated music retailer.\\" The WSM Head store had closed by early 2015, and in April 2015 the unit Head had occupied was taken up by a new Deichmann store. On 15 January 2012 Head Records store closed in Belfast's Victoria Square. On 14 July 2012 the Belfast store reopened for business at a new location on Ann Street. It has since relocated again to CastleCourt shopping centre. In September 2013 Head took up a presence in Warrington, hometown of Head founder Les Whitfield, when it began operating from premises in the Golden Square Shopping Centre, which had been vacated earlier that year by the closure of the town's store of HMV. Warrington's Head store closed in summer 2015 after HMV signed a deal to return to the same unit in Golden Square. The closure of the Warrington store reduced Head's estate to five stores. In October 2014 Blackburn became the site of the sixth store of Head Records, when the company opened a new store in the former HMV unit in the town. In January 2016, however, the store closed down, after the temporary lease expired. Consequently, Head shrunk to five stores once again. In March 2016 it was announced The Entertainer would take presence in the former unit. The store opened the following month. In 2015 the first store of Head Records opened in Wales, with the firm's opening of at Grand Arcade in the St. David's Shopping Development in Cardiff. On 22 December 2015, posters in the windows of the store in Bristol, revealed that the store would close for good on 8 January 2016, as well as a closing down sale. The closure of the store in Bristol meant the chain shrunk to four stores. In February 2016 the Leamington Spa store relocated to a new shop unit, opposite the shop unit they were currently in. The first Head store in the Republic of Ireland opened in the Liffey Valley shopping centre in Dublin in October 2016. In February 2017 it was announced that Head's store in Bromley would be closing. The decision follows the sale of The Glades to new owners at the end of 2016: ahead of the sale Head had agreed terms with the outgoing operator (intu Properties) for a new lease period - which would have seen the store receive a refit; however, after the sale the centre's new owners withdrew the offer of a new lease and let the unit to another operator - reported by Head founder Les Whitfield to be HMV, relocating from their existing Bromley premises at 90-92 High Street - with the Head store closing as a result. (HMV placed posters in their windows advertising relocation at around the same time as Head's closure announcement, though these confirmed only the closure of the current HMV - on 11 March - and did not give a new location or opening date for the new HMV store.) The relocated HMV will be staffed by employees of the existing HMV store, it's likely that current Head staff will lose their jobs as Head is not at this stage planning to relocate. Around this time, the company was registered in Ireland to Vivid Fusion Ltd - a new company established by Les and Jayne Whitfield and in England by Indulge Retail Limited. In May 2017, it was revealed that the retailer was intending to open a shop in St. John's Shopping Centre, Liverpool in August 2017. No news had surfaced after this, so the plans were very likely scrapped. In June 2017, the Cardiff store closed for the last time, leaving only three stores remaining. In August 2017, two new stores opened, both in the Republic of Ireland; one in Ilaic shopping centre, Dublin, the other in Corbett shopping centre, Galway city. On 4 January 2018, Vivid Fusion and Indulge Retail Limited both filed for liquidation, which led to all the Head stores closing down permanently on the same day. On 19 June 2018, The Leamington Spa store reopened for business in 8 Lower Mall, Royal Priors Shopping Centre, under the new management of Simon Dullenty.

Its Kickstarter campaign ended March 26, 2015 with a total funding of $1,766,205, surpassing its original $800,000 goal by $966,205. As of June 20, 2016 the total funding has reached $7,210,680 which includes an amount of $2,726,322 from pledges collected from both the Kickstarter campaign and donations taken on the Crowfall website. Gameplay The game will play similarly to most MMORPGs, with the camera in a third-person view with the player allowed to go anywhere. Where it differs is in the game's world system. There will be five systems of worlds, also known as campaigns. The systems will be \\"Eternal Kingdoms\\", \\"God's Reach\\", \\"The Infected\\", \\"The Shadow\\", and \\"Dregs\\", each with a different set of rules dictating them. Each world will also be procedurally generated, and will go through a cycle of life and death, starting with spring to summer, fall, and ending with winter. At the end of winter the campaign ends, and the world is gone forever, though the players will remain, allowed to travel to other worlds. Campaigns can last for 1, 3, or 6 months, to a year. The only worlds that don't die are the Eternal Kingdoms, where player housing is. There are a number of different characters or archetypes planned for the game consisting of a mixture of humans, demi-humans and animal- hybrids. The archetypes include Champion (melee dps), Ranger (specialist), Druid (support), Confessor (ranged dps), Knight (tank), Templar (tank), Forgemaster (specialist), Frostweaver (ranged dps), Assassin (specialist), Myrmidon (tank), Legionnaire (support), Duelist (specialist) and Stalker (ranged dps). At the start of a campaign (this is the MMORTS part), players will spawn in the newly created world during spring, filled with villages, mines, gatherable resources, and ruins. The world map is clouded by fog, meaning players will have to explore to discover its geography. With the resources they gather, players will be able to craft weapons and build castles and fortresses for defense against the other players and wildlife. As summer begins, resources become more scarce, and the world's monsters become more and more powerful. This continues with each season, the force doing this being called 'The Hunger' in the game's lore. Depending on the world, there will be a different set of campaign victory conditions, along with the rules of the world itself changing depending on the campaign. After the campaign is over, players may go back to their homes in the Eternal Kingdoms, where there are its own set of rules as well. Development The game was announced in January 2015 under much speculation and mystery. Very little information was given, with only a 40-day countdown timer and very few aspects of gameplay discussed on its website. When the counter finally reached zero, the site had a link to the game's official kickstarter page, with gameplay videos and many aspects of the game finally revealed. In a matter of hours, the Kickstarter was halfway towards its eight hundred thousand dollar goal.

The title is derived from the 1929 feature film The Broadway Melody. The cartoon, however, makes no references to the feature film. Plot At a subway station, Krazy tries to get a ride on a train. But before he could get aboard, numerous commuters come and quickly fill the carriages. By the time the commuters are in, Krazy is flat on his front. A station worker tries to help him by pushing those inside to make more space. But as Krazy attempts to come in, he is overtaken by more outside commuters. The jam-packed train leaves the station. Another train stops by moments later. This time Krazy chews some garlic pieces and blows a cloud wall which keeps the incoming commuters at bay. With this, Krazy boards the train with ease. But as he takes a seat, the commuters quickly come in until Krazy gets pushed out the door. Thankfully the station worker is generous to slip him back in. Krazy finally gets to ride as that train departs. Krazy's train is so full that its cars bulge almost to the point of bursting. Nevertheless, it remains in one piece. And although he manages to get a ride, Krazy has to avoid getting smushed by the passengers. When the train reaches its destination, the passengers come out flat, and a station employee has to inflate them with a pump. Krazy is in a worse situation as he is in pieces similar to a jigsaw puzzle. The station employee puts him back together on time.

The group was founded by former Black Flag vocalist Keith Morris and Redd Kross guitarist Greg Hetson. To date, Circle Jerks have released six studio albums, one compilation, a live album and a live DVD. Their debut album, Group Sex (1980), is considered a landmark of the hardcore genre. The band has broken up and re-formed several times, sometimes with different bassists and/or drummers. They disbanded for the first time after the release of their fifth album VI (1987), allowing Hetson to focus on Bad Religion (where he had been a member from 1984 to 2013) full-time. The Circle Jerks first reunited in 1994 and released their sixth and last studio album to date, Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, the following year before separating for the second time. The band reunited for the second time in 2001 and spent the next ten years performing live periodically; this reunion lasted for only one new song, \\"I'm Gonna Live\\", which was released on their MySpace profile in 2007. Tensions among its members and failed attempts to record the follow-up to Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities resulted in the Circle Jerks breaking up yet again in 2011. However, the band announced in November 2019 that they will reunite in 2020 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Group Sex with live shows. Many groups and artists have cited Circle Jerks as an influence, including Flea, Anti-Flag, Dropkick Murphys, the Offspring and Pennywise. History =Early days and increasing popularity (1979‚Äì1982)= Lead vocalist Keith Morris was an original member of Black Flag, co-founding the band with guitarist Greg Ginn and recording the Nervous Breakdown EP with them before suddenly departing the group in December 1979. Morris formed Circle Jerks as the Bedwetters along with guitarist Greg Hetson, bassist Roger Rogerson (a classically-trained guitarist) and drummer Lucky Lehrer (a jazz-trained drummer). Lehrer did not like the name the Bedwetters, so Morris looked through a dictionary of slang words and renamed the band the Circle Jerks. The band's first recordings took place in spring 1980, including the original version of \\"Wild in the Streets\\", which appeared on Posh Boy's first Rodney on the ROQ compilation. In July of that year, the band recorded their debut studio album, Group Sex, which was released in October 1980 on the Frontier Records label; its 14 songs totaled just 15 minutes. The album featured several songs that Morris had written while in Black Flag. That same year, the group was one of several California punk bands to be immortalized in the Penelope Spheeris documentary The Decline of Western Civilization; live versions of five songs from Group Sex appeared on the movie's soundtrack. In late 1980, the group signed with IRS Records subsidiary Faulty Products and recorded their second album, Wild in the Streets, released in 1982. The title track was a cover version of a song by Garland Jeffreys. Faulty Products ceased operations several months after its release, forcing Circle Jerks to seek their third record deal in as many years. While they regained the copyright to Wild in the Streets, the original stereo master tape was lost, forcing the band to remix it from the multi-track tapes when they reissued the album in 1988. =Later years (1983‚Äì1989)= They signed a management deal with War producer/manager Jerry Goldstein's Far Out Productions, and recorded their third album, Golden Shower of Hits, in 1983. The album was released on Goldstein's LAX Records label. The title track was a medley of six cover versions (of artists as diverse and unexpected as the Association, the Carpenters and Tammy Wynette) strung together to create a storyline of two people who fall in love, have an unplanned pregnancy, rush into marriage and end up divorced. Another song from the album, \\"Coup d'√âtat\\", was used in the soundtrack of Alex Cox's 1984 film Repo Man, which the band appeared in, playing an acoustic lounge version of \\"When the Shit Hits the Fan,\\" featuring new members Chuck Biscuits (formerly of Black Flag and D.O.A.) on drums and Earl Liberty (formerly of Saccharine Trust) on bass. Biscuits and Liberty were eventually replaced by Keith Clark and Zander Schloss (who also appeared in Repo Man), respectively. The band also changed labels for the fourth time, signing a deal with Relativity Records' metal imprint Combat Records, which had started a punk sub-label, Combat Core. The newly revamped group recorded Wonderful, released in 1985. Their newfound stability allowed the lineup to record a second album for Relativity, VI, issued in 1987. One track from VI, \\"Love Kills\\", had been commissioned by Cox for the soundtrack of the 1986 movie Sid and Nancy, and was heard in the film. Chris Poland played bass with Circle Jerks briefly circa 1989 after being fired as guitarist for Megadeth (Schloss had left the band by that point). =Hiatus (1990‚Äì1993)= Circle Jerks dissolved in 1990 after Hetson left the band to continue recording with Bad Religion. Live recordings made during what would be their final tour at the time were immortalized in the live album Gig in 1992, their third and last release for Relativity. During the hiatus, Hetson would continue playing in Bad Religion; Schloss played guitar and bass with various acts; Clark initially retired from music; Morris worked menial jobs and battled health problems (he had kicked a longtime dependence on drugs and alcohol in 1988). =Reunions and hiatuses (1994‚Äì2011)= A long period of inactivity for Circle Jerks ended in 1994, when the Wonderful-era lineup reunited and signed a major label deal with Mercury Records, a move that had a few business complications: Hetson was still with Bad Religion, who had signed a long-term contract with Atlantic Records, while Schloss had been part of a band contracted to Interscope Records. After ironing out these difficulties, the band recorded their final studio album to date, Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, released June 20, 1995. One track on the album, a cover of the Soft Boys' \\"I Wanna Destroy You\\", featured backing vocals from pop singer/songwriter Deborah Gibson, who had just finished a solo album with the same producer that Circle Jerks were using. Gibson later made a surprise appearance at Circle Jerks' performance at punk mecca CBGB to perform \\"I Wanna Destroy You\\" with the band. Despite such media attention, the group suddenly imploded three weeks into a tour behind the album. The breakup would not be totally permanent, with the Jerks playing sporadically throughout the late 1990s, but Clark left music for good afterward. Original bassist Rogerson died in 1996 of a drug overdose. He was 41 years old. Further Circle Jerks activity was suddenly held up when Morris announced that he had been diagnosed with adult onset diabetes in 1999. A multitude of punk bands held benefits on his behalf. The core of Morris, Hetson and Schloss, with drummer Kevin Fitzgerald, continued to tour until 2011, in between other commitments ‚Äî Hetson was still a full-time member of Bad Religion, Schloss played bass for the reformed first-generation LA punk band the Weirdos, and Morris was an A&R; director for V2 Records until the label was suddenly shuttered by its owners in 2007. In 2004, the Circle Jerks shot a live concert DVD as part of Kung-Fu Records' live DVD series The Show Must Go Off!, in which the band played songs from all six of their studio albums, plus ‚Äì in nods to Schloss' other current band and Morris' first band, respectively ‚Äì covers of the Weirdos' \\"Solitary Confinement\\" and Black Flag's \\"Nervous Breakdown\\". In 2005, Hetson formed another band, Black President. For several years, a rumored Circle Jerks album featuring new material was said to be imminent, although no further formal announcement was made. In late February 2007, the band released their first new song since 1995 on their Myspace page, titled \\"I'm Gonna Live\\", adding more anticipation to the possibility of a new album emerging. However, in an April 2008 interview, guitarist Hetson admitted that Circle Jerks would not release any new studio material, saying that he does not know what will happen in the future, \\"but in the near future, no Circle Jerks stuff will come out\\". Circle Jerks were featured on a television commercial for XM Satellite Radio (they were the first band played in the commercial, which included \\"Operation\\" from the album Group Sex), and the band also posted a cover of Germs song \\"The Slave\\" on their Myspace page. The Circle Jerks played their final show for nearly a decade at the Bluebird Theater in Denver on January 27, 2011. From 2011 to 2019, the Circle Jerks were on hiatus due to a dispute between Morris and the rest of the band. The conflict was over songs that were written by Morris and Dimitri Coats. Coats (from Burning Brides), who was supposed to produce a new Circle Jerks album, decided that the songs Hetson had written were not up to par with Circle Jerks' catalog. Morris agreed, and both he and Coats wrote multiple songs intended for the new album. The other members of Circle Jerks believed Coats to be \\"arrogant, overbearing, egotistical\\" and called for him to be fired from producing the new record. Morris disagreed, and he and Coats recruited Steven Shane McDonald (from Redd Kross) and Mario Rubalcaba (Rocket from the Crypt, Hot Snakes, 411, Clikatat Ikatowi, Earthless) to start a new band called Off!. =Group Sex anniversary shows (2019‚Äìpresent)= On November 22, 2019, it was announced that the Circle Jerks were going to reunite in 2020 for a number of shows by celebrating the 40th anniversary of their debut album Group Sex, including that year's Punk Rock Bowling. Then COVID-19 struck and caused performances to be postponed until 2021. Three-fourths of the final lineup ‚Äì Keith Morris, guitarist Greg Hetson, bassist Zander Schloss ‚Äì will be involved in the reunion, with a drummer currently to be determined.

He was Chairman of the British Medical Association in the late 1970s to early 1980s, and was a member of the General Medical Council for twenty years. Early life Grabham was born on 19 July 1930 in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England. His father was a police inspector and his grandfather was a firefighter who was head of the fire brigades of North East England. Career =Military service= In 1954, Grabham began a period of National Service with the British Army. He was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps as a lieutenant on 25 April 1954. He was promoted to captain on 3 August 1955. On 14 August 1956, he was transferred to the Territorial Army and granted the rank of captain with seniority from 3 August 1955. On 6 June 1957, he was transferred to the Army Emergency Reserve of Officers, thereby ending his military service. During his military service, he served as a Regimental Medical Officer. He completed two overseas posting: one to Celle, West Germany, and the other to Derna, Libya. =Medical career= Graham became a general surgeon at the age of 34 years, who also wrote on medico-politics for the British medical Journal. He qualified from Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. On returning from Libya as a medical officer, he took up a surgical post in kettering. Honours In the 1988 New Year Honours, it was announced that Grabham had been appointed a Knight Bachelor and therefore granted the title sir. On 9 February 1988, he was knighted at Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II.

It is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia and common in most of its range. Description Calectasia narragara is an undershrub without stilt roots but with a short rhizome from which it is able to form clones. The roots are clustered, wiry and sand-binding. It grows to a height of about with many very short side branches. Each leaf blade is glabrous except sometimes at the margins, long, wide tapering to a short, sharp point on the end. The base of the petals (strictly tepals) form a tube long, which, unlike most others in the genus (but not C. hispida), is glabrous. The outer part of the petals are blue with bronze margins and spread outwards to form a papery, star-like pattern which fades to white with age. In the centre of the star are six yellow stamens forming a tube which turns orange-red with age. The thin style sometimes extends beyond the stamens. It is similar to the other species of Calectasia and is distinguished from them by a combination of the presence of a short, compact rhizome, lack of stilt leaves, the glabrousness of the leaf blades and the change in colour of the petals and stamens with age. Flowers mostly appear from June to September. Swan View Calectasia narragara older flower with red stamens Taxonomy and naming Calectasia narragara is one of eleven species in the genus Calectasia. It was described as a new species in 2001 by R.L. Barrett and K.W. Dixon from a specimen collected in Kings Park, near the nature trail, 0.5 km west of the Roe Memorial. (The Roe Memorial commemorates John Septimus Roe, Western Australia's first surveyor-general.) The specific epithet (narragara) is a composite Nyoongar name for a star, chosen for the common name of \\"Star of Bethlehem\\" which has often been applied to this species. Distribution and habitat This species of blue tinsel lily is widespread and common within 80 kilometres of the coast on the Swan Coastal Plain and Darling Scarp from Busselton north to Geraldton, in the South West Botanical Province. It usually grows in a wide range of vegetation associations and habitats, including kwongan, woodland on white, grey or yellow sand and occasionally in swampy areas. Conservation status Calectasia narragara is classified as not threatened.

Characteristics Geum talbotianum is a small conspicuous herb characterized by broad kidney shaped leaves (5‚Äì10 cm wide) which are wrinkled on the upper surface. The leaves are covered in a layer of fine hairs and protrude on stalks from the base of the plant. Flowers are large (4‚Äì5 cm across) and white, appearing on the ends of long peduncles in late December to early March. Fruits are a red, fleshy berry Distribution Distribution of Geum talbotianum in Tasmania (As per Threatened Species Unit records, June 2003). The distributional range of G. talbotianum is limited to high alpine areas in Southwest Tasmania. Here it can be found sheltering from the harsh weather in cracks and crevices provided by rocky outcrops. Some key locations where this species can be found are Adamsons Peak, Mt Anne, Western Arthurs, Mt La Perouse, Mt Piction and the Devils Backbone in the Hartz Mountains National Park Threats Geum talbotianum is listed as rare under the Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. Due to its limited distribution G. talbotianum is particularly vulnerable to both anthropological and natural threats. Some of these include: *Increased temperatures resulting from climate change reducing suitable alpine habitat and contracting the plants distributional range. *Fire events decimating the population at a particular site. *Trampling from outdoor recreationalists destroying individuals.

Oveta Fuller is an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at University of Michigan Medical School. She specializes in research of Herpes simplex virus, as well as HIV/AIDS. Dr.Fuller and her research team discovered a B5 receptor, advancing the understanding of Herpes simplex virus and the cells it attacks. In 2014, she was named associate director of the University of Michigan African Studies Center. Early life and education Dr. Fuller was born on August 31, 1955 in Mebane, North Carolina. Deborah Woods Fuller, her mother was a teacher and her father Herbert R. Fuller managed the family farm. Dr.Fuller grew up near Yanceyville, North Carolina where she was the middle child of three. As a child biology intrigued her at an early age. She was amazed how her grandmother recovered quickly from being bitten by a water moccasin after receiving antivenin, which was an antidote for snake venom. Although her grandmother snake bite contribute to her likeness for biology, there was also two notable biology teachers, Ms. Elam and Mr. Majette who inspired her as well. After graduating from high school, she earned an Aubrey Lee Brooks Scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which she received a BA in biology in 1977. Dr. Fuller continued her education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to complete her Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology in 1983. Career In 1983 Dr. Fuller attended the University of Chicago for a postdoctoral fellowship and was supported by numerous fellowships, including Ford Postdoctoral Fellowship, Ann Fuller Cancer Fund Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, and a National Institutes of Health Postdoctoral Fellowship. In 1988 Dr.Fuller became faculty member at University of Michigan Medical School as an assistant professor in the department of Microbiology and Immunology. In 1995 she was promoted to associate professor with tenure. Dr. Fuller also served as a faculty associate for the Center for Global Health, STEM Initiative, and African Studies Center at the University of Michigan. She is currently the associate professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Medical School and faculty in the STEM Initiative of the African Studies at the University of Michigan. Dr. Fuller is the pastor at Bethel African Methodist Episocopal Church in Adrian, Michigan. She is the science advisor at the global AME Church and adjunct faculty member at Payne Theological Seminary, which she teaches a biology course on HIV/AIDS.  Research  Dr. Fuller's research focuses on uncovering the molecular mechanisms of how pathogenic viruses enter and infect cells. Specifically, her lab studies the pathogenesis of herpes and HIV/AIDS viruses. She is interested in understanding the modes of action of viral cellular entry and early infection, such as membrane fusion mechanisms. Additionally, Fuller's lab is part of a collaborative effort with chemical engineering and human genetic researchers to develop microchip technologies for early, quick, and inexpensive methods of viral infection detection. Beyond the lab, Dr. Fuller has an extensive research program working with the Trusted Messenger Intervention (TMI) program to recruit the help of local religious leaders to address health inequalities with a main focus on HIV/AIDS testing, prevention, and treatment. She has successfully implemented this program within communities in Zambia and the US and more recently has introduced new programs in other countries, including Liberia where the focus has been on preventable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Ebola virus disease. Awards and recognition Dr. Fuller received numerous awards throughout her career, in addition to the many fellowships she received as a postdoctoral fellow. In 1983 she was awarded the National Technical Association Service Award, Anna Fund Postdoctoral Award, and Thornton Professional Achievement Award. In 1987, she was also awarded the Ford Foundation fellowship and in 1992 she was awarded the NSF Career Advancement Award. Dr.Fuller other awards includes the Woman of the Year in Human Relations by the University of Michigan Task Force (1998) her service with the Distinguished Service Award in Microbiology and Ministry from the Missions Society, AME, the Robert Smith Community Service \\"Humanitarian Award,\\" and her biography was highlighted in \\"Distinguished African American Scientists of the 20th Century\\" (Kessler, Kidd, and Morin, Oryx Press, Phoenix, AZ, 1996). In 2012, she received a Fulbright US Scholar Program award. In January 2013 she began nine months of research in the Copperbelt region in Zambia, which her work focused on bringing biomedical information into communities through local religious leaders.

Collins was nicknamed the ‚ÄúTermite Lady‚Äù because of her extensive research on termites. Together with David Nickle, Collins identified a new species of termite called Neotermes luykxi. When Collins earned her PhD., she became the first African American female entomologist and the third African American female zoologist. Life summary Collins was born in 1922 in Institute, West Virginia. She started college at age fourteen and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from West Virginia State University in 1943. Her Doctor of Philosophy degree was awarded by the University of Chicago in 1950, becoming only the third Black woman zoologist in the country. Her mentor was Alfred E. Emerson. Her dissertation was Difference in toleration of drying between species of termites (Reticulitermes), with an article based on this work in Ecology, the journal of the Ecological Society of America. Collins taught at Florida A&M; University and at Howard University. She saw herself primarily as a field scientist, and did extensive field work in North and South America, specializing in the insects of Guyana and Florida. From the late 1970s through 1996, Collins was a research associate in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, Department of Entomology. Her primary area of study was termites of the Caribbean. Her life's research regarding termites included: the evolution of desiccation resistance in termites; various termite species' tolerance of high temperatures; defensive behavior in South American termites, including chemical defenses; termite ecology; species abundance in virgin and disturbed tropical rain forests; and behavioral ecology, taxonomy, and entomology. She was also an active civil rights advocate, receiving a bomb threat for planning to give a university talk on biology and equality, and being followed by the police and FBI when she was a volunteer driver during a bus boycott. Her activism limited her scientific work for a time: she had been publishing a scientific paper or two a year, but had no publications between 1952 and 1957. She led a 1979 AAAS symposium in Houston, later published as Science and the Question of Human Equality. Collins was still doing research when she died at age 73 on April 27, 1996, in the Cayman Islands. She died of heart failure, and, as she had hoped to, while on a field trip.  Early life  Margaret S. Collins was born on September 4, 1922, in Institute, West Virginia. Collins was the fourth child of Rollins James and Luella Bolling James. Institute was described as an all-Black town and a college town. As a result, there were many educated Black people in Institute, West Virginia. Collins's father, Rollins James, earned his bachelor's degree from West Virginia State University and his master's degree from Tuskegee Institute, both historically Black universities. With these degrees, James worked with George Washington Carver for a while. James then taught Vocational Agriculture at West Virginia State, ran the poultry program at West Virginia State, taught at West Virginia State's laboratory high school, and was a county agent for the UDSA. Collins's mother, Luella James, wanted to become an archaeologist but her studies at West Virginia State were limited because of her gender; she later dropped out of college. From an early age Collins was fascinated by zoology. Inspired by naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton‚Äôs books, Two Little Savages and Rolf in the Woods, Collins would explore the woods and barn near her childhood home in order to collect insects. When Collins was just 6 years old, she was recognized as a child prodigy; as a result of this achievement, she was given access to the book collections at West Virginia State University's Library. Collins's impressive intellect and university level reading skill allowed her to skip two grades and graduate high school early. At 14 years old, Collins graduated from West Virginia State University's Laboratory High School.  Education  After her early graduation from West Virginia State College's Laboratory High School, Collins continued her education until she received a PhD in zoology in 1950. In 1936 Collins started her first year at West Virginia State University, a historically Black university, on an academic scholarship. Collins faced a lot of difficulties as an undergraduate at West Virginia State University due to her gender. She struggled to find a mentor in Biology, which was a predominantly male- dominated field. Collins eventually received mentorship from Toye Davis and Frederick Lehner, who were both professors at West Virginia State University. Together Davis and Lehner helped find Collins opportunities in the field of Biology. In 1943, Collins gained her Bachelor of Science degree in Biology with minors in Physics and German. Later in 1943 Collins enrolled in the University of Chicago graduating in 1950 with a PhD in zoology. Alfred E. Emerson, a termite expert, mentored Collins at the University of Chicago. Emerson assisted Collins in her studies and shielded her from racism; but he did not let her do fieldwork because he thought women were irritating during scientific expeditions. Emerson helped Collins develop and complete her dissertation, Differences in Toleration of Drying among Species of Termites (Reticulitermes). Collins's dissertation is well regarded in the field of entomology and is cited very often. Collins also wrote an article based on her dissertation in Ecology, the journal of the Ecological Society of America. When Collins received her PhD., she became the third African-American female zoologist and the first African-American female entomologist.  Career and advocacy for racial equality  Collins was employed as an assistant professor at Howard University in Washington, District of Columbia while her first husband, Bernard Strickland attended Howard University's Medical School. Collins later divorced Strickland and left Howard University because it did not treat its women and men faculty members equally. She started working for Florida A&M; University and while there married her second husband Herbert L. Collins. They had two sons. Collins was appointed a full-time professor at Florida A&M;, becoming chair of the Biology department in 1953. She often went on collecting trips in Everglades National Park with her family. During her time in Florida, Collins was invited to guest lecture at a local predominantly White university on Biology and equality. The lecture was cancelled due to a bomb threat. Collins also volunteered to drive people to work during the Florida A&M; Student Council's bus boycott. Collins was watched closely by the police and the FBI because of her actions against racial inequality. Collins's advocacy for equal rights limited her scientific work from 1952 to 1957 and she did not publish any papers at this time. Collins applied for and received a grant from the National Science Foundation to study at the University of Minnesota for a year. From 1961 to 1962, Collins was a research associate at the Minnesota Agricultural Experimental Station in St. Paul where she studied North American termites. In 1964, Collins moved backed to Washington, D.C., and returned to Howard University as a full-time professor. Collins also took a tenured position at Federal City College (now known as University of District of Columbia) for ten years. Additionally, Collins became president of the Entomological Society of Washington during her time in Washington, D.C., and a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution. In 1968, with grants from the Smithsonian and the Graduate School of Howard University, Collins led an expedition to Mexico. In 1972 she took a research trip to the Sonoran Desert in Arizona which was supported by the United States IBP Desert Biome Project and the National Science Foundation. In the same year, Collins was invited to the Clark Lectureship at Scripps College; Collins lectured about her research and experiences. While involved in field research in Guyana, Collins reopened the Alfred Emerson Research Station in 1979. Also, in 1979 Collins orchestrated a symposium for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The symposium's focus was on Science and the Question of Human Equality. After the symposium she published a book with the same title as the symposium's focus, Science and the Question of Human Equality. 1979 was a very busy year for Collins because she also started researching the defense mechanism of termites with Glenn D. Prestwich. From the late 1970s to 1996, Collins researched termites in the Caribbean through the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, Department of Entomology, especially the termites of Guyana. During these expeditions, Collins informed Guyana's military of ways to build that would avoid termite damage and how to use termite excretions to strengthen building materials. Collins contributed greatly to the Smithsonian's termite collection. The materials she collected were curated as the Collins Collection at the National Museum of Natural History.  Research and discoveries  Collins saw herself primarily as a field scientist and did extensive field work in North and South America, specializing in the insects of Guyana and Florida. With her colleague David Nickle, Dr. Collins discovered a new species of termite called Neotermes luykxi, or the Florida damp wood termite, in 1989. This species of termite is native to Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In Florida these termites are primarily distributed from eastern Broward County to Key Largo. Collins researched the evolution of desiccation resistance in termites, tolerance to high temperature, and species abundance in virgin and disturbed tropical rain forests. She also researched defense behavior in South American termites, chemical defense of termites, termite ecology, behavioral ecology, taxonomy, and entomology.  Later years  Although she had health problems during the 1980s and the 1990s, Collin's increased her work in the field, taking various expeditions to the Caribbean. On April 27, 1996, Collins died at the age of 73 at Southern Cross Club in Little Cayman, Cayman Islands on an expedition due to congestive heart failure.  Selected published works  * Collins, M.

The term fluids includes liquids or gases, but also may refer to materials that behave with fluid-like properties, including crowds of people or large numbers of grains if those are describable approximately under the continuum hypothesis as used in continuum mechanics. Unsteady and convective effects The composition of the material contains two types of terms: those involving the time derivative and those involving spatial derivatives. The time derivative portion is denoted as the local derivative, and represents the effects of unsteady flow. The local derivative occurs during unsteady flow, and becomes zero for steady flow. The portion of the material derivative represented by the spatial derivatives is called the convective derivative. It accounts for the variation in fluid property, be it velocity or temperature for example, due to the motion of a fluid particle in space where its values are different. Acceleration field The acceleration of a particle is the time rate of change of its velocity. Using an Eulerian description for velocity, the velocity field V = V(x,y,z,t), and deriving it with respect to time, we obtain the acceleration field.

It was the last of his vocal compositions, completed two years before his death. The songs are brief and a performance of the set usually lasts less than five minutes. Songwriting occupied Satie sporadically throughout his life.Among Satie's earliest published works was his Trois Melodies of 1886, when he was 20. Apart from solo piano music he was more productive in this genre than any other, creating some 30 original songs and arrangements for dozens of popular tunes. He produced popular hits for the music hall (Je te veux, La Diva de l'Empire) as well as m√©lodies (French art songs) for more discriminating audiences. In the Ludions he fused both genres with the irreverent spirit characteristic of his later music. Biographer Pierre-Daniel Templier called the cycle \\"one of Satie's most successful works, due to the perfect correlation between the inspiration of the poet and that of the musician. The familiar playfulness of Fargue's poems, their childish rhythms, their humorous nostalgia, are all delicately rendered by Satie...the irony shines through very clearly.\\"Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, p. 104. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932. Background L√©on-Paul Fargue by Henri Rousseau, 1896 The eccentric poet, journalist and fl√¢neur L√©on-Paul Fargue (1876-1947) has been described as perhaps Satie's \\"nearest counterpart in literature.\\"Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 58. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. Both men were linked with various Parisian avant-garde movements but remained fiercely independent; both drew on absurd humor and childhood as sources of creative inspiration; and they delighted in wordplay and nocturnal strolls around Paris, a city they knew well. During the World War I years the composer became part of Fargue's intimate circle, the \\"Potassons\\", who gathered at Adrienne Monnier's bookshop La Maison des Amis des Livres for readings of his work. Monnier was fascinated with their unusual intellects and recalled that at that time Satie was to Fargue \\"what the Tashi Lama is to the Dalai Lama.\\"Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 164. Satie set Fargue's poem La statue de bronze to music in his cycle Trois M√©lodies (1916), and the following year Fargue testified as a character witness in Satie's defense during his prosecution for libel for sending insulting postcards to a music critic. The Ludions would be the chief testament of their friendship - and the cause of its acrimonious end. Composition history Fargue first published the Ludions as a series of eight poems in the March 1923 edition of Monnier's house journal Intentions.See Robert Orledge, Preface to Soundkiosk edition of the Ludions, 2011, p. 8. http://www.soundkiosk.com/pdffiles/Sample%20book%20web%20Vol%203.pdf Satie was then under commission to provide music for Count √âtienne de Beaumont's upcoming costume ball, an annual Parisian high society event to which he and Fargue (as leading avant-gardists) were regularly invited, and he happily seized on his friend's idiosyncratic verses to add to the program. For his setting Satie omitted three of the poems (Air de Julienne, Lanterne and Merdrigal) and rearranged the order of the rest, shifting the Chanson du chat from first to last place to give the cycle a cheerful ending. No changes were made to the texts themselves. The Air du rat gave Satie the most difficulty - he rewrote the song three times before he was satisfied with it.Orledge, Soundkiosk, p. 8. One of Satie's tasks for the Beaumont f√™te was to help showcase the newly restored 18th Century pipe organ the Count had installed at his Paris mansion. The two musical numbers he composed for the event - the danced divertissement La statue retrouv√©e and the Ludions - were to be performed on this instrument. Dismissing fears it would bring a somber note to the festivities, the composer wrote to Countess Edith de Beaumont, \\"The organ isn't necessarily religious & funereal...Just remember the gilt-painted merry- go-round.\\"Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 161. Satie's notebooks show he originally conceived the accompaniments for piano, from which he then created separate organ arrangements for the private premiere.Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, pp. 326-327. The Ludions were completed on May 15, 1923, two weeks before Beaumont's masquerade was due to take place. The songs A ludion, known in English as a Cartesian diver, is a tiny figurine used as a scientific toy. Placed in a water-filled container that is then made airtight, it can be made to rise, sink and spin by applying external pressure to the liquid. In Fargue's time ludions were often crafted in the forms of devils or imps. Robert Orledge observed that \\"Fargue's poems are as important for their sounds and word-play as they are for their literal meanings.\\"Orledge, Soundkiosk, p. 8. Laden with puns, deformed words, obscure allusions and baby talk, they are almost untranslatable. A blown glass devil ludion :1. Air du rat (Rat's Tune) - G major - Tranquille :A mock dirge, set to a poem Fargue wrote at age 10 on the death of his pet white rat. :There is a fragile tone of lament in the vocal line for the opening verses, hinting at the :sadness beneath the author's juvenile terms of endearment for his little friend. :2. Spleen - C minor - Mod√©r√© :The most serious of the songs portrays a jaded blonde prostitute, sitting like \\"an ocean of :ill-will\\" on a bench in a public square. Following a chorale-like piano introduction, the music builds by :sometimes hesitant steps up to its emphatic climax on the concluding verse, \\"I'm bored in this :cabaret of nothingness which is our life.\\" :3. La grenouille am√©ricaine (The American Frog) - A‚ô≠ major - Mouvt. de Marche :Spry music hall march rhythms accompany this childhood vignette of Fargue being ogled by his pet :\\"fwog\\". The poet calls it \\"A love scene.\\" :4. Air du po√®te (Poet's Tune) - F minor - Grave :On the shores of Papua, the poet makes love to a Papuan and then wishes the :person wasn't Papuan. A languid pentatonic melody suggests the exotic setting and lends an ironic :gravitas to the text, a bit of nonsense in which Fargue spins variations on the French :word \\"Papouasie.\\" :5. Chanson du chat (Cat's Song) - F major - Gaiement :Fargue wrote this poem in honor of his obese cat Potasson, for whom his friends jokingly nicknamed :themselves. Satie's setting is a cabaret-style parody, borrowing the tune of the traditional French :children's song Comp√®re Guilleri for the vocal line.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 203. Fargue's \\"Potassons\\" subsequently adopted the Chanson du chat as their anthem.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 221. Premiere and aftermath The former Beaumont mansion in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, where the private premiere of the Ludions took place The Ludions were first performed as part of the extravagant \\"Baroque Ball\\" Beaumont held at his home at 2 rue Duroc in Paris on May 30, 1923. Marguerite Jacquemaire (later Countess Marie-Blanche de Polignac) was the soprano soloist, with composer Germaine Tailleferre, the lone female member of Les Six, at the organ. Satie found Jacquemaire's voice \\"angelic\\"Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 163 and Igor Stravinsky reportedly admired the cycle's \\"perfect word-setting.\\"Henri Sauget, \\"Quelques extraits des souvenirs\\", La Revue Musicale, 361-3, 1983, pp. 247-249. Translated by Roger Nichols and reprinted in Robert Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", Faber and Faber Ltd., 1995, p. 210. For the creators, however, the occasion had already been marred by backstage drama. During a rehearsal on May 29, Fargue noticed that his name had been inadvertently left off the printed program as author of the Ludions. He flew into a rage at Satie (whom he blamed for the oversight) and Beaumont, prompting the Count to challenge him to a duel. \\"All right,\\" replied Fargue, \\"but since I'm the offended party I have the right to choose the weapons, and I choose spelling.\\"Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 164. Beaumont backed down, but a week later an unmollified Satie sent Fargue a curt note demanding an apology. Sylvia Beach recalled his response: \\"As usual, in Fargue's feuds, he spent a good deal of time and took a lot of trouble to write the most dreadfully insulting things he could think of in daily letters to Satie. Not satisfied with mailing them in Paris, he would go all the way to Arcueil-Cachan, where Satie lived,10 kilometers (6.2 miles) south of Paris. to slip another insulting note under his door.\\"Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 164. The hand-delivery showed a particular malice: Satie allowed no one to visit his squalid apartment in Arcueil for the 27 years he lived there,Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 26.Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 70. and those who knew him kept their distance out of respect for his privacy.Robert Caby recalled how, as a teenaged admirer in 1924, he impulsively made the trek to Satie's Arcueil lodgings one Sunday afternoon. The composer wasn't home. He added, \\"I was na√Øve enough to tell him about my visit. He was duly astonished, but did not break off our relationship.\\" Caby, commemorative essay of Satie in Le Figaro litt√©raire, June 24, 1950, p. 6. Reprinted in Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", p. 64. He and Fargue soon cut off all communication with each other. Ironically, Satie himself was notorious for ending friendships over slight and even imaginary offenses,Satie disowned one friend for inadvertently taking his piece of bread during a meal, and another for accidentally damaging one of his beloved umbrellas. See Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 111.\\"Les Six\\" composer Georges Auric, with whom Satie fell out in 1924, believed he had \\"a definite persecution complex.\\" See Auric, \\"Inoubliable apparition d'Erik Satie\\", Quand J'Etais l√†, Paris, 1979, pp. 21-32. Reprinted in Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", p. 113-17. and the break with Fargue was a rare instance of the tables being turned on him. According to Beach, Satie could only laugh about it.Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p 164. The Ludions were publicly premiered at the Salle des Agriculteurs in Paris on December 21, 1923. Satie accompanied mezzo-soprano Jane Bathori in his original setting of the songs for voice and piano, and this version became standard. One of Satie's final acts as a professional musician, on his deathbed in a Paris hospital in 1925, was to sign a contract with Jacques Lerolle of Rouart, Lerolle & Cie for the publication of the Ludions. Lerolle urged Fargue to visit the dying composer, to no avail; nor did the poet attend Satie's funeral in July.Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", pp. 164-165. The songs were issued in 1926. Fargue re-published his complete texts as an illustrated booklet in 1930. In later years he wrote of Satie as \\"a true master\\" and privately remembered him with relish.Andr√© Beucler, \\"Poet of Paris: Twenty years with L√©on-Paul Fargue\\", Chatto & Windus, London, 1955, pp. 56-57.

Malcom graduated from George Washington Carver High School at the age of 16 and left home to earn a B.S. with distinction in zoology at the University of Washington. She continued her education at the University of California at Los Angeles, receiving a M.S. in zoology in 1967. Afterwards, she taught high school students for a few years and later enrolled in the ecology program at Pennsylvania State University to earn a Ph.D. in 1974. Malcom returned to teaching for a year as assistant professor of biology at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and then moved to Washington, D.C., to work as a research associate at AAAS. Malcom was amazed at the lack of the minorities and women in her classes and faculty members while in college. Because of this experience, she decided to take action by becoming the program manager for the Minority Institutions Science Improvement Program at the National Science Foundation in 1977. The program provided federal funding to Historically Black Colleges and Universities for improved equipment and facilities as well as higher salaries for the faculty. In 1979, Malcom returned to AAAS as the head of the Office of Opportunities in Science.  Awards and honors  Dr. Malcom has received a variety of honors and awards, most notable was her election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the receipt of the 2003 Public Welfare Medal, the highest award presented by the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Malcom also holds 16 honorary degrees. On May 26, 2000 Dr. Malcom received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden.  Publications  While working as a research associate at AAAS, where she surveyed science education programs designed for minority students, a conference was held which Malcom helped to organize. The result of this conference was a landmark report, co-authored by Malcom, entitled The Double Bind: The Price of Being a Minority Woman in Science (1976). In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the importance of diverse learning environments, but dismissed formulaic and points-based approaches to undergraduate admissions to achieve this diversity. In response in 2004, AAAS issued a report titled Standing Our Ground: A Guidebook for STEM Educators in the Post-Michigan Era, written by Shirley Malcom, which clarifies legally plausible options for preserving diversity in engineering and science programs.

FPGA Due to the design components of field-programmable gate array into logic blocks, simple designs that underutilize a single block suffer from gate underutilization, as do designs that overflow onto multiple blocks, such as designs that use wide gates. Additionally, the very generic architecture of FPGAs lends to high inefficiency; multiplexers occupy silicon real estate for programmable selection, and an abundance of flip-flops to reduce setup and hold times, even if the design does not require them, resulting in 40 times less density than of standard cell ASICs.

Earlier historians had emphasized the power of Han Chinese to ‚Äúsinicize‚Äù their conquerors, that is, to assimilate and make them Chinese in their thought and institutions. In the 1980s and early 1990s, American scholars began to learn Manchu and took advantage of newly opened Chinese- and Manchu-language archives. This research found that the Manchu rulers were savvy in manipulating their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used Central Asian models of rule as much as they did Confucian ones. According to some scholars, at the height of their power, the Qing regarded \\"China\\" as only a part, although a very important part, of a much wider empire that extended into the Inner Asian territories of Mongolia, Tibet, the Northeast (today sometimes called Manchuria) and Xinjiang, or Chinese (Eastern) Turkestan. Some scholars (including the late Ping-ti Ho) have criticized the approach for exaggerating the Manchu character of the dynasty, and some in China accuse the American historians in the group of imposing American concerns with race and identity or even of imperialist misunderstanding to weaken China. Still others in China agree that this scholarship has opened new vistas for the study of Qing history. Xin Fan, \\"The anger of Ping-Ti Ho: the Chinese nationalism of a double exile.\\" Storia della storiografia 69.1 (2016): 147-160. The use of \\"New Qing History\\" as an approach is to be distinguished from the multi-volume history of the Qing dynasty that the Chinese State Council has been writing since 2003, which is also occasionally called \\"New Qing History\\" in English. In fact, this state project, a revision of the 1930s Draft History of Qing, is specifically written to refute the New Qing History.‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàÊñ∞Ê∏ÖÂè≤ÊòØ‰∏≠ÂÖ±ÁöÑÂõΩÂÆâÈóÆÈ¢ò Views Prominent scholars who have been associated with the New Qing History, including Evelyn Rawski, Mark Elliott, Pamela Kyle Crossley, Laura Hostetler, Philippe For√™t, and others, despite differing among themselves on important points, represent an \\"Inner Asian\\" and \\"Eurasian\\" turn, which conceived the Manchu-centered Qing as fundamentally different from most earlier dynasties but as similar to the Ottoman, Mogul, and Romanov Empires across the Eurasian landmass. They argued that the Qing saw itself as a universal empire, a multi- national polity, which with China as only the most central and economically important component. They date the founding of the empire from 1636, when the dynasty was proclaimed, rather than from 1644, when the Qing took control of Beijing. The historians argued that \\"Manchu\\" identity was deliberately created only after the takeover of China and that the new racial identity was important but \\"fungible,\\" easily exchanged for others. The first rulers of the dynasty played the Confucian role of Son of Heaven but at the same time, often behind the backs of their Han Chinese ministers, adopted other roles to rule other ethnic groups. The military expansion of frontiers, which Han Chinese ministers often opposed, as it drained resources from China proper, showed that the Qing empire was not only a victim of imperialism but also practiced imperialism itself. Some of the historians followed Evelyn Rawski calling the Qing \\"Early Modern,\\" rather than \\"late imperial,\\" on the grounds that the Manchus created a centralized empire that the Ming could not have created. Origins The origins of the New Qing History lie in Inner Asian Studies. A Harvard scholar, Joseph Fletcher, studied the languages and culture of Central Asia. He was among those to discredit the idea that nearly all Manchu documents were translations from Chinese and that they would add little to the record. He wrote in 1981, \\"Qing scholars who want to do first-class work in the archives must, from now on, learn Manchu and routinely compare the Manchu and Chinese sources for their topics of research.\\" Beatrice Bartlett, a Yale historian who had studied Manchu with Fletcher, reported in an article, 'Books of Revelations', that the archives in Taiwan and Beijing revealed many secrets, which required knowledge of Manchu. The Grand Council of the Yongzheng emperor operated only in Manchu until the 1730s, and many other important edicts and memorials did not have Chinese translations. Official use of the language, she argued, did not decline during the 19th century. She concluded that the archives of Manchu materials were more likely to be complete, as they were less likely to have been raided, weeded or lost.Both quoted in The New Qing History took on distinct form in the mid-1990s. In 1993, Crossley and Rawski summarized the arguments for using Manchu-language materials, materials, which they and others had explored in the newly opened archives in Beijing and were beginning to use in their publications. Evelyn Rawski's presidential address, \\"Re-envisioning the Qing: The Significance of the Qing Period in Chinese History,\\" at the annual meeting of the Association for Asian Studies in 1996, particularly criticized the question of the \\"sinicization\\" of the Qing that had been raised by Ping-ti Ho in his 1967 article \\"The Significance of the Ch'ing Period in Chinese History.\\" Rawski's thought was based on a Manchu-centric concept of history and indicated that the reason the Qing rulers could successfully govern China for nearly 300 years was not the result of sinicization, adopting the characteristics of Han Chinese rule and culture, but by their focus on retaining the characteristics of Manchu culture. They used such characteristics to strengthen relations with other nationalities to build a multiracial empire that included Manchu, Han, Mongol, Tibetan, Uyghur and other nationalities. For better governing his multiethnic empire, for instance, the Kangxi emperor located his summer residence in the Chengde Mountain Resort, north of the Great Wall. That became the historical core of city of Chengde, which the Qianlong emperor enlarged considerably, including a replica of the Potala Palace in Lhasa.For√™t (2000) In response, Ping-ti Ho published \\"In Defense of Sinicization: A Rebuttal of Evelyn Rawski's 'Re-envisioning the Qing'\\". He argued that the pattern of Chinese history was for a conquest dynasty to adopt Chinese ways of rule and culture and attacked Rawski for Manchu-centrism. The school that is now known as the \\"New Qing History\\" developed after the debate.Pamela Kyle Crossley, Beyond the culture: my comments on New Qing history In 2011, historian Huang Pei published a monograph that developed the objections stated by Ho Ping-ti. There are differences among the scholars in the loose group. For example, Rawski's Re-envisioning the Qing and Elliott‚Äôs The Manchu Way regard the Qing as a Manchu empire, with China being only one part. Nevertheless, Pamela Kyle Crossley sees the empire not as a Manchu empire but as a \\"simultaneous\\" system in which the rulership is not subordinate to the Chinese or any other single culture. She criticized the new \\"Manchu-centered\\" school for romanticism and a reliance upon disproved theories about \\"Altaic\\" language and history, but she seems to include herself in the Qing empire school, which she calls \\"Qing Studies.\\"\\"A Reserved View of the New Qing History\\" In 2015, historian Richard J. Smith reported that an interpretive \\"middle ground\\" had emerged between the views of Rawski and Crossley, on one hand, and Ho and Huang, on the other. Smith himself had come to the conclusion that \\"the Qing empire\\" and \\"China\\" were not the same thing and that the Qing had to be placed in not only a Manchu context but one that included Inner Asia in general and that saw China in a global field. The less \\"sinocentric\\" view, Smith continued, which placed less emphasis on \\"sinicization,\\" had won over most Western scholars on China, in spite of debates over \\"matters of degree.\\" Responses The arguments put forward in the New Qing History inspired debate on a number of specific points. =Dispute over term \\"China\\"= The scholar Zhao Gang responded against the revisionist historians by noting that they claimed that the Qing used only \\"China\\" (‰∏≠Âúã) to encompass only Han people (Êº¢‰∫∫) and \\"China proper\\" and pointed out that in fact that China proper and Han people were not synonymous with \\"China\\" in the Qing view according to Mark Elliott's own work.Zhao 2006, p. 4. The Han dynasty used Zhongguo (‰∏≠Âúã) to refer only to Han areas, but the Qing dynasty reinvented the definition of Zhongguo (‰∏≠Âúã) to refer to non-Han areas as well.Zhao 2006, p. 4. Zhao Gang cited Qing documents with Qing being used for the Manchu term Dulimbai Gurun (a direct translation of \\"‰∏≠Âúã\\", Zhongguo; \\"Middle Kingdom\\") in Manchu texts and Zhongguo in Chinese texts to refer to the entire Qing including Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet as \\"China\\", in official documents, edicts, treaties,Zhao 2006, pp. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14. in texts like the Treaty of Nerchinsk, Convention of Kyakhta (1768),Zhao 2006, p. 14. a 1755 pronouncement by the Qianlong Emperor,Zhao 2006, p. 4. and a Manchu language memorial on the conquest of Dzungaria,Zhao 2006, p. 12.Dunnell 2004, p. 77.Dunnell 2004, p. 83.Elliott 2001, p. 503. and Qianlong's arguments for the annexation of Xinjiang,Zhao 2006, pp. 11-12. and in Qianlong's sinicization policies in parts of Xinjiang.Zhao 2006, p. 18, 19, 25. Mark Elliott wrote that it was under the Qing that \\"China\\" transformed into a definition of referring to lands where the \\"state claimed sovereignty,\\" rather than only the Central Plains area and its people by the end of the 18th century.Elliot 2000, p. 638. Elena Barabantseva has also noted that the Manchu referred to all subjects of the Qing empire regardless of ethnicity as \\"Chinese\\" (‰∏≠Âúã‰πã‰∫∫), and they used the term Zhongguo (‰∏≠Âúã) as a synonym for the entire Qing empire but used \\"Hanren\\" (Êº¢‰∫∫) to refer only to the core area of the empire, with the entire empire viewed as multiethnic.Barabantseva 2010, p. 20. Joseph W. Esherick observes that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifan Yuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (‰∏≠Âúã) and made it \\"flexible\\" by using that term to refer to the entire empire.Esherick 2006, p. 232. =Other points= Scholars have disagreed on whether or how much the Manchu rulers used new forms of imperial ritual to display new forms of empire or continued rituals from the Ming to show that they saw themselves as heirs of a Han Chinese empire. Roger Des Forges' review of David M. Robinson's Martial Spectacles of the Ming Court criticized scholars of conquest dynasties and New Qing History and disagreed with the idea that the \\"Royal hunt\\" was a differing factor between Han Chinese and conquest dynasties. He noted that the martial themed Ming dynasty Grand Review was copied by the Qing and disagreed with those who sought to present it as a Qing feature. He praised Robinson in differing from scholars who selected certain Ming and Qing emperors to contrast their difference and for not conflating Han with \\"Chinese\\" and not translating the term \\"Zhongguo\\".Roger des Forges, (Review) Journal of Chinese Studies No. 60 ‚Äì (January 2015) pp. 302-303. The New Qing History, according to Tristan G. Brown, writing in 2011, did not explore the example of Islam and Muslims to test their argument that the early Qing emperors aspired to be universal monarchs. Brown finds that an inscription by the Qianlong emperor showed that he wanted to incorporate both Xinjiang and Islam into his empire and that this inscription, along with the \\"inventive structural duality of Chinese-Islamic architecture with Central Asian Turkish-Islamic architectural forms,\\" makes the \\"most compelling case\\" that New Qing History is also applicable to Chinese Islam. =In China= In the journal Chinese Social Sciences Today, an official publication of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Li Zhiting, a scholar working on the National Qing Dynasty Compilation Committee, charged that \\"'New Qing History' is academically absurd, and politically does damage to the unity of China....\\" He sought to \\"expose its mask of pseudo-academic scholarship, eliminating the deleterious effect it has had on scholarship in China.\\" Li went on to charge that the \\"whole range of views [New Qing History scholars] express are cliches and stereotypes, little more than dusted off versions in a scholarly tone of the Western imperialism and Japanese imperialism of the 19th century\\". American scholars such as Evelyn Rawski, Mark Elliott, Pamela Kyle Crossley, and James Millward, Li continued, \\"view the history of China from an imperialist standpoint, with imperialist points of view and imperialist eyes, regarding 'traditional' China as an 'empire,' regarding the Qing dynasty as 'Qing dynasty imperialism.'\\" quoted and translated in  Major works  * Pamela K.

Early life and education  Thomas W. Talley was born on October 9, 1870, in Shelbyville, Tennessee. He was one of eight children born to former slaves, Charles Washington and Lucinda Talley. Talley attended public school for six years, followed by high school and college at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he received an A.B. in 1890 and a master's degree in 1893. Starting in 1888 he participated in the Fisk music program, singing with the New Fisk Jubilee Singers and the Mozart Society, as well as the Fisk Union Church. He also conducted the Fisk choir for a number of seasons. Talley received a Doctor of Science degree from Walden University in 1899. After completing his doctorate, Talley went on to participate in post graduate programs at Harvard University in 1914 and 1916. He completed his dissertation at the University of Chicago years later in 1931, at the age of 61. The title of his dissertation is Theories relating to the constitution of the boron hydrides.  Interests  = Chemistry = Talley held teaching positions at several black colleges: Alcorn A&M; College in Lorman, Mississippi, in 1891; at Florida A&M; in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1893; and Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama, in 1900. From 1903 to 1942, Talley taught chemistry and biology at Fisk University. He also chaired the chemistry department at Fisk for 25 years. Talley-Brady Hall on Fisk's campus is named for Thomas Talley and St. Elmo Brady, another Fisk alumnus and chemist who was a student of Talley's. = Negro Folk Rhymes (Wise and Otherwise) = Talley began collecting rural black folk songs later in his life. Talley's first collection, published in 1922, Negro Folk Rhymes (Wise and Otherwise) contained 349 secular folksongs and spirituals. Already being well-known as the first such collection assembled by an African-American scholar, the book was seen at the time as a \\"masterpiece of the field\\". It was not only the first compilation of African-American secular folk songs, but also of folk songs of any kind from Tennessee. An edited edition of Negro Folk Rhymes\\\\\\" was re-released in 1991. Additional published works about music by Talley include The Origin of Negro Traditions and A Systematic Chronology of Creation. The publication of Negro Folk Rhymes marked a turning point in the study of African-American verse. Before its publication, little note had been taken of black secular traditions. Talley's book, along with a later collection by Howard Odum and Guy Johnson, called attention to these works.  Personal life  Talley married Ellen Eunice Roberts on August 28, 1899. The couple had two daughters.

The thriving period of Safed however ended in 1660, with Druze power struggles in the region and an economic decline. Since the early 20th century, some Kurdish Jews had been active in the Zionist movement.

In 1939, there were 4,369 in Jerusalem, growing to 30,000 in 1972. The vast majority of Kurdish Jews were forced out by Iraqi authorities, being evacuated to Israel in the early 1950s, together with other Iraqi Jewish community. The vast majority of the Kurdish Jews of Iranian Kurdistan relocated mostly to Israel as well, in the 1950s.

History  According to Mons Teigen, former executive vice president of the Montana Stockgrowers Association, in his essay ‚ÄúA Century of Striving to Organized Strength‚Äù published in the Centennial Issue of the Montana Stockgrower in 1984: ‚ÄúPrior to the 1880s, the young livestock industry on the great open ranges of Montana had little or no protection from the hazards of nature or man. Predators and diseases were attacking on one hand; rustlers and hungry Indians were taking their toll on the other.‚Äù In the 1880s, cattlemen began forming groups and holding meetings across the territory to address these issues. None really stuck until a group‚Äîreferred to by many different names, but most commonly known as the Eastern Montana Stockgrowers Association‚Äîwas formed in 1883. Another group, known as the Montana Stockgrowers Association, reorganized and held its first meeting in July 1884 in Helena. The groups eventually merged in 1885. In Miles City, on April 20, 1884, the Eastern Montana Stockgrowers Association met to discuss such issues as the overstocking of the range, Texas fever, and how to put a stop to the ‚Äúrustling‚Äù of livestock on the open range. Granville Stuart in his book Forty Years on the Frontier claims that 429 stockmen were present, although this is most likely a very generous estimate, as most other meetings were attended by fewer than 100. This meeting is looked back on as a turning point in the organization of cattlemen in the Montana Territory. Despite the other matters at hand, the topic of rustling soon overwhelmed the conversation and the group split into two sides; one side‚Äîincluding Theodore Roosevelt who ranched near the Montana border in Dakota, and the Marquis De Mores‚Äîfavoring an all-out war against the rustlers, the other side in favor of restraint. Granville Stuart led the faction that supported restraint, although in private conversation, he had supported more decisive action against the rustlers. Granville Stuart wrote of the meeting: ‚ÄúThe civil laws and courts had been tried and found wanting. The Montana cattlemen were as peaceable and law-abiding a body of men as could be found anywhere but they had $35,000,000 worth of property scattered over seventy-five thousand square miles of practically uninhabited country and it must be protected from thieves. The only way to do it was to make the penalty for stealing so severe that it would lose its attractions. When the subject was brought up some of the members were for raising a small army of cowboys and raiding the country: but the older and more conservative men knew that that would never do.‚Äù Stuart urged the group to consider that the rustlers were ‚Äústrongly fortified‚Äù in cabins that were like ‚Äúminiature fortresses.‚Äù He argued that the rustlers were well armed and stocked with ammunition, each of them ‚Äúa desperado and a dead shot.‚Äù He also said that if a confrontation were to occur, the law would come down on the side of the rustlers. He did not want any cattlemen to stand trial for murder. In the end, the group voted to take no action against the rustlers. T.A. Clay wrote in her article ‚ÄúA Call to Order: Law, Violence and the Development of Montana‚Äôs Early Stockmen‚Äôs Organizations‚Äù featured in the Autumn 2008 Issue of Montana The Magazine of Western History: ‚ÄúStuart‚Äôs opposition to a strike, however, was apparently a cover‚Äîan effort to rein in the group‚Äôs hotheads before they staked out a public position that would have ignited popular criticism. By calling for inaction, Stuart ensured that the cattlemen were on the record as being against harsh retribution. His position also gained the advantage of a surprise attack.‚Äù Word got back to the rustlers that the Stockgrowers would not be taking any action and they became more brazen in their thefts, even stealing a prized stallion and other horses from Stuart‚Äôs own DHS Ranch. Just a few weeks after the tumultuous meeting in Miles City, Stuart held a meeting at his ranch where he directed the operations of a group of reliable and tight-lipped men, later known as ‚ÄúStuart‚Äôs Stranglers.‚Äù They gathered intelligence on the rustlers and prepared to strike. Stuart‚Äôs Stranglers tracked down and killed at least thirty rustlers. Legitimate and highly respected cattlemen, like Granville Stuart, were forced to band together to take action against rustlers since no laws were yet on the books to protect their interests. But they also pursued the enactment of such laws, which was one of the major reasons for the existence of the Stockgrower groups, both in Helena and in Miles City. In 1884, both groups campaigned extensively for stockmen candidates for the Territorial Legislature of 1885, which resulted in what is known as the ‚ÄúCowboy Legislature.‚Äù The Executive Committee of the Helena-based Stockgrowers group was in session during the entire Cowboy Legislature led by Granville Stuart, who became president of the association during the July 28, 1884 meeting (just shortly after his escapades to combat rustling). Bills that were passed during the Cowboy Legislature of 1885 included laws to prevent losses of livestock from theft and diseases. One law authorized the Governor to appoint a Territorial Veterinarian Surgeon to deal with disease in livestock. Another law was passed authorizing the governor to appoint six Livestock Commissioners in each of Dawson, Custer, Yellowstone, Meagher, Chouteau and Lewis and Clark Counties to appoint and employ inspectors and detectives to protect the livestock interests of the Territory from rustlers. Another law prohibited the branding of cattle on the public ranges during certain months. Also, a law was passed detailing the legal process for rounding up strays on public ranges. It has a Board of Livestock which oversees the Department of Livestock, including its Brands Enforcement Division that protects ranchers from the theft of livestock through its brand laws and inspections. The association has continued to work through state and national legislative and regulatory channels to achieve the goals and needs of its members in regards to issues such as cattle theft, cattle diseases, federal lands grazing, predators and endangered species, international trade, and taxes.  Local Organizations  Montana Stockgrowers is affiliated with 24 local Stockgrower groups throughout Montana. Affiliation with the state organization allows local groups to bring forward resolutions that guide MSGA policies and allows Montana Stockgrowers to represent the interests of ranchers from across the state.

Jewish communities, who now reside within the state of Israel. They number around 450,000.HighBeam History Since the destruction of the First Temple there was a connection between Babylonian exiles and the Land of Israel. According to the Al-Yahudu Tablets, a collection of tablets from the sixth century BCE, multiple Jews were given names reflecting their families desire to return to Zion. =Zionism during the Ottoman Empire= By the end of the 19th century, political Zionism entered the consciousness of the Jews of Iraq and Zionist activity began. In 1914, the first Zionist organisation was founded by Menashe Hakim, Maurice Fattal and Raphael Horesh under the name \\"Zionist Association of Baghdad\\", to promote the Zionist cause in Mesopotamia. The short-lived organisation collapsed in November of that year when the Ottoman Empire declared war on Britain. =Zionism during the British Mandate= In the 1920s, after Britain conquered Iraq from the Ottoman Empire, transportation between Iraq and Palestine became much more common. Although at this point Iraqi Zionists were mostly unorganized, they were well funded by a few wealthy philanthropists. In 1920, the first major Zionist organization was founded under the name \\"Jewish Literacy Society.\\" It published a Hebrew and Judeo- Arabic journal called Yeshurun. On March 5th, 1921, a branch of the Jewish Literary Society founded a separate Zionist association known as \\"The Mesopotamian Zionist Society.\\" A revived \\"Zionist Association of Baghdad\\" would later merge with this Society in 1924. Zionist activists in Baghdad, 1922 In contrast to the elite class of Iraqi Jews who remained unattracted to Zionism, it received considerable support from poorer Jewish citizens who demonstrated their support in multiple public gatherings. These demonstrations led to condemnations by British officials and Arab authorities who warned against public activities. Until 1929, there was no official ban against their activities and Zionist organizations continued to exist discreetly. In 1923, a branch of Keren Hayesod was established in Baghdad. Reuben Battat, an Iraqi- Jewish judge, handed a decision down in favor of allowing a property transfer from Jewish philanthropist Gourji Shemtov to the Keren Hayesod in 1923. This decision was used against him 26 years later, when he was sentenced to three years in prison on charges of being a Zionist. Alfred Mond's 1928 visit to Baghdad led to the first anti-Zionist demonstration in the city. Multiple Jews were injured in attacks related to the protests. There were other short lived Zionist organizations such as \\"Agudat Ahi'ever\\" (1929), \\"Histadrut ha-No-ar ha-Ivri\\" (1929), and \\"Maccabi\\" (1929‚Äì1930). Palestinian Jewish teachers were brought in to teach Hebrew and Jewish history. Some AIU schools in Baghdad during this time organized Hebrew literary societies which promoted Zionism. After the 1929 riots, the Iraqi government began a campaign against Zionism. Palestinian Jewish teachers were expelled, and Iraqi Zionist leaders were arrested. =The Farhud pogrom of 1941= Group of young Iraqi Jews who fled to Mandatory Palestine following the Farhud During the 1930s, Nazi influence was widespread in Baghdad, due to presence by the German legation as well as Arabic broadcasts from Berlin. Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf was translated into Arabic by Yunis al-Sabawi and published in local Baghdadi newspapers. Following a military coup in 1941, a pro-Nazi government gained power in Iraq. One day after an armistice between Iraq and Britain, began a two-day pogrom. Days before the pogrom broke out, members of the Al-Muthanna Club went around marking Jewish homes with red paint. The massacre began on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, and throughout the rampage hundreds of Jews were murdered, thousands were wounded, while thousands of Jewish shops and synagogues were plundered. It was estimated by Iraqi-Jewish leaders that around 2,500 families, which accounts for 15% of Baghdadi Jews, suffered directly as a result of the pogrom. Some of the leaders behind the Farhud pogrom blamed Jews for British imperialism in Iraq while others perceived Baghdadi Jews as Zionists or Zionist sympathizers. The effect the Farhud had on the Iraqi Jewish community was tremendous. It added a sense of anxiety among Baghdadi Jews which heavily influenced their relationship with Iraq. It shed a light on the plight of Jews in Arab countries, leading to Iraqi Jews being included in Zionist plans for immigration to establish a Jewish state. =Exodus of Iraqi Jews (1949‚Äì1952)= Following the 1947 Partition Plan for Palestine and Israeli independence in 1948, a wave of anti-Semitism hit Iraq. All Jews working in the government were removed from their positions, hundreds were arrested on dubious charges of being Zionists or Communists. On October 23rd, 1948, wealthy Jewish businessman Shafiq Ades, who was an outspoken Anti- Zionist, was publicly hung in Basra after being accused of selling weapons to Israel and the Iraqi Communist Party. No evidence was provided during the three-day trial showing Ades sold weapons to Israel and the judge presiding over the case was a member of a pro-Nazi party. The general sentiment among Iraqi Jews following his killing was that if Ades could be executed by the state, any Jew could. After the establishment of Israel in 1948, Iraq forbade Jews from emigrating to Israel. Even with the restrictions, the Iraqi Zionist underground was smuggling around 1,000 Jews every month to Israel via Iran. On May 19th, 1950, 150 Jews were airlifted out of Iraq. At first it was called \\"Operation Ali Baba,\\" however it became known by Operation Ezra and Nehemiah, for the prophets who led Babylonian Jews out of exile to the Land of Israel. Within days of the first operation, over 30,000 Iraqi Jews registered to leave which meant they had to leave within 15 days. The ones who weren't able to leave within 15 days were considered stateless refugees, and many lived homeless in the streets of Baghdad. In response, the Iraqi government announced that it was prepared to move them to concentration camps if they were not removed swiftly. From 1950‚Äì1952 between 120,000 and 130,000 Jews were airlifted out of Iraq to Israel. Once the operation was over, only 6,000 Jews remained in Iraq.

Toys were a brand of diecast toy cars and trucks manufactured and distributed by Underwood Engineering Co. Ltd. of Inglewood, New Zealand. Production was started by Jack Underwood about 1935 and continued until 1982. Since this time reproductions have been made also in Inglewood (Taranaki) at the Fun Ho! Toys Museum (Fun Ho! 2015). Currently toys are occasionally cast as museum memorabilia using original molding plates and boxes. The name was always portrayed with the exclamation following Fun Ho! Early years The earliest Fun Ho! race cars made in the late 1930s were mostly generic midget, sprint, and salt flat cars of simple casting with two axles, and four rubber wheels (sometimes the rubber was white). The first cars were made out of lead (Jordan 2015). Most of the cars had a driver that was part of the casting. Only a couple, like the Cooper and Mercedes Streamliner were replicas of real cars (Fun Ho! 2015). Early diecast Fun Ho! cars were a Ford Model A, a 1949 Ford, a Packard Roadster, an Austin Healey 100, a Studebaker saloon, a Humber Hawk, an MG TD roadster, a Jaguar XK 120 convertible and coupe, the above- mentioned Mercedes Streamliner and an interesting early 1950s 'High Boy' hot rod that looks suspiciously like the design that Auburn Rubber toys used in their inventory. A caravan house trailer was also available. A Morestone-like motorcycle with sidecar and single motorcycle with rider were also offered. A couple of tractors were also offered and more were added into the 1950s. Again, some were generic while newer models were a Fordson, a Massey Harris, a couple of Fergusons, and a swept fender Oliver. A few farm implements, like a disc harrow, plow, and trailers were made. A number of fire engines were also offered, along with a number of trucks, buses and construction vehicles. There were also a couple of fighter aircraft and a train with several cars. Most vehicles were of a small 'Matchbox' or 'Tootsietoy' size, but a few were larger 'Tonka' like dump trucks, tractors and other construction vehicles. Typical of an early diecasting firm, also made were sundry diecast buildings, road signs, doll house furniture pieces and yard working shovels, pitchforks, rakes and other implements. Some of the larger toys and doll house accessories were apparently tooling from Tri-Ang of England as the Tri-Ang name appears with the clown and Fun Ho! logo on some toys (Fun Ho! 2015). One interesting aspect in the casting of Fun Ho! toys is that when a changeover from lead was made, the logical industry choice of zamac or similar zinc alloy was passed up and most Fun Ho! toys are made of aluminum. Matchbox and Budgie tooling? The Fun Ho! Midget Scale Model series was introduced in the mid 1960s with other models introduced later by Underwood into the 1970s (Jordan 2015). Though through the years, Fun Ho! made over 250 different models, there were at least 60 models in the Midget series. The new line was based on the acquisition of the tooling for nine existing models that were made in Melbourne, Australia, in the late 1950s by Streamlux. Streamlux sold the tooling to Fun Ho! in 1962 (Daw 2014). These models included a tractor, Holden FE sedan, VW bug, BOAC double deck bus, VW Transporter, Austin tipper truck and tanker, and a simply cast Mercedes Streamliner, These models formed the backbone of Fun Ho!'s Midget Scale Model Series (Daw 2014). Later, Fun Ho! introduced several new models. At first glance these appear to be dies from both English Lesney and Budgie Toys, but not-so-close inspection shows the Midget Models to be much more crude and, in many cases, smaller, than the original models from those companies. At least 15 models seem similar enough to former Matchbox (brand) models to eliminate the possibility of coincidence. Some of these are: the 1964 Chevrolet Impala (n√©e 'taxi' as a Matchbox), Dodge wreck truck, Jaguar XKE, Jaguar Mk. 10, Ford Zephyr, Morris pickup truck, Scammell dump truck (sans plow), Merryweather Marquis fire engine, and the bulldozer and excavator (Midget Scale no date; Ragan 2000, 77). Cars were very simply cast, and rather austere. They had neither windows nor interiors, whether plastic or metal (see examples at Fun Ho! webpage No date). The only exceptions were on a couple of models like the MGB where metal seats protruded into the interior, but only as part of the casting of the chassis. Several other trucks and buses were also seen and may have been Budgies in spirit if not in actual tooling. A Hillman Imp and several articulated trucks are very similar to previous British Budgie offerings. The origin of the tooling of a few Holden models and other Utes is uncertain, as was the inclusion of the MGB which is not seen elsewhere in 'Matchbox' size (Ragan 2000, 56). Two different car trailers and a farm trailer were offered (Ragan 2000, 41, 81). Several of the Midget series including the Road Roller, two different Excavators, and Road Grader were offered in dark green military colors along with a Jeep, Half-track and trailer. Other models were sold in Fire Service gift sets and painted all in red. For a time, some Midget models were used as promotional models for Mobil Gas, and recognizable by their red and white boxes. These were packaged similar to regular Midgets but called \\"Mobil Midget Models\\" and displaying a Mobil gas pump on boxes and instruction sheet (Fun Ho! webpage No date.) Some dies later arrived in Australia and were produced under the name Message Models. These were apparently the Jaguar Mk 10, Ford Thames Ute, Holden HR Ute, Holden HR sedan, and Chevrolet Bel Air (Johnson 1998, 80). Marketing and packaging The logo for the company showed Fun Ho! in a script like form within an oval that included an odd portrait of a clown-like face that looks kind of like a laughing child with a beanie cap...or...a yelling oriental martial arts specialist. The riddle is solved when looking at a company catalog (leaflet) that zooms out showing a clown complete with ruffles and a tall pointed hat and carrying a Fun Ho! sign (Jordan 2015). The clown was most often printed in red, and was even used for company Christmas cards once upon a time (Jordan 2015). The logo was probably OK from the 1930s through the 1960s, but as an advertising gimmick, the design would probably would not work well with children today. Some of the early cars and trucks were offered in plastic bags stapled to attached red cardboard pegboard- punched hangers marked with the Fun Ho! logo. Midget Toy boxes were very similar to earlier British Budgie Toys with red and yellow alternate colors on sides ‚Äì and also in that the Midget Toys logo was portrayed in 'portrait' style with box stood on end. The box ends were red and had a line drawing illustration of the vehicle inside with model number. Boxes said \\"New Zealand made\\" on the sides. Some later boxes had plastic windows (Fun Ho! webpage No date). The Mobil Gas Midget Series boxes were decorated similar to the yellow and red ones ‚Äì but these were colored red and white. Cessation and the Museum Factory Into the early 1970s, Fun Ho! produced up to one million vehicles a year. By the late 1970s, however, import substitution practices supporting national production changed and more toys were imported from abroad (Jordan 2015). These American Hot Wheels, English Matchbox Toys, and Japanese Tomicas, among other brands had windows, plastic interiors, opening features and various figures or animals which accompanied the models. The writing was on the wall, the pressures of competition increased, and Fun Ho! toy production ceased in 1982. The factory officially closed in 1987 (Jordan 2015). Sometime after the closing of the factory, The Fun Ho! Toys Museum opened in Inglewood. The museum acquired much of the original Underwood tooling and currently (sporadically) Richard Jordan makes about 100 different Fun Ho! models there in the function of museum support. The toy making part of the museum goes by the name of the Fun Ho! National Toy Museum Foundry. References * Daw, David. 2014. Streamlux page. Toyzine.com website. * Fun Ho! webpage.

It contains one of the many traditional versions of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which differs most significantly from similar papyri in the style of the central scene of the Judgement of the dead. The papyrus was part of the collection of August Kestner and is now located in the Museum August Kestner in Hanover (inventory number 3454), where it is displayed in Room II of the Egyptological collection with other gravegoods and artefacts from the death cult. The book derives from Thebes and is dated to the Ptolemaic period, probably around 200 BC. The papyrus was among the grave goods of the Singer of Amun, Nehem-es- Rataui. The Papyrus was written in Hieratic script, completely in black ink. Originally the 21 centimetre high document had a length of 715 centimetres - that is, 15 pages. As a result of damage in the Second World War, when the central city of Hanover was bombed and the Kestner Museum took heavy damage, it only survives in the form of three fragments with a length of 1.64 m, which includes the central scene. The very tight combination of the important Egyptian deities in the central scene is notable. Osiris sits in judgement, Anubis and Horus weigh the heart of the deceased, Thoth records the result and the monstrous Ammit waits to devour the ba of the deceased in the event of a negative judgement. On a lotus bloom between Osiris and Thoth stand the four sons of Horus. The deceased is at the right, accompanied by two goddesses. At other points, the text is broken up by small images, mostly of the Horus falcon. Another large image is located to the left of the main image, divided into four smaller images.

It has been called a holistic approach because some believe it includes more elements into the design process. It consists of 9 elements: # Identify instructional problems, and specify goals for designing an instructional program. # Examine learner characteristics that should receive attention during planning. # Identify subject content, and analyze task components related to stated goals and purposes. # State instructional objectives for the learner. # Sequence content within each instructional unit for logical learning. # Design instructional strategies so that each learner can master the objectives. # Plan the instructional message and delivery. # Develop evaluation instruments to assess objectives. # Select resources to support instruction and learning activities. Kemp‚Äôs cognitive learning design model is learner-centered, thus its oval shape, and the steps are interdependent; the steps do not have to be followed in any particular order to complete the instructional learning systems design. This signifies a systems approach in which the instructional design process is a continuous cycle, while maintaining the importance on how to manage the instructional design process. The characteristics of the model * All elements are interdependent * All the elements can be performed simultaneously as the model is nonlinear and flexible * The user can start at any point in the process * Learning needs, goals, priorities and constraints determine the instructional solutions. * All programs or projects may not require all nine elements.

Lockhart. The novel has received critical acclaim and won the Goodreads Choice Award for Best Young Adult Fiction. It was also listed as an ALA Top Ten Best Fiction for Young Adults for 2015. We Were Liars focuses on the theme of self-acceptance, family morals, and the possibly-deadly consequences of one's mistakes. It is centered on the wealthy, seemingly perfect Sinclair family, who spend every summer gathered on their private island. However, not every summer is the same‚Äîwhen something happens to Cadence during the summer of her fifteenth year, the four \\"Liars\\" (Cadence, Johnny, Gat and Mirren) re-emerge two years later to prompt Cadence to remember the incident.  Plot  Cadence Sinclair Eastman is the eldest grandchild of the wealthy Harris Sinclair. Although her family pretends to be perfect, Cadence knows that beneath the surface, wealth and privilege have taken an insidious toll on her family and that any unhappiness or odd behavior is ignored or repressed to perpetuate the image of refinement. Harris has three daughters, Cadence's mother Penny, and her aunts Carrie and Bess. Harris owns an island called Beechwood Island near Martha's Vineyard and has built a home for himself, Clairmont, along with a house for each of his daughters and their families. The Sinclairs spend their summers on the island. Cadence and the other older cousins, Mirren, Johnny, along with Gat Patil (who is not a cousin, but is the nephew of Cadence's aunt Carrie's partner Ed) are known by the family as \\"The Liars\\". The summer Cadence is fifteen, which she refers to as Summer Fifteen, Gat and Cadence fall in love and begin a relationship. During Summer Fifteen Cadence suffers a serious head injury recalling only that she struck her head in the water. She loses most of her memories of that summer and begins to suffer from migraines. She also becomes addicted to Percocet and is forced to repeat a year at school. When she tries to reach out to her cousins she is ignored. Rather than allowing her to go to the island for the summer, Cadence's mother forces her to go on a tour of Europe with her father, whom Cadence is no longer close to after he had an affair and abandoned the family. Summer Seventeen. Cadence is allowed to go back to the island and is surprised to find much has changed. Her controlling grandfather now suffers from bouts of dementia. His estate, Clairmont, has been replaced by New Clairmont, a cold architectural monstrosity that has none of the charms of the previous Clairmont. The Liars also act strange around Cadence and refuse to talk about what happened Summer Fifteen. They also reject the idea of spending time at New Clairmont and instead camp out together at Cuddledown, which was formerly the estate of Bess and her family. On Beechwood Cadence begins to slowly remember events from the Summer Fifteen. She recalls that it was after her grandmother, Tipper had died that her mother and aunts began to bicker over their inheritances involving their children in their disputes. Though each woman had been given access to trust funds and education none of them were able to earn a living independently and continued to depend on their controlling father to ensure their financial futures. Gat also informs her that Carrie has refused to marry his uncle despite living together for nine years since Harris is opposed to her marrying a man of Indian descent and for this reason is also opposed to Gat and Cadence's relationship. Cadence finally remembers that Summer Fifteen she proposed that she and the rest of the Liars should burn down Clairmont in order to get the family to stop feuding over the property. She is delighted with the idea that she was able to keep the family together until she recalls that the Liars forgot to release her grandfather's dogs, killing them. When she goes to Gat for comfort he asks her if she was able to recall anything else. Cadence realizes that Johnny, Mirren, and Gat all died in the fire. She goes to visit the Liars at Cuddledown where they tell her that their deaths were not her fault and reveal that they will no longer be able to appear to her, diving into the ocean and disappearing. After several days of private grieving Cadence rejoins her family and decides to build her life anew.

Lockhart wrote We Were Liars with knowledge of the ending. She was particularly inspired by the twist endings in Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, because the first twist still kept the reader interested, as well as Rebecca Stead's When You Reach Me which contained a lot of small details that fell into place at the end. The novel is written in five acts, though pieces of each were rearranged, particularly the middle three. Lockhart wrote the novel on the writing software Scrivener which made it easy to rearrange segments of text. She changed the structure of the ending shortly before the advance reader copy, based on suggestions from young adult author John Green. As a child, Lockhart was \\"captivated\\" by fairy tale collections her mother had and incorporated a fairy tale feel to We Were Liars; she stated, \\"Fairy tales have been a preoccupation of mine for a very long time, and for a long time I wanted to write a contemporary story with a fairy-tale structure so I could unpack some of what I had spent so much time thinking about.\\" The relationship between the Liars was inspired by Lockhart's \\"fantasy\\" of having close friends growing up, but also an attempt to \\"unpack\\" potential consequences of the bond. The character of Gat, who is part of the Liars but also an outsider to the family, was drawn from Lockhart's experience as a scholarship student at private schools, as well as Emily Bront√´'s novel Wuthering Heights. Lockhart also stated that some individuals close to her experience migraines and she was interested in exploring how pain affects one's personality and perception of the world. The publisher hoped that the novel would have a large crossover appeal to adult readers because it had \\"teens who must interact with imperfect adults and imperfect adults who are important to the entire dynamic of the plot.\\" To promote We Were Liars without giving too much of the plot away, a blog on Tumblr was created, focusing on the aesthetic of the Sinclair's island with quotes from the book. The promotional material urged readers to \\"just lie\\" if they were asked about the ending. Themes Los Angeles Times writer Amy Benfer described that thematically, We Were Liars was \\"a classic story of decaying aristocracy and the way that privilege can often hamstring more than help.\\" Release and reception We Were Liars debuted at #6 on the New York Times Bestseller List in the young adult category. From June 1 to September 7, it spent 13 weeks on the top ten. Goodreads determined that it was the most-searched standalone title of 2014 on the website, leading them to declare it a possibility for the year's \\"it\\" book. Bustle affirmed this declaration, believing that the novel was \\"compulsively readable,\\" had a \\"meaningful\\" plot, and was frequently talked about. We Were Liars received mostly positive reviews from critics. Kirkus Reviews awarded We Were Liars a starred review, stating that it was \\"riveting, brutal and beautifully told.\\" The review particularly praised Lockhart's humanizing of the Sinclairs. Publishers Weekly also wrote a starred review, referring to Lockhart's depiction of the family as \\"astute.\\" School Library Journal reviewer Karyn Silverman said that Cadence's voice was the highlight of the novel, but also praised the \\"smart\\" writing in regards to plotting and complex characters. The publication also listed it among their \\"Best Books of 2014.\\" Katrina Hedeen of The Horn Book Magazine also gave a starred review, describing it as an \\"intriguing, atmospheric story\\" with a \\"taut psychological mystery\\" and unexpected twist. The Wall Street Journal also gave a positive review, noting the crossover appeal to adults and praising Cadence as an unreliable narrator. Josh Lacey of The Guardian described the novel as \\"cunning\\" and \\"clever\\", calling the twist ending \\"nastier and more shocking than anything I had imagined.\\" The Daily Telegraph's Martin Chilton gave the book four out of five stars, calling it \\"a mysterious and addictive treat\\" with a twist that is \\"dramatic and severe.\\" Meg Rosoff, writing for The New York Times, felt that the execution \\"fell oddly flat\\"; she enjoyed the \\"snappy characterizations\\" of the privileged family, but felt that overall the novel was not able to fully delve into the personalities of the characters. In regards to the ending, however, she wrote that \\"Lockhart just about manages to pull it off, thanks to the freshness of the writing and the razor-sharp metaphor amnesia provides for the Sinclair family habit of denial.\\" We Were Liars was listed among the best young adult books of 2014 by Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, School Library Journal, and The Wall Street Journal. It also made the list of ALA Top Ten Best Fiction for Young Adults for 2015, and was the only young adult novel listed in Amazon's Best 20 Books of the Year. It was also a finalist in the book of the year category for the Teen Choice Book Awards, and won the Goodreads Choice Award for Young Adult Fiction.

History Before the Establishment of the State of Israel, rising French influence in Morocco at the beginning of the 20th century encouraged Moroccan Jews to enroll in French schools, receive a French education and integrate into French culture until 1940, when the Vichy laws came into effect and forbade Jewish attendance in French schools. After the Second World War and the establishment of the state of Israel, Jewish Zionist organizations encouraged many Jewish families to leave Morocco and they migrated to Israel legally, with the approval of the French rule at the time. Following the war, many young Moroccan Jews migrated to Israel in a bold move and joined \\"Gahal\\" forces that were fighting the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Towards the end of the Turkish Ottoman Empire rule and prior to the signing of the Fez Treaty, which entailed French protection of Moroccan Jews, there was a mass escape of Jews from large cities such as Fez, Meknes, Rabat and Marrakech to the smaller towns and villages surrounding the cities. The overcrowding, the decline in financial circumstances and the need to pray in secret caused some young families to emigrate to Israel or move to Tunisia; which employed a more liberal policy for Jews. Rumors and letters which started arriving at synagogues told of Jews migrating to and settling in Israel, encouraging the Maghreb Jews. The first community to make the move were Fez Jews were living near the synagogue (the main synagogue) in Fez. About 60 to 80 young families migrated from 1908 to 1918, and settled mainly in Jerusalem and Tiberias. Amongst the first families to settle in Jerusalem were; Ohana, and Zana, Mimeran Turgeman, and Aifraga. The Aifragan brothers, who were bankers back in Fez, could not adapt to life in Israel; they bid their cousins, the Zane family, goodbye in 1918, and moved to France and subsequently to Canada. The David, Zane and Turgeman families lived in the Jewish Quarter whilst the rest of the families lived in Mishkanot (English: \\"residence\\") and Sukkot Shalom (English: \\"peace tent\\"). Migration was carried out largely through Tunisia, using small boats to travel from there to Israel. In the summer of 1911, a baby boy; Moshe Vezana, was born, a son to Simcha (Pircha) and David, aboard the ship on their way to Israel. Upon their arrival at Yafo port, the baby's Brit Milah was celebrated. The boy, who was a son to a 'Mugrabi' family, was recorded at times as a Tunisian native and, at other times, as an Israeli native. All other eight brothers were born in the Old City of Jerusalem. It was a large family of Mughrabi; the largest living inside the walls of the Old City, until their escape to Katamon due to War of Independence. The Maghreb Jewish community was small between the first and third migrations. Leading congregations in Jerusalem were primarily communities which had immigrated from Iraq, Iran, Bukhara and Yemen. After the Israeli war of independence in 1948, and due to domestic strife in the 1950s, the next several decades saw waves of Moroccan Jewish emigration to Israel. Moroccan Jews emigrated for a variety of reasons. Some have emigrated to Israel for religious reasons, some feared persecution, and others left for better economic prospects than they faced in post-colonial Morocco. With every Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war, tensions between Muslim Arabs and Jews rose, sparking more Moroccan Jewish emigration. By the time of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, the majority of Morocco's Jewish population had emigrated to Israel.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4350488,00.html Morocco once represented the largest Jewish community in the Muslim world. However beginning around the time of the establishment of the modern state of Israel, through the mid-1960s, almost 90% of Moroccan Jews made Aliyah and emigrated to Israel. Jewish emigration from Morocco was uncommon before 1945. This was partially due to a lack of stressors to leave. Jews in Morocco felt like they had political security and favorable economic opportunity. They did not want to move to British-controlled Israel-Palestine where the political landscape and economic conditions were more unstable. The British restricted Jewish immigration making the process difficult and providing further disincentive. Additionally, French Moroccan authorities worked to neutralize Zionist efforts when interest in Zionism was proliferating throughout Europe. In 1947‚Äì1948, interest in making Aliyah became clear in large segments of Moroccan Jewry. One reason for this was dissatisfaction with the French government's treatment of Moroccan Jews. Specifically, there was a refusal to consider granting educated Jews French citizenship which led to a desire for more freedom and better representation in government. Additionally, many places where the current system, which included the AIU, failed had produced regions of mass poverty. Along with this, there was an emotional drive fueled by Zionism gaining popularity among Moroccan Jews. This was a result of greater clarity into the viability of a Jewish state in Palestine. During this early period of immigration, much of it was facilitated illegally by Mossad LeAliyah Bet and Jewish Agency emissaries. Moroccan Jews were smuggled into Morocco through the border at Oujda. From there, they were brought to transit camps. Only three ships were able to leave. The first two were held in Cyprus until Israeli independence and the last left with only 44 emigrants due to the activity being discovered by French Moroccan authorities. This resulted in the shutdown of this entire illegal emigration operation. A consequence of these activities was an increase in antisemitism in Morocco. A notable incident was a pogrom in Oudjda and the surrounding area. On June 7, 1948 43 Jews were killed by local Muslims whose frustration was enhanced by French Moroccan officials. =Emigration under Hassan II of Morocco= Policy changed with the accession of Hassan II of Morocco in 1961. Hassan agreed to accept a large per-capita bounty from the international Jewish community for each Jew who emigrated from Morocco, and under this agreement Jews were allowed the freedom to emigrate. Between the years 1961‚Äì1967, around 120,000 Jews left Morocco. The Six-Day War in 1967 led to another wave of emigration of Jews from Morocco, primarily to France, but also to Canada, the United States, Israel and other countries. Moroccan Jews in Israel enjoyed less upward mobility: 51 percent were blue- collar in 1961 and 54 percent as late as 1981.Eliezer Ben-Rafael and Stephen Sharot, Ethnicity, REligion, and Class in Israeli Society, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991, 67 =The disaster of the Egoz ship = In 1961 the ship Egoz (\\"nut\\"), which held 44 illegal immigrants, drowned in the sea on its way to Israel. After the sinking of Egoz, pressure was exerted on Morocco and a secret treaty was signed with King Hassan II and consequently a massive exodus of Jews from Casablanca port was carried out under the supervision of General Oufkir. Some Jews came to Israel and some migrated to France and other countries.

The black comedy centres on Jack Arnold Alexander Tancred Gurney, the 14th Earl of Gurney and the attempts to cure him of insanity. Plot Poster depicting the Lady of the Camellias, Lord Gurney's imagined wife. After a speech at a dinner proposing a toast to England, the 13th Earl of Gurney is got ready for bed by his butler Tucker. This includes setting up a silken noose above his four- poster, which the Earl uses for a bizarre autoerotic asphyxiation ritual. He survives this the first time, but it goes wrong the second time he tries it and kills him. His half-brother Sir Charles, Charles' wife Lady Claire and their son Dinsdale gather to hear the reading of the 13th Earl's will. Three of the Earl's sons have already died overseas in the British Empire and the one survivor, Jack, is in a mental institution and thought to be unable to be present. He has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic prone to delusions of grandeur, caused or worsened by his time at boarding school, where he felt abandoned and victimized. As a subconscious defence against such abandonment, he developed a delusion that he was Jesus Christ returned to bring and embody love, so that people would have to love him in order to find peace and salvation. The reading goes ahead - besides ¬£30,000 left to Tucker and other bequests to eccentric charities, the relations are shocked to hear that the 13th Earl has left his title and estates not to Charles but to Jack, making him the 14th Earl. Jack arrives and asks for a moment of prayer, which actually turns into a conversation with himself, still thinking he is Jesus and God. Charles finds a loophole, that Jack can be sent back to the insane asylum so soon as he has married and begotten a sane heir to succeed him. However, Jack states he is already married, to La Dame aux Cam√©lias, who he insists is a real person not a fictional character. Charles has his long-time mistress Grace Shelly arrive in disguise as 'La Dame' and Jack agrees to her request for a 'second' wedding. This goes ahead, but Grace falls in love with Jack and becomes his ally. She also conceives a child by him, despite him spending their wedding night on a unicycle. Lady Claire also proves obstructive and begins an affair with Jack's psychiatrist Herder to try to persuade him to cure Gurney more quickly. Herder attempts to achieve this through intensive psychotherapy then - when this fails - resorts to shock therapy on the night that Grace goes into labour. This consists of bringing in another patient who also believed himself to be Christ, or, as the patient put it, \\"the God of electricity\\". Rather than drawing Jack to the conclusion that they cannot both be Christ, it causes him an apparent breakdown and he seemingly returns to his true identity as Jack Gurney. Sir Charles, still intent on stealing the lordship, sends for a court psychiatrist to evaluate Gurney, confident that his nephew would be sent to an asylum for life. However, Jack puts up a front and plays on the psychiatrist being a fellow Etonian, getting himself declared sane. Jack also reveals to the audience that he has not been cured but instead switched to believing he is both the Old Testament God of vengeance and Jack the Ripper. Now a violent psychopath with a puritanical hatred of women, Gurney murders Sir Charles' wife in a fit of enraged revulsion when she tries to seduce him and frames Tucker (still working for the family) for the crime. Jack then assumes his place in the House of Lords with a fiery speech in favour of capital and corporal punishment. That night, Grace admits her love for him and he murders her for it.

That medieval church was torn down in 1620 and replaced with the present church in 1621. It has been renovated several times since it was built, most recently in 1951. The present church became too small for the congregation and so in 1960, a new, modern B√∏mlo Church was built about to the southwest, closer to the main village centre of Langev√•g.

Participants go through different phases like immersion, ideation, design, and prototyping (hacking), leading to a demonstrable proof of concept.

It is located in the village of Mosterhamn on the island of Moster. It used to be the main church for the Moster parish which is part of the Sunnhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, stone church was built in a long church style in the 12th century using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 80 people. History The Old Moster Church has a long and important history in Norway. According to tradition and the historian Snorri Sturluson, Norwegian King Olav Tryggvason built a church at Mosterhamn in the year 998 when Christianity first introduced to Norway. Around the year 1024, the King Olaf II of Norway (later Saint Olaf) held a thing at Moster where the oldest Christian law was introduced in Norway, converting the kingdom to Christianity. The current stone church was probably built around the year 1150 on the site of the original wooden church. The church is protected and owned by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. The old church only seats about 80 people, so in the mid-19th century, the church had become too small for the congregation, so a new Moster Church was built nearby in 1874. This church was then turned into a museum. It was restored by Peter Andreas Blix in 1896 to look like it historically did. The church is no longer used by the parish for regular worship, but it is still consecrated for use and so it is used for special occasions. Design The church has a square choir and a rectangular nave and with an entrance in the western wall of the nave and one in the southern wall of the choir. The roof structures were replaced in the 18th century. The church is mainly built of soapstone from a quarry near the village of Lykling.

It is also known as \\"(Lord) I Don't Care Where Dey (They, You) Bury My Body\\" and \\"My Soul Is Gonna Live with God\\". The origins of the song are obscure. The earliest recording may be by the Norfolk Jazz and Jubilee Quartets, as \\"Lord, I Don't Care Where They Bury My Body\\", in 192729. The various titles are taken from the chorus: \\"Bury my body, Lord, I don't care where; for my soul is gonna live with God\\". As is common with traditional songs, the words vary between performers. The verses sometimes seem to refer to the miracle of the empty tomb; at others to the rapture; at yet others to the singer's indifference to the manner of disposal of his or her remains, as a small matter compared with salvation.

Founded in March 2012 by Stacy Kovacs with an initial membership of 16 women, which eventually grew to a membership of over 65 women ranging in age from 14 to 70 years old, the band changed musical director in July 2016 when members split to form two bands: Batal√° New York and FogoAzul NYC. History Artistic Director Stacy Kovacs first encountered members of Batal√° Mundo performing in the 2011 Brazil Day celebration in New York City. Following this introduction to Batal√° and a growing interest in samba reggae, Kovacs traveled to Brazil in 2012 for that year's Carnaval in Salvador da Bahia. Kovacs brought back 35 drums, and Batal√° NYC had their first rehearsal in March 2012. Batal√° NYC dissolved in July, 2016. Most of its members then created Batal√° New York, a continuation of the original band: an all-female, female-led banda de percuss√£o (percussion-based band) that promotes Afro-Brazilian culture and women's empowerment through high energy, visually stimulating percussion performances. Batal√° New York plays from the same repertoire of northeastern Brazilian songs that Batal√° NYC drew upon. It is a chapter of the broader global arts project Batal√° Mundo. Kovacs, together with some members of the original Batal√° NYC, founded a new musical entity she named FogoAzul NYC, now playing the music of Marcus Santos' music education network Grooversity. FogoAzul NYC now has 70 women drummers who are there to drum and enjoy the music of Grooversity and Brazil. The band takes women of all musical levels, mostly beginners, and teaches them to drum. FogoAzul means Blue Fire in Portuguese. Performances Batal√° NYC performed with notable acts such as The Rolling Stones, participated in many events including New York's Village Halloween Parade, and took part in benefit concerts for One Billion Rising.

The Qing emperors appointed resident commissioners known as Ambans to Tibet, most of them are ethnic Manchus, who reported to the Lifan Yuan, a Qing government body that oversaw the empire's frontier.Emblems of Empire: Selections from the Mactaggart Art Collection, by John E. Vollmer, Jacqueline Simcox, p154 Tibet under Qing rule retained a degree of political autonomy under the Dalai Lamas nonetheless. By the late 19th century, Qing hegemony over Tibet remained in theory but in actuality was a dead letter given the weight of Qing's domestic and foreign-relations burdens.Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History, by R. Keith Schoppa, p341 However, Qing began to take steps to reassert their authority shortly after the British expedition to Tibet in 1903‚Äì04.India Quarterly (volume 7), by Indian Council of World Affairs, p120 After the Qing dynasty was overthrown in 1911, Tibet entered a new political period from 1912 to 1951. History =Background= G√ºshi Khan of the Khoshut in 1641 overthrew the prince of Tsang and made the 5th Dalai Lama the highest spiritual and political authority in Tibet,Ren√© Grousset, The Empire of the Steppes, New Brunswick 1970, p. 522 establishing the regime known as Ganden Phodrang. The time of the 5th Dalai Lama was also a period of rich cultural development. Hongtaiji insulted the Mongols for believing in Tibetan Buddhism. With G√ºshi Khan who founded the Khoshut Khanate as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama conducted foreign policy independently of the Qing, on the basis of his spiritual authority amongst the Mongolians. He acted as a mediator between Mongol tribes, and between the Mongols and the Qing Kangxi Emperor. The Dalai Lama would assign territories to Mongol tribes, and these decisions were routinely confirmed by the Emperor. In 1674, the Emperor asked the Dalai Lama to send Mongolian troops to help suppress Wu Sangui's Revolt of the Three Feudatories in Yunnan. The Dalai Lama refused to send troops, and advised Kangxi to resolve the conflict in Yunnan by dividing China with Wu Sangui. The Dalai Lama openly professed neutrality but he exchanged gifts and letters with Wu Sangui during the war further deepening the Qing's suspicions and angering them against the Dalai Lama. This was apparently a turning point for the Emperor, who began to take action to deal with the Mongols directly, rather than through the Dalai Lama.Smith 1997, pp. 116‚Äì7 The 5th Dalai Lama died in 1682. His regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso, concealed the death and continued to act in his name. In 1688, Galdan Boshugtu Khan of the Khoshut defeated the Khalkha Mongols and went on to battle Qing forces. This contributed to the loss of Tibet's role as mediator between the Mongols and the Emperor. Several Khalkha tribes formally submitted directly to Kangxi. Galdan retreated to Dzungaria. When Sangye Gyatso complained to Kangxi that he could not control the Mongols of Kokonor in 1693, Kangxi annexed Kokonor, giving it the name it bears today, Qinghai. He also annexed Tachienlu in eastern Kham at this time. When Kangxi finally destroyed Galdan in 1696, a Qing ruse involving the name of the Dalai Lama was involved; Galdan blamed the Dalai Lama (still not aware of his death fourteen years earlier) for his ruin.Smith 1997, pp. 117‚Äì120 Potala Palace painting of the 5th Dalai Lama meeting the Shunzhi Emperor in Beijing, 1653. About this time, some Dzungars informed the Kangxi Emperor that the 5th Dalai Lama had long since died. He sent envoys to Lhasa to inquire. This prompted Sangye Gyatso to make Tsangyang Gyatso the 6th Dalai Lama public. He was enthroned in 1697.Smith 1997, pp. 120‚Äì1 Tsangyang Gyatso enjoyed a lifestyle that included drinking, the company of women, and writing love songs.Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, Kleine Geschichte Tibets, M√ºnchen 2006, pp. 109‚Äì122. In 1702, he refused to take the vows of a Buddhist monk. The regent, under pressure from the Emperor and Lhazang Khan of the Khoshut, resigned in 1703. In 1705, Lhazang Khan used the sixth Dalai Lama's escapades as excuse to take control of Lhasa. The regent Sanggye Gyatso, who had allied himself with the Dzungar Khanate, was murdered, and the Dalai Lama was sent to Beijing. He died on the way, near Kokonor, ostensibly from illness but leaving lingering suspicions of foul play. Lhazang Khan appointed a new Dalai Lama who, however, was not accepted by the Gelugpa school. Kelzang Gyatso was discovered near Kokonor and became a rival candidate. Three Gelug abbots of the Lhasa areaMullin 2001, p. 285 appealed to the Dzungar Khanate, which invaded Tibet in 1717, deposed Lhazang Khan's pretender to the position of Dalai Lama, and killed Lhazang Khan and his entire family.Stein 1972, pp. 85‚Äì88 The Dzungars proceeded to loot, rape and kill throughout Lhasa and its environs. They also destroyed a small force in the Battle of the Salween River which the Emperor had sent to clear traditional trade routes.Mullin 2001, p. 288 =Chinese expedition of 1720= wars between Qing Dynasty and Dzungar Khanate In response to the Dzungar occupation of Tibet, a Chinese expedition sent by the Kangxi Emperor, together with Tibetan forces under Polhanas (also spelled Polhaney) of Tsang and Kangchennas (also spelled Gangchenney), the governor of Western Tibet,Mullin 2001, p. 290Smith 1997, p. 125 expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720. They brought Kelzang Gyatso with them from Kumbum to Lhasa and he was installed as the seventh Dalai Lama.Richardson, Hugh E. (1984). Tibet and its History. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, pp. 48‚Äì9. Shambhala. Boston & London. (pbk)Schirokauer, 242 A Chinese protectorate over Tibet (described by Stein as \\"sufficiently mild and flexible to be accepted by the Tibetan government\\") was established at this time, with a garrison at Lhasa, and Kham was annexed to Sichuan. In 1721, the Qing established a government in Lhasa consisting of a council (the Kashag) of three Tibetan ministers, headed by Kangchennas. A Khalkha prince was made amban, or official representative in Tibet of the Qing. Another Khalkha directed the military. The Dalai Lama's role at this time was purely symbolic, but still highly influential because of the Mongols' religious beliefs.Smith 1997, p. 126 The Qing came as patrons of the Khoshut, liberators of Tibet from the Dzungar, and supporters of Kelzang Gyatso, but when they replaced the Khoshut as rulers of Kokonor and Tibet, they earned the resentment of the Khoshut and also the Tibetans of Kokonor. Lobsang Danjin, a grandson of G√ºshi Khan, led a rebellion in 1723. 200,000 Tibetans and Mongols attacked Xining. Central Tibet did not support the rebellion. In fact, Polhanas blocked the rebels' retreat from Qing retaliation. The rebellion was brutally suppressed.Smith 1997, pp. 125‚Äì6 At multiple places such as Lhasa, Batang, Dartsendo, Lhari, Chamdo, and Litang, Green Standard troops were garrisoned throughout the Dzungar war.Wang 2011, p. 30. Green Standard Army troops and Manchu Bannermen were both part of the Qing force who fought in Tibet in the war against the Dzungars.Dai 2009, p. 81. It was said that the Sichuan commander Yue Zhongqi (a descendant of Yue Fei) entered Lhasa first when the 2,000 Green Standard soldiers and 1,000 Manchu soldiers of the \\"Sichuan route\\" seized Lhasa.Dai 2009, pp. 81‚Äì2. According to Mark C. Elliott, after 1728 the Qing used Green Standard Army troops to man the garrison in Lhasa rather than Bannermen.Elliott 2001, p. 412. According to Evelyn S. Rawski both Green Standard Army and Bannermen made up the Qing garrison in Tibet. Rawski 1998, p. 251. According to Sabine Dabringhaus, Green Standard Chinese soldiers numbering more than 1,300 were stationed by the Qing in Tibet to support the 3,000 strong Tibetan army.Dabringhaus 2014, p. 123. =Early rule= The Kangxi Emperor was succeeded by the Yongzheng Emperor in 1722. In 1725, amidst a series of Qing transitions reducing Qing forces in Tibet and consolidating control of Amdo and Kham, Kangchennas received the title of Prime Minister. The Emperor ordered the conversion of all Nyingma to Gelug. This persecution created a rift between Polhanas, who had been a Nyingma monk, and Kangchennas. Both of these officials, who represented Qing interests, were opposed by the Lhasa nobility, who had been allied with the Dzungars and were anti-Qing. They killed Kangchennas and took control of Lhasa in 1727, and Polhanas fled to his native Ngari. Polhanas gathered an army and retook Lhasa in July 1728 against opposition from the Lhasa nobility and their allies. Qing troops arrived in Lhasa in September, and punished the anti-Qing faction by executing entire families, including women and children. The Dalai Lama was sent to Lithang MonasteryMullin 2001, p. 293 in Kham. The Panchen Lama was brought to Lhasa and was given temporal authority over Tsang and Ngari, creating a territorial division between the two high lamas that was to be a long lasting feature of Chinese policy toward Tibet. Two ambans were established in Lhasa, with increased numbers of Qing troops. Over the 1730s, Qing troops were again reduced, and Polhanas gained more power and authority. The Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa in 1735, temporal power remained with Polhanas. The Qing found Polhanas to be a loyal agent and an effective ruler over a stable Tibet, so he remained dominant until his death in 1747.Smith 1997, pp. 126‚Äì131 The Qing had made the region of Amdo and Kham into the province of Qinghai in 1724, and incorporated eastern Kham into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728.Wang Lixiong, \\"Reflections on Tibet\\" , New Left Review 14, March‚ÄìApril 2002:'\\"Tibetan local affairs were left to the willful actions of the Dalai Lama and the shapes [Kashag members]\\", he said. \\"The Commissioners were not only unable to take charge, they were also kept uninformed. This reduced the post of the Residential Commissioner in Tibet to name only.' The Qing government sent a resident commissioner (amban) to Lhasa. A stone monument regarding the boundary between Tibet and neighbouring Chinese provinces, agreed upon by Lhasa and Beijing in 1726, was placed atop a mountain near Bathang, and survived at least into the 19th century.. This boundary, which was used until 1910, ran between the headwaters of the Mekong and Yangtse rivers. Territory east of the boundary was governed by Tibetan chiefs who were answerable to China.Chapman, F. Spencer. (1940). Lhasa: The Holy City, p. 135. Readers Union Ltd., London. The Qing Empire, marked the time when the Qing began to rule these areas. Polhanas' son Gyurme Namgyal took over upon his father's death in 1747. The ambans became convinced that he was going to lead a rebellion, so they killed him. News of the incident leaked out and a riot broke out in the city, the mob avenged the regent's death by killing the ambans. The Dalai Lama stepped in and restored order in Lhasa. The Qianlong Emperor (Yongzheng's successor) sent a force of 800, which executed Gyurme Namgyal's family and seven members of the group that killed the ambans. The Emperor re-organized the Tibetan government again, nominally restoring temporal power to the Dalai Lama, but in fact consolidating power in the hands of the (new) ambans.Smith 1997, pp. 191‚Äì2 The number of soldiers in Tibet was kept at about 2,000. The defensive duties were partly helped out by a local force which was reorganized by the resident commissioner, and the Tibetan government continued to manage day-to-day affairs as before. The Emperor reorganized the Kashag to have four Kal√∂ns in it.Wang 2001, pp. 170‚Äì3 He also drew on Buddhism to bolster support among the Tibetans. Six thangkas remain portraying the emperor as Manju≈õrƒ´ and Tibetan records of the time refer to him by that name.Shirokauer, A Brief History of Chinese Civilization, Thompson Higher Education, (c) 2006, 244 The 7th Dalai Lama died in 1757, and the 8th, Jamphel Gyatso, was born the following year, and was identified and brought to Lhasa in 1762. =Gorkha invasions= In 1779, the third Panchen Lama, a cosmopolitan priest fluent also in Hindi and Persian and well disposed to both Catholic missionaries in Tibet and East India Company agents in India, was invited to Peking for the celebrations of the Emperor's 70th birthday.Frederick W. Mote, Imperial China 900‚Äì1800, Harvard University Press, 2003 p.938.The journey and meeting is described in Kate Teltscher, The high road to China: George Bogle, the Panchen Lama and the first British expedition to Tibet, Bloomsbury Publishing 2007, pp. 208‚Äì226.Shakabka reads this event as illustrating the Preceptor-Patron relationship between China and Tibet. The Emperor wrote a letter which read: The wheel of doctrine will be turned throughout the world through the powerfulk scripture foretold to endure as long as the sky. Next year, you will come to honor the day of by birth, enhancing my state of mind. I am enjoying thinking about your swiftly impending arrival. On the way, Panchen Ertini, you will bring about happiness through spreading Buddhism and affecting the welfare of Tibet and Mongolia. I am presently learning the Tibetan language. When we meet directly, I will speak with you with great joy.' W. D. Shakabpa, One hundred thousand moons, trans. Derek F. Maher, BRILL, 2010, p. 497. In the final stages of his visit, after instructing the Emperor, he contracted smallpox and died in Beijing.In regard to kowtowing, Shakabpa writes:'As they were leaving, the emperor came to visit the all-seeing Rimpoch√©. As the Emperor was to remain there for three days, he went to prostrate to his spiritual father at a place called Tungling.' Shakabpa, ibid.p.500. The following year, the 8th Dalai Lama assumed political power in Tibet. Problematic relations with Nepal led to Gorkha invasions of Tibet, sent by Bahadur Shah, the Regent of Nepal, in 1788 and again in 1791, when Shigatse was occupied and the great Tashilhunpo Monastery, the then seat of the Panchen Lamas, sacked and destroyed. During the first incursion, the Manchu amban in Lhasa spirited away to safety both the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, but otherwise made no attempt to defend the country, though urgent dispatches to Beijing warned that alien powers had designs on the region, and threatened Manchu interests.Frederick W. Mote, Imperial China, p.938. A Qing army found that the Nepalese forces had melted away, and no suppression was necessary. After a renewed incursion in 1791, another army of Manchu and Mongols forces supplemented by strong contingents of Tibetan soldiers (10,000 of 13,000) supplied by local chieftains, repelled this second invasion and pursued the Gorkhas to the Kathmandu Valley. Nepal conceded defeat and returned all the treasure they had plundered.Teltscher 2006, pp. 244‚Äì246 The Qianlong emperor was disappointed with the results of his 1751 decree and the performance of the ambans. A sweeping reform contained in the Twenty-Nine Article Imperial Ordinance of 1793, not only enhanced their status, but ordered them to control border inspections, and serve as conduits through which the Dalai Lama and his cabinet were to communicate. The same Ordinance instituted the Golden Urn system.Derek Maher in W. D. Shakabpa, One hundred thousand moons, translated with a commentary by Derek F. Maher, BRILL, 2010 pp.486‚Äì7. Tibet was clearly subordinate to the Qing by the end of the 18th century. But with the arrival of the 19th century, especially with the weakening of the Qing dynasty itself in the later half of the 19th century, Qing authority over Tibet gradually weakened to the point of being minuscule, or merely symbolic.Goldstein 1989, p44Brunnert, H. S. and Hagelstrom, V. V. Present Day Political Organization of China, Shanghai, 1912. p. 467.http://stason.org/TULARC/travel/tibet/B6-What-was-Tibet-s-status-during- China-s-Qing-dynasty-164.html Chinese historians argue that the ambans' presence was an expression of Chinese sovereignty, while those favouring Tibetan independence claims tend to equate the ambans with ambassadors. The relationship between Tibet and (Qing) China was that of patron and priest and was not based on the subordination of one to the other, according to the 13th Dalai Lama.\\"Proclamation Issued by H.H. The Dalai Lama XIII\\" (The 13th Dalai Lama was deposed in 1904, reinstated in 1908 and deposed again in 1910 by the Qing government, but these pronouncements were not taken seriously in Lhasa.) Tibet, China and the United States: Reflections on the Tibet Question by Melvyn C. Goldstein However, in the 1860s the Tibetans still chose for reasons of their own to emphasize the Qing Empire's symbolic authority and make it seem substantial. =The Golden Urn= The defeat of the 1791 Nepalese invasion increased the Qing's control over Tibet. From that moment, all important matters were to be submitted to the ambans.Chambers' Encyclopedia, Pergamon Press, New York, 1967, p637 Induction of Lungtok Gyatso, 9th Dalai Lama, in the presence of Ambans around 1808. In 1792, the emperor issued a 29-point decree which appeared to tighten Qing control over Tibet. It strengthened the powers of the ambans. The ambans were elevated above the Kashag and the regents in responsibility for Tibetan political affairs. The Dalai and Panchen Lamas were no longer allowed to petition the Chinese Emperor directly but could only do so through the ambans. The ambans took control of Tibetan frontier defense and foreign affairs. Tibetan authorities' foreign correspondence, even with the Mongols of Kokonor (present-day Qinghai), had to be approved by the ambans. The ambans were put in command of the Qing garrison and the Tibetan army (whose strength was set at 3000 men). Trade was also restricted and travel could be undertaken only with documents issued by the ambans. The ambans were to review all judicial decisions. The Tibetan currency, which had been the source of trouble with Nepal, was also taken under Beijing's supervision.Smith, Warren W., Jr., Tibetan Nation: A History Of Tibetan Nationalism And Sino-Tibetan Relations, Westview Press, 1997, , pp 134‚Äì135 However, according to Warren Smith, these directives were either never fully implemented, or quickly discarded, as the Qing were more interested in a symbolic gesture of authority than actual sovereignty; the relationship between Qing and Tibet was one between states, or between an empire and a semi-autonomous state.Smith 1997, p. 137 The Cambridge History of China states that Tibet and Xinjiang were territories of the Qing dynasty since the 18th century. It also outlined a new method to select both the Dalai and Panchen Lama by means of a lottery administered by the ambans in Lhasa. The purpose was to have the Mongol grand-lama QubilŒ≥an found in Tibet rather than from the descendants of the ƒåinggisid aristocracy.Patrick Taveirne,Han-Mongol encounters and missionary endeavors, Leuven University Press, 2004, p.89. In this lottery the names of the competing candidates were written on folded slips of paper which were placed in a golden urn (Mongol altan bumba; Tibetan gser bum:Chinese jƒ´np√≠ng:ÈáëÁì∂).Goldstein 1989, p.44, n.13Taveirne,Han-Mongol encounters, p. 89. The emperor also wanted to play this part in choosing reincarnations because the Gelugpa School of the Dalai Lamas was the official religion of his court.Mullin 2001, p. 358 Despite this attempt to meddle in Tibetan affairs, generally the emperor's urn was politely ignored, except when, in the mid-19th century, Qing support was needed against foreign and Nepalese encroachment. The selection was made by the appropriate Tibetan officials using the previous incarnation's entourage, or labrang,Smith 1996, p. 151 with the selection being approved after the fact by the emperor.Grunfeld 1996, p. 47 In such cases the emperor would also issue an order waiving the use of the urn. The tenth Dalai Lama was actually selected by traditional Tibetan methods, but in response to the amban's insistence, the regent publicly announced that the urn had been used.Smith 1996, pg. 138 The eleventh Dalai Lama was selected by the golden urn method. The twelfth Dalai Lama was selected by the Tibetan method but was confirmed by means of the lottery.Smith 1997, p. 140, n, 59Mullin 2001, pp. 369‚Äì370 Nepal was a tributary state to China from 1788 to 1908.Ashley Eden, British Envoy and Special Commissioner to Sikkim, dispatch to the Secretary of the Government of Bengal, April 1861, quoted in Taraknath Das, British Expansion in Tibet, p12, saying \\"Nepal is tributary to China, Tibet is tributary to China, and Sikkim and Bhutan are tributary to Tibet\\"Wang 2001, pp. 239‚Äì240 In the Treaty of Thapathali signed in 1856 that concluded the Nepalese-Tibetan War, Tibet and Nepal agreed to \\"regard the Chinese Emperor as heretofore with respect.\\"Treaty Between Tibet and Nepal, 1856, Tibet Justice Center Michael van Walt van Praag, legal advisor to the 14th Dalai Lama,History of Tibet Justice Center claims that 1856 treaty provided for a Nepalese mission, namely Vakil, in Lhasa which later allowed Nepal to claim a diplomatic relationship with Tibet in its application for United Nations membership in 1949.Walt van Praag, Michael C. van. The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law, Boulder, 1987, pp. 139‚Äì40 However, the status of Nepalese mission as diplomatic is disputedGrunfeld 1996, p257 and the Nepalese Vakils stayed in Tibet until the 1960s when Tibet had been part of PRC for a decade.Li, T.T., The Historical Status of Tibet, King's Crown Press, New York, 1956Sino-Nepal Agreement of 1956 In 1841, the Hindu Dogra dynasty attempted to establish their authority on √ú-Tsang but were defeated in the Sino-Sikh War (1841‚Äì1842). In the mid 19th century, arriving with an Amban, a community of Chinese troops from Sichuan who married Tibetan women settled down in the Lubu neighborhood of Lhasa, where their descendants established a community and assimilated into Tibetan culture.Yeh 2009, p. 60. Hebalin was the location of where Chinese Muslim troops and their offspring lived, while Lubu was the place where Han Chinese troops and their offspring lived.Yeh 2013, p. 283. =British expedition to Tibet (1903‚Äì1904)= The authorities in British India renewed their interest in Tibet in the late 19th century, and a number of Indians entered the region, first as explorers and then as traders. Treaties regarding Tibet were concluded between Britain and China in 1886,Tibet Justice Center ‚Äì Legal Materials on Tibet ‚Äì Treaties and Conventions Relating to Tibet ‚Äì Convention Relating to Burmah and Thibet (1886) 1890,Tibet Justice Center ‚Äì Legal Materials on Tibet ‚Äì Treaties and Conventions Relating to Tibet ‚Äì Convention Between Great Britain and China Relating to Sikkim and Tibet (1890) ... and 1893,Project South Asia but the Tibetan government refused to recognize their legitimacyPowers 2004, pg. 80 and continued to bar British envoys from its territory. During \\"the Great Game\\", a period of rivalry between Russia and Britain, the British desired a representative in Lhasa to monitor and offset Russian influence. At the beginning of the 20th century the British and Russian Empires were competing for supremacy in Central Asia. A British expedition was dispatched in 1904, officially to resolves border disputes between Tibet and Sikkim. The expedition quickly turned into an invasion and captured Lhasa, with the Dalai Lama fleeing to Mongolia. In response, the Chinese foreign ministry asserted that China was sovereign over Tibet, the first clear statement of such a claim.Michael C. Van Walt Van Praag. The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law, p. 37. (1987). London, Wisdom Publications. . Before the British troops arrived in Lhasa, the 13th Dalai Lama fled to Outer Mongolia, and then to Beijing in 1908. A treaty was signed between the British and the Tibetans that was known as the Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet. The main points of the treaty allowed the British to trade in Yadong, Gyantse, and Gartok while Tibet was to pay a large indemnity of 7,500,000 rupees, later reduced by two-thirds, with the Chumbi Valley ceded to Britain until the imdenity was received. Further provisions recognised the Sikkim-Tibet border and prevented Tibet from entering into relations with other foreign powers. As a result, British economic influence expanded further in Tibet, while at the same time Tibet remained under the sovereignty of the Qing dynasty of China. The Anglo- Tibetan treaty was followed by a Sino-British treaty in 1906 by which the \\"Government of Great Britain engages not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet. The Government of China also undertakes not to permit any other foreign State to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet.\\"Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet (1906) Moreover, Beijing agreed to pay London 2.5 million rupees which Lhasa was forced to agree upon in the Anglo- Tibetan treaty of 1904.Melvyn C. Goldstein, Tibet, China and the United States: Reflections on the Tibet Question. , 1995 In 1907, Britain and Russia agreed that in \\"conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Tibet\\"Convention Between Great Britain and Russia (1907) both nations \\"engage not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government.\\" =Qing control reasserted= Lhasa Amban's yamen from Southeast around 1900‚Äì1901. The Qing dynasty put Amdo under their rule in 1724, and incorporated eastern Kham into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728.The Times Atlas of World History, 1989, p. 175Schirokauer, Conrad. A Brief History of Chinese Civilization, 2006, p. 242Wang 2001, pp. 162‚Äì6 The Qing government ruled these areas indirectly through the Tibetan noblemen. Tibetans claimed that Tibetan control of the Batang region of Kham in eastern Tibet appears to have continued uncontested from the time of an agreement made in 1726 until soon after the British invasion, which alarmed the Qing rulers in China. They sent the imperial official Fengquan (Âá§ÂÖ®) to the region to begin reasserting Qing control, but the locals revolted and killed him and two French Catholic priests and burned the church. The Qing Empire in 1910 with provinces in deep yellow, military governorates and protectorates in light yellow. The British invasion was one of the triggers for the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion at Batang monastery, when anti-foreign Tibetan lamas massacred French missionaries, Manchu and Han Qing officials, and Christian converts before the Qing crushed the revolt. The Qing government in Beijing then appointed Zhao Erfeng, the Governor of Xining, \\"Army Commander of Tibet\\" to reintegrate Tibet into China. He was sent in 1905 (though other sources say this occurred in 1908)FOSSIER Astrid, Paris, 2004 \\"L‚ÄôInde des britanniques √† Nehru : un acteur cl√© du conflit sino-tib√©tain.\\" on a punitive expedition. His troops destroyed a number of monasteries in Kham and Amdo, and a process of sinification of the region was begun.Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, Kleine Geschichte Tibets, M√ºnchen 2006, p. 140fGoldstein 1989, p. 46f The Dalai Lama's title's was restored in November 1908. He was about to return to Lhasa from Amdo in the summer of 1909 when the Chinese decided to send military forces to Lhasa to control him. With their 1910 expedition to Tibet the Dalai Lama once again fled, this time to India, and was once again deposed by the Chinese.Goldstein 1989, p. 49ff The situation was soon to change, however, as, after the fall of the Qing dynasty in October 1911, Zhao's soldiers mutinied and beheaded him.Hilton 2000, p. 115Goldstein 1989, p. 58f All remaining Qing forces left Tibet after the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil. In 1909 the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin returned from a three-year-long expedition to Tibet, having mapped and described a large part of inner Tibet. During his travels, he visited the 9th Panchen Lama. For some of the time, Hedin had to camouflage himself as a Tibetan shepherd (because he was European).The Swedish newspaper F√§derneslandet, 1909-01-16 In an interview following a meeting with the Russian czar he described the situation as follows: > \\"Currently, Tibet is in the cramp-like hands of China¬¥s government. The > Chinese realize that if they leave Tibet for the Europeans, it will end its > isolation in the East. That is why the Chinese prevent those who wish to > enter Tibet.

The company used investments from Javelin Venture Partners in December 2013 to improve their team and community support, as well as launch new services.   * Overview Plug.dj consists of different online chat rooms, called \\"communities\\", that users can freely create. Inside each community, users can choose to join a wait list and wait for their turn to be the DJ for everyone else in the community, playing a video or song chosen from either YouTube or SoundCloud, or simply listen passively. Users can also vote positively or negatively for each song or video played, or add it to their own playlists. By spending time or being active on the site, they earn experience points (XP) and plug points (PP), which are used to unlock and purchase various items, such as new avatars and chat badges. Each community on plug.dj is typically focused on a few specific musical genres, usually one of the subgenres of EDM (Electronic Dance Music), such as Trap, Dubstep, Electro, Drum'n'Bass and many others. Communities dedicated to non-electronic genres, such as rock, jazz, death metal, and classical also exist. The community creator is able to promote users to moderators to help ensure the community's rules are followed and to keep the environment friendly. Volunteer global moderators, called \\"Brand Ambassadors\\", also exist. In April 2015, a paid subscription service was launched, which provides access to subscriber avatars and badges without the user having to spend PP. Financial issues On September 14, 2015, plug.dj announced that the service would be shutting down if it was unable to raise enough money to support the running of the service by a disclosed deadline of September 28 through a donation drive. It was noted by the administrators of plug.dj that the company was forced to sell their office and developers were to work from home in order to reduce running costs. Other attempts to reduce costs, like another tier in plug.dj subscription system, rewriting some portions of the backend in Go (plug.dj was previously written in Python, a less-efficient and consequently more expensive programming language to operate under) and cutting staff were unsuccessful in keeping the service afloat. On September 28, 2015, having not met their donation goal in time, the plug.dj service went offline at 3 PM Pacific Standard Time and the closure of its parent company, Plug DJ Inc. followed at an unknown date. Relaunch On December 10, 2015, plug.dj posted a message on their Facebook page, saying \\"The hype is real\\". Later, on February 8, 2016, another post was made explaining that the service will likely return under new management at an unannounced date. The site was bought by Rowl, Inc and relaunched on May 31, 2016 with the existing user database restored. This brought all playlists back allowing users to keep all data that they had previously.

Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2012. Reference. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY (NYU). 5 December 2012 Between 1923 and 1948, approximately 7,300 Jews emigrated from Turkey to Mandatory Palestine. After the 1934 Thrace pogroms following the 1934 Turkish Resettlement Law, immigration to Palestine increased; it is estimated that 521 Jews left for Palestine from Turkey in 1934 and 1,445 left in 1935. Immigration to Palestine was organized by the Jewish Agency and the Palestine Aliya Anoar Organization. The Varlƒ±k Vergisi, a capital tax which occurred in 1942, was also significant in encouraging emigration from Turkey to Palestine; between 1943 and 1944, 4,000 Jews emigrated. The Jews of Turkey reacted very favorably to the creation of the State of Israel. Between 1948 and 1951, 34,547 Jews immigrated to Israel, nearly 40% of the Jewish population at the time. Immigration was stunted for several months in November 1948, when Turkey suspended migration permits as a result of pressure from neighboring Arab countries. In March 1949, the suspension was removed when Turkey officially recognized Israel, and emigration continued, with 26,000 emigrating within the same year. The migration was entirely voluntary, and was primary driven by economic factors given the majority of emigrants were from the lower classes. In fact, the migration of Jews to Israel is the second largest mass emigration wave out of Turkey, the first being the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.when most of them arrived to Israel As with many other Jews from the Middle east and North Africa they were put into Transit camps or Ma'abarot. After 1951, emigration of Jews from Turkey to Israel slowed materially. In the mid 1950s, 10% of those who had moved to Israel returned to Turkey. A new synagogue, the Neve ≈ûalom was constructed in Istanbul in 1951. Generally, Turkish Jews in Israel have integrated well into society and are not distinguishable from other Israelis.Toktas, Sule. \\"Cultural Identity, Minority Position and Immigration: Turkey's Jewish Minority vs. Turkish-Jewish Immigrants in Israel.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 44.3 (2008): 511-25.

In recent years during the rule of Recep Tayyip Erdogan and deteriorating relations between Turkey and Israel, rising anti-Semitism, perceived threats to the personal security of Jews in Turkey and rising anti-Jewish discrimination from Turkish society caused a new wave of emigration from Turkey to Israel.

He is the 11th Anglican bishop of the Lebombo, Mozambique. The second Mozambican-born bishop of Lebombo, he is the symbolic head of the Anglican church in Mozambique. Matsinhe was formerly the dean of Maciene Cathedral, serving for over 15 years. Matsinhe's theology embraces the social tradition within Anglicanism and advocates an active participation of the church in education, health and environmental affairs. Early life and education Matsinhe was born in Homoine, Mozambique. He was educated in a nearby Roman Catholic missionary school and subsequently went to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception College in the city of Inhambane. Supported by former Bishop Daniel Pina Cabral, from 1975 to 1979, Matsinhe studied theology and trained for priesthood at St. Mark Anglican Seminary in Dar-es-Salaam, which was affiliated to Makerere University one of Africa's oldest higher learning institutions. Ministry Matsinhe was made deacon in 1979 while simultaneously working as a translator and time and standards technician at Mabor General, a state owned tyre manufacturing company. On January 6, 1980 he was ordained priest and then became rector to the parish of SS. Stephen and Lawrence, and later dean of St. Augustine's Cathedral, from 1998 to 2014. During his tenure he also acted as a chaplain to the Anglican youth (1981-1987), chaplain to The Mission to Seafarers, a role he remembers with great joy. ‚ÄúThat was one of my doors to the world. When a ship arrived I had to be there to welcome the seamen, show them the Post Office...because at that time boats spent long periods docked in the port.‚Äù While at St. Stephen and St. Lawrence, Matsinhe and congregation members developed a Street Children Rehabilitation Centre which sought to provide shelter, education and re- integration of street children in society. The centre also trained children in soap-making, sewing, batik, visual arts and lasted nearly 25 years. In the 35 years of work for the diocese, Matsinhe also coordinated a theological exchange program with Brazil, England, Sweden, and the U.S., and represented the Anglican Church of Southern Africa in the 7th General Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Canberra, Australia. Education career Matsinhe played a major role in education and is widely regarded has one of the pioneers in the development of the private education sector in post- Marxist Mozambique, to help curb the shortage of college places in the public system. In collaboration with the DanChurchAid, Matsinhe fundraised and coordinated the construction of The Anglican School of St. Cyprian in Maputo. This facility accommodated about 1,500 students a year and catalyzed the creation of a network of private colleges in Maputo. Matsinhe was also central in the creation of the Paulo Mabumo Arts Centre, an arts and craft centre training artisans in embroidery, weaving, dying and making of recycled paper using leaves, bark, roots, petals, and recyclables. Recently he also worked with ALMA London, in the reconstruction of the Maciene primary and secondary school. Since his appointment to Bishop of Lebombo, Matsinhe has turned his focus to the development and construction of a theology school, set to also serve candidates to priesthood from Angola. Land Law Former president of the Mozambican Association of Mutual Aid (ORAM), Matsinhe also contributed in the revision and extension of the Land law. Acting as an interlocutor between peasants and the state, promoted accessibility of land and dissemination of information on Land rights and Protection mechanisms. Advocating a non- privatization of the land, ORAM is now proposing a revision of the mining law to ensure transparency and ethics in the exploitation of the vast natural gas reserves resources that the country now sits on. Bishop of Lebombo Matsinhe emerged as a candidate to be the next bishop of Lebombo in March 2014, when the Rt. Revd. Dinis Sengulane announced his retirement after leading the church for 38 years. His election as the Bishop of Lebombo took place on August 10, 2014 at St. Augustine's Cathedral after a voting process led by Thabo Makgoba, the Archbishop of Cape Town. Matsinhe was consecrated Bishop of Lebombo on September 28, 2014 at Pavilh√£o do Maxaquene. Personal life Matsinhe is married to Hort√™ncia Samuel and together they have five children, Sim√£o, Melita, Samito, Gra√ßa and Artur.

It is able to store, fuse, search and analyze data from numerous sources, from intercepted communications to open source information. It was effective in providing information about Iraqi insurgents who had eluded less comprehensive techniques.  Development  The prototype of the Real Time Regional Gateway (RT-RG) was designed by the military and intelligence contractor SAIC. Instead of storing all data in centralized databases, as was NSA's traditional approach, RT-RG uses distributed computing, which means hundreds or even thousands of individual computers work together on one task. This is managed by the Hadoop software, that was originally developed by Yahoo. The NSA created its own version, called Accumulo, which can manage extremely large data sets and also includes granular access controls. The successor of the Real Time Regional Gateway is named Nexus 7 and is now under development at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) At NSA the driving force behind the system was former NSA director Keith B. Alexander, who initiated a massive search for every piece of electronic information that could be found, after the Iraqi road side bombings reached an all-time high in 2005.Washington Post: For NSA chief, terrorist threat drives passion to ‚Äòcollect it all‚Äô, July 14, 2013 Alexander's \\"collect it all\\" strategy is believed by Glenn Greenwald to be the model for the comprehensive worldwide mass collection of communications which NSA is supposedly engaged in.  Origins and deployment in Iraq  Under the secret interception programs that were started right after the September 11 attacks, which were codenamed STELLARWIND, the NSA got access to foreign communications at the switching points where international fiber-optic cables entered the United States. This enabled NSA not only to monitor many communications from Iraq, but also to initiate cyber attacks against Iraqi telephone and computer equipment.Shane Harris, \\"@War, The Rise of the Military-Internet Complex\\", Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, New York, 2014, p. 33-38. When the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 began, the NSA exported this all-encompassing way of intelligence gathering and analysing to Iraq. As its name describes, the Real Time Regional Gateway was a gateway through which all sorts of information related to one region (Iraq) became available to analysts and soldiers in real time and they could search the data similar to a search-engine like Google. The RT-RG derived its data from all kinds of sources, like raids, interrogations, and signal intelligence collected from ground sensors, as well as by airborne platforms like the RC-135 Rivet Joint and C-12 Huron aircraft, and SIGINT drones and satellites.Dana Priest, William M. Arkin, Top Secret America: The Rise of the New American Security State, Little, Brown and Company, 2011. With the RT-RG, field commanders and intelligence analysts in the field were for the first time able to directly access NSA databases, making that intercepted data were ten times faster available on the ground than in the past.Matthew M. Aid, Intel Wars: The Secret History of the Fight Against Terror, Bloomsbury, 2012. On a screen they were provided with \\"every type of surveillance available in a given territory\\" and they could also \\"get back a phone number or list of potential targets\\".Washington Post: NSA growth fueled by need to target terrorists, July 22, 2013. One of the developers of the RT-RG, was Pedro \\"Pete\\" Rustan from the US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). In a 2010 interview he said that the system was designed to put together pieces from a different types of data sources, looking for patterns, and make this available directly to American warfighters on the ground.Defensenews.com: Change agent , October 8, 2010. The Real Time Regional Gateway contributed to \\"breaking up Iraqi insurgent networks and significantly reducing the monthly death toll from improvised explosive devices (IED) by late 2008\\". According to journalist and author Shane Harris, the RT-RG was \\"a rare example of successful collaboration within the byzantine federal bureaucracy\\" and eventually the key for winning the war in Iraq.  Deployment in Afghanistan  In 2010, RT-RG refocused on Afghanistan, where it was used to fuse and analyze even more types of data. Besides the more traditional military intelligence information, this included for example road-traffic patterns, public opinion and even the price of potatoes, because changes in the latter could indicate potential conflicts. Initially these data were gathered and analyzed for 30-day periods, but later this was extended to 90 days, as adding more data appeared to give better results. A former US counterterrorism official described the RT-RG as \\"the ultimate correlation tool\\" adding that \\"It is literally being able to predict the future\\".Wall Street Journal: Technology Emboldened the NSA, June 9, 2013.

He was the only son of Wenceslaus of P≈Çock and Dannila (Elisabeth), a daughter of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. Life A minor at the time of his father's death in 1336, Boles≈Çaw III inherited his domains under the regency of his paternal uncles Siemowit II and Trojden I until 1340, when he attained his majority and began his personal government. Five years later (1345), the death of Siemowit II childless allowed him to inherited the districts of Wizna and Sochaczew. Probably since the beginning of his reign, Boles≈Çaw III paid homage to King John of Bohemia, who guaranteed the integrity of his domains, located between two powerful neighbors, the Teutonic Order and Poland. In order to continue under the protection of Bohemia even in the case of the King's death, on 30 September 1341 Boles≈Çaw III renewed his homage, this time to Prince Charles, eldest son and heir of King John. In 1343 Boles≈Çaw III, jointly with the other Masovian rulers, confirmed the Treaty of Kalisz and agreed to resign the district of Che≈Çmno to Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania. However, during the second half of the 1340s Boles≈Çaw III began to distance from his policy of cooperation with the Kingdom of Bohemia, and began to approached to the Polish King Casimir III the Great. At some point, even Boles≈Çaw III agreed to name the Polish King his heir in default of male offspring, which clearly was against the policy of the Luxembourg dynasty, rulers of Bohemia. In 1351 Boles≈Çaw III, together with Casimir III the Great and Louis I of Hungary, took part in the expedition against his maternal uncle Kƒôstutis, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The campaign was a complete success, especially since on 15 August 1351 was concluded with the Lithuanians a truce under which Kƒôstutis accept Christianity and to this end, he was placed under the care of the Duke of P≈Çock as an honorable prisoner. However, soon became notorious that Kƒôstutis had no intentions to comply with the agreement, because five days later (20 August), he decided to escape in his route to Buda after attacked Boleslaw III by surprise with his troops. In his persecution of Kƒôstutis, Boles≈Çaw III was killed at Mƒõln√≠k by an arrow from a bow, and the Lithuanian Grand Duke, without difficulties, could escape to his domains. He was buried at P≈Çock Cathedral (according to the reports of Jan D≈ÇugoszBoles≈Çaw III p≈Çocki in poczet.com [retrieved 24 January 2015].). Because Boles≈Çaw III died unmarried and childless, after his death his domains were divided. King Casimir III took P≈Çock and Wizna and the Duke's cousins Siemowit III and Casimir I obtained Gostynin and Sochaczew. Despite this, Boles≈Çaw III's brother-in-law Henry V of ≈ªaga≈Ñ obtained the investiture of the whole Duchy of P≈Çock from the Bohemian Kingdom, but he never could conquer the land.

The larnax is dated to the fourteenth century BC, which corresponds to the Late Minoan III A period, and probably comes from the island of Crete. It entered the antiquities collection of the Museum August Kestner in 1989 (inventory number 1989.30) Larnakes are clay sarcophagi modelled on wood and were a standard part of Minoan funerary practices. The Hanover larnax survives largely complete except for the fragmentary lid. Missing portions, especially on one of the short sides, have been reconstructed in modern times. The remains of the lid have been connected together and partially restored. The lid is decorated with two bands of waves, one on top of the other. The lid has the form of a pitched roof, flattened where it meets the edge of the sarcophagus, so that it sits firmly on the sarcophagus. The sarcophagus itself is painted on all four sides. On the main side, a tree is shown in the centre, with dogs on either side chasing after goats above them, which have been pierced by spears. One of the short sides shows two wild goats fighting each other, the other short side and the reverse have floral motifs. The interior of the sarcophagus is not nearly as carefully worked as the outside. At the edges of the longs sides, handle holes have been created, but on both sides they only survive at one end. The sarcophagus' legs are protruding pillars at all four corners, which run from the rim to the ground. Apart from a column on the back side, which was decorated with floral patterns, all columns are decorated with thick painted stripes alternating with bare clay.

In the studio he both copied designs and worked as an agent for Barocci's large studio, assuring compliance with patron's wishes, delivering, or completing commissions sent outside of Umbria. In 1604 Mazza restored the stucco model of the statue of Federico da Montefeltro by Girolamo Campagna (made using designs of Barocci) for the Ducal Palace of Urbino.

She received degrees in geology, fine art, and guidance counseling. She described a new genus, Rhombopsammia, and three new species of button corals, R. niphada, R. squiresi, and Letepsammia franki. Early life and family Joan Murrell was born on June 30, 1933, in Miami, Florida, to William and Leola Murrell. She was the youngest of their three daughters. Her father was a dentist. Encouraged by her parents, from an early age Joan became interested in the life of the oceans, and she hoped to study marine biology professionally. Her father was an avid fisherman who took his wife and daughters on weekend fishing trips, during which Owens became interested in marine life. One of her favorite books was The Silent World by Jacques Cousteau. Mueller graduated from Miami's Booker T. Washington High School in 1950 and was awarded two scholarships, one from the Pepsi-Cola Company and a Sarah Maloney (Art Scholarship) at Fisk University. Joan entered Fisk University in 1950. The scholarships subsidized part of her education with her father paying the major portion of her tuition. However, the university did not offer a program in the marine sciences. Instead, she majored in fine art and received her degree in 1954; her minors were mathematics and psychology. For graduate study, Murrell entered the University of Michigan with the intention to study commercial art, but she changed her focus. She received a Master of Science degree in guidance counseling with an emphasis on reading therapy in 1956. Teaching and research Joan Murrell taught for two years at the University of Michigan's Children's Psychiatric Hospital, and then joined the faculty of Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1957, where she specialized in teaching remedial English. In the 1960s, she moved to Newton, Massachusetts. While there, for the Institute for Services to Education she designed programs for teaching English to educationally disadvantaged students. This work served as a model for the Upward Bound program of the United States Department of Education. She returned to Washington; with a renewed interest in marine biology, and the encouragement of her friend and colleague Philip Morrison, she entered George Washington University in 1970. As that institution had no undergraduate program in marine science, she constructed an equivalent with a major in geology and a minor in zoology. She received her B.S. in geology in 1973 and her M.S. in 1976. Continuing work toward her doctorate, she returned to Howard as a professor of geology in 1976. Because Owens had sickle cell anemia traits, her research was limited by her inability to dive underwater to search for specimens. Instead, she did a laboratory project at the Smithsonian Institution, working with coral samples collected by a British expedition in 1880. Her doctoral research concerned certain species of deep-sea button corals, a group of stony corals that are distinctive in that they do not form colonies. Her dissertation was titled \\"Microstructural Changes in the Scleractinian Families Micrabaciidae and Fungiidae and their Taxonomic and Ecologic Implications.\\" She received her PhD from George Washington University in 1984. Now publishing as Joan Murrell Owens, she continued her laboratory work at the Smithsonian, classifying and studying button corals, while advancing to the rank of associate professor in the department of geology and geography at Howard University in 1986. She described the new genus Rhombopsammia and its two species in 1986, and added a new species to the genus Letepsammia in 1994, naming L. franki for her husband, Frank A. Owens. Both genera are in the family Micrabaciidae. Joan Owens transferred to the biology department of Howard in 1992 when the department of geology and geography was phased out, and retired from full-time work in 1995. Later life and death Joan Owens died on May 25, 2011. She was survived by her sister, Willette M. Carlton; two daughters, Adrienne Lewis and Angela Owens; and a granddaughter, Chara Johnson.

The song was written by Matthew Koma and produced by Greg Kurstin. It is a pulsatic trance track, about a defunct relationship, in which a singer sings of a false apology to a former lover while also wishing him to find someone to love in the future. \\"Someone\\" was released by RCA Records as the fifth and final promotional single from Piece by Piece on February 27, 2015. The song received mainly positive views from music critics.  Background and composition  \\"Someone\\" is written by Matthew Koma and produced by Greg Kurstin. Koma wrote the song while he was still finishing recording with his debut studio album, Arcadia. Lyrically, it is a trance ballad of ambivalence following a breakup in a relationship, in which the singer derides her lover by singing a false apology for saying \\"shitty\\" things to him while also hoping for him to find someone to love in life. New York Daily News chief music critic Jim Farber remarked that the song is a classic non-apology apology ballad, saying that she wishes she didn't have to say such awful things to a foe. Containing a censored profane word, the song made Piece by Piece her first studio album to be censored by the Australian Recording Industry Association.  Release and critical reception  Prior to the release of Piece by Piece, Clarkson shared the lyrics of the chorus of \\"Someone\\" on her website. \\"Someone\\" was first released by RCA Records on February 23, 2015 as the fifth and final promotional single from Piece by Piece. Upon its release, the track debuted at the top ten of the American iTunes Store for the week ending February 28, 2015. A Frank Pole remix of the song was included on Clarkson's first remix album, Piece by Piece Remixed (2016). \\"Someone\\" received positive reviews by music critics upon its release. The Guardians Carolline Sullivan praised the song as one of Clarkson's greatest kiss-off ballads, writing that she sings the track with the \\"utmost purity of tone\\". Reviewing Piece by Piece for New York Daily News, Farber lauded the song as one of the album's most interesting tracks, saying that it repeats Clarkson's flair for the passive aggressive put-down. Jonathan Riggs of Idolator praised \\"Someone\\" as having some of the \\"best, most striking lyrics in recent memory\\", remarking that it elegantly traces how breakups bring out our kindest and meanest selves. Colin McGuirre of PopMatters shared a similar response, describing it as serving the best illustration of \\"that Clarksonian candor we've grown to love.\\" Glenn Gamboa of Newsday also praised the song for being \\"[t]he closest we get to any of Clarkson's previously brassy attitude, calling it a \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"lush synth ballad [...] that caps the tale of an imploding relationship with the tag line, 'I'm sorry I'm not sorry'.\\" Kyle Downling of Music Times praised the track for having \\"great lyrics, a lot of heart and a very interesting story.\\"  Credits and personnel  Credits adapted from the Piece by Piece liner notes and \\"Someone\\" metadata.

Written by Jesse Shatkin and MoZella, the song is produced by Shatkin. A midtempo EDM gospel tune, it is a song of encouragement and escapism, in which the singer lends a hand to the despondent. Musically featuring an auto-tuned EDM breakdown, Shatkin described its sound as \\"an electronic banger\\" and \\"a little left-of-center\\", while Clarkson commented that it reminded her of the music of soundtrack to the 1999 film Cruel Intentions. \\"Take You High\\" was released by RCA Records as the fourth and penultimate promotional single from Piece by Piece on February 26, 2015. Upon its release, it has received a positive response from music critics, some of whom commended the record as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson has included the song in her set list during the Piece by Piece Tour, performing it featuring a portion of the song \\"When Doves Cry\\" by Prince.  Release and composition  \\"Take You High\\" was first released by RCA Records as the fourth and penultimate promotional single from Piece by Piece on February 26, 2015. Clarkson revealed the reason for its promotional release was for listeners to make a wider option in assessing the album as a whole, not just based on its lead single, \\"Heartbeat Song\\". \\"Take You High\\" is a midtempo EDM gospel track produced by Jesse Shatkin, who also co-wrote the song with MoZella. Joseph Trapanese also took part in its arranging and conducting an orchestra during its production. Starting off with a slow melody, it turns into an upbeat chorus, with Clarkson's vocals twiddled with auto-tuned electronic effects accompanied with orchestral strings, synthesizers, and percussion to produce a breakdown. The Dallas Morning Newss Hunter Hawk described the breakdown as the song's biggest hook and observed that it does not contain a proper lyrical content, lauding it as sonic surprise on Piece by Piece. However, The Nationals Rob Garratt discerned it as \\"at odds\\" with its chorus. Whereas The A.V. Clubs Annie Zaleski pointed out that its digitally scribbled breakdown adds a modern flourish that balances out the song's soaring strings. According to the sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation, \\"Take You High\\" is written in the key of A major with a moderate tempo. Lyrically, it is a song of encouragement and escapism, in which the singer lends a hand to the despondent. Shatkin himself described its sound as \\"an electronic banger\\" and \\"a little left-of-center\\", but also having a haunting melody that he thought Clarkson was attracted to. While Clarkson herself remarked that it reminded her of the soundtrack to the 1999 feature film Cruel Intentions.  Critical reception  Critically, \\"Take You High\\" has received a mainly positive response from music pundits, with some of them, such as Slant Magazine's Alexa Camp, The Dallas Morning Newss Hauk, and Idolator's Bianca Gracie, pointed out the track as an album's primary standout. In her review for Slant, Camp exemplified the song's music as a refreshingly unexpected moment on the album as well as in Clarkson's whole career in general, lamenting that those moments are far too sparse in it. Reviewing all of the album's tracks for The Dallas Morning Newss Guide Live section, Hauk that Clarkson's vocals builds drama throughout its verses and pre-chorus, before surrendering to a swirling blend of chopped up vocal samples. Idolator's Gracie remarked in her review that \\"Take You High\\" is not a typical gospel-flecked song, pegging it as unusual for its sonic effects, vocals, synths and percussion. Reviewing for The Observer, Michael Cragg commended Clarkson for experimenting on splintered electronics on \\"Take You High\\". While the New York Posts Hardeep Phull complimentary regarded its sound as a \\"fractured EDM\\" that brings a contemporary feel to Clarkson's new material without resorting to desperate, Day-Glo antics. In his review of Piece by Piece, PopMatters's Colin McGuire, was ambivalent but fair-spoken for the song, who limned it as a clear play on the current EDM boom that works if one had listened to it enough, despite its first impression's intentions being questionable. Jamieson Cox of Billboard was also lukewarm in his response, describing it as one of the album's drab moments.  Live performances and potential single release  Clarkson has included \\"Take You High\\" in her set list for the Piece by Piece Tour to support the album, performing it featuring a portion of the song \\"When Doves Cry\\", which was originally sung by Prince. She also revealed in interviews about their plans to commission dance remixes for the song and a possible release as the single from Piece by Piece in the future.

Produced by former DC Talk member Jason Halbert, the song was written by artists who also have been members of various rock bands: Semi Precious Weapons lead singer Justin Tranter, former Cobra Starship lead guitarist Ryland Blackinton, Young Love lead singer Dan Keyes, and Oliver duo member Vaughn Oliver. A synth electro rock song, it sings of remembering nostalgia of a failed relationship, which was mainly based on Tranter's and Keyes's real life experiences. The record mainly features synthesizer sounds that were prominently popular during the 1980s as well as string arrangements by Joseph Trapanese and guitars by Tim Pierce. Upon the release of Piece by Piece, \\"Nostalgic\\" has received a very positive response from music critics, who lauded the track as one of the album's highlights and complimented the 1980s nostalgia evoked from the song.  Background and composition  The lyrics of \\"Nostalgic\\" was mainly based from Justin Tranter (pictured) and Dan Keyes's life experiences. In 2012, Tranter relocated from New York City to Los Angeles after while completing the release of Semi Precious Weapons' third studio album, Aviation. While finding a record label to release their album, Tranter signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music to write material for other artists. Aviation was finally released in 2014, and Tranter met with Ryland Blackinton, Dan Keyes and Vaughn Oliver for a writing session in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. Musically, \\"Nostalgic\\" is a synth electro rock song, with music critics comparing it sonically to the 1980s sounds of the musical acts Phoenix, Roxette, and Tegan and Sara. According to the sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation, \\"Nostalgic\\" is written in the key of F major with a moderate tempo. Lyrically, it sings of someone reminiscing both the good and bad moments of a failed relationship, during which the singer becomes nostalgic while finally acknowledging its culmination. The song is based primarily on Tranter's and Keyes's past relationships, with Tranter himself coming up with an idea of a song titled \\"Nostalgic\\", coming up with the main lyric \\"Even though we lost it, I still get nostalgic.\\" Tranter sang the demo of the track and sent it to Clarkson who recorded it with Halbert in 2013. Upon hearing Clarkson's final version of the track, Tranter revealed that he was overwhelmed. He remarked, \\"having listened to my demo for over a year and then going to New York, where I used to live, and hearing (Clarkson's) version in the RCA offices. I was a total loser‚ÄîI started crying in this meeting with all these executives. I was like, 'I can't believe this is my life, I'm so happy.'\\"  Critical reception  \\"Nostalgic\\" has received a very positive response from various music critics, most of them complimenting the 1980s nostalgia evoked from the song. Editors of Entertainment Weekly included it as one of their \\"16 songs we're loving this spring\\" list, citing that Clarkson's lost-love anthem, which is tinged with shimmering synths and the most ladylike of power chords, is potent even if one is only \\"nostalgic\\" for Lisa Frank stickers and Day-Glo fanny packs. Reviewing for The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski remarked that Clarkson's voice cracks with bluesy grit of the track, and commended that as one of the loose moments that energizes the album. In his review for The Dallas Morning Newss Guide Live section, music critic Hunter Hauk wrote that \\"Nostalgic\\" amounts to a perfect pop confection. Reviewing Piece by Piece for Idolator, Jonathan Riggs complimented the song as a \\"sister-in-song\\" of \\"Stronger\\" (2011). The Plain Dealers Troy L. Smith praised \\"Nostalgic\\" as fantastic as it takes the listener on a trip back to the 1980s. In both their interviews with Clarkson, Official Charts Company's editor Rob Cobsey and Glamours Alyse Whitney extolled it as a great song, with Cobsey also endorsing it to her as a prospective single. Jason Scott of Popdust.com praised it as the most adventurous of all the album's tracks. Chuck Arnold of Rolling Stone also complimented Clarkson's vocals over the synth strut the track, along with its 1980s homage. However, Slant Magazine's Alexa Camp was indifferent to the song, saying that the songs that should ostensibly inspire nostalgia instead feel like they just rolled off a conveyor belt.

The episode was written by Aristotle Kousakis, directed by Joaquin Sedillo, and first aired on March 13, 2015, on Fox in the United States. The episode features the Show Choir Sectionals competition, with New Directions desperate to win and save their club. Rachel Berry must decide whether to accept a role in a new Broadway show or return to school at NYADA. Sue Sylvester, who is the new coach of Vocal Adrenaline, is apparently going all out in her perennial efforts to defeat New Directions, though she later claims to have had other plans. The episode features the return of special guest star Jonathan Groff as Jesse St. James. Plot While New Directions practice a dance routine for the imminent Sectionals competition, their new members from the Warblers complain that Roderick (Noah Guthrie) and Spencer Porter (Marshall Williams) are poor dancers, and will ruin the number. Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) suggests that they stay in the back for the good of the team, and they later go to her for help with their dancing. While they practice, Spencer injures his ankle. Football coach Sheldon Beiste diagnoses a very severe sprain, and recommends that he not compete, but Spencer insists that he be given a cortisone shot on the day of Sectionals despite the risk of permanent damage to his ankle. Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) continues to urge Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) to return to school at NYADA, while she seems more intent on accepting the role she has been offered on Broadway. Alone, she begins to sing and is joined by former boyfriend and rival Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), who tells her that he is the male lead in that Broadway musical and urges her to take the part. Later, Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and Rachel talk, and he tells her that she has the rare chance to revisit her decision of a year ago and take a different path, though he will support her whatever she decides. Boxes placed in the choir room turn out to be glitter bombs, which inundate the room and destroy the piano. People throughout the school are vomiting, and Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) discovers that Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) tainted the water supply and sent the bombs. She also firebombs his car. Will gets his revenge by masquerading as Sue's hairdresser and forcibly shaving her head bald. At Sectionals, the Falconers go first, performing with live falcons. Vocal Adrenaline, coached by Sue who is wearing a wig resembling her normal hair, does an elaborate performance with set pieces, ending their final song with a pair of human cannonballs. Rachel leads New Directions in a show circle pep talk before their set. Spencer is about to get his cortisone shot, but Roderick stops him, and offers another plan: Spencer appears in \\"Chandelier\\" by swinging in on one of the stage's chandeliers, and sings and dances in the final number while on crutches. After the judges deliberate, New Directions wins Sectionals, with a disgruntled Vocal Adrenaline in second place. Afterward, Sue meets Will and claims that because Will was one of the few people to stand up for her during the recent television expos√© of her by Geraldo Rivera, she planned her pranks to help New Directions perform better, and deliberately sabotaged Vocal Adrenaline by devising a performance that would alienate the judges. Rachel finds Jesse in the auditorium, and tells him that she has decided to return to NYADA, and has turned down the Broadway role. Jesse is disappointed but understanding, and they kiss. New Directions says goodbye to Rachel as they place the Sectionals trophy in their trophy case, and decide to also bring back the trophies from past years. Sue observes this from the hallway with a small smile. Production The episode was written by first-time Glee writer and script coordinator Aristotle Kousakis, and directed by first-time Glee director and regular director of photography Joaquin Sedillo. Special guest star Jonathan Groff returned as former Vocal Adrenaline lead singer and coach Jesse St. James. Recurring characters included New Directions members Kitty Wilde (Tobin), Spencer Porter (Williams), Mason McCarthy (Billy Lewis Jr.), Madison McCarthy (Laura Dreyfuss), Jane Hayward (Samantha Marie Ware), Roderick (Guthrie), Myron Muskovitz (J.J. Totah) and Alistair (Finneas O'Connell), returning Sectionals judges Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones) and Donna Landries (Patricia Forte), and Vocal Adrenaline lead singer Clint (Max George). Fortune Feimster is introduced as Butch Melman, a champion dog trainer who also judges the Sectionals competition.

D. Weldon (1908 ‚Äì May 6, 1989)http://records.ancestry.com/l_d_weldon_records.ashx?pid=44129298 was an American track and field coach. He trained decathletes, including two Olympic medal winners, 40 years apart. Early career A native of California, in 1925 Weldon moved to Graceland Academy in Lamoni, Iowa for the final two years of high school. He continued there to Graceland University for his first year of college before transferring to the University of Iowa. As an athlete at Graceland, he won the javelin throw at the nearby Drake Relays and at the Kansas Relays in 1928. After a year of forced ineligibility due to the change in schools, he returned in 1930 to again win the Drake Relays and Kansas Relays plus added the Texas Relays for the trifecta of the top competitions in the country. Sacramento City College After graduating Weldon found work coaching at Sacramento City College from 1931 to 1945. He was elected into the school's Hall of Fame in 1997.http://wserver.scc.losrios.edu/~physed/forms/mediaguide05-06/halloffame.pdf His first notable coaching success was Jack Parker, a farm boy from Lamoni, Iowa who he recruited to Sacramento. In the summer of 1936, Weldon drove Parker to the decathlon Olympic Trials in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Parker finished in third place at the trials, qualifying him to participate in the 1936 Olympics. Against the best athletes in the world, the American team finished in the same order, with Parker taking the bronze medal. Other athletes coached by Weldon included: *Tom Moore, who later achieved the world record in the 120 yard high hurdles after transferring to the University of California, Berkeley. *Joe Batiste, who set the junior college record at Sacramento and won the national championship in the 120 yard high hurdles. Batiste qualified for both the 1940 and 1944 Olympic teams, but there were no Olympics due to World War II. With Batiste as a multi-event star, Sacramento won the National Junior College Championship in both 1941 and 1942. Eugene Register-Guard - May 31, 1942 *Lou Nova was a member of Weldon's 1933 track team, but the coach advised him his best sport might be boxing. Nova took that advice. He beat former title holder Max Baer twice, the first time was the first televised boxing match in 1939. He later fought Joe Louis for the title before retiring to become an actor. During World War II, Weldon took over the Sacramento football team which was undefeated in 1941 and 1942. The team suffered just one loss in 1943. Break In 1945, heart problems forced his retirement from coaching at Sacramento City College. For the next eight years he spent his time as a beekeeper and farm equipment salesman in Moorhead, Iowa. In 1953 he felt healthy enough to return to coaching at Amphitheater High School in Tucson, Arizona, the home town of his star athlete, Joe Batiste, while working on his master's degree at the University of Arizona. In 1959, Welton took a job as Athletic Director and track coach at one of his alma maters, Graceland University. While there his track teams dominated the Missouri College Athletic Union and later the Heart of America Athletic Conference, winning 11 conference titles in his 14 years at the school. Jenner The small school offered a $250 football scholarship to an athletic quarterback and water skiing champion from Connecticut named Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner). A knee injury in his first season required surgery on January 1, 1969. Like he did with Lou Nova, Weldon suggested Jenner might try a different athletic pursuit, this time the decathlon. He began to train Jenner, whose first competition in 1970 was the nearby Drake Relays where he placed fifth. A year later, Jenner was the NAIA Champion. The following year Jenner made the Olympic team by finishing third at the Olympic Trials representing Graceland.Richard Hymans (2008) The History of the United States Olympic trials ‚Äì Track and Field. USA Track and Field At the 1972 Olympics, the first event to start after the Munich massacre was the decathlon. Jenner watched as Mykola Avilov beat Bill Toomey's world record while he finished in tenth place. But Jenner was encouraged in defeat. After Jenner graduated from Graceland, Weldon took on an emeritus position with the college while Jenner moved to San Jose, California and began an intense training regimen while continuing to correspond with Weldon. By 1974, Jenner was the USA National Champion. By 1975 he had surpassed Avilov's world record. Jenner set another record while winning the Olympic trials, though that was muddled in a timing malfunction in other heats. Jenner settled the problem by setting a new world record while winning the gold medal at the 1976 Olympics. Jenner subsequently retired from athletics and went on to become an actor and celebrity.

It is only known from ten locations, four of which are on road verges. The species is classified as vulnerable. Description Calectasia pignattiana is a prickly, rhizomatous herb growing to a height of about 50 cm. Unlike some other members of the genus (such as C. grandiflora) this species lacks a rhizome but has stilt roots 10-60 mm long. The stems are up to 60 cm long and slender, with many lateral branches, occasionally with adventitious stilt roots up to 150 mm long protruding from the upper branches. The leaves are 5.2-11.5 x 0.9-1.4 mm and glabrous. The six petals are dark blue, gradually fading to white with age and the central anthers are yellow, turning orange- red with age. Flowers appear from June to September. Taxonomy and naming Calectasia pignattiana is one of eleven species in the genus Calectasia. It was described as a new species in 2001 by R.L.Barrett & K.W.Dixon from a specimen collected near Quairading. The specific epithet (pignattiana) \\"honours Professors Erika and Alessandro Pignatti of Rome on the occasion of their seventieth birthdays. They have contributed greatly to our knowledge of south-west vegetation associations and have collected extensively, including many taxa new to science\\". Distribution and habitat The stilted tinsel lily is considered vulnerable because four of the ten locations where it has been found are on road verges, one population is in danger from frequent fire events, another is thought to have been cleared, one site has only one plant, other two plants. It grows in yellow sand lenses, in kwongan dominated by Proteaceae - a relatively restricted soil type. Conservation status Calectasia pignattiana is classified as vulnerable by the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Water Resources and the Department of the Environment, Canberra. It is vulnerable to, and threatened by the European rabbit.

Founded in 1990, it owns and operates 14 residential buildings and collaborates with other organizations in its goals. Purpose The organization offers housing, job training, case management, community organizing, resident engagement and other support services to the formerly homeless. It began \\"with the idea that many homeless people suffer posttraumatic stress disorder and that this cycle wouldn't be broken unless they have a longer-term supportive community to live in.\\" Since Community Housing Partnership was founded in 1990, more than a thousand housing units have been provided to help over 2,200 people. It is one of the city's \\"largest supportive-housing providers,\\" and it provides specialized services for people with disabilities and mental-health or substance-abuse challenges.Joshua Sabatini, \\"SF Turns Focus to Supportive Housing in Efforts to Combat Homelessness,\\" San Francisco Examiner, February 25, 2014 History Community Housing Partnership sprang from the destruction wreaked upon San Francisco by the massive Loma Prieta earthquake of October 1989, which damaged or destroyed scores of buildings and left some twelve thousand people homeless. \\"Almost all of the homeless shelters I worked with had to empty out because they were in bad shape,\\" recalled Paul Boden, organizing director of the Western Regional Advocacy Project. In the earthquake aftermath, some financial support became available for property owners and renters with long-term leases, but no help was forthcoming for the homeless and low-income residents. A Navy aircraft carrier entered San Francisco Bay to provide some shelter for the homeless, Boden said. Boden and fellow board members of the Coalition on Homelessness Joe Wilson, Greg Francis and Laura Ware had earlier written a proposal for San Francisco to build permanent housing for the homeless \\"instead of just temporary shelters.\\" San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos allocated some $2.2 million from the city's earthquake relief fund to put the proposal into action. A year later, Community Housing Partnership was opened. In 2014 it had a staff of more than 280, \\"many of whom have experienced homelessness first-hand.\\" It had an annual operating budget of about $25 million. Projects Community Housing Partnership owns and operates the first new residential building in the San Francisco Transbay development area south of Mission Street, the Rene Cazenave Apartments, which has 120 units of supportive housing for the \\"chronically homeless.\\" The eight-story, $42.7 million building was designed by Leddy Maytum Stacy Architects, which joined not only with Community Housing Partnership but also with Bridge Housing in the development. Architectural Record noted that \\"the building‚Äôs first-floor plan encourages residents to take advantage of support services such as substance abuse counseling and psychotherapy, placing them prominently along the primary circulation corridor. This internal ‚ÄúMain Street‚Äù is wide and daylit through 7.5-foot- diameter skylights.\\" The magazine quoted architect Richard Stacy as saying: ‚ÄúWe wanted to get away from the idea that there was any stigma attached to using these services.‚ÄùLydia Lee, \\"Rene Cazenave Apartments,\\" Architectural Record, June 2014 > The units are modestly sized‚Äîmost are 320-foot studios‚Äîbut pleasantly > bright, with floor-to-ceiling windows.

In 2014 Community Housing Partnership, with its thousand units of \\"supportive housing,\\" began working on a plan to \\"free up\\" at least 100 units each year by moving residents out of them into \\"below-market-rate housing, public housing or market-rate\\" rentals, thus making room for new tenants to begin a climb up a \\"housing ladder,\\" said Executive Director Gail Gilman. In the same year, Community Housing Partnership was a collaborator with the city, Larkin Street Youth Services and neighborhood groups in the transformation of the Edward II Inn from a 1914-era tourist hotel into a 24-unit supportive-housing site for \\"transitional-age youths\\" aged 18 to 24, with residents paying 30 percent of their adjusted income as rent.

Background Emperor Manuel's cousin, Andronikos Komnenos, who administered Belgrade, Braniƒçevo, and Ni≈° sent a letter to G√©za II in 1154, offering to hand over those towns to him in exchange for his support against the emperor. G√©za II sent his envoys to Sicily to sign a new alliance with William I of Sicily around the end of the year, but William I was fighting with his rebellious subjects. Siege Although Andronikos' plot was discovered and he was captured, G√©za II invaded the Byzantine Empire and laid siege to in late 1154. G√©za II was aided by Cumans, who had been raiding the Danube at the time. As a Hungarian vassal, Boriƒá, the ban of Bosnia took part in the attack, alongside a Bohemian detachment. Braniƒçevo was besieged and the surroundings were ravaged. After hearing of the imprisonment of Andronikos, G√©za II abandoned the siege and returned for Hungary. Aftermath Manuel answered by dispatching troops towards the battlefield. Through Serdica (Sofia) and Ni≈°, Manuel arrived in the Smilis province near Paraƒáin where he set up camp. The Hungarian Army retreated towards Belgrade. The pursuing Byzantine troops, under general Basil Tzintzilukes, entered into battle with them, but the Byzantines were annihilated before the Hungarians returned to Hungary. In early 1155, the Byzantine and Hungarian envoys signed a new peace treaty. In the same year, a Byzantine army expelled G√©za II's ally, Desa, from Serbia and restored Uro≈° II who had promised that he would not enter into an alliance with Hungary.

Arshack has conducted training for lawyers in Paris, Beirut, the Hague, Victoria, Montreal, Liberia, and New York. His specialties are trial advocacy techniques, ethics, and international criminal tribunals. He has also been an adjunct professor of trial advocacy at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. Early life and education Arshack was born in Detroit on March 30, 1956, and lived there until 1959. His parents divorced and his mother raised him and his sister Susan in Ann Arbor until she moved the family to the Washington, D.C. area in 1966. Arshack attended Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, where he played on the varsity soccer team and was president of Stage Crew. He supervised designing and building the sets for Oliver and Lil ‚ÄòAbner. Arshack studied at Brandeis University, where he first majored in technical theater and studied theatre set design in Sweden at the University of Stockholm, though ultimately majored in Sociology.American Civil Liberties Union, Bios of FAA Challenge Plaintiffs His first job out of college was as a field researcher for the Environmental Protection Agency on a national rural water quality assessment study. He was assigned a portion of northeastern Pennsylvania and was responsible for interviewing rural households about their water and took samples of water for testing.Environmental Protection Agency, National Statistical Assessment of Rural Water Conditions, 1978. He then worked from 1978 to 1980 as research analyst for Abt Associates, a social science think tank in Cambridge, MA. He worked on studies designed to understand methods of improving the workflow though welfare offices, compared the outcomes of child day care programs in relation to their funding models and addressed juvenile justice issues. Arshack then attended Antioch School of Law in Washington D.C., from which he graduated in 1983. In 1994, he completed post-graduate work in Medical Bio-Ethics and the Humanities at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and Einstein School of Medicine.Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute, \\"Lawyers: Daniel N. Arshack\\" Early Law Career After receiving his law degree from Antioch, Arshack worked at private firms in Washington D.C. and Philadelphia from 1983 to 1987. His scope of practice included administrative hearings in securities fraud litigation, criminal trials including conspiracy, drug sales, interstate prostitution, homicide, passport fraud, and bank teller fraud; he also handled complex product liability work business loss, contracts, civil rights, and federal tort claims. As a result of one of his first cases, involving the rape of a young boy while in pre-trial detention in Washington, D.C., which successfully challenged the conditions of confinement for juveniles in Washington, D.C., Arshack had the opportunity to assist in the drafting of the Child Protection Act of 1984, which protected vulnerable children from being housed in cells with older, more violent arrestees.See page 60 of the following document: \\"Children In State Care: Ensuring Their Protection and Support\\" From 1987 to 1991, Arshack worked as a trial attorney at the Legal Aid Society in New York City, where he represented thousands of clients and participated in training new lawyers. During this time, he successfully challenged the length of time individuals could be confined pending indictment. While still a young Legal Aid lawyer, Arshack was featured in the 1990 Ted Koppel documentary news report that followed a drug trial from beginning to end. At the conclusion of the case after his client was convicted, Arshack answered in response to Koppel asking if he thought his client got a fair trial: \\"Well, I believe there should have been a level playing field. In this case there were two prosecutors in the room. One sat at the table next to me and the other was wearing a black robe\\" (referring to then New York State Supreme Court Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder). From 1991 to 1996, Arshack again worked in a private practice, which emphasized criminal defense in state and federal courts. Bronx Defenders In 1996, Arshack, under contract to the City of New York, built a new public defender‚Äôs office in The Bronx known as The Bronx Defenders, now a nationally recognized office. His team of lawyers and support staff handled around 13,000 cases per year. While with the Bronx Defenders, Arshack implemented a program to train attorneys from Latin America to set up public defender programs in their countries. Managing Partner In 1999, Arshack, along with David Hoffman, formed Arshack & Hoffman, P.C., in Manhattan. The firm specialized in criminal defense and the defense of medical malpractice cases. When Hoffman left the firm to become General Counsel at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in 2003, Arshack formed Arshack, Hajek, and Lehrman, PLLC, which provides criminal defense to businesses and individuals, medical malpractice defense to physicians and hospitals, and counsel to businesses in complex commercial litigation; the firm works throughout the United States and internationally. Arshack‚Äôs partners are Lynn Hajek, who specializes in representing hospitals and physicians in medical malpractice cases, and Michael Lehrman, who heads the trial defense division of the firm‚Äôs medical malpractice group.Arshack, Hajek and Lehrman, PLLC, Lynn Hajek and Michael Lehrman Major Cases =Nieves v. Home Box Office, Inc.= In 2006, Arshack successfully represented actress and singer Chanti Nieves‚Äôs privacy interests, when she was surreptitiously videotaped by HBO‚Äôs reality show Family Bonds as she stood on a street corner in Manhattan. Members of the cast made \\"crude remarks\\" about the effect Nieves‚Äôs appearance had on their genitals, and she sought damages. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Debra A. James ruled in Ms. Nieves's favor that Family Bonds would have had to show a \\"real relationship\\" between the show‚Äôs subject matter and the bystander‚Äôs image to avoid liability in an invasion of privacy case.Andrew Nieh, \\"Nieves v. Home Box Office, Inc.\\" New York Law School Law Review 54 (2009/10) =Upholding secrecy in Rosenberg Testimony= In 2008 and 2015, Arshack represented David Greenglass, the brother of Ethel Rosenberg, who was a key government witness in the case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. A group of historians sought to uncover Greenglass‚Äôs secret grand jury testimony, which led to the conviction and subsequent execution of the Rosenbergs; letters Arshack wrote on his client‚Äôs behalf convinced a federal judge in the July 2008 decision not to unseal Greenglass‚Äôs testimony.Benjamin Weiser, \\"U.S. Judge Upholds Secrecy of Rosenberg Testimony\\", New York Times (Jul 23, 2008). Arshack, representing the estate of David Greenglass and his family, continued to resist the release of that grand jury testimony in 2015 after Mr. Greenglass‚Äôs death. =New York vs. Alain Robert= In 2008, Arshack represented \\"French Spiderman\\" Alain Robert, who was charged with reckless endangerment, among other charges. Robert claimed to have climbed The New York Times Building to raise awareness about global warming.John Eligon, Most Charges Dropped in Building Climb, New York Times (Jun 13, 2008) After hearing Robert‚Äôs testimony, a grand jury decided to reduce his felony charges to minor non-criminal violations; Robert was sentenced to three days of community service, which he completed at the nonprofit organization Gay Men‚Äôs Health Crisis.John Eligon, Times Building Climber is Sentenced to Three Days of Community Service, New York Times (Dec 1, 2008) =Defense of former Qaddafi official= In 2011, Arshack provided the United States defense of the highest-ranking former official of Libya‚Äôs Qaddafi regime to defect from Libya at the inception of the Arab Spring. The defense, during a prolonged multi-pronged investigation of the official, required interaction with the FBI, UK Investigators, Scottish Police and SEC investigators, who sought information concerning events in which Libya was suspected of being involved ranging from the mid-1980s to 2010. Prolonged negotiations in Doha, Qatar, with various law enforcement agencies from different countries resulted in no charges being filed.Arshack, Hajek and Lehrman, Daniel Arshack and Practice Areas: International Crimes =The People of the State of Colorado vs. James Holmes= In 2013, Arshack was asked to join the legal team of the Aurora, CO \\"Dark Knight\\" movie theater shooter James Eagan Holmes, in an attempt to compel the Fox News reporter Jana Winter to appear before a judge in Colorado. Winter refused to reveal confidential sources, members of Colorado law enforcement, who had violated a Colorado judge‚Äôs gag order by sharing the contents of Holmes‚Äôs notebooks with her. Holmes faced the death penalty, but was convicted and sentenced to 12 life terms for 12 murders, plus 3,318 years for attempted murder. Arshack won at both the trial and appellate levels, but the highest court in New York ruled against Holmes.Leslie Kaufman, \\"New York Court Won‚Äôt Order Fox Reporter to Testify, Shoring Up State Shield Law\\", New York Times (Dec 10,2013). Arshack appealed to the United States Supreme Court, who declined to hear the case.Arshack, Hajek and Lehrman, \\"Aurora shooter‚Äôs lawyers take Fox News subpoena fight to Supreme Court\\" =Created novel process for clearing individual maligned in a United Nations report= In 2014, Arshack represented the single largest taxpayer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), who had been identified in a very public United Nations report prepared by UN area \\"experts\\" as a funder and supporter of rebel groups in that country. The individual denied the allegations and sought legal counsel to generate the evidence that the allegations were false and then convince the UN to retract the allegations made in the report, as these allegations had taken a severe toll on his business interests throughout the DRC and elsewhere in Africa and Europe. As a result of Arshack‚Äôs representation, the UN took the completely unprecedented step of agreeing to retract all of the damaging statements made against this individual; moreover, Arshack‚Äôs team addressed the lack of process within the UN structure to address allegations such as those made in these UN reports.Daniel N. Arshack: Creativity, Tenacity and Aggressive Criminal Defense Yield Success, New York Magazine (Dec 31, 2014)Arshack, Hajek and Lehrman, International criminal defense =United States vs. Devyani Khobragade= In 2013, Arshack represented Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, then the Deputy Consul General in New York, who was arrested on charges of illegally obtaining a work visa for her children‚Äôs nanny and paying her far less than the minimum wage.Benjamin Weiser and Gardiner Harris, Fury in India over Diplomat‚Äôs Arrest in New York, New York Times (Dec 19, 2013).

Ultimately all charges against Khobragade were dismissed.Dominique Debucquoy- Dodley, Charges against Indian diplomat who was strip searched dismissed, CNN (Mar 13, 2014). =United States vs. Chetan Kapur= In 2013, Arshack defended Chetan Kapur, manager of the New York-based hedge fund Think Strategy, who had been the subject of a prolonged SEC investigation. Kapur faced charges of security fraud, investor advisor fraud, and wire fraud, and faced up to 125 years in prison.Christie Smythe, ThinkStrategy‚Äôs Kapur Gets Time Served in Hedge Fund Case, BloombergBusiness (Oct 28, 2013). In a deal with prosecutors, Kapur pleaded guilty to a felony (one count of failure to preserve books and records), was sentenced to time served (one year), and the prosecutors dismissed fraud charges.PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records), 1:12-cr-00535-JFK .Stewart Bishop, Hedge Fund Manager Walks After Fraud Charges Dropped, Law360 (Aug 21, 2013). =Kenyan nationals facing extradition and drug trafficking charges= In 2014, Arshack was hired to consult in Mombasa, Kenya as Learned Counsel in the fight against the United States‚Äô effort to extradite an associate of the two sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha from Kenya to the US to face drug trafficking charges.Willis Oketch, Akasha sons now hire US lawyer, The Counties (Dec 16, 2014)\\"Akasha sons contest appeal\\" =Defense of Waleed Abulkhair= In 2015, Arshack joined the defense team of Saudi Arabian lawyer and human rights activist Waleed Abulkhair. In 2015, he traveled to Geneva in order to accept the Ludovic Trarieux International Human Rights Prize on behalf of his client, who remains imprisoned. =Anne O‚ÄôHare Bynum vs. State of Arkansas= In 2018, Arshack served as consulting attorney for National Advocates for Pregnant Women, which represented Anne Bynum‚Äôs appeal against the state of Arkansas. Bynum, who had hid her pregnancy from her family, had a stillbirth in her home and was subsequently arrested for concealing a birth. She was initially sentenced to 6 years; Arshack argued and won her appeal.http://arkansas- sc.granicus.com/player/clip/1065?view_id=5 The court reversed the conviction and the prosecutor chose not to re-try her.‚ÄúArkansas Court of Appeals Overturns Criminal Conviction for Concealing a Birth‚Äù Press Arshack has appeared, in relation to his cases, as a commentator on The Today Show, Nightline with Ted Koppel (1990),\\"Koppel Report: Drugs, Crime and Doing Time\\" (September 5, 1990)The Queen Latifah Show, CBS, NBC and ABC News, Court TV, the BBC, and Al Jazeera.

Types The coat hair of the yak is composed of three different types of fiber that vary greatly in appearance and characteristics. The quantity of fiber produced by one yak is dependent on factors such as sex, age and breed of the yak, and the proportions of the different layers vary throughout the different seasons. *The coarse: Mostly used by nomads in tent making, this fiber has a size range of 79‚Äì90 microns forming the outer coat of long hair that characterizes the appearance of the yak. *The mid-type: With a diameter size between 20‚Äì50 microns, this fiber is naturally strong but not stronger than the outer layers to make ropes and tents and not as fine as the down fiber for the textile industry. *The down fiber: This is the finest fiber (16‚Äì20 microns) and is generally shed by the animal during late spring/early summer period. Therefore, this fine layer needs to be harvested before it is shed in the summer season. Down fiber, and fewer sweat glands, are two examples of how yaks have adapted to survive extreme cold temperatures (sometimes as low as ‚àí50 ¬∞C, or ‚àí58 ¬∞F) and altitudes well above 3000 m. Properties Yak wool has similar properties to other animal fibers, including breathability and static-resistance, but has been proven to outperform sheep wool in a number of areas. Warmth: In woollen garments, air pockets are created between the fibers that reduce the rate of heat transfer. This property combined with lanolin (a hydrophobic grease present in wool fibers) allowing wool to keep you warm when wet. Yak wool is rich in myristic acid, a type of hydrophobic fatty acid. Independently conducted tests on yak down suggest that it is warmer than Merino wool. Nonetheless, claims vary on how much warmer it is with values ranging between 10 and 40 per cent. Softness: Cashmere is known in the textile industry as one of the softest wools with a fiber diameter of less than 18.5. The diameter of the down fiber of the yak also ranges 16‚Äì20 microns making its softness comparable to that of cashmere. Species-specific DNA probes have been developed to identify yak, which is used to quantitatively test yak-cashmere blends. Although cashmere has already been firmly established in the market, yak wool has potential to be sold as a luxury product due to its softness and the (currently) sustainable and eco-friendly means used for gathering the fibers. Breathability: In general, wool's comfort comes from its thermo- balance characteristics. The breathability factor of a material depends on its ability to absorb moisture relative to its weight and then release it into the air. The higher the absorption value the better the textile is at adapting to humidity level changes. Wool can absorb over 30 per cent of moisture, greater than cotton (25 per cent) and far greater than polyester which can absorb only 1 per cent of its weight. Odor-resistance: Contrary to popular belief, yaks do not have a strong odor. Unless combined with the bacteria that live on the skin, sweat is odorless. The anti-microbial properties of yak fibers prevent bacteria from living on sweat thereby considerably reducing odor. Uses =Traditional= The coarse outer fibers have been traditionally used by nomads to make ropes and tents. In earlier times, the coarse hair was mixed with down hair to make the weaving denser. However, the current increasing demand for the down fiber from the international market means that the fine fiber is mostly sold. The rarity of the white hair implicates that ropes made out of white and black Yarn is admired for its appearance and uniqueness. In west Sichuan, China, 34 per cent of the animal fiber comes from yak hair alone. In Bhutan, the long hair is used for weaving tents, bags, rugs and slings, whereas in Mongolia it is used for clothing tents and bags. To obtain the optimal length, nomads comb the hair and then spin it into yarn. During this process, the loom determines the width of the tent squares and the length of the tent. The tent squares are then sewn tightly together by men. =Fashion= Since the mid-20th century, experiments on the material have been carried out encouraging the interest of the garment industry in yak wool, where its exotic nature and favorable performance characteristics make it an attractive alternative to cashmere. The head of design of Lyle and Scott considers yak and other wools to be \\"natural and incredibly flexible, more than any technical yarns\\". The first brand to bring high quality yak wool khullu to the luxury market was the social enterprise Norlha Textiles in 2007. In 2017 Norlha Textiles employs over 100 local Tibetan nomads and trains them as artisans. In 2012, the famous French luxury brand Louis Vuitton introduced yak wool to their home and d√©cor collection, presenting a cape-cum-neck cushion made out of that fiber. Two years earlier, the British heritage brand, Dunhill introduced their \\"Trans-Siberian Express'‚Äô winter-themed collection that included merino-yak blended items. Outdoor clothing companies such as Peak to Plateau have recently started using yak wool due to its warmth and breathability. Also British company, kora, launched in 2013 has developed 100 per cent yak wool products for their outdoor line using ethically sourced wool. They also claimed to have made the world's first mid-layer jacket from yak wool. =Architecture= Although uncommon, yak wool has also been employed as sound proof material by the Dutch artist Claudy Jongstra in the refurbishment of Rem Koolhaas' Kunsthal in Rotterdam, a building that gets 300,000 visitors a year. She made a thick, dense yak hair felt with a graphic design of white lines.

For some reason, the year 1940 is used when the film was released six years earlier. Plot Krazy is a dance instructor who is teaching moves to a quartet of clowns wearing leotards and high-heeled pumps. When the clowns are having trouble following his instructions, Krazy puts ropes on their legs to show them how to move. Momentarily, a Swedish girl with a blond spiral hair comes out of a dance school only a few yards away before entering Krazy's studio. The Swedish girl comes to Krazy, and shows him her dance skills. Krazy, however, isn't interested and therefore turns her down as he is expecting a famous soprano to arrive. The Swedish girl then shows her singing skills by letting out a high tone that jolts Krazy off his feet. But Krazy still turns her down. The Swedish girl then demonstrates her acting skills as she goes into a movable balcony, and recites some romantic poems. To keep her away, Krazy raises and sets the balcony to the peak. The Swedish girl screams in horror upon seeing no way down. A fancy car arrives just outside the studio minutes later. Exiting the vehicle is the soprano whom Krazy was waiting for. The soprano comes to Krazy, and sings a few notes for demonstration. The Swedish girl, who is still up on the movable balcony, applauds the soprano's test act. The Swedish girl is also leaning forward too much before falling off the platform and onto the soprano. The soprano is deformed as a result, and even has a distorted voice. The soprano leaves the scene embarrassed. Krazy has no choice but to pick the Swedish girl for the show. Later that night, the scene shows the outside of the theater with a banner of the event called \\"The Katnips of 1940.\\" The name of the soprano on the banner is also shown being replaced by that of the Swedish girl. The event is started by a group of singing can can dancers. Next it is the turn of the Swedish girl to take center stage. The Swedish girl, wearing a fedora, is at first too hesitant to step into the limelight but thankfully Krazy literally gives her a push. The Swedish girl sings, dances, and plays castanets on the stage with complete fluency. Krazy, also wearing a fedora, joins her on stage seconds afterward. With three flawless performances, both of them receive applause. After the lights move away from them and back, Krazy and the Swedish girl are seen dressed like Uncle Sam and the Statue of Liberty respectively.

He lives in Port Lincoln, South Australia and is the chief executive for the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association (formerly known as the Tuna Boat Owners Association). He is a current member of the Australian Maritime and Fisheries Academy, the Commonwealth Fisheries Association, the Aquaculture Advisory Committee and the Fisheries and Aquaculture Research Advisory Committee. Jeffriess features regularly in the Port Lincoln Times newspaper, where he relates the industry's activities and interests to his local community. He attends the international Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna meetings and works closely with industry and government. On 26 January 2012 Jeffriess was awarded Member of the Order of Australia \\"for service to the fishing and aquaculture industries as a contributor to the sustainable management and harvesting of Australian fisheries and through national and international professional associations.\\" He has also been awarded State and National Seafood Icon status.  Career  Jeffriess has been industry spokesperson for tuna aquaculture in South Australia since it began in 1993. In 2001 he spoke of the Japanese desire to \\"supply the Japanese consumer at a reasonable price with high-quality sashimi.\\" Japan's Overseas Fishery Cooperation Foundation sent two operatives to Port Lincoln to help establish the industry. Since that time the industry has captured young fish in the wild and transferred them to pens in Boston Bay and Spencer Gulf where they are fattened up for market. They are then harvested, chilled and exported to Japan by plane. The same year, Jefferiess expressed concern that his town of Port Lincoln would suffer if the industry collapsed, saying \\"I find this scary. I wake up every morning and think 'How do you sustain this?\\"' Jeffriess is a former chairman of the National Fishing Industry Council and Australian Seafood Industry Council and represents the tuna industry in the Spencer Gulf Ecosystem and Development Initiative which was initiated by the Environment Institute at the University of Adelaide. Jeffriess has served on a variety of high level committees including the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (2001-2008), many fishery commissions, the FRDC Board, various subprograms and import/export committees. He has extensive fisheries and aquaculture experience spanning across industries from Australia's cold temperate ocean to the tropical north. Jefferiess has an economics degree and professional experience in business management and as chief political advisor.  Politics  Jeffriess has expressed his opinions to the media on a range of marine matters relevant to the southern blue fin tuna industry, aquaculture sector and fisheries management. = Tuna fishing = As of 2015, Jeffriess believes that the southern blue fin tuna stocks are being adequately managed, and welcomed increases to the Australian catch quota in 2014 and 2015 seasons. He has acknowledged that concerns expressed by others regarding the viability of the stock circa 2010 were valid. = Great white sharks = In 1995, Jeffriess told The Australian that \\"due to the biology of this species, a sustainable fishery for the Great White is not possible.\\" He was speaking as chairman of the Australian Seafood Industry Council at the time, and pressure was increasing to provide legislative protection to the species. As of 2015, Jeffriess maintains a moderate attitude in public towards great white sharks. In response to a CSIRO publication he expressed his belief in a civic responsibility \\"to inform the community in a scientific and rational way on numbers of whites and other sharks ‚Äì and let the community make up their own minds on risks.\\" = New Zealand fur seals = Jeffriess has supported the need to research and manage New Zealand fur seal populations in South Australia and has described them as a major problem for tuna ranchers. > \\"They are the largest cause of tuna deaths in the pontoons and (they) > frighten the other tuna so they do not eat for days.\\" = Supertrawler FV Margiris = Mr Jeffriess told the media that the tuna industry association's view was that bigger boats (like the FV Margiris) catching the quota of small pelagic fish quicker would cause less environmental impact than a large number of smaller boats fishing for longer, closer to shore. Jeffriess said there were already much bigger boats in Australian waters including trawl boats that stayed at sea longer than the Margiris and with much bigger nets. He said the issue for Port Lincoln was to ensure that the FV Margiris didn't interact with the sardine fishery and an agreement had been reached. On the decision to temporarily ban the FV Margiris from Australian waters, Jeffriess commented: > \\"The minister had the right to make a political decision, and that is what > he did.\\" Jeffriess' support for the supertrawler FV Margiris attracted commentary by animal rights organisation, Animals Australia. The organisation drew attention to the industry's dependency on small pelagic fish to feed the tuna and pointed to its potential to impact other species such as the little penguin.

Burling (April 24, 1819, Newburgh, New York ‚Äì February 1892) was an American architect who designed buildings in Chicago in the 1840s through the 1890s.  Personal life  Edward J. Burling was born April 24, 1819, to Nathaniel Burling (1778-1828) and Elizabeth (maiden name unknown) Burling (1798-1886) in Newburgh, New York, a town located along the Hudson River between New York City and Albany, New York. He was never formally trained nor completed his education, but began a carpentry apprenticeship as a teenager, heading up the design and construction of a few homes after having experience. In 1843, Burling moved from Newburgh, New York to Chicago to start his career in Architecture. Burling was married to Eliza Burling and had six children together. He died in February 1892.  Architecture  Higinbotham Country Club designed by Burling, . Burling‚Äôs first project was in 1845. He was hired to build a Greek Revival home for Eli B. Williams, one of Chicago‚Äôs earliest settlers and real estate developers. Burling's career first took off after this project: designing churches, government buildings, and grand homes. Real Estate mogul William B. Ogden, who was Chicago‚Äôs first mayor in 1837, hired Burling to work for his firm, Ogden, Jones & Co., as general superintendent. Burling eventually split from Ogden's firm, forming a partnership with Frederick H. Baumann in 1852 and creating the firm Edward Burling & Co. in 1855. One record shows that Burling had, at one point, construction moving forward on one church, one residence, one public building, three hotels, and twelve commercial buildings. Burling had many architectural works during these early years. Unfortunately for Burling‚Äôs architectural legacy, nearly all of his early work was consumed by the Great Fire in 1871. The fire practically wiped Chicago‚Äôs slate clean. Despite his work getting destroyed, his Tribune Building‚Äîthe first supposedly fireproof building in the city‚Äîsaw its iron beams melt into liquid rivers in the blasting heat, and its stone baked and crumbled to dust. Still, a stone-walled survivor of Burling‚Äôs early work stands next to the Driehaus Museum today: St. James Cathedral, which he built in 1857 and rebuilt in 1875. Later in Burlings career, he created a firm with architect Dankmar Adler. They reconstructed four miles‚Äô worth of streetscape in the single year after the fire, more than 100 buildings created in all. Some were rebuilds, including the second Tribune Building and Marine Bank Building‚Äîwhile others were new, important commissions, including the Chicago Post Office and Customs House and Methodist Church Block, a religious denomination with which Burling was affiliated.

The short title of the initiative was Legalization of Possession of Minimal Amounts of Marijuana for Personal Use Act of 2014. The measure was approved by 64.87% of voters on November 4, 2014 and went into full effect on February 26, 2015.  Creation  In 2010, DC-based headshop Capitol Hemp was one of the largest contributors to the failed Proposition 19, which would have legalized cannabis in California. The following year Capitol Hemp was raided by the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department for allegedly selling paraphernalia. As required in a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. Attorneys, owners Adam Eidinger and Alan Amsterdam were forced to shut down the stores in September 2012 and decided to start the process to change the law. In early 2013, local activists Adam Eidinger, Nikolas Schiller, and Alan Amsterdam formed a skeleton organization \\"DCMJ\\" to advocate decriminalization of marijuana in the District. After seeing no movement from the Council of the District of Columbia, Eidinger submitted initial paperwork for a decriminalization ballot initiative, which was rejected by the Board of Election in September 2013 on technical budgetary grounds. The following month DCMJ solicited online feedback and resubmitted a second version, now strengthened to call for full legalization of marijuana. In an interview with the Washington Post, Eidinger attributed his inspiration to legalize marijuana to his experiences in the 2011 police raids on his Capitol Hemp retail store, which was forced into closure by the city. On January 10, 2014, the DC Cannabis Campaign submitted the final version of the ballot initiative to the District of Columbia Board of Elections. Hearings were held in February and March, and on April 4, 2014, the board finalized the ballot initiative language.  Petition gathering  The campaign collected petition signatures from April 23 until the July 7 deadline, ultimately submitting over 55,000 signatures; the District certified 27,688 of the signatures as valid, exceeding the 22,600 requirement.  Intervening decriminalization  While the campaign was preparing its ballot initiative, on March 4, 2014, the Council of the District of Columbia decriminalized possession of cannabis, which went into effect in July following the mandatory 30-day congressional review period. Medical cannabis had already been legalized in the District by Initiative 59 in 1998, but its implementation was blocked by Congress until 2009, with the first legal sales occurring in 2013.  Election  Throughout 2014, the DC Cannabis Campaign advocated for passage of the measure, while groups such as Two Is Enough D.C. formed to oppose the measure. The measure was approved by 64.87% of voters on November 4, 2014. Almost immediately following, Republicans in Congress, and Maryland Representative Andy Harris in particular, vowed to block legalization of cannabis in D.C. The ballot results were certified on December 3, 2014. Source: DC Board of Elections  Opposition in Congress  In mid-December 2014, Congress passed an omnibus spending bill (nicknamed the \\"CRomnibus\\"--a portmanteau of omnibus and continuing resolution) that ended the federal ban on medical marijuana, but that also included a legislative rider targeted at D.C.'s Initiative 71. The rider's final language barred the use of funds to \\"enact any law, rule, or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution of any schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) or any tetrahydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes.\\" The final language notably solely used the phrase \\"enact\\" rather than \\"enact or carry out.\\" Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said that \\"she was told by Democratic budget negotiators that the omission was made on purpose to give city leaders a chance to argue that in moving forward, the District is only carrying out, and not enacting, the measure.\\" Norton reiterated this point in an Initiative 71 questions and answers section on her House Web site. Both D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and the Council of the District of Columbia took the position that the voter-approved initiative became self-enacting. On January 13, 2015, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson sent the measure to Congress for a mandatory 30-day review period, in accordance with the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. On February 24, 2015, Representatives Jason Chaffetz and Mark Meadows sent a letter to Bowser urging her to not move forward with Initiative 71. Congressional Republicans, including the omnibus rider author's Andy Harris, threatened prison time for the D.C. mayor and others involved, suggesting that they could be prosecuted by the Justice Department under the Anti-Deficiency Act, which \\"imposes criminal penalties on government employees who knowingly spend public funds in excess of their appropriated budgets.\\" Completion This congressional review period ended at 12:01 a.m. on February 26, 2015, making D.C. the \\"only place east of the Mississippi River where people can legally grow and share marijuana in private.\\" D.C. \\"allows adults 21 and older to possess up to two ounces of marijuana, grow up to six plants, and gift up to one ounce of pot to other adults 21 and older, but sales remain banned\\", as Washington, D.C.'s ballot initiative process does not allow spending mandates such as commercialization would require.

The vast majority of conversos remained in Spain and Portugal, and their descendants in both these countries numbering in the millions. The small minority of conversos who did emigrate normally chose destinations where Sephardic communities already existed, particularly in the Ottoman Empire and North Africa, but also more tolerant cities in Europe, where they immediately reverted to Judaism. Although a few travelled to Latin America with colonial expeditions, doing so was particularly difficult, since only those Spaniards who could certify no recent Muslim or Jewish ancestry were allowed to travel to the New World. But the constant flow of Spanish emigration to Latin America until well into the 20th century resulted in many Latin Americans having Converso ancestry, in the same way as modern Spaniards do. The Bnei Anusim concept has gained some popularity among the Hispanic community in the American South West and in countries in Latin America. Thousands of Hispanics have expressed a belief that they are descendants of such conversos and many have expressed a desire to return to Judaism. Such desire may perhaps be understood within the complex identity politics of both Latin and Anglo-America and their interplay with social mobility. Belief in converso identity is normally based on memories of family practices which may resemble perceptions or understandings of Jewish customs and religion. In addition, some have conducted internet genealogical research and have studied publicly available population genetics and atDNA analysis, leading them to their conclusions. Since the early 21st century, a growing number \\"of [Sephardic] Benei Anusim have been established in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and in Sefarad (Iberia) itself\\" as \\"organized groups.\\" Some members of these communities have formally reverted to Judaism, and they have become functional communities of public Judaizers. Although reversion to Judaism among these communities is largely a question of individual belief and interest, and any knowledge of Jewish ancestry has generally been long lost over the past four centuries, two specific exceptions exist: The Xueta community of the island of Majorca in Spain and the Marrano community of Belmonte in Portugal. Both communities have practiced endogamy over generations, thus maintaining awareness of their Jewish heritage. In the case of the Xueta, they also suffered social stigma and discrimination well into the 20th century for their converso origin. The Jewish Agency for Israel estimates the Sephardic Bnei Anusim population to number in the millions. Although they are the least prominent of Sephardic descendants, Sephardic Bnei Anusim outnumber their Jewish-integrated Sephardic Jewish counterparts, which consist of Eastern Sephardim, North African Sephardim, and the ex-converso Western Sephardim. With up to 20% of Spain and Portugal's population and at least 10% of Latin America's Iberian-descended population estimated to have at least some Sephardic Jewish ancestry (90% of Latin America's modern population having at least partial Iberian ancestry, in the form of criollos, mestizos, and mulattos), the total population size of Sephardic Bnei Anusim (67.78 million) is not only several times larger than the combined population of Jewish-integrated Sephardic sub-groups, but also more than four times the size of the total world Jewish population as a whole. The latter encompasses Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahi Jews and various other smaller groups.  Status  = Halakha = Under Jewish religious law, also known as halakha, the Jewish status of Sephardic Bnei Anusim as a collective group is not automatically recognized by most religious authorities, for two reasons. Firstly, because of issues regarding generational distance, and secondly, because of issues relating to proving an unbroken direct maternal Jewish lineage, which is required for Orthodox recognition. In regards to the first issue, many generations have passed since the coerced conversions of the anusim forebears of the Sephardic Bnei Anusim. Depending on Jewish legal rulings being followed, the maximum generational distance for acceptance as Jews (without the requirement of formal reversion/conversion) is between 3 and 5 generations from the anusim forebear/s who was/were forced to convert from Judaism to Catholicism. In regards to the second issue, in Rabbinic Judaism, a person's Jewish status is determined in one of two ways: * a Jew by conversion, if he/she has personally gone through a formal conversion to Judaism, or * a natural-born Jew, if he/she was born from an unbroken direct maternal Jewish lineage which is ** a Jewish lineage ab initio (\\"from the beginning\\", from time immemorial descending from an Israelite-era Hebrew woman), or ** a Jewish lineage established by a female ancestor's formal conversion to Judaism whose unbroken direct Jewish maternal lineage descendants encompasses only the children born to her after her conversion (and the direct maternal-line descendants of only her post-conversion children). Thus, natural-born Jewish status of a child (male or female) comes from its mother, via its maternal direct line of ancestry. As a consequence of the number of generations that have passed since the forced conversion of the Anusim ancestors of the Sephardic Bnei Anusim, the likelihood of a broken direct maternal Jewish lineage in that time (or the difficulty in producing documentary evidence proving otherwise) precludes the establishment of natural-born Jewishness. If the direct maternal lineage of a Sephardic Ben Anusim is not Jewish or cannot be proven to be Jewish (due to a lack of documentary evidence to that effect), it is irrelevant whether some or all other lineages of that Sephardic Ben Anusim are confirmed Jewish lineages (be it the direct paternal lineage, all other paternal lineages, or all other maternal lineages). Halakhically non-Jewish status, however, does not preclude Sephardic Bnei Anusim from being classed as Zera Yisrael, since they are otherwise of Jewish ancestry. On that basis, some individual Sephardic Bnei Anusim have begun formally returning to Judaism by following a formal process of conversion, and thus \\"regaining\\" their status as individual Jews. At least one Israeli Chief Rabbi has ruled that Sephardic Bnei Anusim should be considered Jewish for all purposes, but this is not the consensus. He says that a symbolic ceremony denoting reversion/conversion is necessary only in the event of a marriage in which a Sephardic Bnei Anusim origin is not shared by both spouses (i.e. a marriage between a spouse of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origin with a Jew of another community origin.). This pro-forma conversion for the purpose of marriage is solely to remove any doubt relating to any possibility of a broken maternal lineage (which religiously might affect the status of offspring borne to that marriage). It does not imply that the Sephardic Bnei Anusim are otherwise of Jewish ancestry. = Zera Yisrael = Although not halakhically Jewish as a collective group, Sephardic Bnei Anusim are broadly categorized as Zera Yisrael (◊ñ◊®◊¢ ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, literally \\"Seed of Israel\\"). Zera Yisrael are the Halakhically non-Jewish descendants of Jews who, for practical purposes, are neither completely Jewish nor completely gentile. According to some of the most prominent medieval Jewish sages, the designation of Zera Yisrael means that although these persons are not halakhically Jewish, they nevertheless embody ‚Äúthe holiness of Israel.‚Äù  History  = Relation to other Sephardi communities = The term Sephardi means \\"Spanish\\" or \\"Hispanic\\", and is derived from Sepharad, a Biblical location. The location of the biblical Sepharad is disputed, but later Jews identified the Sepharad as Hispania, that is, the Iberian Peninsula. Sepharad still means \\"Spain\\" in modern Hebrew. The common feature among Western Sephardim, Sephardic Bnei Anusim, and Neo-Western Sephardim is that all three are descended in part from conversos. \\"Western Sephardim\\" are descendants of ex-conversos from earlier centuries; \\"Sephardic Bnei Anusim\\" are nominally Christian descendants of conversos; and \\"Neo-Western Sephardim\\" refers to individuals among the Sephardic Bnei Anusim population who are converting to Judaism in order to return to the origin of some of their ancestors. The distinguishing factor between \\"Western Sephardim\\" and the nascent \\"Neo-Western Sephardim\\" is the time frame of the reversions to Judaism (in the present day, usually formal conversions are required because of the time from the original force conversion), the location of the reversions, and the religious and legal circumstances surrounding their reversions (including impediments and persecutions). The converso descendants who became the Western Sephardim had reverted to Judaism between the 16th and 18th centuries. They did so after migrating out of the Iberian cultural sphere and before the abolition of the Inquisition in the 19th century. Conversely, the converso descendants who are today becoming the Neo-Western Sephardim have been reverting to Judaism since the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Because the Inquisition had been abolished, these later converts have not have to leave the Iberian cultural sphere. = Differentiating Anusim and Bnei Anusim = The Sephardic Anusim (\\"forced [converts]\\") were the Jewish conversos to Catholicism and their second and third, fourth, and up to fifth generation converso descendants (the maximum acceptable generational distance depended on the particular Jewish responsa being followed by the receiving Jewish community). The Sephardic Bnei Anusim (\\"[later] children [of the] coerced [converts]\\"), on the other hand, were any subsequent generations of descendants of the Sephardic Anusim. These descendants, the Sephardic Bnei Ansuim, have remained hidden in Iberia and Ibero-America. They were subject to the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions in the Iberian Peninsula and its Inquisition franchises exported to the New World, and would have been persecuted as Jews. But also, intermarriage and other generations of practice meant that descendants began to live as Christians in a Latin world. The converso descendants of Sephardic Anusim in the Hispanosphere became the Sephardic Bnei Anusim. Conversely, those Sephardic Anusim who migrated to other countries (such as the Netherlands and Italy, among other places), tended to revert to Judaism. They have since been classified as the Western Sephardim. At least some Sephardic Anusim in the Hispanosphere (both in Iberia and their colonies in Ibero-America) had tried to maintain crypto-Jewish practices in privacy. Those who migrated to Ibero- America, especially, had initially also tried to revert to Judaism outright. Such choice was not feasible long-term in that Hispanic environment, as Judaizing conversos in Iberia and Ibero-America were subject to being persecuted, prosecuted, and liable to conviction and execution under the Inquisition. The Inquisition was not formally disbanded until the 19th century. = Past and present customs and practices = Among descendants of Sephardic Anusim, Some maintained crypto-Judaism. Some people today in Spain, Portugal and throughout Latin America have recognized that they retain familial customs of Jewish origins, because of publicity about research and DNA analysis showing Jewish ancestry. The specifics and origin for these practices within the family are more often than not no longer known, and usually the knowledge of the origin of the customs is vague. Some of these communities in Iberia and throughout Latin America have only recently begun to acknowledge such Jewish practices. Groups of Bnei Anusim in Latin America and Iberia congregate and associate as functional communities of Judaizers. Such practice was particularly persecuted under the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions, which were finally abolished in the 19th century. Under the Inquisition, the penalty for \\"Judaizing\\" by Jewish converts to Christianity (and their Christian-born descendants) was usually death by burning. A few of the members of modern-day organized groups of Sephardic Bnei Anusim who are openly Judaizers have formally converted in order to revert to Judaism. = Old and New World inquisitions and migrations = The Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions in the Iberian Peninsula, their persecution of New Christians of Jewish origin, and the virulent racial anti-Semitism are well known. The traditional Jewish holiday of Purim was celebrated disguised as the feast day of a fictional Christian saint, the \\"Festival of Santa Esterica\\". The branches of the Spanish Inquisition in the Americas, however, were originally established as a result of the complaints made by Spanish conquerors and settlers of Old Christian backgrounds to the Crown. They had noticed a significant illegal influx of New Christians of Sephardi origin into their colonies, many coming in via the Portuguese colony of Brazil. Only Spaniards of Old Christian backgrounds were legally allowed passage into the Spanish colonies as conquistadors and settlers. Many Spanish \\"New Christians\\" falsified their pedigree documents, or obtained perjured witness statements attesting pureza de sangre (purity of blood) from other New Christians who had entered the colonies and built up \\"Old Christian\\" identities. Others evaded the screening process through influence from family, friends, community connections, and acquaintances who were already passing as Old Christians. Some immigrants became members of ships' crews and assistants of conquistadors, lowly positions that did not require evidence of \\"pureza de sangre\\". (Later, even persons seeking these positions were more closely scrutinized). Portuguese New Christians, on the other hand, settled in South America via Brazil. From there some entered the Spanish colonies. Brazil was more lax at enforcing the prohibition on Sephardic New Christian immigrant passage. Between 1580 and 1640, when the Spanish Crown annexed the Kingdom of Portugal, the influx of Portuguese conversos into the Spanish colonies in South America became such that by the early 1600s the term \\"portugu√©s\\" had become synonymous with \\"Jewish\\" in the Spanish colonies. The Old Christian majority among the Portuguese in Portugal and Brazil complained that they were being denigrated by such association. To this day, Portuguese surnames are among the many descendants of these people in Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas. Many Hispanicized their surnames to fit Spanish orthography, hiding their \\"Portuguese\\" (i.e. Jewish) origin. = Reverting to Judaism = Only a small number of people of colonial-era Sephardic descent in Spain, Portugal, Hispanic America, or Brazil are reverting to Judaism. Generally formal or officially sanctioned or sponsored reversions by Jewish religious institutions, including the Israeli rabbinate, require individuals to undergo a formal conversion process to be accepted as Jews. Since the early 21st century, however, there has been a steady growth in the number of descendants indicating interest in a return to normative Judaism. Many Sephardic Bnei Anusim seem to have accepted their historical Jewish ancestry and generations of intermarriage, and a contemporary Christian affiliation, along with their modern national identities as Spaniards, Portuguese, and Latin Americans of various nations. Others have begun to syncretize their Christian religious identities and ethnic identities with an ethnic Jewish secular identity, without seeking reversion to Judaism. Among these are some who have shifted toward adopting Messianic Judaism (that is, Jewish-emphasizing forms of Christianity). Messianic Jewish congregations (styled less like churches, and more like synagogues) have been sprouting up around Latin America in the last several years, and are composed largely of Sephardic Bnei Anusim. Members of these congregations often call their congregation a sinagoga (Spanish for \\"synagogue\\"), Beit Knesset (Hebrew for \\"synagogue\\") or Kehilah (Hebrew for \\"congregation\\"). The fact of Sephardic Bnei Anusim leaning towards Messianic Jewish forms of Christianity, rather than reverting to Judaism itself, is suggested as a paradigm resulting from factors in Latin America. Some factors impede their adoption of normative Judaism.  Impeding factors  = Internal reluctance due to habitual tradition = Many Sephardic Bnei Ansuim are reluctant to fully abandon a Christian faith, which is what they and their immediate ancestors have lived with. It has been tradition in their families for centuries now. Some Sephardic Bnei Anusim who engage in Messianic Judaism, seem to be approaching normative Judaism. If they fully abandon central Christian doctrines incompatible with Judaism (such as the divinity of Jesus), they will leave Messianic Judaism and seek to embrace normative Judaism. = Targeting by Messianic Judaism = In addition, many Sephardic Bnei Anusim resent being targeted and prosyletized by Messianic Jewish organizations since there has been more publicity about the ancient, partially Jewish communities. Such Messianic Jewish organizations have been accused of discouraging Sephardic Bnei Anusim from rejoining normative Judaism, suggesting their faith as a form to integrate their complex ancestries. = Takkanah prohibition on conversions in Latin America = The major factor impeding reversions, however, stems from a takkanah, or Jewish religious edict, which was decreed in 1927 in Argentina. This was done at the request of recently arrived immigrant Eastern Sephardim from Syria. The normative Jewish community in Argentina (composed of a Syrian Sephardim minority and a European Ashkenazim majority, who were made up of 20th-century immigrants) ruled in the takkanah that, to combat the high rate of assimilation of the relatively newly formed Argentine Jewish community of that time, and their intermarriage with to gentiles, the local normative Jewish communities would not support conversion of gentile spouses, suspicious that they were insincere. Conversions in Argentina were prohibited \\"until the end of time\\". The takkanah was directed against gentiles of no historical Jewish ancestry. But the takkanah has been applied to all conversions, and thus have prevented any of the Sephardic Bnei Anusim in Argentina who may want to formally convert to Judaism. The takkanah was intended to combat what some of the community and rabbinate considered high rates of insincere conversions being performed solely to enable intermarriages of Jews to gentiles. Because sometimes such converts and their children did not fully embrace Judaism, there were net losses to the Jewish population. The takkanah has had influence throughout the rest of Latin America. Most local normative Jewish communities have continued to prohibit all conversions/reversions in the continent. New York City's Syrian Jewish community also adopted this prohibition, although in theory it was limited to conversions to be performed for the sake of marriage. As implemented in 1935, the takkanah in New York has been amended to say that \\"no future Rabbinic Court will have the right or authority to convert non-Jews who seek to marry into our [Syrian Jewish] community.\\" The takkanah in New York City holds no force among the overwhelmingly Ashkenazi Jewish population of the city and North America in general. Because of the takkanah, Sephardic Bnei Ansuim have accused normative Jewish communities in Latin America of classism, and racism, as many of their members have African and Native American or indigenous ancestry in addition to European. In Latin America the Jewish communities are predominantly made up of European Ashkenazim. For their part, the local Jewish communities (whether Ashkenazi or Syrian Sephardi) have insisted that the status quo of non-conversions/reversions in Latin America by local Jewish communities, and their isolated and insular natures in Latin America, is due to the historical anti-assimilationist needs for the Jewish community to survive. Often the Syrian Sephardim and European Ashkenazim were isolated from each other, as they came from different cultural spheres and tended to settle with others of their kind. They were not united across such barriers by Judaism. But in the 21st century, the Ashkenazim and Sephardim have largely melded into a single communal identity in Latin America. = Local Jewish desire to avoid accusations of proselytizing = In addition, the local Jewish communities did not want to be accused of proselytizing Judaism to Christian people. Latin American Catholics of non-Jewish background said that the Jews were \\"stealing souls\\" from the Catholic Church. Because of these factors, the limited numbers of recent reversions/conversions to Judaism performed in Latin America (especially South America), have generally been conducted by visiting religious emissaries from either North American Ashkenazi Jewish communities or delegated by the Israeli Rabbinate. The conversions/reversions have been based on a formal conversion process. Prospective applicants have to undergo at least one year of online Jewish religious study with the sponsoring foreign Jewish religious organization or authority. They must complete the physical requirements of reversion/conversion for the individual or small group, which are performed by a delegation sent by the foreign sponsoring foreign Jewish religious organization. Some individual Latin Americans have also reverted/converted to Judaism abroad. In the late 20th century a group of people in Iquitos, Peru, who believed they were descendants of 19th-century male Jewish traders and their indigenous wives, began to study Judaism seriously. They were aided by a rabbi from Brooklyn, New York. They were allowed to make aliyah to Israel. There they had to undergo formal conversion as overseen and conducted by Orthodox authorities in order to be accepted as Jewish. Their Jewish ancestors had been among Moroccan immigrants to Iquitos during the rubber boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Foreign Jewish outreach programs  Several foreign Jewish outreach organization are appealing to Sephardic Bnei Anusim. Among these is Shavei Israel, which operates in Spain, Portugal, and throughout Latin America, and has headquarters in Israel. They deal with Sephardi-descended Spaniards, Portuguese, and Latin Americans who are seeking a return to the Jewish people, after centuries of separation. Other organizations working to reach out to and/or reconnect the Sephardic Bnei Anusim include Sephardim Hope International and Reconectar.  Settlements and concentrations  = Iberia = In Iberia itself, known and attested settlements of Bnei Anusim include the population of Belmonte, in Portugal, and the Xueta of Palma de Majorca, in Spain. In 2011 Rabbi Nissim Karelitz, a leading Halachic authority and chairman of the Beit Din Tzedek rabbinical court in Bnei Brak, Israel, recognized the entire Xueta community of Bnei Anusim in Palma de Majorca, as Jews. That population consisted of approximately 18,000 people, or just over 2% of the entire population of the island. Of the Bnei Anusim community in Belmonte, Portugal, some officially returned to Judaism in the 1970s. They opened a synagogue, Bet Eliahu, in 1996. The Belmonte community of Bnei Anusim as a whole, however, have not yet been granted the same recognition as Jews that the Xueta of Palma de Majorca achieved in 2011. Both Portugal and Spain have people with Jewish ancestry. According to DNA studies, up to 20% of the modern population of Spain and Portugal have Jewish ancestry. Some are likely Bnei Ansuim whose Sephardic Jewish ancestors converted but stayed in the Peninsula. = Ibero-America = Recent historical studies suggest that the number of New Christians of Sephardi origin who participated in the conquest and settlement was more significant than previously estimated. Noted Spanish conquistadors, administrators, settlers, and Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n, chronicler, have been confirmed to have been of Sephardi origin. Recent discoveries have been related to newly found records in Spain,. These have related to conversions, marriages, baptisms, and Inquisition trials of the parents, grandparents and great-grandparents of the Sephardi-origin Iberian immigrants. Overall, scholars estimate that up to 10% of colonial Latin America's Iberian settlers may have been of Sephardic origin. Their regional distribution of settlement was varied. Iberian settlers of New Christian origin ranged anywhere from none in most areas, to as high as 1 in every 3 (approx. 30%) Iberian settlers in other areas. Recent DNA studies and historical settlement patterns of New Christians indicate that the concentration of these Hispanic/Latino- assimilated Christian-professing descendants of Sephardic Jews are found primarily in the following localities (from north to south): * The formerly Spanish/Mexican-held American Southwest, especially northern New Mexico and southern Colorado * The northernmost states of Mexico bordering the American Southwest, particularly Nuevo Le√≥n * Serid√≥ region in northeastern Brazil * The Antioquia department of central Colombia * South and central regions of Ecuador, especially Loja and Zaruma * The sierra areas of northwestern Peru * Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia's east * The R√≠o de la Plata Basin region in eastern Argentina, and * The southern region of Chile. The common characteristic of all the above-mentioned localities is that they are situated in remote areas, isolated either by distance or geographical features from the Spanish colonial administrative centers. These were located in Mexico City, in central Mexico, and Lima, in central Peru. This contrasts with the initial settlement patterns of the New Christians during the early days of the Spanish Conquest. Most settled in the urban colonial and commercial hubs of Mexico City and Lima, seeking more familiar centers to their former lives. When the Spanish Inquisition was introduced to the New World, it set up bases in Mexico City and Lima. Many New Christians fled to more geographically isolated areas in neighboring Spanish colonies, and it was also a pattern of gradual settlement of the more distant areas. These events accomplished the depopulation of Sephardi-origin New Christians from all of Peru and Mexico, other than their respective northernmost regions.  Later Sephardic arrivals  After the Inquisition was finally officially disbanded in the 19th century, descendants of Sephardim immigrated to Latin America as Jews. These Sephardim are clearly distinguishable history from the Sephardic Bnei Anusim. The following are a few of the more notable immigration waves of Sephardic Jews into Latin America since the 19th century. During the rubber boom in the 19th century, Peru received Sephardic immigrants, many of whom were North African Sephardim from Morocco. Thousands of their mostly assimilated mixed-race (mestizo) descendants still live throughout the Amazon basin. (See also Amazonian Jews). Mexico and Argentina also received Sephardic immigrants, many being Eastern Sephardim from Syria. This wave arrived prior to and following World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Venezuela received Western Sephardim in its northern region from neighboring island nations to its north. These Western Sephardic immigrants usually arrived with other Dutch immigrants to their colonies in the Americas such as Cura√ßao, as they had first settled in the tolerant Netherlands. They have also settled in places such as Panama, Honduras, and Colombia. This multi-stop migration was a centuries-long process. The descendants of Western Sephardi immigrants in Latin America include at least four heads of state: Max Delvalle Levy-Maduro and his nephew Eric Arturo Delvalle Cohen-Henr√≠quez (both presidents of Panama); Ricardo Maduro (former president of Honduras), all three of whom were raised as Jews; and Nicol√°s Maduro (current president of Venezuela, who was raised as Catholic). North African Sephardim in Peru have largely assimilated to the majority culture, in part because their early immigrants were mostly men, who married local women to establish their families. Eastern Sephardim in Mexico, who arrived as families, have remained largely in Jewish communities. Western Sephardim in Hispanic America have include both descendants who have assimilated and others who live as Jews. = Israel = There is a small but strong contingent of Jewish immigrants to Israel from Latin America, predominantly from within the normative Jewish (Ashkenazi and Sephardi) communities resident in Latin America. Among these immigrants from Latin America, however, there are also some, but not many, persons of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origin that have also immigrated, most of which arrived in Israel after official reversions/conversions outside Israel. It has been reported in the Israeli media that some Sephardic Bnei Anusim have regularized their status once in Israel after arriving as tourists or visitors. Other Sephardic Bnei Ansuim have been deported or threatened with deportation. In one instance in 2009, the Interior Ministry sought to deport the elderly Bnei Anusim parents of Colombian siblings who were Israeli citizens. All the members of the family are of Bnei Ansuim heritage, but only the younger generation (the siblings) had reverted to Judaism, while their parents had not. The siblings made aliyah as Jews and acquired Israeli citizenship. Having been left alone in Colombia, the parents then followed their children to Israel, where they lived with them for 5 years. The parents were then threatened with deportation.  Law of Return  The Israeli Law of Return does not apply to Sephardic Bnei Anusim in their own right unless, on an individual basis, a prospective applicant for the Law of Return who is of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origin has officially reverted/converted to Judaism. In the case of Sephardic Bnei Anusim who officially revert/convert to Judaism through a normative Jewish community, the Law of Return then encompasses that individual not because the applicant is of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origin (i.e. having Jewish ancestry), but because he or she is now an official normative Jew following formal reversion/conversion to Judaism. Please see that article for further information on the details of the Law of Return.  Public awareness campaigns  Several organizations catering to Sephardic Bnei Anusim have been established around Israel. Some are cultural and information centres for the education of the general Israeli public, while others are a combination of cultural and information centres which also promote and provide assistance and advocate for rights to conversions, immigration and absorption of reverts to Judaism of Sephardic Bnei Ansuim origin. Casa Shalom holds lectures and seminars in their centre in Netanya, Israel and work to help Sephardic Bnei Ansusim investigate and reclaim their heritage. Shavei Israel, with headquarters in Jerusalem is an advocacy and Jewish outreach organization with links to religious institutions in helping Bnei Anusim in their branches in Spain, Portugal and South America return to Judaism. Shavei Israel has thus far assisted over 2,000 Bnei Anusim in Spain and Portugal to return to Judaism. Sephardi Hope International (SHI) runs the Anusim Center in Be'er Sheva, Israel. Reconectar has a mission to reconnect those descendants of Spanish and Portuguese Jewish communities that wish it, and at the level they seek, with the Jewish world. Ashley Perry is the current president of the organization and also director of the Knesset Caucus for the Reconnection with the Descendants of Spanish and Portuguese Jewish communities. = India = Outside of Iberia and the Iberian colonies in the Americas, the Portuguese colony of Goa, now part of India, also received Sephardic Anusim, where they were subjected to the Goa Inquisition. In 1494, after the signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas, authorized by Pope Alexander VI, Portugal was given the right to found colonies in the Eastern Hemisphere and Spain was given dominance over the New World. In the East, as Professor Walter Fischel, the now deceased Chair of the Department of Near Eastern History at the University of California - Berkeley, explains, the Portuguese found use for the Sephardic anusim in Goa and their other Indian and Asian possessions. Jews were used as \\"letter-carriers, translators, agents, etc.\\" The ability of the Sephardic Jews and anusim to speak Arabic made them vital to Portuguese colonial ambitions in the East, where they could interact and go on diplomatic and trade missions in the Muslim courts of the Mughal Empire. India also attracted Sephardic Jews and anusim for other reasons. In his lecture at the Library of Congress, Professor Sanjay Subrahmanyam, Chair in Social Sciences at University of California, Los Angeles, explains that Sephardic anusim were especially attracted to India because not only was it a center of trade in goods such as spices and diamonds, but India also had established and ancient Jewish settlements, such as the one at Cochin, along its Western coast. The presence of these older communities offered the anusim, who had been forced to accept Catholicism, the chance to live within the Portuguese Empire, away from the Inquisition, and, if they wished, they were able to contact the Jews in these communities and re-adopt the faith of their fathers. The presence of anusim in India aroused the anger of the Archbishop of Goa, Dom Gaspar Jorge de Le√£o Pereira and others who wrote polemics and letters to Lisbon urging that the Inquisition be brought to India. Twenty-four years after Portuguese Inquisition began, the Goan Inquisition came to India in 1560 after Francis Xavier placed another request for it to the King of Portugal. The impact of anusim in Portuguese India and Portugal's other eastern colonies continues to be a subject of on- going academic research. There was also an influential presence of Sephardic anusim in the Fort St. George which was later called Madras and is today called Chennai, India. In its earlier years under Governor Elihu Yale (who later founded Yale University) appointed three Jewish aldermen (out of a total of 12 aldermen) to represent the Jewish population in the fledgling city. The conqueror of Jaffna kingdom, included Phillippe de Oliveira, probably has Sephardi origin with his surname and he probably has converso ancestry. Oliveiras has family tradition source which said this surname has origin of Levite or Judah from the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.  DNA and genetics  In some cases, Sephardi-descended Hispanics of the communities of Bnei Anusim have inherited genetic mutations and diseases to Jews or Sephardi Jews in particular, including Jewish-specific mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes which increases the risk of breast cancer (found also among Hispanos of the Southwestern United States) and Laron syndrome (found also among Ecuadorians). The mutations are found in Ashkenazic Jews of European maternal lineage, who have European mt-DNA that is passed from mother to child, and in Anusim women of Hispanic maternal lineage. The Ashkenazi Anusim and Hispanic Anusim are different from the Middle Eastern Sephardi Jews Anusim. The Ancestors of the Middle Eastern Sephardi Jews Anusim exiled from the Middle East to Spain. \\"...This is the largest study to date of high-risk Hispanic families in the United States. Six recurrent mutations accounted for 47% (16 of 34) of the deleterious mutations in this cohort. The BRCA1185delAG mutation was prevalent (3.6%) in this clinic-based cohort of predominantly Mexican descent, and shared the Ashkenazi Jewish founder haplotype.  Surnames  Almost all Sephardic Bnei Anusim today carry surnames which are known to have been used by Sephardic Jews during the 15th century. Surnames known to have been carried by Jews included Cueva, Luna, Le√≥n, P√©rez, L√≥pez, Salazar, C√≥rdova, Torres, Castro, √Ålvarez, Gonz√°lez, G√≥mez, Fern√°ndez, Costa, Mendes, Rivera, Maduro. Then other surnames included De Leon and de Oliveira. It is extremely important to note, however, that all of these mentioned surnames, and almost all other surnames which were carried by 15th century Sephardim, were never specifically Jewish in origin, that is, they were never exclusively \\"Sephardic surnames\\", if such a thing exists other than in the most rarest and limited of cases. Almost all these surnames are in fact surnames of gentile Spanish origin (or gentile Portuguese origin) which only became common among Sephardic Jews (and consequently among Sephardic Anusim when Sephardic Jews converted to Catholicism under pressure, and passed by these onto their Bnei Anusim descendants) precisely because Sephardic Jews deliberately adopted these surnames, which were stereotypically common among the Old Christian population. In this way, they hoped to be associated with being Old Christians, in an attempt to obscure their true Jewish pedigrees, and avoid discrimination and social ostracism. After conversion, New Christians of Jewish origin generally adopted Christian given names and Old Christian surnames. Eventually, all Old Christian given names and surnames were in use by New Christians of Jewish origin. Only a small number of surnames held by Sephardic Bnei Anusim (or for that matter, only a very few surnames held by modern-day Sephardic Jews who may still carry Spanish and Portuguese surnames) are surnames that pertain exclusively to a Sephardic or Sephardic Anusim origin to the exclusion of any Old Christian carriers of the same surname. Among descendants of Sephardic Jews today, there are three categories of descendants: 1) Eastern Sephardim and North African Sephardim, being those who are today Jewish because they descend from Sephardim who remained Jewish (never becoming New Christians), and left Iberia before the deadline set in the Alhambra Decree. 2) Western Sephardim, being those who are today Jewish because they descended from Sephardim who initially became New Christians because they did not, or could not, leave Iberia by the deadline set in the Alhambra Decree, but later reverted to Judaism (even if generations later) once they finally left Iberia by venturing to places other than the Iberian colonies in the Americas. 3) Sephardic Bnei Anusim (including Neo-Western Sephardim), the subjects of this article, being those who are today fully assimilated as Spanish, Portuguese, Hispanic or Brazilian Christians, since they descend from Sephardim who became New Christians, never reverted to Judaism in any subsequent generation, because they could not leave Iberia or they ventured to the Iberian colonies in the Americas where the Inquisition eventually followed them. Generally, it is only those who descend from Eastern Sephardim and North African Sephardim who carry surnames which typically identify the surname (and thus the carrier of the surname) as being of Jewish origins. The other descendants of Sephardic Jews (those descended from Western Sephardim, and especially those who are Sephardic Bnei Anusim and Neo-Western Sephardim) almost always carry \\"Old Christian\\" Spanish or Portuguese surnames because they became nominal Christians, whether intermittently or permanently. Especially for Western Sephardim, Sephardic Bnei Anusim, and Neo-Western Sephardim, only a very and extremely limited number of surnames carried by are exclusively Jewish or \\"New Christian\\" surnames being capable of, on their own, indicating Jewish origins of the surname or the surname-carrier. The great majority of the surnames of persons in these groups are, per se, Old Christian surnames, and these surnames alone cannot indicate a Jewish origin without congregational membership (if the person is a Western Sephardic Jew), or accompanying genealogical documentation, family traditions and customs, and/or Genealogical DNA testing (if the person is a Sephardic Ben/Bat Anusim or a newly reverted Neo-Western Sephardic Jew). Although it is true that a few surnames among those specifically mentioned above became popularly adopted by New Christians (including, most notably the surname P√©rez, because of its similarity to the Hebrew surname Peretz), such popularly adopted surnames by New Christians remain Old Christian surnames in origin, and carrying these surnames does not by itself indicate Jewish ancestry. This phenomenon is much the same as is the situation with surnames which are typically considered to be Ashkenazi \\"Jewish\\" surnames. Most \\"Jewish\\" surnames among Ashkenazi Jews are not in fact \\"Jewish\\" per se, but are simply German or Slavic surnames (including so-called \\"Jewish\\" names like Goldberg) which were adopted by Ashkenazi Jews, some of which became so overwhelmingly carried by Jews that they came to be seen as \\"Jewish\\", although there are gentile carriers of those same surnames, because it is with those gentile families that the surnames originated to begin with. Only some surnames found among Ashkenazi Jews today are surnames which are exclusively \\"Jewish\\" surnames being capable of, on their own, indicating Jewish origins of the carrier.

It was known historically as \\"Seven Mile Island\\" during the American Revolution and by the Onondaga people as Kah-wha-nah-kee. Though it was once home to a popular resort, the island is today uninhabited and largely undeveloped, with the exception of an abandoned lighthouse and dock on the south side of the island. The island is open to the public for recreational use, however it can only be reached by boat. Origin of name Frenchman Island derives its name from a legend describing the island's first colonial inhabitants. The story varies between accounts, but generally tells of a French man and a wealthy French woman who eloped to the Americas in defiance of the woman's father. They built a home upon the island in the late 1700s where they remained for seven years, having three children during that time. Visitors were surprised to find a well-apportioned home upon the island, which was at that time deep in a largely unsettled wilderness. Eventually, the father reconciled with his daughter, and the family was allowed to return to France. Alexis de Tocqueville visited the island in 1831, retracing the story of the Frenchman in Joachim Heinrich Campe's Voyage au lac On√©ida (1803), but found only scanty remains of the house. Frenchman Island Lighthouse View of the Frenchman Island Lighthouse shortly after its completion in 1917. The island hosts one of the three lighthouses used to guide navigation on Oneida Lake. The lighthouses were built in 1917 as part of the New York State Barge Canal, which uses Oneida Lake as part of its water route from the Hudson River to Lake Erie. The Frenchman Island Lighthouse is still in operation today and is managed by the New York State Canal Corporation. While the lighthouse was completed in August 1917, it may not have been first lit until 1918. Today, the tower's 1,500 candlepower occulting white light is powered by commercial electricity, although it was gas-powered for several years after its initial completion. The tower was originally constructed to be tall, and an additional was added to the tower in 1949. It was constructed atop an rise on the island, making the current total focal height of the lighthouse above lake level. Light from the tower is visible from up to away. Public use Picnicking on Dunhams Island with Frenchman Island in distance, c. 1910. The island has historically been a popular location for sightseeing and picnicking. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the island featured a small resort with a two- story inn and a bowling alley. Trains from Syracuse would deliver passengers to steamboats that made regular trips the island, where visitors would find \\"boating, sailing, fishing, bathing, tennis, croquet, base-ball and good music.\\" In the latter part of the 20th century, the island was managed by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation as Frenchman Island State Park, though it was largely undeveloped with little remaining to show from its days as a resort. Due to persistent vandalism, the park was closed for many years before re-opening in 2008. Jurisdiction of the island was transferred to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in 2011 with plans for them to manage the island as a Wildlife Management Area. The island became part of the Three Mile Bay Wildlife Management Area.

It was built . It is also known as Smellie & Co Warehouse and Public Works Depot. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This building was constructed for the engineering and iron founding firm of Harvey Sargeant & Co., which was founded in 1880 and was part of the fledgling heavy engineering industry in Queensland. It produced ironworks, brick making machinery, girders, and agricultural machinery. The ironworks necessary for much of the building boom carried out in Brisbane in the 1880s were supplied by Harvey, Sargeant, & Co. In 1885 the company purchased a site in Alice Street for a foundry and a building was erected . Called the Britannia Foundry, it was one of several foundries in the street, including Smellie & Co, and Smith, Forrester & Co, who operated the Queensland Ironworks. Harvey, Sargeant & Co went into insolvency in 1892, but a new company was formed to continue operating the foundry. In 1903 the business moved to new premises in Alice Street. The firm remained in this part of the city until 1966 when it moved to Sherwood, where it traded under the name of ANI-Sargeant for many years, celebrating its centenary in 1981. In 1909 the property was purchased by Smellie & Co, a firm which imported machinery and farming equipment, for use as a warehouse. Smellie's owned adjacent properties in Alice and Edward Streets (Old Mineral House and Smellie's Building). In 1945, Smellie & Co sold the building, along with its other properties to the Queensland Government. The Department of Public Works has used this building as a workshop, and more recently for storage. The building was subsequently sold by the Department and is now used as commercial offices.  Description  This two-storeyed building, situated in Alice Street, is of brick construction with a rendered facade and a galvanised iron roof. The facade has semi-circular arched windows on both levels. There are eight openings on the upper level and three to each side of a central square carriage way on the lower level. All the arched openings have moulded architraves, sills, and ornamented keystones. An opening on the ground floor has been converted to a doorway. A pilaster of vermiculated quoins runs down the northern end of the facade. A frieze and dentilled cornice extend across the building and are surmounted by two simple triangular pediments with scroll-like brackets to each side. The rear elevation had a circular opening and four rectangular ones, all of which have been blocked up. A steel escape stair and aluminium framed glazed doors have been inserted on the exposed side of the building facing the yard. The interior of the building has been altered but still shows evidence of its original construction and use. Some cast-iron columns incorporating brackets remain at the front of the building on the ground floor. The timber trusses of the two gable roofs are exposed on the upper level.  Heritage listing  Britannia Foundry was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building also provides evidence of engineering and foundry works which previously were a major activity in the Alice Street area. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is significant as an example of an intact 1880s industrial building with a decorative facade. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is significant for its contribution to the Alice Street streetscape along with neighbouring Old Mineral House.

It is also used as a musical instrument in folk music, in particular, in Romani music of Hungary.\\"Cegl√©di kanna\\" , Cegl√©di Panorama; lexicon Container A Cegl√©d jug is a 7-9 liter metal jug for water, with a handle and a lid. It is a relatively modern invention. They were first manufactured by a J√°nos R√≥nay in Cegl√©d in the 1910s. Before the wide distribution of water pipelines, Cegl√©d jugs were popular for delivery of water to farmers during harvest, construction and other workers away from residential places. They quickly became popular, because they were not fragile like pottery jugs, easy to carry by hand, on bicycle or in a car, and were easy to clean. Since there was only one manufacturer for a long time, the name stuck.\\"Cegl√©di kanna\\", Magyar Vagyok, Zolt√°n Kabai, September 15, 2010 (retrieved February 28, 2015) Originally Cegl√©d jugs were made of galvanized tin. Later they were made of aluminium and steel, both bare metal and enamel-covered, typically of red, blue or white color. Despite the complicated shape, the jug (without handle) was made of a single metal sheet. For sturdiness, the mouth and bottom rims were doubly folded. The handle was attached by rivets. Musical instrument Cegl√©d jugs became a rhythm musical instrument among Romani in 1970 through the 1980s. The first usage of the jug is attributed to K√°roly Rost√°s (\\"Hutty√°n\\"). Later it was perfected by other Roma musicians, such as Kalyi Jag.\\"Brummog√≥ b≈ëg≈ë helyett cegl√©di kanna\\", L√°szl√≥ Rab, NOL (N√©pszabads√°g Online), November 27, 2009 (retrieved February 27, 2015) When hit by palms, Cegl√©d jugs produce a wide variety of sounds, depending on the place hit (handle, body, rim), whether it is struck or slapped, whether the jug mouth is muffled, etc. The combination of metal sound and deep dull sound of the air cavity puts the instrument in categories of idiophones and wind instruments.S√°rosi, B√°lint Hangszerek a magyar n√©phagyom√°nyban (\\" Musical Instruments in Hungarian Folklore\\"), Budapest, Plan√©t√°s, 1998, In 2008 and 2009, two Cegl√©di KannaB√°l festivals, that highlighted this musical instrument, took place.

History The discovery of gold, silver and other valuable natural resources throughout the Idaho territory beginning in the 1860s, as well as the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, brought many new people to the area, including Chinese laborers who came to work the mines. Where two rivers, creeks, or streams divided, prospectors would each and follow the richer one in their search for the source of the gold also known as the mother lode. A quartz vein outcropping containing gold was discovered by prospectors in 1862 which led to a series of mining claims that resulted in the formation of a mining district called territory Quartzburg aka Quartburgh. Just before WWII a catastrophic fire consumed both the mine mill and small town in 1938. Two years after the fire the post office closed signaling the end of 78 years of prospecting, mining, and logging. The 1941 Mining Act prohibited precious metal mining through the war and small mining never recovered in the United States. The Idaho territory was once the home of upwards of as many as 8,000 Chinese miners. The 1870 census reported there were 1,751 Chinese in Idaho City who were nearly half of city residents. Annie Lee was a legendary Idaho city woman who like Polly Bemis, escaped enslavement as a prostitute. She escaped from a member of the Yeong Wo Company in the 1870s to Boise to marry her lover, another Chinese man. that she wanted to remain in Boise.Surviving on the gold mountain: a history of Chinese American women By Huping Ling The story of Polly Bemis, who helped settle the Idaho territory became the basis for the novel and fictionalized 1991 film A Thousand Pieces of Gold, which was set in California. Idaho became the fourth state to grant women the right to vote in 1896, six years after gaining statehood. Town Name The name of the town has changed over time. The town began as Quartzburg, was changed to Quartzburgh in 1894, and then finally Quartzburg. Regional Geography The Boise Basin, which lies in Boise County, Idaho, is an intermountain depression near the western edge of the mountainous region that occupies the central part of the State. The Boise Basin is separated from the Snake River plains on the west by Boise Ridge; the low-lying divide between Payette River and Mores Creek is its northern boundary; and high mountains flank it on the east and south. Rock Type: Mesozoic intrusive rocks Rock Age: Cretaceous (66 - 145 Ma) Quartz Quartz Formula:SiO2https://www.mindat.org/min-3337.html At higher temperatures and pressures quartz is easily dissolved by watery fluids percolating the rock. When silica-rich solutions penetrate cooler rocks, the silica will precipitate as quartz in fissures, forming thin white seams as well as large veins which may extend over many kilometers.(Bons, 2001; Wangen and Munz, 2004, Pati et al, 2007) In most cases, the quartz in these veins will be massive, but they may also contain well-formed quartz crystals. Phyllites and schists often contain thin lenticular or regular veins of so-called \\"segregation quartz\\" (Vinx, 2013) that run parallel to the bedding and are the result of local transport of silica during metamorphosis.(Chapman, 1950; Sawyer and Robin, 1986) Silica-rich fluids are also driven out of solidifying magma bodies. When these hot brines enter cooler rocks, the solution gets oversaturated in silica, and quartz forms. Orogeny The process by which structures within fold-belt mountainous areas were formed, including thrusting, folding, and faulting in the outer and higher layers, and plastic folding, metamorphism, and plutonism in the inner and deeper layers. Adj: orogenic; orogenetic. Orogenic Gold Deposits Orogenic gold deposits (B√∂hlke, 1982) dominantly form in metamorphic rocks in the mid- to shallow crust (5‚Äì15 km depth), at or above the brittle-ductile transition, in compressional settings that facilitate transfer of hot gold-bearing fluids from deeper levels.(Goldfarb et al., 2005; Groves et al., 1998; Phillips and Powell, 2009) The term ‚Äúorogenic‚Äù is used because these deposits likely form in accretionary and collisional orogens.(Groves et al., 1998) Transfer of weakly oxidized, low-salinity fluids to the sites of gold deposition is controlled by earthquake events,(Cox, 2005; Sibson et al., 1988) allowing fluids to rapidly traverse large thicknesses of the crust. This rapid rise takes the fluids out of equilibrium with their surrounding rocks, promoting destabilization of the gold-carrying hydrosulfide complexes [Au(HS)2‚àí and AuHS]. The chemical cause of gold precipitation, facilitated by a temperature-pressure decrease, varies from place to place, and mechanisms such as fluid-rock reaction,(Evans et al., 2006) boiling,(Weatherley and Henley, 2013) fluid mixing,(Bateman and Hagemann, 2004) and chemisorption on surfaces of pyrite and arsenopyrite (e.g., M√∂ller and Kersten, 1994) have been proposed. Nearby Towns and Accessibility In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Idaho City, Centerville, Placerville, Quartzburg, and Pioneerville were the principal centers of the Idaho gold mining industry. All the towns are connected by roads, and several roads lead to outside points. Idaho City, the county seat, is connected to Boise by a 32 mile long. \\\\- From Horseshoe Bend - Hawkins toll road crossed a ridge at an altitude of 5,500 feet and connected Placerville and Horseshoe Bend. Now called Harris Creek Road. \\\\- Garden Valley to Placerville - Alder Creek Road. \\\\- Pioneerville is also connected with Garden Valley by a road over Grimes Pass. \\\\- East of Idaho City a road crosses the divide between the drainage basins of Moore Creek and North Fork of Boise River and leads to the Edna and Banner silver mines. Early Railroads James T. Barber founded the Barber Lumber Company in 1902 with a group of investors. The company employed upwards of 300 men who constructed a wooden dam across the Boise River to provide a log pond and an electrical plant for the sawmill. In addition to the sawmill, Barber Lumber Company also consisted of a planing mill, box factory, dry kilns, lumber yard, horse barns, and a railroad with facilities for locomotives and railroad cars. The Barber sawmill closed in 1935. Intermountain Railroad was owned and operated by the Barber Lumber Co. The Intermountain Railroad serviced the Boise Basin and mining communities early on. Last Chance Mill Mine The Last Chance Mine is a gold mine located in Boise County, Idaho at an elevation of 4,902 feet. In 1899 the mine was owned by three men. O.J. Daly had 50%, Henry Beary and George Faull each owned 25%. Gold Hill Mine After a fire consumed the mill and town in 1938, the mine was abandoned.

May Wilson is a telegraph operator and Jack Wilson is the head bookkeeper of the brokerage office. May teaches Jack how to use Morse Code. At the end of the day is called to into the office and learns that something is wrong with the books and he quickly finds the guilty party and confronts him. While he leans into the safe, Bill pushes him inside and locks the safe before fleeing. May, who is waiting for Jack, goes to the office and searches for him. Hearing groans from the safe, she knows he is in danger and uses Morse code to learn the combination and free him. Later, Bill returns to the scene to see if Jack is dead. As he opens the door, the police pop out of the safe and arrest him. The film was released on September 30, 1910 and was met with mixed reviews for the improbable plot and the inaccurate Morse code being tapped out on screen. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 1, 1910. It states: \\"May Wilson and Jack Preston are employed at a downtown brokerage office, she as telegraph operator of the private wire of the firm, and he as head bookkeeper. The young people are fond of each other, and at the opening of the play have just made an engagement to spend the evening in each other's company at one of the theatres. May has been teaching Jack mysteries of the Morse code and is greatly pleased when she finds that he has so far mastered it as to be able to rap back an answer to her messages. After May has left the office for the day, the head of the firm calls Jack into his private office and there confides to him that there is something wrong with the books of the concern, and tells Jack to investigate. On looking into the matter, Jack discovers that his fellow worker, Carson, is the defaulter, and accuses him to his face. Alone in the office, Carson begs Jack to shield him, while Jack insists that he must make their employer conversant with the facts. As Jack leans far into the large safe to deposit the ledgers of the firm, Bill thrusts him inside, and turning the knob entombs him alive in the steel prison. Trembling with fear at his act, Bill steals cautiously from the office.\\" \\"May, becoming impatient when theatre time arrives and Jack fails to call for her, decides that he must still be working at the office, forgetful of the lateness of the hour. She proceeds to the office to remind him of his appointment, and finding it deserted, she is about to leave, when muffled groans reach her from the safe. She realizes that it must be her sweetheart who is imprisoned, and that unless she can free him in short order, he will surely die of suffocation. Not knowing the combination of the safe, and being unable to reach by telephone her employer, she suddenly conceives the idea that if by telegraphic signal she can make known to the man in the safe that she is there, trying to help him, he in his turn can in the same code give her the combination of the safe. This plan works out successfully, the two lovers tapping out their messages against the steel sides of the safe. The door of the safe finally yields to the combination, and Jack's apparently lifeless body rolls to the floor of the office. May revives him, and amid tears and laughter they rejoice over Jack's narrow escape. Haunted by the fear of what he has done, Bill creeps stealthily back into the office, opens the door of the safe, impelled to learn its horrible secret. As the door opens he is confronted by two officers of the law, who place him under arrest.\\"  Cast  *Anna Rosemond as May Wilson The credits for Jack Preston and Bill, amongst the other minor roles of the manager and the police are unknown.  Production  The writer of the scenario was Lloyd Lonergan, who was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while he was writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only one credit is known and that is Anna Rosemond as May Wilson. The rest of the credits are unknown and like other productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying one other actor. The actual Morse code being tapped out did not match what was actually being said according to Walton of The Moving Picture News. Another reviewer wrote, \\"It is rather to be regretted that the Thanhouser people did not make the most of this climax by introducing telegraphic dots and dashes in a manner to create suspense. By this is meant that had a few lines of dots and dashes been flashed on the screen, word by word, and with each word spelled out in letters beneath each dot and dash, it would have given a telegraphic semblance or realism to the scene.\\" This film was an early example of the use of the character names Jack and May, which were to be repeatedly used by Lonergan in various productions. Bowers writes, \\"It developed that Lloyd F. Lonergan, who wrote the scenario, liked these names, and during the years to come used them again and again. One can imagine that it must have become a studio joke to decide who was to play Jack and who was to play May. In actuality, names such as Jack and May were used in printed synopses to keep track of who was who, but such names were usually not mentioned in the film's subtitles. Patrons watching the picture in a theatre had not the foggiest idea whether the hero was named Jack, Bertram, or Ezekiel.\\" Previously, May had been a name used by Marie Eline in The Best Man Wins and Jack had been used in The Writing on the Wall by an unknown actor.  Release and reception  The single-reel drama, approximately 950 feet long, was released on September 30, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with advertising theaters known in Washington, Pennsylvania, Arizona, South Dakota, and Kansas. The film was released in Britain on December 18, 1910. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer stated, \\"The story is clear and interesting, and the acting is excellent. Perhaps the best actress of the lot is the vivacious scrubwoman, although she has the easy comic role. Good as the acting is, it does not cover up several improbabilities in the plot. It takes the hero a marvelously short time to find out who has been tampering with the books of the company, and he foolishly lets the villain lock the vault doors upon him. A real girl would never have set out to find her escort to the theatre, even if he was late; least of all would she have gone unchaperoned to the office at night. The villain would not have returned to discover the fate of the hero; he would lose no time in getting miles away from the scene of his crime. Dots and Dashes is well mounted.\\" Aside from these \\"improbabilities\\" Walton of The Moving Picture News praised the film and the story after being critical of Morse code tapping being not accurate. Walton wrote, \\"The general public - excluding such cranks as I am - will enjoy your honest work.\\" A reviewer for The Moving Picture World, who saw the film at the studio, also praised the film and its climax.

It was designed by Slatyer & Cosh and built in 1900. It is also known as Edwards Dunlop Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This building was erected in 1900 for Edwards Dunlop & Co Ltd, a Sydney-based paper merchandising firm. The architects were probably the Sydney firm Slatyer & Cosh. The building featured an electric lift, modern fire fighting equipment and an extensive telephone system. The company occupied the building on 1 January 1901, the day of Federation. It was an apt moment, as Federation removed many of the obstacles to intercolonial trade, allowing Sydney-based companies like Edwards Dunlop to more economically tap the Queensland market. By 1910 the company was considered to be the largest paper wholesaling firm in the state. It was the contractor to the Queensland Department of Public Instruction, supplying text and exercise books and wall maps to schools around the state. The company acquired adjoining portions of land in 1925 and 1957, taking their block in an L-shape to Charlotte Street. In 1974 Edwards Dunlop moved to premises at Eagle Farm, and in the following year the building was purchased by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane. Renovations and modifications were undertaken which included the installation of a new lift and stairs, the construction of video and radio studios, and the provision of access to St Stephen's Cathedral. The building is currently occupied by various Catholic organisations. In 2013, the Catholic archdiocese took the owners of the adjacent Exchange Hotel to court in an attempt to stop an extension to the hotel, citing the impact on both the Catholic Centre and St Stephen's Cathedral.  Description  This polychrome brick and stone Federation era building comprises four storeys with a basement. The upper three levels are encompassed by giant order pilasters that separate the window openings. These have plain capitals that support cut stone semi-circular arches over the top windows. The parapet has four shallow concave curves punctuated by projecting piers at the centre and ends. The street facade has three entrances. The main entry on the western end is emphasised by a projecting stone pediment and another served as a carriageway. The windows to the major ground floor space are shaded by the later addition of a deep corrugated iron sun-hood supported on cast iron brackets. The windows to the basement are separated by rusticated stone piers and protected by cast iron picket screens. The rear of the building has been painted and has a tall T-shaped arched tank stand located centrally at the top. Internally elements of finely detailed original joinery survive. Timber posts, beams and brick walls are unpainted.  Heritage listing  Catholic Centre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Catholic Centre is significant as a Federation era warehouse with a finely detailed face brick and stone facade, much intact internal structure, and joinery. The Catholic Centre is significant for its contribution to the Edward Street streetscape, which here is dominated by late nineteenth and early twentieth century buildings. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

She assumed the name of Marie-√âlisabeth as her religious name after she became a nun. Turgeon was cleared for beatification in 2014 after a miracle that had found to have been attributed to her intercession was cleared. She was beatified on 26 April 2015 in Canada by Cardinal Angelo Amato on behalf of Pope Francis.http://ici.radio- canada.ca/regions/est-quebec/2015/03/16/005-elisabeth-turgeon- beatification.shtml#!< Biography Turgeon was born in 1840 as one of nine children to Louis-Marc Turgeon and Ang√®le Labrecque. As a child, she made frequent visits to the church and felt a religious call which solidified as she grew older. Turgeon's father died when she was 15 and she remained in the care of her mother during this time. She would graduate from the Laval Normal School in Quebec in 1862 and taught at several schools after her graduation in places like Saint-Romuald and Saint-Roch. On 3 April 1875 at the invitation of Monsignor Jean Langevin (first bishop of Rimouski) she entered the Sisters of the Little Schools and made her profession of vows alongside twelve others on 12 September 1879. She established the Sisters of Our Lady of the Rosary on 12 September 1878 as the order's first superior and devoted all her work to mentorship and the institution of educational facilities in Rimouski. As she fell ill, she continued to direct the order and its functioning. Emergencies in her health on 23 March 1881 and 26 March led to her doctor and confessor being called in to perform medical examinations and the Anointing of the Sick. Bedridden, she was dying in August and the order led prayer vigils for her health. On 15 August, the Feast of the Assumption, she met with professed members of the order and the next day, she knew that her end was near. At 12:20am on 17 August, Turgeon died. Beatification The cause of beatification for Sister Turgeon was called for after her death and the Congregation of the Causes of Saints granted \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) which allowed for the title of Servant of God to be bestowed upon her. The Archdiocese of Rimouski was responsible for the diocesan process of the cause and submitted its work - the Positio - to Rome. The Congregation of the Causes of Saints then evaluated the documentation to assess whether or not Turgeon lived a virtuous life. Pope Francis recognized her life of heroic virtue and named her to be Venerable on 9 October 2013 and later recognized a miracle attributed to her on 17 September 2014. Her beatification was held in Rimouski on 26 April 2015.

The concession gave him control over Persian roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works in exchange for a stipulated sum for 5 years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. The concession was so immense that even imperialists like Lord Curzon characterized it as the most complete grant ever made of control of resources by any country to a foreigner.Curzon, Persia, p. 480. Local clergy were outraged by the concession and flyers were distributed in Tehran proclaiming that a Jew, Baron Reuter, would be in charge of country's affairs and that he plans to pass the railroad through the holy shrine in south Tehran. Clergy believed that this railroad plan is the work of Satan and would bring corruption to the Muslim lands.Iran's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook, Massoumeh Price. The concession was met with not only domestic outrage in the form of local protests, but the Russian government was also hostile towards the concession as well. Keddie, p. 5. Under immense pressure, Nasir al-Din Shah consequently canceled the agreement despite his deteriorating financial situation. The concession cancellation was also due to British government refusing to support Reuter's unrealistic ambitions. While the concession lasted for approximately a year, the entire debacle set the foundation for the revolts against the tobacco concession in 1890 as it demonstrated that any attempt by a foreign power to infringe upon Iranian sovereignty would infuriate the local population as well as rival European powers, in this case the Russian government, who had their own interests in the region.Lambton, Ann.

Throughout her life she suffered from debilitating diseases and was reportedly subject to various demonic possessions and visions. Her numerous visions were of Jesus Christ and through him saw Heaven while also receiving the stigmata herself. Bolognesi was beatified on 7 September 2013 and Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the behalf of Pope Francis. The beatification cause opened under Pope John Paul II in 1992 while Pope Benedict XVI had named her as Venerable in mid-2012. Life Maria Bolognesi was born as Maria Semiolo on 21 October 1924 in Rovigo to Giuseppe Samiolo. Her natural father - himself illegitimate - did not want to wed her mother and split from her which left Bolognesi to live until 1929 in her mother's home with her mother's name. Her maternal grandmother Cornetto Cesira was perhaps the most influential individual in her childhood in terms of instilling in the girl a religious education and love for God. Bolognesi received the name of her stepfather after her mother married Giuseppe Bolognesi in 1929; the pair went to live with him. Her step-grandfather was Luigi Bolognesi. In 1932 she ran a high fever and her mother at the same time had contracted meningitis and was on her deathbed. Bolognesi had begun to prepare for her First Communion at this time and the nun that was instructing her at the time told her that Jesus Christ would grant her a wish. She wished that her mother would recover and she managed to recover from the disease; Bolognesi went on to make her First Communion on 22 May 1932 with much emotion. Her stepfather often beat her mother due to his somewhat abrasive nature but he and her mother still had their son Luigi on 21 June 1940. In summer 1941 she received demonic possession and could not enter a church as a result with the blessings of priests failing to have an effect on her. She was at one stage even tied to a chair so that Father Santo Magro could bless her but this too failed. Bolognesi was taken to a mental hospital for evaluation but the Bishop of Rovigo Guido Maria Mazzocco blessed her from the window of his residence before she was taken there. The doctors later deemed her to be sane because she felt normal and was relieved of the possession. She grew up in a poor household and was able to attend the first and second grade of her initial schooling while her peers often marginalized her. She dropped out of school as a child in order to work to support her parents and siblings and worked as an agricultural laborer in order to achieve this. Bolognesi received her first vision of Jesus Christ in the evening of 1‚Äì2 April - on the occasion of Holy Thursday - bestowing upon her three rings and five rubies which was a representation of the Five Wounds. In the vision the Lord assured her that she would learn how to read and also promised her that her mother would turn from her sins - her mother began converting back to the faith on 15 March 1947. Around this time her spiritual director was the old priest Bassiano Paiato. On 8 May 1942 she had another vision of Christ. On 11 April 1942 she began to wear a black habit with the express permission of Father Paiato. Difficulties began to arise at this time for Father Magro became skeptical of her experiences and began to besmirch her in public to his parishioners. Difficulties escalated on 5 March 1948 when three male criminals attacked her while back on 27 February the Lord had warned her about this and told her that her guardian angel would be there with her. Bolognesi was knocked unconscious and was tied and muffled with flesh stripped from her legs and hands. She was left injured in the snow with two toenails almost torn off. Because people were skeptical of this the police sergeant took her to the magistrate and accused her of having faked the account though she was later absolved of these charges on 25 October 1948. In the 1940s she began to suffer from arthritis as well as suffering from both colitis and appendicitis while almost becoming blind in 1950. For treatment she would often have to go to Rovigo and Padua. Her new spiritual director from 28 June 1951 was Mgr. Rodolfo Barbieri and her first meeting with him was less than a month after. Bolognesi looked after orphans and assisted children whose parents were without jobs and would also make frequent visits to the sick in hospitals. In 1944 she gained the pierced wound on her side while in July 1951 suffering the pain of the Lord's flagellation; this culminated on 25 January 1954 when she wrote in her spiritual journal of a wound that had opened up in her right hand - the first signs of the stigmata. In August 1954 she resided with some Augustinian nuns in Ferrara and there received the wounds in her feet; she was hospitalized in February 1955 and had a vision telling her to leave Rovigo on 16 March. She went to a spiritual retreat in Sperlinga and received the left wound of the stigmata on 2 April 1955. En route back home from Sperlinga she stopped at San Giovanni Rotondo where she had a fever and her shoes full of blood. She found an inn and remained there and had a vision of Christ on Good Friday 8 April 1955 at 3:00pm. Barberi's poor health led to Mgr. Adelino Marenga becoming her new spiritual director on 24 September 1956 and she met him in their first meeting on the following 14 October. Bolognesi received a vision of Christ again at 3:00pm on 1 November 1957 in which He took her to see both Heaven and Purgatory and in spring 1958 was bedridden until 1959. She visited the tomb of Saint Gemma Galgani in Lucca on 29 September 1959 - to whom she fostered a devotion to. On 3 July 1959 she had another vision in which Christ said He would take her to Heaven and she saw it again on the following 6 July. She saw Heaven once again on 21 October 1959 at 2:00am in which she was roused from her sleep and then again on 22 January 1960. Marenga died in 1964 and her final spiritual director was Mgr. Aldo Balduin. Bolognesi suffered a heart attack in 1971. She had taken up painting in 1968 due to poor health that led to this heart attack. It was said that Padre Pio used to appear to her in bilocation in her Rovigo home even after the friar had died in 1968. Bolognesi died due to a heart attack on 30 January 1980 at 2:00am and her remains were later transferred to the parish of Bosaro. Beatification Bolognesi's tomb in Rovigo. The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 18 February 1992 in which she was titled as a Servant of God after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause in which it allowed for it to open on a diocesan level. The diocesan process opened on 21 October 1992 and concluded its work on 8 July 2000 before the C.C.S. validated the process in Rome on 25 May 2001 and received the official Positio dossier from the postulation later in 2007. The board of theologians met on two occasions on 19 February 2010 - in which another meeting was requested to discuss her writings and religious experiences - and on 24 June 2011 when definitive approval for the cause was issued. The C.C.S. met on 6 March 2012 and also approved the cause. On 10 May 2012 she was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that she had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The process for the miracle required for beatification was investigated - the healing of a man named Marco - from 23 September 2004 until 13 December 2005 and was issued validation on 18 May 2007 before receiving the approval of a medical board on 5 July 2012; theologians also approved this miracle on 17 November 2012 as did the C.C.S. on 9 April 2013. Pope Francis issued the final approval needed to the miracle - and her beatification - on 2 May 2013. Bolognesi was beatified in Rovigo on 7 September 2013 and Cardinal Angelo Amato presided on the pope's behalf. The current postulator assigned to the cause is the Rev. Raffaele Talmelli.

It was built from 1825 onwards. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 July 2010.  History  Watercolour painting of Moreton Bay Settlement, 1835 In May 1825 Lieutenant Henry Miller moved the Moreton Bay penal colony from the Redcliffe Peninsula to the northern bank of the Brisbane River. This was an elevated location with water holes and cooling breezes. The southern bank was a cliff of rock, suitable for building material, and a fertile flood plain. The settlers faced hardship and privation and the paucity of resources combined with thick sub-tropical vegetation made settlement difficult. Between 1826 and 1829, the number of prisoners in the settlement rose from 200 to 1000 and the plight of the convicts whose labour was to establish the settlement was dire. The site of Brisbane Town was an ongoing issue, with Commandant Patrick Logan proposing that the settlement be moved to Stradbroke Island. However, the difficulties of crossing the bay saw this plan abandoned. Logan continued to seek alternative sites, establishing a number of outstations including Eagle Farm and Oxley Creek. Despite the continued uncertainty about the future of Brisbane Town, building had continued under Commandant Logan, who is given credit for laying out the earliest permanent foundations. Logan was responsible for the building of Brisbane's only surviving convict-constructed buildings: the Commissariat Store and the Old Windmill. Convict numbers fell 75 percent between 1831 and 1838 by which time the area under cultivation shrank from to only . On 10 February 1842 Governor Gipps declared Moreton Bay open for Free Settlement. The Moreton Bay Penal Settlement during its 15 years of operation consisted of a range of buildings including barracks for convicts and troops, officers' quarters, dwellings for the Commandant, chaplain, Commissariat officer, surgeon, Commandant's clerk and engineer, a military and convict hospital, the Commissariat Store, and various stores, barns and sheds. The settlement also included a wharf, wells, a flagstaff, gardens and a lumber yard. The Commandant's cottage was constructed in 1825 on the site of the old Queensland Government Printing Office building (now the Public Service Club between William and George Streets. It was a wooden building with brick chimneys. In 1826 a detached brick building was built to the rear of the Commandant's house. A line of buildings ran from the Commandant's house to the first military barracks along present-day William Street. These buildings included the Engineer's cottage on the corner of William and Elizabeth Streets in what is now known as Queens Gardens. The cottage was associated with the first lumber yard on this block, which also contained engineer's stores and workshops. Plan of the Soldiers Barracks, bounded by Queen, George and William Streets The first military barracks were constructed in 1825 as two slab huts for the sergeant, corporal and 12 privates, and separate huts for the married couples on the corner of Queen Street and North Quay, site of the present Brisbane Square. The barracks were later moved to the other side of Queen Street and replaced by the second lumber yard in 1831. The first prisoner accommodation also consisted of slab huts, probably at the intersection of Queen and Albert Streets; stone barracks were constructed in 1829. The first Commissariat Store was constructed as a long, low slab building near the corner of Elizabeth and Albert Streets and was later used as a barn, after the stone Commissariat Store was built in 1829. The first Commissariat Store appears to have been situated within the alignment of the present day Elizabeth Street. The only entry point into the settlement was via the wharf on the Brisbane River. Initially known as the King's Wharf, or King's Jetty, it was constructed by 1827 when the boat crew's hut and boat builder's shed were first occupied. A crane was constructed on the end of the wharf in order to transfer goods from the arriving ships to the shore. The wharf was situated on the river bank opposite the Commissariat Store on Queen's Wharf Road. The main thoroughfare into the settlement was up the steep river bank following the present day alignment of Queen's Wharf Road. Pedestrians were able to enter the settlement through the vacant land immediately northwest of the Commissariat Store, in what is today known as Miller Park. A hospital was completed in 1827, after much government bungling over plans and approvals, on the block bounded by North Quay, Adelaide, George and Ann Streets, with the buildings extending into the current alignment of Adelaide Street. The windmill tower which still stands on Wickham Terrace was likely completed in late 1828, with a treadmill added before September 1829. Sketch of the Convict Barracks, Brisbane, 1832 West elevation of Prisoner's Barracks, circa 1839 Drawing showing sections of the Prisoners' Barracks, 1839 The Prisoners' Barracks were constructed between 1827 and 1830 to house up to 1000 convicts and was the largest stone building in the settlement at the time. The barracks were situated with the frontage along present-day Queen Street, on the block surrounded by Albert, Adelaide, George and Queen Streets. The barracks consisted of a multi-storey stone building with a central archway and a large walled yard to the rear. Several smaller buildings were situated in the yard on the far side of what would become Burnett Lane. Architectural plans for the Prison's Barrack building, 1839 The dominant archway of the Prisoners Barracks extended approximately through the building from the Queen Street frontage towards Adelaide Street opening into the large walled yard. The yard was the site of Moreton Bay's first public execution in 1830. Within the archway itself, strategically situated for all incoming and existing convicts to see, was the flogging triangle. Records indicate that in the period between February and October 1828 alone, over 11,000 lashes were inflicted on 200 convicts; this included 128 sentences of 50 or more lashes. The average in New South Wales was 41 lashes per sentence. The barracks were used from 1860 to 1868 as the court house and for Queensland's first Parliament. The barracks were demolished in 1880 with commercial redevelopment of the area in the early to mid-1880s particularly the buildings along Queen Street backing onto Burnett Lane, many of which are still extant (Manwaring Building, Gardams Building, Hardy Brothers Building, Edwards and Chapman Building, Colonial Mutual Chambers, Palings Building, Allan and Stark Building). Beside the Prisoners' Barracks, along the Queen Street alignment towards the river, a row of single-story brick buildings were erected. The functions of the six apartments of these buildings changed over time including use as the Commissariat Officer's residence, school room, guard house, Superintendent of Convicts' residence, gaol room, solitary cells, married soldiers' residences, and a military school. The Chaplain's house was constructed in 1828, halfway between the Commandant's house and the Engineer's cottage, on the site now occupied by the former Lands Administration Building (now Treasury Hotel) between William and George Streets. Described in 1829 as a handsome brick house, it was later divided into two dwellings, and occupied at various times by the Assistant Surgeon and the Commissariat Officer. The Government Gardens were established in 1828 to the southwest of the settlement on the site of the present day City Botanic Gardens on Alice Street. The garden was under the charge of the Superintendent of Agriculture and produced a wide range of vegetables including cabbage, cauliflower, peas, beans, potatoes and pumpkins, as well as fruit trees and plants such as banana, pineapple, citrus, and apple. The Gardener's house, octagonal in shape and consisting of three rooms surrounded by verandahs, was also situated in the gardens. The route of the roadway along the western end of the settlement from the Prisoners' Barracks to the Government Gardens overlaps with the current Albert Street on the block between Margaret and Alice Streets. The new Commissariat Store, Brisbane was constructed in 1828 and 1829, on its site between present day William Street and Queens Wharf Road. The two story utilitarian building was constructed of local porphyry and sandstone, with its ground and second floor doors opening towards the river and the wharf. Used for various stores and government purposes over its history, it is one of only two extant structures from the convict period. One of the major thoroughfares of the settlement, taken by Allan Cunningham in his 1829 survey, ran along the rear of the Prisoners Barracks towards a pathway up to the windmill tower and to the Kangaroo Point Road. The alignment of this pathway follows the current alignment of Adelaide Street, from George Street to Albert Street, where the original pathway crossed Wheat Creek. Layout of Brisbane Town, circa 1839 Additional hospital accommodation was erected in 1830/31 adjacent to the existing hospital, situated between present day North Quay and George Street. This included a cottage for the Medical Officer and a building to serve as the Military Hospital. The new Military Barracks were also constructed in 1831. Designed for 100 rank and file, the barracks compound also included a guard house and a dwelling for two subaltern officers. The barracks were constructed on what is today the Treasury Building (Treasury Casino) while the former barracks site (situated at Brisbane Square) was converted to the lumber yard. Architectural drawings of the hospital and the quarters of surgeon Dr David Keith Ballow, 1838 In 1839, in preparation for the opening of Moreton Bay to free settlement, surveyors were sent from Sydney to draw maps of the district and prepare town plans so the land could be put up for sale. The town plan undertaken by Robert Dixon (Plan MT3, DERM 1840) is based on an earlier 1839 plan but superimposes the proposed street plan for the free town of Brisbane with square blocks of . Additional features depicted in these plans include a well situated in what is now George Street, near the intersection with Burnett Lane; a flagstaff in the centre of what is now William Street, close to the northwest boundary of Miller Park; and a range of gardens. The garden areas included military gardens and Dixon's garden behind the Military Barracks in the block bounded by Queen, George, Elizabeth and Albert Streets; Whyte's garden to the northwest of the Prisoners Barracks, through which Burnett Lane now runs; Handt's garden and Kent's garden to the rear of the Chaplain's house and Commandant's house, today overlain by parts of Elizabeth, George and Charlotte Streets; the Commandant's garden adjacent to the Commissariat Store along William Street and down towards Alice Street; and Paget's garden and Dr Ballard's garden adjacent to the Hospital, in the location of George and Ann Streets. Barns and a piggery indicated on Dixon's 1840 plan appear to have been situated within the current alignment of Charlotte Street. A plan of Brisbane Town drawn by draftsman H. W. Marriott on 24 March 1840 was forwarded to the New South Wales Surveyor-General by Surveyor Henry Wade on 26 April 1842. This plan was ranked #48 in the ‚ÄòTop 150: Documenting Queensland‚Äô exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010. The exhibition was part of Queensland State Archives‚Äô events and exhibition program which contributed to the state‚Äôs Q150 celebrations, marking the 150th anniversary of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales. On 10 February 1842 Governor George Gipps declared the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement closed and the district open for free settlement. A number of revised plans for the town were made, particularly after a visit by Governor Gipps, with the 1843 plan by surveyor Henry Wade (Plan MT8, DERM 1843) being the one adopted as the present day plan of the Brisbane CBD. Only three other places within the Brisbane CBD dating to the penal settlement period are entered in the Queensland Heritage Register: * The Old Windmill * the Commissariat Store, Brisbane * the City Botanic Gardens Archaeological investigations at the Commissariat Store, Old Windmill and 40 Queen Street (Brisbane Square) have identified archaeological remains dating to the penal period. The original cemetery site at Skew Street is also well known as is the children's burial site at North Quay. The remnants of the original Commandant's House were also unearthed in the mid 1980s without any archaeological investigation.

All roads are modern bituminised surfaces with white and yellow line markings. All roads are kerbed and channelled with either concrete or porphyry stone blocks in the kerbing, and concreted gutters. The road reserves include the footpaths which consist of a range of surfacing materials including brick paving, concrete and bitumen. =Burnett Lane= Burnett Lane is a narrow street that runs between George Street and Albert Street between and parallel to Adelaide Street and Queen Street. It is Brisbane's oldest laneway and is named after James Charles Burnett, one of Queensland's earliest surveyors. During the penal colony years, it was used as a prison exercise yard and for floggings and hangings. Later it became the tradesmen's entrance to buildings fronting Queen and Adelaide Streets. In 2008 Brisbane City Council announced that Burnett Lane would be refurbished and integrated into the Queen Street Mall precinct, resulting the lane developing into a popular cafe and bar precinct, but delivery vehicles pose a problem for pedestrians in this narrow street. 1844 map Map of Brisbane, 1844 =Map legend=  Heritage listing  Early Streets of Brisbane was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 July 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The Early Streets of Brisbane have the potential to contain archaeological artefacts that are an important source of information about Queensland's history. Potential subsurface remains will demonstrate the establishment, evolution and pattern of settlement of early Brisbane as a penal colony. Evidence of this first European occupation of Brisbane is extremely rare given the substantial development into a modern city. Archaeological remains associated with the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement will provide evidence and understanding of a particular type of place - that of colonial penal settlements - this being the first and only example of its type in Queensland. Survey plans of the initial settlement overlaid with the proposed (and current) street plan exist, enabling the clear identification of locations of the early settlement structures. Although the current alignment of Queen Street remains substantially the same as its original, the current street plan alignment overlaps with allotments from the penal settlement period. This leads to a high potential for the remains of buildings being situated within the current street alignments. The construction of Brisbane's streets has seen a deposition and build-up of layers rather than being cut down and removed, thereby preserving earlier cultural deposits. This was evident during work undertaken for the construction of Queens Plaza on the corner of Queen and Edward Streets in 2003 which clearly demonstrated the buildup of layers in the stratigraphic profile of Queen Street. The streets therefore are the least disturbed areas in the Brisbane Central Business District (CBD) with the most potential for the presence of the earliest remains of Queensland's European settlement. The Streets have the potential for subsurface remains of the full range of activities occurring in the penal settlement related to the Prisoners Barracks, Commandant's House and Office, Commissariat Store and Office, Officer's Quarters, and Military Barracks, Military and Convict Hospitals, other dwellings, gardens, stores and barns. The archaeological investigation of the Early Streets of Brisbane has the potential to provide information about unmapped buildings and features, and to provide information about the use of mapped structures whose purpose is historically unknown. The remains of buildings, features and other artefacts have the potential to provide insight into the material culture and life ways of the convicts, soldiers and administrators of the penal settlement. They also have the potential to provide an insight into the social divisions between these groups, and the social development of early Queensland. This will contribute information to the collective understanding of convict sites around Australia and the place of Queensland in the system of forced migration and punishment of the 18th and 19th centuries. Given the accumulation of material from the initial European settlement of Brisbane to the present day, there is also the potential for archaeological remains from subsequent periods to be recovered. This will contribute to the full history of development of Queensland's capital city of Brisbane. The Early Streets of Brisbane have been assessed as part of the Brisbane City CBD Archaeological Plan as being \\"Exceedingly Rare\\" given their association with the penal settlement phase of Brisbane. The level of disturbance has been designated as \\"Intact\\" given the minor subsurface works undertaken and the tendency for accumulation of deposits when constructing or renewing road surfaces. This combination of being designated \\"exceedingly rare\\" and \\"intact\\" leads to the categorisation of the Early Streets of Brisbane as having \\"Exceptional Archaeological Research Potential\\". Being the least disturbed areas of the Brisbane City CBD with high potential for the earliest remains of the colony's establishment, archaeological investigation of the Early Streets of Brisbane has the potential to answer important research questions critical to Queensland's history. Such questions could focus on but are not limited to the identification of the locations and purposes of previously undocumented penal settlement buildings, questions of social status, individual and collective living conditions, and an understanding of the processes of forced migration and punishment.

After retiring in 1999 as the President and Senior Scientist at Applied Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Inc, Sticht conducted workshops and lectures on adult education and professional development.  Research  Sticht created Functional Context Training for the U.S. Military.Functional Context Training His biggest contribution has been his research on improving the literacy skills for the new recruits of the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force. Functional Context education is defined as instructional strategy that integrates the teaching of literacy skills and job content to move learner more successfully and quickly toward their education and employment goals.Wider Opportunities for Women, 2009.Functional Context education He later developed a training program to elevate literary skills in adult learners. Functional context training stresses on building upon prior knowledge to construct new concepts to accomplish difficult tasks. Sticht proposed that instructors should formulate better learning environments that incorporate real world situations to increase students' performance. Sticht contributed to the field of Functional Context theory where he proposed that it was vital to make learning relevant to learners. The model of Cognitive system consisted of three components: #Knowledge based (prior knowledge of the learner) #Processing skills (problem solving, language skills, and learning strategies) #Information displays that present information. The Functional Context approach recommends new assessment methods such as measuring functional learning and academic learning. As a researcher, Sticht contributed to the research of early childhood education, and conducted the first conference on intergenerational transfer of cognitive skills. Many articles were published by him on the role of oral language and the transfer of literacy.

The Fairbanks-based troopers, Sergeant Patrick Scott Johnson and Trooper Gabriel Lenox Rich, had been featured in the National Geographic Channel program Alaska State Troopers. Nineteen-year-old Tanana resident Nathanial Lee Kangas was charged with two counts of first- degree murder and a single count of third-degree assault. Events Kangas shot and killed the officers as they attempted to arrest his father, Arvin Kangas, at the family's home. Arvin Kangas, 58, was charged with assault for pointing a shotgun at the local Village Public Safety Officer (VPSO) during the incident that prompted the troopers' investigation. Aftermath On May 5, the chairman of the Tanana Tribal Council issued a statement expressing the council's shock and grief and offering condolences to the families of the officers, stating, \\"We want them to know that this was the action of individuals and that this was not, and is not, Tanana.\\" Later that week, the tribal council voted unanimously to ban the elder Kangas and another resident from the community for their indirect roles in the deaths of the officers. Nathanial Kangas was tried in May 2016 in Fairbanks for the deaths of troopers Johnson and Rich, and was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of third-degree assault for pointing a weapon at a VPSO, and one count of tampering with evidence. He was sentenced in November to 203 years in prison (99 for the death of each trooper, 5 for evidence tampering). Arvin Kangas was convicted in May 2015 of three counts of evidence tampering (two for altering the position of the troopers' weapons, one for disposing of marijuana plants) and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, 8 of which must be served.

It is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia, widespread in most of its range but only known from nine populations. Description Calectasia obtusa is an undershrub with stilt roots 30-55 mm long but no rhizome. It grows to a height of about 50 cm with several short side branches. Each leaf blade is glabrous except at the margins, 4.5-8.5 x 0.5-0.9 mm, often pressed against the stem, the ends usually blunt and only rarely tapering to a short, sharp point. The base of the petals (strictly tepals) form a tube 7.7-8.8 mm long, while the outer part of the petals are wine red with blue margins fading to pale blue with age and spreading outwards to form a papery, star-like pattern. In the centre of the star are six yellow stamens forming a tube which does not change colour with age. The thin style extends beyond the stamens. It is similar to the other species of Calectasia and is distinguished from them mainly by the combination of the absence of a rhizome and the glabrousness and lack of a sharp point on the ends of the leaf blades. Flowers mostly appear from July to August. Taxonomy and naming Calectasia obtusa is one of eleven species in the genus Calectasia. It was described as a new species in 2001 by R.L. Barrett and K.W. Dixon from a specimen collected near Cape Riche. is from the Latin obtusus, \\"obtuse\\" referring to the blunt tip of the leaf. Distribution and habitat This species of tinsel lily is found in scattered populations, sometimes of only a few plants, between Kojonup and Hopetoun in the South West Botanical Province. It grows in grey clay loam in open woodland or in near-coastal areas, in low heath over laterite. Conservation status Calectasia obtusa is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian government department of parks and wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

Stockwell was arrested by the police in Great Yarmouth four days later. He admitted at his subsequent trial that he had stolen ¬£90 of the cinema's takings and attacked Hoard when the latter tried to stop him removing a suitcase in which it was hidden. Stockwell was found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged at Pentonville Prison, which he was on 14 November 1934. Murderer's background Stockwell was born in Manchester on 31 March 1915. His father, also named John Stockwell, was killed in November 1915 during the Gallipoli Campaign while serving with the Manchester Regiment. Stockwell's mother died soon after, and he spent the rest of his childhood and youth in various Salvation Army orphanages. Events of 7 August 1934 On the morning of 7 August 1934, Dudley Henry Hoard, manager of the Eastern Palace Cinema on Bow Road, London, was attacked by an axe after answering the door. He received fourteen blows to the head and was left for dead. Cleaners later arrived at the cinema and found the partially clothed body of Hoard, with multiple wounds and fractures to the skull. Hoard's wife, Maisie, was found alive but unconscious with a wound to her head. After being taken to hospital, she described the attacker as a young man of about 19. The following day police found a bloodied axe in a storage room behind the stage. A bloody thumbprint, identified as being made by somebody other than Hoard, was found on one of the walls. Hoard's body was taken to his mother's home in Croydon and he was buried at Croydon Cemetery on 13 August. Investigation On 10 August police in Lowestoft received a letter confessing to Hoard's murder at 7:40 am on 7 August, signed J. F. Stockwell. John Stockwell, a 19-year-old employee at the Eastern Palace Cinema, had not been a suspect as 7 August was his day off. His clothes, wristwatch, Post Office savings book, and an apparent suicide note were found on a Lowestoft beach later that day. However, holidaymakers had spotted a young man placing the clothes on the beach and notified police when news of the confession letter was made public. The following day a young man fitting Stockwell's description checked into the Metropolitan Hotel in Great Yarmouth. He aroused the suspicion of the hotel manager by giving his address as Luton, Hertfordshire, whereas Luton is in Bedfordshire. When Stockwell arrived back at the hotel after a shopping expedition he was confronted by Yarmouth police and taken into custody for questioning. A large crowd had gathered at Bow Road waiting for him, though only around 30 remained when he arrived. Trial and execution Stockwell was charged with murder and brought before the Thames Magistrates' Court on 13 August. He did not enter a plea and was remanded until 21 August. At his next appearance he admitted to stealing ¬£90 from the cinema takings and hiding it in a suitcase on the premises. On the morning of 7 August he arrived at the cinema claiming to have left some personal money there the night before, and asked Hoard if he could look for it. When Stockwell tried to retrieve the case, Hoard tried to stop him. Stockwell then hit Hoard several times with an axe he had concealed under his coat. Mrs Hoard came to investigate the noise. Stockwell hit her once before hiding the axe and fleeing with the money. On 22 October 1934 Stockwell formally pleaded guilty to the charge of murder. He was sentenced to death by hanging and executed at HM Prison Pentonville a few weeks later, on 14 November.

University of Colorado, Denver Markle was highly trained in her field, and had a long and distinguished career. Some of her accomplishments are: * Researcher at B.F. Skinner's laboratory 1956‚Äì1960 * Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) * Professor of Psychology and Director of Instructional Resources at the University of Illinois at Chicago, 1965‚Äì1993 * Director of Programing for the Center for Programed Instruction, Inc. * Member of the National Society of Performance and Instruction * Member of the International Society for Performance Improvement Research While she was an associate of B.F. Skinner in the early years of her life, Markle focused on the design process, and many of her ideas are clearly influenced by his work. In her book Designs for Instructional Designers, Markle outlined and described three basic principles of instructional programming. Following is a synopsis of what these principles entail. * The learner learns what he or she does, which Markle labels \\"active responding\\". She specifies that a significant part of learning occurs within the learner's head, that is, covert processes that cannot be seen. In order to determine that learning has therefore occurred, the instructor must have empirical evidence, that is, overt behaviors that can be measured. * In the second principle, described as \\"errorless\\" learning, Markle posits that although only the learner learns, the instructor, or designer, or programmer, fosters learning through the wise selection of instructional designs. * The final principle is \\"immediate feedback\\", and is essentially based on the reinforcement theory of instructional design. Markle establishes her that \\"immediate reinforcers\\" are used in shaping behaviors, very similar to Skinner's operant techniques. In her book, Markle underscores the notion that good designs require time and thought to develop.Meyer Markle, S. (1978, 1983, 1990). Designs for instructional designers. Champaign, Illinois: Stipes Publishing Company. Retrieved from www.ame-learning.com Later in her life, Markle collaborated with her husband Philip Tiemann to develop and expand on her earlier idea that programming was a process. They developed a detailed procedural flow chart which consisted of, among other things, analyses of learning and learning tasks. They also examined the place that specific objectives had in the learning process, and the need for active practice and feedback.Silber, K.H. & Foshay, W.R. (2010). Handbook for improving performance in the workplace, Vol. 1: Instructional design and training delivery. San Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer.

These include motor responses, complex chains of responding, basic verbal discrimination, conceptual responding, and novel behavior.Johnson D.A.

Retrieved from rmack-mx.org In addition, Markle, again working with Tiemann, developed what was known as the three columns of learning outcomes, which are based on the kind of skill that the learner acquires in each. These columns are: * Psychomotor column - where the learner learns to respond. The emphasis is on the exact form of the response. * Single cognitive column - which involves simple stimulus-response relationships that focus on when the response occurs. * Complex cognitive column - the ability to respond to new or novel situations.Tiemann, P.W. & Markle, S.M.

The race is traditionally seen as the beginning of the cobbled classics season along with the Kuurne‚ÄìBrussels‚ÄìKuurne the following day. It was rated as a 1.HC race as part of the 2015 UCI Europe Tour. The race took place on 28 February 2015, starting and finishing in the city of Ghent. Ian Stannard (), the defending champion from 2014, won the race in a two-man sprint ahead of Niki Terpstra (). Terpstra's teammate Tom Boonen was third.  Preview  The Omloop Het Nieuwsblad is held over a challenging, hilly course, similar in style to the Tour of Flanders, one of the cycling monuments and the most important cycling race in Flanders. The Het Nieuwsblad is, however, significantly shorter at . The races share many climbs in the race, such as the Taaienberg, the Valkenberg and the Molenberg; the Het Nieuwsblad also includes the Muur van Geraardsbergen, which was a decisive part of the Tour of Flanders until its removal in 2012. The race is normally won from a small group rather than from a bunch sprint because of the difficult route. The 2015 race included a new climb, the Kaperij, after . The route of the 2015 Omloop Het Nieuwsblad The race is also notable for the weather: it is frequently held in rain and cold conditions, which adds to the difficulty. The weather has caused the cancellation of the race ‚àí and also of Kuurne‚ÄìBrussels‚ÄìKuurne the following day ‚àí on several occasions, and the riders have to pay considerable attention to keeping warm during the race. This is especially true because many of the riders used hot-weather races in the Middle East (such as the Tour of Qatar, the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Oman) to prepare for the European classics season. The importance of this was demonstrated in 2014, when Ian Stannard () beat Greg Van Avermaet () in a sprint principally because he had managed to keep warmer through the race. As the opening day of the Belgian cycling season, the Het Nieuwsblad has a particular prominence for Belgian cyclists. 54 of the 69 previous editions had been won by Belgian cyclists, though the victory of Sep Vanmarcke () in 2012 was the only Belgian win in the past six years. Pre-race favourites included Stannard, Vanmarcke, Niki Terpstra (), and Alexander Kristoff (). Tom Boonen () was also considered a favourite, despite the fact that the Het Nieuwsblad was the only cobbled classic that he had not won. Much pre-race coverage also focused on the participation of Bradley Wiggins (), the former champion of the Tour de France, who was participating in the event for the first time since 2006 as part of his preparation for the Paris‚ÄìRoubaix.  Teams  23 teams were selected to take part in the race. As a 1.HC event, the race organisers could invite up UCI ProTeams to make up 70% of the line-up; however, only 10 ProTeams were invited, along with 13 Professional Continental teams. Each team was limited to eight riders, for a maximum field of 184 riders.  Race overview  An early breakaway was formed by Alexis Gougeard (), Matt Brammeier (), Christophe Laborie (), Michael Reihs (), Kevin Van Melsen (), Louis Verhelst (), Jaroslaw Marycz (), Sean De Bie () and Albert Timmer (). They broke away from the pack in the first and built a six-minute lead. The main group did not take up the chase in earnest until after they had passed the Muur van Geraardsbergen with remaining, when , and took control. Bradley Wiggins and Bernhard Eisel (both ) spent a lot of time on the front of the main peloton, reducing both the lead of the group ahead and the size of the main pack. Tom Boonen () put in an attack on the Taaienberg (as he had done in many previous editions of the race) and briefly formed a small leading group, but the pack reformed soon afterwards. Luke Rowe () attacked and joined with Brammeier and Timmer, the only remaining riders in the breakaway; Stijn Vandenbergh () led the peloton in chasing this move down. The victory ceremony The key moment of the race came on the cobbled section at the cobbled section at Haaghoek with remaining and across the Leberg later. Vandenbergh and Boonen both put in attacks, as did Sep Vanmarcke (). Vanmarcke then suffered a puncture, and only four riders remained at the front of the race: Vandenbergh, Boonen and Niki Terpstra from and Ian Stannard (). The three riders led the group, with Stannard following their wheels rather than putting any effort into leading. A group behind was formed by Vanmarcke, Greg Van Avermaet () and Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar (), which meant that the lead group had to ride hard to maintain their lead. At one point, Boonen gained a small lead across a cobbled section, but Stannard was able to bring the group back together. The chasing group came close to catching the leaders, but Vandenbergh's work prevented this and the four riders came into the final together. With three riders in the lead group, were heavy favourites to win the race. Tom Boonen was the first to put in an attack, from the finish. Stannard put in a measured response and was able to catch him; Terpstra then immediately put in another attack. He was caught by his own teammate, Vandenbergh; this incident caused significant confusion after the race. Stannard was the freshest rider in the group, as he had not needed to put any significant effort in the previous section of the race, and he attacked inside the final ; only Tersptra was able to hold his wheel. Since Boonen was never more than five seconds behind the pair, Stannard did most of the work until the last , when Terpstra passed in front of him. Terpstra was the first to start the sprint; Stannard was able to sit behind him and come past in the final as Terpstra began to fade. Stannard therefore won his second successive Omloop Het Nieuwsblad with Terpstra second. Boonen finished third, eight seconds behind, with Vandenbergh fourth. Many riders and observers were surprised that Stannard had managed to overcome the numerical disadvantage to win the race. Patrick Lefevere (manager of ) was annoyed at Stannard's failure to work with his riders in the finale, while Boonen regretted having attacked, suggesting that waiting for a sprint would have been a more effective way to win the race. Stannard attributed his victory in part to the difficult tactical situation faced, with a strong group only a few seconds behind for a long period of racing.

It was adapted into a TV series of the same name in 2015.  Plot  Vampires were once hunted to extinction, but for the last 200 years there‚Äôs a peace treaty between humans and vampires. Now vampires are living amongst the humans hiding their nature by drinking only pig blood. However, vampires are still predators by nature and still desire human blood. This is a story about a vampire named Baek Ma-ri, who tries to conceal her identity from the world. Seeing vampires as monsters, the humans shun them and wish that they would die out already. Until one day, Jae-min's sweet-smelling blood made Ma-ri lose control of herself, resulting in a new sweet beginning.  Characters  *; Baek Ma-ri : Ma-ri is the female protagonist of the story. She is a vampire trying to conceal her real identity from the world. In the beginning, Ma-ri is shown to be very quiet and lacking in emotion. She also turned down multiple boys without hesitation, thus earning her the nickname \\"Ice Princess\\". Despite this fact, she is still one of the more sought after girls. It's revealed that her aversion to forming relationships is due to the fact that at her last school she was ridiculed when her friends found out she was a vampire. Ma-ri's life all starts to turn around when Jae-min's sweet-smelling blood made her lose control of herself, resulting in biting his neck. After this incident, Jae-min began to have interest on her and kept chasing her, she slowly develops a love interest for him. Later on the story, she and Jae-min finally started dating. *; Jung Jae-min : Jae-min is the male protagonist of the story. He is charming and an extremely skilled basketball player. He is one of the most popular boys in school but he cares the least. Jae-min is shown as a misogynist but the reason isn't that he really hates women. In truth, he hates their touch as it reminds him of his stepmother who used to beat him up for everything. His life started to turn around when his sweet-smelling blood made Ma-ri lose control of herself, resulting in biting his neck. After this incident, he has been confused of his feelings and kept on chasing her to try to make the situation clear, even joining the Band Club. As the story progress, he falls in love with Ma-ri and cares for her the most. He is ready to beat anyone who hurts her. He is seen to be smiling more when he is with Ma-ri. He asked her to never leave his side. Later on the story he and Ma-ri finally started dating. *; Jung Soo-ri : Soo-ri is Ma-ri's first friend. Initially not thinking much about Ma-ri, she became entranced by her guitar playing after witnessing it by chance, and persistently tries to get her to join the band club. Soo-ri was originally openly hostile about vampires, even openly badmouthing them in front of Ma-ri while having no idea she was a vampire. After Ma-ri saves her life, getting injured in the process, Soo-ri's entire opinion of vampires is changed and she becomes protective of Ma-ri, even standing up for her when Ah-ra found out. Soo-ri's mother is ill with cancer and she's constantly worried about her. : Even though they have the same surname, Soo-ri isn't related to Jung Jae-min in any way. *; Do Woo-mi : Woo-mi is Ma-ri's second friend, via Soo-ri. When she found out Ma-ri was a vampire, she accepted her without hesitation. However, she grew a bit scared of her after witnessing Si-hoo drinking Chae-rin's blood, even more so after an incident where a vampire seemed to have attacked and killed someone. That incident was later revealed to be a hoax by some anti-vampire criminals, but Woo-mi was still timid with Ma-ri for awhile. After Ma-ri's identity as a vampire was revealed to the school, Woo-mi regretfully watched as Ma-ri was ridiculed and bullied, but eventually overcame her fears and regrets and befriended Ma-ri again. *; Jo Ah-ra : Ah-ra is the antagonist of the story. She saw Ma-ri as her rival for Jae-min. She constantly tried to intimidate Ma- ri, but all her attempts failed miserably. Ah-ra finds out Ma-ri is a vampire and tries to use this against her, but she was stopped by Si-hoo. Later, she joined the Band Club. She begins to be nicer towards Ma-ri after this, but still tries to steal Jae-min from her. When the whole school finds out that Ma-ri is a vampire, Ah-ra becomes very protective of her, as shown when she took Chae-rin's phone when she tried to report Ma-ri to the Vampire Reporting Center and threatened to wipe Chae-rin off the face of the planet if she hurt Ma-ri. She seemed to care for Ma-ri at the end of the season, but usually denies it. *; Han Si-hoo : Si-hoo is Ma-ri's fiancee who was later introduced in the story. Due to the shortage of vampires, he and Ma-ri were arranged to be married since they were both very young. He thinks highly of himself. He doesn't trust humans at all, believing they're nothing more than food and that no human, not even Ma-ri's friends, will ever accept vampires or that that will ever change, despite mounting evidence to the contrary. He doesn't hesitate to badmouth humans every chance he gets. Yet, he also seems to have a caring side, as he defended Ma-ri when Ah-ra threatens to tell the whole school that Ma-ri is a vampire. When Ah-ra joins the Band Club, he joins too in order to protect Ma-ri from her. He likes Ma-ri and hence gets agitated when Jae-min hurt her feelings and made her cry. He later on confessed that he liked Ma-ri and asked her what does she like about Jae-min to be going out with a human even though she is a vampire. Si-hoo is also known to have drank the blood of Chae-rin, who self-proclaims herself to be his girlfriend, but he later reveals he never had any emotional attachment to her. Near the end of the story, he goes on a binge drinking his entire supply of human blood, causing his long-dormant vulnerability to sunlight to resurface, forcing him to cover himself in bandages to protect himself from the sunlight. At the end of the story, he and Chae-rin disappeared as he claims that his kind of vampire is no longer allowed to exist. *; Ha Na-bi : Na-bi is Ma-ri's aunt. She owns a cafe where Ma-ri sometimes sings and plays guitar. She is friends with Jae-min's mother.

According to the sliding filament theory, the myosin (thick) filaments of muscle fibers slide past the actin (thin) filaments during muscle contraction, while the two groups of filaments remain at relatively constant length. It was independently introduced in 1954 by two research teams, one consisting of Andrew F. Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke from the University of Cambridge, and the other consisting of Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was originally conceived by Hugh Huxley in 1953. Andrew Huxley and Niedergerke introduced it as a \\"very attractive\\" hypothesis. Before the 1950s there were several competing theories on muscle contraction, including electrical attraction, protein folding, and protein modification. The novel theory directly introduced a new concept called cross-bridge theory (classically swinging cross-bridge, now mostly referred to as cross-bridge cycle) which explains the molecular mechanism of sliding filament. Cross-bridge theory states that actin and myosin form a protein complex (classically called actomyosin) by attachment of myosin head on the actin filament, thereby forming a sort of cross-bridge between the two filaments. The sliding filament theory is a universally accepted explanation of the mechanism that underlies muscle contraction. History =Early works= The first muscle protein discovered was myosin by a German scientist Willy K√ºhne, who extracted and named it in 1864. In 1939 a Russian husband and wife team Vladimir Alexandrovich Engelhardt and Militsa Nikolaevna Lyubimova discovered that myosin had an enzymatic (called ATPase) property that can breakdown ATP to release energy. Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi, a Hungarian physiologist, turned his focus on muscle physiology after winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1937 for his works on vitamin C and fumaric acid. He demonstrated in 1942 that ATP was the source of energy for muscle contraction. He actually observed that muscle fibres containing myosin B shortened in the presence of ATP, but not with myosin A, the experience which he later described as \\"perhaps the most thrilling moment of my life.\\" With Brun√≥ Ferenc Straub, he soon found that myosin B was associated with another protein, which they called actin, while myosin A was not. Straub purified actin in 1942, and Szent-Gy√∂rgyi purified myosin A in 1943. It became apparent that myosin B was a combination of myosin A and actin, so that myosin A retained the original name, whereas they renamed myosin B as actomyosin. By the end of the 1940s Szent-Gy√∂rgyi's team had postulated with evidence that contraction of actomyosin was equivalent to muscle contraction as a whole. But the notion was generally opposed, even from the likes of Nobel laureates such as Otto Fritz Meyerhof and Archibald Hill, who adhered to the prevailing dogma that myosin was a structural protein and not a functional enzyme. However, in one of his last contributions to muscle research, Szent-Gy√∂rgyi demonstrated that actomyosin driven by ATP was the basic principle of muscle contraction. = Origin = Structure of muscle fibre (sarcomere) under electron microscope with schematic explanation By the time Hugh Huxley earned his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1952 on his research on the structure of muscle, Szent-Gy√∂rgyi had turned his career into cancer research. Huxley went to Francis O. Schmitt's laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a post-doctoral fellowship in September 1952, where he was joined by another English post-doctoral fellow Jean Hanson in January 1953. Hanson had a PhD in muscle structure from King's College, London in 1951. Huxley had used X-ray diffraction to speculate that muscle proteins, particularly myosin, form structured filaments giving rise to sarcomere (a segment of muscle fibre). Their main aim was to use electron microscopy to study the details of those filaments as never done before. They soon discovered and confirmed the filament nature of muscle proteins. Myosin and actin form overlapping filaments, myosin filaments mainly constituting the A band (the dark region of a sarcomere), while actin filaments traverse both the A and I (light region) bands. Huxley was the first to suggest the sliding filament theory in 1953, stating: Later, in 1996, Huxley regretted that he should have included Hanson in the formulation of his theory because it was based on their collaborative work. Andrew Huxley, whom Alan Hodgkin described as \\"wizard with scientific apparatus\\", had just discovered the mechanism of the nerve impulse (action potential) transmission (for which he and Hodgkin later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963) in 1949 using his own design of voltage clamp, and was looking for an associate who could properly dissect out muscle fibres. Upon recommendation of a close friend Robert St√§mpfli, a German physician Rolf Niedergerke joined him at the University of Cambridge in 1952. By then he realised that the conventionally used phase-contrast microscope was not suitable for fine structures of muscle fibres, and thus developed his own interference microscope. Between March 1953 and January 1954 they executed their research. Huxley recollected that at the time the only person who ever thought of sliding filaments before 1953 was Dorothy Hodgkin (later winner of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry). He spent the summer of 1953 at Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to use electron microscope there. There he met Hugh Huxley and Hanson with whom he shared data and information on their works. They parted with an agreement that they would keep in touch, and when their aim is achieved, they would publish together, if they ever \\"reached similar conclusions\\". The sliding filament theory Diagrammatic explanation of sliding filament hypothesis The sliding filament theory was born from two consecutive papers published on the 22 May 1954 issue of Nature under the common theme \\"Structural Changes in Muscle During Contraction\\". Though their conclusions were fundamentally similar, their underlying experimental data and propositions were different. =Huxley- Niedergerke hypothesis= The first paper, written by Andrew Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke, is titled \\"Interference microscopy of living muscle fibres\\". It was based on their study of frog muscle using interference microscope, which Andrew Huxley developed for the purpose. According to them: #the I bands are composed of actin filaments, and the A bands principally of myosin filaments; and #during contraction, the actin filaments move into the A bands between the myosin filaments. =Huxley-Hanson hypothesis= The second paper, by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson, is titled \\"Changes in the cross-striations of muscle during contraction and stretch and their structural interpretation\\". It is more elaborate and was based on their study of rabbit muscle using phase contrast and electron microscopes. According to them: #the backbone of a muscle fibre is actin filaments which extend from Z line up to one end of H zone, where they are attached to an elastic component which they named S filament; #myosin filaments extend from one end of the A band through the H zone up to the other end of the A band; #myosin filaments remain in relatively constant length during muscle stretch or contraction; #if myosin filaments contract beyond the length of the A band, their ends fold up to form contraction bands; #myosin and actin filaments lie side-by-side in the A band and in the absence of ATP they do not form cross-linkages; #during stretching, only the I bands and H zone increase in length, while A bands remain the same; #during contraction, actin filaments move into the A bands and the H zone is filled up, the I bands shorten, the Z line comes in contact with the A bands; and #the possible driving force of contraction is the actin-myosin linkages which depend on ATP hydrolysis by the myosin. Reception and consequences In spite of strong evidence, the sliding filament theory did not gain any support for several years to come. Szent-Gy√∂rgyi himself refused to believe that myosin filaments were confined to the thick filament (A band). F.O. Schmitt, whose electron microscope provided the best data, also remained sceptical of the original images. There were also immediate arguments as to the organisation of the filaments, whether the two sets (myosin and actin) of filaments were merely overlapping or continuous. It was only with the new electron microscope that Hugh Huxley confirmed the overlapping nature of the filaments in 1957. It was also from this publication that the existence of actin-myosin linkage (now called cross-bridge) was clearly shown. But he took another five years to provide evidence that the cross-bridge was a dynamic interaction between actin and myosin filaments. He obtained the actual molecular arrangement of the filaments using X-ray crystallography by teaming up with Kenneth Holmes, who was trained by Rosalind Franklin, in 1965. It was only after a conference in 1972 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where the theory and its evidence were deliberated, that it became generally accepted. At the conference, as Koscak Maruyama later recalled, Hanson had to answer the criticisms by shouting, \\"I know I cannot explain the mechanism yet, but the sliding is a fact.\\" The factual proofs came in the early 1980s when it could be demonstrated the actual sliding motion using novel sophisticated tools by different researchers. =Cross-bridge mechanism= With substantial evidence, Hugh Huxley formally proposed the mechanism for sliding filament and is variously called swinging cross-bridge model, cross-bridge theory or cross- bridge model. (He himself preferred the name \\"swinging crossbridge model\\", because, as he recalled, \\"it [the discovery] was, after all, the 1960s\\".) He published his theory in the 20 June 1969 issue of Science under the title \\"The Mechanism of Muscular Contraction\\". According to his theory, filament sliding occurs by cyclic attachment and detachment of myosin on actin filaments. Contraction occurs when the myosin pulls the actin filament towards the centre of the A band, detaches from actin and creates a force (stroke) to bind to the next actin molecule. This idea was subsequently proven in detail, and is more appropriately known as the cross-bridge cycle.

In a space-based laboratory, up to 10 seconds interaction times and as low as 1 picokelvin temperatures are achievable, and it could lead to exploration of unknown quantum mechanical phenomena and test some of the most fundamental laws of physics. These experiments are best done in a freely falling environment, because it is more conducive to uninhibited formation of Bose Einstein Condensates. Ground based experiments suffer from the effect of the Condensate interacting asymmetrically with the apparatus, interfering with the time evolution of the Condensate. In orbit, experiments can last much longer because freefall is sustained indefinitely. NASA's JPL scientists state that the CAL investigation could advance knowledge in the development of extremely sensitive quantum detectors, which could be used for monitoring the gravity of Earth and other planetary bodies, or for building advanced navigation devices.

It was designed by William Holloway Chambers and built from 1878 to 1880 by William Webster. It is also known as Eagle Street Fountain. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Mooney Memorial Fountain, corner of Queen and Eagle Streets, October 1926 Inscriptions of the aldermen etc., 2013 This fountain, erected between 1878 and 1880, was designed by the City Engineer, William Holloway Chambers. It was built at a cost of as part of measures to enhance the visual character of that part of the city. The fountain was funded by the Brisbane Municipal Council and public subscriptions. The fountain incorporated local porphyry (Brisbane tuff), Murphys Creek sandstone, and imported granite and marble. Inscribed on the fountain were the names of the Aldermen in the 1879 Brisbane Town Council, the City Engineer, the Town Clerk, and William Webster, the sculptor. The fountain popularly became known as the Mooney Memorial Fountain. This name arose through donations given at the time towards a memorial to James Mooney, a volunteer fireman who had lost his life while fighting a fire in Queen Street in March 1877. The official Mooney Memorial, however, was erected above Mooney's grave at Toowong Cemetery using funds raised publicly by his friends and fire-fighter colleagues. When the Eagle Street fountain was restored in 1988, a special tablet was inscribed as a dedication to James Mooney and to other firemen who had lost their lives in the line of duty.  Description  Plaque commemoriating James Mooney, 2013 This highly decorative drinking fountain stands on a triangular piece of land at the junction of Queen and Eagle Streets. The foundation and steps are square and built of porphyry (Brisbane tuff). The base is square and built of granite from Mount Alexander in Victoria. It has four corner columns on its granite base, with richly foliated capitals and raised pedestals, surmounted by four Gothic arches which support a foliated and ribbed spire. The spire, which was originally topped by an ornate finial, rises to above the ground. The portion between the columns and below the arches is of sandstone ashlar, and this is where the plaques are located. Three lions heads above ornate basins, all of white Sicilian marble are located between the base of the piers on three sides of the fountain. The water supply through the heads was regulated by a system easily accessible by the removal of a single stone. Although the fountain originally dominated the Eagle Street corner, the scale of recent adjacent high-rise buildings has lessened its visual impact. However, a large fig nearby supports its present claim as a landmark.  Heritage listing  Eagle Street Fountain was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Eagle Street Fountain is significant as an excellent example of a Victorian era public monument and amenity of careful and ornate design and fine materials and workmanship. Situated at the intersection of Queen and Eagle Streets, the Eagle Street Fountain is significant for its landmark value.

He was a member of the Chattanooga, Tennessee City Council for District 7, but was defeated in a run-off election on April 11. He was the first openly LGBT individual to be elected to Chattanooga's City Council. He also serves as a member of the Tennessee Democratic Party State Executive Committee. Political career Anderson started his political career as a Democratic Party activist. He was elected in 2003 as the President of the Tennessee Young Democrats which also gave him a seat on the Tennessee Democratic Party State Executive Committee. He was later elected in 2007 as the Executive Vice President of the Young Democrats of America nationally when that organization would be led for the first time by an openly gay President and Executive Vice President. He was elected to the Chattanooga City Council in 2013. Domestic Partnership Benefits Ordinance Anderson proposed an equal domestic partnership benefits ordinance which the city council passed on November 12, 2013 in a 5-4 vote in favor of allowing domestic partnership benefits for same-sex couples in the city of Chattanooga. On November 19, 2013, the city council in a final vote, voted 5-3 in favor of allowing domestic partnership benefits. Before the domestic partnership ordinance went into effect, the Citizens for Government Accountability and Transparency, a local segment of the Tea Party, gathered enough signatures to put repeal of the ordinance to a popular vote in August 2014. The city council did not repeal the ordinance on its own, allowing the vote to proceed on August 7, the general election date for Hamilton County. On August 7, 2014, the voters of Chattanooga repealed Ordinance 12781 by a vote of 62.58% in favor and 37.42% against.Ordinance 12781 2014 recall effort Anderson was the subject of a controversial 2014 recall effort which failed. Anderson filed a lawsuit to stop the recall accusing his opponents of bigotry because he felt the recall effort was part of a political backlash to his Domestic Partnership Ordinance.

Her notable credits include Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, and Captain Marvel. She co-created Marvel's first solo series to feature a Muslim female superhero, Ms. Marvel.  Early life  Amanat was born into a Pakistani family. She lived with her parents and 3 brothers, who were Pakistani immigrants, in a predominantly white New Jersey suburb. Throughout her childhood, Amanat had trouble fitting in and struggled with self-identity. Amanat studied political science with a focus on the Middle East at Barnard College at Columbia University in 2004.  Career  After college, Amanat worked in magazine publishing for a few years. She then worked for an indie comic book company. There, Amanat learned about graphic storytelling. Two years later, the company went out of business. Amanat's next career move was to join Marvel Comics in 2009. According to Amanat, an executive at Marvel approached her for the job because she was different from their average employee. She said that the executive told her she had \\"something different to offer than the regular fanboy who has read comics since he was a kid. [She has] a different voice, and [they] need [her] voice in order to change Marvel.\\" Currently, she is the Director of Content and Character Development at Marvel Comics. In 2014, she co-created Marvel's first solo series to feature a female Muslim superhero called Ms. Marvel. The comic spent several weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers List and also won the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story in 2015. Ms. Marvel sells much more digitally than in stores, and has at times been Marvel's top digital seller overall.  Inspiration  In her Ted Talk, Amanat stated that \\"the big idea behind Ms. Marvel [was] very much about minority representation, the bigger idea was about finding your authentic self\\". While creating the comic, she drew on her own experience as the child of Pakistani immigrants in the New Jersey suburbs in hopes that the next generation will not experience identity rejection as she did through a relatable superhero.

Retail Week. 10 April 2008 Designers' legacy Hawes & Curtis are known for having introduced the backless evening waistcoat. It was an innovation of the ‚Äòdress soft‚Äô era popularised by the Duke of Windsor. The waistcoat was designed without a back and held in place by means of bands, fastened with a buckle or button across the back at the waistline. When worn, the waistcoat always remained in position under the tailcoat and was renowned for its comfort. Fred Astaire allegedly approached Hawes & Curtis to have one made, only to be regretfully refused due to the high demand for such garments from the British aristocracy. According to the Review of Savile Row Tailors, by the 1930s, \\"Mr. Curtis was an authority in evening dress and had done more to keep shirts from bulging out of up-creeping waistcoats than any other young man in London. Evening shirts and waistcoats were made on scientific mathematical lines ‚Äì yet were chic withal.\\"Review of Savile Row tailors 1930 London is a Man‚Äôs Town by Helen Josephy and Mary Margaret McBride Hawes & Curtis also assisted the Duke of Windsor in creating his now famous Windsor knot, by introducing an extra layer at the inside of the tie.
