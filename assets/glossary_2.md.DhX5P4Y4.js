In the first case, it was used to describe an anonymous person from Berlin, Germany, who has exhibited prolonged \\"post-treatment control\\" of HIV viral load after HIV treatments were interrupted. In the second case, the phrase was used to preserve the anonymity of the first individual who is considered to have been cured of HIV infection, when his case was presented at the 2008 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, where his cure was first announced, and because he lived in, and was treated in Berlin. He chose to come forward and make his name, Timothy Ray Brown, public in late 2010. Eleven years later, nearly on the same date, at the same conference, it was announced that it appeared that a second man had been cured; he was called the \\"London Patient\\". The patient described made himself and his name, Adam Castillejo, public in March 2020. He also received a bone marrow transplant to treat a cancer (Hodgkin's lymphoma) but was given weaker immunosuppressive drugs. The selected donor also carried the CCR5-Δ32 mutation.  Cases  The first Berlin patient was described in 1998. After receiving an experimental therapy, the patient, who has remained anonymous, has maintained low levels of HIV and has remained off antiretroviral therapy. The world-renowned \\"second\\" Berlin patient, Timothy Ray Brown, had a bone marrow transplant on February 7, 2007 to cure his leukemia, and hopefully his HIV. The results of the procedure were presented by Dr. Gero Hütter at the CROI 2008 Conference in Boston. He received a stem cell transplant from a donor naturally immune to HIV and has remained off antiretroviral therapy since the first day of his stem cell transplant. Their stories were chronicled in the 2014 book, Cured: The People who Defeated HIV (2015) by Nathalia Holt. The Visconti Cohort, a group of fourteen patients who received early therapy for the virus (described in a scientific paper published in 2013), were considered to be in \\"long-term virological remission,\\" meaning that they still harbor the virus within their bodies but HIV viral loads are low or undetectable despite being off antiretroviral therapy. At least two Visconti cohort members have since restarted antiretroviral therapy; in one case due to increasing viral load and CD4 T cell count decline, and in another case due to a cancer diagnosis. Another cohort member is displaying clear evidence of declining CD4 T cell counts over time. This information was revealed in the last two slides of a presentation given by Asier Sáez-Cirión at the International AIDS Society's Towards an HIV Cure Symposium in 2015. Timothy Ray Brown is the only individual who is considered to have a sterilizing cure, meaning there is strong evidence that he no longer harbors infectious HIV virus within his body. Anonymous: the 1998 Berlin patient The first Berlin patient was a German man in his mid-twenties. He was a patient of Dr. Heiko Jessen in Berlin, Germany. He was diagnosed with acute HIV infection in 1995. He was prescribed an unusual combination therapy: didanosine, indinavir and hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea was the most unusual of the three, as it is a cancer drug not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HIV treatment. The combination was part of a small trial Dr. Jessen was testing in patients during acute HIV infection. After several treatment interruptions, the patient went off the prescribed therapy completely. The virus became almost undetectable. The patient has remained off antiretroviral therapy. In 2014 a follow-up report in NEJM concludes \\"a likely explanation for control of viral replication in this patient is genetic background, regardless of intervention,\\" although this point is still under debate. The NEJM update reports that the individual possesses the HLA-B*57 allele which has been associated with HIV control, and a large proportion of CD8 T cell responses targeting HIV are restricted by HLA-B*57. Timothy Ray Brown: the 2008 cured Berlin patient The most famous Berlin patient is Timothy Ray Brown. He is originally from Seattle, Washington. He was diagnosed with HIV in 1995 and began antiretroviral therapy. In 2006, Brown was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). His physician, Dr. Gero Hütter, at Charité Hospital in Berlin, arranged for him to receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a donor with the \\"delta32\\" mutation on the CCR5 receptor. This mutation, found at relatively high frequencies in Northern Europeans (16%), results in a mutated CCR5 protein. The majority of HIV cannot enter a human cell without a functional CCR5 gene. An exception to this is a small minority of viruses that use alternate receptors, such as CXCR4 or CCR2. Those individuals who are homozygous for the CCR5 mutation are resistant to HIV and rarely progress to AIDS. Brown received two stem cell transplants from one donor homozygous for the delta32 mutation: one in 2007 and one in 2008. Brown stopped taking his antiretroviral medication on the day of his first transplant. Three months after the first stem cell transplant, levels of HIV rapidly plummeted to undetectable levels while his CD4 T cell count increased. In addition, blood and tissue samples from areas of the body where HIV is known to hide were tested. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. As of 2011, Brown remains off antiretroviral therapy and is considered cured, although some debate exists whether there is no trace of the virus in his body (a \\"sterilizing\\" cure) or whether he simply no longer needs treatment (a \\"functional\\" cure).. Timothy Ray Brown passed away on September 30th, 2020 after a five-month battle with leukaemia. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54355673  See also  * Mississippi baby * Lulu and Nana controversy * Ravindra Gupta, doctor who treated the London Patient.

His works Father Minor jumped into the public eye as a charismatic leader in the Catholic Church in Costa Rica, he was able to gather many people in the Paso Ancho church. =Tv program= He then got his own TV show, that lasted about 3 minutes, and in which he read a Bible passage and analyzed by applying it to everyday life. This program gave popularity to the father, who soon moved to the radio. =Radio program= Radio Maria de Guadalupe was founded with the help of many entrepreneurs, but also monetary contributions collected in donation campaigns organized by the station, through various events, from social, to even people that were made to the radio to deposit their donations. The station Radio Maria de Guadalupe collected approximately ¢ 1,000,000 (about $2,500 of that time) daily, which is a record in Costa Rican radio, second only to programs (television, radio because no one has these figures) created specifically to raise money, such as Chain Telethon or Mayor.  Controversy  However, criticism from a satirical radio comedy program, called La Patada (The Kick) conducted by a Colombian named Parmenio Medina (assassinated in 2001), created friction between the two programs, as la patada accused the Radio Maria de Guadalupe of alleged embezzlement, The kick was characterized by a cutting sarcastic humor, and their jokes used to be topics about corruption, football, politics, and now, \\"Radio Maria de Guadalupe\\". This version was supported by some former employees of the radio, but was denied by the father, despite weighing evidence against him: * Members of his family and friends made frequent trips to the United States parent company, funded with money from non-clarified * They did not any give receipts to donors. This prevented making any accounting clear The situation worsened when the priest was stopped in his car by police officer of Costa Rica driving on the night in La Sabana Metropolitan Park (which is not a road crossing zone, and that for the most part, has no lighting at night) accompanied by a minor. While the father wasn't caught committing a crime, the situation was taken by many as reprehensible, or at least suspect. The father testified that he was teaching the child how to drive.  Closing Radio Maria de Guadalupe  Due to the highly controversial situation, Monsignor Román Arrieta Villalobos (who would die two years later), the highest Catholic authority in Costa Rica, decided to terminate the operations of the radio. Several groups demonstrated against the closure, as were certain groups of taxi drivers and other followers of the radio. But the decision was taken and held. Today, the frequency is used by the radio station \\"La Paz del Dial\\" and remains of a religious theme. The murder of Parmenio  On July 7, 2001, Parmenio Medina was shot dead at the entrance of his home. This crime was perpetrated by hired killers, who fled the scene quickly, police said in a gray Hyundai. The suspicions relating Calvo to the crime were confirmed when he was arrested on charges of masterminding the crime, along with businessman Omar Chávez. Parmenio Medina's murder was heavily covered and discussed in Costa Rica. Partly this was because of the direct involvement of a notorious Catholic priest in a country with a heavy Roman Catholic majority. It was also the first murder of a journalist in Costa Rica, and thus a direct challenge to the country's freedom of expression. =Some figures of the trial = * 9 volumes of court records (one for each suspect) * 91 cassettes, product of wiretaps * 145 witnesses (some of which were attempts to coerce, attempt by one or more individuals, to modify a testimony that otherwise would be incriminating to these individuals) * 803 documents of the Public Ministry (prosecutor of the state court) arguing the criminal case against the accused On December 18, 2007, father Minor was sentenced to 15 years in prison for fraud in relation to the Catholic station Radio Maria de Guadalupe, but was acquitted of involvement in the murder of Parmenio Medina. Moreover, Omar Chavez was sentenced to 35 years in prison for the murder of Medina and 12 for fraud in relation to Radio Maria de Guadalupe, while another defendant was sentenced to 30 years for murder. In total, the 9 accused, 6 were acquitted and 3 convicted, which had generated much controversy in the country.

Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) is an instrument on the Juno spacecraft in orbit of the planet Jupiter. It is an image spectrometer and was contributed by Italy. Similar instruments are on ESA Rosetta, Venus Express, and Cassini- Huygens missions. The primary goal of JIRAM is to probe the upper layers of Jupiter's atmosphere down to pressures of 5–7 bars (72–102 pound/square inch) at infrared wavelengths in the 2–5 μm interval using an imager and a spectrometer. The Jupiter's atmosphere and auroral regions are targeted for study. In particular it has been designed to study the dynamics and chemistry in the atmosphere, perhaps determining the how Jovian hot spots form. ions, ammonia, and phosphine can be mapped. The ion of Hydrogen is rare on Earth, but is one of the most common ions in the universe and known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation. Despite the intense magnetosphere of Jupiter, the JIRAM is expected to be operational for at least the first eight orbits. Previously Jupiter was observed by an Infrared imaging spectrometer called NIMS (Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) on the Galileo Jupiter orbiter. JIRAM was used to observe Earth during its flyby en route to Jupiter. These observations were used to help calibrate the instrument, and the lunar observations were actually a critical planned step in preparing the instrument for observations at Jupiter. The polar orbit of the Juno mission permits to get unprecedented observations of the planet. In particular, the polar regions, that where never observed before Juno, can be observed with high spatial resolution. On August 27, 2016, JIRAM observed Jupiter at infrared wavelengths. The first science observation in space was conducted on Earth's Moon in October 2013. The JIRAM project was started by Professor Angioletta Coradini, however she died in 2011. The instrument was developed from Leonardo under the directions and supervision of the Institute for Space Astrophysics and Planetogy (IAPS) which is part of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics and was funded by the Italian Space Agency. Dr. Alberto Adriani of IAPS is presently the responsible of the JIRAM project. In March 2018, results from JIRAM were released showing both the North and south poles have a central cyclone surrounded by addition cyclones. The north cycle was surrounded by 8 cyclones, while the southern cyclone was surrounded by five. By this time Juno had completed 10 close passes for science observations, since arriving in Jupiter's orbit on July 4, 2016. The first science pass occurred on August 28, 2016 and JIRAM was operated during that pass. Various results, including a 3-D movie a flyover of the north pole of Jupiter with JIRAM data were released at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in April 2018.

It is executed in oil on canvas, and measures 157 cm by 116.2 cm. History The subject of the painting is Fantine, a character in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Misérables. It was painted in Paris in 1886, the year following Victor Hugo's death, and received an honourable mention from the Société des Femmes Peintres. The following year some of Hall's paintings were shown at exhibitions in Vienna, Chicago, London and Manchester, and it is likely that Fantine was among them. After Hall's death in 1910, her brother Sir Douglas Bernard Hall offered the painting to the National Gallery, London, but it was declined. During the following year he offered it to the Walker Art Gallery, where it was accepted. In 1988 the painting was restored in the Harriet Owen Hughes Conservation Centre in Bluecoat Chambers, Liverpool, and as of 2012, it hangs at the head of the main staircase of the Walker Art Gallery. Description The painting depicts the full-face portrait of a seated woman with strong highlights, in front of a dark background. The woman looks forward with a sad, wistful expression. In front of her is a sleeping baby in a cradle, with a doll in a red dress lying on the floor. In the background, an empty bottle sits on a table. The painting represents an episode in the early chapters of Les Misérables. Fantine, having fallen in love, had been made pregnant, and then abandoned. This occurred in Paris during a period following the French Revolution. The baby was later nicknamed Cosette. The painting demonstrates the sorrow and poverty of an abandoned single mother in post-Revolutionary France.

The Empire Writes Back was the first major theoretical account of a wide range of postcolonial texts and their relationship with bigger issues of postcolonial culture, and is said to be one of the most significant and important works published in the field of postcolonialism. The writers debate on the relationships within postcolonial works, study the mighty forces acting on words in the postcolonial text, and prove how these texts constitute a radical critique of Eurocentric notions of language and literature. First released in 1989, this book had a second edition published in 2002. The title references Salman Rushdie's 1982 article \\"The Empire Writes Back with a Vengeance\\". In addition to being a pun on the film Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, the phrase refers to the ways postcolonial voices respond to the literary canon of the colonial centre.

She was the best woman tennis player in New Zealand in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and possibly still the best New Zealand woman player ever.Palenski p. 34 Early life and career Kathleen Nunneley was born in Little Bowden, Leicestershire, England on 16 September 1872, the daughter of John Nunneley, a wholesale grocer, and Kate Young. Her father committed suicide in 1893 and she emigrated to New Zealand with her mother and siblings in 1894 where she joined the Thorndon Lawn Tennis Club in Wellington. She won the national singles title 13 times in a row from 1895 to 1907, winning in total 32 national titles. She defeated Blanche Hillyard the Wimbledon champion, and won two mixed doubles titles with Anthony Wilding; unfortunately there were fewer opportunities at Wimbledon for women players. In May 1896 Nunneley won the singles title at the New South Wales Championships in Sydney, defeating Mabel Shaw in the final. The following year she lost her title in the challenge round to Phoebe Howlitt. Nunneley worked as a librarian for 30 years, retiring from her position as assistant in charge of the reference department at the Wellington Public Library in 1935. She had her tennis gold medals made into a trophy for interprovincial women's tennis, the Nunneley Casket. She was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.

The family consisted of the following devices: * IBM 2701 Data Adapter Unit * IBM 2702 Transmission Control * IBM 2703 Transmission Control The 2701 and 2702 were announced simultaneously with System/360 in 1964, the 2703 was announced a year later. The 270x series was superseded by the IBM 3704 and 3705 communications controllers in 1972. 2701 The 2701 supported up to four start-stop or synchronous communications lines. It had two multiplexor channel interfaces for connection to one or two host computers. The synchronous adapter originally supported the Synchronous Transmit-Receive (STR) protocol, and later Binary Synchronous Communications (BISYNC) when it was introduced in 1967, in half duplex mode at speeds of up to 40,800 bits per second (bit/s). The 2701 could also have \\"data acquisition and control adapters\\" for direct control of external equipment. Initially the 2701 supported the following devices: * IBM 1009 Data Transmission Unit * IBM 1013 Card Transmission Terminal * IBM 7701 Magnetic Tape Transmission Terminal * IBM 7702 Magnetic Tape Transmission Terminal * IBM 7710 Data Communication Unit * IBM 7711 Data Communication Unit * IBM 7740 Communication Control System * IBM 7750 Programmed Transmission Control * Remote System/360 with 2701 * Serial synchronous terminals * IBM 1030 Data Collection System * IBM 1050 Data Communication System * IBM 1060 Data Communication System * IBM 1070 Process Communication System * AT&T; 83B2 Type Selective Calling Terminals * Western Union Plan 115A Outstations * Common Carrier TWX Stations * European Teleprinters * Parallel data devices * Contact sense terminals * Contact operate terminals Later the IBM 2740 and IBM 2741 Communication Terminals, and the IBM 2260/2848 were added. 2702 The 2702 could accommodate up to 31 communication lines, but at a slower speed than the 2701. The System/360 Configurator indicates that in the 2702 supported start-stop lines only. Initially the 2702 supported the following terminals: * IBM 1030 Data Collection System * IBM 1050 Data Communication System * IBM 1060 Data Communication System * IBM 1070 Process Communication System * AT&T; 83B2 Type Selective Calling Terminals * Western Union Plan 115A Outstations * Common Carrier TWX Stations * European Teleprinters Later the IBM 2740 and IBM 2741 Communication Terminals, the IBM 1032 Digital Time Unit, and a second channel interface were added. 2703 The 2703 supported up to 176 half-duplex start- stop or Binary Synchronous communication lines. The maximum speed of one line was 2400 bit/s but the total aggregate line speed was limited. By 1970 the maximum line speed had been raised to 4800 bit/s. The 2703 attached to a single multiplexer channel; each communication line occupied a subchannel. It had a four or eight byte buffer per line to reduce data transfer to and from the host computer. The IBM 2712 Remote Multiplexer allowed up to fourteen slow speed devices to be multiplexed over one high speed line to a 2703. As of 1967 the 2703 supported the following devices: * IBM 1030 Data Collection System * IBM 1050 Data Communication System * IBM 1060 Data Communication System * IBM 1070 Process Communication System * IBM 2741 and 2740 Communications Terminals * AT&T; 83B2 Type Selective Calling Terminals * Western Union Plan 115A Outstations * Common Carrier TWX Stations * Remote System/360 via 2701 with 2701 or 2703 * IBM 2780 Data Transmission Terminal * IBM 1130 Computing System with Synchronous Communications Adapter (SCA) Clones Many companies produced clones of 270x controllers, such as the Memorex 1270, introduced in 1970, and devices from NCR-Comten.

Before the disaster, Flight 110 had deviated from Skopje International Airport to Ohrid Airport due to a blizzard in the Macedonian capital. The plane, a Yakovlev Yak-42, was carrying 108 passengers and eight crew, and crashed about east of Ohrid Airport. All 116 people on board were killed as a result of the crash. One passenger lived for eleven days after the disaster but succumbed to his injuries. Most of the victims were Yugoslav citizens of Albanian ethnicity. The crash was Macedonia's third aviation disaster in 16 months, and remains the country's deadliest. A subsequent investigation established the cause of the accident as pilot error. Flight Flight 110 was an international scheduled passenger flight originating in Geneva, Switzerland with a final destination of Skopje, Macedonia. Due to a blizzard at Skopje, Flight 110 was diverted to Ohrid Airport. Cleared for an approach to Runway 02, the Yak-42 was approximately 2,300 feet too high to carry out a successful landing, so a missed approach procedure was executed. Shortly afterwards the crew of Flight 110 radioed that they were not receiving the VOR signal. Air Traffic control was unable to satisfy the request for a bearing and the pilot of Flight 110 advised that he could not see the runway lights. Shortly thereafter Flight 110 crashed killing 115 of the 116 people on board. One passenger survived but was badly injured. Passengers and crew Eighty percent of the passengers were citizens of Yugoslavia, mostly ethnic Albanians, while the remainder were citizens of Macedonia. The four members of the flight crew were Russian and the four cabin crew members were Macedonian. Among the passengers was a French United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) official in his mid-20s who had just returned from an assignment in war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina. Aftermath Due to Flight 110 being the third aviation disaster in a sixteen-month period to take place in his country, Minister of Urban Planning, Civil Engineering, Communications and Ecology resigned. The pilots association complained of broken equipment and poor safety standards at both Skopje and Ohrid Airports. On 1 December 1993, the sole survivor died without ever regaining consciousness in the days following the crash of Avioimpex Flight 110. Flight 110 remains the deadliest aviation crash to ever take place in Macedonia. Cause The cause of the crash was attributed to a violation of the airport traffic pattern by the crew of Flight 110, who initiated a turn into rising terrain. A contributing factor was their decision to proceed with the approach even though they were not receiving a navigational signal due to being out of range of the VOR station. In addition, the air traffic controller's transmissions were spoken in Macedonian, but the crew of the aircraft communicated in Russian and English.

It has an inverted egg-shape, with a semi-circular head, 11 abdominal segments and a tail spine. It is a typical member of the group Aglaspidida.  Etymology  Beckwithia was named after Frank Beckwith, editor and publisher of the Millard County Chronicle of Delta, Utah in the early to middle 1900s, who had a passion for trilobites.http://www.fossilmuseum.net/fossils/aglaspida/beckwithia/Beckwithia.htm  Distribution  Beckwithia has been collected from the Middle and Upper Cambrian of Utah (Weeks Formation, House Range, Millard County) and from the Franconian (in North-America called Sunwaptan) of Wisconsin.  Taxonomic history  Beckwithia was previously placed in a separate family, the Beckwithiidae, but it has now been established that the defining character (that the terminal segments appeared to be fused) is actually an artifact.  Description  A cephalon of Beckwithia typa, 25 mmThe outline of the exoskeleton of Beckwithia is an inverted egg-shape with a stout sword-like tail spine or telson. The dorsal shield covering the cephalothorax (or prosoma) is semi-circular, with the margin curving smoothly from the front to an acute, but rather small genal spine at the outside and the back. The front and side margin is bordered by a flatted and undecorated zone of almost constant length/width. The area within that band is densely covered in pustules. Two distinctly raised eyes that are circular to oval are located at the outer rim of what could be compared to a trilobite glabella, with a strongly effaced outline and lobes. The abdomen (or opisthosoma) consists of 11 segments (or possibly sometimes 10 or 12) perpendicular to the midline, that terminate to the sides in small spines that angle to the back. Each segment carries a spine at midline too that is directed backward, a character that distinguishes Beckwithia from other Aglaspidid genera. Only one species, Beckwithia typa, is currently recognized.

The machined part is cut off and new material has to be fed into the machine.  Function  Bar pullers are used in CNC lathes to automatically draw in bars from the clamping chuck. In this case they serve as a substitute for a bar feeder on an NC/CNC lathe. The clamping chuck is fitted directly into the turret of the lathe or into the bar holder. There are two different versions, depending on the design: Start on the X-axis (starting from the radius) or start on the Z-axis (direction of the spindle).Berger GmbH: Programme example - positioning on X . Compiled on: April, 21st, 2010. A bar feeder magazine and workpiece stop are not required when a bar puller is used.  Material  The housing can be made of aluminium or steel, the top jaws are made of case-hardened steel, tempered steel and burnished.  History  The history of the bar puller begins with the introduction of the NC/CNC lathes in around 1980. At this time lathes were changed to permit inexpensive and economical production of small or medium-sized batches. The bar puller serves to draw bars into the lathe without operators having to feed the machine with material each time it is required. With the introduction of CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) for the lathes it was possible to ensure the reliability of the individual process operations (moving the turret to the material, opening the clamping chuck, drawing in the material, closing the clamping chuck, moving the turret away with the bar puller).

Weinberger won a bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London in the 10-kilometre open water marathon. He is the 2011 Pan American Games champion and also has a bronze medal from the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. Career Open water swimming at major international competitions started early for Weinberger. He started making a name for himself at the 2010 Pan Pacific Championships where he won bronze as a twenty-year-old, then he went on to win the gold at the 2011 Pan American Championships in Guadalajara in the marathon 10 km event. 2012 proved to be a breakthrough year for Weinberger. In the lead up to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, he won bronze and silver medals in the 10 km swim at various World Cup events. Weinberger qualified for the Olympics after he won silver at the FINA Olympic Marathon Swimming Qualifier in June 2012. At the 2012 Games, he won a bronze medal in the 10 km marathon, finishing behind Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia and Thomas Lurz of Germany. He became the first Canadian to win a medal in the event. After his win some media outlets such as the CBC were touting him as the future of Canadian Olympian swimmers. Weinberger himself said of his accomplishments that he was happy but \\"I want to be the Olympic champion in Rio in 2016.\\" During the 2013 World Aquatics Championships Weinberger was unable to repeat his Olympic success in the 10 km event and committed \\"a fatal mistake\\" when he missed a buoy and had to retreat from the front of the pack to swim around it again. He did however come within seven tenths of a second of a medal despite this, but only finished fifth. He himself noted his mistake and frustration, stating \\"I'm one of the strongest guys out there and I know I could have come first. It's just so disappointing that I made such an amateur mistake and I didn't notice the turning buoy pass on my right.\\" Weinberger was looking for redemption in his next event the 25 km but was unable to regain the success where he finished 22nd, finishing fifteen minutes behind the winner Thomas Lurz. He won the Silver Medal at the 2015 FINA World Cup event in Chun'an China then later that year qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics by finishing 8th (top 10 qualified) at the FINA World Championships in Kazan, Russia. Richard also went on to finish 3rd at the 2015 Rio Olympic Test Event. Weinberger was named to Canada's Olympic team for the 2016 Summer Olympics. He headed to Rio with a strong performance at the 2016 FINA World Cup event in Hungary where he won the bronze medal finishing less than half a second behind silver and just over two seconds behind gold. He finished in 17th place at the 2016 Summer Olympics. In April 2017, Weinberger was named to Canada's 2017 World Aquatics Championships team in Budapest, Hungary. Personal Born in Moose Jaw, Weinberger learned to swim at a family pool in a residential compound in Saudi Arabia, where his father was working at the time. He was often moved around as his father is a commercial pilot. Weinberger spent much of his life in Surrey, British Columbia, where he attended Semiahmoo Secondary School, but moved to Victoria, British Columbia to attend the University of Victoria where he currently resides and trains. He swims and trains with Ron Jacks at Pacific Coast Swimming, he got into open water swimming at the University of Victoria after seeing friend Dave Creel doing longer workouts. He admits that swimming in the open water sometimes scares him, as he often encounters wildlife in the water or even the vast depths of the ocean can lead to it getting into his head. He commented on it saying that \\"If I see anything I'll freak out, but if I don't see anything I'll freak out.

The former Lanzhou West railway station officially closed on March 9, 2012, for renovation and construction of the current station complex.http://www.echinacities.com/news/Lanzhou-West-Railway-Station-Closes Current Lanzhou West railway station Situated a kilometre to the west of the old station, a new high speed railway station was constructed. This station has become the centre for most high speed services in Lanzhou, equalling Lanzhou railway station in importance for long distance and regional rail services. It will also serve as a major transportation interchange with a major long distance and local bus terminal plus connections to Lanzhou Metro's Lines 1 and 2 (U/C). Built on the site of a former rail freight yard at a cost of 3.188 billion Yuan,http://finance.people.com.cn/n/2014/0823/c388222-25523631-3.html it dwarfs the former Lanzhou West railway station in almost every respect in terms of size and services. The entire station site encompasses over 680,000m2 of space. The station hall is built over 5 main levels, 2 above ground and 3 below, with an area of 220,000m2, making it the largest transportation building in Lanzhou. It features 13 platforms, 2 side platforms and 11 island platforms, servicing 26 tracks. It opened on December 26, 2014. This was in line with the opening of the Lanzhou-Ürümqi High Speed Railway.http://gs.cnr.cn/gsxw/gngj/201312/t20131231_514536028.shtml {  Cranes above the new High Speed Railway Lanzhou West railway station under construction July 2013  Formwork rising up at the new High Speed Railway Lanzhou West railway station under construction July 2013  CRH5A bound for Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport railway station at Lanzhou West railway station  Underground arrivals hall } Connections =Bus lines= The adjacent bus station () offers connections to destinations in all directions, including the city centre and Lanzhou railway station. http://www.lu35.com/bus/149_20483.htmlhttp://www.lzbus.com/www/Default.htm =Metro= * Line 1 * Line 2 (Under construction) References Category:Stations on the Xuzhou–Lanzhou High-Speed Railway Category:Transport in Lanzhou Category:Railway stations in Gansu Category:Stations on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Category:Railway stations in China opened in 1953 Category:1953 establishments in China ","title":"Lanzhou West railway station"},{"id":"36685800","text":"Van Wagenen is a surname.

Origin  The surname van Wolfswinkel traces its origins to a farm in the village Renswoude called \\"Klein Wolfswinkel\\" which translates to \\"small wolf's store/shop\\". The middle part van means \\"from\\" in Dutch. The name could either be from the farm being a store back then and where back then in the area where wolves would roam. Or it could be from the farm also being a store in those days owned by someone named Wolf (or Wulf as old translation could be). The farm has had the name \\"Klein Wolfswinkel\\" since at least 1321. In 1920 the farm building, of Saxon type, was destroyed in a fire. The rebuilt building was so damaged by the Second World War that a new farm was built in 1950. Despite multiple versions of the surname, the original name remains \\"van Wolfswinkel\\". The farm remained from January 31, 1696, until mid-19th century in the possession of the \\"van Wolfswinkel\\" bloodline. In the mid-19th century the farm was sold to the Baron Taets van Amerongen (the baron of Renswoude). Since 1974 the farm has been in possession of H. van den Dikkenberg and his descendants. Forefather \\"De (The) Swarte Jan Arissen\\" is the man known to be the forefather of the van Wolfswinkel bloodline. His grandson Jan Arissen Swart gained ownership of the farm on January 31, 1696. His second son was, before August 18, 1711, (as it being the date of his loan deed of the farm), still known as Breunis Jansen Swart but after known as Breunis Jansen (van) Wolfswinkel.

Statistics In 2010 there were 78,386 property crimes, 10,057 violent crimes, 130 murders, and 583 rapes reported in Connecticut.Uniform Crime Reporting Data Tool FBI. Retrieved August 10, 2012 Five years later, in 2015 violent crimes dramatically decreased to 8,123, a drop of nearly 2,000. The violent crime rate in the state was 227 per 100,000 residents, compared to the U.S. rate of 397 per 100,000 nationwide. Connecticut released its most recent Uniform Crime Report in 2016. According to this report, there were 8,148 violent crimes committed that year. Of those, there were 77 homicides, 777 rapes, 2,709 robberies and 5,585 aggravated assaults.{cite web title= Uniform Crime Reports: Publications & Queriable Statistics url= http://www.dpsdata.ct.gov/dps/ucr/ucr.aspx website= CT.gov State of Connecticut}} History =Notable murders= On July 23, 2007, a home invasion in Cheshire, Connecticut occurred, resulting in the murder of three people. Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters were raped and murdered while her husband, Dr. William Petit, was severely injured but survived. The two perpetrators, Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky, received death sentences in 2010 and 2012 respectively. However, when Connecticut abolished the death penalty in 2015, both were resentenced. Steven Hayes was re- sentenced in 2016 to six life terms in prison. In 2017, Joshua Komisarjevsky and his lawyers filed a motion with the state Supreme Court for a new trial, claiming judicial errors during the pre-trial process. On August 3, 2010, a mass shooting occurred at a warehouse owned by a beer distribution company in Manchester. 34-year-old Omar Thornton shot and killed 8 coworkers and injured 2 others before killing himself. Another notable criminal incident occurred on December 14, 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut with the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. At approximately 9:30 a.m.t, 20-year-old Adam Lanza fatally shot twenty school children and six school employees prior to committing suicide. Prior to the school shooting, Lanza murdered his mother. This incident remains one of the deadliest mass shootings in the United States, with the fourth-highest total of gunshot victim fatalities in U.S. history.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/deadliest-mass- shootings-171002111143485.html =Crime rates dropping= Violent crimes in Connecticut have dropped by nearly 10% for the second year in a row according to the Uniform Crime Report statistics. In 2014, Connecticut reported 236.9 violent crimes per 100,000 people; crime that year was at its lowest rate since 1974. Additionally, with a drop of approximately 6.7% the state had the fourth highest crime-rate decrease nationally. The eight major crimes reported to the FBI in the U.S. are murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, automobile theft and arson. Overall, these types of violent crimes are decreasing in Connecticut. Capital punishment Between 1616 and 2005, 126 people were sentenced to death and executed in Connecticut. In April 2012, Governor Dannel Malloy signed an order to abolish the death penalty; Connecticut was the 17th state in the nation to do so. Inmates formerly sentenced to death had their sentences reduced to life imprisonment without parole. Connecticut was the fifth state to abolish the death penalty between 2007 and 2012.Michael Kirk, \\"The History of the Death Penalty in Connecticut,\\" www.today.uconn.edu, Oct. 24, 2011, Cities with highest crime rates According to a 2014 FBI Uniform Crime Report, the Connecticut cities with the most violent crimes were Bridgeport (1,338), New Haven (1,380) and Hartford (1,380). These cities also had the most incidents of murder: Bridgeport with 11, Hartford with 19 and New Haven with 12. In Bridgeport, there were also 92 reports of rape that year which was significantly higher than the numbers for all of the other cities and towns in Connecticut. New Haven had the second highest number with 80 reported in 2014. The third highest was Hartford with 45 cases. Additionally, Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford had the highest robbery crime rates: 546 in Bridgeport, 502 in Hartford and 591 in New Haven. Crime was not nearly as widespread in other cities and towns. Possible reasons for the higher crime rates in these cities included their larger populations and widespread poverty levels. Cities with lowest crime rates According to NeighborhoodScout.com, the top ten cities with the lowest crime rates in Connecticut, as of 2018, are: Weston, Kent, Sherman, Washington, Pomfret, Barkhamsted, Cornwall, Sharon, Ridgefield, and Salisbury. Juvenile system Connecticut has a state-level system that includes juvenile courts, detention centers, private facilities and juvenile correctional facilities. After juveniles are released, they get help from the Court Support Services Division of the Connecticut Judicial Branch and from the Department of Children and Family Services. Criminal statues for juveniles and adults are the same. However, if the offender is under the age of 16, they will be sent to a juvenile detention center and transferred over to Adult Court once they turn 16. State assistance for juvenile offenders has a number of objectives: to lower the rate of repeat offending in the community, provide offender rehabilitation, and help offenders understand the consequences of their actions. Police officers who stop these juveniles have several options. They will warn them, talk to the parents, let them go, offer organizations that can provide them with assistance and/or make an arrest. Children who are arrested have to go to a hearing in front of a judge at a superior court who decides whether or not to send them to a detention center. Marijuana laws Connecticut has decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Anyone under the age of 21 caught with marijuana will have their driver's license suspended for 60 days. If found with less than ½ oz. (first offense), a $150 fine is imposed. However, the fine is $500 for a repeat offense. For ½ - 4 oz., the first offense is one year of incarceration and a $1,000 fine. A second offense may be punishable by five years of incarceration and a $3,000 fine. Quantities amounting to more than 4 oz. of marijuana results in five years of incarceration and a $2,000 fine. For a second offense, it is a 10-year sentence and a $5,000 fine. Connecticut residents with cancer, Crohn's disease, or HIV/AIDS may obtain a medical marijuana card. Growers of medical marijuana must be in buildings that meet the exacting standards of pharmaceutical factories. Cannabis with less than a 0.3% THC content (also known as hemp) and a higher cannabidiol content is legal for over-the-counter sale to adults over the age of 21 years old and can be found in some gas stations and head shops.

It was the primary post-World War II operator of surplus Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress aircraft, and also operated Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star and a few Boeing RB-47 Stratojet bombers that were converted into drone aircraft during the early years of the Cold War. It was last active with the Air Proving Ground Center, based at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where it was discontinued on 1 February 1961. A notable moment in the Group's history is that a Douglas DB-17P (Formerly B-17G-90-DL) 44-83684 of the unit's 3225th Drone Squadron flew the last operational mission by a USAF Flying Fortress on 6 August 1959.Thompson, History = Origins = At the end of World War II, the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator were obsolete as strategic bombers, having been replaced by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. B-24 production ended after the surrender of Germany in May 1945, B-17 production ended a month earlier, in April. Many of these new aircraft were simply not needed due to the fortunes of war, and most of them were sent directly from the factory to storage depots. Initially, these unneeded aircraft were scheduled for scrapping and metal reclamation. These included thousands of war-weary combat aircraft returned from the overseas theaters. A few B-17s were sold to the civil marketplace, however most wound up in the smelters for aluminum recycling. The Army Air Forces, however, decided to retain several hundred new B-17s. The postwar Air Force B-17s found uses as personnel and VIP transports (CB/VB-17), loaned to defense contractors for various research purposes (EB-17 and JB-17), for mapping (FB-17), for air-sea rescue (SB-17), for weather reconnaissance (WB-17), and for trainers (TB-17). All postwar B-17 conversions and ongoing depot-level maintenance was managed by the Middletown Air Depot at Olmsted Air Force Base, Pennsylvania. Air Proving Ground Command obtained B-17s for guided missile launching and as aerial targets for new weapons systems. They were designated as follows: * BQ-17 was the designation used for drone aircraft that would fly near or even through mushroom clouds during postwar atomic tests. Equipped with air sampling equipment and other technologies for monitoring the test. * MB-17 was the designation assigned to aircraft used as airborne launchers for experiments with the VB-6 Felix, VB-3 Razon, VB-13 Tarzon guided gliding bombs and first-generation Republic-Ford JB-2 aerodynamic winged guided missiles. One bomb or missile was mounted under each wing of the aircraft. They were also used to launch small drones for airborne gunnery targets. One MB-17 survives, 44-83624 (See below).Jablonski, * QB-17L was the designation assigned to drone aircraft equipped with radio, radar, television, and other equipment. They were usually painted in red- orange Day-Glo paint with black diagonal stripes for increased visibility. The QB-17N was a drone conversion similar to the QB-17L but with a different guidance system and not fitted with television cameras. The optical tracking equipment was installed in detachable wingtip pods equipped with explosive bolts and parachutes for recovery of test data in the event of the loss of the drone. * DB-17 was the designation for B-17s converted as drone director aircraft. They would be used to guide the QB-17 target drones during the missile tests. When they were worn out or the need was diminished, other postwar military B-17s would more often than not be sent to Middletown and converted to the QB-17 drone configuration. They would then be transferred to Proving Ground Command to be expended as aerial targets. = Predecessor units= In 1946, the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group was activated at Eglin Air Force Auxiliary Field #3, Florida. The unit's formation was a result of the Air Materiel Command's Engineering Division at Wright-Patterson AFB looking for places to allow its contractors to launch missiles. It was with this group that the DB-17/QB-17 Fortress Drone Director/Drone pairing was developed. In May 1946, sixteen B-17s were withdrawn from storage for conversion into drones with the addition of radio, radar, television, and other equipment. Six other Fortresses were converted as drone controllers.Mindling & Bolton, On 13 January 1947 the group flew a QB-17 drone, guided by a director DB-17, from its base at Eglin to Washington D.C. on a simulated bombing mission as a demonstration of capability. It also made preparations for operating QB-17s for the Operation Sandstone atomic bomb tests during April and May 1948. The group also picked up responsibility for drone QB-17 bombing tests (e.g., Operation Banshee) The 550th Guided Missiles Wing was activated in 1949 as an expansion of the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group. The 1st Guided Missiles Squadron operated MB-17s, and the 2d Guided Missiles Squadron operated QB-17/DB-17s. Although based at Eglin Air Force Base, the wing established Detachment 1 at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico and Detachment 2 at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California. In 1949, the 2nd GMS tallied 3,052 flight hours without mishap and secured the green and white pennant denoting safety supremacy for USAF B-17 type aircraft for the fourth straight time, gaining permanent possession of the three-starred flag. The 550th GMW played a prominent part in the spring of 1949 in the aerial filming of \\"Twelve O' Clock High\\", filmed in part at Eglin AFB.Fort Walton Beach, Florida, \\"Guided Missile Squadron Captures Safety Supremacy\\", Playground News, 30 March 1950, Vol. 5, No. 9, p. 19. By March 1950, the 2d Guided Missile Squadron, had 62 pilots manning 14 B-17s, three B-29s, and three QF-80A Shooting Stars, yellow-tailed drone aircraft used in the role of testing guided missiles. The 550th wing moved to Patrick Air Force Base, Florida on 11 December 1950 as a result of a reorganization of Proving Ground Command into Air Research and Development Command and to facilitate the development of long-range atmospheric guided missiles using the Florida Missile Test Range. =3205th Drone Group= The 3201st Air Base Support Squadron was activated at Eglin on 26 April 1950 from personnel and equipment assigned to the 2nd Guided Missiles Squadron. It assumed the QB-17/DB-17 drone aerial target mission. Redesignated the 3200th Drone Group on 1 June 1951, it took over the detachments at Holloman and Point Mugu. It participated in Atomic tests, Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Island Group, Pacific 1950–1951 In July 1951, with the expansion to group level, several squadrons were activated to support operations. the 3205th and 3215th Drone Squadrons were activated at Eglin; the 3225th absorbed Detachment 1 at Holloman, which operated QB-17s and QF-80s over the Army White Sands Missile Range; the 3235th absorbed Detachment 2 at NAS Point Magu, which operated QB-17s over the Navy Pacific Missile Range Facility. * The 3225th Drone Squadron at Holloman AFB supported the 6540th Missile Test Wing, which used the White Sands Range for testing numerous air- to-air missiles, using QB-17s as aerial targets. Also, the Army utilized drone Fortresses in Nike Ajax surface-to-air missile tests. * The 3225th Drone Squadron at Point Mugu used the Fortresses as targets for Navy fighters that would intercept the drones over the Pacific with Hughes AIM-4 Falcon air-to- air missile. Often, the QB-17 would be the subject of intentional near misses to preserve the drone for as many missions as possible. Other QB-17s were used for various unmanned but destructive tests such as the ditching tests carried out by NACA in San Francisco Bay. In April 1956, with the development of the IM-99 Bomarc surface-to-air missile, the 3215th Drone Squadron was moved from Eglin to Patrick to support the Bomarc testing program. From Patrick, DB/QB-17s could take off and the missile could be test-fired from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 3 over the Atlantic Missile Range. One such trial on 23 October 1957 (Bomarc 624-11) saw the unarmed missile destroy a Flying Fortress target by a direct collision, more than 100 miles from the missile's launch point.Encyclopedia Astronautica Bomarc However, the supply of QB-17s was dwindling in the late 1950s, and in any case the 1930s-designed B-17 could not realistically represent modern Soviet aircraft. This led to the refitting of two RB-47E Stratojets (53-4245, 53–4246) that were being phased out of the inventory to a QB-47E drone configuration. The QB-47s also carried electronic countermeasures gear and chaff dispensers in order to make for a more realistic target for the Bomarc during the tests. The Bomarcs were programmed to intentionally near-miss because the Stratojets were deemed too expensive to be intentionally destroyed in testing. However, one Stratojet drone did end up being shot down when an intended near-miss by a Bomarc turned into a hit.Baugher, Joe (2003), Boeing QB-47E StratojetB-47 serial number search =F-80 drone operations= In parallel with the B-17 drone program, in 1946/47, three P-80A Shooting Star fighters were converted to radio-controlled drones in a test program to develop faster, more maneuverable aerial gunnery targets for the new generation of jet fighters entering the Air Force inventory. All armament was removed, and radio control equipment was installed. The pilot's controls were retained, which made it possible for the drone to be operated either manned or unmanned. Postwar funding and personnel shortages, however, led to the cancellation of this project.Baugher, Joe (1999), Lockheed QF-80 The project was revived in 1951 when eight first-generation F-80As were converted to the QF-80 drone configuration at the Sacramento Air Depot, McClellan Air Force Base, California, under a project known as \\"Bad Boy.\\" These aircraft were assigned to the 3205th Drone Squadron for testing over the Eglin range.AFHRA Document 01014352 A second batch of 14 QF-80s were converted in December 1953 at McClellan that featured larger center-mounted wingtip tanks equipped with cameras rather than fuel so that attacking aircraft could be photographed. These cameras could be jettisoned by remote control and lowered by parachute. In November 1953, 55 more F-80Cs were converted to the QF-80F drone configuration, with improved radio-control equipment and a runway arrestor hook. Ten dual-seat T-33A Shooting Star jet trainers were also converted to DT-33 drone director aircraft to guide the drones.AFHRA Document 00475310 The drones were usually painted all red, but with natural metal finish on the top surfaces of both wings. Many QF-80s were operated as pilotless drones both at the Eglin as well as the Holloman test ranges. In addition, Several QF-80s were used for sampling of radioactive material from mushroom clouds of nuclear tests at the Atomic Energy Commission Nevada Test Site. The last of the QF-80 drones were still operating as aerial targets in 1962. =Inactivation= By 1958, the group's DB-17P Flying Fortresses were wearing out, and the number of available QB-17 drones was down to a handful. The wartime bombers were not designed or built for long-term use when new, and the supply of replacement parts was extremely limited, causing the aircraft to be very expensive to maintain. The aircraft had soldiered long past their estimated lifetimes and were gradually taken out of service and retired to the 2704th Air Force Aircraft Storage and Disposition Group at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. From the 2704th group the aircraft were sold to private owners or donated to aircraft museums (see below). The last active USAF B-17 Flying Fortress, was a Douglas B-17G-90-DL, 44-83684. It was manufactured in Long Beach, California, being accepted by the USAAF on 7 May 1945. It was never assigned to an operational unit, instead being placed in long-term storage at South Plains Army Airfield, Lubbock, Texas in October. With the closure of South Plains AAF, the plane was flown to Pyote Army Airfield, Texas in July 1947 where it was stored by the 2753d Aircraft Storage Squadron. It was pulled from storage in March 1950 and flown to the Middletown Air Depot, Olmsted AFB, Pennsylvania, where it was inspected and modified to a DB-17G. On 18 July 1950 it arrived at Eglin AFB, Florida and was assigned to the 3201st Air Base Support Squadron. The aircraft was deployed to the Pacific Proving Grounds where it was a support aircraft during the Operation Greenhouse nuclear tests beginning in April 1951. Upon its return to Eglin in June, it was sent to Detachment 1, 3200th Drone Group (later 3225th Drone Squadron) at Holloman. It was modified into a DB-17P at Olmsted Air Force Base in 1956. The last flight from Eglin Air Force Base of a QB-17 was from Eglin Auxiliary Field No. 3 on 29 May 1958. The drone was sent out over the Gulf of Mexico as a target and was shot down. It was the last QB-17 at Eglin although the 3205th Drone Group still had two to three at Holloman Air Force Base and the same number at Patrick Air Force Base. The requiem for the plane came from Lt. Col. Walter W. Gannon, Deputy Commander of the Drone Group. He discussed the history of the Fortress as Col. Maurice C. Horgan, Commander of the 3205th. Drone Group and Lt. Col. John S. Sparks, Commander of the 3205th. Drone Squadron made a final test of the aircraft before it started its last nullo mission.\\"Last 'Flying Fortress' Takes Off at Eglin Field,\\" Playground News, 5 June 1958 Aircraft 44-83684 remained and flew the last operational mission by a USAF B-17 on 6 August 1959 when it directed QB-17L 44-83717 from Holloman as a target for an AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missile fired by an F-101 Voodoo. After the mission, a ceremony was held to commemorate the occasion. A few days later, it was flown to storage at Davis–Monthan.History and Lineage of the 3205th Drone Squadron, E-mail communication, AFHRA, Lineage and Honors History, 3205th Drone Squadron, 10 August 2012 With the retirement of the Flying Fortress, the group's activities were taken over by Headquarters, Air Proving Ground Center at Eglin in 1961. The program at Eglin went on to use QF-104A Starfighter drone aircraft until 1972, and subsequently was transferred to Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida as part of Aerospace Defense Command, for Aerospace Defense Command interceptor aircraft weapons targets using the Eglin range. Over the years, QF-102s (1973–1986), QF-100s (1981–1992) and QF-106s (1990–1998) have been converted into target drones.QF-104A DRONES Since August 1981 the target drone mission has been assigned to the 82d Aerial Targets Squadron, now part of the Air Combat Command, 53d Weapons Evaluation Group at Tyndall. The 82d operated retired QF-4 Phantom II aircraft (1997–2016) as target drones. The QF-4 saw a total of 238 aircraft being converted, the last of which was phased-out in 2016. In 2010 Boeing was awarded the contract to start initial work on converting the first six F-16A/Bs into aerial targets. These six aircraft are being used now as a testing platform. It is a mix of block 15/25/30 aircraft to show the feasibility of the modifications on these blocks.QF-16 Drone developmentQF-16 drone arrives for testing, prepares warfighters for tomorrow's threats =Lineage= * Organized as the 3201st Air Base Support Squadron on 26 April 1950 : Redesignated as 3200th Drone Group on 1 June 1951 : Redesignated as 3205th Drone Group on 1 December 1951 : Discontinued on 1 February 1961.

He was the last reigning Count of Ziegenhain and Nidda. He probably owed His nickname the Strong to his obesity, although he is said to have possessed an extraordinary muscle strength as a young man. His younger brother Otto was Archbishop of Trier from 1419 until his death in 1430.  Life  John initially pursued an ecclesiastical career. Between 1393 and 1406, he was canon in Trier and from 1403, he was a canon of Mainz. In 1394, he studied in Vienna and in 1396 in Heidelberg. After the early death of his elder brother Engelbert III in 1401, he succeeded as Count of Ziegenhain and Nidda. On 5 January 1417, he married Countess Elisabeth of Waldeck. This marriage remained childless.  Reign  In the war between Hesse and the Electorate of Mainz (1401–1405), John II supported Mainz. In 1401, he was taken prisoner by Landgrave Herman II of Hesse. He was released in January 1402, after he had promised to not act against Hesse in this conflict, and his brother Gottfried IX had promised the same. In 1414 John II and Gottfried IX were outlawed for their involvement in a violent feud against Siegfried of Frekenhausen. In 1415, they took Lißberg Castle by force, claiming that it was a fief of Ziegenhain and that it had reverted to them when Frederick of Lißberg had died in 1396 and that Frederick's cousin John of Rodenstein had unlawfully taken possession of the castle. In 1418, they sold a 50% share of the castle to Landgrave Louis I of Hesse. In 1420 John II gave his allodial property in the Counties of Ziegenhain and Nidda to Emperor Sigismund. In return, Sigismund enfeoffed him with the County and City of Nidda and its castle, plus the County of Ziegenhain with all the cities, villages and castles it contained and two tolls at Treysa and Gemünden. This exchange made him an imperial count, since he now held his county directly from the Emperor. Thus, he had a much stronger than before, when his feudal overlord had been the abbot of Fulda. However, his weakening of his relationship with Fulda also increased the appetite of Hesse and Mainz, who were interested in his possessions, considering that he had no male heir. Landgrave Louis I of Hesse decisively won the Mainz-Hesse War of 1427 with a victory against Mainz' commander Gottfried of Leiningen in the Battle on the Großenenglise Plateau near Fritzlar on July 23 and against Archbishop Conrad III himself at Fulda on August 10, Louis established his territorial supremacy in Upper and Lower Hesse. This meant that Ziegenhain could no longer lean on Mainz to retain its independence from Hesse. Instead, John II concluded a defensive alliance with Hesse on 29 June 1428, that made Ziegenhain virtually a Hessian dependency. This brought Hesse much closer to its goal of annexing Ziegenhain and thereby connecting Upper and Lower Hesse geographically. In 1434, the Abbot of Fulda John of Merlau enfeoffed Louis I of Hesse with Fulda's share of the County of Nidda. On 2 February 1437, John II enfeoffed Louis I with his two counties. His feudal overlords, the abbots of Fulda and Hersfeld approved this contract and sold their shares of the two counties to Hesse (Ziegenhain and Nidda were partly allodial possessions of the House of Ziegenhain, partly imperial fiefs, partly fiefs held from Fulda and partly fief held from Hersfeld. However, the contract specified that Hessian rule in John's counties would only begin after his death. John II died on 14 February 1450. He was probably buried in the church of Haina Abbey.  Succession dispute  Despite treaties between John II and Landgrave Louis I of Hesse that had been confirmed several times between 1437 and 1450, a long and bitter dispute about his inheritance broke out after his death. The tho claimants were: * Landgrave Louis I of Hesse, who proclaimed that Ziegenhain and Nidda were completed Hessian fiefs, and who occupied the territory militarily. * The Counts of Hohenlohe, who based their claim on the fact that Albert I of Hohenlohe had married Elisabeth of Hanau, who was a granddaughter of Count Gottfried VIII of Ziegenhain via her mother, Elisabeth of Ziegenhain, who had married Lord Ulrich V of Hanau. Albert's sons Albert II and Kraft V were enfeoffed on 14 May 1450 by Emperor Frederick III with the part of Ziegenhain that was an imperial fief. They were thereby raised to imperial counts.Friedrich Karl zu Hohenlohe-Waldenburg: Hohenlohe. Bilder aus der Geschichte von Haus und Land, 4th ed., Familienverband des Fürstlichen Hauses Hohenlohe, Öhringen, 1983. p. 15 Louis I ignored this enfeoffment and occupied the territory. The dispute lasted until 1495. After several armed conflicts and court cases, Hesse won, but only after Landgrave William II had paid the Counts of Hohenlohe 9000 guilders in compensation. The Ziegenhain territory has remained part of Hesse ever since, and members of the House of Hesse still use Count of Ziegenhain as one of their titles. However, the House of Hohenlohe retained the status of imperial counts, which they had obtained when they were enfeoffed with Ziegenhain, and they included the six-pointed start of Ziegenhain in their coat of arms.

Since 2001, he has been a National Endowment for the Humanities professor at the College of William & Mary, where he directs the Institute for Historical Biology. Previously, he was a professor at Howard University and the curator of Howard University's Montague Cobb Biological Anthropology Laboratory. Early life and education Blakey obtained his B.A. in Anthropology from Howard University in 1978, and an M.A. (1980) and a Ph.D. (1985) from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He served as president of the Association of Black Anthropologists from 1987 to 1989. Career =African burial ground in Manhattan= Blakey was the director of research for the New York African Burial Ground Project, now the African Burial Ground National Monument. According to Blakey, the existence of this burial ground in what is now Lower Manhattan (where between 10 and 20 thousand people of African descent were buried in the eighteenth century) was evidence of \\"false historical representation\\" and exposed as a myth the idea that New York and the northern states were not slave-owning areas. Blakey says that, in general, educated Americans had the impression that slavery played little role in the development of the northern American colonies in general, and New York City in particular. Blakey's research helps dispel those myths, and offers a \\"compelling portrait of the exploitation and violence suffered by enslaved Africans, and equally to the active resistance of people of African descent to this exploitation and violence\\". Blakey concluded that these slaves faced \\"brutal working conditions, premature rates of mortality, and excessive workloads, while nutritional deficiencies were common among young children.\\" Of the 400 sets of remains uncovered, Blakey's research team examined 27 skeletons that had filed or \\"culturally modified\\" teeth, which was considered a strong indication of African birth. Previously, only nine such skeletons had been discovered in the Americas. It is likely that these individuals had come to New York previous to 1808, when the importation of slaves from Africa was banned. Blakey's team examined more than 1.5 million artifacts discovered at the site, which included everything \\"from pottery and glassware to tools and children's toys\\". His research determined that approximately half of the African people buried at the site were children. After his research was completed, the skeletal remains were reinterred at the site \\"in 400 hand- carved mahogany coffins\\" in a 2003 ceremony described as \\"joyous and bitter all at once\\". =Analysis of racism= Blakey says that physical anthropology has a \\"pattern of denial\\" about racism, which has its origins in the dominant view that social differences are due to the inherent characteristics of individuals, and less on political and economic factors. Blakey maintains that the history of physical anthropology has been \\"sterilized\\", downplaying the role that eugenics and scientific racism had in its origins. Discussing a museum exhibit about race at the Science Museum of Virginia, Blakey criticized the contemporary reluctance to discuss racism, maintaining that \\"it has become illegitimate to talk about racism\\" and that failing to do so is \\"the new racism\\".

Career Van Hintum started playing in the youth department of FC Schadewijk before joining youth teams of PSV and later TOP Oss. In 2005, he was promoted to the first team of second division club TOP Oss. In his first season with the team, he made his professional debut and finished the season with a single league appearance. Afterwards, he established himself as a starter during the 2006–07 season, which he maintained until the summer of 2010. That summer, his club, which had at that point been renamed FC Oss, suffered relegation to the third tier. After the relegation, van Hintum left his hometown club and continued his career at the second-tier club FC Dordrecht. A season later, he moved again within the league and this time signed with PEC Zwolle. With this club he won the 2011–12 Eerste Divisie, and thus secured promotion to the Eredivisie. In the 2013–14 season, van Hintum and Zwolle won the KNVB Cup, the Dutch national cup tournament, for the first time in club history. With this win, Zwolle qualified for the Johan Cruyff Shield, the Dutch Supercup, in summer 2014. This was also won, as Zwolle beat defending Dutch champions Ajax 1–0 and also won this trophy for the first time in the club's history. Before the 2016–17 season, van Hintum moved to Turkish Süper Lig club Gaziantepspor. He suffered relegation with the club during his sole season there, and moved to Heracles Almelo afterwards.

Background By the Treaty of Campo Formio (November 1797) and the dissolution of the Republic of Venice, the Ionian Islands were ceded to the French Republic, which occupied Corfu as the département Corcyre. In 1798, Admiral Fyodor Ushakov was sent to the Mediterranean in command of a joint Russian-Turkish squadron to support General Alexander Suvorov's upcoming Italian and Swiss expedition (1799–1800). One of Ushakov's main tasks was to take the strategically important Ionian Islands from the French. In October 1798 the French garrisons were driven from Cythera, Zakynthos, Cephalonia, and Lefkada. It remained to take the largest and best-fortified island of the archipelago, Corfu. =The garrison of the island= The moat of Palaio Frourio The city of Corfu is located on the east coast in the central part of the island between two forts: * The medieval Old Fortress, on the eastern tip of the city, cut off from the city by an artificial moat; * The more modern New Fortress, a huge complex of fortifications dominating the northeastern part of the city. From the new to the old fort a high wall ran along the shore. The town was also covered by bastions on two mountains, Abraham and Salvatore, and the intermediate fort of San Rocco. From the sea, the city was protected by the well-fortified island of Vido, and the smaller island of Lazaretto, two miles up the coast, was also strengthened by the French. The New Fortress The French, commanded by the governor General Louis Chabot, had 3000 soldiers and 650 guns in Corfu, plus 500 soldiers and 5 artillery batteries on the island of Vido. In the harbour was a French squadron of two ships of the line, the 74-gun Généreux and 54-gun Leander, the 20-gun corvette Brune, a bomb-vessel, a brig and four auxiliary vessels. The siege of Corfu On 4 November 1798 Ushakov's Russian-Turkish squadron, consisting of three ships of the line, three frigates and a number of small ships, began the siege of Corfu. They were joined shortly afterwards by a Turkish squadron and another Russian squadron under the command of Captain Dmitry Senyavin. Given the strong fortifications of the island and the lack of strength for a landing, it was initially decided to wait for Turkish reinforcements for a landing force. However, on the first day the French abandoned their fortifications on Lazaretto island, which the Russians immediately occupied. On 13 November a small force of Russians landed without opposition and took the small port of Gouvia about five miles along the coast. From then on the Russians began building batteries and shelling the French-held forts. In December, another Russian squadron, this one under Rear-Admiral Pavel Pustoshkinthe, augmented the besieging forces. The combined fleet now consisted of 12 ships of the line, 11 frigates and many smaller vessels. On the night of January 26 the Généreux, with her sails painted black, and the brig escaped from the harbour and sailed to Ancona. In February, about 4,000 Ottoman troops arrived and it was decided to make a landing on the island of Vido – the key to the defense of Corfu – using naval artillery against its shore batteries. =Capture of Vido= Vido island The assault on Vido began early in the morning of 28 February 1799. After a four-hour bombardment by several ships, all five shore batteries on the island had been suppressed. The Leander and Brune tried to intervene but were damaged and forced to retreat to the protection of the batteries of Corfu. The allied fleet then landed over 2000 men on Vido and after a two-hour battle the island was taken. Of the 800 men defending the island, 200 were killed and 400 were taken prisoner, including the commandant of the island, Brigadier-General Pivron. About 150 men managed to swim to Corfu. Russian losses were 31 killed and 100 wounded. The Ottomans lost 180 killed and wounded. =Capture of Corfu city= After the fall of Vido, the key to Corfu was in the hands of Ushakov. On March 1 the captured batteries on the island opened fire on the city's forts, supported by the Russians' shore batteries and some of the Russian and Turkish warships. The allied forces stormed and captured the outlying forts of San Rocco, San Salvatore and San Abraham. On 2 March Ushakov planned to assault the main forts, but in the morning the French sent envoys to request a forty-eight-hour armistice, and on 3 March they surrendered. Aftermath The capitulation agreed between the French and Russians was an honourable one, including a provision for the French troops to be conveyed to Toulon. The remaining French ships in the harbour were taken by the allies, including the Leander which had been captured from the Royal Navy on 18 August 1798; the Russians returned her to the British. Admiral Ushakov was honoured by the Emperor of Russia with the star of the Order of St Alexander Nevsky and by the Ottoman Sultan with a chelengk, rarely awarded to non-Muslims. The capture of Corfu completed the Russo-Turkish takeover of the Ionian Islands, which was of great military and political importance. The islands became the Seven Islands Republic, a temporary protectorate of Russia and Turkey, and for several years Corfu served as a base for the Russian Mediterranean fleet. Ushakov's fleet went on to support the allied attack on Naples. Popular culture In 1953, director Mikhail Romm made a cinematographic dramatization of the Russian conquest of the Ionian Islands called Корабли штурмуют бастионы (The Ships Storm the Bastions), the second of a two-part biographical epic about admiral Ushakov. The movie was released by Mosfilm.

It was last active with the Air Proving Ground Center based at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where it was discontinued on 25 October 1963. The squadron operated various drones between 1950 and 1963 to provide targets to support development of weapons and for interceptor training. History Lockheed QF-80 drone at Eglin AFB The 3205th Drone Squadron was organized in April 1950, when it assumed the mission of operating QB-17L Flying Fortresses as drone aerial targets from the 550th Guided Missiles Wing. The squadron operated QB-17 drones and DB-17 controller aircraft, providing aerial targets for surface-to-air and air-to-air missile development programs at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The unit also used QF-80 Shooting Star jets for aerial gunnery targets for Air Defense Command interceptor squadrons. The squadron deployed elements to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Nevada Test Site and Pacific Proving Grounds during the 1950s, flying drone Flying Fortresses equipped with air sampling equipment and other instrumentation though atomic and nuclear testing mushroom clouds for post-detonation analysis. This support for nuclear testing ended in 1957, and the mission was taken over by the 4901st Support Wing (Atomic) at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. In the late 1950s as the supply of drone B-17s began to become exhausted, the squadron began to use QB-47E Stratojets as gunnery targets for missile tests. It operated the QB-47 until the early 1960s. Approximately 10 B-47 aircraft were converted to drones. Test missiles were programmed for a near-miss rather than a hit on the drone in order to conserve the target drones for multiple flights. Beginning in 1960, the squadron's QF-80 Shooting Star target drones were replaced by QF-104A Starfighters, modified F-104As that were deemed surplus to United States Air Force requirements. The QF-104s could be flown either by onboard pilots or by remote control from the ground or other aircraft. The replacement process was completed by July 1962. The squadron was discontinued in late 1963 and its mission was taken over by USAF Tactical Air Warfare Center when the aerial target mission at Eglin was transferred from Air Force Systems Command to Tactical Air Command. QF-104 aerial targets were primarily used for air-to-air gunnery targets by Air Defense Command Convair F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart interceptors. The drone mission continued at Eglin until June 1971, when it was transferred to Aerospace Defense Command's air-to-air weapons school at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. =Lineage= * Designated as the 3200th Drone Squadron and organized on 26 April 1950 : Redesignated as 3205th Drone Squadron on 1 December 1951 : Discontinued on 25 October 1963Robertson, Patsy, Lineage and Honors History of the 3205th Drone Squadron, Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell AFB, AL, 10 August 2012. =Assignments= * 3200th Proof Test Group, 26 April 1950 * 550th Guided Missiles Wing, 1 July 1950 * 3200th Proof Test Group, 1 December 1950 * 3200th Proof Test Wing, 1 April 1951 * 3200th (later 3205th) Drone Group, 1 June 1951 * Air Proving Ground Center, 1 February 1961 – 25 October 1963 =Stations= * Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, 26 April 1950 – 25 October 1963 =Aircraft= Drone Aircraft * QB-17L Flying Fortress * QB-17N Flying Fortress * QB-47E Stratojet * QF-80 Shooting Star * QF-104A Starfighter Director Aircraft * DB-17P Flying Fortress * DT-33 Shooting Star  References  =Notes= =Bibliography=  External links  Category:Military units and formations established in 1950 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1963 ","title":"3205th Drone Squadron"},{"id":"36686184","text":"Wendy Diane Isdell (born March 30, 1975) is an American author and artist.

He has represented both the Turkish Football Federation and Royal Dutch Football Association at various youth levels. Club career =PEC Zwolle= 2011–12 season Saymak made his league debut for PEC (then named FC Zwolle) when they were still playing in the second tier of Dutch league football, the Jupiler League. The game was played on 5 August 2011 and was an away game against FC Den Bosch. Saymak came on as a substitute in the 87th minute, as the game ended in a 2–2 draw. His first league goal came on 12 September 2011, in an away game against Helmond Sport. However, it turned out to be the only goal in a 3–1 defeat for PEC. Saymak's progress was rewarded with his first league start 4 days later, at home against FC Volendam. Saymak completed the full 90 minutes, as PEC won the game 3–1. Saymak completed his first brace of his career, in a 5–0 home win over FC Dordrecht. Saymak was unable to clinch a definite place in PEC's starting line-up, but was seen as one of the squad's most exciting prospects for the future, as PEC won promotion to the 2012-13 Eredivisie by winning the league. Saymak finished the season with 3 goals in 17 league games and 5 league starts. 2012–13 season Saymak made most of his league appearances in the 2012–13 season as a sub, as PEC secured safety from relegation surprisingly easy. Similarly to the previous season, Saymak finished with 17 league games and 5 league starts, in which he scored 1 goal. 2013–14 season The 2013–14 season was Mustafa's breakthrough season. With the departure of Youness Mokhtar (FC Twente) and Denni Avdic (AZ), Saymak took the opportunity to clinch a place on the wing in PEC's starting line-up. Saymak started the first 10 league games of the season, with assists against Heracles Almelo (1), Ajax (1) and ADO Den Haag (1), with also scoring a brace in the latter, as PEC was riding high in 3rd place after 10 league games. The game against ADO Den Haag (6–1 home win) also saw Saymak play in a different role than usual, being used as an attacking midfielder, as opposed to his usual role as a winger. His run of games ended as he missed the home game against AZ with an ankle injury and the third round cup-game for the KNVB Beker against Wilhelmina '08, but he was re- instated in the starting line-up in the following game against PSV. Saymak had a significant role in a rampant PEC, that drew praise for their excellent passing game and attacking play. PEC also reached unprecedented heights in the cup, as the club from Zwolle surprisingly reached the final of the KNVB Beker, against league champions Ajax. The biggest surprise was yet to come, as Saymak started for PEC in a dominating 5–1 win, securing European football for the first time in the club's history and more importantly, securing the club's first major trophy. Saymak finished the season with 30 league appearances, including 29 league starts, in which he scored 6 league goals and was responsible for 6 league assists. 2014–15 season Saymak started the season on a positive note, as PEC defeated Ajax 1–0 to win the 2014 Johan Cruijff Schaal. Saymak started the game and completed the full 90 minutes. Saymak scored his first league goal of the season on 16 August 2014, by scoring an injury-time winner in the away game against FC Dordrecht. International career Saymak was born in the Netherlands to parents of Turkish descent. He originally played for various Dutch youth teams. In February 2013, Saymak was called up to the Turkish under-20 team for the a match against Uzbekistan. He has since been called up and capped by the Netherlands U21 team.

He also served a seven-year stint as governor of Medina in 695–702, during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Abd al- Malik. Biography Aban was a son of Uthman ibn Affan, the third Rashidun caliph.Zetterstéen 1960, p. 2.Al-Tabari, ed. Landau-Tasserson 1998, p. 59, n. 263. His mother was Umm Amr bint Jundab ibn Amr al-Dawsiyya of the Azd tribe of Yemen.Ahmed 2010, p. 127.Ahmed 2010, p. 115. During the First Fitna, which occurred in the wake of his father’s assassination, Aban fought alongside the forces of A'isha and his Umayyad kinsmen against Caliph Ali (r. 656–661) at the Battle of the Camel in November 656. As A'isha's supporters were on the verge of defeat, Aban fled the battle. Later, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) appointed Aban governor of Medina in 695 and he continued in the post until being replaced by Hisham ibn Isma'il al-Makhzumi in 702. During his term, he led the funeral prayers, as was customary of the governor, for Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, a son of Ali and leader of the Alid family. He became incapacitated in 722/23 and died in Medina the following year, in 723/24, during the reign of Caliph Yazid II.Zetterstéen 1960, p. 3. Aban does not appear to have been a major political operative of the Umayyads and owes most of his fame for his knowledge of Islamic tradition.Zetterstéen 1960, pp. 2–3. He is credited by a number of scholars for authoring the Maghazi (biography) of Muhammad, though the historians Yaqut al-Hamawi and Ahmad al- Tusi credit this work to a certain Aban ibn Uthman ibn Yahya. Descendants Aban had at least two wives. His first, Umm Sa'id bint Abd al-Rahman, a granddaughter of al-Harith ibn Hisham, belonged to the Banu Makhzum clan. She mothered two of Aban's sons, his eldest Sa'id and Abd al-Rahman, and a daughter. His second wife, Umm Kulthum bint Abd Allah was a granddaughter of Ja'far ibn Abi Talib.Ahmed 2010, p. 128. The names of the descendants of Aban have been recorded in the historical record up to at least 1375 in Egypt, where some of his descendants moved. Others are recorded in the sources in al- Andalus, including his grandson Uthman ibn Marwan and the latter's great- grandson Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad.

T Delport (attorney) appeared for the plaintiffs, and SM Mbenenge SC (with CTS Cossie) for the defendants. The case has important implications for civil procedure in South Africa, with its determination that, although a voluntary association may, under the Uniform Rules of Court,Rule 14(2). sue or be sued in own name, this does not confer locus standi on the association where locus standi is otherwise lacking. The court also held that whether or not an association amounts to a universitas is to be determined with reference to its nature and object and activities. A written constitution is in this regard desirable but not essential. Where the association is formed for a limited purpose, and would cease to exist once that purpose has been achieved, it lacks the object to have perpetual succession and to hold property separate from its members; it also lacks the essential element of a universitas.  Facts  In an action in the High Court for damages for breach of contract, after a separation of issues, the court was asked to determine the question of the locus standi of the first plaintiff, described in the particulars as a voluntary association whose objective was \\"to represent its members in regard to their rights and interests emanating from their employment by and the closure of the Transkei Road Transport Corporation and to jointly institute legal proceedings to achieve\\" that objective. The plaintiff had no written constitution. The defendant argued that the plaintiff lacked locus standi, because * it was not a universitas; * it did not have a constitution; and * it did not have a direct and substantial interest in the subject-matter of the action. Conversely, the plaintiffs argued that the first plaintiff was able to sue in its own name by virtue of the provisions of rule 14(2) of the Uniform Rules of Court. (Rule 14(1) defines a \\"firm\\" as \\"a business, including a business carried on by [...] the sole proprietor thereof under a name other than his own name,\\" while Rule 14(2) allows such a firm to sue or be sued in its own name.)  Judgment  The court held that rule 14(2) was nothing more than a procedural aid, in that it assisted a plaintiff to cite certain legal entities that did not have any existence separate from their members or owners.Para 15. It did not turn a partnership, a firm or an unincorporated association into a different entity that existed separate from its members; nor did it vest it with locus standi where such was otherwise absent.Para 16. There was no merit, the court found, in the submission that the first plaintiff could not be a universitas because it did not possess a written constitution. Although advisable, it was not essential for a universitas to have a constitution. Accordingly, the mere fact that the first plaintiff had no written constitution was not determinative of the question of whether or not it had locus standi.Paras 18-19. Whether or not the first plaintiff was a universitas, therefore, had to be decided with regard to its nature, its object and it activities. From a reading of the particulars of claim, it was clear to the court that the rights and interests referred to were those arising from a contract entered into between the defendant and a labour union (the Transport and General Workers Union) representing persons who were employed by the said corporation prior to its dissolution. The conclusion was inescapable: The first plaintiff was formed for a very limited purpose; once that purpose was achieved, there would be no further need for it, and it would cease to exist. The very object of the association negated an intention that it would have perpetual succession and hold property separate from its members. It was clearly unnecessary for the achievement of its purpose to possess those characteristics. The first plaintiff consequently lacked the requisites for a universitas.Para 20. The court held that an association could sue on behalf of its members under rule 14(2) only if there existed a sufficient nexus between the individual members, in their capacities as members of the association, and the right that formed the subject-matter of the litigation. Applied to the present matter, the first plaintiff did not institute the present proceedings to protect or enforce an interest which it had as a body or organisation; it did not propose to enforce those rights of its members which they possessed by reason of their membership of the association. The right to claim damages from the defendant for the alleged breach of contract was a personal right; it vested in each member of the association individually.Para 25. The plaintiffs, in deciding jointly to pursue their claims against the defendant, were consequently not an \\"association\\" of persons within the meaning of that word. Their intention was rather, having regard to the purpose of the first plaintiff and the nature of the relief claimed, to use the first plaintiff as a convenient vehicle to bring a representative action. Such an action did not exist in South African civil procedure.Para 26. The court concluded that it had not been shown on the pleadings that the first plaintiff had locus standi. The defendant's objection in that regard had to be upheld.Para 30. The defendant's objection to the locus standi of the first plaintiff was consequently upheld and the first plaintiff's claims dismissed.Para 35.

Much of his work takes the form of large, colorful geometric abstractions. His paintings have been widely exhibited and are held in several important collections. Life Freddy Rodríguez was born in Santiago de los Caballeros in the Dominican Republic in 1945. His family were artists. Rodríguez immigrated to the United States in 1963 at the age of eighteen. In New York he spent much time at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was particularly interested in the work of Piet Mondrian. He studied painting at the Art Students League of New York and The New School, and obtained a degree in textile design from the Fashion Institute of Technology. In the 1980s he joined with several other Dominican visual artists including Bismark Victoria, Eligio Reynoso, Magno Laracuente and Tito Canepa to form the \\"Dominican Visual Artists of New York\\". This group succeeded in obtaining sponsorship for exhibitions of Dominican Art in popular locations. In 1991 the New York Foundation for the Arts named him \\"Gregory Millard Fellow in Painting\\". In 1992 he was a NYSCA Artist in Residence at El Museo del Barrio. Work Rodríguez was influenced by Rembrandt, Paul Cézanne and Piet Mondrian. His style incorporates elements of Abstract Expressionism, Pop and Minimalism. In 2011 the Smithsonian American Art Museum acquired three of his early works, painted in the early 1970s. Tall and narrow, the abstract paintings named Danza Africana, Amor Africano and Danza de Carnaval represent the energy of Dominican music through vibrant colors and zigzagging lines. A reviewer has discussed the political messages in his work, mourning the impact of colonialism and subsequent dictatorships on the original Caribbean paradise, saying, \\"The political messages are subsumed by the artist's desire to create beautiful paintings fusing Renaissance and modern traditions. Integrating illusionistic space with flattened surfaces, and contrasting loose and tight brushstrokes, the artist enters a dialogue with centuries of art concerned with these same pictorial issues.\\" Exhibitions In 1994, Rodríguez's work was shown as part of the American contingent at the IV Bienal Internacional de Pintura en Cuenca, Ecuador. Other American artists exhibiting at this show were Donald Locke, Philemona Williamson, Whitfield Lovell and Emilio Cruz. His works were exhibited in the Jersey City Museum between 13 December 1995 and 17 February 1996 in a show called Priest: The Spirit and the Flesh.

Also on the projection used (radial projection on the plane vs. projection on a geoid), there is no objectively correct way of finding \\"the centre of Asia\\". Thus, several places claim to host this hypothetical centre. The first official declaration of the Centre of Asia was made in the 1890s by the British traveller, and calculated to be near the Manor house of Estate of Safyanov in Saldam (modern Tuva, Russia) at .

Card-Catlin (August 5, 1846 – December 7, 1925) was an artist and educator credited with developing Erie, Pennsylvania’s art community. Early life and career Lovisa Card was born in Gainesville, New York to William Merritt and Eliza Wheel Card.Steehler, Kirk W. and Karen Dolan, \\"Lovisa Card Catlin 1846-1925, Cornerstone of Erie Art History,\\" Journal of Erie Studies, Fall 1989, vol. 18, No. 2. Though not much is known about her early life, it is generally accepted she left home at the age of sixteen. By 1868, she had taken up residence with an aunt and uncle, Jehiel and Hannah Towner, in Erie, Pennsylvania. Lovisa opened a small art studio in the family home before opening the Erie Art School in the 1870s. Located on the second floor of the Erie Dime Saving and Loan Building, the school was the first of its kind in the city and came to include nearly one hundred students. In her classes Lovisa stressed realism, teaching students to use their tools in order to enhance their own innate abilities.Shields Freeman, Sabina and Margaret L. Tenpas, \\" Erie History-The Women’s Story,\\" Benet Press for Erie, Pennsylvania Branch of American Association of University Women. Her students included Ruth E. Newton, Ruth Halleck, Gretchen Newberger, Charles A. Hulbert, Elizabeth Spalding, and Inez Wagner. During this time, she also studied at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming a life member. After the death of her mother and aunt, it is likely Lovisa took a break from teaching and the Erie Dime Saving and Loan Building was closed. By 1893, Lovisa married the widower Henry Catlin, a noted abolitionist and man of culture who was previously married to her cousin, Ellen Towner. The couple relocated and Lovisa returned to teaching, opening the Catlin School of Art in her home studio. Art Club In 1898, nineteen members of the community, many of them Lovisa’s former students, came together in the Catlin home to establish Erie’s first Art Club; an institution that would form the foundations for the Erie Art Museum. The club’s self-declared mission was: \\"The advancement of art by the elevation of its standards, by encouraging every form of art enterprise, by creating a more intelligent appreciation of art products, and by the cultivation of a spirit of fraternity among art students.\\" Lovisa was elected the club’s first president, a position which she held until 1922. The Art Club met in the classrooms of Erie Academy until the Public Library building opened in 1899. The club’s first exhibition featured 321 works from local artists. They also sponsored outside exhibitions of noteworthy American artists. Paintings hung for one month and exhibitions were free to the public.\\"Art and Artists in Erie,\\" The Erie Magazine, Volume III, No. 8, August 1914. With each show, the Art Club would purchase one or more works for its permanent collection. One of the first purchases included work from H. Bolton Jones and F. S. Church.Miller, J, \\"A 20th Century History of Erie County, PA.\\" History of Erie County, Chicacgo, 1909, Vol. 1. Later life On June 19, 1903, Henry Catlin died at home after he was stricken with a bout of rheumatism. With his passing, Lovisa focused her attention on bringing art programming to Erie, raising membership, and building the club’s permanent collection. After her brother also died, Lovisa spent two years traveling in Europe where she studied with Henri Martin and attended classes at The Academie Colarossi and The Académie de la Grande Chaumière. Coincidentally, Lovisa was among the visitors at The Louvre on the day Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa was stolen. Upon her return to Erie, Lovisa was awarded honorary membership to the Woman’s Club of Erie. She was also posthumously named one of the twelve greatest women in Erie history by the Business and Professional Women’s Club in 1931. Well into her seventies, Lovisa continued to build exhibitions with the Art Club. In 1923, she helped institute the Art Club’s first regular exhibition of local artists This exhibition continues today as the Annual Spring Show at the Erie Art Museum. Scholarship Fund Lovisa died at her home on December 7, 1925. She and Henry had no children. As part of her will, the Card-Catlin Art Scholarship was created for the continuing education of fine art, industrial arts, and architecture students. Noteworthy winners include Erie artists Joseph Plavcan and Richard Anuszkiewicz. Today the scholarship continues to support students of the arts through the Erie Community Foundation.

Upon finding that he could not afford the fee for the ferry, he became depressed, and, according to his wife, stayed awake for two days, but eventually he decided to return to Parit Six. On October 9 he and his family went to Labis by bus, where they boarded the mail train from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.Police close on killer: 10 now dead, The Singapore Free Press (October 11, 1947)9 killed, 12 wounded in amok's orgy of killing, The Straits Times (October 11, 1947) For most of the journey 30-year- old Utoh remained quiet, but at about 6:10 p.m., when the train had just passed Bangi and was on its way to Kajang, he entered the restaurant car, drew a pocket knife with a four-inch blade and attacked four British Other Ranks of the Malaya Command Signals Regiment, who were having dinner at one of the tables.

Upon being asked why he had returned, since it was thought that he was on his way to Sumatra, he told that he had no money for the trip and was on his way back home, but he had lost his wife and children when he was pushed out of the train after a fight that was incited by a Chinese boy who had spilt tea on him. Utoh was then brought to Sabak Bernam Police Station where he related his story, telling that he couldn't remember anything that happened after he was pushed off the train. One of the policemen, who had read the story about the mass murder in a newspaper, suspected that he could be the sought culprit, and so Utoh was arrested. Utoh was detained in Teluk Anson, where he was identified by his wife, and charged with the murder of Herbert Marston on October 13.

There was no question of separate legal entities, but clearly an incorrect description of the original plaintiff, which mistake could be cured by the proposed amendment to the description of the plaintiff.

He worked in the United States as an outreach assistant at the Sojourners Community and as a youth coordinator at Tearfund.Marvin Rees Biography, BBC News, 2 March 2005. =Political career= In 2012, selected by an individual ballot of Labour Party members in the city to stand for Mayor of Bristol, Rees defeated four other candidates including the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Labour group in Bristol and a former Member of Parliament. He received 25,906 votes, coming second, after George Ferguson. Rees found it difficult readjusting to normal life following his election loss. Rees was again selected to be the Labour candidate for the 2016 mayoral election, easily defeating a sitting Labour councillor in the selection. On 5 May 2016, Rees was elected Mayor of Bristol. He received 56,729 votes in the first round and 12,021 transfer votes in the second round, meaning that he received 68,750 votes overall.\\"Labour's Marvin Rees has been elected as Bristol city's mayor\\", BBC News, Bristol, 7 May 2016. He is often referred to as the first black mayor of African descent in the UK. Although Dr Allan Glaisyer Minns and John Archer were both elected black mayors in the UK in the 20th century. Rees is the first directly elected (by constituents) black mayor in the UK, and although he is not the first directly elected black mayor in Europe, as Peter Bossman has been mayor of the Slovenian city of Piran (population 3,700) since 2010, he is the first directly elected mayor of African descent of a major European city. Bristol is one of the UK's core cities, with a population of 463,400. Rees's term of office started with an inherited £30 million budget shortfall from the previous administration and a £60 million budget deficit from government funding reductions to 2020, and in August 2016 Rees instigated a voluntary severance programme aimed at reducing, by 1,000, the council's 6,970 employees. Rees's mayoralty included a major house building programme, with over 9,000 homes built during his term of office. Under his leadership, the city increased the percentage of affordable homes as well as embarking on the first major development of council houses. Rees oversaw the founding of a city owned housing company, Goram Homes, created to develop and build homes, re- investing profits to the development of affordable and social housing.\\"Council officially launches Goram Homes\\", Bristol City Council, 29 October 2018. One area of perceived controversy was Rees's decision in September 2018 not to build the long-awaited Bristol Arena by Temple Meads Station, in the centre of Bristol. The episode brought discussion about the authority of a city mayor to make autonomous decisions in the face of strong opposition, and concerns were raised at how businesses are able to influence those with decision making and planning powers in cities. The primary reasons Rees gave for the decision were build cost, future financial risk and job creation. The build cost for the council, that would have to be borrowed, had increased to £150 million plus half of any cost overruns. Costs arising should the arena not be successful would be to the council, and expert advice was that the venue size was too small for major events. Rees also argued a mixed use development would create more and better paid jobs. In September 2017, Rees was placed at Number 78 in \\"The 100 Most Influential People on the Left\\" by commentator Iain Dale. The empty pedestal of the alt=The pedestal is seen with purple spraypaint graffiti \\"BLM\\" over two of the bronze plaques and black \\"Black Lives Matter\\" and stencilled raised fists on the plinth. Placards propped on the pedestal include \\"Black Lives Matter\\", \\"Silence is Violence\\", \\"The UK is not innocent\\" and \\"In unity is strength\\". Many more placards lie on the ground around the pedestal, with \\"Black Lives Matter\\",\\"Racism is a global pandemic\\" and other slogans. In March 2019, Mayor Rees vetoed the installation of a second plaque to the statue of the Bristol-born merchant Edward Colston as he rejected the proposed wording as failing to adequately describe Colston's role in the slave trade and merchant history of Bristol. In the 2020 Powerlist, Rees was listed in the Top 100 of the most influential people in the UK of African/African- Caribbean descent. In the aftermath of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, in police custody, global Black Lives Matter protests were held around the world. In Bristol, protestors forcibly removed the statue of Edward Colston and dropped it into the harbour. The statue was recovered from the harbour by Bristol City Council, and Rees announced it would end up in a Bristol museum, where the full history of the statue could be told. The events placed Bristol in the forefront of global news, including the major news channels in the UK and US. Rees announced a new commission on Bristol's history, so that there could be a wider understanding of the city's history, including struggles on class, race and gender. Rees was due to be subject to re-election in May 2020 but the election was delayed for 12 months, due to the global coronavirus pandemic. The mayoral election is due to take place in May 2021. Personal life Marvin Rees describes himself as the mixed-race son of a Jamaican father and white single mother, and was born and grew up in Bristol. He is married with three children and lives in Easton in Bristol.Ian Onions, \\"Labour's Marvin Rees wins election to become Bristol's next mayor\\" , Bristol Post, 7 May 2016. = Documentary film = In 2018 a documentary film was released with a premiere at Watershed, Bristol, about Rees's journey into politics and his two campaigns for the city's top political job. The Mayor's Race was filmed between 2011 and 2017, covering Rees's two mayoral campaigns in 2012 and 2016 as well as Bristol's historical issues of race and racism—including the 1963 bus boycott, the 1980 St. Pauls riot, and transatlantic slavery.

It is situated on the A489 road and the River Camlad. The English border is immediately to the east of the village. The small town of Bishop's Castle is to the south.Ordnance Survey mapping A monastery existed here c. 1200, before moving to Chirbury by 1227.Chirbury Priory The small St Mary's Church of Snead is uniquely positioned on the banks of the River Camlad. Recent archeological investigations have shown that 11th century dwellings or buildings formally existed very close to the church. A village of Snead was possibly built with the church in its midst, or perhaps it was built as the Chapel of the Priory founded hereabouts in the 12th century by Lord of Montgomery, Robert de Buthlers. The Priory was later moved to Chirbury. Not much larger than a chapel, the church has a small belfry, where medieval bells have recently been restored to their positions. The church is surrounded by a small raised churchyard with retaining walls and ditches. This indicates that it is an ancient site where a wooden church may have been built before the first stone building of the 13th/14th century. The churchyard contains several Yew trees, one ancient. The grassland contains many species which indicate that the ground may have been undisturbed for centuries. A close look at the south wall of the church, where the present entrance is located, shows that there may at one time have been an outdoor preaching platform. This could be attributable to the Augustinian monks who founded the Priory, as they were known to preach outdoors. On the north window are two unusual faces carved in stone. Much of the north and west of the church was rebuilt on 1870. Inside it is mostly undecorated, with bare stone walls. There is a Victorian screen and pulpit (part of which is much older). The Victorian floor tiling remains in good condition. The font, dated 12th century, could have been a relic of the former Priory. This was not originally made as a font, but as a quern - a vessel for corn or liquid with a pouring lip on the edge of the rim. In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Snead like this: 'SNEAD, a parish in the district of Clun and county of Montgomery; 2 miles NNW of Bishops-Castle r[ailway]. station. Post town, Bishops-Castle, Shropshire. Acres, 644. Real property, £742. Pop[ulation]., 59. Houses, 10. The property is subdivided. The living is a rectory, annexed to Hyssington. The church is bad.'

Life  John was the son of Simon of Saarbrücken-Commercy (d. 1325), son of John I (fr) (b. 1265 - 1341/42), Count of Saarbrücken. His mother was Marguerite of Savoy-Vaud (d. 1313),FMG: Marguerite of Savoy-Vaud a daughter of Louis I of Vaud, married with Simon in 1309. 1326, before the death of John II's grandfather, Count John I, the inheritance was divided. John was awarded the County of Saarbrücken and a small part of Commercy, called \\"Saarbrücken\\" or \\"Château bas\\". The larger part of Commercy, called \\"Château haut\\", went to his uncle John II (Jean II) (fr), as \\"Seigneur of Commercy\\", of the house of Saarbrücken-Commercy. One of his sons was Jean III. Like his father Simon, John II supported France in the war against England. During the Battle of Poitiers 1356, both John II and King John II of France were taken prisoner by the English. He was held in Wallingford Castle until 1360. In 1362, he fought against gangs of mercenaries near Lyon and was briefly taken prisoner again. John II undertook several diplomatic missions in the service of the French King. In 1362, he travelled to the court of Emperor Charles IV and in the following years, he travelled to the English court several times. In 1364, he was appointed Grand Butler of France as a reward for his services. In 1370 John was appointed chairman of the Court of Finances. In 1371, he received the Lordship of Vaucouleurs. In 1380, John II retired from the French court. He died in 1381. As he had no sons, his daughter Johanna inherited the County of Saarbrücken. However, she died later that year, and the county fell to her son Philipp I of Nassau-Weilburg. Various lines of the House of Nassau would hold the county until it was conquered by France in 1795.  Marriage and issue  Latest in 1334, John II married Ghislette (d. 1356/62), a daughter of Peter of Bar (d.c. 1348), Lord of Pierrefort, son of Theobald II, Count of Bar. Ghiselette's mother was Jeanne of Vienne (d.b. 1326), daughter of Hugues of Vienne (d. 1307?), Sire of Longwy and Pagny (or Philipp I, Count of Vianden?). John and Ghislette had one daughter: * Johanna (d. 1381), married in 1353 to John I, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1309 – 1371), and had several children. Formally she succeeded briefly as Countess of Saarbrücken, and as regent of Nassau-Weilburg for her young son, and the House of Nassau-Saarbrücken followed, with their son:  Philipp I, Count of Nassau-Saarbrücken-Weilburg (1368 – 1429), who reigned both the County of Nassau-Weilburg and the County of Saarbrücken. He married Anna of Hohenlohe-Weikersheim (d. 1410), and Elisabeth of Lorraine-Vaudémont (c. 1395 – 1456) and had several children. At Philipps death in 1429, the counties were ruled jointly by his eldest sons, with their mother Elisabeth as regent until 1442, then it was divided between them: *Philip II of Nassau-Weilburg (1418 – 1492), Count and founder of the line Nassau-Weilburg.

History The first English-language passports of the Korean Empire were issued in 1902 by the People's Comfort Agency (; 綏民院) to Koreans migrating to Hawaii. By 1904, passport issuance was conducted by the Imperial Korean Foreign Office (). The passport was written in English, French, and Classical Chinese, and contained the bearer's name, address, age, and destination. Soon after the 1910 advent of Japanese rule in Korea, Koreans began having to use Japanese passports. These were not always easy to obtain; the Japanese rulers issued then as a rule only to a small number of pro- Japanese collaborators () and/or the Japanese police demanded bribes for these passports to be issued. Even these were in fact colonial subject passports just like BN(O) passports and a special permit was required to travel to Japan (abolished only at the end of Japanese rule when the Allied naval blockade disabled travels from/to Japan anyway) Thus, some Koreans resorted to naturalising as citizens of China and acquiring Republic of China passports instead. However, for those aiming to travel to the United States this method created its own difficulties, as the bearers of such passports then became subject to the provisions of the United States' Chinese Exclusion Act. Other Koreans with connections to the Shanghai Exile Government were able to obtain travel documents from there; however, its acceptance was guaranteed as the Shanghai Exile Government was only recognized by the then Republic of China(now Taiwanese) government. Once Korea became liberated by the US, the interim Korean administration re-issued the Jipjo. Surviving examples of Korean Empire passports are rare. One specimen is the passport of An Cheol- yeong, preserved by his son An Hyeong-ju of Hawaii; in 2012, the younger An donated that passport and his collection of nearly 2,500 other documents of Korean American history to the National Library of Korea in Seoul. Another specimen is the passport issued in 1903 to diplomat Min Yonghwan, which is held by the Soongsil University Museum.

It is native to South America, and it is well known in other places as an introduced species and noxious weed, particularly in Hawaii. This is a perennial grass growing up to 1.5 meters tall. It branches near the top of the stem, producing a wide, loose inflorescence up to 40 centimeters long. This grass is very common in the dry woodlands of Hawaii. It competes with native vegetation, displacing it and forming thick monotypic stands. These stands become very flammable and increase the frequency of fire.D'Antonio, C. M., et al. (2011).

He was first elected in District 12 in 2010, which then included Angelina, San Jacinto, Trinity, and Tyler counties. He resides in Hillister in Tyler County. Background Born and reared in Houston, Texas, White attended public school and graduated in 1982 from Lamar High School. In 1986, White procured a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science and Military Science from the historically black Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical University in Prairie View, Texas. From 1986 until 1992, he served in the United States Army as a commissioned officer in the infantry. Thereafter, he taught in the public school system in the Houston area and was a guest columnist for Headway Magazine. Later, White became a teacher at Woodville High School in Woodville, the county seat of Tyler County. He also owns a cattle ranch. He is a member of the Hillister Baptist Church. In 2000, he obtained a Master of Education degree from Prairie View. In 2010 and 2012, respectively, he received a Master of Science and a Ph.D. from the University of Houston. White is a member of the American Foreign Legion, the Masonic lodge, the National Rifle Association, the historically black fraternity Omega Psi Phi, the Farm Bureau, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. He is a board member of the Texas Federation of Republican Outreach. Political life Running in House District 12 in 2010, White unseated the Democratic incumbent, Jim McReynolds, 20,958 (57.6 percent) to 15,405 (42.4 percent). Switched to District 19 in 2012, White unseated in the Republican primary the 10-year incumbent Mike \\"Tuffy\\" Hamilton of Lumberton in Hardin County. White polled 10,190 votes (54.5 percent) to Hamilton's 8,503 (45.5 percent). White then ran without Democratic opposition in the general election held on November 6, 2012. In the 2013 legislative session, White voted to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure was approved 96-49. He co-sponsored companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers. In 2016, the Texas law was struck down as unconstitutional. Texas Right to Life rated White 78 percent favorable in 2013 and 74 percent in 2011. White opposed the taxpayer-funded breakfast program for public schools; the measure passed the House, 73-58. He supported legislation to provide marshals for school security. He voted against the bill to require immunization of minors without parental consent, a measure which the House nevertheless approved, 71-61. He co-sponsored the law to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain businesses. White opposed the measure to prohibit texting while driving. He voted to require testing for narcotics of those receiving unemployment compensation. He voted against an \\"equal pay for women\\" measure, which passed the House, 78-61. He voted to forbid the state from enforcing federal regulations of firearms and in support of another law allowing college and university officials to carry concealed weapons in the name of campus security. He voted for the redistricting bills for the state House, the Texas Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. He voted against term limits for certain officials. In 2013, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party, rated White 93 percent favorable. Young Conservatives of Texas ranked him 80 percent. The interest group, Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, founded by Michael Quinn Sullivan, assigned White a score of 91 percent in 2013 and 100 percent in 2011. The Texas Association of Business gave him an 87 percent score in 2013. He ranked 53 percent from the Texas League of Conservation Voters and 92 percent from the National Rifle Association. In 2017, White introduced the Texas Hero Protection Act, which would impose fines and jail time upon those who remove monuments and buildings named for Texas war heroes, including those who fought for the Confederate States of America. The measure would also protect African-American monuments, such as those of Buffalo soldiers. Current law establishes no penalties for removal of monuments and does not designate a legal procedure by which to move or remove monuments.Sig Christenson, \\"Legislator targeting removals of monuments,\\" San Antonio Express-News, April 2, 2017, p. 3. In the general election held on November 6, 2018, White overwhelmed his Democratic opponent, Sherry Williams, 49,926 (83.2 percent) to 10,070 (16.8 percent).

Hugh LaFollette (Blackwell Publishing, 2012). It covers two areas. The first is the ethics of process (or the ethics of office), which deals with public officials and the methods they use.Hampshire, Stuart (ed.). Public and Private Morality (Cambridge University Press, 1978). ; and Thompson, Dennis F. Political Ethics and Public Office (Harvard University Press, 1987). The second area, the ethics of policy (or ethics and public policy) concerns judgments about policies and laws.Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson. Ethics and Politics: Cases and Comments, 4th edition (Nelson-Hall, 2006). ; Bluhm, William T., and Robert A. Heineman. Ethics and Public Policy: Method and Cases (Prentice Hall, 2007). ; and Wolff, Jonathan. Ethics and Public Policy: A Philosophical Inquiry (Routledge, 2011). The concept political morality can be easily understood when knowing what the roots of the term are and the gradual development. The values and expectations of political morality are derived from the principles of justice. John Rawls defends the proposed idea that political conception of justice is ultimately based on not only the values those are expected to follow, but most importantly, the common good of an individual. Leung, Cheuk-Hang (2016-02-08). \\"Cultivating Political Morality for Deliberative Citizens — Rawls and Callan Revisited\\". Educational Philosophy and Theory. 48 (14): 1426–1441. doi:10.1080/00131857.2016.1138393. ISSN 0013-1857. Ethics of process Niccolò Machiavelli is one of the most famous (or infamous) political theorists that spoke on, and later subverted, the matters of political ethics. Unlike Aristotle, he believed that a political leader may be required to behave in evil ways if necessary to maintain his authority. In contemporary democracies, a variant of this idea has been reframed as the problem of dirty hands, described most influentially by Michael Walzer, who argues that the problem creates a paradox: the politician must sometimes do “wrong to do right”.Walzer, Michael. “Political Action: The Problem of Dirty Hands,” Philosophy & Public Affairs 2 (1973), pp. 160-80. The politician uses violence to prevent greater violence, but his act is still wrong even if justified. Walzer’s view has been criticized.Paul, Rynard, and David P. Shugarman (eds.). Cruelty & Deception: The Controversy over Dirty Hands in Politics (Broadview Press, 2000). Some critics object that either the politician is justified or not. If justified, there is nothing wrong, though he may feel guilty. Others say that some of the acts of violence that Walzer would allow are never justified, no matter what the ends. Dennis Thompson has argued that in a democracy citizens should hold the leader responsible, and therefore if the act is unjustified their hands are dirty too.Thompson, Dennis F. “Democratic Dirty Hands,” in Political Ethics and Public Office (Harvard University Press, 1987), pp. 11-39. In large organizations it is often not possible to tell who is actually responsible for the outcomes—a problem known as the problem of many hands. Political ethics not only permits leaders to do things that would be wrong in private life, but requires them to meet higher standards than would be necessary in private life. For example, they may have less of a right of privacy than do ordinary citizens, and no right to use their office for personal profit. The major issues here ultimately concern the concept of conflict of interest.Stark, Andrew. Conflict of Interest in American Public Life. (Harvard University Press, 2003). As stated above, personal or private morality and political morality is often viewed as a conflict of interest. However, it is important to know that these two concepts of morality can also maintain a common positive relationship between the two. Whether an individual is involved in the political domain as an authority or as an active civic participant, these values bleed through to the personal sector of morality as well. An individual that learned the skills necessary in the political sector may apply these learned qualities in a setting outside of politics, often viewed as a private every day setting. In contrast, one that is entering the political setting may have already held the qualities and virtues that are expected in the professional setting. Therefore the values and skills already held will then be applied to the new political setting, as anticipated. Reciprocity, as in the context of deriving those traits are commonly present when entering the field, if the qualities were not already learned. Both concepts of morality include different expectations, but to say the least, there is a correlation present between the two. Whether the virtues and values were acquired or previously held, they simply factor in and apply to both settings. Those that have emerged into the intense political sphere, knowing that virtues and morals can certainly be an influence, but building one’s character can be substantially beneficial prior to the entrance. Mendeluk, Paulina (2018-06-29). \\"Public Sphere and the Political Morality in a Liberal Democracy\\". Analele Universităţii din Oradea, Seria Geografie. 29 (1). doi:10.30892/auog.24. ISSN 1221-1273. Ethics of policy Personal morality is also factored into public morality as discussed in the previous section. However, given the Liberal democracy present in the United States, public morality is often referred to as 'formal'. Abiding by the order of law, in addition maintaining respect are simply two critical factors in order to achieve the concept of public morality. These elements are expected when an individual is actively participating in the political sphere, and ultimately required for the behavior of political authorities.Deveaux, Monique (2002). \\"Political Morality and Culture\\". Social Theory and Practice. 28 (3): 503–518. doi:10.5840/soctheorpract200228322. ISSN 0037-802X. Each citizen has their own belief and morals toward a particular controversial topic, nonetheless it is the political authorities duty to respect others' belief and advocate for their constituents beliefs while following the law and constitution. Mendeluk, Paulina (2018-06-29). \\"Public Sphere and the Political Morality in a Liberal Democracy\\". Analele Universităţii din Oradea, Seria Geografie. 29 (1). doi:10.30892/auog.24. ISSN 1221-1273. In the other area of political ethics, the key issues are not the conflict between means and ends but the conflicts among the ends themselves. For example, in the question of global justice, the conflict is between the claims of the nation state and citizens on one side and the claims of all citizens of the world.Beitz, Charles. “Review Article: International Liberalism and Distributive Justice: A Survey of Recent Thought,” World Politics 51 (1999), pp. 269-296. Traditionally, priority has been given to the claims of nations, but in recent years thinkers known as cosmopolitans have pressed the claims of all citizens of the world. Political ethics deals not mainly with ideal justice, however, but with realizing moral values in democratic societies where citizens (and philosophers) disagree about what ideal justice is. In a pluralist society, how if at all can governments justify a policy of progressive taxation, affirmative action, the right to abortion, universal healthcare, and the like?For examples, see note 3 below. Political ethics is also concerned with moral problems raised by the need for political compromise, whistleblowing, civil disobedience, and criminal punishment. Criticisms Some critics (so called political realists) argue that ethics has no place in politics.Korab-Karpowicz, W. Julian. “Political Realism in International Relations,” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). If politicians are to be effective in the real world, they cannot be bound by moral rules. They have to pursue the national interest. However, Walzer points out that if the realists are asked to justify their claims, they will almost always appeal to moral principles of their own (for example, to show that ethics is harmful or counterproductive).Walzer, Michael. Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (Basic Books, 1977), pp. 4-13. Another kind of criticism comes from those who argue that we should not pay so much attention to politicians and policies but should instead look more closely at the larger structures of society where the most serious ethical problems lie.Barry, Brian. Why Social Justice Matters (Polity Press, 2005). Advocates of political ethics respond that while structural injustice should not be ignored, too much emphasis on structures neglects the human agents who are responsible for changing them.Thompson (1987), pp. 5-6.

Blitt creates his works in traditional pen and ink, as well as watercolors.  Early life and education  Blitt grew up in Côte Saint-Luc, Quebec, a municipality on the Island of Montreal. The artist's first publication credit came at age 16: a series of drawings in the Philadelphia Flyers 1974 yearbook. He graduated from The Ontario College of Art and Design in 1982 and moved to the US in 1989.  Work  Blitt first began drawing political cartoons at the Toronto Magazine. He worked for ten years at Entertainment Weekly drawing half-page celebrity cartoons. In 1993 Blitt began contributing to The New Yorker, Blitt's illustration work has also been featured by publications such as Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, The Atlantic and others. The artist is also well known for illustrating Frank Rich's Sunday op- ed column in The New York Times. Regarding that work, Rich is quoted as saying, \\"It's a long-distance collaboration – me in New York City, Barry in Connecticut – but one of the most satisfying I've had in my career.\\" Many of Blitt's New Yorker covers have been finalists for the Cover of the Year from the American Society of Magazine Editors, including, in 2008, Narrow Stance and I'll Get It!,First Anniversary in 2010, and The Book of Life in 2012.

A campaign spokesman for Senator John McCain also condemned the art. In the cover art, Obama is shown wearing traditional Muslim clothes, including sandals, robe and turban. His wife, Michelle is shown dressed in camouflage, combat boots and has an assault rifle over her shoulder. Behind them, an American flag is burning in the fireplace. Titled The Politics of Fear, the cover satirized the rumors about Obama and his wife as he ran for the presidency. The controversial art was covered by numerous media outlets including the Los Angeles Times, PBS and others. In defense of the art, Eric Bates of Rolling Stone was quoted as saying, \\"I don't think it (The New Yorker) crossed the line. I would question whether there's much of a line to be crossed. I think their intent was clear, but I think it's clear from the response that a lot of people didn't get the joke.\\" The New York Times called it the most memorable image of the 2008 presidential campaign, and Françoise Mouly, the Art Editor of the New Yorker, said she was \\"extremely proud\\" of the piece. Regarding the controversy, Blitt was quoted as saying \\"Anytime I produce a cover, I always regret it afterward\\". The cover art was parodied later the same year by Entertainment Weekly, with a photograph by Jake Chessum featuring Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. In spite of the controversy and condemnation by the Obama campaign, after taking office President Barack Obama chose one of Blitt's New Yorker covers to hang in the White House. The cover depicts the President picking the family dog at the same time as he is vetting candidates for his national security cabinet. Additionally, President Obama requested and received a signed New Yorker cover by the artist, which depicts the President walking on water.

He was closely associated with Erasmus and had a well-known literary feud with Thomas More. Early life Germain de Brie was born in Auxerre, France, where he first studied law. He then travelled widely, becoming a college friend of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim.Stanford University - Agrippa-Nettesheim From 1508 he studied under John Lascaris in Venice, at this time becoming a friend of Erasmus of Rotterdam. He was secretary of the bishop of Albi, Lois de Amboise, and later of the French statesman Jean de Ganay. After the death of Jean de Ganay in 1512, de Brie sought the patronage of the French queen Anne of Brittany, which he achieved by writing what became his most famous work, Chordigerae navis conflagratio (\\"The Burning of the Ship Cordelière\\") (1512), a Latin poem about the recent destruction of the Breton flagship Cordelière in the Battle of Saint-Mathieu between the French and English fleets. It was translated into French for Anne by Pierre Choque.Jennifer Britnell, \\"Court Poets of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany\\" in Sarah Alyn Stacey (ed). Court and Humour in the French Renaissance: Essays in Honour of Professor Pauline Smith, Peter Lang, 2009, p.50. Controversy with Thomas More An illustration to de Brie's poem, depicting the Cordelière on fire, with the Regent behind. The poem led to a literary controversy with the English scholar and statesman Sir Thomas More, in part because it contained criticisms of English leaders, but also because of its hyperbolic account of the bravery of the Breton captain Hervé de Portzmoguer. In his epigrams addressed to de Brie, More ridiculed the poem's description of \\"Hervé fighting indiscriminately with four weapons and a shield; perhaps the fact slipped your mind, but your reader ought to have been informed in advance that Hervé had five hands. Stung by More's attacks, de Brie wrote an aggressive reply, the Latin verse satire Antimorus (1519), including an appendix which contained a \\"page-by-page listing of the mistakes in More's poems\\".Peter G. Bietenholz, Thomas Brian Deutscher, Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation, Volume 1, University of Toronto Press, 2003, p.200. Sir Thomas immediately wrote another hard-hitting pamphlet, Letter against Brixius, but Erasmus intervened to calm the situation, and persuaded More to stop the sale of the publication and let the matter drop. Later work Appointed Archdeacon of Albi, de Brie also held other lucrative ecclesiastical posts along with the role of secretary to queen Anne and almoner to the king. In 1522 de Brie returned to the study of Greek. He began translating into Latin the writings of the Greek theologian John Chrysostom, whose work he wished to make more readily available. Erasmus assisted him in this. Later, de Brie intervened in quarrels between Erasmus and other scholars, notably Guillaume Budé, occasioned by the publication of Erasmus's Ciceronianus. In 1536 he wrote an appreciative obituary for Erasmus. De Brie died in 1538.  Works  *Chordigerae navis conflagratio. Paris 1513 *Antimorus.

He was born c. 1132, and died of natural causes during a rebellion he raised against Andronikos I Komnenos in 1182. Background and family Emperor John II Komnenos and his wife Eirene, grandparents of John Komnenos Vatatzes, flanking the Virgin and Child John Komnenos Vatatzes was the son of the sebastohypertatos Theodore Vatatzes, and the porphyrogenita princess Eudokia Komnene, daughter of the emperor John II Komnenos and his empress Eirene of Hungary.Varzos, p. 382Magdalino, p. 207 Theodore Vatatzes was one of the 'new men' raised to prominence by John II; the Vatatzes family were not previously counted amongst the highest levels of the Byzantine aristocracy, though they had long been prominent in the region around the city of Adrianople in Thrace.Magdalino, p. 208 John's parents married in 1131, and he was born soon thereafter, probably ca. 1132. John had a brother, Andronikos, who was also a prominent general – he led an army against the city of Amaseia in 1176 and was killed by the Seljuq Turks; they displayed his severed head during the Battle of Myriokephalon shortly afterwards. He had another brother, named Alexios.Choniates, pp. 440–441. John's wife was named Maria Doukaina and they had two sons, Alexios and Manuel.Varzos, pp. 382–383 The latter was named for John's uncle, the Emperor Manuel, to whom John was very devoted—to the extent of tolerating a love affair between the emperor and his own sister Theodora.Varzos, p. 383 Military career in the reign of Manuel I John Komnenos Vatatzes enters contemporary sources as a senior general in the 1170s; it is certain that he served in lesser military capacities before being appointed to high command, but no record of his activities has survived. He undoubtedly had a military apprenticeship under his father Theodore, also a prominent general, who undertook the siege of Zemun on the Hungarian frontier in 1151, and captured the city of Tarsus in Cilicia in 1158.John Kinnamos, pp. 91 and 138 In 1176 Emperor Manuel Komnenos attempted to destroy the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, but was defeated at Myriokephalon. Following a truce which allowed the Byzantine army to retreat from Turkish territory, Manuel failed to implement all the conditions, particularly the destruction of border fortresses, demanded by the Seljuq sultan Kilij Arslan II as a prerequisite for a cessation of hostilities.Magdalino, p. 99Choniates, p. 108 The fortress of Soublaion was razed, but the more important fortification of Dorylaion was not. The sultan reacted by dispatching a substantial Seljuq cavalry army, numbering about 24,000 men, to ravage Byzantine territory in the Meander Valley in western Anatolia. John Komnenos Vatatzes was entrusted with command of a Byzantine army and set out from Constantinople with instructions to intercept the Seljuq raiders. Vatatzes was given Constantine Doukas and Michael Aspietes as lieutenants, and was able to reinforce his army through local recruitment as it moved through Byzantine territory.Choniates, pp. 108–109Birkenmeier, p. 196Varzos, pp. 383–384 Vatatzes intercepted the Seljuq army as it was returning to Turkish territory loaded with plunder from sacked Byzantine cities. He deployed his army to create a classic ambush, which was sprung when the Turks were in the process of crossing the Meander River, near the settlements of Hyelion and Leimocheir. The Seljuq army was almost helpless to defend itself and was destroyed; the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates stated that only a few out of many thousands escaped. The Seljuq commander, who held the title 'Atabeg', was killed as he attempted to fight his way out of the trap.Choniates, p. 110Varzos, p. 384 The battle was a significant victory for the Byzantines and it underlined how limited the immediate effects of the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon were on the empire's hold over its Anatolian possessions. The Byzantine victory was followed up by punitive expeditions against the Turcoman nomads settled around the upper Meander Valley.Angold, p. 193 Alexios II and rebellion When Vatatzes is again mentioned in the sources, in 1182, he is holding very high office: he was both megas domestikos, the commander in chief of the Byzantine army, and governor of the important Theme (province) of Thrace.Choniates, p. 138The previously separate Themes of Macedonia and Thrace were usually governed together in this period, with Adrianople (Theme of Macedonia) being the administrative centre. The city of Adrianople was both the seat of the government of Thrace and the centre of the landholdings of the Vatatzes family, and John is recorded as building and endowing fine almshouses and hospitals there.Magdalino, p. 153 Following the death of Emperor Manuel I in 1180 the succession fell to his son Alexios II Komnenos. As Alexios was a child, power devolved on his mother, the empress Maria of Antioch. Her rule proved unpopular, especially with the aristocracy who resented her Latin (Western) origins. When Manuel's cousin Andronikos Komnenos (Andronikos I) made a bid for power in early 1182 he wrote to John Vatatzes in an attempt to suborn him. Vatatzes recognised Andronikos as a potential tyrant and wrote back in insulting terms. Vatazes' cousin Andronikos Kontostephanos the commander of the navy, however, was deceived and played a key role in allowing Andronikos' forces to enter Constantinople. Once in power, Andronikos Komnenos proved that he had indeed a tyrannical nature and a vehement desire to break the power and influence of the Byzantine aristocratic families.Angold, p. 267 At the time, Vatatzes is recorded as residing near Philadelphia in western Anatolia; presumably he had been dismissed from his offices. As a member of the imperial family and a respected and successful general he had no difficulties in raising a substantial army when he openly rebelled against the new regime. Vatatzes upbraided Andronikos as a \\"demonic adversary\\" who was \\"intent on exterminating the imperial family.\\" The second accusation, at least, was an accurate assessment.Choniates, p. 146Angold, p. 267 Andronikos I sent the general Andronikos Lampardas (or Lapardas) against Vatatzes with a large force. Vatatzes, who had become seriously ill, met Lampardas' army near Philadelphia. He first instructed his sons Manuel and Alexios in how to array the army, then had himself carried to a hill where he could observe the battle from a litter. Vatatzes' forces were victorious and Lampardas' broken troops were pursued for some distance. However, a few days later, on 16 May 1182, Vatatzes died. Without his leadership the rebellion quickly broke apart, and Vatatzes' sons fled to the protection of the Seljuq sultan. When attempting to get to Sicily by sea they were wrecked on the coast of Crete and taken prisoner. They were then blinded on the orders of Andronikos I. Andronikos considered the death of Vatatzes as divine providence, and it emboldened him to declare himself co- emperor alongside Alexios.Choniates, pp. 146–147 Legacy John Komnenos Vatatzes is one of the few figures whose character is described with unalloyed admiration in the works of the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates.Magdalino, p. 13.

Sandoval is the lead case that successfully challenged Nevada's denial of same-sex marriage as mandated by that state's constitution and statutory law. The plaintiffs' complaint was initially filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada on April 10, 2012, on behalf of several couples denied marriage licenses. These couples challenged the denial on the basis of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. On November 26, 2012, Chief District Judge Robert Jones ruled against the plaintiff same-sex couples, granting in part a motion to dismiss the complaint against the Nevada government officials named in it. The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 3, 2012. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments in Sevcik and two related cases, Jackson v. Abercrombie and Latta v. Otter, on September 8, 2014. On October 7, the panel reversed the lower court's ruling in Sevcik, remanding the case back to district court with direction to enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. This effectively legalized same-sex marriage in Nevada. After at least one judge on the Court of Appeals asked for a vote on the defendants' petition to have the case reheard by a larger, 11-judge panel, a majority of judges on the Ninth Circuit did not agree; thus making the ruling final on January 9, 2015. Constitutional amendment The Constitution of Nevada was amended in 2002 to incorporate Article 1, Section 21, which reads: \\"Only a marriage between a male and female person shall be recognized and given effect in this state,\\" restricting marriage to different-sex couples. Voters first approved a ballot question endorsing this amendment to that effect on November 7, 2000, with 70% of the vote. Its principal sponsor was the Coalition to Protect Marriage, a local organization. Because Nevada requires a constitutional amendment be approved by the voters twice, Nevada voters considered the same ballot question on November 5, 2002, and approved it by a margin of 67%–33%. Lawsuit On April 10, 2012, Lambda Legal, an LGBT rights advocacy organization, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada on behalf of eight same-sex couples. Four of the couples had been denied marriage licenses by county clerks in Nevada. The other four had married in other jurisdictions (California and Canada) and wanted Nevada to recognize their relationships as marriages. The suit named as defendants Gov. Brian Sandoval and three county clerks. Lambda Attorney Tara Borelli explained the plaintiffs' argument: \\"[W]e are relying on the Nevada domestic partnership law to help illustrate how irrational the unequal treatment of same-sex couples is, because there are a number of rationales they have articulated for this kind of discrimination that really are not credible in Nevada. For example, it is often argued in these cases that there is an interest relating to children and parenting. But in Nevada, separate and apart from the constitutional amendment, the state treats same-sex couple equally as parents in other respects. And so that can't be what the marriage amendment is about, because it has no effect on parenting.\\" The plaintiffs argued that Nevada's contrast of marriage and domestic partnership, which it called a \\"second-class status\\", distinguished their case from Minnesota's lack of any provision for same-sex couples in 1972, when the Supreme Court in Baker v. Nelson refused to hear a challenge to Minnesota's restrictive marriage definition \\"for want of a substantial federal question.\\"Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, September 10, 2012 As part of their equal protection claim, the plaintiffs argued that the court should evaluate distinctions based on sexual orientation using the heightened scrutiny standard. They did not assert a fundamental right to marry nor a due process claim, but focused on the equal protection claim and Nevada's disparate treatment of same-sex couples, being \\"so convinced that our equal protection claim is correct that we wanted to keep the focus of the case there.... And courts often like to decide questions no more broadly than they need to, to resolve a case. A Nevada reporter noted that both Republican Gov. Sandoval, the principal defendant in the suit, and Democratic Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, who was representing him, tended to avoid public controversy and \\"both ... refused to fully engage in the political debate. They're framing their roles as technocrats doing an administrative job rather than politicians or ideologues wading into an emotional issue.\\" Judge Robert Jones, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court of Nevada, held an initial hearing on August 10, 2012. The parties had agreed in advance on how they wanted the court to handle motions in the case. The plaintiffs agreed not to oppose the request by the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, the original backers of the constitutional amendment and now based in Boise, Idaho, to intervene as a defendant. The defendants agreed that the court should postpone consideration of its arguments for summary dismissal until the case was fully briefed. Both sides asked the court to allow them to present expert testimony. Jones did not rule out expert testimony but expressed strong reservations, that it would require him to act \\"as a legislature\\". He said: \\"This area you're talking about ... is so broad it's across the entire United States. You're asking them to summarize thousands of incidences.\\" Noting that several related cases were nearing possible consideration by the Supreme Court, he agreed the case should be expedited: \\"It makes sense to get this decided and off with the circus train.\\" He thought Sevcik would make a good complement to the Ninth Circuit's decision in Perry v. Brown. Jones scheduled oral argument for November 26 on all issues in the case, but on September 19 he canceled the oral argument and announced he would rule on the basis of the briefs alone. District court decision On November 29, Jones ruled against the plaintiffs. He held that \\"the present challenge is in the main a garden-variety equal protection challenge precluded by Baker.... The equal protection claim is the same in this case as it was in Baker, i.e., whether the Equal Protection Clause prevents a state from refusing to permit same-sex marriages.\\" Jones also analyzed the plaintiffs' other arguments \\"so that the Court of Appeals need not remand for further proceedings should it rule that Baker does not control...\\" He identified the discrimination Nevada makes between marriages the state does and does not recognize as a distinction based not on gender, which would require him to use intermediate scrutiny, but on sexual orientation, stating that the state maintains \\"heterosexual superiority ... by relegating (mainly) homosexual legal unions to a lesser status\\". He found that only the rational basis standard applies to distinctions based on sexual orientation, relying on High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (1990). He explained his agreement with that case's determination that \\"homosexuals are not a suspect or quasi-suspect class\\" requiring a higher standard of review because \\"where no lingering effects of past discrimination are inherited, it is contemporary disadvantages that matter for the purpose of assessing disabilities due to discrimination. Any such disabilities with respect to homosexuals have been largely erased since 1990.\\" He also argued that homosexuals have gained significant political power, citing the rarity of anti-homosexual messages in the national media and attributing the president's acceptance of same-sex marriage to \\"the homosexual-rights lobby\\". He disputed the Second Circuit's finding in Windsor v. United States (2012) that homosexuals are a politically powerless class: \\"The question of 'powerlessness' under an equal protection analysis requires that the group's chances of democratic success be virtually hopeless, not simply that its path to success is difficult or challenging because of democratic forces.\\" He states that no action should be taken on unclear Constitutional rules, such as \\"equal protection of the laws\\", which is a vague clause of the Constitution whose enforcement is \\"a usurpation of democratic governance via judicial whim—a judicial practice much in vogue today\\". Having determined that there is no clear Constitutional prohibition, he cited a concurring opinion in Frontiero v. Richardson that the Supreme Court should not decide sensitive issues at the very time they are under consideration. Finally, applying rational basis review, Jones found that \\"[t]he protection of the traditional institution of marriage ... is a legitimate state interest\\" and quoted Lawrence v. Texas, stating that the prevention of \\"abuse of an institution the law protects\\" is a valid state interest. He found that the state may rely on speculation alone for its rational basis, citing Heller v. Doe. If marriage is extended to same-sex couples, he wrote, \\"it is conceivable that a meaningful percentage of heterosexual persons would cease to value the civil institution as highly as they previously had ... leading to an increased percentage of out-of-wedlock children, single-parent families, ... or other unforeseen consequences.\\" He stated that Nevada has not decreased same-sex couples' rights (having no right to marry to begin with) and that their exclusion from marriage but not from a separate-but-parallel institution can only be seen as \\"benevolence\\". He also addressed issues not raised by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs had referenced Romer v. Evans (1996) only to note that the Supreme Court in that case had found it unnecessary to consider more than rational basis review.\\"Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled that sexual orientation classifications are suspect, that is because the Supreme Court has not yet found it necessary to resolve the question. Romer v. Evans ... did not decide the issue, finding it unnecessary to look beyond rational basis review both because the state's attempt to strip gay people of all antidiscrimination protections was a 'denial of equal protection of the laws in the most literal sense,' and because the state's action 'confound[ed]' and 'defie[d]' rational basis review.\\" Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgement, September 10, 2012 Jones discussed Romer at length to show how it did not apply to Nevada's marriage restriction, since Romer addressed, he wrote, \\"an extreme case concerning a novel and ambitious type of law ... prevalent only under totalitarian regimes.\\" Nevada's definition of marriage by contrast was \\"not based purely upon anti-homosexual animus, as the constitutional provision in Romer was.\\" Appeal Attorneys for the plaintiffs filed an appeal on December 3, 2012 with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.Sevcik v. Sandoval, Plaintiffs' Notice of Appeal, December 3, 2012, accessed December 4, 2012 The Court originally planned to hear the case on a parallel track with a similar Hawaii same-sex marriage case, Jackson v. Abercrombie, until Hawaii's legalization of same-sex marriage as of December 2, 2013, mooted that case. The Court placed the case on hold pending the Supreme Court rulings in Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor on June 26, 2013. The Coalition for the Protection of Marriage on December 5, 2012, filed a petition for certiorari before judgment with the Supreme Court, asking that court to take up the case without waiting for action by the Court of Appeals.Petition for a Writ of Certiorari before Judgment, December 5, 2012 The Supreme Court denied that petition on June 27, 2013.Supreme Court of the United States: Order List 570 U.S., June 27, 2013, accessed June 27, 2013 On October 18, 2013, Lambda Legal filed its opening brief.Sevcik v. Sandoval, Plaintiffs- Appellant's Opening Brief, October 18, 2013, accessed October 19, 2013 On January 21, 2014, the state of Nevada submitted its reply brief.Appellee Governor Sandoval's answering brief in Sevcik v. Sandoval On January 24, Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto announced she was reviewing the state's brief because the Ninth Circuit's decision in SmithKline Beecham Corporation v. Abbott Laboratories on January 21 established that laws that make a distinction based on sexual orientation are subject to \\"heightened scrutiny\\", making the arguments that state had made based on the less demanding \\"rational basis\\" standard \\"likely no longer tenable in the Ninth Circuit.\\" On February 10, Masto withdrew the state's brief defending Nevada's ban on same-sex marriage. Governor Sandoval agreed: \\"It has become clear that this case is no longer defensible in court\\". On February 12, 2014, the Ninth Circuit issued an order vacating the previous order scheduling the Sevcik and Jackson cases together. The Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on September 8 before Judges Stephen Reinhardt, Ronald M. Gould, and Marsha S. Berzon in Sevcik, Jackson, and a third case. It overturned the district court's ruling on October 7, finding Nevada's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples unconstitutional. On October 7, 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the federal district court in Nevada and remanded it back to the district court, ordering it to immediately issue an injunction to bar enforcement of the Nevada same-sex marriage ban amendment. It immediately made its holdings final and issued its mandate. On October 8, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, apparently by mistake, ordered the Ninth Circuit's mandate temporarily stayed as part of his response to a request from Idaho officials in a related case. He amended his order to exempt this case from that stay. The same day, the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage asked the U.S. Supreme Court to suspend implementation of its ruling, referencing the arguments made by Idaho state officials in Sevcik. It withdrew that request the next day and then renewed it on October 13. District court remand On remand, the plaintiffs submitted a motion asking the district court for an injunction preventing the state from enforcing its same-sex marriage ban and providing the court with its suggested language. Judge Jones recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge James Mahan. On October 9, Judge Mahan issued the injunction and same-sex couples began obtaining marriage licenses. Petition for rehearing The Coalition to Protect Marriage asked the Ninth Circuit to rehear the case en banc. Among other arguments, it presented a statistical analysis that called into question the randomness of the Circuit's method of assigning judges to cases. Attorneys for the same-sex couples, while contending that the method of judge selection could not be grounds for rehearing the case, disputed the Coalition's statistical methodology. After at least one circuit judge called for a vote on the petition for rehearing Sevcik (along with Latta v. Otter) en banc, a majority of active duty judges—as required by Ninth Circuit rules—would not agree to the petition; therefore such petition was denied as of January 9, 2015. Circuit Judge O’Scannlain, joined by fellow judges Rawlinson and Bea, filed a written dissent of the denial.

It was in Mount Calvary Baptist Church where Parrish’s family first discovered his musical potential. During a choir rehearsal one night (in which his mother was directing), Parrish demonstrated his ability to play by ear for the first time at the age of six by walking over to a nearby piano and playing one of the songs the choir was singing. \\"I thought everyone could play songs as they heard it, I didn't realize it was a gift,\\" Parrish says. Parrish studied classical piano for twelve years, starting at age six. He would later become the official music director and Hammond organist for the church at age nine. =2010-12: Relate= Spencer Parrish's first studio album, Relate, was released on July 29, 2012 under Island Def Jam Digital Distribution. The first single, \\"Persistence\\", became available for digital download on February 18, 2012. The album's lead single, \\"We Can Relate\\", became available for digital download on May 31, 2012. Production for the album took place at Parrish’s home over the course of a year; then-14-year-old Parrish is attributed with producing and writing the entire album, focused mainly on his social life. =2012-present: High School and College= Parrish attended local high school Rome Free Academy for four years, graduating in 2016 as the salutatorian of his class.

The amount can be estimated by presuming that the portion of the jar that cannot be seen contains an amount equivalent to the amount contained in the same volume for the portion that can be seen. Estimation (or estimating) is the process of finding an estimate, or approximation, which is a value that is usable for some purpose even if input data may be incomplete, uncertain, or unstable. The value is nonetheless usable because it is derived from the best information available.C. Lon Enloe, Elizabeth Garnett, Jonathan Miles, Physical Science: What the Technology Professional Needs to Know (2000), p. 47. Typically, estimation involves \\"using the value of a statistic derived from a sample to estimate the value of a corresponding population parameter\\".Raymond A. Kent, \\"Estimation\\", Data Construction and Data Analysis for Survey Research (2001), p. 157. The sample provides information that can be projected, through various formal or informal processes, to determine a range most likely to describe the missing information. An estimate that turns out to be incorrect will be an overestimate if the estimate exceeded the actual result,James Tate, John Schoonbeck, Reviewing Mathematics (2003), page 27: \\"An overestimate is an estimate you know is greater than the exact answer\\". and an underestimate if the estimate fell short of the actual result.James Tate, John Schoonbeck, Reviewing Mathematics (2003), page 27: \\"An underestimate is an estimate you know is less than the exact answer\\". (Contrast with prediction.)  How estimation is done  Estimation is often done by sampling, which is counting a small number of examples something, and projecting that number onto a larger population. An example of estimation would be determining how many candies of a given size are in a glass jar. Because the distribution of candies inside the jar may vary, the observer can count the number of candies visible through the glass, consider the size of the jar, and presume that a similar distribution can be found in the parts that can not be seen, thereby making an estimate of the total number of candies that could be in the jar if that presumption were true. Estimates can similarly be generated by projecting results from polls or surveys onto the entire population. In making an estimate, the goal is often most useful to generate a range of possible outcomes that is precise enough to be useful, but not so precise that it is likely to be inaccurate. For example, in trying to guess the number of candies in the jar, if fifty were visible, and the total volume of the jar seemed to be about twenty times as large as the volume containing the visible candies, then one might simply project that there were a thousand candies in the jar. Such a projection, intended to pick the single value that is believed to be closest to the actual value, is called a point estimate. However, a point estimation is likely to be incorrect, because the sample size—in this case, the number of candies that are visible—is too small a number to be sure that it does not contain anomalies that differ from the population as a whole. A corresponding concept is an interval estimate, which captures a much larger range of possibilities, but is too broad to be useful. For example, if one were asked to estimate the percentage of people who like candy, it would clearly be correct that the number falls between zero and one hundred percent. Such an estimate would provide no guidance, however, to somebody who is trying to determine how many candies to buy for a party to be attended by a hundred people.  Uses of estimation  In mathematics, approximation describes the process of finding estimates in the form of upper or lower bounds for a quantity that cannot readily be evaluated precisely, and approximation theory deals with finding simpler functions that are close to some complicated function and that can provide useful estimates. In statistics, an estimator is the formal name for the rule by which an estimate is calculated from data, and estimation theory deals with finding estimates with good properties. This process is used in signal processing, for approximating an unobserved signal on the basis of an observed signal containing noise. For estimation of yet-to- be observed quantities, forecasting and prediction are applied. A Fermi problem, in physics, is one concerning estimation in problems which typically involve making justified guesses about quantities that seem impossible to compute given limited available information. Estimation is important in business and economics, because too many variables exist to figure out how large-scale activities will develop. Estimation in project planning can be particularly significant, because plans for the distribution of labor and for purchases of raw materials must be made, despite the inability to know every possible problem that may come up. A certain amount of resources will be available for carrying out a particular project, making it important to obtain or generate a cost estimate as one of the vital elements of entering into the project.A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) Third Edition, An American National Standard, ANSI/PMI 99-001-2004, Project Management Institute, Inc, 2004, . The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines a cost estimate as, \\"the summation of individual cost elements, using established methods and valid data, to estimate the future costs of a program, based on what is known today\\", and reports that \\"realistic cost estimating was imperative when making wise decisions in acquiring new systems\\".GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP, United States Government Accountabity Office, March 2009, Preface p. i. Furthermore, project plans must not underestimate the needs of the project, which can result in delays while unmet needs are fulfilled, nor must they greatly overestimate the needs of the project, or else the unneeded resources may go to waste. An informal estimate when little information is available is called a guesstimate, because the inquiry becomes closer to purely guessing the answer. The \\"estimated\\" sign, ℮, is used to designate that package contents are close to the nominal contents.

Metal fatigue in a compressor-disc had caused the casing to burst, cutting fuel lines and starting an engine fire, which sent the aircraft out of control. The crash Flight 171 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Bombay (Mumbai) to Madras (Chennai). A Boeing aircraft was originally supposed to make the flight but it developed engine trouble and was replaced with a Sud Aviation Caravelle.Jet crash kills 95 in Bombay Shortly after takeoff from runway 27, Flight 171 suffered a No. 2 engine failure. The crew of Flight 171 immediately turned back to attempt an emergency landing on Bombay Airport's runway 09. With its undercarriage down approximately 1000 yards from the end of the runway and while at an altitude of 300 feet, the aircraft suffered a loss of control and plummeted into the ground. Everyone on board Flight 171 perished in the accident. Cause A fatigue crack in the tenth stage compressor disc caused a power plant failure which was followed by the bursting of the compressor casing and the cutting of fuel lines that spanned the structure. This caused an intense in-flight fire in the engine bay. It is believed the fire consumed the Caravelle's supply of hydraulic fluid and this was the cause of the aircraft going out of control.

Amongst women, large hair-dos, puffed-up styles, permanent waves, and softer cuts typified the decade. Big hair that was \\"often permed to achieve the desired volume\\" is especially associated with women of the mid 1980s as well as male rockstars of that era, especially of the glam metal genre. Television shows such as Dynasty helped popularize the high volume bouffant and glamorous image associated with it. Categories =Cuts= Liberty spikes (left) and crimson Mohawk (right) Totally shaved heads gained popularity among men. The sideburns of the 1960s and 1970s saw a massive decline in fashion in late 1970s. Big and eccentric hair styles were popularized by film and music stars, in particular amongst teenagers. Although straight hair was the norm at the beginning of the decade, as many late 1970s styles were still relevant, by around 1982 the perm had come into fashion. This was in large part due to many movies released at the time, as well as possibly being a rebellious movement against the 1970s. In 1984, sideburns made a comeback but were slightly thinner and shorter, and better groomed than those of the 1970s, lasting until the end of 1986. These sideburns were usually (but not always) used as an add-on to the Mullet haircut. Spiked hair, teased hair, brightly colored hair, and shaved hair sections were popularized in the 1980s by the punk movement, as were the Mohawk and its twisted variant, Liberty spikes. The Mullet haircut existed in several different styles, all characterized by hair short on the sides and long in the back. Mullets were popular in suburban and rural areas among working class men. This contrasted with a conservative look favored by business professionals, with neatly groomed short hair and very short sideburns for men and sleekly straight hair for women. White collar men's haircuts were often shaved at the nape of the neck to create an artificially even hairline. Women's hairstyles became increasingly long in the latter part of the decade and blunt cuts dominated. Blunt cuts of the late 1980s brought long hair to an equal length across the back. Bangs were popular, with \\"mall bangs\\", attributed to teenage girls who frequented shopping malls, were styled by ratting bangs into peaks or mounds, and then using hairspray to keep them in place. =Chemical treatments= Michael Jackson with Jheri curl in 1988 Many young women in Europe and North America dyed their hair a rich burgundy or plum-red in the last half of the decade. Auburns and reds were favored by those who aspired to emulate Molly Ringwald. But non-traditional haircolors, such as bright blue, crimson, green, and shocking pink gained favor from the punk subculture. Chemical hair treatment was popularized by the perm hairstyle, which resulted in soft, full curls. By the late 1980s, the permed bouffant had become highly fashionable among women of all walks of life, notably Princess Diana. The long, permed hair look was particularly popular amongst male rock stars of this period, associated with heavy metal and glam metal bands of this era such as Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, and Whitesnake. =Styling techniques= During the middle and late 1980s it was unfashionable to part either men's or women's hair as the perm made the center parting look unattractive. Mousse was used in styling an individual's hair to attain a desired shiny look and greater volume; some mousse even contained glitter. Hairsprays such as Aqua Net were also used in quantity. Artificial dreadlock extensions were inspired by the Rastafari movement. Michael Jackson wore his hair in Jheri curl style in the 1980s; it was popular among African Americans in the early decade, but its popularity waned by the end of the decade, with the hi-top fade partly replacing it. Hair gel was used by young men to effect the preppy look of a well groomed, short hair style. Crimped hair was as fashionable as the large wave. Accessories Scrunchies hair bands Scrunchies and headbands made of elastic and cloth were popular in all different colors, styles, and patterns. Scrunchies were very popular in the side ponytail hair style. \\"Banana clips\\" were another favorite, pulling hair back into a fanned out style. Other accessories include barettes and bows. Sweatbands were also major, usually worn with sweatband on the wrist and legwarmers on the legs. Facial The trend in moustaches and full beards carried over from the late-1970s and into the early-1980s but waned as the decade progressed. From the mid to late-1980s, clean-shaven faces with short or no sideburns was the norm. However, the success of Miami Vice did spark a trend in the facial hair style called designer stubble.

It was also used for other sports. History =Rugby league= The first owners of the Canal Street ground were Runcorn RFC, a rugby union club formed sometime before 1886. In 1895 the club were one of the founders of the Northern Union, which later became the Rugby League. The club suffered badly during World War I and failed to return to the league after hostilities ended. =Football= At this point the ground was purchased by a R H Posnett, the owner of a local tannery company and was used by the Highfield and Camden Tanneries Recreation Club, who became known as Runcorn FC from 1918). The club continued to be run under the overall control of the tanneries until the football club became a limited company in 1953. =Rugby league returns in ground share= Huyton Rugby League Club moved to Canal Street under a ground sharing agreement with the football club from 1984–85 to 1989–90, changing their name to Runcorn Highfield RLFC. =Tragedy= The football club had mixed success on the field, but in later years had problems with the ground, which by the 1990s was in need of major works. Disaster struck three times off the field during the 1993–94 season. A first round FA Cup tie against Hull City, attracted a larger crowd than expected. The away supporters gathered in a central position and although the ground attendants tried to split them they resisted. The result was that in order to get a better view of a goalmouth incident and Hull's first goal the crowd surged forward and the perimeter wall collapsed. Forty to fifty spectators were trapped and four spectators and a police constable were injured. The match was abandoned and replayed the following week at another local ground. Later in the season, the roof blew off a stand in high winds, and the main stand was gutted by fire. With the club's precarious financial position, and the cost of rebuilding their Canal Street home, Runcorn suffered on the pitch, resulting in relegation, which was to be the start of a downhill spiral. =Closure= The last competitive game to be played at Canal Street was on 5 May 2001 and resulted in a defeat 2–1 by Gateshead. Runcorn player Liam Watson scored the club's final goal in this match. At the end of the 2000–01 season, the football club, struggling with large debts and dwindling attendances, sold the ground and moved to Halton Stadium, home of Widnes Vikings Rugby League Club, where they stayed for several years before again struggling financially and ground sharing with Southport at Haig Avenue and Prescot Cables at Valerie Park, before finally folding at the end of the 2005–06 season. The ground itself, by now in a dilapidated and a dangerous condition, was sold to developers and is now a housing development, the Linnets Park housing estate  Note  A brief scribbled note on an old programme mentions the name \\"Pavillions\\" as being the home of Runcorn RFC. This error is repeated in several books and websites. This ground is not related to Runcorn RFC or Canal Street. It is in fact a recreation area on which sports are played and was used by Runcorn ARLFC, a junior team from the early 2000s, and who moved there from the start of the 2009-10 summer season (their 5th in the Summer Conference). It is on the Eastern end of Sandy Lane (between Western Point Expressway and Picow Farm Road), Runcorn. Prior to that Runcorn ARLFC had played at various grounds including at Moore, and moved to Pavilions from the fields to the rear of The Heath School, off Clifton Road, where they had played the previous season (2008–09).

Huwali هولي) also collectively referred to as Bani Huwala, is a blanket term usually used to refer to migrant Arabs who migrated from the Arabian peninsula around the 18th or 19th century to the area which is now the Hormozgan Province and Fars Province, mainly Bandar Abbas, Qishm and the mainland near Bandar Lengeh.Studia Iranica - Volumes 1-2 و P. Geuthner, 1972 Page 80Waqai-I Manazil-I Rum; Tipu Sultan's Mission to Constantinople – January 1, 2005 by Mohibbul Hasan, p20 Although the term generally refers to the Persanized Arabs who remigrated back to the Arabian peninsula, the term may also be used to refer to both Persanized Arabs or Arabized Persians who both lived on the Iranian coast of the Persian Gulf due to the intermarriage between Arabs and Persians. The imposition of restrictive economic policies by Reza Shah in the 1930s led to the migration of most of the Huwala back to the Arabian peninsula. Most of the Huwala Arabs settled in Iran for a period of time and intermarried with the indigenous Achomi and have adopted their language, hence they are sometimes called Ajam by the peninsular Arabs. The Huwala follows Sunni Islam, particularly the Shafi'i school, as opposed the majority Persian Shia and the Hanbali or Maliki peninsular Arabs. Most of the Huwala have remigrated back to the Arabian peninsula between 1850-1900s.  Etymology  Al Bastakiya was built by the Huwala who remigrated back to Dubai and introduced the design of Windcatchers. Huwala (Arabic: هوله), is a plural Arabic term for Huwali (Arabic: هولي), which is a word derived from the Arabic verb Huwwal (Arabic: حوّل) which means \\"to change over\\". A book by Dejanirah Couto and Rui Loureiro into Portuguese interactions in Hormuz defines Huwala as \\"migrant Arabs\\".Revisiting Hormuz: Portuguese Interactions in the Persian Gulf Region in the ... edited by Dejanirah Couto, Rui Loureiro p.93 Author Lawrence G. Potter defines Huwala as  History  In the 18th century, the Arab Al Qasimi tribal affiliation, once a major maritime power, took control of southern Iranian coasts and islands around Bandar Lengeh. In 1779 the Iranian Zand dynasty acknowledged a fait accompli and recognized a Qasimi as local ruler (farmandar) of Bandar Lengeh. At about the same time the Zands allowed the British East India Company to establish its residency and presence in Bushehr. The Qasimis remained in control of Bandar Lengeh and surrounding region until 1887, when they were defeated by the British in their self proclaimed “anti-piracy” campaign which Emirati based scholars (including current Sharjah ruler Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi today argue that it was a myth used to dominate trade routes to India and Iraq). The Qasimis retreated to the southern coast of the Gulf, and their Iranian domains reverted to nominal rule by Tehran. The Achomi (Larestani) Iranian population lived on the coast alongside the Qasimis. They prospered under Al Qasimi rule as merchants in pearl trading. Author John W. Limbert argues that in response to Reza Shah Pahlavi's policies of centralization, conscription, civil status reforms, and, most important, the forced unveiling of women led to many of the Achomi's to follow the Qasimis back to the Arabian Peninsula, further mixing the Huwala's Arabic and Persian roots.  Culture  The re-migration of the Arabs and some Persians to the Arabian Peninsula led to the transfer of the technology of windcatchers. Windcatchers (called Baadgir in Persian and Barjil in Arabic) is an ancient air-conditioning system that cools the airs inside living quarters in the hot and dry climate of the Iranian plateau and the Arabian peninsula. The Bastakis established Bastakiya in Dubai mirroring their original hometown of Bastak in southern Iran. The windcatcher designs today decorates many areas in Eastern Arabia such as Awadhiya in Bahrain (established by Huwala who named the region Awadhiya in honor of their hometown Awadh - now known as Evaz), Bastakiya in Dubai, and Souq Waqif in Doha by the Lari's. The Huwala established the many iconic Eastern Arabian cultural buildings seen including Qasr al-Hosn in Abu Dhabi which was designed by Mohammed al Bastaki.http://www.alkhaleej.ae/supplements/page/3909fd12-d740-4dc4-81d7-a15081b5ffb0 Alongside the Qassimi maritime power, the Huwala windcatchers and Baghlah which formed the maritime unit of the Qassimi today formulated the majority of Eastern Arabian culture icons. Mahyawa, a tangy Iranian cuisine fish sauce was also introduced by the Huwala to the Arabian peninsula and many associate the sauce with the Huwala.  Identity and origin  The Huwala and the Achomi (also called Larestani) share very similarities that have led scholars to even consider them sometimes as the same population. Both are Sunni Muslims and both may refer to themselves as Khodemooni, a colloquial Larestani word that means “among ourselves”, “casual”, “insider”, or just “us” which was used to differentiate them from the majority Persian Shia. The Achomi's language is a southern Iranian language with dialects such as Gerashi and Bastaki. Achomi is an endangered language as its usage has declined tremendously as most young people speak either Arabic or Persian. Both the Huwala and the Achomi lived in the subtropical region of southern Iran. This area was largely neglected by the central Iranian government as most of its inhabitants were nomads or Arabs.

Patt's tuning simplified the learning of the fretboard and chords by beginners and improvisation by advanced guitarists. He invented major-thirds tuning under the inspiration of first the atonal music of Arnold Schoenberg and second the jazz of John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman. He graduated with a degree in geology from the University of Pittsburgh. After his career as a guitarist, he worked as a geologist and as a hydrologist, often consulting on projects related to the U.S. Department of Energy. Biography Chords are inverted by shifting notes three strings on the same fret. Patt was born in Kittanning, Pennsylvania on 5 December 1929 and studied geology at the University of Pittsburgh. =Guitar and music theory= While in Pittsburgh, Patt studied guitar under Joe Negri.Joe Negri and Patt collaborated in 1989 on this recording: * By then, Negri was already nationally known as the guitarist on the PBS children's television-show Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, on which he also appeared as \\"Handyman Negri\\". * Patt played rhythm guitar in the style of Freddie Green, who played a Stromberg in the Count Basie Orchestra. Having earned his baccalaureate degree, he joined the United States Army and played guitar in an Army band. Following his 1955 discharge from the Army, Patt played with touring bands, for example, Neal Hefti, Frankie Carle, Les Elgart, Benny Goodman, Richard Maltby, and The Glenn Miller Orchestra. After touring for five years, Patt settled in New York City, where he worked as musician both at ABC and on Broadway from 1960 to 1970; during this period he regarded Barry Galbraith as his mentor. He studied under George Russell, whose (1959) Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization Patt edited.\\"My grateful acknowledgement to ... Ralph Patt for his valuable assistance in the preparation of the manuscript\\", wrote . Patt recorded \\"For George Russell\\" in 2002: * Patt also studied with Gunther Schuller, who himself was a student of Arnold Schoenberg and who used Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique for atonal composition. Patt wanted to be able to play and then to improvise twelve-tone music. Major-thirds tuning Patt was inspired by the jazz of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane and the atonal music of Schoenberg. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation, he introduced major-thirds tuning by 1964, perhaps in 1963. Patt's tuning is a regular tuning in the sense that all of the intervals between its successive open strings are major thirds; in contrast, the standard guitar-tuning has one major-third amid four fourths. Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of his work as a session musician after 1965 in New York. Major-thirds tuning packs the chromatic scale (the consecutive twelve-notes of the octave) onto four consecutive frets of three consecutive strings, an arrangement that reduces the extensions of the little and index fingers (\\"hand stretching\\"). Major and minor chords are played on two successive frets, and so require only two fingers; other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on three successive frets. For each regular tuning, chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and that simplifies advanced players' improvisation. In contrast, chords cannot be shifted around the fretboard in the standard tuning E-A-D-G-B-E, which requires four chord-shapes for the major chords; standard tuning has separate chord-forms for chords having their root note on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings. Having exactly three pitch classes for its open notes (for example {C,E,G}), each major-thirds tuning repeats every note in a higher octave, because guitars have six strings. Being regular, M3 tunings repeat each note after two strings: this repetition simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation. Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. =Guitars with seven and eight strings= Saul Koll built this eight-string guitar for Ralph Patt to play in major thirds. Major-thirds tuning has a smaller scope than standard guitar-tuning, and so Patt started using seven-string guitars, which enabled major-thirds tuning to have the E-e' range of the standard tuning. He first experimented with a wide-neck Mango guitar from the 1920s, which he modified to have seven strings in 1963. In 1967 he purchased a seven-string by José Rubio. Patt used major-thirds tuning when he performed as a session musician in New York City after 1965. Later, he purchased six-string archtop hollow- body guitars that were then modified by luthiers to have wider necks, wider pickups, and eight strings. Patt's Gibson ES-150 was modified by Vincent \\"Jimmy\\" DiSerio, a luthier who worked in the firm of John D'Angelico, circa 1965. Luthier Saul Koll modified a sequence of guitars: a 1938 Gibson Cromwell, a Sears Silvertone, a circa 1922 Mango archtop, a 1951 Gibson L-50, and a 1932 Epiphone Broadway; for Koll's modifications, custom pick-ups accommodated Patt's wide necks and high G (equivalently A); custom pick-ups were manufactured by Seymour Duncan and by Bill Lawrence. Besides these guitars, Patt regularly played other stringed instruments as a recording musician: classical guitar, 12-string guitar, 6-string bass guitar, mandolin, banjo, and oud. Patt stated that \\"the only guys that didn't have to double on dates were the Tony Mottolas and the Johnny Smiths\\"; Tony Mottola and Johnny Smith were famous jazz-guitarists, and \\"doubling\\" refers to a musician's switching from one instrument to another, particularly within a family of instruments.: Patt worked primarily as a studio musician from 1970 to 1975. Scholarship Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major-thirds tuning. This webpage was part of a website with extensive information for jazz guitarists. Patt's website published his Vanilla book, which contains the chord progressions for four-hundred jazz standards, from \\"After you've gone\\" to \\"Zing! went the strings\\". Its title refers to \\"Just play the vanilla changes\\", advice to young pianists from Lester Young. It was updated in 2008. His website followed earlier contributions to guitar scholarship and instruction. In 1962, Patt wrote his Guitar chord dictionary (1962). Living in New York City in the 1960s, he studied with Chuck Wayne, with whom he wrote The guitar appreggio dictionary (1965), one of the bestselling titles from the music-publishing firm of Henry Adler. =Return to geology= As a studio musician in the 1970s, Patt had to play less jazz and more rock and roll, and so he changed careers. He returned to geology while continuing to pursue jazz as an avocation. Around 1975 he began working on his doctoral degree in hydrogeology. Employed by the US Department of Energy, he specialized in ground-water contamination from nuclear waste; as a research hydrogeologist, he accepted assignments worldwide and had extensive travels in Ukraine and Russia. He was employed by Oregon's Department of Water Resources, where he served as its expert on the risks to the Columbia River from the Hanford Site. As a hydrological geologist (hydrologist), he was appointed to a panel of outside experts that reviewed and then \\"slammed\\" the U.S. Department of Energy's report on the safety of the underground storage of high-level nuclear waste at Hanford. =Death= In 2002 and 2010, Patt's hometown was listed as Canby, Oregon, near Portland. Having been diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2007, Ralph Oliver Patt died at the age of 80 on 6 October 2010 in Canby at home. To honor his memory, the Ralph Patt Memorial Scholarship provided full tuition, room, and board for a college student to attend the Mel Brown Jazz Camp in 2011.

Retrieved on February 6, 2018.) was an American recording engineer, record producer and musician. He was best known for his engineering techniques with both analogue and digital audio recordings with prominent popular pop and rock records in American music from the late 1960s to the present. In addition to his recording expertise, Robinson was also an accomplished musician in his own right and had been awarded gold records as both a saxophonist and bass guitarist. Early life Jimmy Robinson (front, far right) with The Revolution Jimmy Robinson was born July 29, 1950 in Washington D.C. to James K. Robinson I and Louise H. Robinson and spent his early childhood growing up in College Park, Maryland. At an early age Robinson took a strong interest in music and electronics while attending schools in the Washington metropolitan area and began playing saxophone at age of 12 with various bands before joining in the band \\"The Nowhere Men\\" at the age of 18 in 1968. Engineering and producing (Left to Right) Jimmy Robinson & Gary Kellgren in the \\"Pit\\", Sly Stone's Studio designed by Gary Kellgren in Sausalito, California in 1975. Photo by :Herbie Worthington =The Record Plant NYC= In 1969, The Nowhere Men were playing a show at The Cellar Door in DC's Georgetown district when Robinson met former Electric Flag drummer Buddy Miles. Buddy took a liking to Robinson's sax playing and invited him up to New York City to work a few gigs and meet Gary Kellgren, and subsequently Jimi Hendrix, at the Record Plant recording studios in New York City. Gary Kellgren immediately was impressed with Robinson's technical ability and asked him to begin working as an assistant engineer at the Record Plant NYC. At his first session there in 1969, he worked with engineer Jack Adams and R&B; singer Patti Labelle. During his tenure working at the Record Plant, Robinson developed a close working relationship with Hendrix whom he would drive home and hang out with after sessions. Hendrix preferred to work at night and since Gary Kellgren and fellow engineer Eddie Kramer preferred to record during the day, Robinson soon became one of Hendrix's regular recording engineers for late night sessions. =Band of Gypsys= Upon hearing that Capitol Records was looking for Hendrix to fulfill a contract he had signed with Ed Chaplin of PPX Enterprises before he had put together the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Hendrix decided to form a band with Buddy Miles and long-time friend and bass player Billy Cox. The name \\"Band of Gypsys\\" was already mentioned as an alternative name for his band by Hendrix in his speeches during the Woodstock concert. Capitol Records sent out Wally Heider to record the live debut of the Band of Gypsys and Gary Kellgren sent Robinson as the Record Plant's preferred engineer. The first live show was to be performed at the Fillmore East on New Year's Eve 1969 with the Voices of East Harlem as the opening act. The Band of Gypsys' performances were recorded two nights in a row with two shows each night. After the shows, the recordings were sent over to Juggy Sound Studios (owned by producer Juggy Murray) where the album was to be mixed by Eddie Kramer. For a few days the tapes went missing, but were soon found, mixed by Kramer, and then delivered to Capitol Records. The Band of Gypsys Live at the Fillmore East went up the charts quickly to #4 in the US and #5 in the U.K. and was RIAA certified gold that same year. This was a first for a live recording. Initially, it was unclear if it was going to be a commercial success. However, shortly after its release it was hailed by critics as the standard for which all artists should strive in live recordings. The recording was Jimmy Robinson's first gold record for recording. Robinson's recording of \\"Machine Gun\\" (Capitol Records STAO-472 -US) on Band of Gypsys is considered by most Hendrix aficionados to be the best live solo recording of Hendrix. Loose Ends, the fourth and last studio album released by Hendrix which Robinson engineered and overdubbed, was released by manager Michael Jeffery. Unfortunately, Warner Bros. Records decided not to release the album in the US & Canada because of content. It was released in the UK, France and Japan. =Electric Lady Studios= Under the advice of Eddie Kramer and manager Michael Jefferies, Hendrix decided to construct his own recording studio, Electric Lady. After construction was completed, Kramer and Andy Edlen invited Robinson to work there in the summer of 1970. During his tenure working at Electric Lady, Robinson began working on a few tracks for Stevie Wonder's Talking Book and Innervisions. Robinson also worked with several prominent artists of the time including Roberta Flack, Led Zeppelin (on Houses of the Holy), Blood Sweat and Tears, and Miles Davis' Live Evil. In August 1972, jazz vibraphonist Michael Manieri asked Robinson to be his assistant and join GNU Music. Robinson worked for Manieri until the end of the year. =Larabee Sound Los Angeles= In January 1973 Bob Margoulieff and Malcolm Cecil invited Jimmy out to Los Angeles to work on a few projects, and Robinson decided it was time to leave NYC. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Robinson quickly found himself as the lead candidate to be Chief Engineer of Larrabee Sound on Bob Margoulieff and Malcolm Cecil's recommendation. In February 1973 Robinson was invited to join Larabee Sound as Chief Engineer under the supervision of Jackie Mills. The first slate of recording projects included Cher, Al Wilson, Robbie Krieger, John Densmore from The Doors, Chris DeMarco, and Rachel Perry. As Jimmy was working at Larabee his fondness for technology and instrument construction led him to begin working with Paul Beaver as part of the synthesizer team Beaver and Krouse on a suggestion from Walter Sear; he began developing a polyphonic synthesizer with Paul Beaver that unfortunately never came to fruition due to Beaver's untimely death in 1974. Robinson married Maggie Welch, sister of Bob Welch, the guitarist and vocalist for Fleetwood Mac; the couple invited Bob to move into their home in Laurel Canyon. Bob and Jimmy became good friends, and shortly after Bob moved in they had a discussion about Welch's desire to leave Fleetwood Mac. (Left to Right) Bob Welch and Jimmy Robinson at the Record Plant LA – Studio C Robinson suggested bringing in former Jethro Tull bassist Glen Cornick and ex Nazz drummer Thom Mooney for a new project and brought the band to John Carter at Capitol Records. The new group was to be called Paris, and the idea was embraced by Al Courey, then head of Capitol's A&R; department. =The Record Plant, L.A.= Every Sunday night at 6 pm, Gary Kellgren would throw a special A-List only party bearing the name \\"The Jim Keltner Fan Club Hour\\" after world-famous drummer Jim Keltner, who was well known in musician's circles at the time. Austin Godsey, who lived with Jack Adams across from Frank Zappa's house in Laurel Canyon, invited Robinson to the latest \\"The Jim Keltner Fan Club Hour\\" party at The Record Plant in Los Angeles. Upon arrival at the Record Plant, Robinson was asked by Kellgren to help out with recording the artists during the jam session. The artists at the studios that evening were John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Jessie Ed Davis, Danny Kortchmar, Trever Lawrence, Bobby Keys, Jim Price, Jim Keltner, Ringo Starr, Bruce Gary, Wolfgang Metz, Rocky Djubano, Mike Finnigan, Al Kooper, Harry Nilsson, Vennetta Fields, Clydie King, and Claudia Lennear, all appearing on a track to be entitled \\"Too Many Cooks are Bound to Spoil the Soup\\". The engineers for the session were Gary Kellgren, Lee Kiefer, Austin Godsy, and Robinson. The current location of the original 16 track master is unknown to this day; however, bootleg 2 tracks have surfaced from time to time on the internet. From left to right: (Playing Guitar)Jessie Scotland, (Vogue Model) Angeleen Gagliano and (Producer) Jimmy Robinson, (Record Plant Owner) Gary Kellgren and Kristin Gaines While working on Paris, Robinson received a phone call from Ben Edmonds from Capitol Records A&R; department and asked him to work with Jimmy Page on a new group signed to Swan Song Records. The group was to be called \\"Detective\\" and Robinson was to serve as producer and engineer for the first album. This album turned out so well that many Led Zeppelin fans thought that Jimmy Page had produced it under the pseudonym \\"Jimmy Robinson\\". After Detective, Robinson began two albums with Sammy Hagar. The first project with Hagar was 9 on a Ten Scale and then subsequently Red. Shortly after working with Hagar, Lou Bramey of Spread Eagle Productions asked Jimmy Robinson to record and produce Y&T;'s Struck Down album for London Records. The album Struck Down is best remembered for Dave Meniketti's heavy guitar leads that was preceded the metal scene by a decade. During his tenure with the Record Plant in Los Angeles, Jimmy developed an even closer friendship with Gary Kellgren and the two of them took over Sly Stone's custom project studio in Sausalito, CA called \\"The Pit\\" that featured eccentric amenities such as a recessed recording area with shag carpeting and secret passages; there, they worked closely with Sly Stone, Paris, Sammy Hagar, Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, and Tower of Power. =Gary Kellgren= The sudden death of his close friend Gary Kellgren in 1977 devastated Robinson. Although he continued to work at The Record Plant Los Angeles, the infamous studio didn't feel the same and so with great sadness Robinson left to pursue other endeavors. After completing that project, Robinson took a job working A&R; for Capitol Records where he helped with the development of several punk rock bands, most notably \\"The Dogs\\". After getting word that his mother's health was not good, Robinson moved back to NYC to be close to her and work as a freelance engineer. =Chun King , Sony Music, MTV, NYC= As an independent engineer Jimmy Robinson found himself highly sought after as a consultant and began working for numerous companies of those included; MTV headquarters in NYC, Chun King Studios, and Sony Music for Tommy Mattola and Dave Smith. Jimmy Robinson 2009 =2003 to present= Jimmy Robinson worked as a freelance engineer right up until his death and produced records with his own small company Ear Candy Audio Productions based in NYC. In addition to his production work he was also an active member of The International Communications Industries Association, A.R.R.L. (Ham Radio), a voting member of National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (N.A.R.A.S./Grammys), and voting member of the Audio Engineering Society (A.E.S.).

The Sculpture Garden is the result of an International Sculpture Symposium held in the town in 1976. There are currently 27 pieces created by various artists from 6 different countries, including, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, and the United States. The symposium project won the town of Liberty Hill the first Texas Arts Award for a city with a population under 100,000 in 1977.Little, Carol Morris. A Comprehensive Guide to Outdoor Sculpture in Texas. pp. 314-315 History =International symposium= In the early 1970s, Mel Fowler, a painter and sculptor, came to Liberty Hill, Texas. Fowler attended an International Sculpture Symposium in Europe in 1975. On his return to Liberty Hill he began to organize a site for the first international sculpture symposium in the southwest. Initially, Fowler aimed to host the symposium in Austin, Texas, but a local of Liberty Hill, James Vaughan, convinced him to hold the symposium in the small town. In celebration of the U.S. bicentennial, during the fall of 1976, the town hosted 25 sculptors from 6 different countries. Many local families provided room and board for the artists, and many local organizations provided meals. Local companies also supplied all of the materials for the sculptures. Native granite, concrete, and steel were the primary materials used. The entire symposium took place without any state or federal money. The symposium resulted in a park of abstract sculptures located in downtown Liberty Hill at Veterans Park. =Dedication= The sculptures remained in Veterans Park for 10 years while Fowler attempted to raise funds to buy a larger piece of land for the sculptures. In the mid-1980s, Don Cunningham, a new administrative assistant for Liberty Hill Independent School District, wished to purchase a piece of granite from one of the sculptures for a sign for the new high school. After negotiations, the school district accepted all of the sculptures as part of a landscape for the high school. On May 5, 1987, after a massive moving effort, the sculptures were dedicated on the grounds of Liberty Hill High School (now Liberty Hill Middle School). It became the only recorded site of an International Sculpture Park on school grounds. Several sculptures were added after the symposium and dedication, including one by Jim Thomas and several by Mel Fowler, bringing the total to 27 pieces in the park. Future Currently, some of the sculptures are being moved from the middle school to the adjacent Lions Foundation Park, run by the Liberty Hill Development Board. The sculptures will remain partially on the school grounds, partially in Foundation Park, with a clear walking trail between the pieces. A re-dedication of the park is set to occur in late April 2013. Sculptors and sculptures The following lists the sculptors and the piece created for the park at Liberty Hill. The list is categorized by country of origin or residence. Some artists have two countries listed due to multiple residences at the time of the symposium. Two pieces from the original symposium were destroyed as noted. Thomas created a sculpture for the dedication in 1987, and Fowler added three pieces after the original symposium. =Canada= *Harry Noordhoek (Canada and Italy) - Fluidity *Bart Shigeru Uchida - Crawling Venus *Dieter Hastenteufel (Canada and Germany) - Frozen Motion =Italy= *Renato Mari - Faces of the People =France= *Jean Marmorat - Sans Titra *Jean Paul Philippe - Tirez Moi De La =Germany= *Renata Reck - Evolution No. 2 =Japan= *Masayuki Nagase - Lover's Seats *Mihama Yoshinao - Lotus =U.S.= *Duff Browne - Images *Catchi - Official Artist of the 1976 Symposium *Sharon Corgan Leeber - Liberty Couple *Dolores Cumley - Origin *Nati Escobedo - Tierra Madre *David Eugene Everett - Untitled (Destroyed by vandalism) *Mel Fowler: Liberty Cat Libertarian Misterio di Vita San Francescao *Brad Goldberg - Guardian *Mary Paige Huey - Phoenix (Molds were damaged by foundry in process of re-work) *T.J.

His reign was troubled, being marked by conflicts with some of his brothers, antagonism with the various branches of the Buyids for influence in Baghdad, and attacks by the Byzantine Empire under John I Tzimiskes. His relations with the Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al- Dawla Bakhtiyar, were initially hostile, but the two later concluded an alliance. In 978, the Jazira was occupied by the Buyids of Shiraz under 'Adud al-Dawla, and he fled to the Fatimid-controlled parts of Syria, where he tried to secure the governorship of Damascus, and became involved in local rivalries which resulted in his defeat in battle and execution on 29 August 979. Life =Origin and background= Family tree of the Hamdanid dynasty Abu Taghlib was the eldest son of al-Hasan, better known by his laqab of Nasir al- Dawla, who had established the Hamdanids as masters of a practically independent emirate encompassing the Jazira and centred on Mosul. Nasir al- Dawla engaged in repeated attempts to gain control over the Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad, but in the end was forced to concede defeat to the more powerful Buyids, recognize their suzerainty and pay them tribute.Canard (1971), p. 127Kennedy (2004), pp. 268–271 At the same time, Nasir al-Dawla's younger brother Ali, better known as Sayf al-Dawla, managed to establish his control over northern Syria from his two capitals Aleppo and Mayyafariqin, and through his clashes with the Byzantine Empire quickly overshadowed his brother. However, the last decade of Sayf al-Dawla's rule, until his death in February 967, was marked by heavy military defeats at the hands of the Byzantines, who occupied much of his domains, and internal turmoil.Canard (1971), p. 129Kennedy (2004), pp. 273–280 It was in this context that Abu Taghlib is first mentioned in 964, when his father had once again been embroiled in a conflict with the Buyids. The army of the Buyid Mu'izz al-Dawla occupied Mosul and Nasir al-Dawla was once again forced to flee to the hill country of the northern Jazira. Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a new agreement with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly eclipsed by his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.Kennedy (2004), p. 271 =Reign= Map of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), the homeland and main power base of the Hamdanids Abu Taghlib, surnamed al-Ghadanfar (\\"The Lion\\"), succeeded his father as emir and head of the Jaziran branch of the Hamdanid family, but almost immediately his authority was contested by a younger half-brother, Hamdan. Nasir al-Dawla had entrusted the latter with the governance of Nisibis, Maridin and Rahba shortly before his deposition, and may have intended to name him as his heir over Abu Taghlib. Hamdan was indeed the only son of Nasir al-Dawla to protest his father's deposition, and refused to recognize Abu Taghlib. With the aid of the new Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar, Abu Taghlib prevailed over Hamdan, who fled to Baghdad.Canard (1971), pp. 127–128Kennedy (2004), pp. 271–272Kraemer (1992), p. 89 In addition, Abu Taghlib used the conditions of near-anarchy prevailing in Syria at the time and after Sayf al-Dawla's death to expand his territory at the expense of his cousin, Sa'd al-Dawla. Upon Sayf al-Dawla's death, Abu Taghlib seized Raqqa and Rafiqa, and by 971 he had extended his control over all of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar, once part of Sayf al-Dawla's domain, uniting the entire Jazira under his rule. Sa'd al-Dawla, deprived of his own capital and lacking any power to offer any resistance, tacitly accepted these losses as well as his cousin's suzerainty.Canard (1971), pp. 127–128, 129 As ruler of the Jazira, Abu Taghlib was one of the richest rulers of the region; Ibn Hawkal's descriptions attest to the wealth derived from the many Hamdanid estates, and Ibn Miskawayh, who was tasked with inventorying the family's mountain strongholds after the Buyid dissolution of the Hamdanid emirate in 979, writes of the immense cash reserves stored there.Holmes (2005), pp. 262–263 esp. note 43 Relations with the Buyids were initially good, as Abu Taghlib, unlike his father, had no direct claim on Baghdad, and Bakhtiyar himself was too preoccupied with affairs in Iraq and elsewhere to focus his attention on the Jazira. However, the Buyid prince offered refuge to Hamdan and other disgruntled members of the Hamdanid clan (including another of Abu Taghlib's brothers, Abu Tahir Ibrahim) and intervened in the Hamdanid family quarrels.Canard (1971), p. 128Kennedy (2004), p. 272 Thus in 970 Hamdan was restored in Rahba thanks to Buyid pressure, only to be chased away again in 971. The exiled prince now urged Bakhtiyar to make war on Abu Taghlib: in 973 the Buyids once again occupied Mosul, while Abu Taghlib with his army outflanked them and threatened Baghdad. The conflict ended in a negotiated settlement in 974 that included in its provisions the award of the laqab of ʿUddat al-Dawla (\\"Instrument of the Dynasty\\") to Abu Taghlib by the caliph and the restoration of Hamdan to his domains. During the same period, Abu Taghlib also faced the attacks of the Byzantines, who under Emperor John I Tzimiskes penetrated deep into the Jazira, forcing the Hamdanids to pay tribute. The devastating raids of 972 were partly avenged through the defeat and capture of the Domestic of the Schools Melias at Amid in 973, but in 974 Tzimiskes himself raided the Jazira in retaliation.Holmes (2005), pp. 308, 325–326Kraemer (1992), pp. 89–90 Map of Iraq in the 9th–10th centuries In 973–975, Abu Taghlib supported Bakhtiyar in his own struggles to safeguard his power. Thus he once again marched on Baghdad during the rebellion of the Turkish military commander, Sabuktigin, although it was the intervention of the Buyid emir of Shiraz, 'Adud al-Dawla, that decided the conflict for Bakhtiyar. As a result of his assistance, in 975 Abu Taghlib secured a revision of the earlier treaty which freed him from the payment of tribute.Kennedy (2004), pp. 223–224 In 976, following the death of Tzimiskes, Abu Taghlib agreed to support the bid for the Byzantine throne of the rebel general Bardas Skleros, with whom he concluded a treaty whereby the Hamdanid ruler supplied Skleros with light cavalry in exchange for an unspecified marriage agreement.Holmes (2005), p. 262 In 977, as Bakhtiyar found himself driven from Baghdad by the ambitious 'Adud al-Dawla, he turned again to the Hamdanids for aid. Abu Taghlib agreed to support him in exchange for the handing over of Hamdan, who was promptly executed. Although this secured Abu Taghlib's position in his family, it also brought him to the attention of 'Adud al-Dawla. In May 978, Bakhtiyar and Abu Taghlib were defeated in a battle near Samarra by 'Adud al-Dawla. Bakhtiyar himself was captured and executed at the orders of 'Adud al-Dawla, who then advanced on Mosul.Kennedy (2004), pp. 272, 230 Unlike earlier Buyid expeditions against the Hamdanids, that had failed chiefly because they were unable to sustain themselves in the Jazira, this was far better organized, as 'Adud al-Dawla brought along experienced administrators familiar with the area. The Buyids took Mosul and forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Mayyafariqin and then to the mountains of Armenia; while the Buyids laid siege to Mayyafariqin, he even visited Skleros in Byzantine territory in Anzitene, trying to secure his assistance, but in vain, for Skleros too was hard-pressed by the loyalist general Bardas Phokas. After the fall of Mayyafariqin in 978, Abu Taghlib fled to Rahba, from where he tried in vain to negotiate with 'Adud al-Dawla.Holmes (2005), pp. 265–266 =Exile and death= With the Buyid troops completing their conquest of the Jazira, and unable to seek aid from his cousin Sa'd al- Dawla, who had already acknowledged 'Adud al-Dawla's suzerainty and was under orders to arrest him, Abu Taghlib with his remaining followers crossed the Syrian Desert to the Fatimid-controlled south of Syria. There he became embroiled in the complex power struggles between the Fatimid government and local elites. He endeavoured to gain recognition by the Fatimids as governor of Damascus, but the rebel general al-Qassam, who held the city, repulsed him. Under attack by the Damascenes, and with members of his family starting to desert him, Abu Taghlib moved further south to the region of Lake Tiberias. Abu Taghlib's ambitions and his contacts with the Fatimids now came to threaten the position of Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah, a Tayy chief and ruler of Ramla. Hoping to sow dissension among the Arab tribes of the area and strengthen Fatimid authority, the Fatimid general Fadl now promised Ramla to Abu Taghlib, who openly allied himself with Mufarrij's rivals, the Banu Uqayl, and attacked Ramla in August 979. Fadl's troops, however, came to the aid of Mufarrij, and in the ensuing battle on 29 August Abu Taghlib was taken captive and executed.Gil (1997), pp. 354–356 The Jazira remained under Buyid control until 989, when Abu Taghlib's brothers Abu Abdallah Husayn and Abu Tahir Ibrahim, who had submitted to the Buyids, were installed as governors to oppose the power of the Kurdish chieftain Bādh ibn Dustak, who had taken control of Mosul. In this fight, the two brothers relied upon the Uqaylis; after the defeat of Bādh, the Banu Uqayl turned on the Hamdanids and deposed and killed Abu Tahir Ibrahim, establishing the Uqaylid Dynasty as the rulers of the Jazira.Canard (1971), pp. 128–129Kennedy (2004), pp. 272–273 References Sources  * * Category:10th-century births Category:979 deaths Category:10th-century rulers in Asia Category:Hamdanid emirs of Mosul Category:Iraqi Shia Muslims Category:Arab people of the Arab–Byzantine wars Category:10th-century executions Category:Year of birth missing Category:10th- century Arabs ","title":"Abu Taghlib"},{"id":"36687791","text":"Smyrneika Ke Laika (Greek: Σμυρναίικα και λαϊκά) is the name of a studio album by popular Greek singer Tolis Voskopoulos.

It was released in December 1983 through Dischord Records. Like other influential D.C. records, it was released after the band had broken up. For the band's only other release after their split LP with Void, Edward Janney added some second guitar. Overview Allmusic described it to be \\"hot-wired classic hardcore outrage and self-questioning, as before\\" giving it 4 stars out of 5; and also praised the production. Don Zientara once again handled the recording, with Ivor Hanson's drumming sounding both stronger and also a touch more accomplished. Bass and guitar seemed to have switched positions of prominence in the mix, with Mike Hampton's crunch a touch more subtle and Chris Bald's own crisp work more directly audible. It makes for a calm but interesting contrast; in combination with the fine if not especially original songs, the result is more prime hardcore. Alec MacKaye still screams with passion but also has a little more open ache slipping through here and there, which goes well with the lyrics of songs like \\"Limitations\\" and the combination of reflection and call to action in the especially inspiring title track. It all makes for a fine way for this solid band to be remembered. As the record progresses things get even more dynamic. \\"Say No More\\" finds Alec near-singing, and ends with four hand claps. Also, rather than snarling that he wants to make society bleed, he drops lines like \\"It's a feeling coming from your heart. Don't want to stop it, just want to know how it starts.\\" If listened closely enough on \\"Aware\\" and \\"More of the Same,\\" something can even be noticed, something more or less alien to hardcore records of the era: guitar solos. As an exceptional record, not only because of its heavy, melodious (but not poppy, in fact punk) sound, but because of its great personal, introspective lyrics, things one can really relate to; it is far from a transitional record; the eight songs on Subject to Change are totally complete and powerful. The scene, however, was about to raze itself and start again from scratch. The record, in its music, lyrics, and especially the title song, was a forecast of the great things to come. Influence When The Faith released it in 1983, the record marked a critical evolution in the sound of D.C. hardcore and punk music in general. Alec MacKaye's voice is still as bitterly venomous as ever on the lead track \\"Aware,\\" but the new dual guitar version of The Faith was a far cry musically from the tracks on the Void split. The record (along with the previous year's LPs by Scream and Marginal Man) did not only pave the way for bands like Dag Nasty, Rites of Spring, obviously Embrace (which is the same band except for an exchange of MacKaye brothers and the absence of Eddie Janney) and Fugazi who would continue to combine desperate introspective lyrics with angry, melody-tinged songwriting that moved even further from the hardcore formula, but also a subsequent generation of bands such as Nirvana and Sonic Youth. Subject to Change deserves to be thought of as one of the first melodic hardcore records, as significant to the form as Bad Religion or the Descendents; the whole scene would sound markedly different without this precursor. The Faith strove for fewer personally destructive and more thoughtful and introspective lyrics, and it is little surprise that the band went in the direction they did after their split. Their last release began to push the boundaries of early post-hardcore.

Wales returns and rushes to Phyllis' arms, not knowing she has married Hector. Wales accuses Hector of taking advantage of his absence, and Phyllis rushes to get a divorce in Nevada. Hector follows and becomes acquainted with an attractive grass widow. Reading Wales' book The Primitive Lover, Hector decides to put its methods into practice. He kidnaps Phyllis and Wales and in a cabin in the mountains Phyllis sees how helpless Wales is. From an Native American guide Hector learns how to subdue an unruly wife, and he tries it on Phyllis with complete success. She apparently likes the rough treatment, and is happier still when the Nevada judge denies her requested divorce.

History The museum was established in 1954 by the authorities of Međimurje County as Čakovec Town Museum and opened to the public in 1955. At the beginning it was housed in the exhibition halls inside the fortified outer buildings of the castle. Later it was enlarged, renamed and transferred to the three-storey inner palace of the castle complex, so it has around today. Function The museum is a regional cultural heritage museum. It collects, preserves, maintains, displays, exhibits and interprets artifacts pertinent to the history of Međimurje County. It also gives expert help, guiding services and other informational services, organizes educational lectures and specialized exhibitions, publishes expert books and has other activities. Departments and collections Among the museum's exhibits are a lot of local artifacts and archeological findings dating from prehistory to recent history (20th century). A series of rooms depicts different periods of history and include information boards. Themes covered include ethnographical heritage and the history of the local economy. There are five departments in the museum aiming to promote the county's rich legacy of heritage, culture and arts: archeology, ethnography, cultural history, history and visual arts gallery. The last includes the memorial collection of Ladislav Kralj–Međimurec (1891–1976), a notable Croatian painter and engraver. The five departments comprise a total of 18.993 exhibited items distributed in 51 various collections, including a lapidarium situated in the inner courtyard (atrium) of the Zrinski palace, with a large number of stone monuments exhibited in the open air.

Lendink became notable for an incident in August 2012 where it was assumed to be an illegal file-sharing website, despite its legitimacy, leading to its temporary shutdown after the site's owner and host received hundreds of cease and desist and takedown notices. History In 2011 Amazon allowed authors to publish their books through Kindle Direct Publishing. It gave authors the ability to sell their books directly to consumers via the Kindle Store. An author had two royalty levels to choose from. If they published their book at the 70% royalty level, the book would be lendable. If it was published at the 35% royalty rate, an author could opt in or opt out of the feature. Lending through both providers lasted for 14 days. A book could only be lent out once. Lendink debuted in 2011 as a virtual book club. It allowed owners of ebooks to offer their copies up to be loaned. If a person wanted to borrow a book, they would send an email through the website to the person offering a book to be borrowed. The transaction would happen via the Amazon or Barnes & Noble software. The site did not host the books and operated off of no income. It was only a facilitator of activities that were authorized by the author or publisher. If a book was not authorized to be lent by the publisher, the option would be grayed out on the site. As of June 2013, the website stopping its hosting services from GoDaddy so ceased functioning. =Takedown= At the beginning of August 2012, someone took a glance at Lendink's website and interpreted it as a file-sharing website. They proceeded to tell as many authors as they could over social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. The message spread quickly, passing mouth to mouth from author to author. Cease and desist letters and takedown notices started to pour into the website's internet service provider. The website was pulled after mounting legal threats which numbered in the hundreds. Following the shutdown, a crowdfunding effort began to provide a financial base for re- opening the website. On August 24, 2012 Lendlink was officially re-opened; while the site did receive several takedown notices following the re-opening, the legitimacy of these requests was questioned. Reactions The takedown sparked dialogue among opinion writers. The website's critics have defended their actions based on the fact that the intellectual property owners did not directly authorize the website. Its defenders pointed out that the owners did authorize the loaning out of the ebooks and that ignorance of the terms and conditions would not exempt the authors from them. One commentator pointed out that the takedown was a direct side effect of Digital Rights Management. They pointed out that few people would have complained if people were swapping physical copies of books.

Originally formed as the 'soil survey group' of the 'Geological Survey,' they became the 'Soil Survey Division' in 1936 and 'Soil Bureau' in 1945. Established adjacent to Taita College on approximately 90 acres on the Eastern Hills of Lower Hutt north of Wellington, the foyer featured a large mural by Ernest Mervyn Taylor depicting a cloaked figure using a kō (Māori digging stick). Soil Bureau completed nationwide soil surveys of New Zealand. The impetus for forming a separate unit related to soil science was work in the 1930s by Leslie Grange and Norman Taylor which showed a correspondence between soil type and bush sickness in cattle, which led to the discovery that ash-based soils in the central North Island were Cobalt deficient and that cobalt-enriched salt licks could open up tens of thousands of acres to dairy farming. Soil Bureau was renamed as DSIR Land Resources in 1990 and then reformed into Landcare Research in 1992 by the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992, but the name remains protected under the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981. Many Soil Bureau publications were digitised by its successor organisation.

It is one of the leading local manufacturers. History The company originates from a rum business founded in the 1840s by Jose Gomes D'Aguiar, which expanded into a chain of liquor stores. The business grew in 1885 with the addition of a Cocoa and Chocolate Factory and a Schooner Shipping Agency. In 1896 the four sons of the founder formed the D'Aguiar Bros partnership, and bought the Demerara Ice House (DIH). The building, which contained a hotel, soft drink plant and liquor bars, got its name from holding ice imported by schooner from Canada. The company got into difficulty, and in 1934, the year in which Peter D'Aguiar took over DIH from his father, the last of the four sons, the business was on the verge of bankruptcy. Peter D'Aguiar placed greater emphasis on the core business of manufacturing soft drinks and rum, although the company retained retail outlets, bars and the hotel. The financial position gradually improved. In 1942 the company obtained the first Coca-Cola franchise in South America, and during the 1950s rum production also expanded. In 1955. Peter D'Aguiar promoted the publicly owned Banks Breweries Ltd. In 1966 D'Aguiar Bros. (D.I.H.) was floated as a public company, and it was merged with Banks Breweries in 1969 to form the present Banks DIH Ltd. Banks DIH was the first company to float shares publicly in Guyana. For a long time the capital market was small, only reaching US$10 in 1992. As of October 1993, Banks DIH had just 8,346 shareholders. Peter D'Aguiar also floated Banks Barbados in the 1960s, but the two companies soon separated, each marketing their own Banks Beer. Both companies saw demand from abroad for their products, but ran into brand ownership problems and other difficulties. In 2005 the two companies decided to market jointly, each buying shares in the other. It was decided to produce the beer in Barbados, including the Banks DIH Shandy range. The first shipment to the United States was made in 2008. Current operations The company today produces soft drinks, alcoholic beverages and food products, operates bars and restaurants, and since 1998 has owned a controlling share in Citizens Bank Inc. The company has branches and agents throughout the country and owns a large fleet of delivery vehicles. Products are exported to various Caribbean countries. In collaboration with Banks Holdings Ltd. (BHL Group) of Barbados, Banks Beer is exported to Canada and the United States. The BHL Group owns 20% of Banks DIH Limited and also owns 100% of Banks Barbados Brewery as well as shares of other companies in the Caribbean.

Recent events In October 2010 a boat carrying drinks and other products from the Banks DIH company to the Essequibo Coast developed leaks and had to be grounded on the Stewartville foreshore. Mud had got into the pump, which would not start, and the engine room flooded. After the tide receded, the boat leaned to one side. Some boxes fell off and were taken away by Stewartville residents. That night, dozens of people climbed onto the boat, taking soft drinks and alcoholic drinks, as well as other products such as biscuits and bottled water. The looting was thorough, including draining the fuel from the boat's tanks. Some started drinking while they were looting. One man, apparently drunk, fell into the water and drowned between the boat and the sea wall. In January 2012 the company announced plans to create a $21 million Sports Bar in Stabroek Market Square, downtown Georgetown, and to renovate the Demico House building. Banks DIH operates a sports field, and sponsors various sporting events. Banks DIH faces competition from ANSA McAL and Demerara Distillers Ltd, two other large Guyana beverage companies.

Her name has doubtfully been linked to two Welsh churches and is found in manuscripts from the collection of Iolo Morganwg making historical evidence of her existence dubious and limited. Eigen is noted as the first female saint and daughter of Caratacus in the History of Dunraven Manuscript, a manuscript giving the genealogy of Taliesin from the collection of Thomas Hopkin of Coychurch, one from the Havod Uchtryd collection and in an extract he claimed to have copied from the Long Book of Thomas Truman. This reference can also be found in the family records of Iestyn ab Gwrgant, where it is said of her; \\"She lived in the close of the first century, and was married to Sarllog, who was a lord of Caer Sarllog, or the present Old Sarum\\". In this manuscript, Eigen is said to have returned from Rome with Caratacus with Saint Cyllin and Saint Ilid and formed a religious college of twelve named Cor Eurgain (the choir of Eurgain), suggesting the early entry of Christianity into Britain; \\"the Cymry embraced the faith in Christ through the teaching of the saints of Cor-Eurgain\\". Attempts have also been made to identify Eigen with the Claudia mentioned by Saint Paul in the Second Epistle to Timothy, however evidence for this is largely coincidental. Some authors also claim she was called Gladys on the suggestion that this was a Welsh word for princess. Eigen is also discussed as the first female saint in the works of Rice Rees, Jane Williams, Sabine Baring-Gould and John Williams (Ab Ithel). In the annals of Tacitus, a daughter of Caratacus is mentioned appearing in front of the Roman Senate and Emperor Claudius in approximately 53 CE. Caratacus' daughter is never named in the record of Tacitus and she is not mentioned with her mother, father and uncles as having been given a pardon from the brutality of a Roman execution by the Emperor.Tacitus, Annals 12:33-38Tacitus, Annals 13:32 Eigen features in a cantata by Edward Elgar in 1897-8 devoted to the defeat and capture of the king by the Romans. It was first performed at the Leeds choral festival in 1898. Her name in the Cantana has variously been claimed to be both historical and derived from a neighbour of Elgar's in Malvern called Eigen Stone. Eigen, spelt as Eigon is also the subject of a modern, time-slip novel by Barbara Erskine called The Warrior's Princess, published in 2008. The parish church of Llanigon, Wales is dedicated to \\"Saint Eigon\\", but this almost certainly refers to Eigion, brother of St Cynidr, to whom the parish church in neighbouring Glasbury was dedicated. Another Welsh church in Northop (Welsh: Llaneurgain), Flintshire, is dedicated to \\"Saint Eurgain\\", said to have been the daughter of Prince Maelgwn Gwynedd and niece of St. Asaph. She is said to have lived in Flintshire in the 6th century CE and has a feast day on 30 June. There is evidence that the church of St Eurgain and St Peter has existed since the 6th century.

(SS&E;) is an American sports & entertainment organization, based in San Antonio, Texas. The company owns and operates several sporting franchises including the National Basketball Association (NBA) San Antonio Spurs, NBA G League Austin Spurs, and the USL Championship club San Antonio FC. SS&E; also operates the Bexar County-owned multi-purpose facility, the AT&T; Center. A 2013 Forbes article called the San Antonio Spurs \\"North America's best run professional sports franchise,\\" and ESPN named the Spurs as the best sports franchise in all major sports in 2014. It was the third time the Spurs received the ESPN honor, and the franchise has ranked in the Top 10 every year since the survey was introduced in 2003. Properties =San Antonio Spurs= The San Antonio Spurs are an American professional basketball team based in San Antonio, Texas. They are part of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). They were NBA champions in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014. The Spurs are one of four former American Basketball Association teams to remain intact in the NBA after the 1976 ABA–NBA merger and the only former ABA team to have won an NBA championship. The Spurs' five NBA championships are the fourth most in history behind only the Boston Celtics (17), Los Angeles Lakers (16), and Chicago Bulls (6). The Spurs currently rank first among active franchises for the highest winning percentage in NBA history. In their 38 NBA seasons since 1976–1977, the Spurs have won 20 division titles. They have made the playoffs in 24 of the last 25 seasons (since 1989–1990) and have missed the playoffs four times since entering the NBA; they have not missed the playoffs in the 18 seasons since Tim Duncan was drafted by the Spurs in 1997. With their 50th win in the 2014–2015 season, the Spurs extended their record for most consecutive 50+ win seasons to 16 (the 1998/1999 season was shortened to 50 games because of a lockout and based on their win percentage of .740, would have easily surpassed 50 wins in an 82-game season, and thus extend the record by 2 more seasons). Thus, since the 1997/1998 season, the Spurs have had 21 consecutive seasons with a winning percentage of .610 or greater during the regular season which is also an NBA record. AT&T; Center The AT&T; Center is a multi-purpose indoor arena on the east side of San Antonio, Texas. It seats 18,581 for basketball, 16,000 for ice hockey, and up to 19,000 for concerts or religious gatherings, and contains 2,018 club seats, 60 luxury suites and 32 bathrooms. The arena was completed in 2002, as the SBC Center. While Bexar County owns the arena, SS&E; is partnered with the county to manage the day-to-day operations of the AT&T; Center. The AT&T; Center is undergoing a renovation of more than $100 million, with improvements that include expanded entrances, renovated concourses, new concessions and bar areas, a larger Fan Shop and a new HD video scoreboard. Renovations are scheduled to be completed before the 2015-16 season. =San Antonio FC = San Antonio FC are an American professional soccer team based in San Antonio, Texas. Founded in 2016, the team debuted in the United Soccer League that same year. It was announced as the league's thirty-first franchise on January 7, 2016.

The team was founded in Salt Lake City, Utah as the Utah Starzz before the league's inaugural 1997 season began; the team moved to San Antonio before the 2003 season. The Stars qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in seven of their twelve years in San Antonio. The franchise while in San Antonio was home to many high-quality players such as all-star point guard Becky Hammon, solid power forward Sophia Young, two #1 overall draft picks in Ann Wauters and Kelsey Plum, and seven-foot-two-inch center Margo Dydek. In 2008, the Silver Stars went to the WNBA Finals. On August 5, 2014, Hammon was hired by the Spurs as an assistant coach, becoming the second female assistant coach in NBA history but the first full-time assistant coach. This also made her the first full-time female assistant coach in any of the four major professional sports in North America. In October 2017, multiple media reports indicated that SS&E; was nearing completion of the sale of the Stars to a group that would move the team to Las Vegas for the 2018 season and beyond. The team was sold to MGM Resorts International and moved to Las Vegas prior to the 2018 WNBA season, and is now known as the Las Vegas Aces. =San Antonio Rampage= The San Antonio Rampage were an ice hockey team in the American Hockey League.

The term derives from the then capital and seat of the caliphal court, Samarra. The \\"anarchy\\" began in 861, with the murder of Caliph al-Mutawakkil by his Turkish guards. His successor, al- Muntasir, ruled for six months before his death, possibly poisoned by the Turkish military chiefs. He was succeeded by al-Musta'in. Divisions within the Turkish military leadership enabled Musta'in to flee to Baghdad in 865 with the support of some Turkish chiefs (Bugha the Younger and Wasif) and the Tahirids, but the rest of the Turkish army chose a new caliph in the person of al-Mu'tazz and besieged Baghdad, forcing the city's capitulation in 866. Musta'in was exiled and executed. Mu'tazz was able and energetic, and tried to control the military chiefs and exclude the military from civil administration. His policies were resisted, and in July 869 he too was deposed and killed. His successor, al-Muhtadi, also tried to reaffirm the Caliph's authority, but he too was killed in June 870. With Muhtadi's death and the ascension of al-Mu'tamid, the Turkish faction around Musa ibn Bugha, closely associated with Mu'tamid's brother and regent al-Muwaffaq, became dominant in the caliphal court, ending the \\"anarchy\\". Although the Abbasid Caliphate was able to stage a modest recovery in the following decades, the troubles of the \\"Anarchy at Samarra\\" inflicted great and lasting damage on the structures and prestige of the Abbasid central government, encouraging and facilitating secessionist and rebellious tendencies in the Caliphate's provinces.

It features Sidway's siblings, James and Parnell, posing for a photograph in an artist's studio. The children were painted posthumously based on family daguerreotypes, and the painting has been read as representing the tension between its medium and the emergent medium of photography. Interior with Portraits is currently held by the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. About The painting features two children, James and Parnell Sidway, posing for a photograph in an artist's studio. The painting was commissioned by the subjects' older brother, Franklin Sidway. Parnell was an adolescent when she died of illness in 1850, while James was a 26-year-old volunteer firefighter who died in a hotel fire shortly before the painting was commissioned. The likenesses of the subjects as children were painted from family daguerreotypes. Some painters of the time regarded photography with suspicion, and refused to use photographs as references for portraits. The painting is filled with references to this tension. The children are surrounded by painted portraits, and the photographer's back is to the viewer with his face obscured. The girl appears to be supporting the boy and holding him still, as might have been necessary when posing a child for an early photograph due to the long exposure time. A dog is depicted just entering the studio, another acknowledgement of early photography's limitation to still subjects. Smithsonian Museum of American Art The painting is currently owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the purchase was made possible by a bequest of Pauline Edwards in 1993.

Hua Tou can be translated as 'word head', 'head of speech' or 'point beyond which speech exhausts itself'. A Hua Tou can be a short phrase that is used as a subject of meditation to focus the mind. Origins Hua Tou are based on the encounter-dialogues and koan of the interactions between past masters and students, but are shorter phrases than koans. The Hua Tou method was invented by the Chinese Zen master Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163) who was a member of the Linji school. Dahui was interested in teaching the lay community, particularly the educated Chinese scholar-officials. Support of those \\"literati\\" was essential for the survival of the individual lineages, since appointments as abbot of public monasteries were determined by this ruling class. Providing accessible methods of training for layman was a means to gather this necessary support. Hua Tou practice does not use regular interviews and question and answer sessions between student and teacher (dokusan). According to Dahui, Hua Tou is also a form of meditation that \\"can be carried out by laymen in the midst of their daily activities.\\" Dahui was also against the intellectualism and literary commentary that had begun to enter into Koan practice with the Blue Cliff Record of his master Yuan-wu. In fact, Dahui burned his copy of the Blue Cliff Record. Formal Hua Tou practice was promoted in Korea by Seon master Chinul. He was extremely successful in popularizing Hua Tou. According to Robert Buswell: According to Bhikkhu Analayo, a similar practice is found in the Pali commentaries relating to mindfulness of bodily postures. Analayo writes that according to the Papañcasudani \\"the difference between simple walking and walking meditation as a Satipatthana is that a meditator keeps in mind the question: \\"Who goes? Whose is this going?\\" (Ps I 251).Analayo, Satipatthana: the direct path to realization, page 139. Practice Dahui emphasised that initial insight is essential for Zen-training. Dahui stressed that it was possible for laymen to achieve enlightenment through this practice. He often gave instructions through letters to his pupils. Chinul described Hwadu (Hua Tou) in his treatise Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record () as a practice that leads to the very limits of speech and acts as a purification device. Because the practice leads students beyond conceptual understanding, Chinul considered an advanced practice for those of particular talent, or those who had already advanced through other practices first. To practice Hua Tou, one concentrates on the phrase, initially repeating it silently with a questioning and open mind and then thinking about \\"Who\\" or \\"What\\" is generating the Hua Tou, this brings about \\"Great Doubt\\". Hua Tou can be practiced during sitting meditation, after the mind has been calmed through an initial period of breath meditation. Hsu Yun said of practicing Hua Tou: According to Chan master Sheng Yen, there are three stages of Hua Tou practice: reciting the Hua Tou, asking the Hua Tou and investigating the Hua Tou. Through these stages it is important not to try to answer the Hua Tou intellectually, but to persistently ask the question mindfully with genuine interest and sincere desire to know. It is through this constant practice that great doubt and then insight arises. Examples of Hua Tou According to Stuart Lachs, there are various popular Hua Tous such as:Lachs, Stuart, Hua-t’ou: A Method of Zen Meditation, 2012. *“What is it?” - very popular in Korean Seon *“What is this?” *“Who is repeating the Buddha’s name?” - Popular with Chinese who also practice nianfo. This Huatou changes nianfo into a Chan practice. *“Who is dragging this corpse around?” - popularized by Hsu Yun, who often recommended it as a first practice, it was given to him by Master Yang-jing of the Tian-tai sect. *“Who am I?” *“What was my Original face before my father and mother were born?” - from the Sixth Patriarch Huineng, and the 23rd case in the well known koan collection, the Mumonkan *“What is Mu?” - This is taken from the famous kōan, Joshu’s Mu which goes as follows, “A monk asked Joshu, ‘Does a dog have Buddha-nature or not?’ Joshu replied, ’Mu.” Notes References Sources  * Further reading * Cleary, JC.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82339 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Chico in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Scheina, p 72 Construction and design details Point Chico was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Chico included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in- charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History After commissioning, Point Chico was stationed at Sausalito, California, from 1963 to 1965 where she was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. On 14 June 1965 she escorted the damaged FV Salmon Queen from eighteen miles southwest of Point Bonita, California to Sausalito. In 1966 her homeport was shifted to Benicia, California where she helped fight a barge fire in San Francisco harbor on 26 September 1966. In 1974 Point Chico was transferred to Yerba Buena Island. She and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation for her part in fighting a fire that engulfed Pier 37 at the Port of San Francisco's Embarcadero and saving the historic ferry boat San Leandro. She received a second unit commendation for rescue and relief operations during flooding of the Noyo River basin in October 1977. On 7 April 1980 she towed the disabled tanker Austin into the wind 35 miles northwest of Morro Bay, buying time for engineers working on damaged wiring as the tanker drifted toward the Piedras Blancas.Scheina, p 73 After 4 August 1980 Point Chico was stationed at Bodega Bay, California. On 9 September 1983, she towed the disabled pleasure craft Sabra into San Francisco. On 16 September, she towed the disabled FV Huyne Long from off Farallon Island to San Francisco. On 8 November she rescued two divers off Mendocino, California.Scheina, p 73 Point Chico received her third unit commendation for participation in the Olympic Security Task Force during the 1984 Summer Olympics held at Los Angeles, California from 7 July to 15 August 1984. She was awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for search and rescue and law enforcement operations from 1 January to 9 April 1985. when her crew seized the FV Oregon Beaver with of marijuana on board.

The company's headquarters and educational programs are based in Los Angeles, California. Its research and production facilities are located in Salt Lake City, Utah; Monterrey, Mexico; Baotou, China; and Manchester, UK. History American Elements began as a toll chemical manufacturer and refiner serving U.S. mining companies by producing metal- based chemicals from their deposits. In 1998, its two largest customers, the Unocal/Molycorp rare-earth mine in Mountain Pass, California and the Rhodia rare-earth refinery in Freeport, Texas closed, ending domestic U.S. rare-earth production. In response, the company established mining joint ventures in Inner Mongolia, China and in 1999 became one of the first post-Cold War companies to export rare-earth metals from China to the U.S. and Europe. Over the following decade the company expanded operations to include production of all elements on the periodic table and established educational programs, scholarships and scientific conferences to educate the public on the properties and applications of the elements. In 2001, it launched its website, which is a compendium of information on the elements and advanced materials including properties, uses, safety data, and academic research. That same year, the company established its research and development department with the stated goal of developing new materials and the cost effective processes necessary to scale their production to bulk quantities. Materials with application promise that could not be effectively scaled were abandoned in favor of materials and technologies that had the added benefit of being producible at costs in line with their commercial application. Many of the technologies and materials developed at American Elements were co-designed and co-developed with technology collaborators. The company develops and commercializes technology materials in partnership with the U.S. military and 30 percent of the Fortune 50 list of companies. = Innovations = The company has made several new discoveries in materials science. These include: * Gadolinium nitrate made with heavy water (Gd(NO3)3 · 2H2O) for use as a neutron \\"getter\\" during nuclear reactor maintenance * A rare-earth compound used as a dry-film lubricant at extremely high temperatures and pressures * A nanoscale \\"quick-dissolve\\" powder used in orally disintegrating pharmaceuticals * A neodymium oxide-based additive to reduce yellow-green wavelength emission in incandescent light bulbs * Zinc oxide nanoparticles incorporated as an antimicrobial agent in textiles * A high-purity form of ytterbium(III) fluoride for use as a radiopaque material in dental composites * Iridium parts for the jewelry industry, most notably pure iridium rings and wedding bands. The company established Smithson Tennant, a new wholly owned subsidiary, in November 2016 to make and market its iridium jewelry production. Product lines The advanced materials manufactured by the company include: * Ultra-high-purity forms of each element * Bulk chemicals, research compounds and catalysts * Rare earths * Nanomaterials such as nanoparticles and graphene * Sputtering targets and evaporation materials * Organometallics * Alloys, superalloys, and metal parts * Pharmaceutical precursors Educational programs In 2006, the company established the not- for-profit American Elements Academics & Periodicals Department. The department provides information on (1) the ways elemental advanced materials are used, (2) global issues affecting the mining and production of the elements and (3) ways to improve the teaching of science at all grade levels. Since its founding, the department has sponsored thousands of conferences on materials science, the elements, mining, and physics. In 2011, it co- sponsored, along with the National Science Foundation, a four-part PBS Nova television series on materials science called \\"Making Stuff\\". The department promotes improved transparency in global metal markets. It believes future global rare-earth prices tend to move upward or downward in reaction to China's then-projected GDP (gross domestic product). The company publishes an annual Endangered Elements List naming that year's top five elements that, due to their geopolitical scarcity, pose a threat to the future of American high- technology manufacturing. Leadership Michael Silver is the founder and CEO of American Elements. He is considered an expert in the fields of rare earths, particularly in the political and economic issues surrounding the global supply chain, and writes and speaks frequently on the subject. Silver coined the phrases \\"Innovation Distortion\\", a description of efforts to avoid the use of a given element solely because of concerns that it may be hoarded by nations with resource control of that material, and the \\"Environmentalist's Catch-22\\" to describe the dilemma faced by those who both support a green technology future reliant on solar energy, wind power, electric cars and fuel cells and concurrently oppose the mining of the critical metals from which these technologies are manufactured. Silver is also an active philanthropist in the science and arts. In 2011, he funded and hosted a delegation from the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California to the Inner Mongolian Medical Teaching College in Baotou, China which has led to student and teacher exchanges and the development of a joint AIDS program. He is a trustee of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Sarara Initiative in Northern Kenya and the council of the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. He also serves on the council for the Getty Villa in Malibu and has underwritten artists in residence at the UCLA Hammer Museum.

Family William More was the son of Sir Christopher More, King's Remembrancer of the Exchequer (c.1483–16 August 1549), and Margaret Mugge or Mudge, the daughter of Walter Mugge (d.1495) or Mudge of Guildford, Surrey, by his wife, Joan.. He was the grandson of a London fishmonger, John More, and his wife, Elizabeth. After the death of Margaret Mugge, More's father married, by 1535, Constance Sackville (d.1554), the daughter of Richard Sackville, but there were no issue of his second marriage.; ; . More had four brothers (Richard, two brothers named Christopher, and John), all of whom died without issue, and seven sisters, Elizabeth; Cecily; Margaret, who married Thomas Fiennes, brother of the Lord Dacre; Eleanor, who married William Heneage of Milton; Bridget, who married a husband surnamed Compton, of Guernsey; Anne, who married John Scarlett; and Elizabeth, who married John Wintershall or Wintershull. Career No evidence survives of More's education.. His political career began early. He was elected to the Parliament of 1539 under King Henry VIII, and both he and his father were elected to the Parliament of 1547, his father as Knight of the Shire and William as the Member for Reigate. More is said to have avoided the 'political entanglements' of the reign of King Edward VI,More, William (1520–1600), History of Parliament. Retrieved 14 February 2013. and in particular to have avoided involvement in the Duke of Northumberland's attempt to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne after the young King's death. During King Edward's reign More developed close connections with an influential courtier, William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, the brother of Henry VIII's last wife, Catherine Parr, an association which is said to have been an indication of More's 'Protestant convictions'. In some of his letters from that time Northampton refers to More as his servant. He was elected three times as the MP for Guildford (in 1553, 1554 and 1555). According to Robison, during the reign of Queen Mary I, More's religious views, like those of another of his close friends, Sir Thomas Cawarden, were Protestant. More 'opposed Marian religious policy in the 1555 parliament, was hauled before the council for \\"lewd words\\" in 1556, and was reprimanded for his remissness in investigating conventicles in 1557'. Nonetheless, the Privy Council gave him 'important responsibilities' during the final months of Mary's reign, and with the accession of a Protestant sovereign in November 1558, More's career 'flourished'. A succession of appointments quickly came his way. He was Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1558–9, Vice-Admiral of Sussex from 1559, verderer of Windsor Forest in 1561, Constable of Farnham Castle in 1565, and Deputy Lieutenant for Surrey and Sussex from 1569. From 1562 to 1568 More built Loseley House, described as 'the best house of its date in the county'. According to Nichols, More entertained the Queen there in 1577, and again in 1591.; . According to Robison, the Queen also visited Loseley in 1567, 1569 and 1583. More was appointed a commissioner for ecclesiastical causes in 1572, and both before and after that appointment actively assisted with the regime's enforcement of religious reform, dealing with sects such as the Family of Love as well as with Catholic recusants. Despite this, More was a lifelong friend of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montague, who had Catholic sympathies and who openly opposed the Elizabethan religious settlement.. More was also a friend of Montague's son-in-law, Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, who was for a time his prisoner at Loseley. On 15 July 1570 the Privy Council placed Southampton in More's custody after it was learned that he had secretly met with John Lesley, Bishop of Ross, in Lambeth Marsh. More was instructed to induce Southampton to take part in Protestant devotions in his household, and after doing so, Southampton was allowed his freedom in November 1570. However a year later, in September 1571, under questioning about the Ridolfi plot, the Bishop of Ross incriminated Southampton by revealing the entire contents of their secret conversation at Lambeth. Southampton was arrested at the end of October and confined to the Tower for eighteen months. He was finally released on 1 May 1573, and again placed in More's custody at Loseley until 14 July. Although More had been Southampton's jailer, relations between them were more than cordial; on 6 October 1573 Southampton wrote elatedly to More to announce the birth of his son and heir, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton.; . More was knighted by Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, acting on behalf of the Queen, at Pyrford, Surrey, on 14 May 1576.. More served in every Parliament during Queen Elizabeth I's reign. He was Member for Grantham in Lincolnshire in 1559, for Guildford in Surrey in 1572, 1589 and 1597, and sat as Knight of the Shire for Surrey in 1563, 1571, 1584, 1586 and 1593. He was Sheriff of Surrey a second time for 1579–80. He served as a Chamberlain of the Exchequer from 1591 until his death. More died 20 July 1600. He was buried in the Loseley Chapel in St. Nicolas' Church, Guildford, where a monument depicts More, his second wife, Margaret Daniel, and their three children.; ; ; . Many letters and other documents concerning Sir William More have survived in the Loseley manuscripts..Manuscripts of More Molyneux Family of Loseley Park, National Archives. Retrieved 13 February 2013. More and the Blackfriars On 12 March 1550 Edward VI had granted to More's friend, Sir Thomas Cawarden, a large part of the site of the former Blackfriars monastery in London which Cawarden had been leasing since 4 April 1548.. Cawarden died in 1559, and More, who was his executor, acquired the property in that year from Lady Cawarden.. According to notes made by More (Folger Library MS L.b.425),.Loseley Manuscripts, Folger Shakespeare Library. and other documents, More leased part of the property on 10 June 1560 to Sir Henry Neville. and then, at Neville's request, to Richard Farrant, who converted the premises into a playhouse for the Children of the Chapel. Farrant also sublet part of the premises, for which infraction More claimed Farrant had forfeited his lease, but before More could regain possession, Farrant died on 30 November 1580,. leaving the lease in his will to his widow, Anne,. the daughter of Richard Bower (d.1561), Master of the Choristers of the Chapel Royal. On 20 December 1581, after Farrant's death and after Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, had intervened on behalf of William Hunnis, Master of the Children of the Chapel, Farrant's widow, Anne, sublet the premises in the Blackfriars to Hunnis and John Newman.. Hunnis and Newman later transferred their interest to a Welsh scrivener, Henry Evans.. More than brought suit in June 1583 against Evans,. and in Michaelmas term 1583, after first appealing to Sir Francis Walsingham,. Anne Farrant brought suit against both Hunnis and Newman. In November 1583 Hunnis petitioned the Queen, and in January 1584 both Hunnis and Newman sued Anne Farrant.. In the midst of this legal confusion, as Wallace puts it, 'the Earl of Oxford stepped in', and Evans sold his sublease to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who retained it for some months before granting it in June 1583 to his servant, John Lyly.. Finally, after a delay of a year, the court gave judgment in More's favour in his lawsuit against Evans. More was granted possession of the Blackfriars property in Easter term 1584, and the first Blackfriars Theatre was closed.; . In January 1596 More sold part of his property in the Blackfriars for £600 to James Burbage, who turned it into the second Blackfriars Theatre. However residents of the Blackfriars successfully petitioned the Privy Council to forbid playing there, and in 1599 Burbage leased the property to the same Henry Evans whom More had earlier sued.

Plot Eve Mason is a \\"white- skinned\\" African American who inherits a large amount of land after the death of her grandfather Dick Mason, an old prospector. She leaves her hometown of Selma, Alabama for the Northwest to settle in a place called Oristown. Upon arrival she decides to stay in the Driscoll Hotel but its owner, Jefferson Driscoll, a self-hating light-skinned black man, is passing as white and scorns the company of other African Americans. Driscoll forces Eve to sleep outside in his barn, where she is menaced by another black man Driscoll has sent to sleep there. Exhausted from her journey but too terrified to stay in the barn, Eve runs out into the woods, and Driscoll laughs uproariously at her distress. In the morning, she meets a kind, young prospector named Hugh Van Allen, who happens to be her new neighbor. Van Allen is also African American, but doesn't realize that Eve is too. They become fast friends, and Van Allen offers Eve a ride to her new house. When they get there, Van Allen continues to show kindness and helps Eve get settled into her little cabin. Before leaving, he gives Eve a gun and tells her to shoot it twice if she's ever in trouble. That way he will know to come right over. The Symbol of the Unconquered On the other side of town, August Barr and Tugi, a couple of criminals, are meeting with Barr's brother-in-law Peter Kaden. They tell Kaden that they need a couple of important documents, most of which he can find at Dick Mason's house and force him to go and retrieve the documents himself. He goes there later that night and peeks his head in the window, startling Eve so much that her scream is heard by Van Allen. Kaden is able to run away before being discovered by Van Allen, who calms Eve down and even offers to keep watch outside for the rest of the night. The next day Driscoll, who has quit the hotel business, sells two stolen horses to Van Allen. Before long Van Allen is approached by the horses’ real owner and learns of Driscoll's true nature. He confronts Driscoll at the local saloon where the two men have a physical altercation, which ends with Van Allen as the winner and Driscoll proclaiming that he will have his revenge. Later Driscoll's mother, whose dark features Driscoll despises, comes to town and runs into Eve, who befriends the woman despite still having ill feelings towards her son. At the post office Driscoll picks up a letter meant for Van Allen that was accidentally dropped by the mail man. After reading it he learns that Van Allen's land has incredible value and shows the information to Barr and Tugi. They enlist the help of Bill Stanton, a Ku Klux Klan member, and continually leave threatening notes outside of Van Allen's tent in order to get him to sell. This doesn't work however and Bill Stanton decides to ride onto the land one night with other Klan members. Their attack fails thanks to some help from other members of the community, specifically a colored man with a brick, and afterwards Van Allen finally learns that the reason his land is so sought after is because of the abundance of oil fields. Two years go by and Van Allen has become one of the oil kings, running his own company. Eve drops by to deliver a letter from The Committee for the Defense of the Colored Race that reveals Eve's black parentage. The film ends with Van Allen learning the truth and the two of them declaring their love for each other.

He is the father of mathematician John Torrence Tate Jr.  Biography  Tate was born on 28 July 1889 in Lenox, Iowa. He attended the University of Nebraska, studying electrical engineering, earning a BS in 1910. He continued at the University of Nebraska, shifting his focus to physics and earning an MA in 1912. Like many American students interested in pursuing advanced degrees in physics, he departed for Germany to further his studies, earning a PhD under James Franck in 1914, with a dissertation on \\"The Heat of Vaporization of Metals.\\" He returned to the University of Nebraska as a faculty member, where he stayed until 1916, when he was offered a post at the University of Minnesota. With the exception of brief sabbaticals to conduct war-related work, Tate remained at Minnesota for the following 34 years. Tate Laboratory of Physics at the University of Minnesota is named in his honor.  Editor of Physical Review  While a professor at the University of Minnesota, Tate presided over the growth of the Physical Review into a high impact journal. Physicist John H. Van Vleck, who was a colleague of Tate's at Minnesota from 1923 to 1928, recalled that in the early 20th century \\"The Physical Review was only so-so, especially in theory, and in 1922 I was greatly pleased that my doctor’s thesis was accepted for publication by the Philosophical Magazine in England . . . By 1930 or so, the relative standings of The Physical Review and Philosophical Magazine were interchanged.\\" Alfred Nier and John Van Vleck credited the rapid growth of the journal's size and influence in the 1920s to Tate's sensitivity to the importance of the emerging quantum revolution, and in particular the rapidity with which he published papers relating to quantum phenomena.  Reviewing Einstein and Rosen  On the 1st of June 1936 Tate, as the editor of the Physical Review, received a submission from Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen. Tate sent the submission to H.P. Robertson, who made an anonymous critical peer review, questioning the basic conclusion of the paper. On the 23rd of July, Tate returned the submission with the anonymous review.

The infighting has lasted through 2013, although the Metros have gained the advantage and regained control of the major cities controlled by the cartel when it was essentially one organization. Originally, the two factions were formed in the late 1990s by Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the former leader of the criminal organization. After the drug lord's arrest and extradition in 2003 and 2007 respectively, the control of the Gulf Cartel went on to his brother Antonio Cárdenas Guillén (Tony Tormenta) and close associate Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez (El Coss). But the differences between the two factions began in 2010, when Juan Mejía González of the Rojos was overlooked as the regional boss for Reynosa, Tamaulipas during a cartel shift and appointed to a less-important territory. In the assignment, Flores Borrego of the Metros was given Reynosa, suggesting that the Metros were above the Rojos. When Antonio was killed by the Mexican marines on 5 November 2010 in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, his faction – the Rojos – perceived that the Metros had tipped the Mexican authorities to Antonio's whereabouts. Those who were more loyal to the Cárdenas drug family stayed with the Rojos, while those loyal to Costilla Sánchez stayed in the Metros. In efforts to seek revenge for the death of their leader, Mejía González and Rafael Cárdenas Vela, the nephew of Antonio, allegedly ordered the execution of Flores Borrego, the second-in- command in the Metros faction. With his death, both two factions turned their guns against each other and went to war in the Mexican northern state of Tamaulipas, and reportedly offered information to U.S. authorities on the location of cartel members hiding in the United States. In the infighting, many high-ranking members of the Gulf Cartel have been killed or arrested. In some cases, however, the drug-related violence extended across the U.S.–Mexico border in South Texas, prompting debates on the possibility of \\"spillover violence\\" from the Mexican Drug War. The fight has forced the Rojos to barricade in Matamoros, Tamaulipas while the Metros make their final incursions to put them down. In order to do so, Costilla Sánchez of the Metros allegedly worked with the Sinaloa Cartel and Joaquín \\"El Chapo\\" Guzmán. Nonetheless, after the arrests of Costilla Sánchez and Cárdenas Guillén, it is difficult to predict what fate lies ahead for the Gulf Cartel and Mexico's criminal underworld. Background In the late 1990s, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel, had other similar groups besides Los Zetas established in several cities in Tamaulipas. Each of these groups were identified by their radio codes: the Rojos were based in Reynosa; the Metros were headquartered in Matamoros; and the Lobos were established in Laredo. The infighting between the Metros and the Rojos of the Gulf Cartel began in 2010, when Juan Mejía González, nicknamed El R-1, was overlooked as the candidate of the regional boss of Reynosa and was sent to La Frontera Chica, an area that encompasses Miguel Alemán, Camargo and Ciudad Mier – directly across the U.S.–Mexico border from Starr County, Texas. The area that Mejía González wanted was given to Samuel Flores Borrego, suggesting that the Metros were above the Rojos. Unconfirmed information released by The Monitor indicated that two leaders of the Rojos, Mejía González and Rafael Cárdenas Vela, teamed up to kill Flores Borrego. Cárdenas Vela had held a grudge on Flores Borrego and the Metros because he believed that they had led the Mexican military to track down and kill his uncle Antonio Cárdenas Guillén (Tony Tormenta) on 5 November 2010. Other sources indicate that the infighting could have been caused by the suspicions that the Rojos were \\"too soft\\" on the Gulf Cartel's bitter enemy, Los Zetas. When the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas split in early 2010, some members of the Rojos stayed with the Gulf Cartel, while others decided to leave and join the forces of Los Zetas. InSight Crime explains that the fundamental disagreement between the Rojos and the Metros was over leadership. Those who were more loyal to the Cárdenas family stayed with the Rojos, while those loyal to Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, like Flores Borrego, defended the Metros. Originally, the Gulf Cartel was running smoothly, but the infighting between the two factions in the Gulf Cartel triggered when Flores Borrego was killed on 2 September 2011. When the Rojos turned on the Metros, the largest faction in the Gulf Cartel, firefights broke throughout Tamaulipas and drug loads were stolen among each other, but the Metros managed to retain control of the major cities that stretched from Matamoros to Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas. Two other factions in the cartel, Los Ciclones and Los Escorpiones, reportedly engaged in a power struggle on 1 February 2012 in Matamoros. 'Spillover' violence ;McAllen, Texas shooting On 27 September 2011 at around 2 a.m. in McAllen, Texas, fatal gunshots were exchanged from one vehicle to another along an expressway. A man named Jorge Zavala and a 22-year-old man were victims of an attack perpetrated by unknown shooters traveling in a dark-colored SUV from a Chevrolet Tahoe, causing them to lose control of the vehicle and crash along the expressway. The local police did not find a motive for the attack, but sources told The Monitor that Zavala had ties with a faction of the Gulf Cartel in the Mexican border cities of Matamoros and Reynosa, showing signs that his assassination was due to an \\"internal power struggle\\" in the organization. Zavala died instantly at the scene, while the other man was taken to the hospital in critical condition. The McAllen Police Department refused to comment on how many gunshots were fired, but the preliminary autopsy revealed that Zavala died of multiple gunshots, not from the crash. Public records prove that Zavala's criminal history dates back to 1995, while sources familiar with the victim stated that he was a close associate of the drug lord Gregorio Sauceda-Gamboa. A local law enforcement official who asked not to be identified stated that Samuel Flores Borrego's death and the power struggle in the organization may explain Zavala's death. Hours after Zavala's death, a series of grenade attacks prompted in Reynosa, Río Bravo, and Ciudad Victoria, while an intense gunfight took place in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. ;Sheriff shot in Elsa, Texas Mug shot of Flores Borrego. After Samuel Flores Borrego was killed, the Gulf Cartel had lost many of its drug loads to rival groups and its own members, so when the new leader was appointed, \\"one of the first directives issued was to recuperate its losses.\\" It is unclear how, but several Gulf Cartel members traced one of their stolen loads to a stash house of suspected dealers in Elsa, Texas on 1 November 2011. The cartel then called on an American-based prison gang to go and buy the loads to learn the location of the stash house. The gang dealers then went and bought the drugs from the dealers, but realized that it was not at the stash house were the goods were allegedly hidden. In an attempt to disclose the information to the dealers, the gang members kidnapped them, and that was when two country sheriffs received an emergency call a possible kidnapping. The policemen then spotted the gang member's Ford F-150 pickup truck and ordered the drivers to stop. While one of the policemen was speaking to the driver, the other approached the passenger window and was shot with a 9 mm gun. The policeman managed to survive because he was wearing a bullet vest. One of the gang members, however, was killed; the other was shot in the head and remained in critical condition. ;Kidnappings and extortions in South Texas On Memorial Day weekend in 2011, an alleged member of the Gulf Cartel pretended to be a policeman (he was in full uniform, with a pistol, handcuffs, and an embroidered shirt) and abducted a man named Ovidio Guerrero Olivares near Alton, Texas. Guerrero has not been seen by his family members and court records indicate that he \\"wasn’t even the target of a Gulf Cartel- ordered kidnapping.\\" The police learned more about the kidnapping when they arrested a some cartel members in Mission, Texas; one of the detainees admitted that Guerrero Olivares was kidnapped after the cartel boss in Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas issued a list of several people he wanted to be kidnapped in the Rio Grande Valley and sent south into Mexico for questioning after a load of cocaine was stolen. The kidnapper was sentenced to prison, while reports from within the organization state that the cartel boss of Miguel Alemán – Miguel El Gringo Villarreal – was killed in Valle Hermoso, Tamaulipas during the cartel infighting. In addition, the family of Guerrero Olivares fled and abandoned their house. On 6 December 2011, a high-speed chase and an attempted vehicle aggression by alleged cartel members on police officers in Palmview, Texas prompted a nine-shot confrontation. Isaac Sánchez Gutiérrez, the driver of the vehicle, managed to escape the scene and avoid capture, leaving behind a partner and a Ford F-150 pick-up truck the letters \\"CDG\\" – the Spanish acronym for the Gulf Cartel – spray-painted in the inside. The authorities later discovered more than 700 pounds of cannabis hidden inside the truck. Sánchez Gutiérrez was arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol agency after a vehicle-and-foot chase incident near Abram, Texas on 20 December 2011. While in custody, he claimed that a high-ranking leader of the cartel in Reynosa, Tamaulipas had coerced him to smuggle drugs across the border. According to his account, his brother Juan Armando had been involved in the drug business but was suspected by his Reynosa superiors of stealing US$2 million. Juan Armando was kidnapped at a convenience store in Reynosa, and several cartel members went to Isaac's home in Mission, Texas threatening to torture and kill his brother if the money was not returned. They issued him an ultimatum: Either gather US$4 million, or smuggle 50 drug across the U.S.–Mexico border into Texas to free his kidnapped brother. =Reactions= The debates over whether the violence in the McAllen metropolitan area should be considered an actual \\"spillover\\" from Mexico's drug war reignited when a sheriff from Hidalgo County, Texas was wounded in a shooting on 1 November 2011 with members of the Gulf Cartel. On one side, local and federal U.S. law enforcement agents claim that the drug-related violence coming from Mexico stops at the border. The other side, made up mainly from politicians, claim that the border regions are being \\"overrun by drug cartels.\\" The debate relies on exactly how both sides define a \\"spillover\\" occurrence. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defines a spillover incident as any crime that occurs in the United States that is directly tied with the violent conflicts in Mexico, either between law enforcement officials and drug traffickers, or between rival drug trafficking organizations. The Texas Department of Public Safety, however, defines a spillover as any drug-related violence. By the DPS standards, a conflict over a drug deal between the Sicilian Mafia and the Chinese triads in New York City can fall under the spillover category. Hence, the local authorities in South Texas have concluded that although violence does occur in their region, it is not directly related to Mexico but to individuals in the United States. According to the sheriff, after the death of Flores Borrego in September 2011, a gang in the United States were given orders by their Mexican superiors to recover a drug load that had been taken from the Gulf Cartel. The process did not go as planned and the gang members ended up kidnapping a group of dealers, leading to a shootout incident. The sheriff said that this \\"represents the only direct spillover\\" case of Mexico's drug war in South Texas, but stated that it was not directly related to Mexico. After this incident, Todd Staples, a Republican party Commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, set up a website asking the federal government to back state efforts to curb illegal activities along the Mexican border, and especially drug trafficking. In a report, Staples asked two decorated military generals to take on the assignment, and stated in September 2011 that \\"living and conducting business in a Texas border county is tantamount to living in a war zone.” Staples announced that Mexican drug cartels are seeking to create their own turf in the United States, but especially on the South Texas, which they consider \\"vulnerable.\\" The statement sparked criticism among local officials who argued that many of the Texan border cities have lower crime rates than cities like Houston, that are not along the border. Henry Cuellar, a Democratic party member and a U.S. Representative, strongly disagreed with Staples' assessment that the Texas border is a war zone or an area overrun by the Mexican criminal groups, and claimed that such claims simply create \\"confusion\\" and unnecessary alarmist reactions. On early November 2011, Greg Abbott, the Texas Attorney General, informed media outlets of a letter he sent to President Barack Obama on his failure to protect the border, and warned him that the drug violence from Mexico is increasingly \\"spilling over\\" the border, and urged Obama to \\"immediately dedicate more manpower to border security.\\" In the letter, Abbott wrote about the shootings and kidnappings that have been occurring in the Rio Grande Valley, and how these incidents are a \\"threat to national security.\\" Lupe Treviño, the sheriff that was wounded, disagreed with Abbott's statements in a meeting at the White House with several Department of Homeland Security agencies and Janet Napolitano, and claimed that he has implemented a four-step program designed to have all of his deputies undergo a special tactical training designed to apply SWAT-style techniques to tackle any violence along the border. He explicitly said that the \\"[U.S] border is not in chaos,” and that the claims by the Republicans were \\"untrue and unfairly painted.\\" Nevertheless, Carlos Cascos, the current Cameron County judge, questioned Treviño's comments through Facebook, and mentioned that if South Texas didn't have drug violence issues (as Treviño claimed in Washington), then Treviño's travel to Washington D.C. was completely unnecessary, which indicates that the sheriff's actions contradicted his statements. The claims that South Texas is a \\"war zone\\" and overrun by the drug trafficking organizations are not based on current crime statistics. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, the number of homicides in Hidalgo County, Texas in 2010 were considerably less than in other major cities across Texas. That year, 36 homicides were reported, while \\"Houston reported 269 homicides, Dallas reported 148, San Antonio reported 79, and Austin reported 38.\\" Arrests and killings =Dávila García's killing= On 11 October 2011, the struggle between the Metros and the Rojos intensified when the Mexican authorities found the body of César Dávila García inside an abandoned house in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. Inside the abandoned house, the corpse of El Comandante Gama, Dávila García's code name, had been shot with a 9 mm pistol. According to the Mexican authorities, the man was a top financial operator in the Gulf Cartel and a close associate of the former drug lord Antonio Cárdenas Guillén. After the drug lord's death, Dávila García became the regional drug baron of the coastal city of Tampico, Tamaulipas before moving back to Matamoros. Neither faction in the Gulf Cartel claimed responsibility for his death, but Mexican intelligence sources indicated that Dávila García was killed by the Metros. The assassination also happened a day after the Mexican Navy dismantled a network of the Gulf Cartel in three municipalities across Tamaulipas, where 35 cartel members were arrested. Ricardo Salazar Pequeño, the regional boss of the cartel in Ciudad Miguel Alemán, along with the cartel's accountant Gabriela Gómez Robles, were apprehended. In addition, several firearms, drug loads, and radio communication equipment were confiscated. =Matamoros prison massacre= On 15 October 2011 in the border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, a large-scale prison riot left 20 inmates dead and 12 others wounded. The brawl broke out between two inmates at around 8:00 a.m. but later extended to the rest of the prison. In the turmoil, the Mexican federal police and the Tamaulipas state police were summoned to help the guards regain control of the prison. The Mexican military later took control of the prison at around 10:30 a.m. News videos showed helicopters in the air over the watchtower. Later in the morning, the family members gathered outside the prison to await the news of their loved ones while Mexican authorities set up a booth to take care of their requests and inquires. According to The Monitor, sources confirmed that the prison brawl was related to the fight between the Metros and the Rojos. =Cárdenas Vela's arrest= On 20 October 2011, while heading to his luxury house in South Padre Island, Texas with his bodyguards and a lady, Rafael Cárdenas Vela, a drug lord of the Gulf Cartel and a leader of the Rojos, was pulled over and arrested in Port Isabel, Texas by the police who were reportedly working with federal agents that had been tipped to his whereabouts. Stratfor and the San Antonio Express-News released a report on 3 November 2011 putting more context on the arrest of Cárdenas Vela in South Texas and stated that the Metros had probably played a role in his arrest. The Monitor reported on 27 October 2011 that a rescue attempt for Cárdenas Vela was very unlikely. Despite being a powerful leader in the Gulf Cartel, his rude actions \\"burned many bridges in the organization.\\" A source outside law enforcement but with direct knowledge of the situation stated that Cárdenas Vela was \\"very hardheaded and impulsive,\\" which made him have many enemies in the organization. \\"(Some of the) comandantes are glad he is gone,\\" the source said. Moreover, Cárdenas Vela's arrest triggered a series of road blocks and gunfights in Valle Hermoso and Matamoros, Tamaulipas, the city in which he operated. By 27 October 2011, El Universal reported a total of 14 killings as a result of his arrest and of the Gulf Cartel infighting. =Ramos García's arrest= U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested Eudoxio Ramos-García, a former drug lord of the Gulf Cartel, in Rio Grande City, Texas on 31 October 2011. =Zúñiga Hernández's arrest= On 1 November 2011 in the city of Santa Maria, Texas, José Luis Zúñiga Hernández (Comandante Wicho), a high-ranking member of the Gulf Cartel, was arrested in Santa Maria, Texas on 26 October 2011 by U.S. Border Patrol agents. During his arrest, Zúñiga was carrying cocaine, $20,000 US dollars in cash, and a gold, diamond, and ruby encrusted .38 Super Colt handgun. The pistol has the name \\"Wicho\\" encrusted on it. He also \\"freely admitted\\" to be a Mexican national without documents to reside in the United States, while sources familiar with Zúñiga Hernández indicate that he turned himself in to American authorities. His attorney testified that ICE agents coerced Zúñiga Hernández to confess his crimes and cooperate with them in exchange for protection to his family and immunity from prosecution. The ICE agents denied such claims, however. Zúñiga Hernández was the cartel boss in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas after the death of Antonio Cárdenas Guillén (a.k.a. Tony Tormenta) on 5 November 2010. Nonetheless, according to court documents, he was ousted as the regional boss by Rafael Cárdenas Vela on 10 March 2011 after the internal feud in the Gulf Cartel, and fled to the United States illegally under death threats. He pleaded guilty to in January 2012 to firearm charges and illegal entry after being deported from the United States on 8 August 1997. Prior to his deportation, Zúñiga Hernández was found guilty on 14 February 1990 for marijuana distribution. He currently faces up to 20 years in prison after entering the U.S. illegally after deportation, and an additional 10 years for being an alien with a firearm. Each of these two convictions carries a fine of $250,000 U.S. dollars. On 24 January 2013, Zúñiga Hernández was sentenced to seven years in prison in Brownsville, Texas, after pleading guilty for illegal possession of firearms and for entering the United States unauthorized. =Cárdenas Guillén's arrest= Mario Cárdenas Guillén, wearing a black bullet-proof vest and flanked by two ski-masked marines, was presented on national television on 4 September 2012. According to reports issued by the Mexican Navy, Cárdenas Guillén was arrested a day before in the city of Altamira, Tamaulipas. At the time of his arrest, Cárdenas Guillén was carrying a rifle in front of a building entrance, along with $10,000 in cash, radiocommunication equipment, ammunition, several credit cards, and four envelopes containing cocaine. The arrest of Mario is one of the \\"highest-profile arrests in months\\" and a powerful blow to the Gulf Cartel, which lost much of its influence after it separated from Los Zetas in early 2010. =Costilla Sánchez's arrest= The Mexican Navy arrested Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, the supreme leader of the Gulf Cartel, on 12 September 2012 in the residential Lomas de Rosales neighborhood in Tampico, Tamaulipas without firing a single bullet. He was presented on camera in the morning of 13 September 2012, handcuffed and wearing a long-sleeve shirt. Ten bodyguards of Costilla Sánchez were also arrested during the operative. Ernesto Banda Chaires, one of the detainees, is believed to be the regional boss of the cartel in Tampico. In the Wednesday arrest, the Mexican authorities confiscated several assault rifles, pistols encrusted with jewelry, and a number of expensive-looking watches. When asked if he had anything to say about his criminal charges and if he had a lawyer, Costilla Sánchez shook his head. Present-day By December 2011, media reports indicated that Mario Cárdenas Guillén, the brother of the late Antonio Cárdenas Guillén and of the imprisoned Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, had assumed control of the Gulf Cartel. Nonetheless, Mario was not very active in his family affairs and his reluctance to get directly involved in the cartel's drug operations appears to have continued after the death of Antonio. The Mexican Navy, however, arrested him on 3 September 2012 in the city of Altamira, Tamaulipas. In addition, the current leader of the organization, Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, had been reclusive and never had a permanent spot, often retreating to one of his ranches where he gives orders. Costilla Sánchez never got involved in the day-by-day operations of the cartel, but it seemed unlikely that he will be replaced, given Mario's arrest and past behavior. In early 2012, the infighting between the Rojos and the Metros that left bloody confrontations and high-ranking arrests has diminished. Nonetheless, the Gulf Cartel had to change its logistics and reconstruct how it manages regional bosses, while other sources say that the Rojos are no longer part of the cartel. In the end, the control fell to the cartel members of the Metros faction, although the Rojos still has significant manpower. The Rojos and the forces loyal to the Cardenas drug family have barricaded in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, while their leader Juan Mejía González has fallen off the radar and has not been heard off since then. A day after several members of the Metros put up banners commemorating the late Samuel Flores Borrego on 6 August 2012, gunfighting occurred in the city, and the Metros' push in Matamoros is a sign that they are determined to remove people who turned against the organization in the past. However, while the Metros have gained the upper hand in the operations of the cartel, the infighting left them vulnerable to attacks. To be sure, any drug trafficking organization is vulnerable to attacks when infightings occur, but the Gulf Cartel's feud with Los Zetas will compound the problem and make the infighting even more volatile. The infighting and struggle between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas has surely weakened both organizations, but Los Zetas continue to control key territories in Tamaulipas and seems to have the advantage of recruiting seemingly limitless gunmen from South America, while the Gulf Cartel is opting for young, less-experienced recruits from its territories. Moreover, the cartel infighting can open doors for Joaquín \\"El Chapo\\" Guzmán of the Sinaloa Cartel to send gunmen to Tamaulipas. The current alliance between the Sinaloa cartel and the Gulf Cartel is only a \\"marriage of convenience;\\" the ultimate goal of El Chapo Guzmán is to take over Tamaulipas, and working with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez was his only access. Costilla Sánchez, on the other hand, needed the Sinaloa cartel's support to fight off Los Zetas and settle disputes with the Rojos. =Costilla Sánchez's and Cárdenas Guillén's arrests= The capture of Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez and Mario Cárdenas Guillén leaves the Gulf Cartel without a definite successor. Both arrests in effect wipe out the traditional old-time bosses of the cartel, putting an end to a generation of drug traffickers. When Cárdenas Guillén was arrested on 4 September 2012, it looked as if Costilla Sánchez had finally won the leadership of the Gulf Cartel. Throughout the end of 2011 and until the time of his arrest in 2012, Costilla Sánchez had carried out a campaign to put down Cárdenas Guillén and his faction – the Rojos – by reportedly setting up its members to get arrested or killed. His attempts to successfully put down his rivals allegedly gave him the protection of some high-ranking officials in the Mexican Armed Forces. Nonetheless, Costilla Sánchez's own tactics backfired after a group of his henchmen arrested in Río Bravo, Tamaulipas reportedly betrayed him and notified the authorities of his whereabouts. It is also possible Cárdenas Guillén's declarations resulted in the apprehension of Costilla Sánchez too. Without a clear successor of Costilla Sánchez, his faction – the Metros – could come to an end, although it is still likely that there are other old-crime boses of lesser importance still trying to keep the Gulf Cartel standing. With the recent arrest of a Gulf Cartel representative in Colombia, the drug business could be disrupted even further. One clear benefactor of the fall of the Gulf Cartel is its rival group, Los Zetas. It is also possible that the several within the Gulf Cartel may decide to join the Sinaloa Cartel or Los Zetas, although the latter seems unlikely given the bitter sentiment both groups have planted. Currently, Los Zetas is also experiencing a power struggle within its own ranks, so the future of the Gulf Cartel is difficult to predict. =Metro 4's assassination= El Metro 4, a high-ranking lieutenant of the Gulf Cartel, was reportedly killed by Los Zetas or by members of his own cartel on January 15, 2013.

The cross section of thin walled beams is made up from thin panels connected among themselves to create closed or open cross sections of a beam (structure). Typical closed sections include round, square, and rectangular tubes. Open sections include I-beams, T-beams, L-beams, and so on. Thin walled beams exist because their bending stiffness per unit cross sectional area is much higher than that for solid cross sections such a rod or bar. In this way, stiff beams can be achieved with minimum weight. Thin walled beams are particularly useful when the material is a composite laminate.

Biography Popham was born on 11 November 1581. He was the eldest son of Alexander Popham of Huntworth and Dowsabell, daughter John Bayley of ?Salisbury, Wiltshire, and educated in the law at the Middle Temple (1600). He was a cousin of Edward Popham, the Naval Commander and MP. He inherited estates from his father in 1602. In May 1607 Popham abandoned the law to sail on an expedition to establish a colony at Sagadahoc, Maine. This colony, established by his great-uncle, Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham, and led by his uncle, the Bridgwater merchant George Popham, failed within two years. Popham was a Justice of the Peace for Somerset from 1607 to 1626 and was appointed Sheriff of Somerset for 1622–1623. He was elected MP for Bridgewater in 1621, 1624, 1625 and 1626. Popham was constantly beset by financial difficulties and was forced to sell his estates and around 1630 was forced to flee to France to escape his debtors. He died childless and bequeathed his remaining estate, to which his title was by now disputed, to his brother. Family Popham married twice: firstly Dorothy (died 1614), the daughter of Richard Bartlett of Berkshire, with whom he had a son who predeceased him and secondly Anne, the daughter of Henry Gifford and the widow of Sir John Portman of Orchard Portman, Somerset.

It lies to the northeast of Aspatria and south of Abbeytown, just to the southwest of Bromfield. Historically, it formed part of the Langrigg and Mealrigg township, in the Parish of Bromfield, then an independent parish from 1894 until 1934. Geography Threeways, Langrigg Langrigg is located along the A596 road. It is relatively low-lying, at the extremity of what was described in the late 18th century as a \\"dull and dreary common\\", although the land immediately around it is fertile. Its name is derived from the ridge of land along which it is located to the east of Bromfield. A river, named Ranny Gill, flows on the eastern side of the village. The township covers an area of 865 ha and includes part of Bromfield Common. A stream known locally as Dub Stangs rises to the west of Langrigg, and flows into the Solway Firth at Allonby Bay. History Waldieve, Lord of Allerdale, gave the manor of Langrigg to Dolphin, son of Aylward, whose family held it for generations until it fell to a family who took their name from the township. A Thomas de Langrigg once held property in Langrigg during the reign of Henry II, Langrigg Hall being the principal manor house. Agnes, wife of Gilbert de Langrigg, is documented to have \\"demanded against John Crookdake 25 acres of land, 15 acres of meadow, and 2s 4d rent there; and against Thomas de Langrigg 30 acres of land, and 14 acres of meadow\\". The historical township includes Bromfield, Greenhow and Crookdake, the latter of which was held for many years by the Musgrave family. Langrigg Hall Langrigg later fell into the Porter and Osmunderly families; the Osmunderly were of Lancashire origin. The Porters held the manor, while the Osmunderlys held the demesne. It was owned by William Osmunderly, Sheriff of Cumberland, during the reign of Henry IV. The last of the Osmunderleys, Reverend Salkend Osmunderely, sold the manor to his son in-law Thomas Barwis in 1735 (Barwis is credited with reconstructing the Langrigg Hall). John Barwis (1775–1818), who was also Rector of Niton in the Isle of Wight, was one of its prominent owners. and his son William Barwis, was still in possession of Langrigg manor in 1860. In 1876, its ownership changed to Joseph Bowerbank of Cockermouth. The township of Langrigg had a population of 198 in 1801, 194 in 1821, 269 in 1841, and 281 in 1851. The united township of Langrigg and Mealrigg in Bromfield parish became an independent parish following the Local Government Act of 1894, although for ecclesiastical purposes it remained attached to Bromfield. Langrigg Hall Farm produces free-range eggs for Morrisons supermarket. Economy Tile-making has been a local industry since the 19th century. A windmill was also established here in the 19th century.

The game is a large grid on the map of Japan and nearby waters. There are 25 grids (7 of which contain Japan and one containing Tokyo.) Godzilla is randomly set in any of the 25 grids except the grid with Tokyo. The player has a choice of attacking Godzilla or moving troops. You are given a choice of attacking with a land attack, sea attack, air attack, a missile or an atom bomb. When choosing an air, land or sea attack you must choose how many troops, boats or jets you want to send out (you can only send out how many of the given attackers are in the grid that Godzilla is.) You can also move troops and boats to different grids as opposed to attacks. After an attack it will show the number of attackers killed and how effective the attack was.

It allows the NYPD to track surveillance targets and gain detailed information about them, and is overseen by the counterterrorism bureau. The system is connected to 18,000 CCTV cameras video cameras around New York City. It also has access to data from at least 2 billion license plate readings, 100 million summonses, 54 million 911 calls, 15 million complaints, 12 million detective reports, 11 million arrests and 2 million warrants. The data from the CCTV cameras is kept for 30 days, the LPR readings for at least 5 years. Text records are searchable. The initial cost of development was funded by $350 million in Federal Homeland Security grants. The software component of the system is also licensed out to other cities with New York City getting 30% of the profits. So far the system has been licensed by the Washington DC Metro Police, the Brazilian National Police, and the Singapore Police Force. This system is highlighted in a May 2013 episode of PBS' Nova on tracking the Boston Marathon bombers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. History NYPD vehicle with tablet computer installed. 55 Broadway, home of Lower Manhattan Security Coordination Center (LMSCC) which is the hub of the Domain Awareness System According to internal NYPD documents, prior to 2002 the Department's information technology capabilities were managed by police officers as opposed to IT professionals. After his appointment in 2002, Commissioner Raymond Kelly placed software professional James Onalfo in charge of the NYPD's Office of Information Technology in 2003, beginning a period of widespread modernization. The NYPD's digital overhaul led to the launch of a data warehouse known as the Real Time Crime Center in 2005, and in 2008 the development of a network of security cameras and automated license plate readers which comprise the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative. After a terrorist car bombing attempt in Times Square in 2010, city officials increased efforts to expand the prototype surveillance system from Lower Manhattan into other areas of the city. In August 2012, the NYPD in partnership with Microsoft announced the launch of a Domain Awareness System that would cover all of the five boroughs. Although the system was framed as a counter-terrorism measure, it was acknowledged at the time that any data collected could be used for law enforcement purposes. In 2014, after the City of New York received $447 million in forfeitures from French bank BNP Paribas, a sum of $160 million was allocated to the NYPD Mobility Initiative in which handheld devices were distributed to officers and ruggedized tablets installed into police vehicles. With these devices, officers were able to access a mobile version of the DAS from anywhere in the city.  Capabilities  Fixed sensors at the landing of the Manhattan Bridge. = Hardware = The backbone of DAS is a network of thousands of physical sensors. NYPD vehicle with mobile license plate readers. Private CCTV cameras which are part of the DAS. The most widespread are the network of approximately 9,000 CCTV cameras, owned either by the NYPD or private actors, which are used to generate an aggregate citywide video stream, which are maintained for 30 days, and can be searched in realtime by officers. Search queries may include physical characteristics such as shirt color. Search results include live video feeds of all individuals fitting a given query within a given region. The Intercept has claimed that the search functionality extends to racial characteristics such as skin tone. Helinet technologies gave a press release in 2014 stating that they were selected by the NYPD to deploy a custom technology suite to four of the NYPD's Bell 429 GlobalRanger helicopters which \\"instantl[y] overlays critical information such as addresses, points of interest and other data on top of the live video and then transmit[s] the video and data in real-time via secure microwave downlink\\" to handheld devices of officers in the field. NYPD Bell 429 Helicopter.There are also several hundred automated license plate readers (LPR's) deployed throughout the city, with 50 fixed cameras on bridges and tunnels entering Manhattan and running the full length of Canal Street. These sensors record every spotting of license plates on a NYPD-defined \\"watch list,\\" generating roughly 3 million records per day. However, all license plate readings are stored for a minimum of five years regardless of whether or not the plate is on any watchlist. Officers can be alerted whenever a pattern of repeated visits to the same location or route is observed, with the stated goal of making it easier for officers to interdict and apprehend the drivers of monitored vehicles more efficiently than is possible with GPS tracking. A FOIL request by the NYCLU revealed a $442,5000 contract with Vigilance Solutions to provide access to real-time and historical license plate records from around the country. Additionally, DAS pulls in data from dozens of radiation and chemical sensors located on key infrastructure and precinct roofs, gunshot detectors, and cell tower simulators spread throughout the city. = Software = A machine learning algorithm known as Patternizr is included in the DAS, which connects potential criminal suspects to other unsolved crimes in order to speed arrests and close old cases. The algorithm is trained on a decade of historic police data of manually identified crime patterns. Patternizr came into use in 2017 when the NYPD hired one hundred civilian analysts to use it. The algorithm now processes over six hundred reports per week. When prompted about the potential for racism embedded into the algorithm, the NYPD responded that the algorithm does not provide different results than a random sampling of police reports. However critics have expressed skepticism, arguing that historical police reports already demonstrate racial bias. Patternizr was released publicly with the intent that it be used and replicated in other police departments. Live camera feeds are passed through algorithms which detect for suspicious behavior such as unattended bags or entry to restricted areas, and raise these feeds to officer attention via an alert if detected. Since 2011 The NYPD has also used the DAS to perform facial recognition against both adults and juveniles. The DAS privacy statement specifies it does not use facial recognition Response From the initial announcement of the citywide Domain Awareness System in 2012, critics have suggested that the system represents a possible violation of privacy, and should be overseen by a non-police entity. In 2014, Justice Quarterly published an article stating that there was statistical evidence of the NYPD manipulating CompStat data, which is used by the Domain Awareness System for various purposes including predictive policing. A number of organizations, such as the NAACP, have suggested that predictive policing algorithms that rely on machine-learning and historical police data to make decisions reinforce existing police bias, rather than correct for it.

In a racing career which lasted from June 1993 to November 1994 she ran eight times and won two races. As a two-year-old she won on her debut and finished second in the Phoenix Stakes at Leopardstown. On her three-year-old debut, Las Meninas defeated Balanchine to win the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse becoming the first Irish winner since 1975. She went on to finish second in the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh but her subsequent form deteriorated and she finished unplaced in her remaining four races. Las Meninas was retired from racing to become a broodmare at the end of her three- year-old season. Background Las Meninas was a bay filly bred in Ireland by her owner, Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud. She was sired by Glenstal, a son of Northern Dancer who won the National Stakes in 1982 and the Prix Daphnis a year later. Apart from Las Meninas, his best winners included the Premio Parioli winner Candy Glen, and Glen Kate, a mare who won the Hong Kong International Bowl. Las Meninas, who was named after the painting by Velasuez, was sent into training with the former National Hunt jockey Tommy Stack at Golden, County Tipperary. The filly's one eccentricity was her tendency to swish her tail when walking, sometimes regarded as a sign of an unreliable temperament. Racing career Las Meninas made her first appearance in the six furlong Silver Flash Stakes at Leopardstown in June. Ridden by Stephen Craine, she started at odds of 8/1 and won by a length from Danish. After a break of two months, Las Meninas reappeared in the Group One Phoenix Stakes over the same course and distance, in which she was tested against colts including the Norfolk Stakes winner Turtle Island. Ridden by Craine again, Las Meninas was hampered in the early stages but made progress to challenge for the lead in the final furlong, before finishing second to Turtle Island by half a length. When Las Meninas returned in the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course on 28 April 1994 she had been off the course for more than eight months. Stack had struggled to bring the filly to peak fitness because of the unusually wet and cold weather. She started at odds of 12/1 in a field of fifteen fillies in which the main contenders appeared to be the Nell Gwyn Stakes winner Mehthaaf who started favourite, Prophecy, the winner of the previous year's Cheveley Park Stakes and the French-trained Coup de Genie. Among the outsiders was Balanchine, a filly who had been sold by Robert Sangster to Sheikh Mohammed and sent to join the still-experimental Godolphin team in Dubai. Ridden for the first time by John Reid, Las Meninas was restrained in the early stages and appeared unlikely to find a clear run before finding a gap and moving up to challenge the leaders entering the final furlong. The closing stages saw a closely contested race between Las Meninas, Balanchine and Coup de Genie and following a photo-finish (which took the judge twenty minutes to resolve) the Irish filly was declared the winner by a short-head and a neck. After the race, Stack compared the emotional impact of the win to his success on Red Rum in the 1977 Grand National. Three and a half weeks after her Newmarket win, Las Meninas started favourite for the Irish 1,000 Guineas on softer ground at the Curragh. She went into second place inside the final quarter mile but could no further progress and was beaten one and a half lengths by Mehthaaf. In June Las Meninas started favourite for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot but finished fifth of the ten runners. After a break of three and a half months, Las Meninas returned in the autumn, but failed to recapture her earlier form. At Longchamp in October she was unplaced in the Prix du Rond Point and the Prix de la Forêt. She was then sent to California in November where she finished last of the eight runners behind Exchange in the Matriarch Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Las Meninas was then retired from racing. Assessment In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Las Meninas a \\"poor\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Stud record At stud, Las Meninas was sent to leading stallions including Thunder Gulch, Woodman and Royal Academy. She was later sent to Japan where she produced six foals, two by Sunday Silence, at the Shadai Farm before being retired in 2006. She produced some minor winners, but nothing of top class.

The Saints-Pierre, Paul et Quirin cathedral in Malmedy. The short-lived diocese of Eupen-Malmedy is one of three former Belgian dioceses, and the only such see in present Belgium that has not been created a titular see.  History  = Origin = The jurisdiction was established in 1919 as Apostolic Administration of Eupen–Malmedy–Sankt Vith (a normally missionary pre-diocesan type of jurisdiction), on Belgian-occupied German territory split-off canonically from the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Cologne (Köln) and entrusted to Archbishop Sebastiano Nicotra (1919 – 1920.07.30), then apostolic nuncio, the representative of the Holy See, to the Belgium government and the Catholic Church in Belgium. The German areas Eupen and Malmedy were transferred from defeated Axis power Germany to the Allied Kingdom of Belgium in 1920, conforming to the Treaty of Versailles, as part of the hefty compensation (besides huge reparation payments) for the losses the country had suffered during conquest and occupation in World War I. There were difficulties for the population, who now were part of a different country. On the ecclesiastical field these problems were, that the population felt more related to the German Archdiocese of Cologne, than the French-speaking diocese of Liege, which was dependent on the primatial archdiocese of Mechelen, the later archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussel. = Diocese = When the situation escalated, Cardinal Mercier, Primate of Belgium as Metropolitan Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussel, asked Pope Benedict XV to establish a diocese which would encompass the new Belgian territories. On 30 July 1920, the diocese of Eupen-Malmedy was created by elevating the apostolic administration (losing St-Vith in its name) with the publication of the papal bull Ecclesiae Universae. Martin-Hubert Rutten, bishop of the neighboring but francophone Diocese of Liege, was also named bishop of this new diocese, in personal union. He was officially created bishop of Eupen-Malmedy on 13 October 1920, but remained bishop of the far more important bishopric of Liege as well. The Saints-Pierre, Paul et Quirin church of Malmedy became the cathedral episcopal see of the new bishop. On 15 April 1925, the diocese was suppressed and its territory merged into the diocese of Liege, following another papal bull. The three deaneries, Eupen, Malmedy and Sankt-Vith became part of the diocese of Liege. The cathedral in Malmedy would keep the status of cathedral, also after 1925.

Usually there is thrombophlebitis, which is an inflammatory reaction around a thrombosed vein, presenting as a painful induration with redness. SVT itself has limited significance (in terms of direct morbidity and mortality) when compared to a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which occurs deeper in the body at the deep venous system level. However, SVT can lead to serious complications (as well as signal other serious problems, such as genetic mutations that increase one's risk for clotting), and is therefore no longer regarded as a benign condition. If the blood clot is too near the saphenofemoral junction there is a higher risk of pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication. SVT has risk factors similar to those for other thrombotic conditions and can arise from a variety of causes. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms. There are multiple possible treatments, with the goal of providing symptomatic relief and preventing complications. Signs and symptoms SVT is recognized by the presence of pain, warmth, redness, and tenderness over a superficial vein. The SVT may present as a \\"cord-like\\" structure upon palpation. The affected vein may be hard along its entire length. SVTs tend to involve the legs, though they can affect any superficial vein (e.g. those in the arms). =Complications= SVT in the lower extremities can lead to a dangerous complication in which the clot travels to the lungs, called pulmonary embolism (PE). This is because lower limb SVTs can migrate from superficial veins into deeper veins. In a French population, the percent of people with SVTs that also suffered from PEs was 4.7%. In the same population, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was found in 24.6% of people with SVTs. However, because superficial veins lack muscular support, any clots that form are far less likely to be squeezed by muscle contraction, dislodged, and induce a PE. SVTs can recur after they resolve, which is termed \\"migratory thrombophlebitis.\\" Migratory thrombophlebitis is a complication that may be due to more serious disorders, such as cancer and other hypercoagulable states. Causes SVTs of the legs are often due to varicose veins, though most people with varicose veins do not develop SVTs. SVTs of the arms are often due to the placement of intravenous catheters. Many of the risk factors that are associated with SVT are also associated with other thrombotic conditions (e.g. DVT). These risk factors include age, cancer, history of thromboembolism, pregnancy, use of oral contraceptive medications (containing estrogen), hormone replacement therapy, recent surgery, and certain autoimmune diseases (especially Behçet's and Buerger's diseases). Other risk factors include immobilization (stasis) and laparoscopy. Hypercoagulable states due to genetic conditions that increase the risk of clotting may contribute to the development of SVT, such as factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A mutation, and protein C, S, and antithrombin III and factor XII deficiency. Mechanism The mechanism for the development of an SVT depends upon the specific etiology of the SVT. For example, varicose veins and prolonged bed rest both may induce SVTs due to slowing the flow of blood through superficial veins. Diagnosis SVTs may be diagnosed based upon clinical criteria by a healthcare professional. A more specific evaluation can be made by ultrasound. An ultrasound can be useful in situations in which an SVT occurs above the knee and is not associated with a varicose vein, because ultrasounds can detect more serious clots like DVTs. The diagnostic utility of D-dimer testing in the setting of SVTs has yet to be fully established. =Classification= SVTs can be classified as either varicose vein (VV) or non-varicose (NV) associated. NV-SVTs are more likely to be associated with genetic procoagulable states compared to VV-SVTs. SVTs can also be classified by pathophysiology. That is, primary SVTs are characterized by inflammation that is localized to the veins. Secondary SVTs are characterized by systemic inflammatory processes. A subclass of SVTs are septic thrombophlebitis, which are SVTs that occur in the setting of an infection. Treatment The goal of treatment in SVT is to reduce local inflammation and prevent the SVT from extending from its point of origin. Treatment may entail the use of compression, physical activity, medications, or surgical interventions. The optimal treatment for many SVT sites (i.e. upper limbs, neck, abdominal and thoracic walls, and the penis) has not been determined. =Compression= Multiple compression bandages exist. Fixed compression bandages, adhesive short stretch bandages, and graduated elastic compression stockings have all be used in the treatment of SVTs. The benefit of compression stockings is unclear, though they are frequently used. =Physical activity= Inactivity is contraindicated in the aftermath of an SVT. Uninterrupted periods of sitting or standing may cause the SVT to elongate from its point of origin, increasing the risk for complications and clinical worsening. =Medications= Medications used for the treatment of SVT include anticoagulants, NSAIDs (except aspirin), antibiotics, and corticosteroids. Anticoagulants SVTs that occur within the great saphenous vein within 3 cm of the saphenofemoral junction are considered to be equivalent in risk to DVTs. These high risk SVTs are treated identically with therapeutic anticoagulation. Anticoagulation is also used for intermediate risk SVTs that are greater than 3 cm from the saphenofemoral junction or are greater than 4–5 cm in length. Anticoagulation for high risk SVTs includes the use of vitamin K antagonists or novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for 3 months. Anticoagulation for intermediate risk SVTs includes fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days or the use of intermediate to therapeutic dose low molecular weight heparin for 4–6 weeks. NSAIDs NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be used in both oral or topical formulations for the relief of SVT symptoms. The British Committee for Standards in Haematology guidelines recommend the use of NSAIDs for low-risk SVTs (thrombus <4–5 cm in length, no additional risk factors for thromboembolic events). NSAIDs are used for treatment durations of 8–12 days. Other Antibiotics are used in the treatment of septic SVT. Corticosteroids are used for the treatment of SVTs in the setting of vasculitic and autoimmune syndromes. =Surgery= Surgical interventions are used for both symptomatic relief of the SVT as well as for preventing the development of more serious complications (e.g. pulmonary embolism). Surgical interventions include ligation of the saphenofemoral junction, ligation and stripping of the affected veins, and local thrombectomy. Because of the risk of symptomatic pulmonary embolism with surgery itself, surgical interventions are not recommended for the treatment of lower limb SVTs by the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines and the 2012 British Committee for Standards in Haematology guidelines. The use of surgery for the treatment of SVT is controversial. Prognosis SVT is often a mild, self-resolving medical condition. The inflammatory reaction may last up to 2–3 weeks, with possible recanalization of the thrombosed vein occurring in 6–8 weeks. The superficial vein may continue to be hyperpigmented for several months following the initial event. Epidemiology In a French population, SVT occurred in 0.64 per 1000 persons per year. History SVTs have been historically considered to be benign diseases, for which treatment was limited to conservative measures. However, an increased awareness of the potential risks of SVTs developing into more serious complications has prompted more research into the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of SVTs. Research  A Cochrane review recommends that future research investigate the utility of oral, topical, and surgical treatments for preventing the progression of SVTs and the development of thromboembolic complications.

An identical sister, , was made for Trent at the same time. In 1947–48 Duke of Sparta was involved in controversy over alleged treatment of Nigerian stowaways. She was sold to Grimaldi Brothers of Naples, Italy, in 1951, who renamed her Aquila. She was in the Moluccas in eastern Indonesia in April 1958 when a CIA aircraft involved in a covert mission against the Sukarno government bombed and damaged her. She sank a month later. Her wreck off Ambon City is now a popular scuba diving site. Building William Gray & Company built Duke of Sparta in their yard at West Hartlepool on Tees-side. They launched Duke of Sparta in July 1940 and completed her that October. The ship had nine corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of that heating three single-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of . These fed steam at 225 lbf/in2 to a three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine that developed 492 nominal horsepower. The engine was built by the Central Marine Engineering Works, which was part of Wm Gray & Co. The ship's navigation equipment included direction finding apparatus and an echo sounding device Stowaways from Nigeria On 24 or 25 December 1947 Duke of Sparta sailed from Apapa on a voyage via Las Palmas to Kingston upon Hull, England. Before she sailed, five stowaways were found aboard and were handed over to the police. After two days' sailing, when she was off the Gold Coast, two more stowaways were found. Duke of Sparta summoned the assistance of fishing canoes in the vicinity, and the stowaways were transferred to the canoes to be put ashore. Some days later Duke of Sparta called at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. Some days after she left Las Palmas a further five stowaways were found aboard, and these were kept aboard until Duke of Sparta docked at Hull. Early in 1948 a controversy was raised in Nigeria over the treatment of some of Duke of Spartas stowaways. A Mr Eusebius Tunde George of Lagos, Nigeria alleged that six stowaways were found aboard off Gold Coast, that the crew threw them all into the sea, and that only he and one other stowaway survived. Mr George's allegations were widely published in Nigerian newspapers on 13 February 1948 and subsequently repeated in the newspapers of other British colonies. On 28 April 1948 the British Communist MP Willie Gallacher raised Mr George's allegations in the UK House of Commons. The Labour Government's Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Christopher Mayhew MP, replied refuting the allegations in detail. Mayhew's Labour colleague Will Nally MP added that on 17 February the Nigerian Review had published an article headlined \\"Fantastic story about stowaways is proved false\\", that also had refuted Mr George's claims. Bombing At the end of April 1958 Aquila was in ballast and anchored off Ambon City in Indonesia when she was attacked by a black, unmarked Douglas B-26 Invader ostensibly operated by right-wing Permesta rebels. The date is uncertain, either 28 April (according to one source) or 1 or 2 May (according to another). Damaged by a bomb blast, she stayed afloat for a month before sinking on 27 May 1958. In fact, the attack was part of a U.S. CIA covert operation in support of Permesta in North Sulawesi intended to destabilise President Sukarno's Guided Democracy in Indonesia administration. The CIA pilots had orders to target foreign merchant ships in order to drive international trade away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the nation's economy in the belief this would topple the government. The B-26 was flown by former USAF pilot and CIA contractor Allen Pope, who in the same sortie also bombed the Greek merchant ship and the Panamanian . On 18 May the Indonesian Navy and Air Force shot down Pope's aircraft and captured him, after which the US scaled back the CIA operation and in time revised its policy towards Indonesia. Wreck For many years the position of Aquilas wreck was unknown. One source published in 1999 asserted that Pope had sunk her off the port of Donggala, near Palu in Central Sulawesi. This now seems to be incorrect. For some years recreational scuba divers knew the wreck of a cargo ship in Ambon Bay without knowing her name. In October 2009 divers penetrated the mystery wreck's engine room and recovered a maker's plate from one of her water heaters. This gave the maker as a company in West Hartlepool where SS Aquila had been built, which at last gave a clue to the wreck's identity.Aquila is on a slope on the seabed off Ambon, with her stern about below the surface and her bow about below the surface.

Background Jack was born in Alaska in 1951, to Jason and Nancy Ewing. He had a younger sister named Jamie Ewing. Jack married and divorced April Stevens before his arrival in Dallas. Storylines Jack arrived in Dallas to help his cousins, J.R. Ewing and Bobby Ewing, stop Cliff Barnes and Jamie Ewing from splitting up Ewing Oil. (Jamie had turned up in Dallas with a document which stated that Jock Ewing, Jason Ewing and Digger Barnes had equally split the company up between them in the 1930s). He had information that proved Jock bought his partners' shares a while later. For his help, Jack was given 10% shares in Ewing Oil (5% from J.R. and 5% from Bobby). Jack took them to Wally Wyndam, who told them of some documents that were held by Jock's first wife Amanda. During the trial, the documents proved that Jock did in fact own 100% of Ewing Oil. During the 1985–86 \\"Dream Season\\" [Season 9], Jack started spending time at Ewing Oil helping his cousin J.R. out and acting as a go between for J.R. and his new business partner, J.R.'s former sister-in-law Pam Ewing who decided to keep an eye on J.R. by going to work at Ewing Oil when she inherited Bobby's shares of the company for their son Christopher. During this time Jack also briefly dated Jenna Wade who became mentally unstable due to Bobby's death which ended the romantic part of their relationship. However, once Jenna came to terms with Bobby's death and that he actually wanted to remarry his ex-wife Pam, Jack and Jenna decided to remain friends. Also during this time Jack was pursued by Angelica Nero – CEO of Marinos Shipping. Jack had a striking resemblance to her reclusive employer, Dimitri Marinos. Angelica, with the help of Jack's cousin J.R., persuaded him to pose as Dimitri at a conference in Martinique to convince the company's investors that business was running normally. It was believed that Dimitri's absence was due to illnesses but in fact he was already dead. Meanwhile, Jack and Angelica's assistant, Grace, began to fall in love and eventually Grace betrayed her employer by informing Jack that he would be publicly killed when the job was complete. During the conference, Angelica failed to kill Jack but later she got her revenge by planting a bomb in Jack's car to kill him but it accidentally killed Jamie. However, none of these events actually took place as they were written off as a dream that Pam Ewing had. In 1986, Jack's former wife, April Stevens, turned up in Dallas to make a claim to half of his 10% of Ewing Oil. April proved that, during their divorce hearing, the judge granted her half of Jack's future income. However, Jack sold his 10% for one dollar to Jamie and presented April with her half – fifty cents. After Jamie died and her will was left unsigned, Jack testifies in court that he sold his shares to Jamie to spite April so she would not benefit from him. The judge orders that April receive her five percent. After this, Jack leaves Dallas and is not seen again.

April 1957) is a former UN diplomat. He worked at the UN for 25 years, including as a special envoy for Yemen and a special adviser to former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Early life and education Benomar was born in April 1957 in Nador, north of Morocco. At 19, as a political activist known for his peaceful opposition to the government, he was arrested and imprisoned for eight years. \\"I just 'disappeared',\\" he told the New Internationalist in 1986. \\"That night I was tortured from midnight to 5 o'clock in the morning. They used the classical methods: binding the hands and feet of my naked body to an iron bar and whipping the soles of my feet while forcing my head back in a bucket of excrement.\\" After eight months in a secret detention centre in Casablanca, Benomar was finally charged—with conspiracy to overthrow the government, threatening state security, and membership of illegal organisations—and moved to a regular jail. He and other political prisoners went on a hunger strike to demand their right to a fair trial. The trial finally took place. It lasted seven weeks, and at the end, Benomar and his fellow 130 defendants were all found guilty and handed heavy sentences. By this time, Amnesty International had been made aware of the cases, and each of the 130 prisoners was adopted by a regional group. Benomar's group in Sweden wrote to him for two years before he finally received one of their letters. When he and other prisoners went on a 45-day hunger strike, Amnesty sent telegrams and issued appeals on their behalf. \\"It was a great moral support to know that there were people in the other end of the world who were organising all these activities for my release, people who didn't know me but were concerned about human rights,\\" Benomar said. \\"It gave me quite a lot of courage.\\" During his time in prison, Benomar earned a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees from the Sorbonne in Paris. Following Amnesty's efforts and interventions by his professor in Paris, he was released in 1983, re- arrested soon after and then re-released in 1984, but placed under house arrest. Escaping house arrest in 1984, he fled Morocco on a fisherman's boat and flew from Spain to the UK, where he was granted political asylum, Benomar continued his studies at the Sorbonne and completed his doctorate at the University of London. He went on to become a lecturer and research associate in African and Middle Eastern politics at the University of Paris VII, and worked as an Africa specialist for Amnesty International in London. Prior to his UN career, Benomar served as Director of the Human Rights Program for the Carter Center of Emory University where he worked with former US president Jimmy Carter on human rights, mediation and conflict resolution issues. Career at the United Nations In his career at the UN, Benomar worked for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Department of Political Affairs (DPA). His work has largely focused on peacebuilding and governance issues in conflict countries. In 2005 he helped to establish the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission and Peacebuilding Support Office, which he also directed. He has advised on conflict resolution issues in over 30 countries, including Yemen, Afghanistan and Iraq, where in 2004 he served as the Secretary-General's Envoy to support the National Dialogue Conference. The Under Secretary-General has authored numerous publications dealing with governance, rule of law, constitution writing and peace building. He has been described as \\"quintessentially political\\" by the head of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, David Harland, who has worked closely with Benomar. \\"He is not a simple man who is willing to put all of his cards on the table,\\" Harland told the Atlantic Council in 2014. On 9 November 2015, Benomar was appointed as the UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser for Conflict Prevention. In that role he led the UN response to the political crisis in Burundi. =Role in Yemen= In Yemen, Benomar served for four years as the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy. Benomar led the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, where he worked \\"to facilitate the combined efforts of the international community to promote a democratic transition in the country\\". Benomar brokered the country's Transition Agreement in November 2011, facilitated the successful conclusion of the National Dialogue Conference in January 2014, which took 10 months of deliberations, and mediated the Peace and National Partnership Agreement in September 2014. Benomar facilitated a new round of negotiations, in February and March. The talks were close to a conclusion, when on March 25, 2015, the Saudis intervened militarily. Less than a month later, Benomar resigned. In a statement delivered to the press following his final briefing on Yemen to the Security Council, Benomar condemned \\"systematic acts of obstruction\\" and warned against \\"interference and coercion from outside forces\\". \\"I stressed [to the Security Council] that getting the political process back on track and achieving lasting peace and stability in Yemen could only be reached through Yemeni-led peaceful negotiations, where Yemenis could determine their future,\\" he said. Benomar warned that Yemen’s conflict could become an “Iraq-Libya- Syria” scenario if either side pushes for control of the country, prompting the U.N. Security Council to threaten further measures if the hostilities do not end. “It would be an illusion to think that the Houthis could mount an offensive and succeed in taking control of the entire country. It would be equally false to think that President Hadi could assemble sufficient forces to liberate the country from the Houthis. Any side that would want to push the country in either direction would be inviting a protracted conflict in the vein of an Iraq-Libya-Syria combined scenario,” he said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-un-mediator/u-n-says-yemen- conflict-could-become-iraq-libya-syria-scenario-idUSKBN0MI0SG20150322. The statement sparked outrage among the Saudis and their Gulf allies, who poured scorn on Benomar in the Arabic-speaking media.

He established the bank Seyler & Tillemann with his business associate Johann Martin Tillemann, which speculated heavily on currency debasement during the Seven Years' War. The company went spectacularly bankrupt in what was termed a \\"malicious bankruptcy\\" with 3 million Mark Banco, an enormous sum, in debts, but Seyler and Tillemann were able to retain some of their fortunes.Margaret C. Jacob and Catherine Secretan (red.), The Self-Perception of Early Modern Capitalists, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009 Subsequently, Seyler devoted himself completely to the theatre, first as the main financial backer of the Hamburgische Entreprise (the Hamburg National Theatre), collaborating closely with its dramaturge Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, and subsequently as the founder and director of the Seyler theatrical company, becoming \\"the leading patron of German theatre\\" in his lifetime and employing some of Germany's foremost actors, playwrights and composers.

Andreae in Hanover and hardly saw their biological father for the rest of his life. In 1772, Abel Seyler married his long-time mistress Friederike Sophie Seyler (1737/1738–1789), who was alongside Friederike Caroline Neuber Germany's leading actress of the 18th century, and who wrote the Singspiel Hüon und Amande that was a major inspiration for the libretto of the opera The Magic Flute. They had no children. The oldest son of Abel Seyler, Abel Jacob Gerhard Seyler (1756–1805), was court pharmacist in Celle 1791–1803 and also inherited the Andreae & Co. pharmacy with his two siblings as co-heirs, which was sold in 1803. He was married to Karoline Auguste Luise Klügel (1770–1841), a daughter of the noted mathematician and physicist Georg Simon Klügel. Their only son was Georg August Wilhelm Seyler (1800–1866), a doctor of theology and pastor in Annaburg. He was married (1826) to Klara Franziska Hoppe, a daughter of the Freiburg superintendent (bishop) Ernst August Dankegott Hoppe. Georg Seyler became a second father to his wife's orphaned younger siblings, and in 1864 he formally adopted his 25 years younger brother in law, the later noted physiologist and chemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler, who added the Seyler name to his birth name.Ludwig Erdwin Seyler, head and co-owner of Berenberg Bank The second son of Abel Seyler, Ludwig Erdwin Seyler (1758–1836), was married to Anna Henriette Gossler (1771–1836), a member of the Hamburg Hanseatic Berenberg-Gossler banking dynasty, who was the eldest daughter of banker Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg (1749–1822). Elisabeth Berenberg was the only heir of the Flemish-origined Berenberg banking family of grand burghers who established Berenberg Bank in 1590, and her grandfather Rudolf Berenberg had become a senator in 1735. She was also descended from the Welser family. Johann Hinrich Gossler had become owner of the bank by marrying her in 1768, as her father had no male heirs and as the Hamburg branch of the Berenberg family was becoming extinct in the male line. In 1788, Gossler took on Seyler, his son- in-law, as the new partner, and following Gossler's death in 1790, Ludwig Seyler became head of the firm. Ludwig Seyler served, inter alia, as President of the Commerz-Deputation (1817–18), one of Hamburg's three main political bodies, and as a member of the Hamburg Parliament (Erbgesessene Bürgerschaft).

She was the director of the La Monnaie in Brussels from 1724 to 1726. Dujardin is regarded as one of the earliest and most notable French female theatre directors and as a pioneer for colleagues of her gender in that role. Dujardin was part of the choir of the Royal Music Academy of Paris. As part of this choir, she took on small roles in performances such as Iphigénie et Tauride by Antoine Danchet and André Campra (6 May 1704), La Vénitienne by Antoine Houdar de La Motte and Michel de La Barre (16 May 1705), and in a reprisal of Alceste by Philippe Quinault and Jean-Baptiste Lully (25 November 1706). From then on, she also performed larger roles, such as Junon in Sémélé by La Motte and Marin Marais (9 April 1709), and Manto in Manto la Fée by Mennesson and Jean-Baptiste Stuck (29 January 1711). Manto was her last role at l'Opera, which she left to travel to Rouen. During the next year, Dujardin directed a troupe that performed in Brussels and Ghent. The troupe arrived in Rennes in 1718, and travelled further north towards Lille. She joined the troupe of Denis and Garnier, and later took on leadership over this group. This new troupe performed in The Hague and Antwerp between 1721 and 1723, and in Brussels in 1724, where Dujardin became director of La Monnaie from 1725 to 1726. She directed the theater of Metz (1729-1731), and travelled to Avignon (1731), Bayonne (1733), Toulouse and Montauban (1734), and finally to Marseille (1734-1736). In 1735, Dujardin received permission to build a new, open theater hall in the garden of the Hôtel de Ville of Bordeaux. Afterwards, she found herself in Bayonne (1736-1737), Avignon (1738), and Toulouse (1737). She returned to Marseille in 1738. She sang at Bordeaux and Toulouse in 1746. This is the last that is known of her.

He spent most of his life in Łódź and died during the liquidation of the Białystok Ghetto in the Holocaust. Biography Behrman's place of birth is uncertain. He was born either in the town of Tukkum near Mitawa, or in Riga (sources vary), the son of Róża and Markus Behrman, who arrived in Łódź sometime before the end of the century. Adolf studied art under Jakub Kacenbogen at his private Drawing School in Łódź before the 1900s. He continued his studies in Munich in 1900–1904, first privately, then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich under Gabriel von Hackl. His paintings inspired the art critic Zygmunt Bomberg- Batowski to write: \\"Their diverse themes, the depiction - those are always picturesque. This modest artist always thoroughly and lovingly considers any issues brought by a particular theme, in order to best solve the problem of their presentation.\\" Adolf Behrman, Talmud readers A graduate of the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Behrman's first commercial success was the selling of a series of paintings and drawings to an arts' collector in Łódź in 1905 which enabled him to travel to Paris. He lived there, studied at the Academy and worked for the next five years. From 1924 to 1927, Behrman traveled to Palestine, Egypt and later Morocco. His landscapes originating from that period have become the most known part of his work. Behrman's palette became brighter in that period with the introduction of impressionist tones. In the 1930s, he returned to Poland and went to Kazimierz Dolny for the first time. There, he created one of his most important works, Interior of the Synagogue in Kazimierz Dolny. Adolf Behrman, The Jewish Bride (1914) Behrman was a painter of scenes from daily life of the Polish Jews and views of Jewish quarters. His 1914 painting The Jewish Bride was used for the cover of the book The Stories Our Parents Found Too Painful to Tell, originally a memoir written in Yiddish titled The Annihilation of Bialystok Jewry, by Rafael Rajzner and Henry R. Lew. His last major exhibit took place in 1935 in Łódź. After the Nazi German and Soviet invasion of Poland, Behrman escaped to Białystok in the Russian zone of occupation. He was killed in 1943 by the Nazis in the Białystok Ghetto around the time of the perilous Białystok Ghetto Uprising. Many of Behrman's paintings were destroyed in World War II. Some of his paintings can be found at the Historical Museum of Kraków and at the Łódź Museum.

He was listed on the NIA Most Wanted until his arrest on the India-Nepal border near Motihari, Bihar on 28 August 2013.List Questions were raised after his arrest that whether Yasin undertook arms and explosive training in Pakistan or not. He has been sentenced to death by a NIA court in Hyderabad on 19 December 2016. Early life Ahmed Siddibapa was born on 15 January 1983 to Zarar Siddibapa and Rehana. He studied until the 10th grade at Bhatkal, Karnataka. After not being able to clear his 10th-grade examination he left for Dubai in November 2005. According to his family, Ahmed disappeared from Dubai in January 2007. Few years back he married a girl named Zahida at New Delhi. He told her that he was Imran hailing from Lucknow. Since 2010, he was living in the guise of Dr. Shahrukh, a Unani Doctor at Pokhara, Nepal. Militancy Bhatkal is accused of direct involvement in over 10 separate bombings in India. These include the 2008 Delhi bombings and the 2010 Varanasi blasts. He is also suspected to have played an active role in the 2006 Mumbai serial train bombings. =2008 Ahmedabad bombings= According to Ahmedabad Crime Branch, Bhatkal arrived in Ahmedabad in July 2008, where he rented a house in Danilimda along with Asadullah Akhtar alias Haddi. The bombs used to carry out the series of 21 bomb blasts in the city on 26 July 2008 were made in the rented premises. =2010 Bangalore stadium bombing= In 2010, the Karnataka investigators had alleged that the attacks were likely to have been carried out by a jihadist cell led by Karachi based jihadist, Riyaz Ismail Shahbandri's key lieutenant Yasin. Soon after the arrest of several of Sidibapa's alleged associates from Darbhanga, in Bihar police began investigating Fasih Mehmood's possible role in the cell. =2012 Pune bombing= Indian Investigators suspect Yasin, had planted one of the bombs on Jangli Maharaj road on 1 August, when four low-intensity blasts occurred in Pune. Capture and interrogation Yasin was traced and detained at the India-Nepal border in Nepal near Raxaul by a team of undercover Indian police on 28 August 2013. For this reason the name of none of those officers have been made public. He was the second big catch for Indian security agencies after the arrest of Abdul Karim Tunda, a key Lashkar-e-Taiba operative and expert bomb-maker, who was arrested from the India-Nepal border on 16 August. \\"He is presently in the custody of Bihar Police. His interrogation is going on\\", said the Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde at the time. The arrest of Yasin alias Ahmed Siddibappa alias Shahrukh is being seen as a major breakthrough in the agencies' protracted efforts to break the back of the Indian Mujahideen, the Lashkar-e-Taiba-backed indigenous jihadi outfit behind the Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Pune and Jaipur blasts. \\"This is the biggest success after the Batla House operation, following which the IM was forced to slow down its activities,\\" said an intelligence official. The Bollywood movie India’s Most Wanted is based on how the undercover team planned and executed his capture. On 31 August 2013, during initial interrogation, Bhatkal admitted to recruiting young men from Bihar for terror attacks across the country. Yasin Bhatkal admitted his involvement in carrying out the 2011 triple blasts in Mumbai. He admitted to the investigative agency that he was the mastermind behind the blasts and he is satisfied with whatever he has done and had no remorse or regret whatsoever. Bhatkal, and his associate Ashadullah Akhtar, was flown from Delhi to Ahmedabad by a special Border Security Force (BSF) plane on 6 April 2017 for interrogation by the Ahmedabad Crime Branch. Crime Branch had sought a transfer warrant for both men in August 2013, accusing them involvement in the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings. However, Section 268 of the Code of Criminal Procedure under which both were detained, bars the transfer of an accused delaying the transfer. Trial and sentencing The NIA filed two chargesheets against Bhatkal, Zia-ur-Rehman alias Waqas, Asadullah Akhtar alias Haddi, Tahaseen Akhtar and Aijaz Sheikh in 2014. The NIA alleged that \\"Bhatkal, along with other conspirators, developed different modules and sleeper cells in Delhi, Darbhanga in Bihar, Nanded, Mumbai, Pune, Bhatkal in Karnataka and Hyderabad.\\" All five men were put on trial in the NIA court Cherlapally Central Prison. The trial began in August 2015 and concluded on 7 November 2016. During the trial, a total of 158 witnesses were examined, 201 pieces of material evidence were seized, and over 500 documents were produced in court. All five men were found guilty by the court on 13 November. They were convicted under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war against the country) and 121-A (conspiracy to wage war) of the Indian Penal Code, as well as the Arms Act and various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Bhatkal is currently lodged at Tihar Jail in Delhi. Arms training in Pakistan Indian Media claims that Yasin Bhatkal allegedly entered Pakistan in early 2006 on a regular commercial flight from Dubai even though he did not have a visa and was whisked away from the aircraft by his contacts to avoid immigration checks according to Indian media. Yasin was taken to a hilly region with little habitation around, about 8–10 hours from Karachi and believed to be somewhere in the Pakistani province of Balochistan as Indian media's claim stated. \\"Next day our training started. There were six instructors, who I understand were from Pakistan army,\\" he has allegedly said, adding that he and some other recruits were taught to handle weapons and explosives and make bombs during the training that lasted about 50 days. Yasin has told interrogators that he spent about 50 days in Pakistan undergoing training to launch terror attacks and returned to Dubai in the same manner after his hosts stamped his passport with fake immigration stamps to show that he had entered and exited India. Popular culture 2019 Hindi film India's Most Wanted is inspired from his arrest after a long manhunt.

Biography  Artur Fonvizin was born on 11 January 1883 in Riga, Latvia, the son of a German-born forester. =Studies= After finishing high school in 1901, he went to study at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. His early works were signed von Wiesen.Artur V. Fonvizin - three biographies on artru.info (in Russian) His teachers were K. N. Gorski, V. N. Baksheev, and P. I. Klodt.Most sources cite M. P. Klodt as Fonvizin's teacher, but that Klodt lived in St. Petersburg, whereas the school was located in Moscow There he met Mikhail Larionov, the leader of the Union of Youth, ready to \\"subvert the old art.\\" When the Union arranged an exhibition without the permission of the school authorities, he was expelled from the school, along with Mikhail Larionov and Sergei Sudeikin.S. A. Fonvizin (editor): Visible Absence - Exhibition Catalogue of A. V. Fonvizin, Central House of Artists, Moscow. 1998. In 1904, he moved to Munich, where he continued his studies at private art studios. In 1906, he returned to Russia, to live for a time with his parents in their village. =Shows= From 1907 until the Great War, as a member of Larionov's group, Fonvizin was a notable participant in the exhibitions Blue Rose (1907), Stephanos (1909), Union of Youth, the first exhibition of the Jack of Diamonds (December 1910), the exhibitions Target and The Donkey's Tail (1910–12). He participated in the salons of the Golden Fleece and Wreath-Stephanos, and joined the World of Art movement. His works of this period can be characterized as symbolist, in the so-called lyrical primitive style. His most famous works of the time are The Bride (1902), Leda (1904), and Composition with the figure of Christ (1904). When the First World War started, Fonvizin moved to the province of Tambov, where he painted a great deal from nature. In 1918, he headed the art studio at the Proletarian Culture artistic organisation in Tambov. In 1922, he became a member of the creative organization Makovets and participated in its exhibitions. In 1923, he taught at the Art College of Nizhny Novgorod. In 1926, he returned to the Tambov studio of illustrative art. =A World of Watercolors= In 1927, he went to Moscow, where the following year he joined the Society of Artists of Moscow and the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia. At the same time, he moved on to watercolours, his primary medium for the rest of his life. In 1929, he visited Leningrad, where he sketched views of the city; in the early 1930s he travelled to Kerch and Askania-Nova. Other works of those years include illustrations for 1001 Nights (1932), and A German Romantic Tale (1936). His first solo exhibition was held at the Pushkin Museum in 1936.Roman Gretsky, Giddy Autist: Artur Fonvizin at the Museum of Private Collections, «Kultura», № 6 (7365), 13–19 February 2003 (in Russian). In 1937, during a Communist campaign against formalism in art, the Soviet press lumped him with The Gang of Formalists (which comprised The Three F's: Falk, Favorsky, and Fonvizin). From the beginning of the 1940s to his death, the main themes of the artist's works were portraits of theatre actresses in stage costume, sketches of the circus, pictures of pre-revolutionary life, images of flowers, and landscapes.Фонвизин Артур Владимирович, Great Soviet Encyclopedia (in Russian) Fonvizin's distinguishing characteristic is that he painted directly, without the use of preparatory sketches in pencil. =Exiled= In 1943, because of his German descent, Fonvizin was exiled to Kazakhstan. There he began his cycles Karaganda and The Cabmen. From 1958 to 1960, the artist lived in the village of Pirogovo, where he painted landscapes. He continued to exhibit his works after the Second World War. His personal exhibitions were held in the Union of Theatrical Artists of the Russian Federation (1940), Central House of Artistic Workers (1944, 1947), Central House of Litterateurs (1955), in the halls of the Moscow Union of Artists (1958), and at the Union of Artists of the USSR (1969). In 1970, he received the title of Honoured Artist of the Russian Federation. He died on 19 August 1973 in Moscow. Sketches and watercolor portraits of actors and artists, landscapes and still lifes by Fonvizin are kept in the Tretyakov Gallery, the Pushkin Museum, and the State Russian Museum.

Headquartered in France, it operates local agencies and subsidiaries in Spain and Italy. It was founded in 1994. History = Creation and development of the group = The company was founded in 1994 by Alain Taravella and Jacques Nicolet,. The company was initially engaged in the shopping malls development. During the following years, it absorbed several smaller firms in the French property sector : in 1995, Altarea acquired Le Gerec, a company created in 1973 specializing in shopping center construction. Its subsequent rapid growth included winning a competition organized by the town of Le Havre for the construction of Espace Coty. In 1997, Altarea began construction on the Bercy Village shopping center in the 12th arrondissement of Paris, which opened in 2000. The project aimed to revive a historic neighborhood of Paris. In 2001 was established the Italian subsidiary. The Group opened several shopping centers in 2002: Espace Jaurès in Brest, Espace Grand’Rue in Roubaix, Côté Seine in Argenteuil and the Gare du Nord boutiques in Paris. At the same time, Altarea launched its open air retail park activity by creating Compagnie Retail Park, a subsidiary in charge of this sector.http://www.altareacogedim.com/sites/altarea/IMG/pdf/groupe/plaquette_presentation.pdf The Group gradually developed its business activity in different countries of the European Union. It thus extended its activity to Italy in 2001 by creating Altarea Italia. In 2004, Altarea España was created in Spain. Today, it features a major shopping center located in Sant-Cugat, near Barcelona. In 2011, Altarea Cogedim supplemented its various business activities by creating AltaFund, an investment fund dedicated to office property. = Acquisition of Cogedim = In 2007, Altarea purchased Cogedim. Cogedim had been founded in 1963 and whose main activities are the development of housing, offices and hotels. In addition to its housing activity in the major French metropolitan areas, the Group also developed its activity in upmarket commercial real estate and luxury hotels, with the renovation of the Salle Wagram in 2009, the opening of the Marriott Renaissance Arc de Triomphe and the Radisson Blu in Nantes in 2012, and the InterContinental Hôtel Dieu in Marseille in 2013. = Stake in the Rungis International Market = In 2007, the Group acquired 34% of SEMMARIS – a semi-public company that manages the Rungis International Market – by becoming the majority shareholder alongside the state. The Rungis International Market is the world’s largest wholesale food market in terms of volume. = Development of retail and e-commerce activity = Since 2011, Altarea Cogedim has developed its commercial activity by opening several shopping centers in France: Family Village® in Limoges, the Okabé shopping centre and offices in Kremlin-Bicêtre, the acquisition of Cap 3000 in Saint- Laurent-du-Var, near Nice among others. Altarea Cogedim owns 41 shopping centers in France, Italy and Spain. In 2012, it acquired a 96.5% interest in Rueducommerce, an e-commerce company operating through the website rueducommerce.fr.

It is known from the single type species Vigilius wellesi. The holotype specimen of Vigilius is a skull labelled UCMP 36199. The skull was found in an area alongside Arizona State Route 64 overlooking the Grand Canyon. It came from a layer of the Early Triassic Moenkopi Formation. The skull was described by paleontologists Samuel Paul Welles and Richard Estes in 1969 and attributed to a new genus and species of brachyopid called Hadrokkosaurus bradyi. The holotype of Hadrokkosaurus was an isolated lower jaw. In 2000, paleontologists Anne Warren and Claudia Marsicano suggested that the lower jaw and skull represent two different species, as they were found over apart and come from two animals of different size. Warren and Marsicano assigned the skull the a new genus and species Vigilius wellesi. The genus name comes from the Latin word vigilia meaning \\"keeping watch,\\" a reference to its large eye sockets and \\"to the fact that the skull was keeping vigil over the Grand Canyon.\\" The species was named in honor of Welles. Several bones found around the Grand Canyon site were also attributed to Vigilius, including a pterygoid bone that was described in 1971 as a scapulacoracoid. Additional remains were found west of Holbrook, Arizona. Phylogeny The material now assigned to Vigilius was first identified as remains of a brachyopoid. Warren and Marsicano conducted a phylogenetic analysis of many brachyopoids and found Vigilius to nest within the family Brachyopidae. Brachyopoidea is normally divided into the families Brachyopidae and Chigutisauridae, but these families are not always considered closely related; in some studies, Chigutisauridae is placed in a group of mostly Mesozoic temnospondyls called Stereospondyli while Brachyopidae is classified within a group of temnospondyls called Dvinosauria, which includes Carboniferous and Permian taxa that are older than Vigilius. The relationship of dvinosaurians to other temnospondyls is uncertain, as they may or may not belong to Stereospondyli. Warren and Marsicano identified many features in Vigilius that are not seen in other brachyopoids but are common in dvinosaurians, including a narrow vomer bone at the front of the palate and a very wide cultriform process at the front of the parasphenoid, a bone on the underside of the skull. They considered Vigilius to be a dvinosaur in spite of the results of their phylogenetic analysis.

The relationship between these descendants is complicated by three factors: the duplication of names, not only within a family line but across lines; the number of intra-family marriages; and marriages to people with the same surname but not closely related. This list is not exhaustive but includes most family members likely to be found in Wikipedia and Australian newspapers. History Samuel Moss Solomon had a business in London manufacturing pencils, though reports of him being an inventor or even a major manufacturer are unsupportable. He married Elizabeth Moses (c. 1772–c. 1814) and had four sons: Moss Samuel, Emanuel, Vaiben and Phillip, and four daughters: Susan, Hannah, Sarah and Esther. After the death of Elizabeth he married Esther Davis (31 December 1774 – 13 July 1875), with whom he had another two children, Isaac and Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\". Their home was at 30 Wentworth Street, Spitalfields, London. Two sons, Vaiben and Emanuel, fell foul of the law, and were transported to Sydney in 1818 on the Lady Castlereagh as convicts. Fifteen years later Samuel Moss Solomon and his wife Esther and many of their family emigrated to Australia in the Enchantress, arriving in Sydney on 24 April 1833. Sons Moss Samuel Solomon and Isaac Solomon emigrated, also several children of Susan Benjamin, née Solomon, and later Susan herself. Hannah (1801 – 1 September 1849), Sarah (1806 – 14 March 1893) and Phillip (1806 – September 1876) were married and remained in England. Samuel Moss Solomon died in Sydney in 1842. Ten years after the death of her husband, Esther moved to the home of her son Isaac in Adelaide, where she died some 23 years later. Family Samuel Moss Solomon (c. 1769 – 13 May 1842 in Sydney) married Elizabeth Moses (c. 1772–c. 1814). She was the mother of Moss Samuel (1796 – 3? 4? February 1849), Susan (1799 – 14 June 1885), Emanuel (1800 – 3 October 1873), Hannah (1801 – 1 September 1849), Vaiben (1802 – 21 June 1860), Phillip (1806 – September 1876), Sarah (c. 1808 – 14 March 1893), and Esther (1809 – 3 December 1869). He married again, to Esther Davis (31 December 1774 – 13 July 1875), with whom he had another two children: Isaac (5 April 1816 – 27 July 1901) and Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" (14 June 1821 – 9 February 1898). He is reported as emigrating to Sydney with daughters Hannah and Elizabeth in April 1833.E. S. Richards The Fall and Rise of the Brothers Solomon read before the Australian Jewish Historical Society 11 June 1974, pub. in Vol VIII Part II of the Society's magazine, Sydney 1975. Details in this paper that are contradicted by contemporary Family Notices are discounted, specifically that Michael Cashmore was the first mayor of Melbourne (he was the city's first Jewish councillor); that Elizabeth migrated with her father in 1833 (she married Cashmore in England, emigrated with him on Clonmel). It also asserted that Isaac arrived in 1838 and married his step-brother's daughter. This was discounted on the information that he married Isabella Spyer in 1835, however it does appear that Isaac married Isabella, the daughter of his half-brother Moss Samuel at the Sydney synagogue in 1842. The surname \\"Spyer\\" has been attached by some genealogists to Isabella. If she were an adopted daughter that would remove the consanguinity problem Ten years after the death of her husband, Esther moved to the home of her son Isaac in Adelaide, where she died some 23 years later. =Moss Samuel= Moss Samuel Solomon (1796 – 3? 4?

Cukier's village depictions were mostly executed in graphics, for which she is best known, especially her stylistic color woodcuts. She also painted in oil and pastel, but there she dealt with her subjects in a more realistic style. Cukier studied painting at a private school run by Konrad Krzyżanowski, and since 1923 she continued her studies at the School for Fine arts in Warsaw, in Mieczysław Kotarbiński and Tadeusz Pruszkowski's classes. She also studied graphics at Edmund Czerwienski's studio. During those years she also frequented open air workshops in the Kazimierz Dolny art colony. She also visited the Krzemieniec art colony, located in the Wolyn region. Her landscapes with views of Kazimierz Dolny, Wiśniów, and Puck dominated her output and became popular, with some translated to woodcuts. Her work was exhibited in Warsaw in 1938 at the Art Promotion Institute. Some of her work had survived and is in demand partly for its rarity and partly for it charm. However, the great majority of her work was destroyed during World War II as was the case for many artists.

No convincing field data were ever collected from 19th century weavers or traditional owners about the iconography. Since then, there has been great loss of Lampung traditional knowledge. The history of these ships cloth is obscure and the reasons for both their original use and their decline remain conjectural. . The factors that are presumed to have caused this include the abolition of slavery in 1859, the decline in the pepper trade and changing marriage traditions. Two lesser known forms are the tatibin and the tampan maju. The tatibin are similar in design to the single ship palepai but are smaller, not exceeding 1.5 M. The tampan maju beaded and also shorter than the large cloths. Only 12 examples of tampan maju are known to exist. Design elements Palepai Maju. The Metropolitan Museum of Art No two Palepai are identical, however their designs fall into four main groups. #A large ship stretching the entire length of the cloth as is seen in the image above. #Two large red ships, an example of which can be seen in the Textile Arts Collection. #Two or three rows of stylized human figures extending along the length of the cloth, an example of which is in the art collection of the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. #Four or more discrete panels. These panels are usually of the same composition, an example of which is in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. As little is known about the meaning of the design elements of the ships cloth we have to conjecture from ethnographic parallels. Uses The use of palepai is the prerogative of those of the penyimbang rank in the complex social structure of the Paminggir people. These textiles are used at many ceremonies of the life cycle. In ceremonies the palepai was hung on the right wall of an inner room of the house as a backdrop for the central figure in the rite. In the marriage ceremony this is the bride who sits in front of the cloth of her husband-to be, after arriving in an elaborately bedecked procession. On the bride's first visit home after the wedding ceremony the cloth may have been hung. And then again, shortly after the birth when the first child is presented to the maternal grandparents to receive a name. The cloth is also hung at the celebration of a boy's circumcision and at funerals. For the Paminggir nobility the presence of the large palepai was also essential at ceremonies pronouncing the rank of the owner.Maxwell, Robyn (1990). Textiles of Southeast Asia, Transition, Trade and Transformation. Australia: Oxford University Press. p. 113. . Technical features The designs are executed by a continuous and discontinuous supplementary wefts on a plain cotton weave foundation. A supplementary weave weft is an additional weft element inserted between two of the regular foundation wefts. The major dyes used were most probably the same as those used in the manufacture of women's sarongs in the area. Sepang (Caesalpinia sappan) and tamarind for the red, turmeric and tamarind for the yellow, and indigo and lime for the blue.Hille 1894. p. 178 The complexity of the organization of any one cloth is enormous, and even though we can only guess at the technicalities involved, if the reader needs more information this is available online. Rarity These cloths have not been woven in a century and few exemplars can be found today.Rajagopalan, Sudha (2002). Navigating Culture: Trade and Transformation in the Island State.

The show was about the life of five coloured teddy bears and their dog Fred. The show was filmed by Meridian Broadcasting. Journalists have compared Teddybears as being similar to and a rival of Teletubbies which was also produced around that time. However the series was targeted at older children. History Teddybears is based on Susanna Gretz and Alison Sage's teddy bear books, the first of which was published almost 30 years before the TV programme's creation. Teddybears inaugural season began on 5 January 1998. A 1999 article in the Bristol Post said Teddybears \\"have become a huge hit with young viewers\\", having captured 64% of the target audience. Link Licensing, a United News & Media spinoff, began making toys, books, and other merchandising several months before the programme's debut. Rights and merchandising company ProVen Private Equity has from Link Licensing the rights to make Teddybears products. In 2000, Link Licensing sold the rights to Teddybears to the TV network Trio which bought 26 episodes. Comparison with Teletubbies The producers of Teddybears asserted that Teddybears is not an immediate rival of Teletubbies; the Daily Record and The Sun consider it a rival. The Daily Record noted that the two TV series have several parallels. Whereas the Teddybears eat \\"hot cross buns, honey, pancakes, jelly and ice cream\\", the Teletubbies eat \\"tubby toast and tubby custard\\". The Teddybears sing The Teddybear Song while the Teletubbies sing Teletubbies say \\"Eh-oh!\\". A difference between the two TV series is that Teddybearss intended audience is older children. The shows' similarities sparked \\"intense\\" coverage by the media. Newspapers and TV shows requested interviews with the teddybears, who all appeared on Richard and Judy's This Morning.  Characters  The five teddybears in the series are William, Sarah, Louise, Robert, and Charles. They wear \\"brightly-coloured furry suits\\" and live at No. 8 Green Street, Bearbridge. According to actress Louise Conran, who played Sarah, she had to \\"wear a lycra body suit, padding on top of that and then the costumes which are about half an inch thick\\". Since the teddybear masks were fastened to their faces with glue, the teddybear actors had to keep the masks on the entire day, even when eating dinner. From the second series the costumes were changed because of this. The actors are adults but play child-sized bears on a set in which everything they interact with is oversized. * Robert, the youngest of the bears, yellow. Often seen with his best friend, a toy frog called Phillip. * Louise, green. The cheekiest of all the bears. * Charles, black. The oldest of the bears, wise but very stubborn. * William, red. Loves to cook. * Sarah, orange. Plays the mother role. Stokenchurch actress Louise Conran played the role. She heard of the role while she was a maid on the BBC adaption of The Children of the New Forest from the TV film's assistant director who was a friend of Kate Marlow, Teddybears producer. * Fred, the Dalmatian Puppeteers Cheryl Blaize, Louise Conran, Tim Hulse, James O' Donnell, Carl Matthewman, John Tobias, Sarah Jane Honeywell, Rae Grant, Grant Mason, Simon Snellings, Kathy Ryan, Rebecca Clow, and Lee Crowley all worked on the series.

A specimen consisting of a partial skull and several vertebrae was named Varanus amnhophilis in 2012 and placed in its own subgenus, Varaneades, but a 2018 study found it to be a junior synonym of Varanus marathonensis. Comparisons with other species of monitor lizards put its size between in length. The fossil was found in the Turolian-age Mytilini Formation on the island of Samos and is currently housed in the American Museum of Natural History. Discovery and naming Skull elements Varanus marathonensis is known from several specimens. One specimen from Cerro de los Batallones, Spain, is currently the most complete fossil of any Varanus species yet discovered. The specimen \\"V. amnhophilis\\" is known from several bone fragments, including the right side of the braincase, a right quadrate bone, part of the palate and skull roof, the right coronoid process and glenoid region of the lower jaw, a piece of the clavicle, and five vertebrae. These bones were found by American paleontologist Barnum Brown, who stored it in the mammal collections of the American Museum of Natural History. The specimen was not identified as a reptile until 2009. Mammal paleontologist Nikos Solounias, who has worked extensively on Samos Island fossils, then brought the fossil to the attention of Carl Mehling. Mehling removed the specimen from the fossil mammal collection and cataloged it as AMNH FR (fossil reptile) 30630. The specimen was described in 2012 as a new species of Varanus, and was placed in a new subgenus called Varaneades. The species name amnhophilis means \\"lover of lamb\\", from the Greek αμνόζ (amnhos, \\"lamb\\") and φιλiζ (philis, \\"a lover of\\"), as a reference to the diet of the largest living monitor lizards, which often includes sheep-sized (and larger) mammals. The subgenus name Varaneades comes from the genus name Varanus and the Neades, mythical nymphs from Samos. A subsequent study in 2018, however, found V. amnhophilis to be a junior synonym of V. marathonensis. Description =Size= The body length of AMNH FR 30630 was estimated by comparing the length of the braincase and an individual vertebra with their lengths in living species of monitor lizards. The ratios of braincase length to postcranial length and dorsal (back) vertebra length to postcranial length are very similar for many monitor species, and were used to estimate the postcranial length of V. amnhophilis. The first ratio gave an estimated postcranial length of about and the second gave a length of about .

The three brothers learned their iron-working skills from their father. The companies' products are often referred to as \\"Meskers.\\" The companies also produced tin ceilings, iron railings, stairs, roof cresting, ventilation grates, iron awnings, skylights, and freight elevators. The Meskers marketed their products through catalogs displaying their designs. The catalogs were so successful they expanded print runs from 50,000 to 500,000 one year later.

On 4 September 2012 her body was discovered in the woods, from the site of her disappearance. A 37-year-old male, later identified as Chris Kenneth Giske, and a 64-year-old male were arrested on charges of murder, and accessory to murder. The 64-year-old, who had been cooperating with the police, was released from custody in early November. On his release, the Attorney Investigator, Cecilie Gulnes, stated: \\"The evidence in the case has not been strengthened against the 64-year-old. We have not received any test results linking the 64-year-old to Sigrid or to the homicide.\\" In October 2013, Chris Giske was sentenced to compulsory psychiatric care for the murder after being found to suffer from psychosis as well as paranoid schizophrenia. Disappearance On Saturday 4 August 2012, Giskegjerde Schjetne attended a Norway Cup soccer game with a group of friends, supporting the Skeid Fotball team. At around 19:45, she was spotted by CCTV on a bus at Tveita, heading home. She ate dinner with her family before leaving to visit another friend. Giskegjerde Schjetne started walking home from her friend's home just before midnight, which was her curfew. The walk should have taken her half an hour. When she did not arrive well after this time, the family notified the police. Approximately an hour later, two boys walking through a local kindergarten found Giskegjerde Schjetne's shoes, socks and iPhone, which her friends and family were calling repeatedly. The boys were asked to deliver the items to Giskegjerde Schjetne's parents who lived nearby, which they did. Her parents had searched the same kindergarten earlier, at around 00:30. According to them, none of the items were present at that time, which would later lead to speculation that they may have been planted there in the interval between the search and their discovery. Several neighbours of the site described having heard loud, frantic female screams coming from the area during the night. One neighbour reported observing a car driving at high speed toward the kindergarten immediately prior to hearing the screams. Other witnesses described seeing a mysterious car parked with headlights lit outside the kindergarten on Saturday night. Despite repeated public requests by authorities, no driver came forward. Search and investigation =Initial search= Searches for Giskegjerde Schjetne began immediately after her disappearance. Hundreds of volunteers from all over the Oslo area congregated in a massive search operation. The family experienced early requests from people who wanted to show support by offering large rewards; one individual offered NOK 500,000 (84,000 US dollars). After conferring with police, the family declined the offers, but they later accepted, and the reward eventually stood at over 950,000 NOK (US $160,000). Volunteers, along with police units, canvassed the neighbourhood and local parks, while search-and-rescue divers from the fire department searched Lake Østensjø, which is near the site of her disappearance. The search expanded over time to include the forested woodlands adjacent to Oslo, including Østmarka and Nordmarka. A record number of volunteers and search-and-rescue personnel descended upon the area, aided by police helicopters with heat-seeking technology and search dogs. The Norwegian Red Cross came with 40 canine units, which searched 24 hours a day and covered more than 1300 square kilometres, guided by GPS mapping. Several well-known self-proclaimed psychics tried to locate the missing girl. Apart from a white sock which was later determined not to match, and despite the most extensive missing-person search operation in recent Norwegian history, no trace of Giskegjerde Schjetne was found. During the first few days after the disappearance, the Oslo police received almost two thousand leads from the public. They sifted through over 13 hours of surveillance tapes without significant results. On Monday August 6, Norwegian police issued an international alert for Giskegjerde Schjetne, and the case was transferred to the Section for Violent and Sexual Crimes. Expert analysts from the National Investigation Service and the Police Security Service were engaged to assist with examining Giskegjerde Schjetne's internet and social media history. The main theory at that time was that Giskegjerde Schjetne had been abducted by a person in a car against her will, and that the perpetrator may have used her mobile phone before leaving it at the scene in order to mislead authorities. Seven days after Schjentne's disappearance, on August 11, her family made an emotional appeal to the perpetrator through the media, calling for her release. Around the same time, it was announced, that prominent lawyer Harald Stabell would be formally appointed to assist the family. On 16 August, twelve days after Giskegjerde Schjetne's disappearance, the partly decomposed remains of a woman were discovered in a private garden area in Ski, a suburb about 30 minutes from downtown Oslo. After speculation, the police announced that it was the body of another person unrelated to the case. On 22 August, Oslo police announced that they were specifically looking for the driver of a burgundy vehicle that was observed in the area of the disappearance. Police also said they were checking named car-owners; plain clothed police detectives went door-to-door, photographing cars as well as interviewing people in the neighbourhood. More than a hundred addresses were visited in hopes of getting new information. Almost four weeks into the investigation, police charged a convicted rapist from Giskegjerde Schjetne's community with making false statements to the investigators. The man's lawyer, Kim Gerdts, claimed the police had used illegal coercion. Police stated that although he was suspected of lying to the police regarding alleged witness observations, he was not a suspect in the murder case. =Possible serial offenders= Police stated that they were investigating a possible connection between Giskegjerde Schjetne's disappearance and an unnamed serial sex offender who had been linked through DNA evidence to three cases of sexual assault, rape and indecent exposure to minors, all of which happened in the area from which Giskegjerde Schjetne vanished. Police conducted voluntary DNA testing of people who lived close to the crime scenes without making a connection to the offender. The area where Giskegjerde Schjetne's body was eventually found, Sofiemyr in Oppegård, is close to the place where two other young women were found murdered after being kidnapped from Oslo during the 1980s. This led to speculation that a serial killer had begun killing again after a 25-year hiatus. =Discovery and arrests= On 4 September 2012 police announced that Giskegjerde Schjetne's body had been found in Sofiemyr (Kolbotn), about 20 minutes from the place where she had disappeared. The body was in a state of decomposition, wrapped up in several layers of plastic and clothing, partly concealed in a wooded, hilly terrain, and adjacent to an industrial area with many derelict buildings. The post mortem, and subsequent forensic report revealed that she had suffered massive head trauma, but ruled out sexual assault or molestation. At the same time, media reported that two men had been arrested during a raid at a nearby warehouse in connection with the case. The arrests were made by the police tactical unit Delta in an operation set up after receiving a lead from a member of the public. The two men, Chris Kenneth Giske, aged 37, and his unidentified colleague, aged 64, were charged with murder and being an accessory to murder. The 64-year-old had no prior criminal record, but Giske had multiple previous convictions for violent crimes, among them an unprovoked assault on a young woman with a crowbar in 2007. The young woman, who barely survived the attack, suffered a fractured skull, a crush fracture of the head, and a 7-cm cut to the face. Court-appointed psychiatrists, observing Giske at the time, stated that he had anti-social personality disorder, an emotional, unstable personality disorder, and panic disorder. The lawyer for the victim characterized the case as \\"one of the worst cases I've seen that has not ended in murder\\". The 23-page psychiatric report from the trial revealed that Giske had suffered from audible hallucinations for over a decade. According to the report, \\"the voices in his head had commanded him to go out and kill, or physically assault, random people.\\" Both men initially denied having anything to do with Giskegjerde Schjetne's disappearance and murder. In October 2012, the final post mortem report was submitted to police by the forensic pathologist. It concluded that the precise cause of death could not be determined, nor the exact time of death. It could, however, establish several facts, for example, that Giskegjerde Schjetne had suffered massive blunt force trauma to the head, chest and abdominal region, and that many of Giskegjerde Schjetne's injuries were inflicted after her death. On 30 October, the 64-year-old suspect was released. The police stated that although they were no longer keeping him in custody, they were not dropping the charges against him. At the same time, a court ordered Giske to be held in isolation for an additional four weeks. About a month later, court-appointed psychiatrists who were to evaluate Giske's mental status requested that he be transferred to Dikemark Hospital and be put under 24-hour observation. On 9 July 2013, 11 months after Giskegjerde Schjetne disappeared, the prosecution formally charged Giske with second-degree murder () and kidnapping. Because the court psychiatrists could not definitely determine his mental status, the prosecution sought compulsory psychiatric care for the defendant, instead of normal prison time.  Trial  The trial opened at Oslo District Court on 16 September 2013, with the Judge Ingemar Nestor Nielsen presiding. Giske was represented by defence attorneys John Christian Elden and Ida Andenæs. He denied the charge of murder and claimed that he was criminally sane and competent, something that the prosecution disagreed with. The defendant was not formally required to enter a plea, since the lead prosecutor, Nina Margoth Prebe decided not to seek compulsory psychiatric care rather than an ordinary custodial sentence. When cross-examined by the assistant prosecutor Jens Olav Sæther, the defendant made a series of claims which were described as \\"bizarre\\". He claimed to be in possession of a mirror with apparent magical powers, for example the ability to grant physical protection from enemies or to compel an individual to \\"confess\\" bad deeds. He claimed that he had been stalked and harassed in his home-town of Ålesund by groups of local children who were under the direct influence of a prison inmate in Oslo. He said he had received violent threats from members of a child pornography ring. When asked about his psychiatric evaluation, he claimed that the expert neuropsychiatrist who examined him, and concluded that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, was in fact working as a belly dancer in his old neighborhood.  Verdict  Giske was sentenced to compulsory psychiatric care for the murder of Giskegjerde Schjetne on 25 October. The court ruled in favour of the prosecution on all counts. The court ruled that while Giskegjerde Schjetne was walking home that on the evening of 4 August, Giske had first struck Giskegjerde Schjetne with his car, seriously injuring her. He then kidnapped her and drove her to his mechanical workshop in Bryn. He placed her in his trailer home, which was parked inside an derelict barn. The court ruled that Giskegjerde Schjetne was still alive when she arrived at the trailer, and that some time later she was killed by blunt force trauma to the head, causing massive bleeding. The court came to this conclusion after hearing the analysis of a bloody mattress which was found inside the trailer. It further ruled that Giske had decided to kill Giskegjerde Schjetne in order to conceal the kidnapping. After killing her, he wrapped her body in plastic covering before dumping her in the woods next to the workshop. Giske appealed the sentence, denying the charges, as well as denying that he was mentally ill. Giskegjerde Schjetne's parents appealed the amount of financial compensation they had been awarded by the court (NOK 20,000 each). On 16 July 2014 the Norwegian High Court dismissed Giske's appeal, thus exhausting his appeals process.  Reaction  In the aftermath of the disappearance there was an outpouring of sympathy, particularly in the local community, and thousands of people contacted authorities with a desire to help. Among the people who showed their support were a friend of the Giskegjerde Schjetne family who acted as a volunteer coordinator and spokesman for them, the crime author Gunnar Staalesen, players from the local football club Vålerenga who participated in the search, and Minister of Education Kristin Halvorsen who mobilised her department to support the family. Giskegjerde Schjetne's funeral service was held on September 19 in Oppsal Church. It drew a crowd of around 700 people, including many notable people such as Minister Halvorsen, and Martin Halla, who sang a tribute song. Officiating at the service was Sturla Stålsett, the son of the former bishop of Oslo Gunnar Stålsett. Her remains were interred at Alfaset Cemetery in the Alna borough. Five weeks after Giskegjerde Schjetne's disappearance, and nearly a week after she was found dead, thousands of residents of Østensjø filled the one-kilometre route Giskegjerde Schjetne was walking when she was abducted with candles and torches, in a bid to reclaim the neighbourhood. This \\"demonstration of light\\" was intended to re-assert a feeling of safety on the streets of the neighbourhood. The case had a strong impact on the neighbourhood, the city and the entire nation. Teenagers reported that they no longer felt safe in their communities. Polls showed that over half the country's parents were more afraid for their children than before. In addition, an increased number of women said they felt unsafe being outside after dark.

A transfer switcher was a type of railroad locomotive specifically designed to perform \\"transfer\\" work in which freight cars are transported between two freight yards in a large terminal area. Design As transfer work required high pulling power but not much speed, the general design of a transfer locomotive consisted of two engines with high-horsepower on an elongated locomotive frame, gearing designed for low speeds, and several driving axles, but were generally built without dynamic braking or multiple unit capability. In addition to the \\"center cab\\" design, transfer locomotives were also built in the form of road switchers and drawbar-coupled cow and calf switcher sets. =Center cab= The \\"center cab\\" configuration is probably the best remembered transfer locomotive design, as the majority of these locomotives were built for transfer work. The first of the \\"center cab\\" locomotives was simply designated the T, and was a one-of-a-kind locomotive, built as a collaboration by the Electro Motive Corporation, St. Louis Car Company and General Electric for the Illinois Central Railroad in 1936. Production Baldwin Locomotive Works and Lima-Hamilton (which would later merge to become Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton) produced the majority of these units, with the former producing 70 Baldwin DT-6-6-2000/Baldwin RT-624 locomotives, and the latter producing 22 Lima LT-2500 locomotives between 1946 and 1954.

A performance lasts about 8½ minutes. History The Rotary Quintet was composed in September 1997 on a commission from Henrik Rolf Hanstein, President of the Rotary Club of Cologne-Römerturm, on the occasion of the club's 25th anniversary. It was first performed by musikFabrik (Helen Bledsoe, flute, Peter Veale, oboe, Nina Janßen, clarinet, Jan Babinec, horn, and Alban Wesley, bassoon) on 25 October 1997 at a meeting of the club held at the Schloss Dyck in Jüchen in the Rhein-Kreis Neuss . The premiere was sprung by Hanstein as a surprise on the 200 or so club members, who had gathered for a banquet and were already seated when it was announced that, before any food or drinks would be served, a work by Stockhausen composed for the occasion would be performed. The captive audience, few of whom would have attended a Stockhausen concert voluntarily, were pleasantly surprised and gave the piece a standing ovation. Stockhausen then gave a brief explanation about the composition which was played a second time, and once more received in the same fashion . Analysis Like the Helicopter String Quartet, The Rotary Wind Quintet is a component of the opera Mittwoch aus Licht . It is an adaptation of the concluding part of the \\"carousel\\" section of scene 4, Michaelion, for choir, four instrumental soloists, and bass singer. In the opera, this subsection is a vocal \\"spatial sextet\\" titled \\"Menschen hört\\", and is also the conclusion of the Bassetsu Trio (for trumpet, basset horn, and trombone), which is a module of three melodic strands in the fabric of the carousel section. These strands consist of the three-layered super-formula of Licht, and are rotated vertically four times. At each change of the layers, the musicians also rotate their positions in the performance space (; ). The work is divided into four phases, connected by sustained chords during which the performers change positions in the hall. Each phase presents a different vertical disposition of the three strands of the Licht super-formula. In phase 1, the Michael formula is in the upper voice, the Lucifer formula in the lowest voice, and the Eve formula in between. In phase 2, the Lucifer formula moves to the top, Michael is in the middle, and Eve below. In phase 3, the Eve formula is uppermost, Lucifer in the middle, and Michael below. In phase 4, the three formulas return to their starting positions . Each phase is a longer and more elaborate version of the formula than its predecessor. The formula closes on a C dominant-seventh chord, and the rotations cause the four phases to cadence on this chord first in root position, then in 4/2 inversion, 6/5 inversion, and finally in root position again .

Slosberg ran for state Senate twice: In 2006, when he lost a bid to the state Senate in the Democratic primary, and in 2016, when he again lost a bid to the state Senate in the Democratic primary, only earning 32% of the vote. He represented the 89th District from 2000 to 2002 and the 90th District from 2002 to 2006 and from 2010 to 2012. Slosberg returned to run for the State seante again, this time for distrcit 29 being vacated by Kevin Rader, Slosberg lost to incumbent representative Tina Polsky in the primary. History Slosberg was born in Chicago, Illinois and attended Roosevelt University there, where he graduated with a degree in business administration in 1970. After graduating, he started the Slosberg Report from Israel, a journalism program. He moved to the state of Florida in 1979. Florida Senate Slosberg ran for the Florida Senate in 2016. He lost to incumbent Jeff Clemens in the Democratic primary after spending $1.9 million of his own money on the race. After Clemens resigned following an extramarital affair with a lobbyist coming to light, Slosberg entered the special election race to fill the now-vacant District 31 seat and is running against Democrat Lori Berman in the primary. Florida House of Representatives In 2000, Slosberg challenged one-term incumbent State Representative Curt Levine in the Democratic primary in the 89th District, which included parts of Palm Beach County, along with Bobra Bush and Marc Shepard. In the end, Slosberg narrowly edged out Levine, winning 39% of the vote and coming in first over Levine by a mere 38 votes out of over ten thousand cast. However, because no candidate received a majority of the vote, a runoff primary election was held. In another closely fought election, Slosberg defeated Levine, receiving 50.5% of the vote and winning by 82 votes. He was elected in the general election without opposition. Following the 2000 census, legislative districts were redrawn, and Slosberg ran for a second term in the 90th District, which included most of the territory he previously represented, but added some parts of northern Broward County. He was renominated by his party, and in the general election, faced only Libertarian candidate Susan Lipschutz, whom he defeated in a landslide, winning 84% of the vote. Slosberg was re-elected without opposition in 2004. When incumbent Democratic State Senator Ron Klein opted to run for Congress against Congressman Clay Shaw in 2006, Slosberg ran in the primary to succeed him rather than seeking re-election to his House seat. However, Slosberg was defeated in the primary by Ted Deutch, who would later go on to win the general election in a landslide, despite spending $2.9 million of his own money on the race. Slosberg's successor in the House, fellow Democrat Kelly Skidmore, declined to seek a third term in 2010, instead opting to run for the Florida Senate against Republican Ellyn Setnor Bogdanoff, so Slosberg ran to succeed his successor. He won the nomination of the Democratic Party easily, defeating Sheldon Klasfeld. In the general election, he defeated Alison Rampersad, the Republican nominee, winning 64% of the vote to once again return to the legislature. In 2012, the Florida House districts were redrawn once again, and Slosberg opted to run for re-election in the 91st District, which removed the sections of Broward County in exchange for a deeper incursion into Palm Beach County. He was elected without opposition both in the primary and the general election. He was re-elected to his third consecutive term in the legislature, and sixth overall, in 2014 without opposition.  Legislation  While in the legislature, Slosberg sponsored legislation that would \\"restrict drivers of commercial motor vehicles traveling interstate highways from talking or texting on hand-held phones while driving,\\" and opposed legislation that would expand virtual education programs in Florida public schools, noting, \\"I don't think this is about embracing technology. I think this is about embracing money. It's not going to benefit our children. It's probably going to benefit for-profit companies and out-of-state schemers.\\" In 2019 Florida Virtual School's former General Counsel Frank Kruppenbacher resigned amid accusations of improper behavior and spending. Gov. Ron DeSantis and lawmakers then ordered a state takeover of Florida’s public online school.https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-ne-florida-virtual-school- audit-released-20191101-ihzqjxshrzeo3jpkqbkzgvfumi- story.html?int=lat_digitaladshouse_bx-modal_acquisition- subscriber_ngux_display-ad-interstitial_bx-bonus-story_______ Slosberg also voted in line with legislation in 2011 and 2014 containing pro-gun language, and in favor of the Republican redistricting plan in 2002 that increased GOP control of the House. Voting Machine Controversy Immediately after the 2000 election in which Slosberg was elected to the Florida State House by 88 votes and at the peak of the vote recount during the Bush-Gore United States presidential election in Florida, 2000, Palm Beach Sheriff's Deputies confiscated a Votamatic voting machine from Slosberg. When initially approached by the Supervisor of Elections Office and asked about the voting machine, Slosberg denied having it. On November 11, 2000, police confronted Slosberg about the voting machine which Slosberg then retrieved from his car and delivered to the police. No reason was ever provided for Slosberg having possession of the voting machine, and despite additional allegations of misconduct Democrat Supervisor of Elections Theresa Lepore neither investigated nor pressed charges against Slosberg. The Dori Slosberg Foundation The Dori Slosberg Highway Safety Foundation is a non- governmental, not for profit, 501(c)3 public service organization dedicated to traffic safety. The foundation is named in memory of the daughter of Irving Slosberg, who was killed in a car crashhttp://www.dorislosberg.org/mission.php. The Dori Slosberg Foundation has been instrumental in promoting highway safety in Florida though programs including Staying Alive on 95 and Survive the Drive http://bocanews.com/archives/BocaNews06-23-08.pdf. It was led by Emily Slosberg. In 2009 the Dori Slosberg Foundation helped pass the Dori Slosberg and Katie Marchetti Safety Belt Law, which gives police the authority to pull over drivers solely for not wearing a seatbelt.http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2009/06/30/0630seatbelt.html References External links *Florida House of Representatives - Irving Slosberg Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Jewish American state legislators in Florida Category:Members of the Florida House of Representatives Category:Politicians from Chicago Category:People from Boca Raton, Florida ","title":"Irving Slosberg"},{"id":"36690379","text":"John Herriott (October 20, 1844 – September 24, 1918) was an American politician and lawyer who served as a Lieutenant Governor from Iowa.

He is best known for his role in exposing Lance Armstrong's massive doping operation. Life and career A native of Jacksonville, Florida, he attended the Bolles School, He starred on the baseball and basketball teams; on the former, one of his teammates was future Atlanta Braves star Chipper Jones. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and in 2010 received the University's Distinguished Young Alumni Award. Tygart went on to get his J.D. from Southern Methodist University in 1999, graduating Order of the Coif. Prior to joining USADA, Tygart was an athlete and associate in the sports law practice at Holme Roberts & Owen LLP (HRO). While at HRO, Tygart worked with individual athletes and the United States Olympic Committee, USA Basketball, USA Swimming, USA Volleyball, and the Pro Rodeo Cowboys' Association. Tygart is on the board of advisors of the Taylor Hooton Foundation. Tygart became Chief Executive Officer of USADA in September 2007. He originally joined the agency in October 2002 as director of legal affairs, later becoming senior managing director and general counsel. He has also prosecuted cases before the American Arbitration Association and the Court of Arbitration for Sport on behalf of USADA. Role in Armstrong doping case Tygart had harbored suspicions about Armstrong for most of his tenure at USADA. A number of former members of Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team had been caught doping. Having learned about the doping that then ran rampant in the sport, Tygart found it hard to believe that Armstrong was clean. In June 2012, USADA accused Armstrong of doping, a charge that Armstrong ceased trying to defend in August 2012. As a result, he was stripped of all results from August 1, 1998 onward–including his seven consecutive Tour titles–and banned for life from all sports whose federations followed the World Anti-Doping Code. The latter sanction had the effect of ending his competitive career. Armstrong filed a suit in U.S. District Court against Tygart and USADA. When dismissing the lawsuit against 'Defendant Travis Tygart and United States Anti-Doping Agency (collectively, \\"USADA\\")', U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks wrote, \\"USADA's conduct raises serious questions about whether its real interest in charging Armstrong is to combat doping, or if it is acting according to less noble motives.\\" Tygart was previously involved in the investigation of Floyd Landis. Tygart stated in an interview with French newspaper L'Équipe that he had received three death threats since the beginning of the Armstrong investigation and that security had been tightened around him by the FBI. After USADA announced that it would strip Armstrong of all his results obtained after August 1, 1998, Tygart stated in an interview with VeloNation: \\"He [Armstrong] knows all the evidence as well and he knows the truth, and so the smarter move on his part is to attempt to hide behind baseless accusations of process.\\"  U.S. Helsinki Commission testimony  In July 2018, Tygart testified before the U.S. Helsinki Commission in Washington, DC on the subject of doping in sports. He was on a panel alongside Jim Walden, the attorney for Russian Whistle-blower Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, Yuliya Stepanova, a former Russian track star, and Katie Uhlaender, a four-time member of the U.S. Skeleton team. Tygart submitted eight pages of testimonyhttps://www.usada.org/wp-content/uploads/Helsinki-Commission-Written- Testimony-Travis-Tygart.pdf and told the Commission he would continue attempting to persuade Congress to address international doping.

The congregation first met in 1877, becoming an organized mission in 1897. History The first church service in Ahnapee, the former name of Algoma, was held by the Rt. Rev'd John Henry Hobart Brown, Bishop of Fond du Lac, on Aug. 15, 1877, one person being confirmed, and an infant baptized. The first building, named “Grace Church”, was built in 1878 according to a design by Richard Upjohn (architect of New York City’s famous Trinity Church, Wall Street, and founder of the American Institute of Architects). This was the first edifice to be constructed in the diocese following its organization in 1875. In 1877, a local paper noted: Grace Church burned to the ground in the spring of 1884. It was not until 1891 that the parishioners, with the encouragement and financial support of the second Bishop of Fond du Lac, the Rt. Rev'd Charles Chapman Grafton, could rebuild their church. The new edifice, reconsecrated as “St. Agnes-by-the-Lake”, was built on the old foundation and is an exact replica of the original Upjohn design. This new structure was also the first church to be built during Bp. Grafton’s episcopate. A separate parish house, comprising a guild hall and vicar's residence, was completed two years later. The arrival in 1897 of the Rev’d Dr. W.R. Gardner, SSJE, sometime dean (president) of Nashotah House Seminary, marked the beginning of Anglo-Catholic liturgical practice at St. Agnes. It is during his tenure that \\"High Mass\\", including use of incense and other sacramental symbolism, became normative Sunday practice. It is also during this time that the present altar and carved wood statuary were installed. The figures on the rood beam (Jesus, St. Mary, and St. John) were carved by artists from Oberamergau, Germany, who were brought over to Wisconsin by Bp. Grafton to do extensive carving for St. Paul's Cathedral, Fond du Lac. During this time, several additional rood groupings were carved, one of which was presented to St. Agnes Church. After Dr. Gardner’s death in late 1906, the Rev'd H.W. Blackman became the next resident vicar. As a result of Fr. Blackman’s 33-year tenure, the churchmanship introduced by Dr. Gardner continued to flourish, and was further heightened and secured by the introduction of the Anglican Missal (i.e., American-SSJE). Bishop Grafton, Dr. Gardner, and Fr. Blackman, prior to their residencies in Wisconsin, were all affiliated with Boston’s Church of the Advent, the mother church of the Anglo- Catholic movement in America. Highlights * Dr. Gardner, Fr.

The Grand hetman of Lithuania Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, while resting his forces in Birże (Biržai), learned of Swedish deployments from Pärnu (present-day Estonia) moving towards Daugavgrīva (in present-day Latvia) and set out to cut these off. However the Swedish units managed to enter Daugavgrīva before Chodkiewicz's arrival and as a result the hetman turned back and moved towards Pärnu, hoping to take the defenders there under command of Daniel von Wochen by surprise. Chodkiewicz's forces arrived on February 28, 1609 but when his troops tried to creep up to the city's walls unnoticed the Swedish garrison fired their cannons which established that a surprise attack was not going to work. Chodkiewicz then, feigning a withdrawal, hid his forces in nearby woods forbidding his soldiers to even light camp fires, despite the freezing cold of the Estonian winter. After a night's wait he raised his troops and marched them back against the city and this time managed to surprise the defenders. The Polish–Lithuanian miners blew up three of the main gates of the city and Lithuanian troops fought their way to the city's center. When the Polish troops began setting fire to the gate of the town's fortress, to which the remaining Swedish troops had withdrawn, the Swedish garrison threw the keys to the gate out of the window as a signal of surrender. About half of the Swedish forces, mostly Scottish mercenaries, subsequently switched sides and joined Chodkiewicz's troops. After capturing the city, Chodkiewicz left 200 infantry in Pärnu, and began a march towards Riga (then in Polish hands) which was threatened with a siege by the Swedes. On the way however, he attacked Salacgrīva (Salis) which turned into a semi-naval battle and the next major engagement of the conflict. Charles IX of Sweden later accused Daniel von Wochen of collaborating with the Poles which he believed, was the reason for the surrender. Wochen was then arrested, sentenced to death and executed.Claes-Göran Isacson, Vägen till stormakt - Vasaättens krig (2006), Stockholm, Norstedts. Page 333.

The entire length of US 82 Bus. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. The roadway that would eventually become US 82 Bus. was established by the end of 1921 as part of SR 50 in the city. By the end of 1929, this segment of SR 50 was indicated to be under construction. By the middle of 1930, this segment had a completed hard surface. Between February 1948 and April 1949, US 82 was designated on this portion of SR 50. Between June 1960 and June 1963, the path of SR& 50 through Albany was split into SR 50N and SR 50S. SR 50N used Broad Avenue and Sylvester Road, while US 82/SR 50S used Oglethorpe Avenue and Albany Expressway. In 1968, a northeastern bypass of the main part of Albany was proposed as a northern extension of SR 333 from the interchange of US 19/SR 333 and US 82/SR 50S in the eastern part of the city to US 19/SR 3W in the northwestern part of the city. In 1973, SR 50N was redesignated as SR 50 Conn., while SR 50S was redesignated as the SR 50 mainline. The next year, the bypass in Albany was built as a freeway, but there was no indication as to what highways were designated on it.
