He previously served as a Junior Deputy Press Secretary from 2017 to 2019. In July, 2020, Gidley became the press secretary of the Trump presidential re-election campaign.  Early life and career  Gidley was born in El Dorado, Arkansas. He graduated from the University of Mississippi with a degree in broadcast journalism and a minor in political science in 1998. In college, Gidley was a member of the Young Republicans.  Career  Gidley served as the director of Huck PAC. His past activities include director of media operations for Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Executive Director of the South Carolina Republican Party, Press Secretary to the David Beasley for Senate campaign, the Karen Floyd for Superintendent of Education campaign, and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Dole's campaign committee. He was the director of communications for the 2012 presidential campaign of Rick Santorum. = Trump administration = The Trump administration announced on October 10, 2017 that Gidley would serve as a Junior Deputy Press Secretary, and he started his job at the White House the day after. In February 2018, Gidley said that Trump was speaking \\"tongue-in- cheek\\" when Trump said that it was \\"treasonous\\" for Democrats not to applaud him during the State of the Union address. Later that February, after Special Counsel Mueller's investigation led to the indictments of a number of Russians for election interference, Gidley said that Democrats and the media had done more to create \\"chaos\\" in the United States than the Russian government. In January 2019, Gidley was promoted to the position of Deputy Press Secretary, succeeding Raj Shah. In June 2019 Gidley was considered a candidate for White House Press Secretary when Sarah Sanders announced she was stepping down from the role. Stephanie Grisham was named to the position with Gidley continuing on as Deputy Press Secretary. On September 5, 2019, The Washington Times published an opinion piece written by Gidley and press secretary Stephanie Grisham, titled \\"The Washington Post's lost summer\\". The authors asserted the Post had not reported on several Trump accomplishments, although the paper actually did report on them. In one instance, the piece linked to a Post story titled \\"Trump becomes first sitting president to set foot into North Korea\\" as the authors asserted the paper had not reported the event. In June 2020, Gidley resigned from his position as White House Deputy Press Secretary to serve as the national press secretary of the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign. He was succeeded as deputy press secretary by Brian R. Morgenstern, a former official in the United States Department of the Treasury.

Cardinal Courier The Cardinal Courier was the student newspaper at St. John Fisher College in Pittsford, New York. The newspaper was published bi-weekly on Wednesdays. The Courier published 12 issues per year. The newspaper was named the New York Press Association's Best College newspaper for 2008 and was twice awarded General Excellence by the NYPA (2002 and 2008). The paper ceased publication in 2015 after the college decided print media had no lessons to teach students. =History= The original Courier flag (2002-2007).On April 23, 2002, students at Fisher launched the Cardinal Courier, a new newspaper. Led by John Follaco and Kara Race, this publication replaced the previous paper, The Pioneer. The Pioneer had fallen into disarray and had an ever- shrinking staff. Editors had resigned and the paper had been too closely affiliated with Fisher's student government. After shutting The Pioneer, time was spent researching other papers and determining the direction the new paper should go. The Courier represented a distinct opposite from the last years of The Pioneer as the younger paper has won several awards, including Columbia and New York Press Association Awards. In 2007, the Courier won the New York Press Association's Best Sports Coverage award for 2006. Over its existence, the Courier expanded from an eight-page publication to a publication of at least 24 pages an issue. The Courier covered all aspects of the college, including news, opinion, lifestyles and sports. During the Courier's early years, Lisa \\"Murph\\" Murphy held the position of media adviser. Murphy played a vital role in acquiring the resources needed for the Courier to become the campus media influence that it is now. At the end of the 2005-06 school year, Murphy stepped down from the position to take the position of media adviser at Buffalo's Medaille College student newspaper. In 2008, Murphy was recognized for her contributions by induction into St. John Fisher College's Jack Palvino Communication/Journalism Hall of Fame. With the departure of Murphy, Steve Boerner was hired as the new media adviser for the Cardinal Courier. The next year posed a rough transition for the Courier. Its long-time adviser was gone, many of the final remnants from the founding Courier generation had graduated and membership saw a steep decline. The Spring Semester of 2007, with Bill Kuchman as the new editor in chief, became a period of rapid growth for the Courier. The organization moved from solely publishing a newspaper to additionally publishing a magazine, C Magazine, and maintaining a website, Cardinal Courier Online. With the September 19, 2007 edition, the Courier launched its redesign. Almost every aspect of the paper was changed — from the flag to typefaces to layout. The changes in management along with the new media offerings proved to be an effective recruiting tool. The \\"Courier\\" ceased publication in 2015. In a statement, department chair Jeremy Sarachan said that the print product was no longer an \\"appropriate [platform] for our students to write and disseminate news in a manner that gives them the specific educational experiences they need.\\"https://www.facebook.com/kyle.hayes.965/posts/988243026539?comment_id=988345087009&comment;_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R8%22%7D Executive Editor & Editor in Chief During the Courier's lifetime, 17 students have served as the paper's editor in chief.

All Fisher athletes were eligible and the award was voted upon by the Courier sports department. For 2007, the same criteria was used as the 2006 awards, except that both the Courier and Cardinal Television's Fisher Sports Desk voted on the recipients of the award. Starting in 2008, the Courier went back to the format that it used in 2006. In 2013, the 2007 format was used again, as part of the Courier's and CTV's efforts to work together. C Magazine On April 20, 2007, the inaugural issue of C Magazine, a lifestyles publication, was released. Beginning with the 2007 Fall Semester, C Magazine will be published twice a year.

He is emeritus Chichele Professor of Medieval History at the University of Oxford and Fellow of All Souls College. He was Professor of Early Medieval History at the University of Birmingham from 1997 to 2005. Early life Wickham was born on 18 May 1950. He was educated at Millfield, a public school in Street, Somerset, England. From 1968 to 1975, he studied at Keble College, Oxford. He graduated from the University of Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. He then remained to undertake postgraduate research and completed his Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in 1975 with a thesis entitled Economy and society in 8th century northern Tuscany. Academic career Wickham spent nearly thirty years of his career at the University of Birmingham. He was a Lecturer from 1977 to and 1987 and a Senior Lecturer from 1987 to 1989. He was promoted to Reader in 1989, and made Professor of Medieval History in 1993. In 2005, he was appointed Chichele Professor of Medieval History in the University of Oxford and Fellow of All Souls College. Since September 2015, he has been Head of the Humanities Division of the University of Oxford. He retired at the end of the 2015/2016 academic year, in line with Oxford's mandatory retirement policy. Upon retirement, Wickham was appointed Professor of Medieval History on a part-time basis at the University of Birmingham. From June 2009 to July 2011, Wickham served as a company director of the Past and Present Society. On 6 July 2013, Wickham was appointed a company director of the Past and Present Society. He retains this position as of 2019. =Scholarship= His main area of research is Medieval Italy – and more specifically Tuscany and central Italy – from the end of the Roman empire through to about 1300. His emphasis has largely been social and economic, though he has undertaken study into the legal and political history of the area as well. More generally Wickham has worked under a modified Marxist framework on how European society changed from late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, and has pioneered comparative socio- economic analysis in this period. In 2005 his work Framing the Early Middle Ages was published, which claims to be the first synthesis of early medieval European history since the 1920s. It is exceptional for its use of hitherto unincorporated evidence from both documentary and archaeological sources, as well as its bold use of comparative methods and rejection of national narratives. It has been recognised by various prizes, including the Wolfson History Prize in 2005, the Deutscher Memorial Prize in 2006 and the American Historical Association awarded its James Henry Breasted Prize in January 2007. He has recently just edited Marxist History Writing for the Twenty-First Century, a volume that sees various academics discuss the status and profile of Marxist historiography, and has now produced a general history of early medieval Europe, published by Penguin, which examines cultural, religious and intellectual developments of the period not covered in his previous socio- economic study. Personal life Wickham is married to Leslie Brubaker, the Professor of Byzantine Art at the University of Birmingham. He is a member of the Labour Party, and was previously a member of the Democratici di Sinistra (Democrats of the Left). Honours In 1998, Wickham was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). In 2006, he was awarded the Wolfson History Prize for his book Framing the Early Middle Ages: Europe and the Mediterranean 400–800. In 2014, he was awarded the Serena Medal by the British Academy \\"in recognition of his reputation as a medieval historian of exceptional distinction who has transformed our understanding of the early medieval Italian world.\\".

Beseler studied law at Kiel and Munich. He was forbidden to teach law in Kiel in 1833 due to his political activity, but he lectured at Göttingen, and Heidelberg. In 1835, he became a professor in Basel, 1837 in Rostock, 1842 in Greifswald and 1859 in Berlin. He was rector of the University of Berlin in 1862–1863, 1867–1868 and 1879–1880. A liberal nationalist, Beseler was a member of the Frankfurt Parliament where he participated in writing the failed 1849 German constitution. From 1849 to 1852 and from 1857 to 1887 he was a member of the Prussian House of Lords, 1850 of the Erfurt Union Parliament and 1874 to 1877 of the Reichstag. As a notable \\"Germanist\\" opponent of the \\"Romanists\\", led by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Beseler advocated a \\"people's law\\" based on Germanic principles as opposed to the Romanists' \\"jurists' law\\". The notions of cooperative law and social law later enunciated by Otto von Gierke originate with Beseler. He was also involved in liberalising the codes of civil and criminal procedure, and in crafting the 1851 Prussian criminal code.

It was first bred at the Benedictine Monastery of Einsiedeln. They are now raised at the Federal Stud at Avenches.  Origins  This horse was founded in the 10th century, but then improved in the 19th century by Anglo-Norman mares and a Yorkshire Coach Horse stallion named Bracken. The breed's most important bloodlines are from Anglo-Norman horses. The three most important of them were Ivoire, Que d'Espair, and Orinate de Messil. The Swedish Warmblood Aladin also had a strong influence on the Swiss Warmblood, along with two Holsteiners, Astral and Chevalier. After World War II Sweden disbanded its cavalry and all but 500 of its old Warmbloods (in Sweden called half-bloods) were slaughtered. Those 500 left were sold to the Swiss Government.  Breed characteristics  The Swiss Warmblood generally stands between 15.1 and 16.2 hands high, and their coat may be any color except pinto and appaloosa. The breed has a well- proportioned head with a straight or slightly convex profile. The chest is broad and deep and the shoulders sloping and long. They have prominent withers, a straight back, and a slightly sloping croup. The legs are strong, and have well-defined tendons and good joints.  Uses  Swiss Warmblood horses are often used for riding. They are suitable for all sorts of riding. Also, the Swiss Warmblood is an ideal cavalry troop horse.  Breeding  To breed, these horses need to go through tests. The stallions are tested at years old and then again at 5 years old. In testing they have to go through jumping courses, dressage, cross-country, and driving. Stallions are only selected if their parents have proven performance ability. Swiss Warmblood mares are tested at 3 years of age. They cannot be registered unless their parents are registered as half-breds.

This helps to provide a level playing field so that conservation and local self-determination voices can be heard in development and resources decisions often conducted behind walls of expensive technologies and inaccessible data. Providing high-tech support, training and tools in an \\"appropriate technology\\" manner so that these tools are usable and beneficial for local activists, local programs and local communities is a core value of SCGIS. In 2018, Scgis was given the John Muir Association Nonprofit Conservation Award for \\"leadership in the advancement of environmental protection or conservation\\".Scgis Annual Report 2018-2019 https://scgis.org/documents/2018-19.pdf Cover of 1999 issue of SCGIS newsletter The multidisciplinary nature of cultural and natural resource conservation efforts benefits greatly from computer-based tools that manage information. In addition to data management, computer-based tools greatly enhance the communication of conservation ideas to policymakers and the public. One of the most effective computer-based tools is a Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS consists of software, hardware, geographic data, and scientific methods that can efficiently store and analyse various types of spatial data and display these data as maps, charts, videos, images, or other graphic types. Supported by an all volunteer staff, a volunteer Board of Directors and Advisory Council, SCGIS hosts an annual conference that features discussion panels on the integration of GIS and conservation science, user group meetings, hands-on training sessions, and workshops. This Annual Conference, led by an all-volunteer Conference Committee, is recognized as a one-of-a-kind event that attracts GIS conservationists from all over the world. Technical seminar programs that are offered before and after the conference are especially popular; members who participate in the training and conference often report that their involvement has changed their lives. Published & filmed proceedings and Interviews have been created for member access since 2016 by the Scgis Camera Team. The Scgis Communications & Website committees support the official website with member-exclusive content including hundreds of technical workshops, conference proceedings & webinars. The SCGIS Global Committee oversees dozens of international chapters (as of 2019), an annual competitive Scholarship Program, and a growing global network of certified Conservation GIS Trainers.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The sonnet is generally grouped with the preceding two in the sequence, with which it shares a dominant trope and image set: the beloved is described in terms of, and judged superior to, nature and its beauties. Paraphrase I criticized the violet, telling it that it had stolen its sweet smell from my beloved's breath, and its purple color from my beloved's veins. I told the lily it had stolen the whiteness of your (that is, the beloved's) hands, and marjoram had stolen the beloved's hair; a third flower had stolen from both; in fact, all flowers had stolen something from the person of the beloved. Structure Sonnet 99 is one of only three irregular sonnets in Shakespeare's sequence (the others being Sonnet 126 which structurally is not a sonnet at all but rather a poem of six pentameter couplets, and Sonnet 145 which has the typical rhyme scheme but is written in iambic tetrameter). Whereas a typical English or Shakespearean sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet, with the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, this sonnet begins with a quintain yielding the rhyme scheme ABABA CDCD EFEF GG. Like the other sonnets (except Sonnet 145) it is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 8th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / The roses fearfully on thorns did stand, (99.8) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The meter demands several variant pronunciations: line 1's \\"violet\\" is pronounced with three syllables, line 6's \\"condemnèd\\" also with three, line 11's \\"robbery\\" with two. Line 14's \\"flowers\\" is pronounced as one syllable, and \\"stol'n\\" always appears as one syllable (in lines 7, 10, and 15). Line 13's \\"eate\\" equals modern past tense \\"ate\\". As to its fifteen lines, sonnet structure has never been absolutely fixed, and Sidney Lee adduces many examples of fifteen line sonnets. An extra line is particularly common in linked sonnets, and this sonnet is linked to 98; Malone ended 98 with a colon to demonstrate the connection. However, other scholars have remarked on the clumsiness of the first line and suggested that the quarto text represents an unrevised draft that found its way into print. Source and analysis Edward Massey and others asserted that the poem was directly inspired by a poem in Henry Constable's Diana (1592); T. W. Baldwin rejected this claim while noting that the same Constable sonnet had inspired a passage in The Rape of Lucrece. At any rate, the conceit is common, and parallels have been found in the poems by Edmund Spenser, Thomas Campion, and others. George Wilson praised the poem as an example of synesthesia. The sonnet has attracted some attention as one of those that appears to provide clues about the historical identity of Shakespeare's subject (on the traditional assumption that the poems are in some sense autobiographical). In 1904, C. C. Stopes noted the existence of a portrait of Southampton at Welbeck Abbey in which his hair curls in a manner similar to young marjoram. This analysis has been disputed by scholars who assert that smell, rather than appearance, is the primary referent of Shakespeare's line. Because of the extravagant praise of the beloved's body, some Victorian scholars were reluctant to believe that the poem was addressed to a man; current consensus, however, groups it with the other poems written to the young man.

As any distant object will appear to do, it seemed to move along with them as they went down river. Upper and Lower South Branch Ponds are at the western base of the Traveler. Three ridges descend the western slopes of the mountain and provide access to the summit. These ridges are from North to South: North Traveler Ridge, Center Ridge and Pinnacle Ridge.

There are six portions, three of them being major, named Wall Road, Lees Corner Road, Stringfellow Road, Clifton Road, Main Street (in the Town of Clifton) and Burke Lake Road. There are also numerous overlaps (mostly unposted): some include SR 657 / Centreville Road, U.S. Route 50, SR 652 (Burke Rd), SR 612 (Yates Ford Rd/Henderson Rd), and SR 641. A concurrency used to exist at US 29 near Centreville until the 1990s. Route description View northwest along SR 645 (Main Street) in Clifton A map of Fairfax County shows that SR 645 is somewhat circuitous: Wall Road is east-west, Lees Corner Road, Stringfellow Road, and the northern part of Clifton Road are north- south, the rest of Clifton Road is mostly east-west, and Burke Lake Road is northeast-southwest. =Wall Road= SR 645 starts in Oak Hill at a cul-de-sac between SR 28 (Sully Road) and SR 657 (Centreville Road). It goes one block and terminates at SR 657. =Lees Corner Road= At this point SR 645 turns south and is concurrent with SR 657, Centreville Road. SR 645 then turns southeast along Lees Corner Road in Herndon. It terminates at U.S. Route 50, Lee Jackson Memorial Highway, in Chantilly. =Stringfellow Road= At this point SR 645 turns east and is concurrent with US 50. SR 645 then turns south in Fairfax. Once south of U.S. 50, Stringfellow Road serves as the ZIP Code border between Chantilly (20151) and Fairfax (22033). The road passes through the Greenbriar development, where it intersects with SR 4831, Poplar Tree Road. It then passes by Fair Lakes' western end where the Fair Lakes Parkway terminates at SR 645. After this, Stringfellow Road passes east of the Stringfellow Road Park & Ride, a park and ride facility, and has an interchange with Interstate 66. From 5:30 to 9:30 a.m. weekdays, HOV-2 traffic is allowed to enter I-66 eastbound from Stringfellow Rd. Westbound traffic can exit onto Stringfellow Road at all other times, but the exit is restricted to HOV-2+ traffic weekdays from 3:00 to 7:00 p.m.I-66 West HOV Ramps Now Open Off-Peak and Weekends . Retrieved February 28, 2011 South of the I-66 interchange, Stringfellow Road heads to an intersection with U.S. Route 29 (Lee Highway) at the Fairfax/Centreville/Clifton border. A project was completed to widen Stringfellow Road from SR 7735 (Fair Lakes Boulevard) to US 50 from two lanes to four (Stringfellow Road from Interstate 66 to US 29 was widened to four lanes in the 1990s). The rationale for this project was that VDOT saw that Stringfellow Road was a major connector between US 29 and US 50, and was a very congested road. The project included: * Five- to six-foot-wide () sidewalk on the west side of the road * Ten-foot-wide () shared-use path on the east side * Wide curb lanes in order to accommodate bicyclists Stringfellow Road VDOT Project Retrieved September 04, 2009Stringfellow Road Fairfax Board Endorsement Retrieved September 04, 2009 =Clifton Road (north of Clifton)= After crossing U.S. 29, SR 645 becomes Clifton Road and has entered the Clifton ZIP code (20124). The road remains four lanes and the speed limit remains 45 MPH. After about half a mile the road intersects with SR 620, Braddock Road. After crossing SR 620 Clifton Road reduces from four to two lanes, although the speed limit remains 45 MPH. After passing by the Twin Lakes Golf Course, the road intersects with SR 654, Popes Head Road, and enters a rather equestrian area for about before reaching the Clifton corporate limits. During that approach the speed limit is gradually reduced to 25 MPH before intersecting with Newman Road. The road then turns and enters the town. This portion of SR 645 has been designated a Virginia Byway. =Main Street (town of Clifton only)= In the town SR 645 intersects with Chapel and Kincheloe roads before it leaves the town (one must turn left to stay on SR 645). Also in the town SR 645 crosses the Southern Railway (US) tracks. Infrequently SR 645 is impassable due to flooding from Pope's Head Creek. =Clifton Road (east of Clifton)= Once past the town's corporate limits, the speed limit increases to 35 MPH. It then intersects with SR 643 / SR 612 (Henderson Road) which draws heavy traffic because it leads to the only crossing between Fairfax County and Prince William County that is not physically located at or near Woodbridge or Manassas. Crossing into Fairfax Station, Clifton Road then intersects with SR 610 (Wolf Run Shoals Road). After the intersection the road heads east, and then intersects with SR 123. This portion of SR 645 has been designated a Virginia Byway. =Burke Lake Road= After crossing SR 123, SR 645 continues with two lanes, but the speed limit increases to 40 MPH. The road forms the northwestern boundary of Burke Lake Park. It then intersects with the Fairfax County Parkway (SR 286). SR 645 continues and widens from a two lane undivided road to a four lane divided highway, although the speed limit remains 40 MPH. It intersects with SR 643 (that road is called Burke Center Parkway to the west, and Lee Chapel Rd. to the east). SR 645 leaves Fairfax Station and enters Burke. It intersects with SR 652 (Burke Rd.) (this is a split intersection because it is near the bridge over the Southern Railway tracks) where the speed limit decreases to 35 MPH. It passes by Lake Braddock Secondary School and then leaves Burke when it intersects with SR 638 (Rolling Road), and crosses into Springfield. SR 645 ends at SR 620 (Braddock Road) on the Springfield / Annandale border.

State Chairman of the Anti-Masonic Party, and Superintendent of Pennsylvania Schools.  Early life  Born on November 16, 1805, in the town of Strasburg Pennsylvania Thomas Henry Burrowes' parents were natives of Ireland. At the age of five, the Burrowes family moved back to their homeland where he studied under the tutorage of scholars from Trinity College as well as clergymen of the Church of England until he was 12 years old. He continued his education by attending school in New York and studying the classics and eventually attended Yale Law School for only one year and was admitted to the bar in 1829.  Early career  Thomas Henry Burrowes, held a number of important positions including Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Mayor of Lancaster, Pennsylvania State Chairman of The Anti-Masonic Party, an elected member to the lower house of legislature (Pennsylvania House of Representatives), Superintendent of Schools, founder and editor of the Pennsylvania School Journal (1852-1870), and author of works such as the State Book of Pennsylvania, and Normal School Law, School Law and Decisions.  Penn State Career  In October 1868, The Agricultural College of Pennsylvania was looking for new leadership. After being nearly run into the ground by former president John Fraser, the school's student body had dwindled to 20 students, the school was showered in debt and people across the state were losing hope that the agricultural school would survive. The College had been plagued by financial troubles and was in danger of closing its doors. The board of trustees decided to invite important men of the time—including Thomas Henry Burrowes, an individual with much expertise in educational matters for the commonwealth of Pennsylvania—seeking advice in their search for a new President. Meeting Minutes suggest that Burrowes recommended to, \\"make the school more practical and less scientific; the president should have administrative ability as well as scientific and literary attainments; and to lower the cost of room and board and tuition as much as possible to attract a wider array of students.\\" At the board's next meeting, they chose Thomas Henry Burrowes to lead the school; he accepted the offer on December 10 with a $1,000 increase in wages, the use of the president's house and grounds and enough feed for two horses and two cows. Although Burrowes had never worked at a college, his hiring restored faith in the state that the school would thrive. His contemporaries described him saying, \\"President Burrowes took charge of affairs with his customary confidence, enthusiasm, and vigor, infusing new life and hope into what had seemed to some to be a hopeless cause.\\" He immediately made changes including reestablishing the school's focus as an agricultural school, changing the year's term to run February to December—to better align with the crop cycle, and almost tripling the school's student body from 20 to 59. Burrowes believed that physical labor would instill pride in the school, and lessen homesickness. He required that men work on maintaining the grounds, building new roads, and working on the farms for their first two years of the Agricultural School's five-year program. In his student's recollections they agree with his philosophy saying that the cleaning of the grounds did instill pride because they were \\"happy to live in a beautiful garden.\\" However, he did not let the boys work alone and often was seen working on the farm himself. Thomas Henry Burrowes believed that a practical approach to farming was necessary and so created an annual harvest reception called Harvest Home when nearby farmers and alumni could come and learn about new farming techniques and machines. In fact, during the Harvest Home in 1870, a group of alumni decided to form a group to meet every Thursday night and so the Penn State Alumni Association was born. Thomas Henry Burrowes established close relationships with his students, and often took them on camping, hiking, and fishing trips, feeding them his famous Allegheny Stew. He was noted for his, \\"genial disposition, ready wit and fine conversational powers.\\" It was one of these trips into the mountains that Thomas Henry Burrowes caught a fatal cold. He died in office, on February 25 at the age of 65. http://www.libraries.psu.edu/digital/speccolls/psua/psgeneralhistory/bezillapshistory/083s01.htm  Burrowes' Landmarks and Legacy  Buried in St. Jame's Churchyard in Lancaster, a monument was erected over his grave. It reads \\"He gave his best; his giving was princely; his work has been grandly cumulative and will be so through the ages. To no man now living does Pennsylvania owe so great a debt of gratitude.\\" John Hamilton, a colleague of Thomas Henry Burrowes, eulogized him saying, \\"He came to this college in the darkest period of its history. The number of students had dwindled to a handful. Public confidence had been withdrawn. The institution had become involved in debt....President Burrowes brought with him the trust of the public, because his had been an educational career that was widely known in PA, both in itself and for the success that had attended it. And although he was not in the 65th year of his age, his enthusiasm and natural vigor seemed just as great as it had been years before. His presence reestablished public confidence, the number of students attracted by his reputation very greatly increased, the course of study was reformed, and the institution was put into practicable working condition. During his administration, the experimental farm at the State College was founded and put into operation. There can be no doubt of our indebtedness to Dr. Burrowes for most of this that we enjoy today, for it he had not assumed control at the period at which he did, in all probability the college would have ceased to exist.\\" A road named in his honor travels through the borough of State College and the University Park campus and leads to the Nittany Lion Shrine as well as the Burrowes Building.

He is a University Professor at New York University, where he teaches about the French New Wave filmmakers. Stam has published widely on French literature, comparative literature, and on film topics such as film history and film theory. He wrote with Ella Shohat Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media. Biography Born in Paterson, New Jersey, Robert Stam completed his Ph.D. in Comparative Literature at U.C. Berkeley in 1977, after which he went directly to New York University, where he has been teaching ever since. Stam's graduate work ranged across Anglo-American literature, French and Francophone literature, and Luso-Brazilian literature, a confluence which explains a basic feature of his scholarship – a tendency to cross-reference all of these cultural zones. His dissertation-later-book Reflexivity in Film and Literature (1985) traced reflexive strategies from Miguel de Cervantes to Jean-Luc Godard, tracing three broad types of artistic reflexivity based on the basic impulses undergirding them– ludic and playful (Fielding, Keaton), aggressive and avant-garde (Jarry, Buñuel); and didactic (Brecht and later Godard). Stam has authored, co-authored and edited some seventeen books on film and cultural theory, literature and film, national cinema (French and Brazilian), aesthetic and politics, intellectual history, and comparative race and postcolonial studies. With work that has ranged across a number of different fields, Stam has participated in a number of post-structuralist and postcolonial “turns” within film and cultural studies. A 1983 Screen essay “Colonialism, Racism, and Representation” brought post- structuralist theory to bear on issues of representations of colonial history and racial oppression. Attempting to go beyond the methodological limitations of the then dominant paradigm of “positive image” and “negative stereotype” analysis, Stam argued for an approach that emphasized not social accuracy or characterological merits but rather such issues as perspective, address, focalization, mediation, and the filmic orchestration of discourses. The concern with issues of colonialism, postcolonialism, race, and cultural difference also found expression in a number of seminal texts co-authored with Ella Shohat. Their 1985 Screen essay “The Cinema After Babel: Language, Difference, Power,” introduced a Bakhtinian “translinguistic” and trans- structuralist turn into the study of language difference, translation, and postsynchronization in the cinema. Their Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media (Routledge, 1994) formed part of and helped shape the surge of writing about race, colonialism, identity politics, and postcoloniality in the 1990s. Hailed by many critics, including Edward Said, as a “brilliant” and landmark book, Unthinking Eurocentrism combines two strands of work – an ambitious study of colonialist discourse and Eurocentrism – and a comprehensive and transnational study of cinematic texts related to those issues. One striking feature, which came to characterize all of the Stam-Shohat collaborations, was to see such issues within a longue duree by placing at the very center of the debate the various 1492s – i.e. the Inquisition against Jews, the expulsion of the Muslims, the conquest of the Americas, TransAtlantic slavery – at the center of the debates. A related strategy was to stress the centrality of indigenous peoples for the history of radical thought and resistance in the Atlantic world, which they began in their 2006 book Flagging Patriotism to call the “Red Atlantic.” Unthinking Eurocentrism addressed such issues as “Eurocentrism versus Polycentrism,” “Formations of Colonialist Discourse,” “The Imperial Imaginary,” “Tropes of Empire,” the “Esthetics of Resistance,” “postcolonial hybridity,” and “indigenous media.” (A 20th anniversary edition with a substantial update- Afterward was published in 2014). Stam and Shohat continued with an anthology -- Multiculturalism, Postcoloniality, and Transnational Media (Rutgers, 2003); followed by a more frankly political polemic which excoriated the militaristic pseudo-patriotism of the Bush/Cheney period -- Flagging Patriotism: Crises in Narcissism and Anti-Americanism (Routledge, 2006). Race in Translation: Culture Wars Around the Postcolonial Atlantic (NYU, 2012), finally, constituted an ambitious exercise in intellectual history which charted the multidirectional traffic of ideas around the “Red, Black, and White Atlantic.” More precisely, the book dealt with the postwar debates about colonialism, postcoloniality, race, multiculture and Affirmative Action in three cultural zones—the U.S., and Anglophone zone, France and the Francophone zone, and Brazil and the Lusophone zone. Contesting the monolingual and Anglo-Americano- centric approach to these issues, the book elaborates such concepts as “the seismic shift” provoked by the decolonization of culture, the radicalization of the academic disciplines, the philosophical centrality of indigenous thought, the “left/right” convergence on identity politics, and “inter- colonial narcissism.” Stam has also been a major figure within the “transtextual turn” in adaptation and intertextuality studies. Stam's later work in literature and film formed part of and helped advance the field of adaptation studies, which has been undergoing a boom since the turn of the 21st century. Stam's essay “Beyond Fidelity,” included in the James Naremore 1999 anthology Film Adaptation, called for a larger paradigm shift in which authors like Naremore, Dudley Andrews, Kamilla Elliot, Deborah Cartmell, Imelda Whelehan, Thomas Leitch, Jack Boozer, Christine Geraghty, Alessandra Raengo, and Linda Hutcheon moved from a binary novel-film fidelity approach to a more open transtextual approach. The interest in film-literature relations culminated in two monographs and two anthologies. Literature through Film: Realism, Magic, and the Art of Adaptation (Blackwell, 2005) offered a historicized account of key trends in the history of the novel – the proto- magic realism of a Cervantes, the colonialist realism of a Defoe (and his critics), the parodic reflexivity of a Henry Fielding or Machado de Assis, or proto-cinematic perspectivalism of a Flaubert, the neurotic narrators of a Dostoyevsky or a Nabokov, the feminist experimentations of Clarice Lispector and Marguerite Duras, and the “marvelous latin-american real” of Mario de Andrade and Alejo Carpentier, all as seen through the many filmic adaptations – both “faithful” and revisionist – of their work. Francois Truffaut and Friends: Modernism, Sexuality, and Adaptation (Rutgers, 2006), meanwhile, explored the “transtextual diaspora” generated by a highly literary ménage-a- trois in the 1920s that led to the books and published journals of Henri- Pierre Roche, Franz Hessel and Helen Hessel, as well as three films by Truffaut based on the life and work of Roche (Jules and Jim, Two Englishwomen, and The Man Who Loved Women). Two anthologies co-edited with Alessandra Raengo (both published by Blackwell) fleshed out the project: Literature and Film: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Adaptation (Blackwell, 2005), and Companion to Literature and Film (Blackwell, 2004). Another field of intervention for Stam has been in cultural theory, especially in Subversive Pleasures: Bakhtin, Cultural Criticism, and Film (Johns Hopkins, 1989), the first book-length study to extrapolate for film and cultural studies Bakhtin's conceptual categories, such as “translinguistics” and “dialogism” and the “carnivalesque.” Stam has also been an advocate-exegete of semiotics, poststructuralism, and film theory in such books as New Vocabularies in Film Semiotics: Structuralism, Poststructuralism, and Beyond (Routledge, 1992) and Film Theory: An Introduction (Blackwell, 2000), the first book to recount the history of film theory from its beginnings to the present within a transnational framework that included Latin America, Africa and Asia alongside Europe and North America. (Widely translated, the book has been used in film studies courses in many countries). Film Theory: An Introduction was published in tandem with two Blackwell anthologies co-edited with Toby Miller both from 2000: Film and Theory and A Companion to Film Theory. Brazilian cinema, literature, and popular culture form another node in Stam's research, ranging from the first book-length study in English of Brazilian Cinema (Brazilian Cinema (co-edited with Randal Johnson and first published in 1982 by Associated University Presses, then picked up, by University of Texas Press in 1989, and finally by Columbia University Press in 1992, this time with a new afterward penned by Stam, Joao Luiz Vieira and Ismail Xavier. Another book (Tropical Multiculturalism: A Comparative History of Race in Brazilian Cinema and Culture (Duke, 1997) offered the first book-length study in English of racial representation, especially of Afro-Brazilians, during the century of Brazilian Cinema, within a comparative framework in relation to similar issues in American cinema. Another ongoing interest has been in the convergence of aesthetic and political radicalism, where Stam has explored such concepts as \\"the aesthetics of garbage\\", \\"Afro-diasporic aesthetics\\", and “trance- Brechtanism,” which will form part of a forthcoming Blackwell book on radical politics and aesthetics – Keywords in Subversive Film Aesthetics. Robert Stam has taught in Brazil, France, Germany, Tunisia, and Abu Dhabi. Awards and honors Stam has won Woodrow Wilson, NDEA, Rockefeller, Fulbright, and Guggenheim Fellowships. In 2009, he was named a Fellow at the Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical Studies at Princeton, where he presented a paper on \\"The Red Atlantic\\". In 2006, he co-taught (with Ella Shohat) a seminar on \\"The Culture Wars in Translation\\" at Cornell's Society for Criticism and Theory. In 2003, Stam was honored at the Curitiba Film Festival for his \\"Noteworthy Service to Brazilian Cinema\\". In 2002, he was named “University Professor” at New York University, the institutions highest honor. In 1998: Honored by Africana Studies \\"Evening of Readings from Recently Published Work by Critically Acclaimed Authors\\" In 1995: a panel was dedicated to Unthinking Eurocentrism as opening for series of book-related events at the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco. Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media (co-authored with Ella Shohat) won the Katherine Singer Kovacs \\"Best Film Book\\" Award in 1994. Stam's Subversive Pleasures; Bakhtin, Cultural Criticism and Film was a Choice \\"Outstanding Academic Book of the Year\\" in 1989 and Runner-Up for the Katherine Singer Kovacs \\"Best Film Book\\" Award in the same year.

The book is split into two parts, the first which follows chronologically the events leading to the fall of Saigon in 1975 and mentions Palmer's position in those events. The second part is called 'Assessment' and more broadly calls out what was done right and wrong and also offers an alternate role the US could have played in the conflict: *The US ground forces should have been concentrated in the North and focused on interdicting the flow of soldiers and supplies down the Ho Chi Minh trail. *The South Vietnam army would have taken on the Viet Cong in the rest of the country, which without the support from the North could have been defeated or contained. *Instead of declaring openly that invasion of North Vietnam was out of the question for the purpose of relaxing the Soviet Union and China, the U.S. should have constantly threatened Hanoi with amphibious invasion while never intending to actually carry it out. Also, small scale raids into North Vietnam for one purpose or another would not be ruled out. *No strategic bombing of the North. Palmer is critical of covert operations: > War involves fighting by the armed forces in overt operations under rules > laid down by the Geneva Convention and acceded to by most civilized nations. > To place our uniformed military personnel in any other position is gross > breach of trust on the part of their government. War must be perceived as > legitimate in the eyes of the people and of the warriors entrusted to do the > fighting. For these same reasons I have always firmly opposed employing U.S. > military personnel in covert operations which the government can credibly > deny. Although Palmer is at times in agreement with the purpose of the operations carried out in secret, such as incursions into Laos or Cambodia, he disagrees strongly with the deception involved. Palmer saw Schlesingers's warnings to the military about observing the proper chain of command following the resignation of Nixon as being disrespectful to the integrity of the US military.

History The school was officially opened by the D. Rogers on 24 September 1957 as Great Barr Comprehensive School. The school had opened in September 1955 with thirteen forms of 11-year-old boys and girls and 615 pupils between the ages of 12 and 15, who were transferred from the Aldridge Road Boys and Girls Modern Schools which ceased to exist at that time. Mr Oswald Beynon MA was the first headmaster. The modern schools building had been incorporated into the comprehensive school and became the Lower School, with new buildings comprising the Middle and Upper Schools. The Lower school comprises the English and maths departments, with some Science and Technology rooms. The middle school is mainly made up of Technology rooms and the school's main library. The Upper School is primarily Science, Art, Religious Education, Personal Exercise and Modern Foreign Languages. In 2005, the school was designated as a specialist Science and Mathematics College. The school also gained a new specialist science building. On Thursday 24 November 2005 the school’s new state-of-the-art music block was opened by then head teacher, Brian Sherratt O.B.E. The date also marked the formal retirement of Dr Sherratt after 21 years at the school. Previously a foundation school administered by Birmingham City Council, in December 2016 Great Barr School converted to academy status and is now sponsored by The Shaw Education Trust. The school was later renamed Fortis Academy. = Artwork = relief showing boys relief showing girls The school's frontage features two carved reliefs, the left one showing three boys playing football; the right one three girls playing netball. Originally bare stone, these were painted circa 2013. Sixth Form Centre Adjacent to the main school is the Sixth Form Centre. The sixth form centre acts as a college and form of higher education after leaving the last year, year 11. It provides its students with a two-year course, first contains AS level study and the second year contains A2 level. Most students choose to enter the Sixth form after their last year, as it provides many different courses including Media Studies, Business Studies, Further I.T, Higher Musical Courses, Higher Science, Law, Psychology and many others. The main focus of the Sixth Form Centre is the library called the O.L.C (Open Learning Centre), the centre also contains many class rooms and space for students to study. The centre also contains a specialist Law Room that is made to look like a 'mock-up' court.

It houses the office of the mayor, the Common Council chamber, the city and traffic courts, as well as other city services. The present building was designed by Henry Hobson Richardson in the Romanesque style and opened in 1883 at 24 Eagle Street between Corning Place (then Maiden Lane) and Pine Street. It is a rectangular, three-and-a-half-story building with a tall tower at its southwest corner. The tower contains one of the few municipal carillons in the country. Albany's carillon was dedicated in 1927 through the donations of 25,000 people. It has 49 bells ranging from small to gargantuan. The carillon's largest bell has a 5'9\\" diameter and weighs 10,953 pounds and the smallest bell weighs in at only 27 pounds. Albany's first city hall was the Stadt Huys, built by the Dutch at the intersection of Broadway and Hudson Avenue probably in the 1660s, though possibly earlier. It was probably replaced around 1740 with a larger building, which continued to be known by the same name. In 1754, the Stadt Huys was the site of the Albany Congress, where Benjamin Franklin presented the Albany Plan of Union, the first proposal to unite the British American colonies. In 1797 Albany was declared the state capital of New York and the New York Legislature made its home in Albany's city hall. In 1809 the Legislature opened the first New York State Capitol and Albany's government moved in with the Legislature. After purchasing a plot of land at the eastern terminus of Washington Avenue, across Eagle Street from the capitol, the city government moved into a new city hall designed by Philip Hooker in 1829 and opened in 1832. In 1880, Hooker's city hall was destroyed by fire and a new design was commissioned from Henry Hobson Richardson. The cornerstone was laid by Masonic fraternity on October 13, 1881 and the building was completed and opened in 1883. Because of budget restrictions the original interior was of simple design, consisting chiefly of beaded board partitions, and thus not fireproof. The building's interior was entirely rebuilt in 1916-18 from designs by Albany architects Ogden & Gander. The city hall remains essentially as altered at that time, and the exterior is considered one of Richardson's finest works. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1972. Former city halls Albany has had multiple buildings dedicated to being the seat of city government over its history. However, historians disagree on details of many of the earlier structures, namely, when they were built. =Stadt Huys= alt=Black and white engraving shows a three-story building with a gabled roof and a belfry. Albany's original city hall, the Stadt Huys (; Dutch for \\"city hall\\"; sometimes written Stadt Huis) may have been built as early as 1635. Evidence from the journals of Wouter van Twiller, Director of New Netherland (1633–1638), suggests that at least some type of punitory building was built on the site during his term in office. George Howell and Jonathan Tenney, in their book Bi-centennial History of Albany, claim that reports from 1646 state the building was a substantial (at least for its time) three-story structure, with the lower floor built of stone and used as a jail. However Albany historian Cuyler Reynolds claims the Stadt Huys was not built until 1673. All sources agree that it stood at the northeast corner of today's Hudson Avenue and Broadway, the current site of the SUNY System Administration Building. The Stadt Huys officially became city hall when the Dongan Charter incorporated Albany into a city in 1686. An engraving of a 1695 map of Albany clearly identifies the Stadt Huys at the northeast corner of present-day Hudson Ave and Broadway. alt=A painting shows men standing outside a yellow building; the men are dressed in revolutionary clothing with tri-pointed hats and powdered wigs. It is probable that a new city hall was built on the site of the Stadt Huys around 1740; historians at the New York State Museum (NYSM) claim it to have been completed in 1741. Growing tired of increasingly cramped space, the city government was able to secure funds from the provincial government to construct a new city hall on the same site. This building was also commonly known as the Stadt Huys, even though it was a completely new structure and the English had been in control of New York for more than 75 years. The NYSM describes the new Stadt Huys as a three-story brick structure, adding that it was a \\"more substantial building\\" than its predecessor. This new building was the third-largest building in Albany, surpassed only by the local Dutch church (though not the one that stands today) and Fort Albany. The roof of the new structure was gabled and was topped with a cupola and belfry. Howell and Tenney claim that the original Stadt Huys was in use for at least 160 years (meaning a replacement structure would not have been needed until 1795 at the earliest), which is in disagreement with the idea that a new Stadt Huys was built in the 1740s. In 1754, the Stadt Huys was the site of the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania presented the Albany Plan of Union there. This was the first formal proposal to unite the British American colonies. The Plan of Union's original intention was to unite the colonies in defense against aggressions of the French to the north; it was not an attempt to become independent from the auspices of the British crown. Although it was never adopted by the British Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution.McEneny (2006), p. 12 A month prior to the meeting, Franklin published his Join, or Die political cartoon, an infamous graphical representation of the Plan of Union. During the Revolutionary War, city hall was home to the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the political arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government in 1775 and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County (which at that time was the largest county in the colony, extending far past its current borders). Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in city hall alongside common criminals. Following the war, city hall was an occasional meeting place of the newly formed New York Legislature, in addition to being home to the city and county governments, the jail, courts, and local registry. In 1797 Albany was declared the official capital of the state and the Legislature made city hall its home until the first state capitol was opened in 1809. In an effort to move public buildings away from the bustling and expanding waterfront, the new capitol was located atop the State Street hill, directly in front of the site where the current building now stands. City surveyor Simeon De Witt, in his 1794 plan of the city, indicates this land as being set aside as a public square; it had been dedicated for public purposes as early as the late 17th century. Also included on DeWitt's map are depictions of city hall and the new city jail, located at State and Eagle Streets. In 1809, Albany city government moved with the Legislature into the new capitol and remained there until a new city hall was opened in 1832. The old Stadt Huys was eventually demolished after a fire in 1836.Reynolds (1906), p. 516 =1832 city hall= Greek Revival building designed by Philip Hooker; it was destroyed by fire in 1880.alt=Old black-and-white photo shows a stone building with four columns in front and a domed roof. In an effort to move city and county government functions out of the state capitol building, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a site facing the public square opposite the capitol, on Eagle Street and at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was purchased from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars).Howell and Tenney (1886, Volume II), p. 677 The design of the new city hall was the result of a competition, that was won by Albany architect Philip Hooker and Boston architect John Kutts. Hooker was charged with integrating components of both architect's proposals into one coherent design. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend in a Masonic ceremony on August 31, 1829. The building was completed in 1832 at a cost of about $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the city hall combined neoclassical and Greek Revival detailing,Waite (1993), pp. 70–71 and was constructed of white marble quarried by inmates at Sing-Sing prison, with an entrance porch supported by six Ionic columns. A large belvedere supported a dome that was subsequently gilded. The principal rooms of the interior continued the monumental detailing of the exterior. A full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton by Robert Ball Hughes stood in the center of the upper hall, between the Court room and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one side of this hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt Clinton, with a view of a primitive canal-boat in the distance, and on the opposite wall was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. Both of these panels were executed by William Coffee. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880.Reynolds (1906), p. 687 Plans for a replacement city hall were quickly developed. Current city hall alt=A light building with dark trim stands on a street corner; it has an arched entrance at left, a double- peaked roof, and a 200-foot tower at the closest corner. Following the 1880 fire, Henry Hobson Richardson, who was then active as one of a team of architects working on the nearby New York State capitol, secured the commission for the replacement city hall after a limited competition between six architects and architectural firms. The budget for the new city hall was limited to $185,000; Richardson's design came in at $184,000. However the appointed public committee upped the price to $204,000 after granite was substituted for brownstone in the design.Ochsner (1982), p. 235 The new city hall design dates from the period that is typically regarded as Richardson's architectural peak. His design was similar to others executed in his personal version of the Romanesque style. Architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock described city hall as \\"one of Richardson's most Romanesque designs\\" and the building's NRHP nomination added: \\"Albany City Hall's banded arches, rhythmic fenestration, bold expression of materials and corner placement of the tower are characteristic features of Richardson's work often to be repeated by his followers.\\"Liebs (1972), p. 12 alt=Close-up view of details on the building show a carved gargoyle hanging off the top of a column. The building is a load-bearing masonry design laid out in a rectangle, with a tall, Venetian-style tower on its southwest corner topped with a pyramidal roof. The main structure is three-and-a-half stories tall and the front (west) face is nine bays wide.Leibs (1972), p. 2 The exterior walls are rusticated Milford (Rhode Island) granite with Longmeadow (Massachusetts) brownstone trim. Save for the bold asymmetrical placement of the tower (which is a prime example of Richardson's disregard for architectural correctness and known for being one of his best tower designs), the building is noted for its general simplicity in design. The entranceway is a simple triple-arch loggia; other design elements on the front façade are limited to its windows and a quadruple-arch balcony off the Common Council chamber. The building is simultaneously noted for its general simplicity and care for small details, especially its intricate carvings. The entranceway is flanked by multiple tiers of relief sculpture and gargoyles.Liebs (1972), p. 11 Most of the stone cutters originally brought to Albany to work on the capitol were later hired to do the sculptural details on city hall. Many elements of the exterior design are representations of interior functionality. Because the Common Council chamber is located on the second floor (above the entrance), that story is the same height as the first-floor entrance hall. The tower is essentially window-less because it was meant to be the city archive; a round staircase extends up the southeast corner of the tower for access. The short tower on the building's southeast corner was originally meant to be the transition between city hall and the (to-be built) jail, complete with a \\"bridge of sighs\\" to transport inmates straight from their cells in the jail to the court rooms in city hall.

Walls are wood paneled and the room is lit by two large chandeliers. Due to lack of funds at the time (the building's initial budget doubled, ending up at $325,000 ($ in modern dollars) including furnishings), Richardson devoted most of his efforts to the building's exterior. A report from the Times Union states, \\"There wasn't enough money for Richardson to do the job as thoroughly as he would have liked. He said in his writing that if there wasn't sufficient money, he'd rather do it right on the outside and leave it to a future generation to finish the interior. The interior was finished by city architects a good 30 years after Richardson built it.\\" The \\"city architects\\" were Ogden and Gander who designed the alterations in 1916 that were subsequently completed in 1918. The mayor's office is on the first floor of the tower, the Council chamber and offices are on the building's second floor, and the city clerk's office is on the second floor of the tower. The mayor's office contains a painting of the city's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler. Under the leadership of William Gorham Rice in 1927, a carillon was added to the tower; it contained sixty bells (though it could produce only 47 different notes since top notes have double bells) made by John Taylor & Co in England. Financed by public donations (from upwards of 25,000 people), it cost $63,000 ($ in modern dollars) and was the first municipal carillon in the United States. In 1986 Mayor Thomas Whalen had the carillon restored, which included replacing 30 bells and adding two notes to its repertoire. The 49 bells weigh . The largest bell is in diameter and weighs . The carillon is still in use and is played during concerts several times a week. The clock faces on the tower were added in the 1920s, possibly around the time the carillon was added. The 1897 image of the city hall above shows the tower without the clock faces (although the stonework shows obvious intent to have clock faces installed). City hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1972.

Life and work Imekanu, left, with Kindaichi Kyōsuke and Imekanu's sister Nami Kanai Imekanu belonged to an Ainu family of Horobetsu in Iburi subprefecture, Hokkaidō (Japan). She began to learn her repertoire of Ainu poetry from her mother, Monashinouku, a seasoned teller of Ainu tales who spoke very little Japanese. After converting to Christianity, Imekanu worked for many years for the Anglican Church in Japan as a lay missionary under the missionary John Batchelor, well known for his publications on Ainu language and culture. Batchelor introduced Imekanu to Kindaichi Kyōsuke, the most prominent Japanese scholar in this field, in 1918. After retiring from missionary work in 1926, Imekanu began to write down yukar known to her from Ainu tradition and continued to do so until her death. These texts in the Horobetsu dialect of Ainu amounted to 20,000 pages in 134 volumes. 72 of these volumes were destined for Kindaichi and 52 volumes for Imekanu's nephew Chiri Mashiho, a researcher specializing in Ainu linguistics. Chiri Yukie, Imekanu's niece and Chiri Mashiho's sister, grew up with Monashinouku and Imekanu, and she learned many of the Ainu yukar along with them. She wrote down thirteen yukar from this tradition, translated them into Japanese, and prepared a bilingual edition which appeared in 1923. This was the first publication of Ainu traditions by an Ainu author. Three of these yukar later appeared in English translation, alongside works by others, in Donald L. Philippi's Songs of Gods, Songs of Humans (1979). Kindaichi published Imekanu's version of the epic Kutune Shirka, alongside a version by Nabesawa Wakarpa, with commentary, in his two-volume study of the Ainu yukar in 1931.

Phytopathology is the study of plant diseases. It is a multi-disciplinary science since prerequisites for disease development are the presence of a susceptible host species, a pathogen and the appropriate environmental conditions. This is known as the disease triangle. Because of this interaction, the terminology used in phytopathology often comes from other disciplines including those dealing with the host species ( botany / plant science, plant physiology), the pathogen (bacteriology, mycology, nematology, virology), the environment and disease management practices (agronomy, soil science, meteorology, environmental science, ecology, plant breeding, pesticides, entomology), and areas of study that apply to both the host and pathogen (molecular biology, genetics, molecular genetics). The result is that most phytopathological glossary include terms from these other disciplines in addition to terms (disease incidence, horizontal resistance, gene-for-gene relationship, blast, scab and so on) that are specific to, or which have a unique meaning in phytopathology. This glossary is no exception. However, for the sake of brevity, it has, for the most part, restricted terms from other disciplines to those that pertain to the pathogen.

They are a recognized minority with their own language, schools and churches. Despite the relatively small number of Armenians living in Cyprus, the Armenian-Cypriot community has had a significant impact upon the Armenian diaspora and Armenian people. During the Middle Ages, Cyprus had an extensive connection with the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, while the Ganchvor monastery had an important presence in Famagusta. During the Ottoman Era, the Virgin Mary church and the Magaravank were very prominent. Certain Armenian-Cypriots were or are very prominent on a Panarmenian or international level and the fact that, for nearly half a century, the survivors of the Armenian Genocide have co-operated and co-existed peacefully with the Turkish-Cypriots is perhaps a unique phenomenon across the Armenian Diaspora. The emigration of a large number of Armenian-Cypriots to the United Kingdom has virtually shaped today's British-Armenian community. Currently, Armenians in Cyprus maintain a notable presence of about 3,500 on the island (including about 1,000 non- Cypriot Armenians), mostly centred on the capital Nicosia, but also with communities in Larnaca, Limassol and Paphos. The Armenian Prelature of Cyprus is located in Nicosia. According to the 1960 Constitution of Cyprus, together with the Maronites and the Latins, they are recognised as a \\"religious group\\" and have opted to belong to the Greek-Cypriot community and Armenian-Cypriots are represented by an elected Representative in the House of Representatives. Since May 2006, the Representative is Vartkes Mahdessian. The religious leader of the community, since June 2014, is Catholicosal Vicar Archbishop Nareg Alemezian, accountable to the Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia. History =Byzantine Era (578–1191)= Solidus of Emperor Maurice Armenians have had a presence in Cyprus since the 6th-century. According to Theophylact Simocatta, an early 7th-century Byzantine writer, the Byzantine General Maurice the Cappadocian captured 10,090 Armenians as prisoners during his campaign against the Persian King Chosroes I; around 3,350 of these prisoners were deported to Cyprus. More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor Heraclius for political reasons and also during the pontificate of Catholicos Hovhannes III Odznetsi for commercial reasons. Flowing on, after the end of Arab raids in Cyprus, more arrived by the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere who undertook the construction of Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an Armenian Apostolic church in the 10th century and was used by Armenian-Catholics during the Latin Era as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos Khatchig I established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia. Relations between Cyprus and the Armenians became closer when the Kingdom of Cilicia was established. Between 1136–1138, Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus moved the entire population of the Armenian city of Tell Hamdun to Cyprus. After Isaac Comnenus' wedding to the daughter of the Armenian prince Thoros II in 1185, Armenian nobles and warriors came with him to Cyprus, many of whom defended the island against Richard the Lionheart, when he landed in Limassol. =Latin Era (1191–1570)= Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca After the purchase of Cyprus by titular Frankish King of Jerusalem Guy de Lusignan in 1192, in his attempt to establish a western-type feudal kingdom, the latter sent emissaries to Europe, Cilicia and the Levant, resulting in a massive immigration of Armenians and other peoples. Because of their proximity, their commercial ties and a series of royal and nobility marriages, the Kingdom of Cyprus and the Kingdom of Cilicia became inextricably linked. In the subsequent centuries, thousands of Cilician Armenians sought refuge in Cyprus fleeing the Muslim attacks such as the Fall of Antioch. Cyprus became now the easternmost bulwark of Christianity; in 1441 the authorities of Famagusta invited Armenians from Cilicia to settle there. The Fall of Sis in April 1375 put an end to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia; its last King, Levon V, was granted safe passage to Cyprus. Although the Egyptian Mamelukes had taken over Cilicia, they were unable to maintain their hold on it; Turkic tribes eventually made their way to the region and established themselves there, leading to the conquest of Cilicia by Tamerlane. As a result, 30,000 Armenians left Cilicia in 1403 and settled in Cyprus, which continued to be ruled by the Lusignan dynasty until 1489. During the Frankish and the Venetian Eras, there were Armenian churches in Nicosia, Famagusta, Spathariko. Armenians were amongst the seven most important religious groups in Cyprus, in possession of stores and shops in the ports of Famagusta, Limassol and Paphos, as well as in the capital Nicosia, thus controlling a large segment of commerce. Additionally, Armenian was one of the eleven official languages of the Kingdom of Cyprus. According to chroniclers Leontios Makhairas, Georgios Boustronios and Florio Bustron, the Armenians of Nicosia had their own Prelature and used to live in their own quarter, called Armenia or Armenoyitonia. In Famagusta, a Bishopric was established in the late 12th century and Armenians lived around the Syrian quarter. Historical documents suggest the presence of an important monastic and theological centre there, at which Saint Nerses Lampronatsi is said to have studied. During the Middle Ages, Armenians in Cyprus were actively engaged in commerce, while some of them formed military garrisons in Kyrenia and elsewhere. A number of Armenians defended the Frankish Kingdom of Cyprus against the Genoese at Xeros, against the Saracens at Stylli village and against the Mamelukes in Limassol and Khirokitia. By 1425, the renowned Magaravank – originally the Coptic monastery of Saint Makarios near Halevga came under Armenian possession, as did sometime before 1504 the Benedictine/Carthusian nunnery of Notre Dame de Tyre or Tortosa in walled Nicosia. During the Latin Era, there was also a small number of Armenian Catholics in Nicosia, Famagusta and the Bellapais Abbey, where Lord Hayton of Corycus served as a monk. The prosperity of the inhabitants of Cyprus was brought to a halt by the harsh and corrupt Venetian administration and the iniquitous taxes they imposed. Their tyrannical rule, combined with adverse conditions, caused a noticeable decline in the island's population. According to historian Stephen de Lusignan, by the late Venetian Era, Armenians lived mainly in Famagusta and Nicosia and, in small numbers, at three \\"Armenian villages\\", Platani, Kornokipos and Spathariko. =Ottoman Era (1570–1878)= The Magaravank monastery (1967) During the Ottoman conquest of the island, about 40,000 Ottoman-Armenian craftsmen were recruited. Many of the Ottoman Armenians who survived the conquest settled mainly in Nicosia, increasing its Armenian population, while the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus was recognised as an Ethnarchy, through the millet institution. However, the Bishopric in Famagusta was abolished, as the Christian population was slaughtered or expelled and the entire walled city became forbidden for non-Muslims. As a reward for their services during the conquest, the Armenians of Nicosia were granted the right to guard Paphos Gate. However this privilege was used only for a short period. By a firman, they were given back the Notre Dame de Tyre church, which the Ottomans had turned into a salt store. Additionally, the Magaravank monastery had won the favour of the Ottomans and became an important way station for Armenian and other pilgrims en route to the Holy Land, as well as a place of rest for travellers and Catholicoi and other clergymen from Cilicia and Jerusalem. Contrary to the Latins and the Maronites, Armenians – being Oriental Orthodox rather than Catholic – were not persecuted because of their religion by the Ottomans. Even though about 20,000 Armenians lived in Cyprus during the very first years of the Ottoman Era, by 1630 only 2,000 Armenians remained, out of a total of 56,530 inhabitants. The Eramian Farm House in Pano Deftera In the Bedesten, there were many Armenian merchants and in the late 18th century/early 19th century Nicosia's leading citizen was an Armenian trader called Sarkis, who was a \\"beratli\\" and was initially the dragoman for the French Consul, before becoming the dragoman for the English Consul. Gifted with the acumen of industry, Armenians practised lucrative professions and in the beginning of the 17th century Persian Armenians settled in Cyprus as silk traders, as did some affluent Ottoman- Armenians in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Boghos-Berge Agha Eramian. However, with the new order of things, the number of Armenians and other Christians dramatically declined due to the onerous taxation and the harshness of the Ottoman administration, compelling many Christians to become Linobambaki, Crypto-Christians, which explains why former Armenian villages were inhabited by Turkish-Cypriots at the end of the 19th century. A few Armenian-Cypriots became Catholics through marriage with affluent Roman Catholic families. Gradually, after the bloody 1821 events, the Ottomans destroyed the Armenian and Greek mansions, prohibited Greeks, Franks, Armenians and Maronites from carrying guns and hanged or massacred 470 notables, amongst them the Armenian parish priest of Nicosia, der Bedros, some improvements were observed during the Tanzimat period. In the spirit of the Hatt-ı Şerif of Gülhane, the Armenian Bishop, the Greek Archbishop and the Maronite Suffragan Bishop participated in the Administrative Council, which was formed in 1840. After 1850, some Armenians were employed in the civil service, while in 1860 the Notre Dame de Tyre became amongst the first in Cyprus to have a belfry. Additionally, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 benefited the Armenian and other merchants of the island, while in 1870 the first Armenian school was established in Nicosia by newly arrived Archimandrite Vartan Mamigonian. Furthermore, as a result of the Hatt-ı Hümayun in 1856, the administrative autonomy of the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus was officially recognised. Based on various estimates, the Armenian- Cypriot community of the 19th century numbered between 150–250 persons, the majority of whom lived in Nicosia, with smaller numbers living in Famagusta, Larnaca, the north and south of the capital and, naturally, around the Magaravank. =British Era (1878–1960)= Geographical distribution of Armenian-Cypriots With the arrival of the British in July 1878 and their progressive administration, the already small Armenian community of the island was particularly strengthened. Known for their linguistic skills, several Armenians were contracted to Cyprus to work as interpreters and public servants at the consulates and the British administration, such as Apisoghom Utidjian. The number of Armenians in Cyprus significantly increased following the massive deportations, the massacres and the Genocide perpetrated by the Ottomans and the Young Turks. Cyprus welcomed over 10,000 refugees from Cilicia, Smyrna and Constantinople, who arrived in Larnaca and all its other harbours, about 1,500 of them made the island their new home. Industrious, cultivated and progressive, they brought new life into the old community and establish themselves as people of the arts, letters and sciences, entrepreneurs and merchants, craftsmen and photographers, as well as professionals who introduced new crafts, dishes and sweets to the island, thus contributing to Cyprus' socioeconomic and cultural development. The newcomers established associations, choirs, sports groups, Scout groups, bands, churches, schools and cemeteries throughout Cyprus. Armenians were the first locksmiths, mechanics, seat, comb and stamp makers, upholsterers, watchmakers and zincographers in Cyprus. They were the first to introduce the cinema, they significantly improved the craft of shoemaking and it was Armenians who first introduced Armenian bastourma, baklava, dried apricots, gassosa, gyros, halva, ice cubes, koubes, lahmadjoun, lokmadhes and pompes into the Cypriot cuisine. Armenians also introduced two techniques of embroidery needlework: the Aintab work and the Marash work. Victoria Road, Nicosia of the Armenian Quarter in the 1930s Law-abiding by nature, Armenian-Cypriots always had a high-profile with the British administration and many became conscientious civil servants and disciplined policemen or were employed at the Cyprus Government Railway and at Cable and Wireless. Throughout the 1920s–1950s, many worked at the asbestos mines at Amiandos and the copper mines at Mavrovouni and Skouriotissa, some of whom had been trade unionists. Some Armenian-Cypriots participated in the 1897 Greco-Turkish War, the two World Wars and the EOKA struggle. Also, the Eastern Legion was formed and trained between December 1916 and May 1918 in Monarga village, near Boghazi, consisting of over 4,000 Diasporan Armenian volunteers who fought against the Ottoman Empire. Some Armenian refugees arrived from Palestine and Egypt. The Armenian-Cypriot community prospered throughout the British Era, by establishing associations. In many ways unique across the whole Armenian Diaspora, it was built just outside Nicosia between 1924–1926, after the generous and benevolent donation of the Egyptian-Armenian tobacco trading brothers Krikor and Garabed Melkonian, initially in order to shelter and educate 500 orphans of the Genocide, who planted the trees in front of the school in memory of their slaughtered relatives. From an orphanage (1926–1940), it gradually became a world-renowned secondary school with a boarding section. =Independence Era (1960–present)= The end of the EOKA struggle found Armenian-Cypriots having forged strong bonds with the rest of the Cypriots. The 1960 Independence brought a new era for the Armenians of Cyprus, who – together with the Maronite and Roman Catholics – were recognised as a \\"religious group\\" by the Cypriot Constitution and were now represented by an elected Representative. The size of the community, however, had been reduced because of the emigration of about 900 Armenian-Cypriots to the United Kingdom, due to the emergency situation caused by the EOKA struggle and the poor state of the local economy. A second factor that contributed to the reduction of the community's size was the emigration of about 600 Armenian-Cypriots to Soviet Armenia, as part of the pan-Armenian movement for repatriation. During the intercommunal Cyprus crisis of 1963–64, the Armenian-Cypriot community suffered major losses, as the Armenian quarter of Nicosia fell into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area: taken were the Prelature building, the mediaeval Notre Dame de Tyre, the Melikian-Ouzounian school, the Genocide Monument, the club houses of the Armenian Club, AYMA and Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU), as well as the Armenian Evangelical church; also taken was the mediaeval Ganchvor church in Famagusta. In total, 231 Armenian-Cypriot families became victims and/or lost their shops and enterprises. As a result, hundreds of Armenian-Cypriots left for Great Britain, Canada, Australia and the United States. After the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the Armenian-Cypriot community suffered additional losses, several families became refugees, the renowned Magaravank monastery in Pentadhaktylos was taken by the Turkish troops, the Melkonian boys dormitory was bombed by the Turkish Air Force, while the Ayios Dhometios Armenian cemetery was hit by mortars and fell within the buffer zone. As a result, dozens of Armenian-Cypriots emigrated, mainly to Great Britain. In total, about 1,300 Armenian-Cypriots left Cyprus in the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to those who emigrated to Soviet Armenia. Demonstration on the Armenian Genocide and Nagorno-Karabakh in 1993 With the unfailing support of the government, the small yet industrious Armenian community of Cyprus gradually managed to recover from its losses and continued to prosper in the remaining urban areas, contributing culturally and socioeconomically to the development. On 24 April 1975, Cyprus became the first European country to recognise the Armenian Genocide with Resolution 36/1975; two more resolutions followed, Resolution 74/1982 and Resolution 103/1990, with the latter declaring 24 April as a National Remembrance Day of the Armenian Genocide in Cyprus. Over the past decades, the dynamics of the Armenian-Cypriot community have changed with the increased number of marriages with Greek-Cypriots and other non-Armenians, and the arrival over the last 30–35 years of thousands of Armenian political and economic immigrants because of the civil war in Lebanon, the insurgencies in Syria, the Islamic revolution in Iran and the Iran–Iraq War, as well as after the Spitak earthquake and the dissolution of the Soviet Union; some of them have settled permanently in Cyprus. According to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of the Council of Europe, the Armenian language – the mother tongue of the vast majority of Armenian-Cypriots – was recognised as a minority language of Cyprus on 1 December 2002. Today, it is estimated that the Armenians living in Cyprus number about 3,500. In Cyprus there is also a small number of Armenians coming from Ethiopia, Greece, Kuwait, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Demography There is no accurate information as to the number of Armenians living in Cyprus during the Byzantine Era. Although during the early Kingdom of Cyprus there were tens of thousands of Armenians living in Cyprus (mainly in Nicosia and Famagusta – where in the latter they numbered around 1,500 souls in 1360), by the late Frankish Era and certainly during the Venetian Era, the number of Armenians in Cyprus dwindled – for a number of reasons: this was due to the tyrannical rule of the Venetian administration, combined with the adverse natural conditions (which affected all Cypriots), as well as the Hellenisation of the various minorities of the island. In fact, the 1572 survey of population and property of Nicosia after the Ottoman conquest, under beylerbey Sinan Pasha, recorded 90–95 local Armenians in Nicosia, out of about 1,100 inhabitants – all with completely Hellenised names. Geographical distribution of the Armenians in Cyprus (1935 and 1956) Table showing the geographical distribution of Armenian-Cypriots (1881–1960) Table showing the urban distribution of Armenian-Cypriots (1881–1960) It appears that during the very first years of the Ottoman Era (1570–1878), about 20,000 of the 40,000 recruited Ottoman Armenians had remained in Cyprus. Their number, however, rapidly declined, due to the harshness and the oppression of the regime, the onerous taxation and the natural disasters: according to the Latin Bishop of Paphos, Pietro Vespa, in 1630 there were only 2,000 Armenians in Cyprus (out of a total population of 56,350 – mostly living in rural areas), as a great number emigrated elsewhere and many others embraced Islam or they became Linobambaki. Franciscan missionary Giovanni Battista da Todi recorded only 200 Armenians in Nicosia in 1647, while in 1660 he recorded over 300 Armenians on the island. Cardinal Bernardino Spada, representative of Propaganda Fide, also mentioned 200 Armenians in Nicosia in 1648, out of 3,000 inhabitants, also mentioning that their church was the largest in the capital, with 3 priests. Up until the mid-18th century, despite the limited arrival of Ottoman Armenians and Persian Armenians, their number was rather small. Russian monk Basil Barsky, who visited the island in 1727 and 1735, mentions \\"some Armenians\\" living in Nicosia. Visiting Cyprus in 1738, British traveller Richard Pococke mentions \\"very few Armenians, yet they have possession of an ancient church [in Nicosia]\\", while for the island as a whole he makes mention to \\"a small number of Armenians, who are very poor, though they have an Archbishop and a convent in the country\\". However, by the time Italian Abbot Giovanni Mariti visited Cyprus in 1760 and 1767, they had apparently become \\"the richest section of the inhabitants [of Nicosia]\\", which is why thought \\"there are many Armenians [on the island]\\". By the mid–19th century, following various waves of Hellenisation (peaceful assimilation) and Turkification (forced conversion), the number of Armenian-Cypriots ranged between 150–200. When the Scot John MacDonald Kinneir visited Cyprus in 1814, he estimated about 40 Armenian families in Nicosia (around 200 persons) – out of a total of 2,000 families (about 10,000 persons), as did British Consul Niven Kerr and Greek Vice-Consul Demetrios Margarites in 1844 and 1847, respectively. The first large-scale Ottoman census in 1831, under the supervision of Muhassil (governor) Halil Effendi, counted 114 non-Muslim males in the Armenian quarter of Nicosia and 13 at the Armenian Monastery (with a total male population of 45,365). Therefore, the number of Armenians in Cyprus would have been around 200 (out of a total of about 88,500). Visiting Cyprus in 1835, American missionary Rev. Lorenzo Warriner Pease writes \\"the number of Armenians [in Nicosia] is between 30 and 40 families\\". In 1841, about 200 Armenians lived on the island (out of a total of 108,600), of whom about 150-160 resided in Nicosia (with a population of 12,000) – according to the record of population by Muhassil Talât Effendi and the writings of French historians and travellers Louis Lacroix and Count Louis de Mas Latrie. The Latin Vicar General Paolo Brunoni also mentioned 200 Armenians in Nicosia in 1848, as well as some others at the Magaravank. In 1874 Belgian traveller Edmond Paridant-van der Cammen estimated 190 Armenians in Nicosia (out of a total of 13,530). Although unreliable for the Armenian population of Nicosia (mentioning only 20 families in 1875), researcher Philippos Georgiou recorded 6-8 Armenian families around the Magaravank and 5 Armenian families in Larnaca. In 1877, newly arrived priest Hovhannes Shahinian recorded 152 Armenians living in Cyprus, while the first modern population census of Nicosia, carried out in 1879 by the District Commissioner, Major-General Sir Robert Biddulph, counted 166 Armenians – out of a total of 11,197 inhabitants. The British colonial censuses that took place between 1881 and 1956 provide us with fairly accurate data on the Armenian population of Cyprus. The following numbers are the combined figures of those recorded as Armenians (by religion) and those recorded as speakers of Armenian: in 1881 there were 201 Armenians in Cyprus (of whom 174 belonged to the \\"Armenian Church\\"), who increased to 291 in 1891 (of whom 269 were \\"Gregorians\\" and 11 \\"Armenian Catholics\\") and to 553 in 1901 (of whom 491 were \\"Gregorians\\" and 26 \\"Armenian Catholics\\"); the numerical increase was due to the influx of Armenian refugees from the Hamidian massacres. In 1911 there were 611 Armenians in Cyprus (of whom 549 were \\"Gregorians\\" and 9 \\"Armenian Catholics\\"), while in 1921 their number rose to 1,573 (of whom 1,197 belonged to the \\"Armenian Church\\") and to 3,617 in 1931 (of whom 3,377 were \\"Armenian Gregorians\\"), as a result of the huge wave of refugees from the Armenian Genocide. In 1935 the Armenian Prelature recorded 3,819 Armenians in Cyprus: 102 were \\"native Cypriots\\" (mainly residing in Nicosia), 399 resided at the Melkonian Educational Institute, while 3,318 were \\"refugees\\", i.e. genocide survivors and their descendants; of those, 2,139 lived in Nicosia, 678 in Larnaca, 205 in Limassol, 105 in Famagusta, 58 in Amiandos, 25 in Lefka, 20 in Kalo Khorio (Lefka), 18 in Pano Lefkara, 17 around the Magaravank, 5 in Kyrenia, 4 in Paphos and 44 in various villages. In 1946 there were 3,962 Armenians in Cyprus (of whom 3,686 were \\"Armenian Gregorians\\"), while in 1956 they numbered 4,549. Current geographical distribution of Armenian-Cypriots The last accurate census of the population of Cyprus with regard to its ethnic breakdown was carried out in 1960; it recorded 3,628 Armenians in Cyprus (of whom 3,378 were \\"Armenian Gregorians\\"). In 1978 and 1987 the Armenian Prelature recorded the Armenian population of Cyprus, which was 1,787 and 2,742, respectively (however, without extra information regarding their geographical distribution). Since then, their number has increased; currently, about 3,500 Armenians live in Cyprus: 65% live in the capital, Nicosia, 20% in Larnaca, 10% in Limassol and 5% in Paphos and some villages. Over 95% of the Armenian population of Cyprus speak Armenian and are Armenian Orthodox (also known as Armenian Apostolic or Gregorian); some 5% belong either to the Armenian Evangelical Church, Armenian Catholic Church, Latin Church, Greek Orthodox Church, Anglican Church Plymouth Brethren Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church or they are Jehovah's Witnesses. About 1,000 out of the 3,500 Armenians who live in Cyprus hail from Armenia, Lebanon, Syria, Russia, Georgia, Persia, Greece, Iraq, Ethiopia, Turkey and Kuwait. Most of the first wave of Armenians from Armenia who arrived in Cyprus from 1988 onwards were in fact the Armenian-Cypriots and their descendants who emigrated to Armenia between 1962–1964, as part of the nerkaght (ներգամթ – repatriation) Panarmenian movement. Places of origin of Armenian-Cypriots, according to information collected by Archbishop Bedros Saradjian in 1935 According to available information, the about 1,000 refugees from the Hamidian massacres (1894–1896) mainly originated from Diyarbakir (Dikranagerd), Aintab and Kilis; only about 100 of them stayed. The next wave of Armenian refugees were the about 2,000 who fled the Adana massacre in 1909, most of whom returned to their ancestral homes in Adana within the same year. However, the largest wave of Armenian refugees – some of whom had come before and returned – were the nearly 9,000 who escaped the massive deportations, the horrific massacres and the genocide perpetrated by the Ottomans and the Young Turks; about 1,300 of them decided to stay, while the others eventually made arrangements to settle in other countries. Those refugees came mainly from Adana and Seleucia (Silifke), while there a significant number of them came from Sis, Marash, Tarsus, Caesarea, Hadjin and Aintab; smaller numbers came from other places, alphabetically: Adapazar, Adrianople (Edirne), Afion-Karahisar, Alexandretta (Iskenderoun), Arapgir, Armash, Baghche, Bardizag, Balian Dagh, Biredjik, Bitlis, Brusa, Chemishgezek, Constantinople (Istanbul), Dörtyol, Edessa (Urfa), Erzerum, Eskishehir, Everek, Ikonion (Konya), Jeyhan, Kesab, Kharpert, Kutahia, Malatia, Mersin, Misis, Musa Dagh (Musa Ler), Nicomedia (Izmit), Rhaedestos (Tekirdagh), Sasun, Sebastia (Sivas), Shar, Sivri Hisar, Smyrna (Izmir), Tokat (Evdokia), Trepizond, Van, Yerzinga, Yozgat and Zeitun. Politics Armenian-Cypriots have been politically organised since the late 19th century. The breakdown below examines their involvement in local administration, Cypriot politics and Armenian politics. =Local administration= With regard to local administration, the Armenian participation has been limited. Traditionally, there is the appointed mukhtar of Nicosia's Karaman Zade quarter (the Armenian Quarter). So far, there have been 4 mukhtars: Melik Melikian (1927–1949), Kasbar Delyfer (1949–1956), Vahe Kouyoumdjian (1956–2009) and Mgo Kouyoumdjian (2011–today). Bedros Amirayan served as an appointed member of Famagusta's municipal committee (1903–1905), Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian served as an appointed municipal councillor and, later on, Vice Mayor, for Nicosia (1964–1970), while Berge Kevorkian served as an appointed municipal councillor for Nicosia (1970–1986). =Cypriot politics= With the exception of the elected Representatives, so far there has been only one Armenian-Cypriot MP in the House of Representatives, Marios Garoyian. He was elected as an MP for Nicosia District on 21 May 2006 with the Democratic Party and in October 2006 he became the party's President. After the election of Demetris Christofias as President of the Republic of Cyprus in February 2008, Marios Garoyian was voted Speaker of the House of Representatives on 6 March 2008, the second highest political position in Cyprus. He was re-elected as an MP for Nicosia District on 22 May 2011 and he served as House Speaker until 2 June 2011. =Armenian politics= Despite its relatively small size, the Armenian-Cypriot community has been an active participant in Panarmenian politics already since the late 19th century, even though this became more established in the mid-20th century. All three major Armenian Diaspora parties are active in Cyprus, especially ARF Dashnaktsoutiun. It established its presence in Cyprus as early as in 1897 and it continued to be present on and off on the island until the early years of the 20th century. At that time, Cyprus was frequently used as a stepping stone for some European Armenian fedayees who had Asia Minor and Cilicia as their final destination. However, after the Armenian Genocide, the party presence became minimal, save for individual members, supporters and/or sympathisers, until it was re-organised after World War II and was officially re-established in 1947; its chapter is called \\"Karenian\\", after Armen Karo, who briefly visited Cyprus, in order to organise the assembly of weapons for the Zeitoun Resistance. ARF Dashnaktsoutiun is affiliated with the Armenian Young Men's Association (AYMA) in Nicosia, the Armenian Club in Larnaca and the Limassol Armenian Young Men's Association (LHEM) in Limassol, as well as with the Armenian National Committee of Cyprus, the Armenian Youth Federation of Cyprus, the \\"Azadamard\\" Armenian Youth Centre, the Armenian Relief Society of Cyprus and the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Association of Cyprus, all based in Nicosia. The Armenian Relief Society chapter of Cyprus is called \\"Sosse\\", after Sosse Mayrig, who visited Cyprus in the summer of 1938, while the Hamazkayin chapter of Cyprus is called \\"Oshagan\\", after Hagop Oshagan, who had been a professor at the Melkonian Educational Institute between 1926–1934. The ADL Ramgavar first appeared in Cyprus in the early 1930s, in the form of a core of party members. It also participated in the Diocesan Council elections of 1947, which caused a very big stir in community life. However, the party has officially been active in Cyprus since 1956. Its chapter is called Tekeyan, after Vahan Tekeyan, who had been a professor at the Melkonian Educational Institute between 1934–1935. The party has never been very active on the island, mainly because it was overshadowed by the significant presence of the AGBU, affiliated with ADL Ramgavar. Both organisations lost a substantial number of followers, when they \\"repatriated\\" to Armenia between 1962–1964, as part of the nerkaght (ներգաղթ – repatriation) movement and when they realized that what was promised was not real. The youngest Armenian political party in Cyprus is SDHP Hunchakian, which was set up on the island in 2005, following the split within the AGBU, which was brought about by the decision to close the Melkonian Educational Institute. It must be noted, though, that as Cyprus was frequently used as a stepping stone for some European Armenian fedayees who had Asia Minor and Cilicia as their final destination during the late 19th century and the early 20th century, a small number of the party's members temporarily stayed on the island during those times. SDHP Hunchakian is affiliated with the Nor Serount Cultural Association in Nicosia. The Armenian-Cypriot community has been actively engaged in Panarmenian issues, such as the organisation of demonstrations and other forms of protest on matters that pertain to all Armenians. Other than promoting awareness and recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which is more extensively examined below, the Armenian-Cypriot community has been lobbying successfully in favour of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, as a result of which Cypriot politicians and EuroMPs are sympathetic towards its existence. During the last decade, the Armenian-Cypriot community was actively involved in the movement to raise awareness on the unilateral closure of the Melkonian Educational Institute by the AGBU (2004–2005), the Armenia-Turkey protocols and the extradition of Ramil Safarov to Azerbaijan (2012), as well as in events commemorating Hrant Dink's memory, organised every year since his murder in 2007. Finally, in recent years the Armenian-Cypriot community has been providing financial and humanitarian aid to Armenians in need around the world: it has provided assistance to earthquake-stricken Armenians in Armenia, after the 1988 earthquake, to orphans in Nagorno-Karabakh, to Armenians in Lebanon, Armenians in Greece and Armenians in Syria, as well as to Armenians in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, through the \\"Hayastan\\" All-Armenian Fund. =Armenian Genocide recognition= Armenian Genocide memorial service with the participation of Greek-Cypriot politicians (2008) On the level of the ordinary people, most Cypriots are aware of the great calamity the Armenian nation suffered during 1894–1923 and have always been supportive and sympathetic towards Armenians; the Armenian Genocide refugees who remained in Cyprus were in the unique position of escaping from Ottoman Turks and living amicably amongst Turkish-Cypriots. Cyprus has been one of the pioneering countries in recognising the Armenian Genocide, when on 25 January 1965 Foreign Minister Spyros Kyprianou first raised the issue to the General Assembly of the United Nations. Prior to his powerful speech, a delegation comprising ARF Dashnaktsoutiun Bureau members Dr. Papken Papazian and Berj Missirlian, as well as Armenian National Committee of Cyprus members Anania Mahdessian and Vartkes Sinanian, handed him a memorandum urging Cyprus' support in raising the issue at the United Nations. Cyprus was also the first European country (and the second world-wide, after Uruguay) to officially recognise the Armenian Genocide. On 24 April 1975, after the determined efforts and the submission by Representative Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian, Resolution 36 was voted unanimously by the House of Representatives. Representative Aram Kalaydjian was instrumental in passing unanimously through the House of Representatives two more resolutions regarding the Armenian Genocide: Resolution 74/29–04–1982, submitted by the Foreign Relations' Parliamentary Committee, and Resolution 103/19–04–1990, submitted by all parliamentary parties. Resolution 103 declared 24 April as a National Remembrance Day of the Armenian Genocide in Cyprus. Since 1965, when Cypriot government officials started participating in the annual Armenian Genocide functions, Cyprus' political leaders are often keynote speakers in those functions organised to commemorate the Armenian Genocide. Over the last years, there is usually a march starting from the centre of Nicosia and ending at the Virgin Mary church in Strovolos, where a commemorative event takes place in front of the Armenian Genocide Monument; other events also take place, such as blood donations. Social life The Armenian-Cypriot community has traditionally had an active and structured social life. Various charity, cultural, educational and social events are organised, such as fund- raisers/bazaars, art/book exhibitions, dancing/theatre performances, balls, lunches, film screenings, camps/excursions in Cyprus and abroad (panagoum), as well as lectures and commemoration ceremonies regarding Armenia, Nagorno- Karabakh, the Armenian Diaspora and the Armenian Genocide. The main venue for community events is the AYMA club and the \\"Vahram Utidjian\\" Hall, at the basement of the Armenian Prelature building, both in Strovolos, Nicosia. In the past, numerous events were organised at the Melkonian Educational Institute in Aglandjia, the hall of the Armenian Club in Nicosia or the hall of the old AGBU club in Nicosia. School events take place at the open amphitheatre or the newly built auditorium of Nicosia's Nareg Armenian School. More recently, some community events have been organised at the Larnaca Armenian Club or Limassol's Armenian church hall. =Notable organisations= * AYMA [Armenian Young Men's Association/Հայ Երիտասարդաց Միութիւն (Hay Yeridasartats Mioutiun)]. Established by a group of young Armenian men in Nicosia in October 1934, it is the leading Armenian-Cypriot club and the centre of the social, sports and cultural life of the Armenian-Cypriot community. After it was housed in various rented places, it acquired its own club house in 1961 in Tanzimat street, purchased for the sum of £6,000. As the club house was taken over during the 1963–1964 intercommunal violence, AYMA fell in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area, as was the rest of the historical Armenian Quarter of Nicosia. It was then housed in various rented places. Its own premises, built between 1985–1986 by architects Marios & Nicos Santamas, are located at the corner of Alasia and Valtetsi streets, near the Virgin Mary church in Strovolos, Nicosia, on land leased by the government (Decision of the Council of Ministers 21.188/17–12–1981), and were inaugurated on 30 May 1987 by President Spyros Kyprianou. There is a well-organised library room at the club house. Its renovated and expanded functions hall was inaugurated on 28 February 2010 by Representative Vartkes Mahdessian. AYMA is affiliated with the Homenetmen Panarmenian organisation. * Armenian Youth Federation of Cyprus [Կիպրոսի Երիտասարդական Միութիւն (Gibrosi Yeridasartagan Mioutiun), 1977]. It edifies children, teenagers and young adults. * Armenian Relief Society of Cyprus [Հայ Օգնութեան Միութիւն (Hay Oknoutian Mioutiun), also known as HOM (ՀՕՄ), \\"Sosse\\" chapter, 1988]. It is a women's charity organization, which sends help to Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian Diaspora and local charity organisations. * Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Association of Cyprus [Համազգային Հայ Կրթական եւ Մշակութային Միութիւն (Hamazkayin Hay Grtagan yev Mshagoutayin Mioutiun), \\"Oshagan\\" chapter, 1999]. It organizes various cultural events, such as dance and theatre performances, art exhibitions, lectures etc. Legal status and representation The Armenian Representatives, 1960–2013 With the Independence of Cyprus, on 16 August 1960, under Article 2 § 3 of the Constitution, Armenians, and Catholics (both Marionite and Roman Catholic) were recognised as \\"religious groups\\". In the referendum held on 13 November 1960, all three religious groups opted to belong to the co-religious Greek-Cypriot community (as it was expected), something which consequently defined their political options in the game of inter-communal controversy and somewhat affected their relations with the Turkish-Cypriots, who in turn viewed them as an extension of the Greek-Cypriot political choices. This is why the religious groups were affected similarly during the crisis of 1963–1964 and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Article 110 § 3 recognises the administrative autonomy of the religious groups' Churches, as it was established with the Hatt-ı Hümayun in 1856. According to Article 111, the three Churches retain their powers regarding matters of personal status. Law 95/1989 transferred the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to the family courts, the configuration of which was defined by Law 87(I)/1994; of the three religious groups, only the Armenians participate in their workings. In accordance with the provisions of Article 109 of the Constitution, Armenian-Cypriots were given political representation: as a result of their choice to belong to the Greek-Cypriot community, an Armenian and a Latin participated in the Nicosia members of the Greek Communal Chamber, while a Maronite participated in the Kyrenia members (Colonial Law 36/1959, Colonial Law 6/1960 and Greek Communal Chamber Law 8/1960). The two Communal Chambers, which acted as a Lower Parliament, had jurisdiction over all religious, educational, cultural and other affairs of communal nature (Article 87). With the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the common state in 1963 and the self-dissolution of the Greek Communal Chamber in 1965, it was decided to transfer the executive powers of the Greek Communal Chamber to the newly formed Ministry of Education and its legislative powers to the House of Representatives (Law 12/1965). According to the Decision of the Council of Ministers 4.907/29–07–1965, it was decided that the three Representatives would provisionally continue to represent their communities in the House on issues pertaining to the jurisdiction of their Chamber and that the House was to request their opinion before legislating on pertinent matters (Law 12/1965). In order to approximate the tenure of the other MPs, the term of the three Representatives was annually extended (Law 45/1965, Law 49/1966, Law 50/1967, Law 87/1968 and Law 58/1969). The status of the three Representatives in the House of Representatives was confirmed with Law 58/1970 and furthermore specified with Law 38/1976, Law 41/1981 and Law 66(I)/2011. Since 1991, the elections for the three Representatives have been held simultaneously and in parallel with the general parliamentary elections and the Representatives' term is identical with that of the proper MPs (Law 70/1986). The Representatives act as liaisons between their communities and the state and they are par excellence competent to bring before the state all issues relating to their group. Their participation has a 5-year duration and a consultative character, as although they can express their views on matters relating to their group, they do not have the right to vote. Especially in the case of the Armenians, the Representative delivers a speech about the Armenian Genocide during the plenary session of the House convened on or near 24 April each year. So far, six (6) Armenian Representatives have served: Berge Tilbian from Nicosia (1960–1970), Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian from Nicosia (1970–1982), Aram Kalaydjian from Larnaca (1982–1995), Bedros Kalaydjian from Larnaca (1995–2005), Dr. Vahakn Atamyan from Nicosia (2005–2006) and Vartkes Mahdessian from Nicosia (2006–today). Since 1998, the elected Representative is ex officio member of the Diocesan Council (Թեմական Ժողով) of the Armenian Ethnarchy (Ազգային Իշխանութիւն). Elections The first elections for the Armenian member of the Greek Communal Chamber took place on 5 August 1960 between Vahram Levonian and Berge Tilbian, who was elected after receiving 60.49% (1,364 votes). Between 1965–1970, the term of office for the Armenian, the Maronite and the Latin Representatives was extended by special laws, until Law 58/1970 was enacted, properly including them in the House of Representatives. The second elections were held on 19 July 1970 between Berge Tilbian and Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian, who was elected after receiving 56.30% (590 votes); Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian was re-elected on 3 October 1976, with Aram Kalaydjian as his opponent, after receiving 50.96% (612 votes). The next elections were held on 14 March 1982 between Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian and Aram Kalaydjian, who secured 58.36% (771 votes); Aram Kalaydjian was re-elected on 13 July 1986, with Anna Ashdjian as his opponent, after securing 65.08% (792 votes), and again on 19 May 1991, again winning over Anna Ashdjian and receiving 67.00% (875 votes). Because of Aram Kalaydjian's death on 10 September 1995, a by-election was held on 22 October 1995, between Kevork Mahdessian and Bedros Kalaydjian, who won with 60.34% (849 votes). Bedros Kalaydjian was re-elected on 26 May 1996, securing 73.91% (997 votes) against Anna Ashdjian and again on 27 May 2001, receiving 57.13% (857 votes) against Dr. Garabed Khatcho-Kazandjian. Because of Bedros Kalaydjian's death on 1 September 2005, a by-election was held on 9 October 2005, with Dr. Vahakn Atamyan receiving 52.03% (769 votes) against Dr. Antranik Ashdjian (43.91%) and Parsegh Zartarian (4.12%). The next elections took place on 21 May 2006, with Vartkes Mahdessian receiving 52.60% (899 votes) against Dr. Vahakn Atamyan. The most recent elections were held on 22 May 2011, with Mahdessian securing 67.67% (1,105 votes) against Dr. Antranik Ashdjian. Although not elected, the Armenians in Nicosia also have a mukhtar, appointed by the Ministry of Interior. The first mukhtar was Melik Melikian (1927–1949), succeeded by Kasbar Delyfer (1949–1956) and Vahe Kouyoumdjian (1956–2009). As of 1 January 2011, the current Armenian mukhtar is Mgo Kouyoumdjian. Religion Like most communities of the Armenian Diaspora, the Armenian- Cypriot community is predominantly Armenian Apostolic (about 95%). Some 5% belong either to the Armenian Evangelical Church, Armenian Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Church, Greek Orthodox Church, Anglican Church, Plymouth Brethren Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church or they are Jehovah's Witnesses; of this 5%, historically the most significant groups have been Armenian Evangelicals, who in the 1940s and 1950s comprised about 10% of the Armenian- Cypriot community, and Armenian-Catholics, who have been on the island since the time of the Crusades. =Armenian Prelature of Cyprus= The building of the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus in Strovolos, Nicosia The Armenian Prelature of Cyprus was established in 973 by Catholicos Khatchig I. Historically, the Prelature has been under the jurisdiction of the Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia, while today it is the oldest theme that falls under its jurisdiction. Since 2014 the Prelate, a Catholicosal Vicar General, has been Archbishop Nareg Alemezian. The parish priest in Nicosia is Fr. Momik Habeshian, while the parish priest in Larnaca and Limassol is Fr. Mashdots Ashkarian. For centuries, the Prelature building was located within the Armenian compound in Victoria street in walled Nicosia; when that area was taken over by Turkish-Cypriot extremists in 1963–1964, the Prelature was temporarily housed in Aram Ouzounian street and, later on, in Kyriakos Matsis street in Ayios Dhometios. Thanks to the efforts of Bishop Zareh Aznavorian and with financial aid from the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, the new Prelature building was erected in 1983, next to the Sourp Asdvadzadzin church and the Nareg school in Nicosia, by architects Athos Dikaios & Alkis Dikaios; it was officially inaugurated on 4 March 1984, during the pastoral visit of Catholicos Karekin II. By initiative of Archbishop Varoujan Hergelian, in 1998 the basement of the building was renovated and the \\"Vahram Utidjian\\" Hall was formed; previously a store room, it became a reality from the proceeds of the auction in 1994 of the art collection that Vahram Utidjian had donated to the Prelature in 1954. It was inaugurated on 3 February 1999 by Catholicos Aram I; numerous charity, communal and cultural events take place there. The Prelature's consistory houses a collection of ecclesiastical relics, some of which were previously in the old Notre Dame de Tyre church or the Magaravank. =Armenian Evangelical Church= The first Armenian Evangelicals in Cyprus came after the arrival of the British in July 1878. As they were not committed, and very few, they quickly became associated with the Armenian Apostolic Church. With the influx of more Protestants, Armenian Evangelicals became affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church as early as 1887. In 1933, the newly formed Cyprus Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church divided its congregations into Armenian and Greek councils. Armenian Evangelicals were granted provisional autonomy from the Reformed Presbyterian Mission in 1954, which was formalised in 1962. In Larnaca, Armenian Evangelicals dwindled after the inter-communal troubles of 1963–1964, services were no longer held; in Nicosia, the Armenian Evangelical church fell into Turkish-Cypriot control during the inter-communal troubles and so services were then held at the American Academy chapel until 1973. After nearly 30 years of inactivity, by initiative of Nouvart Kassouni-Panayiotides and Lydia Gulesserian and with the help of Hrayr Jebejian, Executive Secretary of the Bible Society in the Gulf Armenian Evangelicals were re-organised at the Greek Evangelical church in Larnaca in 2002. Since 2005, when Hrayr Jebejian moved to Cyprus, services are held every few months at the Greek Evangelical church in Nicosia. Also, the Armenian Evangelical Church organizes a few lectures in Nicosia. =Armenian Catholic Church= The Bellapais Abbey (early 20th century) Armenian-Catholics first came to the island during the Frankish Era from the nearby Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. It is unclear whether they had their own structure during the Latin Era or if they were under the Latin Church of Cyprus, as has been the case since the Ottoman Era. During the Ottoman Era, there was a very limited conversion of Armenian Orthodox to Catholicism, mainly due to the proselytising activities of the Franciscan mission in Nicosia and Larnaca, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries; however, these must have been temporary apostasies and their number never exceeded 50 at any given time. In 1794 the small Armenian Catholic community of Larnaca was granted some holy chalices from the auction of the belongings of the old Capuchin monastery of the town. It was during the British Era that the Armenian-Catholic community increased in number, due to the arrival of a large number of refugees from the Armenian genocide. In 1931, there were about 200 Armenian-Catholics in Cyprus most of them became attached to the Latin places of worship, especially the Holy Cross cathedral in Nicosia and Saint Joseph's convent in Larnaca; between 1921-1923, the latter housed a small Armenian-Catholic school, run by Abbot Jean Kouyoumdjian - who served at the convent between 1921-1928. In 1960, there were less than 100 Armenian- Catholics. However, their number decreased in the following years, due to emigration to other countries and assimilation with the Armenian-Cypriot, the Latin-Cypriot and/or the Greek-Cypriot community. However, due to the influx of Lebanese-Armenians to Cyprus since the mid-1970s, there has been a small increase in the number of Armenian-Catholics on the island. Currently, local Armenian-Catholics are less than 20, in addition to about 30 foreign Armenians. Places of worship The Armenian compound in Strovolos, location of the Virgin Mary cathedral, Nareg Armenian school and the Armenian Genocide Monument in Nicosia There are five Armenian Orthodox churches in Cyprus, two in the capital Nicosia (one in the north) and one in each Larnaca, Limassol and Famagusta. Additionally, there are three Armenian chapels in the vicinity of Nicosia and one within the Magaravank complex, the latter in the north. There is also an Armenian Evangelical church in North Nicosia. Finally, there is the renowned Magaravank in the north. Education Armenians have always attached particular emphasis in education, which – in conjunction with the Church – is the foundation for the preservation of their national and cultural heritage. Armenian schools teach Armenology, which includes Armenian history and traditions, ensuring the perpetuation of Armenianism from generation to generation. Monuments The Armenian-Cypriot community has several historical monuments, including the Armenian Genocide Monument in Nicosia and a mortar obelisk dedicated to Abbot Mekhitar. The Armenian Quarter The original Armenian quarter (13th - late 15th/early 16th century) may have been located in the eastern part of Frankish Nicosia and that Armenians acquired their new quarter within the 16th century. After the conquest of the city in 1570, the Ottomans renamed the extant Armenian quarter to \\"Karamanzade mahallesi\\" (literally: quarter of the son of Karaman), in honour of one of the Generals who took part in the conquest of Cyprus and came from Karaman Eyalet. From the 16th century to December 1963, the western part of walled Nicosia formed what was known as the Armenian Quarter ( in Greek language), '( in Armenian language) or ( in Turkish language). Administratively, the Armenian Quarter included both the Karaman Zade quarter and the Arab Ahmed Pasha quarter. After the British Empire gained control of Cyprus from the Ottoman Empire, this part of the city housed several British officers. Their presence, together with that of the Latins, gave it the unofficial Greek name for \\"Levantine Quarter\\". The first hotels of Nicosia opened on Victoria street during this time, including the \\"Armenian Hotel\\" (c. 1875- c. 1925) and the \\"Army and Navy Hotel\\" (1878 - c. 1890), resulting in the first cutting of the Venetian walls at the end of Victoria street. The heart of the Armenian quarter was Victoria street (Վիքթորիա փողոց/οδός Βικτωρίας/Viktorya sokağı), in which the Armenian compound was located, as well as many houses and, at a later time, the AGBU club house; at times, AYMA's club house was there as well. Victoria street was the road that every Armenian-Cypriot would walk on to go to church, to school, to the clubs, to visit family, relatives and friends etc. One could see all the time Armenian-Cypriots walking around the narrow streets amidst a profusion of Oriental smells and a chatter in Armenian. The street, full of beautiful ashlar buildings, started from the Latin church of the Holy Cross and ended at the Arab Ahmed Pasha mosque, having Mahmoud Pasha street as its extension (where the American Academy Nicosia was between 1922-1955 and the Armenian Evangelical church since 1946). As it was a one-way street, traffic was only allowed from the north to the south. During the Cypriot intercommunal violence, a large part of the Armenian Quarter of Nicosia was gradually taken over by Turkish Cypriots between 21 December 1963 and 19 January 1964. Most Armenian-Cypriots left their homes during this time, while other families stayed for a longer period in tents at the grounds of the Melkonian Educational Institute. The Armenian quarter was also home to many Turkish Cypriots, as well as some Greek-Cypriots, Maronite- Cypriots, Roman Catholic Cypriots and British nationals.

Tonaries often include Office antiphons, the mode of which determines the recitation formula for the accompanying text (the psalm tone if the antiphon is sung with a psalm, or canticle tone if the antiphon is sung with a canticle), but a tonary may also or instead list responsories or Mass chants not associated with formulaic recitation. Although some tonaries are stand-alone works, they were frequently used as an appendix to other liturgical books such as antiphonaries, graduals, tropers, and prosers, and are often included in collections of musical treatises.  Function and form  F-Pn lat. 13159, fol. 167r) Tonaries were particularly important as part of the written transmission of plainchant, although they already changed the oral chant transmission of Frankish cantors entirely before musical notation was used systematically in fully notated chant books.The modal patterns, memorized by a short formula, and the deductive classification of chant played an active part in the process of oral transmission, so Anna Maria Busse Berger dedicated a whole chapter of her book (2005, pp. 47-84) to the tonary, in which she described the relationship between music and the medieval art of memory. Since the Carolingian reform the ordering according to the Octoechos assisted the memorization of chant. The exact order was related to the elements of the \\"tetrachord of the finales\\" (D—E—F—G) which were called \\"Protus, Deuterus, Tritus\\", and \\"Tetrardus\\". Each of them served as the finalis of two toni—the \\"authentic\\" (ascending into the higher octave) and the \\"plagal\\" one (descending into the lower fourth). The eight tones were ordered in these pairs: \\"Autentus protus, Plagi Proti, Autentus Deuterus\\" etc. Since Hucbald of Saint-Amand the eight tones were simply numbered according to this order: Tonus I-VIII. Aquitanian cantors usually used both names for each section. The earliest tonaries, written during the 8th century, were very short and simple without any visible reference to psalmody. Tonaries of the 9th century already ordered a huge repertoire of psalmodic chant into sections of psalmtone endings, even if their melody was not indicated or indicated by later added neumes.E.g. a tonary added to Aurelian's theoretical one in a manuscript of the Abbey Saint- Amand (F-VAL 148)—an important centre of the Carolingian Renaissance, has some intonation formulas in later added Paleofrankish neumes. Most of the tonaries which have survived until now can be dated back to the 11th and 12th centuries, while some were written during later centuries, especially in Germany. The treatise form usually served as a bridge between the Octoechos theory and the daily practice of prayer: memorizing and performing the liturgy as chant and reciting the psalms. This can be studied at a 10th-century treatise called Commemoratio brevis de tonis et psalmis modulandis, which used the Dasia-signs of the Musica enchiriadis treatise (9th century) in order to transcribe the melodic endings or terminations of psalmody.An early copy of the Commemoratio brevis in a music theory collection written about 1000 (D-BAs Var.1). A list of the sources can be found here: 11th-century theorists like Guido of Arezzo (Regulae rhythmicae) or Hermann of Reichenau (Musica) refused the Dasia tone system, because it displayed tetraphonic tone system and not the systema teleion (corresponding to the white keys of the keyboard) which had all the pitches needed for the \\"melos of the echoi\\" (ex sonorum copulatione in \\"Musica enchiriadis\\", emmelis sonorum in the compilation \\"alia musica\\").Both systems were used by Byzantine psaltes and among them the former was never expected to contain all the degrees of the mode, as they were used \\"in the melos of the echoi\\". Nevertheless, the first example of the eighth chapter in Musica enchiriadis, called \\"Quomodo ex quatuor Sonorum vi omnes toni producantur\\", already used the fifth of the Protus (D—a) for an illustration, how alleluia melodies are developed by the use of the intonation formula for the \\"Autentus protus\\".See the copy from the Abbey St. Emmeram (D-Mbs clm 14272, fol.156). = The different forms of a tonary = Tonaries can differ substantially in length and shape: * As a treatise they usually describe the octave, fifth and fourth species of each tone, but also their modal characteristics like microtonal shifts or the change to another melodic frame. * It can also be an abridged form or breviary, which just show the sacramentary (for mass chants) or antiphonary (for the office chant of the Vigils and the Hours) according to the liturgical year. The tonus of the antiphonal chant genres is indicated by later added rubrics as \\"ATe\\" for \\"Autentus Tetrardus\\" (see the Gradual-Sacramentaries of Corbie and Saint- Denis) or the Roman Ordinals I-VIII according to Hucbald's system, as we can find it in the early Troper-Sequentiary of St. Géraud in Aurillac (F-Pn lat. 1084) and the abridged Antiphonary of St. Martial (F-Pn lat. 1085). * The most common form was the shortest one which had no theoretical explanation. Since the late 9th century each section started with an intonation formula and the psalmody of the mode, its pitches represented by letters or later by diastematic neume notation. Subsections followed the different chant genres quoted as examples for the represented tone. Antiphonal refrains in psalm recitation (antiphons like introits and communiones), usually represented by its text incipit, were sorted according to various terminations used in psalmody, the so-called \\"differentiae\\".The practice of differentiae, terminations which were also called \\"divisio, diffinitio\\", or \\"formula\\", corresponded to the melodic beginning of the antiphons and was developed during the later 9th century. Hence, the different terminations of psalmody became a subsection of each section dedicated to the antiphons of the mass or the nocturn. There are tonaries which exemplified the whole psalmody with the small doxology (\\"Gloria patri\\") written out with neumes or letters (see the Dasia-signs used in D-BAs Var.1), but there was also the abridged form to notate just the termination over the vowels EVOVAE of the last six syllables: \\"seculorum. Amen.\\" Often the eight sections for the eight tones were repeated for other chant genres without psalmody or different chant books as gradual and antiphonary (Responsories, Alleluia, Offertories etc.). * A very rare form of tonary is a fully notated one, which shows every chant genre (not only the antiphonal ones with psalmody as introit and communio of the proper mass) ordered according to its tonus. A very famous example is the full tonary for mass chant by Abbot William of Volpiano, written for his Abbey St. Benignus of Dijon (F-MOf H.159). = The tonary's function in chant transmission = During the Carolingian reform the tonary played a key role in the organization and the transfer of Roman chant, which had to be sung by Frankish cantors according to Charlemagne's admonitio generalis after it was decreed in 789. The historical background was the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 during which Pope Adrian I accepted the Eastern Octoechos reform also for the Roman church. Fully notated neume manuscripts like the gradual and the antiphonary were written much later during the last decades of the 10th century, and the oral transmission of Gregorian chant is only testified by additions of neumes in sacramentaries. In the tonary the whole repertory of \\"Gregorian chant\\" was ordered according to its modal classification of the Octoechos. Michel Huglo developed in his dissertation the hypothesis about an original tonary which preceded the Metz tonary and the tonary of St. Riquier.Huglo (1971). It was probably a coincidence, that Pope Adrian I supported the Eastern Octoechos reform, but it is also evident that Carolingian diplomates present at the synode did not get interest in the communication of the modes by intonations called enechemata for the first time.In a long essay dedicated to the Latin treatises and the knowledge that Latin cantors had about music theory, Michel Huglo (2000) referred to an episode of a Byzantine legacy in Aachen, who celebrated troparia (processional antiphons) for the feast of Epiphany. Oliver Strunk (1960) had already published about this visit, but through Walter Berschin's essays about the Carolingian visits of Byzantine legacies Michel Huglo became convinced that this exchange could already have happened before his self-nomination as an Emperor of both Roman Empires. Nevertheless, it was the difference between Greek and Latin chant sources and especially the particular function of the tonary in chant transmission, which led Peter Jeffery to the conclusion, that the huge repertoire of Roman chant was classified according to the Octoechos a posteriori.Jeffery (2001). While early manuscripts of Greek chant always used modal signatures (even before neume notation was used), the fully notated graduals and antiphonaries of the first generation (10th century), written by Frankish cantors, report a lot of details about accentuation and ornamentation, but the melodic structure was remembered orally by tropes. Sometimes a tonary was attached to these manuscripts, and the cantors could use it by looking for the incipit of an antiphon in question (e.g. an introit to communio), in order to find the right psalmody according to the mode and the melodic ending of the antiphon, which was sung as a refrain during the recitation of the psalm. A Greek psaltes would sing a completely different melody according to the echos indicated by the modal signature, while Frankish cantors had to remember the melody of a certain Roman chant, before they communicated their idea of its mode and its psalmody in a tonary—for all the cantors who will follow them. In this complex process of chant transmission, which followed Charlemagne's reform, the so- called \\"Gregorian chant\\" or Franco-Roman chant, as it was written down about 150 years after the reform, was born. The tonary's function within chant transmission explains, why local schools of Latin chant can be studied by their tonary. Hence, the tonary was still substantial for every chant reform between the 10th and the 12th centuries, like the reform of the Cluniac Monastic Association (tonaries of Aquitania, Paris, and Fleury,The impact of the Cluniac Monastic Association on these reforms was often considered, neglected, and re-considered by various musicologists. Background was a discussion among historians around a book of Dominique Iogna-Prat, which was originally published in French in 1998 (see the English translation by Graham Robert Edwards: ). The answer of the musicologist's question concerning the centre of the Aquitanian school laid simply there. Rather lately (2006) Bryan Gillingham tried a general study of the role that Cluny played in the written chant transmission between the 11th and the 13th century. Already in 1985 Jacques Chailley studied an allegorical sculpture in the sanctuary of Cluny Abbey which is an important monument of the Cluniac approach to the tonary and its eight-mode system, according to him the sanctuary with the sculpture was inaugurated by Pope Urban II. but also in Northern SpainThe Taifa kingdom Toledo, an important domaine of the Mozarabic rite, was conquered by the Castilian King Alfonso VI in 1085. After he gave his daughters in marriage to Aquitanian und Burgundian aristocrats, the Council of Burgos had already decreed the introduction of the Roman rite in 1080. Hence, reforms can be studied by the distribution of Aquitanian manuscripts in Spain. See also the study of chant manuscripts by Manuel Ferreira (2007).), the reform of a monastic orders like the one around Bernard of Clairvaux for the Cistercians (Tonale Sci Bernardi), a papal reform, like Abbot Desiderius realized at the Abbey Montecassino (Tonary of Montecassino), or the reform of some monasteries of a certain region, as Abbot William of Volpiano did for certain Abbeys in Burgundy and Normandy (William of Volpiano's Toner-Gradual and Antiphonary).  The Carolingian names or \\"Byzantine\\" intonations for the 8 tones  In Carolingian times each of the eight sections was opened by an intonation formula using the names like \\"Nonannoeane\\" for the authentic and \\"Noeagis\\" or \\"Noeais\\" for the plagal tones. In the living traditions of Orthodox chant, these formulas were called \\"enechemata\\" and they were used by a protopsaltes to communicate the basis tone for the ison-singers (a kind of bordun) as well as the first note of the chant for the other singers.It is not easy to prove this or another practice for medieval chant, neither for Greek nor for Latin singers, but concerning performance practice this is quite a controversial topic which is solved in different ways. It is possible that the Orthodox practice today helps the singers to sing subtle intonation changes, which are no longer practiced in Western music, while maqam singers usually sing without ison. It is as well possible to perform florid organa in a monodic way without the cantus in the tenor as a second voice. In his theoretical tonary \\"Musica disciplina\\", Aurelian of Réôme asked a Greek about the meaning of the intonation syllables used in Latin tonaries: > My mind was usually moved by some of the names, which were inscribed for the > tones, as \\"Nonan[no]eane\\" for the protus, and \\"Noeane\\" for the deuterus. Did > they have any significance? So I asked a Greek, how these could be > translated into Latin. He answered that they did not mean anything, but they > were rather expressions of joy. And the greater the harmony of the voice, > the more syllables were inscribed to the tone: as in the \\"authentus protus\\" > which was the first, they used six syllables as \\"No[neno]eane\\" or > \\"Nonannoeane\\"; for \\"authentus tritus\\", which was smaller in measure [not so > much worth], five syllables as \\"Noioeane\\" were inscribed. In plagal tones > the letters were similar to \\"Noeane\\", as \\"Noeacis\\" according to them. When I > asked him, if there might be something similar in our language, the Greek > added, that I should rather think of something expressed by charioteers or > ploughing peasants, when their voice had nothing else than this joy. The > same contained the modulation of the tones [during their intonation]. The practice of using abstract syllables for the intonation, as it was common for the use of enechemata among Byzantine psaltes, was obviously not familiar to Aurelian of Réôme.It was a coincidence that Carolingian cantors used more syllables for the Autentus protus, like the enechema of the echos protos as it was used by Greek psaltes (see Octoechos). It was probably imported by a Byzantine legacy, when they introduced the Greek Octoechos by a series of procession antiphons used for the feast of Epiphany.Huglo (2000). Although the Latin names were not identical, there is some resemblance between the intonation formula of the echos plagios tetartos νὲ ἅγιε and the Latin name \\"Noeagis\\", used as a general name for all four plagal tones. But there are some more obvious cases as particular names like \\"Aianeoeane\\" (enechema of the Mesos Tetartos) or \\"Aannes\\" (enechema of the echos varys) which can be found in very few tonaries between Liège, Paris, Fleury, and Chartres. Two of these tonaries have treatises and use a lot of Greek terms taken from Ancient Greek theory.For example in the 11th-century treatise compilation \\"alia musica\\" (Chailley 1965, \\"AIANEOEANE\\": p.141; \\"AANNES\\": p.160), and some tonaries are of particular interest as Hartvic's copy of the Chartres tonary and the second tonary of the Troper-Sequentiary of Reichenau, which uses \\"ANANEAGIES\\" for the \\"Autenticus Protus\\" and \\"AIANEAGIES\\" for the \\"Autenticus Deuterus\\". Unlike the Guidonian concept of \\"b fa\\", the plagios tritos which was called echos varys (\\"grave mode\\") by Greek psaltes, did not avoid the tritone to the basis and finalis F. The pure fourth was only used by the enharmonic phthora nana. According to Oliver Gerlach (2012) the very sophisticated intonation of the diatonic Mesos Tetartos, known by the name ἅγια νεανὲ among Greek psaltes, was imitated by Latin cantors for certain phrygian compositions of the Gregorian repertory, among them the Communio Confessio et pulchritudo. Michel Huglo (NGrove) classified these tonaries as \\"transitional group\\" which he dated already to the 10th century.  The later practice of the intonation verses  Dasia signs (D-BAs Ms. Msc.Var.1, fol. 44r) The oldest tonaries, especially the Carolingian like those of St. Riquier, Metz, Reichenau and the earliest tonary in a troper of Limoges (F-Pn lat. 1240), only used the so-called \\"Byzantine\\" intonation formulas, as they were discussed by Aurelian of Réôme (Musica disciplina), Regino of Prüm (Tonarius), and Berno of Reichenau (Tonarium).The verses inserted before the tonary of Reichenau are obviously a later addition: This version has very elaborated neumae after each verse. But since the 10th century, also biblical verses were used. They were composed together in one antiphon with each verse changing the tone and referring to the number of the tonus according to the system of Hucbald (Tonus primus, secundus, terius etc.), similar to Guido of Arezzo's use of the solmization hymn \\"Ut queant laxis\\". They were several different antiphons as they can be found in the Hartker-Antiphonary or the treatise collection of Montecassino (Ms. Q318, p. 122-125), but no one became so popular than a compilation of verses taken from the New Testament which started with \\"Primum querite regnum dei\\".A list of a lot of tonaries which use these verses, can be found here: Usually each verse is finished by a long melisma or neuma which clearly show its potential to become a tool of improvisation and composition as well. The origin of these verses is unknown. In some tonaries, they replaced the Carolingian intonations as in the tonary by Berno of Reichenau, but more often they were written under them or alternated with them in the subsections like in a certain group which Michel Huglo (1971) called the \\"Toulouse tonaries\\" (F-Pn lat. 776, 1118, GB-Lbl Ms. Harley 4951), but also in the tonary of Montecassino. Concerning the earliest fully notated chant manuscripts, it seems that the practice of singing the intonation formulas was soon replaced by another practice, that a soloist intoned the beginning of an antiphon, responsorium, or alleluia, and after this \\"incipit\\" of the soloist the choir continued. These changes between precantor and choir were usually indicated by an asterisk or by the use of maiuscula at the beginning the chant text. The psalmody could be indicated by an incipit of the required psalm and the differentia notated over the syllables EVOVAE after the communio or introit antiphon.  Cross-references between tonaries during the reforms between the 10th and the 13th centuries  Nevertheless, the tonary was not replaced by these manuscripts. While the first generation of notated manuscripts became less and less readable until the end of the 10th century, the production of tonaries as useful appendix highly increased, especially in Aquitania, the Loire valley (Île-de-France) and Burgundy. Probably the oral tradition of the melody was no longer properly working since the early 11th century, or there was still a need in a lot of regions to teach certain cantors an unknown tradition, or the tradition itself had to change under certain innovations of cantors who were in charge of an institutional reform. Studies of the reforms of various regions in Spain, Germany, Italy, and France have found evidence for all these cases whatever was the centre of each reform which had taken place between the late 10th and the 12th centuries. The monk Hartvic added some Dasia signs for certain differentiae as a kind of rubric or comment on the margin (Tonary of St. Emmeram, Regensburg). He knew them from the treatises Musica and Scholica enchiriadis which he copied in this manuscript, and thus he discovered a new way of using them: as an additional explanation or second pitch notation interpreting the adiastematic neumes. F-Pn lat. 1118, fol. 105v = The Cluniac reforms and the counter-reforms = During the late 10th and the 11th century, the early use of a second alphabetical pitch notation was soon replaced by a new diastematic form of neume notation, which indicated the pitch by the vertical position of the neumes, while their groups indicated by ligatures were still visible. Aquitanian and English cantors in Winchester were the first who developed a diastematic form, which could be written in such an analytical way.  William of Volpiano and the Norman line  William of Volpiano elaborated the concept of an additional letter notation and created a new form of tonary which became an important part of his monastic reforms, he did the first reform for Cluny, after he became abbot of St. Benignus of Dijon in Burgundy. Since 1001 he changed to the Abbey of Fécamp, after he was asked by the Norman Duke Richard II to guide secular and monastic reforms in the Duchy of Normandy. The fully notated tonary which he wrote for St. Benignus (F-MOf H159), is following the order of other tonaries, which were created under the influence of the Cluniac Monastic Association.The Cluniac reforms can be verified in tonaries written in Cluny and Fleury Abbey, certain Abbeys around Paris as Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, Saint-Denis, but also in Burgundy and Aquitaine. The creativity of Aquitanian cantors played a key role concerning the Cluniac needs for an extravagant liturgy. Hence, it is hardly surprising that they were more productive concerning tonaries than any other local school in Europe. These tonaries usually had sections dedicated to the antiphonary and the gradual, within the gradual and the antiphonary there were subsections like the antiphons which were sung as refrains during psalm recitation (introits and communions), responsories (the introduction of epistle readings), but also other genres of the proper mass chant as alleluia verses (the introduction of gospels), and offertories (a soloistic processional antiphon for the procession of the gifts). Several Aquitanian troper-sequentiaries had a libellum structure which sorted the genres in separate books like alleluia verses (as the first part of sequentiaries and tractus collections), offertorials, and tropers. But William of Volpiano subdivided these books into eight parts according to the octoechos system like the tonary, or the troparia in the Byzantine book Octoechos, and within these sections the chant was ordered according to the cycle of the liturgical year starting with advent. He used the neumes of Cluny, the central French forms, without changing them, but he added an own system of alphabetic notation in a second row, which defined the pitches of the melody precisely according to the Boethian diagramm.See Huglo's study of this particular tonary (1956). Including the enharmonic diesis which were represented by signs as \\"Τ\\" for E diesis, \\"Γ\\" for b diesis, and the last sign written from the right to the left for a diesis (see the figure in the main article). The Boethian diagramm was already used since centuries, with exception of the symbols of the tetraphonic Dasia system which were used in certain treatises since the Musica and Scolica enchiriadis (Phillips 2000). Like any other chant manuscript around 1000, the book was not written for a use during a ceremony, it was a \\"book of memory\\" for cantors who alone had the competence of reading and writing neumes, and the responsibility to organize the chant sung during the liturgical year. During his reforms, several Abbeys followed his example and his system was used by the teachers of the local grammar schools which included the daily practice of singing the liturgy. Sequentiary from Aquitaine, end 10th century (F-Pn lat. 1118, fol. 114r) William's reform and its monastic foundations of Fécamp and the construction of the Abbey on the island of Mont Saint-Michel were not the first, and there were a lot of later abbots who founded monasteries not only in Normandy, Olivier Diard's study (2000) of a late copy of his tonary and antiphonary for the Abbey of Fécamp (Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale, Ms. 254, olim A.190) emphasized that William of Volpiano had not only introduced customs of Saint Bénigne and own compositions — as it was common among Cluniac reformers — in Normandy, but he also integrated and reinforced Norman customs by his school. but also in the conquered territories of Northern, and Southern Italy, including Arabian Sicily, after the Norman Kingdom was established in the conquered Island. His fully notated tonaries were only copied in Brittany and Normandy, the Norman-Sicilian manuscripts rather imitated the libellum structure of the Aquitanian troper-sequentiaries, and only a few of them (E-Mn 288, F-Pn lat. 10508) have survived with a tonary using central French neume notation, in its style very close to the chant books of Cluny.About the Sicilian origin of the tonary in the Troper-Proser of the Saint-Évroult Abbey, see Shin Nishimagi (2008). The «Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Médecin» still conserves the only manuscript with alphabetic notation which can be dated back to William's time. Thanks to the creative and innovative achievements of William as a cantor, reformer and architect, the local monasteries which he reformed, did not simply adapt to customs of the Cluniac reform, he contributed to the history of Norman chant his own local school which was as well inspired by elements of the local Norman tradition as by innovations of the Cluniac reform.  The Aquitanian tonaries and the Winchester Troper  The Aquitanian innovation can be traced back to a very prominent cantor within the Cluniac reforms: Adémar de Chabannes was educated by his uncle Roger de Chabannes at the Saint-Martial Abbey of Limoges and this school redacted the first chant manuscripts by additional modal signatures and a remarkable production of tonaries, which Michel Huglo called the \\"Saint-Martial group\\" or the monastic tonaries of Aquitaine. Adémar was the next generation after William of Volpiano and he was one of the first notators who used the diastematic form of Aquitanian neume notation, which had already been developed during the late 10th century.In his monographical study (2006) James Grier regard two manuscripts (F-Pn lat. 909 and 1121) as documents of Adémar's work as a cantor and notator. Both of them have a tonary which offer insights to the modal framework of Adémar's school according to the local concept of the octoechos. Another tonary corpus of the same region was Huglo's \\"Toulouse groupe\\" around the Gradual of the Saint- Étienne cathedral in Toulouse (GB-Lbl Ms. Harley 4951, F-Pn lat. 1118, and 776). All of these books of the local secular cathedral rite have a tonary libellum. The oldest one is the Troper Sequentiary of the Auch region (F-Pn lat. 1118) which was probably written in Limoges by the end of the 10th century. The intonation of the \\"plagi protus\\" (on folio 105 verso) is rather exposing the melos used in Old Roman chant of this tone (ranging between C and G), but the sequentiary (folio 114 recto) is opened by an \\"improvised\\" alleluia of the same tone simply made by a similar intonation which is also using the plagal fourth A-D under the final note D according to the Carolingian concept of the plagal mode. On folio 131 verso there is another alleluia made of the same intonation, but here the same intonation is rather artificially cut into segments for the words of the sequence «Almifona». Here, the improvised melodic structure developed by a repetitive use of the intonation formula had turned into a sophisticated composition which dealt with the syllables of poetry.See folio 131 verso of the Troper Sequentiary. Jørgen Raasted (1988) and Oliver Gerlach (2011, pp. 22-24) emphasized this creative or poetic function in their description of Western and Eastern intonation formulas. A central line, usually on F or G, was added and helped to recognize their horizontal organization, during the 12th century a second line was added until they were replaced by a pentagramm in square notation by the second half of the 12th century.Already the Musica and Scolica enchiriadis (9th century) used rows defined by Dasian signs, and placed the syllables of the chant text according to the pitches sung with them. The odd tone system was a repetition of four tetrachord elements represented by four signs which were obviously taken from the Hagiopolitan Octoechos and Greek tetraphonic tone system: protus, deuterus, tritus, and tetrardus. These four Dasian signs and their derivations were used in a lot of tonaries. The innovation of the 10th century was the design of neumes which were so detailed, that they kept plenty of information concerning ornaments and accents. Rebecca Maloy (2009) even assumed that the use of transposition (mentioned as \\"absonia\\" in Scolica enchiriadis) might be found behind the diastematic Aquitanian neume notation—an assumption which clearly illustrates the weak side of Adémar's notation in comparison with the letter notation invented by William of Volpiano, which came never in use outside Normandy. Until this time very complex modal structures and microtonal shifts could be notated, as Maloy demonstrated by the most complex example of written transmission: the notation of the soloistic chant genre offertory. But Western notation did never develop modal signatures and the melodic structure was directly deduced by the diastematic notation. A second radical simplification became necessary, and so solmization was invented by Guido of Arezzo. On the background of his innovation, the later square notation was rather a reduction of the neume ligatures to a pure pitch notation, their performance was changed radically by an oral tradition of singing ornaments, of performing ligatures in a rhythmic way, and of more or less primitive models of polyphony which was no longer visible in the chant books of the 13th century. Thanks to Aquitanian cantors the network of the Cluniac Monastic Association was not only a problematic accumulation of political power during the crusades among aristocratic churchmen, which caused rebellions in several Benedictine monasteries and the foundation of new anti-Cluniac reform orders, they also cultivated new forms of chant performance which dealt with poetry, and polyphony like discantus and organum. They were used in all possible combinations which turned improvisation into composition, and composition into improvisation. The imitation of these forms in Spain, and Italy were caused by papal reforms which tried to organize the church provinces in newly conquered territories or territories which conserved older rites, because reforms could hardly be established for a long time. The diastematic notation of Aquitanian cantors and their most innovative use in tropes and punctum contra punctum polyphony which can be also found in the Chartres cathedral, the Abbey Saint-Maur-des- Fossés near Paris, and Fleury Abbey, also influenced the Winchester troper (see its tonary), the earliest and hugest collection of early organum or discantus. Since 1100, the florid organum reproduced the original function of the earlier intonation formula as it can be found in the tonaries. An initial ornament called principium ante principium (\\"beginning before the beginning\\") in the Notre Dame school allowed the solistic organum singer to indicate the basis degree of the cantus by an individual intonation in the higher octave, while the finale octave of each section was prepared by an paenultima ornament, which had developed by the \\"meeting\\" (occursus) of chant and organum voice.  Tonaries of the reform orders  During this long period Cluny's power and influence on less and less successful crusades which were well reflected in certain chant genres like conductus and motet, caused a decline and an increasing resistance among the monastic communities of the Cluniac Association between Paris, Burgundy, Île-de-France, and Aquitaine. New monastic orders were founded in order to establish anti-Cluniac counter- reforms. The most important was certainly created among Cistercians by a reform group around St. Bernard of Clairvaux.A list of the sources can be found in Christian Meyer's essay (2003) who also described the characteristics of Cistercian tonaries and the various redactions of Bernard of Clairvaux's preface. The innovations and corrections of Roman-Frankish chant during the Cluniac reforms were disregarded as a corruption of the Roman tradition, but the new books ordered from the scriptoria of Laon and Metz did not satisfy the expectations of the reformers. Instead rules based on Guido of Arezzo's Micrologus were codified to support the Cistercian cantors, while they were cleaning the corrupted tradition of plainchant.His prologue and treatise of the chant reform have survived in the 13th-century Antiphoner of Rein (fol. Ir-IIIr). Despite certain ambitions concerning the performance practice of polyphonic organum, the first generation of reformers around Bernard did not allow these Cluniac practices.Part of a 15th-century chant treatise about improvised polyphony was once attributed to Limoges, later it was identified as an appendix to Abbot Guido's Regulae about habits of the Cistercian rite (Sweeney 1992). The edition of Ms. 2284 Bibliothèque Sainte Geneviève (Coussemaker, Sweeney) has been revised recently by an edition (Meyer 2009) based on four other sources. According to Christian Meyer there was no explicit rule in the treatise which excluded polyphonic performances of plainchant from the Cistercian rite, despite the fact, that reform orders had been founded with monks, who had left their former monastic communities, after a Cluniac abbot had taken over and changed the local rite with new practices including polyphonic performance (“cum organo”). Nevertheless, they were established soon, as Bernard became one of the most important and powerful churchman involved in crusade policies which clearly corresponded to the refused aristocratic ambitions within the Cluniac Association. During Bernard's liturgical reform the tonary still served as an important tool and its modal patterns formed the basis of the corrections made by Cistercian cantors.According to Christian Meyer (2003) the tonary in the Milanese Antiphonary of the Abbey St. Mary of Morimondo is one of the most complete sources which is very close to those used in the Cistercian foundations in Austria, Germany, and Poland. = The tonaries in Italy = The local liturgical traditions in large parts of Italy remained stable, because there was simply no written transmission which could interfere with any reform until the end of the 10th century. A lot of local neumes used by Beneventan and Old Roman notators already started in a diastematic form, and the local scribes used the same opportunity to codify their own tradition, and in a second step of a reform which could not earlier be realized until a political conquest allowed the domination of a certain region, they had to deal with a codified chant repertory which was supposed to be \\"Roman\\". The transfer was done by written transmission, and this explains certain cross-references which can be studied in detail by the notated chant repertory, but more easily by the copies and the local neumes used in tonaries. From this point of view, several tonaries, already transmitted by earlier French sources, can be found in later copies in Italian manuscripts, often written in French scriptoria and their neume notation. Nevertheless, a lot of Italian cantors were authors of tonaries which played a key role during Carolingian, Cluniac, and anti-Cluniac reforms in France and Lake Constance. As example, William of Volpiano from Piedmont, Guido of Arezzo, whose treatises were used during the Cistercian and Beneventan reform, while there is no source which testify the use of tonaries among Roman cantors. The famous Dialogus, falsely ascribed to Odo of Cluny, the second Abbot of Cluny Abbey, was compiled in the province of Milan, while only \\"Formulas quas vobis\\", a tonary used in Montecassino and Southern Italy, was written by another Odo, Abbot of Arezzo. Older traditions like Old-Roman, Ambrosian, as well as Old-Beneventan manuscripts follow own modal patterns which are not identical with those of \\"Gregorian chant\\", i.e. the Roman- Frankish redaction between the first generation of fully notated manuscripts (since the 1050s), the Cluniac reforms (11th century), and the \\"Neo-Gregorian reforms\\" of the late 11th and 12th centuries in centres like Montecassino and Benevento,The term \\"repertorio neo-gregoriano\\" is taken from Luisa Nardini who also studied the Montecassino tonary and its role in the transmission of the Mass repertory (Nardini 2003). or in reform orders like Cistercians or Dominicans etc. The Norman-Sicilian tonary shows a great resemblance with manuscripts written in Cluny.

Being situated on the left bank of the River Ghirdiman and the slopes of the Niyal Mountain Chain, the settlement of Lahij is a unique living district, with its unusual planning lay out, transport systems, and its public, private and religious buildings. Lahij is an example of early urbanization and architecture, as shown by its cobbled streets and squares, together with its developed sewerage systems and water pipelines. Subterranean kurabandis (‘sewerage system’), made from river stones, and dating back to almost one thousand years, are thought to be one of the most ancient sewerage systems used in the world.Bretanitskiy L.S., Mamikonov L.G., Revazov U.B.

One of the most striking features of the urban look of Lahij, is the village square of each category, which, today, still has its specific role in the public life of the village. Earthquakes frequently occur in the region, and, as a result, a specific style of building construction has developed – which include certain styles and techniques in crosscutting stone and installation of wood. The ancient dwelling houses in Lahij have remained unchanged, as, during the past centuries, there have not been any significant changes in the urban planning. The ground floors of houses built in the main trading street are used as workshops and trade rooms. The traditional interiors of these Lahij houses include decorative tableware and other items, placed in different sized holes in the walls (known in Azerbaijan as takhcha, chamakhatan) and on wall shelves. Copper craftmanship Copper craftsman at work in Lahij Copper work is the most important of the skills developed by Lahij craftsmen. Lahij is renowned for its production of arms and copper items, decorated with carved ornaments. The development of copper production triggered the formation of such professions in Lahij as tinsmith, blacksmith and others, together with the creation of bituminous coal. The structure and supplies of copper workshops, as well as its traditional external look and its production processes remain preserved today, as they were in previous centuries.

Saint-Petersbourg, 1845 as well as, the rich copperware collections that may be seen in the museums of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russian and Europe, prove the existence of over 80 types of copperware equipment used in copperware manufacturing in Lahij. Leather goods’ manufacture was the second biggest craft skill in Lahij, after that of coppersmith. The local leather goods’ master craftsmen were expert in using shagren, tumaj and yuft as raw materials for various products such as shoes, belts, leather quilted jackets, book covers and bridles. Leather production in Lahij created suitable conditions for the development of other craftsmen, with associated skills – such as saddle makers, bridle makers, cobblers, hat makers and sheepskin makers. Cultural heritage There is a large collection of Lahij products in the Azerbaijan Museum of National History, which reflects the many different and richly made items produced by the Lahij craftsmen. Many similar items are also to be found in the Russian Museum of Ethnography (Saint-Petersburg) and the Museum of Eastern Peoples (Moscow). The Louvre Museum in France also has a collection of items from Azerbaijan, which include a copper pot manufactured in Lahij. The Museum of Bern has a collection of firearms and weapons of cold steel, manufactured in Azerbaijan, which includes rifles, swords and sabres, richly decorated with ornamental patterns and inlaid work.Efendi R. Samples of Azerbaijani crafts in European museums. –\\"Gobustan\\" magazine, autumn 1969 The major part of the cultural heritage of the Lahij represents interpretations of Islam, as well as folk rites, traditions, ceremonies and celebrations related to pre-Islamic faiths. Included within this heritage are the intercultural and inter-religious communications that were understood by the then peoples of Lahij. More than 1000 exhibits are preserved in Lahij Museum of Local History including pottery samples dating 2000 years back, bellows made in the 18th century to use in copper smelting, and other pieces associated with animal husbandry and trade, as well as information about the underground water line installed in the 15th century. The Museum is located within a building called Aghaogly mosque which was built in 1914 and transformed into museum in 1987. Tourism The development of international tourism, together with more knowledge about the people and cultures, has resulted in a gradual interest in the cultural diversity of the Region. Lahij, in recent years, has attracted the attention of many tourists visiting from countries worldwide and as a result Lahij is now included in the travel tours of several leading tourism agencies. Research Lahij, due to its unique and original features, has, throughout its history, been a centre of gravity for writers, scholars, artists and filmmakers, and, today, the residents make considerable efforts to promote the Region's cultural heritage. Manaf Suleymanov, the Azerbaijani writer and journalist, who was originally from Lahij, published a book, in 1994, entitled “Lahij: Ethnographic and artistic insight”. The natural and manmade beauties of the Region are reflected in the paintings by the talented Lahij artist – Agha Mehdiyev. The interest of scholars in the heritage of Lahij has been always at the highest level, and both Azerbaijan and foreign experts have written research papers about this unique village. Films about Lahij and its residents have been, and presently are, shown at international contests and film festivals.

TSAM has always maintained a high and respectable Scouting tradition. Its leaders and members are committed to further the ideals of Scouting in line with those as traditionally established by the youth movement's Founder, Lord Robert Baden-Powell of Gilwell, and as further developed by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). TSAM is a forward looking youth movement which, as a non-governmental organisation (NGO), enjoys great respect both locally and internationally. It is the only association in Malta which is recognised by the WOSM, and is also a member of the European Scout Region. Scouting, also known as the Scout Movement, is a worldwide youth movement with the stated aim of supporting young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development, so that they may play constructive roles in society. Scouting began in 1907 when Lord Robert Baden- Powell of Gilwell, a Lieutenant-General in the British Army, held the first Scouting encampment at Brownsea Island in England. This brief summary and highlight of events and other notable dates of the Scouts in Malta prior, during and soon after the end of the First World War (WW1), gives a very good insight of other Scout activities during this period. Being part of the British Empire, Malta was one of the first countries where Scouting started. The history of scouting in Malta is truly rich in events that mark its chequered history. The close connection the Islands have with the Scout Movement's founder, Lord Robert Baden-Powell started when he served in the rank of Captain as Assistant Military Secretary to his uncle, General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth who then was Governor of Malta, between 1890-1893. Scouting in Malta started in 1908, only one year after its establishment in Great Britain, and the Maltese Scouts were the first Association formed outside of the British Isles, together with Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa. Maltese scout troops were officially recognised in 1909 and by the end of the year a total of one hundred and forty four Scouts were enrolled in seven different Troops” (Mizzi, 1989, p40). The 1st Sliema Scout Troop applied to be registered by The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom on October 12, 1909 and, a year later in 1910, it was registered as the second overseas troop with The Boy Scouts Association. At this time there were 338 Boy Scouts and 3 Scoutmasters listed as members in Malta. Chief Scout Baden-Powell returned many times to the island, including during a part of his delayed honeymoon with Lady Olave, in February 1913, and when he inspected six Troops from Baracca, Dockyard, Floriana, Sliema, Tigne and Valletta. Baden- Powell recognised and shook hands with two of the Scouts he had tea with in London, during the Coronation in 1911. On 15 September 1913, the Malta Boy Scouts Association was formally registered by Imperial Headquarters in London as an Overseas Branch of the Boy Scouts Association. The first known Maltese scout troop which was registered was the ‘Sliema Land Scouts’ in September 1909 (interestingly, the 1st Sliema Scout Group - Bernard’s Own - is the oldest surviving active Scout Group outside the UK, and in 2009 they celebrated the 100th Anniversary of scouting in Malta), followed by ‘Barracca Land Scouts’ in December 1911. The Boy Scouts Association formed a local association in Malta on 15 September 1913 which became The Boy Scouts Association Malta Branch. War was declared in August 1914. The First World War had a significant impact on Scouting on Malta, since most of the Scoutmasters were also British and Maltese Servicemen, and who were ordered to the front in Europe. Within weeks of the declaration of hostilities, these Scouts from Malta were on their way to the Western Front. As camps were cancelled, the Scouts volunteered for war service as interpreters, in hospitals, in convalescent centres and in tea rooms, in the censor’s office and as coast watchers and messengers. By November 1915, there were 84 scouts on war duty, 44 of whom had qualified for a special war badge. However, as the latter half of the war progressed, membership rose sharply, and the Association’s general meeting on 30 November 1917, reported 1,200 members with 28 Scout Troops on the Island. The first troop registered in Gozo was the 'Gozo Secondary School’ in November 1916. On Sunday October 14, 1917 a rally for all scouts was held at Mosta. On parade were two District Scoutmasters, 20 Scoutmasters, 33 Assistant Scoutmasters, 115 Patrol Leaders and 625 Scouts. The Chief Scout, Lord Methuen presented warrants to the first Island Commissioner of the Malta Boy Scouts Association, Mr. E. Bonavia. An incident which occurred, and which shed some dark light on the Boy Scouts, was when some allegations were made that Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Movements had an alliance with the Evangelical Alliance, whereas their members were Roman Catholics. Thus, in August 1925, a group of Scouts from the United Kingdom were going to Rome to meet with the Holy Father, including a party of thirty four Maltese Scouts. In his book \\"Scouting in Malta: an Illustrated history\\" (1989), John A. Mizzi states that Baden-Powell told the Scouts: By your behaviour and good conduct, show to the heads of your Church in Rome that as Scouts you have not two masters but that your only Master is God and your Church. Your Scout masters are merely your elder brothers, showing you how better to do your duty as good Catholics. I want you to remember that and to obey the discipline of your Church. (Mizzi, 1989, p115). Mizzi (1989) also states that on his last visit to Malta, Baden- Powell said: I see a great change for the better in these boys as compared with the boys of the old days, now, as Scouts, they have interests, hobbies and aims in life and I would like your Scouters to realise that the time and energy which they put into Scouting is not thrown away; they are doing a big national service in giving their boys health of body, mind and spirit. They are thereby giving appreciable help respectively to the Church and Education. (Mizzi, 1989, p179). Shortly before his death in 1940, Baden-Powell wrote in a final letter to the Islands' Scouts: to congratulate my old friends, the Maltese on the plucky way they have stood up to the infernal bombing of the Italians ... They have the spirit of fearlessness and patience which enables them to face danger with a smile to stick it out to the triumphant finish ... The Second World War saw similar service from the Maltese Scouts, as they supported the Allied forces throughout the aerial siege of 1940 to 1943. This resulted in The Boy Scouts Association's branch and its members receiving a collective award of the Bronze Cross, \\"in recognition of their courage and devotion to duty in the face of continuous enemy action in the war for freedom\\". The Maltese Boy Scouts Association was then formed in October 1966, right after Malta became an independent nation earlier in 1964. In October 1966, an extraordinary general meeting of The Boy Scouts Association Malta Branch dissolved the branch and the Malta Boy Scouts Association was formed independent from The Scout Association of the United Kingdom. The Association became a member of the Boy Scouts International Conference in December 1966. The Vice-President of the International Conference, Lady Olave Baden-Powell, presented the registration certificate to the Chief Scout of Malta. In the years which followed, the Association changed its name to The Scout Association of Malta (TSAM). In 1966, the Association became an independent body and a full member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). In 1976 the name of the Association was re-styled as “The Malta Scouts Association”, and by a further amendment of its Policy, Organisation and Rules (P.O.R.) of 31 October 1978, in order to comply with the provisions of Act XXII of 1978 of the Laws of Malta, the name of the Association was established as “THE SCOUT ASSOCIATION”. In 2007, TSAM inaugurated the Beaver section in its training programmes. Since its foundation, Scouting has been one of the “most active and strongest youth organization on the Island” (“Brief History,” 2012). TSAM's motto in Maltese is \\"Kun Lest\\", translating as Be Prepared in English. The official logo and membership badge of TSAM features the Maltese eight-pointed cross and the Scout fleur-de-lys logo motif. History of Guiding in Malta In 1909, the founder of the Scout Movement, Lord Robert Baden Powell held a rally for all the members of the movement in Crystal Palace, London. He remained undoubtedly impressed by the thousands of boys parading past him. He was even more surprised when a group of girls filed by. When asked who they were, the girls courageously answered “We are the Girl Scouts.” History doesn’t relate exactly how many ‘girl scouts’ turned up, but they obviously made quite an impression as within months they had their own name and programme. Baden-Powell chose the name Girl Guides after the famous guide corps in India and it did not take long for them to make an impact. By 1910 Baden-Powell’s sister Agnes, had adapted Baden-Powell’s book Scouting for Boys for the Girl Guides’ use, and the Guide Movement was born. The same year, a newly retired Baden-Powell began to devote himself fully to Scouting and Guiding, and it was during a promotional tour that he met and married Olave Soames, who later became the World Chief Guide. By 1911 and 1912 Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting had been introduced in many countries around the world including Canada, Denmark, Ireland, South Africa, Sweden, Bangladesh, Poland, India and Cyprus to name a few. Girl Guiding started spreading throughout all the British Commonwealth countries, and so Guiding in Malta began in 1918 for British girls as part of The Guide Association (UK), when companies of British Guides were formed. In 1923, some Maltese girls became Guides and formed a separate division. The two divisions merged in 1938 to form one single body, although there were still some British Guides companies. As Malta gained independence in 1964, Guiding activities continued to gain strength. In 1966, two years after the independence of Malta, the Malta Girl Guides Association (MGGA) became an associate member of the WAGGGS. The MGGA is the sole national Guiding association of Malta, and it became a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) in 1966. The MGGA gained full WAGGGS- membership in 1972, and the last groups of British Guides left the island in 1978. The girls-only association has 1,337 members (as of 2003). The aim of the association is to \\"enable young girls and young women to develop good character formation and to discover their potential through an interactive programme giving a positive sense of direction and a world of opportunities as responsible citizens\\". The association is divided in four age-groups: * Dolphins (ages 5 to 7) * Brownies (ages 7 to 10) * Guides (ages 10 to 14) * Rangers (ages 14 to 18) The program is divided into eight areas: * Environment * Skills * Culture and Heritage * Health * Creativity * Local & International Guiding * Service * Mind & Spirit References ","title":"Scouting and Guiding in Malta"},{"id":"9449169","text":"The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies (also known in abbreviated form as Joint Center) is an American public policy think tank headquartered in Washington, DC. According to its mission statement, the Joint Center, through research, policy roundtables, and publications, produces innovative, high- impact ideas, research, and policy solutions that have a positive impact on people and communities of color. Ranking at #50 on the University of Pennsylvania's 2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report, the Joint Center served as the intellectual hub for a generation of post-Civil Rights era black thinkers, including Maynard Jackson, Mary Frances Berry, William Julius Wilson, Shirley Chisholm and John Hope Franklin. Originally founded in 1970 to provide training and technical assistance to newly elected African American officials, the Joint Center has since expanded its portfolio to include a range of public policy issues of concern to African-Americans, AAPIs, Latinos, and Native Americans. History, achievements, major initiatives =Origins= During the Civil Rights Movement, more and more blacks were being elected to public office. Many of these new black elected officials, or \\"BEOs\\", knew little about the ropes of their new jobs, such as political networking or even day-to-day administration. What's more, they couldn't count on help from their more experienced and better-connected white colleagues. At two national conferences -- Chicago in 1967 and Washington DC in 1969—BEOs expressed a need for a new organization, one that would provide new BEOs training and assistance that would give them a foothold in the mainstream American political process. In April 1970 The Joint Center for Political Studies (its original name) was begun with a two-year $860,000 grant from Ford Foundation. Howard University law professor Frank Reeves served as the center’s first executive director. The first board chairman was Louis (“Louie”) Martin, a newspaper editor who would later serve in the Jimmy Carter administration. =Early years= In July 1972, Eddie N. Williams, director of the University of Chicago's Center for Policy Study, became the Joint Center's new president. Williams' varied background—he was a former journalist and staff assistant in both the U.S. Senate U.S. Department of State—positioned him to forge the center into a full-fledged think tank, one that would \\"identify public policy issues that have implications for [black Americans] ... to be both a center for intellectual discovery and a wellspring of practical knowledge.\\" Williams expanded the staff, increased the amount and scope of the center's publication, and organized conferences around the country to aid BEOs. Joint Center data and research began to garner attention from legislative and judicial arenas. In anticipation of the 1976 general elections, the Joint Center formed the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation (now an independent coalition of 80 organizations), which increased voter registration and turnout during a campaign season that put Carter the White House by a slim margin. In October of the same year, the Joint Center became completely independent from Howard University and the Metropolitan Applied Research Center, which had had joint oversight since the Joint Center's birth. As the number of BEOs grew, the center’s role changed. The Joint Center helped form the National Conference of Black Mayors and the National Caucus of Black State Legislators, which began to take on much of the political assistance to black politicians the center had been doing. (The Joint Center also formed the Committee of Policy for Racial Justice around this time.) By the 1980s the Joint Center’s new leadership, believing that the civil rights movement had outgrown reliance on the charismatic leadership of a few individuals, realigned the Joint Center’ mission to serve as a full- fledged black think tank for scholarly research on social and economic issues. Through that decade and into the next, the Joint Center published extensive research on bars to minority voting and the effects of redistricting on black political power, and increased ties with non-black minority groups. By the 1990s the Joint Center’s research into a range of economic issues – expanding income gaps, the increased role of blacks in the U.S. economy, the condition of young black males and children, the accuracy of the U.S. Census, and the North American Free Trade Agreement – prompted the change to the group’s current name. But the group has continued to engage in some political assistance activities, such as providing training to South Africa’s new post- Apartheid political parties. =2000 and after= In 2002, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation gave the Joint Center a $7 million grant to establish the Health Policy Institute, which, Joint Center representatives said, will * improve the health of black Americans and other minorities and \\"expand their effective participation in the political and public policy arenas around health issues.\\" * \\"identify and promote effective solutions to the problem of health disparities.\\" * \\"inform members of Congress and national organizations on [health] issues.\\" In February 2014, the Joint Center appointed Spencer Overton, a George Washington University Law Professor, as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.

After San Diego gave up on Kirby, he tried out with the Minnesota Twins during spring training in 1978. He lasted only two weeks before he was released. Kirby was out of Organized Baseball before his 30th birthday. In his eight seasons in the Major Leagues, Kirby played 261 games (239 started) and had a 75–104 record with a 3.84 ERA, 42 complete games, eight shutouts, 1,548 innings pitched and 1,061 strikeouts. After baseball Following his baseball career, Kirby was acting tournament chairman for the annual Major League Baseball Players Alumni (MLBPA) Washington Metropolitan Area Charity Golf Tournament. The event, which benefited the American Lung Association, was part of the \\"Swing With the Legends Golf Series.\\" His family continued to live in San Diego County until 1983, when they returned to Virginia. Kirby became a self-employed financial securities broker. Death On July 19, 1991, Kirby underwent a coronary atherectomy to open a blockage in an artery just above his heart. After the procedure he was told he had suffered a silent heart attack. Kirby had been complaining about chest discomfort and numbness in his arm. He died of a heart attack on October 11, 1991, at the age of 43. His wife found him about 11 o’clock in the morning in his chair. It appeared that he had fallen asleep while reading and suffered the fatal attack. He was survived by his wife, Susan; his mother, Gloria; his sister, Carolyn Twyman; his son, Clayton; his daughter, Theresa Schoengold; and two grandchildren, Derek and Brandon Schoengold. He was buried in the National Memorial Park in Falls Church, Virginia.

Its tenants include Macy's, Dillard's Clearance Center, JCPenney, Christ Fellowship, Cinemark, and about 135 specialty stores and eateries. It was built by the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation like Coral Square for which it is similar in layout. History The center court's butterfly fountain in 1986 which has since been removed In the mall's center court, there used to be a fountain with a large monarch butterfly statue atop a waterfall, which fell in short bursts so as to create an unusual sound. The shopping mall also had a running theme with its additional two smaller bronze fountains, one featuring a boy and his dog playing with a garden hose, and at the other end of the mall a girl pouring water out of a bucket into the fountain. The mall was renovated in 2001, and all three fountains were removed, which was likewise done at the same time at Miami International Mall. The statue of the girl still remains at one end of the mall even though it is completely dry. The sculptures were designed by contracted sculpturist Norman Mansson. The mall's original anchors included Burdines (became Macy's in 2005), JCPenney, Jordan Marsh (became Sears in 1992 and closed in 2019), and Lord & Taylor (became Mervyns, then Dillard's, which converted it into a Clearance Center). A Macy's and a second Dillard's (now Christ Fellowship) were later added but the Macy's was demolished in 2005 to make way for a new lifestyle center. On May 4, 2007, Muvico Theaters opened a 14-screen movie theater at the mall's new lifestyle center addition. In March 2009, Muvico sold the theater to Cinemark. Several eateries and stores were also opened on the former site of the mall's original Macy's. In summer 2010, a new trackless train from Beston opened. It closed in 2015 to make way for Safari Rides. In 2017, The Disney Store closed. In 2013, Small Fry Carousel was closed to make way for a bungee jumping attraction near the Dillard's clearance center. H&M; opened a 15,000-square-foot store in summer 2015.

An Acrostic (1829) An unpublished 9-line poem written circa 1829 for Poe's cousin Elizabeth Rebecca Herring (the acrostic is her first name, spelled out by the first letter of each line). It was never published in Poe's lifetime. James H. Whitty discovered the poem and included it in his 1911 anthology of Poe's works under the title \\"From an Album.\\" It was also published in Thomas Ollive Mabbott's definitive Collected Works of Edgar Allan Poe in 1969 as \\"An Acrostic.\\" The poem mentions \\"Endymion,\\" possibly referring to an 1818 poem by John Keats with that name. The \\"L. E. L.\\" in the third line may be Letitia Elizabeth Landon, an English artist known for signing her work with those initials. \\"Zantippe\\" in line four is actually Xanthippe, wife of Socrates. The spelling of the name was changed to fit the acrostic. Al Aaraaf (1829) This poem is based on stories from the Qur'an, and tells of the afterlife in the place called Al Aaraaf. Poe included it as the major poem in his 1829 collection Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems. Alone (1829) \\"Alone\\" is a 22-line poem, originally written in 1829 and left untitled and unpublished during Poe's lifetime. The original manuscript was signed \\"E. A. Poe\\" and dated March 17, 1829.Hoffman, 31-32 In February of that year, Poe's foster mother Frances Allan had died. In September 1875, the poem, which had been in the possession of a family in Baltimore, was published with its title in Scribner's Monthly. The editor, E. L. Didier, also reproduced a facsimile of the manuscript, though he admitted he added the date himself. The poem is now often included in anthologies. \\"Alone\\" is often interpreted as autobiographical, expressing the author's feelings of isolation and inner torment. Poet Daniel Hoffman believed \\"Alone\\" was evidence that \\"Poe really was a haunted man.\\"Hoffman, 33 The poem, however, is an introspective about Poe's youth, written when he was only 20 years old. Annabel Lee (1849) The last complete poem written by Poe, it was published shortly after his death in 1849. The speaker of the poem talks about a lost love, Annabel Lee, and may have been based on Poe's own relationship with his wife Virginia, though that is disputed. The Bells (1848) First published after Poe's death, \\"The Bells\\" is a heavily onomatopoeic poem known for its repetition. Beloved Physician (1847) \\"The Beloved Physician\\" was written around April 1847 for Mary-Louise Shew, a nurse who also inspired Poe's more famous poem, \\"The Bells\\". The poem was originally ten stanzas long, although a version with nine stanzas was supposedly prepared by Poe for publication . It was never printed during his lifetime, and it now appears to be lost. Shew was able to recall about a tenth of a poem in a letter to editor John W. Ingham in 1875; these fragments were published in 1909, and appear to be all that remains of the piece. Bridal Ballad (1837) First published simply as \\"Ballad\\" in the January 1837 edition of the Southern Literary Messenger, it was later retitled as \\"Bridal Ballad\\" when it was printed in the July 31, 1841 edition of the Saturday Evening Post. The poem is unusual for Poe because it is written in the voice of a woman, specifically a recently married bride. Despite her reassurances that she is \\"happy,\\" the poem has a somber tone as it recounts a previous love who has died. In marrying, she has broken her vow to this previous lover to love him eternally.Sova, 34 Poe biographer Daniel Hoffman says that \\"Bridal Ballad\\" is guilty of \\"one of the most unfortunate rhymes in American poetry this side of Thomas Holley Chivers\\". He is referring to the name of the bride's dead lover, \\"D'Elormie\\", which he calls \\"patently a forced rhyme\\" for \\"o'er me\\" and \\"before me\\" in the previous lines.Hoffman, 66-67 Aldous Huxley made the same observation, calling the rhyme \\"ludicrous\\" and \\"horribly vulgar\\". The poem is one of the few works by Poe to be written in the voice of a woman. See also the humorous tale \\"A Predicament\\". The City in the Sea (1831) In its first publication in 1831, \\"The City in the Sea\\" was published as \\"The Doomed City\\" before being renamed in 1845. It presents a personified Death sitting on the throne of a \\"strange city.\\" The Coliseum (1833) \\"The Coliseum\\" explores Rome as a past glory that still exists in imagination. Poe submitted the poem to a contest sponsored by the Baltimore Saturday Visiter, which offered a prize of $25 to the winner. The judges chose a poem submitted by editor John Hill Hewitt under the pseudonym \\"Henry Wilton\\". Poe was outraged by what he considered nepotism; Hewitt later claimed that the two had a fistfight in the streets of Baltimore, though no evidence proves the event. Despite the controversy, \\"The Coliseum\\" was published by the Visiter in its October 26, 1833, issue.Sova, 54 It was later incorporated into Poe's unfinished drama Politian. In a July 1844 letter to fellow author James Russell Lowell, Poe put \\"The Coliseum\\" as one of his six best poems. The Conqueror Worm (1843) First published as a separate poem in 1843, \\"The Conqueror Worm\\" was later incorporated into the text of Poe's short story \\"Ligeia\\". The poems seems to imply that all life is a worthless drama that inevitably leads to death. Deep in Earth (1847) \\"Deep in Earth\\" is a couplet, presumably part of an unfinished poem Poe was writing in 1847. In January of that year, Poe's wife Virginia had died in New York of tuberculosis. It is assumed that the poem was inspired by her death. It is difficult to discern, however, if Poe had intended the completed poem to be published or if it was personal. Poe scribbled the couplet onto a manuscript copy of his poem \\"Eulalie\\". That poem seems autobiographical, referring to his joy upon marriage. The significance of the couplet implies that he has gone back into a state of loneliness similar to before his marriage. The Divine Right of Kings (1845) \\"The Divine Right of Kings\\" is attributed to Edgar Allan Poe, though not fully proven. It appeared in Graham's Magazine in October 1845. The \\"King\\" of the title is Ellen King, possibly representing Frances Sargent Osgood, to whom the writer pledges his devotion. It was first identified as Poe's in an article on November 21, 1915, using the poem's signature of \\"P.\\" as evidence. A Dream (1827) \\"A Dream\\" is a lyric poem that first appeared without a title in Tamerlane and Other Poems in 1827. The narrator's \\"dream of joy departed\\" causes him to confuse the difference between dream and reality. Its title was attached when it was published in Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems in 1829. A Dream Within a Dream (1849) \\"A Dream Within a Dream\\" was first published in 1849, the year of Poe's death, and asks if all life is really a dream. Dream-Land (1844) First published in the June 1844 issue of Graham's Magazine, \\"Dream-Land\\" (also called \\"Dreamland\\") was the only poem Poe published that year.Quinn, 415 It was quickly republished in a June 1845 edition of the Broadway Journal. This lyric poem consists of five stanzas, with the first and last being nearly identical. The dream-voyager arrives in a place beyond time and space and decides to stay there. This place is odd yet majestic, with \\"mountains toppling evermore into seas without a shore\\". Even so, it is a \\"peaceful, soothing region\\" and is a hidden treasure like El Dorado. Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn called it \\"one of [Poe's] finest creations\\", with each phrase contributing to one effect: a human traveler wandering between life and death.Quinn, 416-417 The eighth line of the poem is typically pushed slightly to the left of the other lines' indentation. Eldorado (1848) A short poem referencing the mythical El Dorado. A traveler asks a \\"shade\\" where to find the legendary city of gold and is told to \\"ride, boldly ride.\\" Elizabeth (1829) Believed to have been written in 1829, \\"Elizabeth\\" was never published in Poe's lifetime. It was written for his Baltimore cousin, Elizabeth Rebecca Herring. Poe also wrote \\"An Acrostic\\" to her as well as the poem that would become \\"To F——s S. O——d.\\" Enigma (1833) First printed in the February 2, 1833, issue of the Baltimore Saturday Visiter, \\"Enigma\\" is a riddle that hints at 11 authors. Line two, for example, references Homer and the ninth refers to Alexander Pope. It was signed only with \\"P.\\", though Thomas Ollive Mabbott attributed the poem to Poe - and solved the riddles. See the page on eapoe.org for more. An Enigma (1848) A riddle poem in a modified sonnet form, \\"An Enigma\\" was published in March 1848 in the Union Magazine of Literature and Art under its original simple title \\"Sonnet.\\" Its new title was attached by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. Its lines conceal an anagram with the name Sarah Anna Lewis (also known as \\"Stella\\"). Lewis was an amateur poet who met Poe shortly after the death of his wife Virginia while he lived in Fordham, New York. Lewis's husband paid Poe $100 to write a review of Sarah's work. That review appeared in the September 1848 issue of the Southern Literary Messenger. Marie Louise Shew (Virginia's one-time volunteer nurse, of sorts) later said that Poe called Lewis a \\"fat, gaudily-dressed woman.\\" Poe's biographer, Arthur Hobson Quinn, called \\"An Enigma\\" \\"one of Poe's feeblest poems\\".Quinn, 611 Epigram for Wall Street (1845) Printed in the New York Evening Mirror on January 23, 1845, the poem is generally accepted as being written by Poe, though it was published anonymously. The title neglected to capitalize \\"street.\\" The humorous poem of four rhyming couplets tells savvy people interested in gaining wealth to avoid investments and banks. Instead, it suggests, fold your money in half, thereby doubling it. Eulalie (1843) \\"Eulalie\\" was first published in 1845 in American Review: A Whig Journal and is about a man who overcomes his sadness by marrying the beautiful Eulalie. Evangeline (1848) \\"Evangeline\\" was included at the end of Poe's 1848 essay \\"The Rationale of Verse.\\" It was first published in the November 1848 issue of the Southern Literary Messenger. Evening Star (1827) This lyric poem by Poe was first collected in Tamerlane and Other Poems early in Poe's career in 1827. In the poem, a stargazer thinks all the stars he sees look cold, except for one \\"Proud Evening Star\\" which looks warm with a \\"distant fire\\" the other stars lack. The poem was influenced by Thomas Moore's poem \\"While Gazing on the Moon's Light\\".Campbell, Killis. \\"The Origins of Poe\\", The Mind of Poe and Other Studies. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 152. The poem was not included in Poe's second poetry collection, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems, and was never re-printed during his lifetime. \\"Evening Star\\" was adapted by choral composer Jonathan Adams into his Three Songs from Edgar Allan Poe in 1993. Fairy-Land (1829) Originally titled \\"Heaven,\\" \\"Fairy- Land\\" was written while Poe was at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Poe first offered the poem to Nathaniel Parker Willis, who wrote in an edition of \\"The Editor's Table\\" of the American Monthly of how he threw the submission into the fire and joyfully watched it burn. Nonetheless, it was soon published in the September 1829 issue of The Yankee and Boston Literary Gazette. The journal's owner and editor John Neal introduced the poem and others by Poe as \\"nonsense\\". He did, however, admit that the work showed great promise in the author. His introduction read, \\"If E. A. P. of Baltimore — whose lines about 'Heaven,' though he professes to regard them as altogether superior to any thing in the whole range of American poetry, save two or three trifles referred to, are, though nonsense, rather exquisite nonsense — would but do himself justice, might make a beautiful and perhaps magnificent poem. There is a good deal to justify such a hope.\\" It was first collected in Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems in 1829. In that collection, Poe dedicated \\"Tamerlane\\" to Neal. Robert Pinsky, who held the title of Poet Laureate of the United States from 1997–2000, said \\"Fairy-Land\\" was one of his favorite poems.\\"Sesquicentennial Tribute to Poe\\" on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, October 7, 1999. Fanny (1833) First published in the Baltimore Saturday Visiter on May 18, 1833, the poem laments the death of a young love. It was originally signed only as \\"TAMERLANE.\\" For Annie (1849) \\"For Annie\\" was written for Nancy L. (Heywood) Richmond (whom Poe called Annie) of Westford, Massachusetts.Massachusetts Town and Vital Records 1821 Richmond was married to Charles B. Richmond of Lowell, Massachusetts and Poe developed a strong platonic, though complicated, relationship with her. It was at Nancy's (Heywood) family farm in Westford, Massachusetts Graniteville Rd, Westford, Massachusetts; http://www.eapoe.org/works/letters/p4811160.htm ; http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/english/poebostonexhibit/poeslife/49.html that Poe would stay, at the invitation of the Lowell couple, while lecturing in Lowell.https://room50.wordpress.com/2013/05/18/buried-treasure-a-tour-of- lowell-cemetery/ It was here that the relationship developed. He even wrote to her of purchasing a \\"cottage\\" in Westford just to be closer to her and her family. Letter by Poe to Nancy Nov.16, 1848; http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/english/poebostonexhibit/poeslife/49.html The poem was first set to be published on April 28, 1849 in the journal Flag of our Union, which Poe said was a \\"paper for which sheer necessity compels me to write.\\" Fearing its publication there would consign it \\"to the tomb of the Capulets,\\" he sent it to Nathaniel Parker Willis for publication in the Home Journal on the same day as Flag of Our Union.Letter from Poe to N.P. Willis, April 18, 1849. The poem talks about an illness from which Richmond helped Poe recover. It speaks about \\"the fever called 'Living'\\" that has been conquered, ending his \\"moaning and groaning\\" and his \\"sighing and sobbing.\\" In a letter dated March 23, 1849, Poe sent the poem he wrote to Richmond saying, \\"I think the lines 'For Annie' (those I now send) much the best I have ever written.\\"Letter From Poe to Annie- http://www.eapoe.org/works/letters/p4903230.htm Nancy Richmond would officially change her name to Annie after her husband's death in 1873.Date of Decree Sept. 23, 1879 Middlesex County, Massachusetts Probate Civil #9378, Lowell, Massachusetts A large Granite Marker was erected for Poe at the historic Heywood home in Westford, Massachusetts where he stayed.

The Happiest Day (1827) \\"The Happiest Day\\", or \\"The Happiest Day, the Happiest Hour\\", is a six-quatrain poem. It was first published as part of in Poe's first collection Tamerlane and Other Poems. Poe may have written it while serving in the army. The poem discusses a self-pitying loss of youth, though it was written when Poe was about 19. A nearly identical poem called \\"Original\\" written by Poe's brother William Henry Leonard PoeSilverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never- ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 84. was first published in the September 15, 1827 issue of the North American. It is believed Poe wrote the poem and sent it to his brother, who then sent it to the magazine. T. O. Mabbott felt that the rather tepid value of this slightly edited version of the poem suggests that they were made by William Henry, though perhaps with Edgar's approval. The Haunted Palace (1839) Hymn (1835) This 16-line poem was sung by the title character in Poe's short story Morella, first published in April 1835 in the Southern Literary Messenger. It was later published as a stand-alone poem as \\"A Catholic Hymn\\" in the August 16, 1845 issue of the Broadway Journal. The poem addresses the Mother of God, thanking her for hearing her prayers and pleading for a bright future. When it was included in the collection The Raven and Other Poems it was lumped into one large stanza. In a copy of that collection he sent to Sarah Helen Whitman, Poe crossed out the word \\"Catholic.\\" Choral composer Jonathan Adams included \\"Hymn\\" as part of his Three Songs from Edgar Allan Poe written for chorus and piano in 1993. Imitation (1827) The poem \\"Imitation\\" was first published in Poe's early collection Tamerlane and Other Poems. The 20-line poem is made up of rhymed couplets where the speaker likens his youth to a dream as his reality becomes more and more difficult. It has been considered potentially autobiographical, written during deepening strains in Poe's relationship with his foster-father John Allan. After several revisions, this poem evolved into the poem \\"A Dream Within a Dream\\". Impromptu. To Kate Carol (1845) Kate Carol was a pseudonym for Frances Sargent Osgood, a woman with whom Poe exchanged love notes published in journals.Campbell, Killis. \\"The Poe Canon\\", The Mind of Poe and Other Studies. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 205. Poe was married at the time, yet his friendship with Osgood was very public. This four line poem, written with an almost juvenile tone, compares the woman's beautiful thoughts with her beautiful eyes. The poem, which consists of four lines, was published in the Broadway Journal on April 26, 1845. It was unsigned but Poe biographer and critic T.O. Mabbott assigns it as Poe's without hesitation. Osgood copied the poem and gave it to her friend Elizabeth Oakes Smith with the title \\"To the Sinless Child.\\" This copy is now preserved in the library of the University of Virginia. Israfel (1831) Written while Poe was at West Point, \\"Israfel\\" is a poem in eight stanzas of varying lengths that was first published in April 1831 in Poems of Edgar A. Poe. It was re-worked and republished for the August 1836 issue of the Southern Literary Messenger. In an introduction to the poem, Poe says that Israfel is described in the Koran as an angel whose heart is a lute and who has \\"the sweetest voice of all God's creatures.\\" His song quiets the stars, the poem says, while the Earth-bound poet is limited in his own \\"music\\". Poe's friend Thomas Holley Chivers said \\"Israfil\\" comes the closest to matching Poe's ideal of the art of poetry.Chivers, Thomas Holley. Chivers' Life of Poe, edited by Richard Beale Davis. New York: E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc., 1952. p. 78. \\"Israfel\\" varies in meter, however it contains mostly iambic feet, complemented by end rhyme in which several of the lines in each stanza rhyme together. Poe also uses frequent alliteration within each line in any given stanza. Although the name \\"Israfel\\" does not appear in the Qur'an, mention is repeatedly made of an unnamed trumpet-angel assumed to identify this figure: \\"And the trumpet shall be blown, so all those that are in the heavens and all those that are in the earth shall swoon, except Allah; then it shall be blown again, then they shall stand up awaiting.\\" —Qur'an (39.68). The poem details the beauty of the unearthly song of Israfil, as stars and other heavenly bodies stand transfixed in muted silence. Poe further alludes to Islam by referencing \\"Houri\\" as another heavenly entity entrapped amidst the majesty of Israfil's lyre. It is likely that such Islamic references were used to give the work an exotic feel. The poem concludes with the author wondering as to whether if their places traded, he could craft a bolder melody from his lyre than Israfil. The poem parallels Coleridge's \\"Kubla Khan\\" in the inspiring yet ultimately unfulfilling song of a heavenly muse. Hervey Allen likened Poe himself to Israfil and titled his 1934 biography Israfil: The Life and Times of Edgar Allan Poe. The poem was set to music by Oliver King in 1890 and by Leonard Bernstein in his Songfest of 1977. The Lake (1827) First appearing simply as \\"The Lake\\" in Poe's 1827 collection Tamerlane and Other Poems, the amended title appeared in 1829 collected in Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems. The poem is a celebration of loneliness and the thoughts inspired by a lake. For the 1845 collection The Raven and Other Poems, Poe reworked the first line (\\"In youth's spring, it was my lot\\") to \\"In spring of youth it was my lot.\\" Lenore (1843) \\"Lenore\\" discusses proper decorum in the wake of the death of a young woman. It began as a different poem, \\"A Pæan\\". Lines on Ale (1848) A simple 8-line poem, \\"Lines on Ale\\" may have been written by Poe to pay his drinking bill. It was discovered at the Washington Tavern in Lowell, Massachusetts where it was written. The original copy hung on the wall of the tavern until about 1920. The poem depicts a joyful narrator who carelessly lets time go by as he asks for another drink of ale, saying he will drain another glass. He enjoys the \\"hilarious visions\\" and \\"queerest fancies\\" that enter his brain while drinking. Lines on Joe Locke \\"Lines on Joe Locke\\" was a short, two stanza poem written to make fun of a commanding officer during Poe's time at West Point. Poe was known for his funny verses on staff and faculty at the academy. Lieutenant Locke was either generally not well-liked, or Poe had a more personal vendetta with him. The poem teases that Locke \\"was never known to lie\\" in bed while roll was being called, and he was \\"well known to report\\" (i.e. cite cadets for discipline purposes). O, Tempora! O, Mores! (1825?) Poe's original manuscript of \\"O, Tempora! O, Mores!\\" was lost. It was first printed by Eugene L. Didier in his own No Name Magazine in October 1889. This poem, mostly a sarcastic jab at a clerk named Pitts, starts out with the words \\"O, Times! O, Manners!\\" (an English translation of \\"O, Tempora! O, Mores!\\"). This phrase, which is commonly used to criticize present-day customs and attitudes, helps illustrate Poe's opinion that many men and politicians (during his lifetime) act as if they have no manners.www.eapoe.org (with the full text) A Pæan (1831) \\"A Pæan\\" is the original title of the poem that would become \\"Lenore\\". It was first published as part of an early collection in 1831 with only 11 quatrains and it did not mention the name Lenore. The name was not added until it was published as \\"Lenore\\" in February 1843 in The Pioneer. This original version of the poem is so dissimilar from \\"Lenore\\" that it is often considered an entirely different poem. Both are usually collected separately in anthologies.Hoffman, 68 Poetry (1824) This poem, most likely incomplete, was never printed in Poe's lifetime. Its two lines were found written on a page of some of John Allan's financial records. This is the earliest surviving manuscript in Poe's own hand. The Raven (1845) Romance (1829) \\"Romance\\" first appeared as \\"Preface\\" in the 1829 collection Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems then, in 1831, as \\"Introduction\\" in Poems By Edgar A. Poe. It took the title \\"Romance\\" in the February 25, 1843 issue of the Philadelphia Saturday Museum. The early versions made some allusion to alcohol with lines like, \\"drunkenness of the soul\\" and \\"the glories of the bowl.\\" In the poem, the speaker refers to some exotic bird that has been with him his whole life. He also says, \\"I could not love except where Death / Was mingling his with Beauty's breath,\\" a line often termed autobiographical as many of the women in Poe's love life were ill (an early love Jane Stanard died of tuberculosis, as did his wife Virginia; also, his later love Sarah Helen Whitman had a weak heart, etc.). Serenade (1833) This serenade is directed at the beauty of untouched nature, as well as an unnamed lover. It was first printed in the April 20, 1833, issue of the Baltimore Saturday Visiter with the name \\"E. A. Poe.\\" The poem was never collected in any of Poe's anthologies during his lifetime and was re-discovered by John C. French in 1917. This poem contains extensive examples of allusions from Greek mythology to strengthen the themes of \\"the beauty of untouched nature.\\" Silence (1839) Not to be confused with Poe's short story \\"Silence: A Fable\\", \\"Silence – A Sonnet\\" was first published on January 4, 1840, in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier. After some revision, it was republished in the Broadway Journal on July 26, 1845. The poem compares the sea and the shore to the body and the soul. There is a death of the body that is silence, the speaker says, that should not be mourned. He does, however, warn against the silent death of the soul. The Sleeper (1831) The poem that would become \\"The Sleeper\\" went through many revised versions. First, in the 1831 collection Poems of Edgar A. Poe, it appeared with 74 lines as \\"Irene.\\" It was 60 lines when it was printed in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier on May 22, 1841. Poe considered it one of his best compositions, according to a note he sent to fellow author James Russell Lowell in 1844. Like many of Poe's works, the poem focuses on the death of a beautiful woman, a death which the mourning narrator struggles to deal with while considering the nature of death and life. Some lines seem to echo the poem \\"Christabel\\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, a poet known to have had a heavy influence on Poe's poetry. Poe praised \\"The Sleeper\\" as a \\"superior\\" poem. He wrote to an admirer: \\"In the higher qualities of poetry, it is better than 'The Raven'—but there is not one man in a million who could be brought to agree with me in this opinion.\\"Quinn, 522 Song (1827) \\"Song\\" is a ballad- style poem, which was first published in Tamerlane and Other Poems in 1827, the speaker tells of a former love he saw from afar on her wedding day. A blush on her cheek, despite all the happiness around her, displays a hidden shame for having lost the speaker's love. It is believed to reference Poe's lost teenage love Sarah Elmira Royster, who broke off her engagement with Poe presumably due to her father. She instead married the wealthy Alexander Shelton. If this is the case, Poe was taking poetic license: he was not in Richmond at the time of her wedding. Sonnet — To Science (1829) \\"To Science\\", or \\"Sonnet – To Science\\", is a traditional 14-line English sonnet which says that science is the enemy of the poet because it takes away the mysteries of the world. Poe was concerned with the recent influx of modern science and social science and how it potentially undermined spiritual beliefs. Sonnet — To Zante (1837) A Shakespearean sonnet, it was first published in the January 1837 issue of the Southern Literary Messenger. The poem praises the beauty of the island Zante. The last two lines, written in Italian, are also used in Poe's earlier poem \\"Al Aaraaf.\\" Spirits of the Dead (1827) Original manuscript of a revision of \\"Spirits of the Dead\\" in Poe's handwriting. \\"Spirits of the Dead\\" was first titled \\"Visits of the Dead\\" when it was published in the 1827 collection Tamerlane and Other Poems. The title was changed for the 1829 collection Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems. The poem follows a dialogue between a dead speaker and a person visiting his grave. The spirit tells the person that those who one knows in life surround a person in death as well. Spiritual Song (1836) A poem, most likely incomplete, that was found in Poe's desk at the offices of the Southern Literary Messenger in 1908. The manuscript is believed to date back to 1836; only three lines are known. Stanzas (1827) The title \\"Stanzas\\" was assigned to this untitled poem originally printed in Tamerlane and Other Poems in 1827. Another poem with the title \\"Stanzas\\" was published in the Graham's Magazine in December 1845 and signed \\"P.\\" It was attributed to Poe based on a copy owned by Frances Osgood, on which she had pencilled notes. Tamerlane (1827) To —— (1829) This title refers to two poems carrying the same name. One begins with the lines \\"The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see.\\" The other begins \\"Should my early life seem\\". Both first appeared collected in the 1829 Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems. The first, consisting of 12 lines, was reprinted in the September 20, 1845, issue of the Broadway Journal and deals with the speaker's loss which leaves him with \\"a funeral mind\\". The poem, despite its many reprintings, never had any significant revisions.Sova, 238 The second \\"To ——\\" was republished in the December 1829 issue of the Yankee and Boston Literary Gazette after being cut from 40 lines to 13. The narrator of this poem equates breaking with his love as one of several failures. To —— (1833) This poem begins \\"Sleep on, sleep on, another hour\\" and first appeared in the Baltimore Saturday Visiter on May 11, 1833. It was signed \\"TAMERLANE\\" (just as the poem \\"Fanny,\\" which would be printed in the same periodical one week later) and addressed to an anonymous woman. It is essentially a lullaby. To —— —— (1829) This, another of several poems by Poe addressed to an unnamed person, begins with the line \\"Not long ago, the writer of these lines...\\" It was later renamed \\"To Marie Louise\\" for Marie Louise Shew, a woman who helped Poe's wife as she was dying. To F—— (1845) The poem that begins \\"Beloved! amid the earnest woes...\\" was published by the Broadway Journal twice in 1845 - once in the April issue then cut down to four lines in the September 6 issue with the more revealing title \\"To Frances.\\" Referring to Frances S. Osgood, the speaker discusses the chaos and woes of his life, and how they are calmed by dreams of this woman he is addressing. It was actually a re-working of \\"To Mary,\\" first published in the Southern Literary Messenger's July 1835 issue. It was also revised into \\"To One Departed,\\" printed in Graham's Magazine, March 1842, before it was ever addressed to Frances Osgood. To F——s S. O——d (1835 / 1845) Originally a poem called \\"To Elizabeth,\\" dedicated to Poe's cousin Elizabeth Herring and written in an album of hers. It was then published in a revised version in the September 1835 issue of the Southern Literary Messenger as \\"Lines Written in an Album\\" and apparently addressed to Eliza White. The poem in this version began, \\"Eliza! let they generous heart / From its present pathway part not.\\" White was the then 18-year-old daughter of Thomas Willis White, Poe's employer while he worked at the Messenger. Poe may have considered pursuing a relationship with her before his marriage to his cousin Virginia. One story suggests that Virginia's mother Maria expedited Poe's marriage to Virginia in order to prevent Poe's involvement with Eliza White. T. W. White's apprentice in old age would later say that Poe and Eliza were nothing more than friends. The poem was renamed to the ambiguous \\"To —\\" in the August 1839 issue of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. With minor revisions, it was finally renamed in honor of Frances Sargent Osgood and published in the 1845 collection The Raven and Other Poems. The speaker asks the addressee, \\"Thou wouldst be loved?\\" and suggest she stay on her current path to achieve that goal. To Helen (1831) To Helen (1848) The original manuscript was sent to Sarah Helen Whitman in 1848. It was published as \\"To —— —— ——\\" in the Union Magazines November issue that year. It became the second of Poe's \\"To Helen\\" poems when published as \\"To Helen\\" in the October 10, 1849 issue of the New York Daily Tribune. To Isaac Lea (1829) \\"To Isaac Lea\\" is an unfinished poem, presumed written in May 1829. Only four lines are known to exist. It seems to come from a letter Poe wrote to Isaac Lea, noted as a publishing partner in Philadelphia who was interested in natural history, especially conchology. Poe would attach his name to The Conchologist's First Book ten years later. To M—— (1828) Poe toyed with the working title \\"Alone\\" before this poem was printed as \\"To M——\\" in Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems. Poe would use the title \\"Alone\\" in 1829. To M. L. S—— (1847) Poe wrote this poem to Marie Louise Shew, who helped Poe's wife Virginia as she was dying. The original manuscript was sent directly to her, dated February 14, 1847. A revised version was printed in Home Journal's March 13, 1847, issue. To Margaret (1827) \\"To Margaret\\" may be an unfinished poem, never published in Poe's lifetime. In the original manuscript, dated 1827, Poe cites the references to other, mostly classical works, from each of his lines. The seven-line poem, according to Poe's notes, refers to John Milton's Paradise Lost, William Shakespeare, and Alexander Pope. To Marie Louise (1847) Written in 1847 for Marie Louise Shew, voluntary nurse of Poe's wife Virginia, it was not published until March 1848 in Columbian Magazine as \\"To —— ——.\\" Poe never pursued a romantic relationship with Shew, and the poem has no strong romantic overtones. It discusses the writer's inability to write, distracted by the thought of \\"thee.\\" The poem also references an earlier poem of Poe, \\"Israfel.\\" To Miss Louise Olivia Hunter (1847) Never published in Poe's lifetime, it was found as a manuscript dated February 14, 1847. It was included in the 1969 anthology edited by Thomas Olive Mabbott. The \\"Unknown Poe\\" anthology edited by Raymond Foye titles it \\"To Louise Oliver Hunter\\".Foye, 30 According to the Baltimore Poe Society, Hunter was a college student who entered a poetry contest judged by Poe in 1845. Hunter won, and Poe read her poem at a commencement ceremony on July 11, 1845. Poe's poem may have been written as part of one of Anne Lynch's annual Valentine's Day parties, though the poem contains no romantic or particularly personal overtones. The poem says the narrator attempts to leave but can not, as he is \\"spelled\\" by art. He compares this attraction to a snake beguiling a bird from a tree. To My Mother (1849) A heartful sonnet written to Poe's mother-in-law and aunt Maria Clemm, \\"To My Mother\\" says that the mother of the woman he loved is more important than his own mother. It was first published on July 7, 1849 in Flag of Our Union. It has alternately been published as \\"Sonnet to My Mother.\\" To Octavia (1827) An unpublished, untitled manuscript, a date at the bottom of the original copy (\\"May the 1st, 1827\\") appears to have been written by someone other than Poe. The date is questionable for this reason. The poem, which may be incomplete, tells of the speaker's unrequited love for Octavia being so strong, even \\"wit, and wine, and friends\\" can not distract him from it. Every throb of his heart, the narrator says, threatens to make his heart break for Octavia. To One in Paradise (1833) \\"To One in Paradise\\" was first published without a title as part of the short story \\"The Visionary\\" (later renamed \\"The Assignation\\"). It evolved into \\"To Ianthe in Heaven\\" and then into \\"To One Beloved\\" before being named \\"To One in Paradise\\" in the February 25, 1843 Saturday Museum. Modernist poet William Carlos Williams considered \\"To One in Paradise\\" one of his most preferred poems. The poem inspired a song composed by Sir Arthur Sullivan. \\"To One in Paradise\\" was published posthumously in 1904 and written for a tenor voice with piano. It is also the basis of the song \\"To One in Paradise\\" on the Alan Parsons Project 1976 album Tales of Mystery and Imagination. To The River —— (1828) First published in Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems, it was also included in the 1845 collection The Raven and Other Poems. Ulalume (1847) A Valentine (1846) First published in the New York Evening Mirror's February 21, 1846 issue, \\"A Valentine\\" was written specifically for Frances Sargent Osgood, whose name is hidden within the lines of the poem. In its first publication, it had the title \\"To Her Whose Name Is Written Below.\\" To find the name, take the first letter of the first line, then the second letter of the second line, then the third letter of the third line, and so on. Before its publication, it was presented at a private literary salon at the home of Anne Lynch Botta on February 14, 1846. Though Poe was not in attendance, it was a very public revelation of his affection for Osgood. The Valley of Unrest (1831) Though first published as \\"The Valley Nis\\" in Poems by Edgar A. Poe in 1831, this poem evolved into the version \\"The Valley of Unrest\\" now anthologized. In its original version, the speaker asks if all things lovely are far away, and that the valley is part Satan, part angel, and a large part broken heart. It mentions a woman named \\"Helen\\", which may actually refer to Jane Stanard, one of Poe's first loves and the mother of a friend. The poem was renamed \\"The Valley of Unrest\\" for the April 1845 issue of the American Review. This version of the poem is shorter and quite different from its predecessor, and there is no mention of \\"Helen\\". Chronologically Ordered List of Edgar Allan Poe's Poems *1824 Poetry *1825?

She is best known for her story which speculated that Walt Disney was behind the secret purchase of large parcels of land in central Florida, which became Walt Disney World. In 1965, Disneyland planned a year-long celebration of its ten-year anniversary, nicknamed the \\"Tencennial\\". Reporters from across America were flown to Anaheim and entertained by Disney, in exchange for their coverage of the celebration. The Southeast was a not a focus area for this project, however due to the sizable circulation of The Sentinel Star, a reporter was invited to attend the celebration. That reporter was Emily Bavar, editor of the paper's Sunday Florida magazine. Her instructions from her boss were to ask Walt Disney if there was truth to the rumors that he was behind the land purchase in central Florida. Bavar first posed her question to Disney's publicist, Charles Ridgway, who responded \\"Beats me. You'll have to ask Walt tomorrow at lunch.\\" (He was not bluffing; Ridgway was actually unaware that Disney was purchasing the land.) Bavar later recalled that when she did ask Disney the question, \\"He looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face.\\" Following the press conference, Bavar wired her story back to Orlando. The story, entitled \\"Disney Hedges Big Question\\", was run not as a lead story, but rather among many other rumors about the possible use for the land. Upon Bavar's return to Orlando, she was interviewed by newspaper editors and the newspaper decided to give her findings a more prominent place in the paper. On October 21, 1965, Bavar's article 'Is Our \\"Mystery\\" Industry Disney?' appeared in The Sentinel Star. The story stated several times Bavar had not confirmed the purchase with Disney, nor with anyone involved in the sale, and was based solely on Bavar's opinion. On Sunday, October 24, 1965, The Sentinel Star ran a larger follow-up to Bavar's piece - 'We Say: \\"Mystery\\" Industry Is Disney.\\" This headline caught the attention of several of Disney's closest confidants who immediately phoned him in California. Disney knew that he must respond quickly to the claims. The following Monday, Disney met with Florida Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the rumors and Burns announced in Miami \\"Walt Disney has extended to your governor the privilege of making the official announcement that Disney Productions is the mystery industry.\\" On November 15, 1965, at 2pm, Disney, along with his brother Roy O. Disney and Burns, held a press conference at the Cherry Plaza Hotel in Orlando to formally announce to the press that they had indeed purchased of land in Central Florida for building an entertainment venture.

Their main languages are Finnish and Finnish Romani. History Three Finnish Romani women in the 1930s. The original Finnish Kale were Romanisael who came to Finland via Sweden after being deported from Sweden in the 17th century. The ancestors of Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian Romani are English and Scottish Romani, who were deported from the kingdoms of Scotland and England.Eltzler. Zigenarna och deras avkomlingar i Sverige (Uppsala 1944) cited in: Angus. M. Fraser. The Gypsies (The Peoples of Europe) p120 In 1637, all Romani groups were declared outlaws who could be hanged without trial; this practice was discontinued in 1748. When Finland declared independence in 1917, all Kales received full citizenship and rights. During the Winter War and Continuation War, about a thousand Kales served in the Finnish military.  Culture  = Dress = Finnish Kale commonly follow their traditions in both male and female dress. Finnish Kale women choose personally whether to don the traditional dress or not at around the age of 17 to 20, and the choice is considered final. In case of nontraditional wear, modesty customs are still followed. Back in the 19th century, Finnish Kale men dressed nearly identical to the ethnic Finn farmers, in a coat, slacks, high boots, and a rimmed hat. In the early 20th century, many Kale men adopted the clothing style associated with the highly regarded profession of horse cab driver. This dress featured a white shirt, a jacket (sometimes in leather), a peaked cap, tall black boots, and baggy dark jodhpur trousers. The use of jodhpurs was very specific for the Finnish Kale, as Romani in other areas would have associated them with the often aggressive military, and thus avoided them. During the 1960s and 70s, the peaked cap fell out of use, and the jodhpurs and boots were replaced with slacks and walking shoes. Jackets are still worn as traditional Kale modesty disallows appearing in only a shirt. Light-colored slacks or jeans are rarely seen. The driver-style dress is used only by some of the older men, or by younger men for special occasions. The traditional female Finnish Kale dress stems from the traditional dress worn by the ethnic Finn women. Until the turn of the 20th century, Kale and Finn women dressed much alike in blouses, long skirts, and waist aprons. Over time and with increased wealth, the female Kale dress has become continually more decorated. The dress features a heavy full- length black velvet skirt worn relatively high at the waist, supported by padding, and a puffed blouse, often with prominent ruffles and lace, made of decorative cloth such as with sequins or a metallic sheen. Young children wear similar clothing to other ethnicities. Girls approaching maturity, but still below the age to don the traditional dress, often wear long, narrow, dark skirts. = Music = Taisto Tammi in 1960. Music is a central part of Finnish Kale culture, everyday entertainment and domestic life. In Finland, the Kale are known especially for their contribution to the Finnish tango and Schlager music. Kale men have been a vital part of the Schlager scene since the start of the genre's popularity in Finland following World War II. At first Kale singers faced direct discrimination, and for instance were banned from performing at certain establishments either on principle or following Kale audience misbehavior. Taisto Tammi and Markus Allan were the two most important earlier Kale performers; both adopted artistic aliases to reduce attention to their ethnic background. Since then, discrimination has lessened and Kale singers have no need to mask their birth names in order to succeed in their careers. Numerous Kale have participated in the Tangomarkkinat, a national tango singing contest, with winners including Sebastian Ahlgren, Amadeus Lundberg and Marco Lundberg. Perceived problems of the Kale in Finland =Socioeconomic status= The Kale have traditionally held positions as craftsmen, but the occupation has lost its importance in modern times, leading to a significant rise in unemployment within the group. A paper published by the Ministry of Labour states that \\"According to labour administration's client register material, 70% of the Roma jobseekers had a primary school or lower secondary school education.\\" According to the same paper: \\"Education is compulsory in Finland and this obligation applies equally to the Roma as to other citizens, but dropping out of basic education is still common among young Roma, while in the mainstream population it is extremely uncommon.\\" =Violence and criminality= In 2007 police officer and boxer Riku Lumberg (of Romani heritage) wrote an open letter to his own people, seeking an end to the \\"barbaric tradition of blood feud\\" in the community. Roma artist Kiba Lumberg has said the following about the culture she grew up in: \\"Blood feud and the violence that exists in Roma culture can't be discussed in Finland. We can't accept that some groups hide behind culture to excuse stepping on human rights and freedom of speech,\\" and \\"the problem is, that when a Gypsy dares to speak in public about the negative things happening in their own tribe, they face death threats. If a white person opens their mouth, they're accused of racism.\\" The Finnish Ministry of Justice indicated that in 2005, persons of Romani background (who make up less than 0.2% of the total population of Finland) perpetrated 18% of solved street robbery crimes in Finland. By way of comparison, the slightly larger Somali population (14,769 as opposed to an estimated 10,000) were responsible for 12%, while ethnic Finns were responsible for close to 51%. According to a 2003 report by the Finnish Department of Corrections, there were an estimated 120–140 Romanis in the Finnish prison system. The report discussed ways to combat institutional racism and discrimination within the prison system, as well as ways for improving rehabilitation of Romani inmates through, for example, education programmes and better cooperation with the Romani community at large.

The tower was nicknamed ’Jumbo’ after the London Zoo elephant as a term of derision in 1882 by Reverend John Irvine who was annoyed that the tower dwarfed his nearby rectory at St. Mary-at-the-Walls. Construction took around 20 months and was completed in 1883. 1,200,000 bricks and 819 tons of stone and cement were used in the construction of the tower. The tank is constructed of cast-iron bolted panels and when it was in use could hold 1069 cubic metres (37,800 cubic ft) of water. It was claimed at the time to be the second largest water tower in England. Inside the central pier are 157 steps to a cupola which at 35.37 metres (116 ft) above ground offers views a long way over Colchester and the surrounding area. After a century of service the water tower became superfluous to the water supply system and was sold off by Anglian Water in 1987. It has had multiple owners since. In 2001 after prolonged controversy permission was granted on appeal to replace the tank with a glass walled penthouse, but work on this never started and permission expired. In 2006 at the height of the UK property boom, Jumbo was sold at auction for £330,000 to a local developer. In 2008 a local charity was formed with the aim of restoring the Grade II* listed tower and making it a heritage attraction with guided public access. In September 2011 a subsequent planning application to convert the tower into a penthouse, flats and restaurant was rejected by Colchester Borough Council by 7 votes to 5. Further planning applications in 2013 were also refused, and the building was put up for sale in May 2014, selling for £190,000 at auction to local poultry farmer Paul Flatman A scheme devised by North Essex Heritage to construct a restaurant, gift shop and heritage centre within the tower were set back in July 2018 when an application for a Heritage Lottery Fund grant were turned down.

Despite the brevity of his reign he made lasting contributions to the Malankara Syrian Church. Mar Dionysius II is also known as Pulikkottil Mar Dionysius I as he was the first Metropolitan from the ancient Pulikkottil family of Kunnamkulam. He was able to keep up the traditions, improve the knowledge of the people and decree that the assets of the Metropolitan would be assets of the Church. During his lifetime, he renovated and managed Arthat St Mary's Church, one of the oldest churches in Kerala, masterminded in opening of the first formal educational institution in Kerala, namely the Orthodox Theological Seminary (Old Seminary)Malankara Sabha Vignanakosham, Fr. Joseph Cheeran. His nephew Tharu Kurien's son Joseph was later ordained as Metropolitan by the Patriarch of Antioch. He was also given the same episcopal title Joseph Mar Dionysious (Mar Dionysius V) (1833–1909) and was known as Pulikkottil Dionysious II. Early days Joseph Ittoop was born on 15 January 1742 in Pulikkottil an ancient family which moved from Arthat to Kunnamkulam. He was ordained as a priest by Mar Thoma VI and was known as Pulikkottil Joseph Ittoop Kathanar. He was the vicar of his parish, Chattukulangara Arthat church. Mysore ruler Tippu Sultan invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, in AD 1740. The people of Kunnamkulam defended the attack with all their effort. The soldiers of Tippu Sultan set fire on Arthat church and murdered a number of people. One of them was killed inside the sanctuary. Witnessing all these atrocities Pulikkottil Joseph Kathanar had no other option but to hide inside the church. A large number of refugees left Arthat and settled in Kunnamkulam under the leadership of Joseph Kathanar. After Tippu Sultan left, Joseph Kathanar returned to the parish and renovated the church, removing that area of the sanctuary where the man was killed. Consecrations =As ramban= As per the decision of the meeting of the representatives from parishes at Kandanad, on 14 September 1809, Pulikkottil Joseph Ittoop Kathanar was ordained as a Ramban.Ittoop Writer, Malayalathulla Suryani Chistianikauleday Charitram (History of Syrian Christians in the land of Malayalam), pp. 155–157. =Malankara Metropolitan= It was when Col. Munroe was the resident of Travancore, Pulikkottil Joseph Ittoop Ramban was ordained as bishop by the bishop of Thozhyoor Church, Geevarghese Mar Philexenos (Kidangan) (1811–29) on 22 March 1815.Niranam Granthavari (Record of history written during 1770–1830), Chapter 30. After the death of Mar Thoma VIII, he was made the supreme head of the Malankara Church by a Royal proclamation issued by the ruler of Travancore and later by the ruler of Cochin. The proclamation required every Syrian Christian of Travancore-Cochin to obey the Malankara Metropolitan. He was given the episcopal title Dionysius (a Graeco-Roman name), the second bishop in the Malankara Church to get this title. Orthodox Theological seminary Pulikottil Joseph Ittoop Ramban travelled to Kottayam and founded the Seminary. The government of Travancore provided tax free land and the foundation stone was laid in February 1813. The work went on very fast and classes began in March 1815. Qualified teachers to teach various subjects were also appointed. They were Maramon Palakunnathu Abraham Malpan (Syriac), Konattu Varghese Malpan (Syriac), Kozhikode Kunjan Assan (Sanskrit), Poet Laureate Chekottu Kuruvilla Assan (Malayalam) and from Kochi Mose Esarphathi (Hebrew & Greek) were the first teachers of this first education institution in Kerala.

After his return to England, missionaries who were members of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) began to arrive in Kerala. Rev. Thomas Norton arrived in Kochi on 8 May 1816 and began to open schools in and around Alappuzha. Rev. Benjamin Baily arrived in October 1816 and established a printing press at Kottayam. He also began to translate the Bible into Malayalam. Last days At the age of 74, and only nine months as Metropolitan, Pulikottil Joseph Mar Dionysius died on 24 November 1816. He was entombed at Kottayam Orthodox Pazhaya Seminary (Old Seminary). As Dionysius had not named a successor, the fate of the Malankara Church was threatened. However, Geevarghese Mar Philexenos (Kidangan) (1811–29) of the Malabar Independent Syrian Church stepped in to take over the duties of the Malankara Metropolitan and served as the Acting Malankara Metropolitan until ordaining a successor to Mar Dionysius II.

She became politically active in socialist politics during World War I and followed her friend Becky Buhay (1896–1953) to study Marxist thought at the Rand School of Social Science in New York. In May 1920, Algernon Lee, educational director, presided over the graduation of the second-largest class ever at Rand, whose members included: John J. Bardsley, William D. Bavelaar, Annie S.

In 1931, she led a general strike for better wages and working conditions for dressmakers in Toronto. In the mid-1920s, she became business manager of The Worker newspaper. Following the 1931 Estevan Coal Miners Strike, Buller spoke in support of formation of the Mine Workers' Union of Canada. On February 23, 1932, she faced preliminary hearing for rioting, for which she was convicted.

During the later 1930s, she managed the Mid-West Clarion party newspaper of Winnipeg until its repression under the War Measures Act (Defence of Canada Regulations). In 1940, during a crackdown on Communist Party members, Buller was arrested along with Louis Guberman and Jock McNeil and jailed in Portage la Prairie (1940–1942). Her husband Harry Guralnick was also interned at that time. Upon release from prison, she joined the Dominion Communist–Labor Total War Committee in Manitoba. She partook in the first national convention of the Labor-Progressive Party, when she was elected to the National Committee. =Political organizing= Buller helped found the Communist Party of Canada and Labor-Progressive Party (here, poster of Fred Rose for re-election Arising from efforts in the Montreal Labour College, Buller became a co-founder of the Communist Party of Canada in Montreal.\\" In August 1931, the Government of Canada made the Party illegal and sentenced eight Part leaders to a total of 37 years (an average 4-5 years each) in prison.

At the time it was dissolved, its boundaries were coterminous with the city of Evanston, and the population at the 2010 census was 74,486. The township history includes that of two townships that were both originally named Ridgeville Township and came to be renamed Evanston Township. History Loyola professor Patricia Melvin-Mooney states that a small community of German and Luxembourger farmers settled near the present-day intersection of Ridge and Devon Avenue in the 1830s, and the community became known as Ridgeville. Frances Willard in her 1891 history of Evanston associated the name with a log cabin, built in approximately 1835, southwest of what became Evanston, by former Major Edward Henry Mulford, the first jeweler in the area. The community was within the large and undefined voting district, north of the then-existing Chicago city limits, known as Gross Point. Ridgeville Township came into existence in April 1850, with its first elections held on April 2, 1850. Some early records use the name Ridgevill for the township. On April 26, 1850, the name of the Gross Point post office was changed to Ridgeville. The mail was received at Mulford's cabin, which had expanded to become a tavern known as Ten-Mile House for its distance from Chicago on the Green Bay stage route. Ridgeville Township was organized as a civil township with the southern border in the Irving Park area and the northern border at what is now Central Street in Evanston, which at that time marked the southern boundary of land reserved to Archange Ouilmette. The western boundary was Western Avenue, and the eastern boundary was Lake Michigan. In an election held at the house of George Reeley, the citizens elected Edward Murphy as the first township supervisor, and Philip Rogers as assessor. Gross Point voting district ceased to exist. Later elected officials included Chicagoan Conrad Sulzer, the first known European settler in the Ravenswood area, as township collector, and John Anderson, of what would later be called Andersonville, as highway commissioner. As of the 1850 census the population was only 441.\\"This is Evanston,\\" League of Women Voters of Evanston, 2000, pp 8–18 In the 1851 referendum on the Illinois banking law, only 19 voters came to the polls in Ridgeville Township. In 1853, the Board of Trustees of Northwestern University purchased in the northern part of the township and proceeded to plat around the university campus a village, which, in 1854, they named Evanston after one of their leaders. The founding of the university and the extension of a railroad line that served it spurred rapid development in the Evanston community. In February 1855, the Post Office Department changed the name of the post office from Ridgeville to Evanston. An Act of the Illinois General Assembly, on February 15, 1857, changed the township's name to Evanston Township, and redefined its boundaries. The township was split; and, for a short time, expanded to the north. The portion south became Lake View Township, and eventually part of Chicago. The part to the north remained as the renamed Evanston Township, and had added to it Archange Ouilmette's reservation on the north; but that reservation was detached and put into New Trier Township in 1859. A new Ridgeville Township was created by an enabling act approved on May 23, 1877 and amended on May 15, 1903; the new township was coterminous the city limits of Evanston, leaving the remainder of Evanston Township outside the City of Evanston. Eventually this newer Ridgeville Township came itself be named Evanston Township.Vance, Patricia A., \\"State of the Township Address\\" to the Evanston Township Annual Meeting, April 10, 2012. Copy in Submitted as part of the information packet for the Evanston Township Annual Meeting, April 16, 2013. Following special legislation enacted by the Illinois General Assembly in 2013, the electors of Evanston Township voted 5,065 to 2,889 on March 18, 2014 to abolish the township. On May 1, 2014, the city of Evanston assumed the duties and obligations of Evanston Township. Only twice before in Illinois history, and not since 1932, had a township been dissolved by public referendum. A park district in the south part of Evanston retains the name Ridgeville.

History  The first Armenian Scouting groups were organized in 1910 in orphanages in Van, present day Turkey. and continued until 1922 when Scouting was officially banned and the Young Pioneers became the official state youth organization in Armenia. But even after 1922 some Scout troops were left for a short period in Armenia, now part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. Armenian Scouting in Turkey was active also after the Armenian Genocide and even new troops were founded, but it caused them much misery. In 1920 there were 20 Armenian Scout troops in Constantinople with 750 Scouts and 50 Girl Scouts. In Egypt the first Armenian Scout troops were founded in 1912 in Cairo and Alexandria. In the years after World War I more Scout troops in the diaspora were founded i.e. within Homenetmen in Bulgaria and Romania. In the Lebanon Homenetmen Scout troops were founded in orphanages for survivors of the Armenian Genocide. In Paris Kourkène Medzadourian founded the first Armenian Scout troop in 1924. More troops were founded in France and a very good relationship with French Scouting was created. They formed the Scout association Haï Ari and became a recognized member of the World Brotherhood. Haï Ari had members of Armenian descent in France, Belgium, other European and South American countries. Scouts of this association took part in many international Scouting events such as Rover Moots and Jamborees i.e. in the 3rd World Scout Jamboree with 40 Scouts. Further more there were Homenetmen Scouts and other Armenian Scout groups, which belonged to the National Scout Organisations of their country of residence and were in this way also registered at the International Bureau. This was the case i.e. in Egypt, Cyprus, Greece, Bulgaria, Australia, Lebanon and Syria. Homenetmen Scouts were active in Turkey, in various countries in the Middle East, in Greece and other countries of the Balkan peninsula. An Armenian Scout troop was founded in Geneva in 1928. During that years Armenian Scout troops were also active in the Netherlands for some years. In the 1940s the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) formed its first Scout troops in Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. During the following years Scout groups within the AGBU around the world followed. In 1989 the first Scout groups were founded in Armenia again. 1994 saw the formation of the Armenian National Scout Movement Hayastani Azgayin Scautakan Sharjum Kazmakerputiun. In order to permit entry into the World Organization for Scouting in Armenia, Haï Ari withdrew membership in the World Organization, which passed to HASK on April 18, 1997. Haï Ari was disbanded on January 9, 1998.Journal officiel 5 (1998), No. 2941 Today Armenian Scouting is active within Armenia and the diaspora and there are strong links between both.

The view of the Mendenhall Glacier behind Auke Bay and Mount McGinnis towering over Auke Lake are some of the most popular photo opportunities in Juneau. The ferry terminal of the Alaska Marine Highway system is also located further out the road in Auke Bay at about 14 miles. The flamingo house on Auke Lake is a local attraction, known for its topical or weather-related formations of pink lawn flamingos. Whale watchings targeting curious humpbacks are available. Humpbacks in these areas are known to demonstrate special feeding methods, so- called \\"bubble-net feeding\\", and come very close to shores. The Coast Guard cutter Liberty is homeported at the Auke Bay Harbor. Auke Bay takes its name from the native Auke people, a part of the Tlingit tribe. Climate Auke Bay has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) Public Safety Fire and EMS coverage is provided by Capital City Fire Rescue. Originally, the Auke Bay Volunteer Fire Department provided services beginning in 1952 under the guiding principal of \\"neighbors helping neighbors.\\" In 1992, Auke Bay VFD merged along with five other fire departments to become Capital City Fire & Rescue, which serves the majority of the Juneau area. The Auke Bay Fire Station is covered by volunteer firefighters. At night, the station is staffed by \\"Live-In\\" Resident Volunteer Firefighters, who are allowed to reside in the station rent-free in exchange for staffing emergency vehicles a required amount of time per month. Law enforcement is provided primarily by Juneau Police Department, who are supported by the Alaska State Troopers and U.S. Forest Service law enforcement. The United States Coast Guard Cutter Liberty, a 110' Island Class Patrol Boat, is homeported out of Auke Bay / Statter Harbor and is manned with a crew of 2 officers and 12 enlisted. The cutter's primary mission set includes law enforcement, search and rescue, military operations, and environmental protection. During the summer months, USCG Small Boat Station Juneau maintains a 45' Motor Lifeboat at Liberty's moorings, providing a faster search and rescue asset as well as law enforcement capability to the immediate harbor area.

The Alaska Clipper was a Sikorsky S-42B four-engine flying boat. The aircraft was originally named \\"Bermuda Clipper\\" and served the Baltimore - Bermuda route. In 1940 it was renamed Alaska Clipper and flew from Matthews Beach on Lake Washington in Seattle to Auke Bay stopping in Ketchikan. The first flight landed in Auke Bay on June 14, 1940 and the last took place on November 6, 1940. After its Alaska service, the plane was renamed again, this time \\"Hong Kong Clipper II\\", and began service on the Hong Kong - Manila route. The aircraft was destroyed by Japanese bombing in Hong Kong Harbor on December 8, 1941.  Auke Bay Marine Station  For forty-seven years, Auke Bay was the home of Auke Bay Laboratories, the primary US Government facility researching commercially important fisheries in Alaska. Its studies included estimates of abundance of salmon, sablefish, crabs, and other commercial stocks, and the impact of fishing, development, and industry on those stocks and the habitat on which they rely. The original Auke Bay Marine Station was funded by Congress in 1958–1959 and opened in 1960. The 4-acre facility was declared surplus by the US Government in 2016, after the Auke Bay Laboratories’ headquarters was moved to the new Ted Stevens Marine Research Institute in 2007. In 2017, an agreement was reached whereby the Federal Government would give part of the property to the University of Alaska – Southeast to support its marine biology program, and part of it to the Juneau Docks and Harbors Division to allow for the expansion of its Statter Harbor facilities in Auke Bay.

Scouting in the Republic of Abkhaiza Abkhazia was served by the Abkhazian Green Scouts Youth Organization. The system of education in Abkhazia, inherited from Soviet times, has not been able to provide for all of the needs of Abkhazian children. After-school education did not exist prior to the advent of the creation of the Green Scout Programs. In these conditions the Centre for Humanitarian Programs the abkhazian NGO, together with the ecological society Apsabara, both of which are local NGOs, carried out a pilot project for a rehabilitation of youth. The soon-founders of the Green Scouts organized a few treks to the mountains with children aged 13–16, with the aim of rehabilitation and ecological education. They asked the children what they would like to have in a youth organization, whereupon the children decided that they need a Scoutlike organization. The participants called it Green Scouts, emphasizing the role of ecological education in their program. These treks had a lot of resonance among youth, their parents and many professionals. This activity provides rehabilitation, physical and ecological education, and gives an opportunity for kids to develop their character, and for adults to share their knowledge with children. The Green Scouts hope that in the near future, the program will grow into an Abkhazia-wide Scout movement, with emphasis on ecological education. The Green Scouts are running their program in a condition of economic crisis. The equipment the use is mainly privately owned. Finances have been provided by the Centre for Humanitarian Programs, taken from its limited budget. Several hundred dollars were donated from a British Quaker appeal toward the direct needs of the Green Scout program. British writer Peter Nasmith sent some photographic paper for the Green Scout photo laboratory. At the moment the Green Scout program is in the process of developing. Interested adults need appropriate training, first aid seminars need to be organized, and logistical and security questions (detailed descriptions of the routes, radio contacts with emergency services, etc.) need to be solved. The Green Scouts are interested in all Scout activities around the world, and wish to establish direct contact with Scouts from regions where the Scouting movement has experience and is recognized by WOSM, inviting Scout leaders from other countries to come to Abkhazia to share their experience.

As a diocesan Episcopa he did remarkable pioneering work in organising parishes and new mission fields. His evangelical ardour and concern for the unreached area, made him forge ahead expansion programmes and colonisation schemes besides establishing of several institutions.Mar Thoma Sabha Directory. Page 27. He was noted for his deep personal dedication to Jesus Christ and his zeal for the spread of the Gospel, continuity in the Evangelical tradition of the Mar Thoma Church. He was full of energy and sacrificial spirit. Early days Mathews Mar Athenasius Episcopa was born on 18 February 1907 at Ayroor, in Kerala. He was the son of Thomas Kurudamannil, Ayroor. His mother was Aleyamma, sister of Titus II Mar Thoma Metropolitan, Palakunnathu, Maramon. Parents called him Mathaichen. =Education= Primary education was at Ayroor, Kozhencherry and at Kottayam. For higher studies he joined Kolkata (Calcutta) Bishops College high school and Saint Paul's College. In 1925 he was able to obtain a BA degree and in 1929 a BEd degree. In 1934, he proceeded to join Wycliffe College at the University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Keezhillam school At the age of 21 he left home to go to the North Travancore which was an underdeveloped area. It had been selected as a mission field of the Evangelistic Association. In 1929 he and fellow workers started a school at Keezhillam as a means to reach out and help the people living in that area, with a group of fellow workers, having only their faith in God as their resource. They worked hard and opened the way for education for hundreds of children in poor families. In those days education wasn't free and many of the people couldn't afford schooling. By giving concessions in fees to such students, they were encouraged to study and the money for their education was taken from the meagre salary of the teachers who were gracious enough to accept it as a way of serving the Lord. Gradually education began to spread in those areas and people began to see the truth of the Gospel in the lives of their teachers. Perumbavoor School Rev. C T Mathew (Mar Athanasius) moved to Perumbavoor seeing the need of that area. He was supported by a small group of friends including Rev.C.I. Abraham and Mr.A. Cherian (who later became a judge). A High School was opened and classes began on 1 June 1931. Here teachers worked on fellowship basis, on the pattern of the Union Christian College, Aluva and of Madras Christian College, Chennai. A group of dedicated teachers under the leadership of Rev. C T Mathew, the headmaster, became the nucleus of an Ashram. The school was known as the Ashram High School. The teachers shared everything in common and lived a life of fellowship as the first century Christians, devoting all their time to the welfare of the students. The boarding home and the school became highly reputed across the state. Ordination Soon after opening the school at Keezhillam, he was ordained as a Semmasan (deacon) by Abraham Mar Thoma in 1929. While at Perumbavoor, in 1933 he was made a Kassessa (priest). Then while he was studying at Wycliffe College, Rev.C.T. Mathew was selected by the Prathinidhi Mandalam (Church Parliament) to be an episcopa of the church. Consecration Rev.C.T. Mathew along with Rev.C.M. John were consecrated as Episcopas on 30 December 1937 at Tiruvalla, by Titus II Mar Thoma Metropolitan assisted by Abraham Mar Thoma Suffragan Metropolitan and Kuriakose Mar Koorilose of Malabar Independent Syrian Church. Rev. C.T. Mathew was given the episcopal title Mathews Mar Athenasius and Rev. C.M. John, Juhanon Mar Timotheous (later Juhanon Mar Thoma and Metropolitan.) As an episcopa =North Kerala area= His deep devotion and sacrificial life and the spirit of fellowship were the special characteristics of his service as Bishop. This spirit of adventure and trust in God made him a master builder of the Church. Wherever he saw the need, he ventured into action even when no resources were in sight. Undeveloped areas in Malabar became his concern as the Diocesan Bishop. He went to un-accessed areas and helped small congregation of people who had migrated from Central Travancore, seeking opportunity to make a living. They were helped to settle down and developed as on small communities in a spirit of co-operation. Nilambur and Chungathara and other places up to Gudalloor were all reached by him and the small congregations were encouraged and supported in various ways. =Travancore area= Later when he was in charge of the diocese in Central Travancore, he concentrated his efforts in developing the congregations among the new settlers in Chittar, Seethathodu, Angamoozhy and other places which were very difficult to reach in those days. =Outside Kerala= When the Evangelistic work of the Church expanded he was the first Missionary Bishop of the Church, travelling all over India, visiting the scattered congregations and encouraging the Ashrams. He was present in many international Evangelistic conferences in Tokyo and other places. =Other developments= He opened dispensaries and clinics and schools while also caring for their spiritual needs. The Olivet Aramana at Chengannur, the Retreat Centre at Maramon and the Kalalayam at Ayroor came into being as a result of his enterprising spirit. It was owing to his farsight that the Charal Mount which has since become a favourite camp sight was bought and made available for the church. Last days Even though suffering from diabetes for many years, nothing could stop him from all out endeavour in the cause of the spread of the Gospel. After a short period, he succumbed to his illness and died on 30 November 1973 at the age of 73. He was buried in the Bishops' cemetery in the SCS Compound, Tiruvalla.

Mall History =Early years and Prosperity (1979–1987)= With construction crews breaking ground on November 1, 1979, Sunrise Mall was built over a 15-month period in the early 1980s on property less than 1,000 feet from the existing Padre Staples Mall (now La Palmera). Grand opening ceremonies were held on February 4, 1981, with Joske's, Frost Bros. and Sears as the mall's primary anchors. An H-E-B grocery store, present before the mall's opening, was on site. In its early years, the mall competed well against nearby Padre Staples Mall. Despite its close proximity to a competing mall, most retailers chose to locate duplicate locations within the new mall rather than close their existing ones. The mall flourished during the early 1980s, earning minor fame as a filming location for the film The Legend of Billie Jean. In response to a renovation and expansion of Padre Staples Mall, management began a major expansion and renovation in 1987 which was to add a new anchor store, Mervyn's, a movie theater, a nautical-themed food court, and two parking garages. In the midst of their renovations, however, Sunrise was dealt a blow when Joske's was purchased by Dillard's. Already having a location at Padre Staples Mall, Dillard's management chose to close the Sunrise Mall location, leaving Sunrise with one of their major anchor stores vacant. Montgomery Ward, however, stepped in and took over the location in November of the same year =Gradual Downfall (1988–2007)= In April 1988, just two months after completing renovations, Frost Bros. announced that they were closing their Corpus Christi location due to financial difficulties. Problems began to beset the retailers at Sunrise almost immediately. Many retailers were already finding it difficult to justify operating two stores within such proximity to one another. Gradually, major retailers began to migrate back to Padre Staples Mall. In 1990, the now closed H-E-B store on the property was connected to the mall by a corridor and re-opened as a Stein Mart, adding a sixth anchor store to the property. After more than four years, the Frost Bros. location was taken over in 1992 by Burlington Coat Factory, a retailer not normally associated with being a major mall anchor. Despite this, major retailers continued to leave the mall. The collapse of Montgomery Ward in 2000 along with the closing of Mervyn's in 2006\\"Mervyn's to shut its doors in January, will lay off 100\\" left Sunrise with two major anchor spaces vacant. A series of ownership and management changes left the mall mostly vacant by 2007, leaving a few non-traditional mall tenants such as an insurance agency, an unemployment office, and a medical clinic.\\"History of Sunrise Mall\\" Wilcox Furniture, a local chain, opened in late 2007, occupying a portion of the previous Montgomery Ward anchor store.\\"Sunrise Mall Gets New Tenant\\" =Rapid Decline (2008–present)= The mall fell into serious neglect in early 2008, including an incident in which the power was cut off by Reliant Energy due to the owner failing to pay the facility's electricity bill.\\"Sunrise Mall tenants can't beat heat\\" After a brief legal battle and a bankruptcy filing, the mall was foreclosed upon in September 2008.

It is unknown if the mall will close, leaving the major tenants who own their property open.\\"Sunrise Mall is sold at foreclosure auction\\" On August 31, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing this location a part of a plan to close 92 stores nationwide.

Sunrise Mall Today =New Ownership and Revitalization Attempt= Sunrise Mall was purchased at a foreclosure auction by Laredo, Texas-based IBC Bank, the mall's largest creditor, in September 2008.\\"Sunrise Mall is sold at foreclosure auction\\" A new management team was brought in to revitalize the facility and to market the mall to new tenants. Many improvements have been made, including a new air conditioning system and a professional security staff. Notably, the fountains, which were prominently featured in the film The Legend of Billie Jean, have been restored to working condition after years of being inoperable. The mall's only original anchor tenant was Sears, whose construction predated the mall's by five years. Sears closed in December 2019. The only original non-anchor tenant was General Nutrition Centers, but it was closed in early 2008. =Revitalization efforts placed on hold= As of June 2018, the mall has become nearly dead, albeit clean and well-maintained, but housing very few stores which lack business. The mall's escalators are all shut down, leaving only a few elevators and staircases to help people to the second floor. The upstairs food court has been reduced to one open restaurant, Orange Creations. Among the major attractions left are the anchor stores, arcade, mini-golf, two gyms, and bridal stores. At Christmas time, Santa comes to the mall's center. The famed fountains are sadly drained and no longer in operation. As of January 15, 2018 the Cinemark Dollar Cinema has ceased operation. The mall officially closed its mall portion to the public on August 11, 2019, but the remaining anchors are still open except for Sears which closed in December 2019.

He was a bishop from 1975 to 1988, and a missionary priest before that. Early life Easow Mar Timotheos was born on 25 November 1932 in Thonniyamala, a small village about away from Pathanamthitta in Kerala in south India. His birth name was Valiyaparampil Thomas Koshy (V.T. Koshy) but he was commonly called Thankappan as a nickname. He is also sometimes called Easow Mar Timotheos Thirumeni, where \\"Thirumeni\\" has the meaning of \\"Divine Body\\" (an appellation used to describe the physical manifestation of Krishna), or sometimes just Thirumeni for short. V.T. Koshy was the eighth child of Valiyaparampil Scaria Thomas and Achamma (member of the Thasiyil Pulimoottil family of Karthikappally). Valiyaparampil is a branch of the Thazhayil family of Elanthur. The family were members of the St. Thomas Mar Thoma Parish, established in 1899 in Thonniyamala. In the 1930s there were about forty or fifty families in the parish. Music – hymns and harmonium playing – were popular in the parish, and Thankappan was good at music. Thazhemannil Mathaichen (T. K. Mathai) was the Sunday school headmaster for many years. Thankappan was active in Sunday school, and practiced fasting (four days a month) from an early age. =Education= After his primary education, V. T. Koshy entered the Catholicate High School in Pathanamthitta, where he was a good student and devout, and performed public service works among the poor. Missionary work After passing SSLC, V. T. Koshy enrolled in the AMM Bible Institute in Tiruvalla for a short course. During that time he decided to go to the Sihora Ashram in Madhya Pradesh in northern India and perform missionary work. On 9 July 1952, V. T. Koshy reached the Sihora Ashram. After three years of temporary membership he returned to Thonniyamala to continue his education. Higher education In 1955, V. T. Koshy joined the Catholicate College in Pathanamthitta for intermediate class. He passed his intermediate examination with first class. His relatives offered him support to continue his studies and urged him to get a secular career and look after the family, but he decided to pursue theological training at the Leonard Theological College in Jabalpur, where he enrolled in 1957 to pursue his Bachelor of Divinity (B. D.) degree. George D. Mooken (later consecrated as Mar Aprem Mooken of the Chaldean Syrian Church in Trichur) was his classmate. Entering the ministry During his time at Leonard, V. T. Koshy continued to be involved with the ashram, and returned there in 1960 after receiving his B. D. degree. He was ordained as a deacon on 5 October 1961 and a priest on 4 March 1962. He became the vicar of North Indian parishes including Katni Parish. He was known as Koshy Babu among the villagers in and around Sihora. He taught the poor villagers poultry farming, cattle rearing, and modern agriculture. Training in Japan Reverend V. T. Koshy was sent to Japan for special training in rural development. After training he fully engaged himself in poultry and agricultural development. He was equally interested in village evangelism and was engaged in pastoral work in the nearby Mar Thoma Congregations. He wanted to start a training institute in Sihora to impart knowledge and to train young men in evangelism and rural development programmes. But it was made possible only as his memorial. Bishop In 1974, Reverend Koshy's name was proposed as a candidate for bishop after being persuaded by the Metropolitan (Juhanon Mar Thoma) to stand and he was elected. He was consecrated as bishop on 8 February 1975 along with Rev. P.T Joseph. Easow Mar Timotheos was the new name given to Koshy Achen. Rev. P.T Joseph Achen became Joseph Mar Iraneus (now Joseph Mar Thoma) After the consecration he was posted as the Assistant Bishop of the Niranam Marmon Diocese, under metropolitan Juhanon Mar Thoma. and then Wycliffe College in Toronto, Canada for further education. =Madras-Kunnamkulam Diocese (1977–1984)= After that, Easow Mar Timotheos became the bishop of the Kunnamkulam–Madras Diocese. He was instrumental in the establishment of a Mar Thoma college at Chungathara and was Chairman of the Governing Board. He also initiated the creation of school for the deaf at Kasargod, introduced projects for the welfare of poor women, and was involved in the development of the associations SSWAC (Society for the Service of Women and Children) in Chandhakunnu, Nilambur) and ADWAC (Association for the Development of Women and Children) in Kunnamkulam. And it was by his initiative that a women's hostel was constructed in Chandhakunnu for students and working women. He collected funds from the Persian Gulf parishes for the development of Malabar. Easow Mar Timotheos has been Chairman of the Governing Board of the Mar Thoma college at Chungathara, which was started out of his personal interest for the development of that region. He has been Chairman of the Committee directing the Wandoor Project for the integrated development of five Panchayats in that area. =Adoor–Mavelikkara Diocese (1985–1987)= After the death of the metropolitan Thomas Mar Athanasius Suffragaon, Easow Mar Timotheos was posted as bishop of the Adoor–Mavelikkara diocese. While he was Adoor his focus changed from material to spiritual development of the people, and he preached much on the fullness of the Holy Spirit and became a strong supporter of the charismatic movement in the church. This movement believes in a spiritual experience subsequent to salvation commonly known as the baptism of the Holy Spirit which involves speaking in tongues. This led to some opposition from conservative elements in the church, =Delhi–Bombay Diocese= Personal characteristics Easow Mar Timotheos was an avid reader of the Bible it was his habit to memorise verses whenever possible. After his death, the Church donated all the books from his personal library to the Sihora Ashram Library. He was in the practice of spending hours and hours in prayer. On certain days he would pray the whole night without eating any food. He used to fast regularly four times a week – Monday, Wednesday, Friday evenings, and Sunday mornings, and also for special occasions. During the construction of Chungathara College, a huge amount was required to pay off the debts. Easow Mar Timotheos, who was the chairman of the college, abstained from dinner for forty days and spent time in prayer for help. Help did come from a charitable organisation in Germany and all debts were cleared. Easow Mar Timotheos was the only Mar Thoma Bishop who was a fluent speaker of Hindi (which is mostly spoken in North India). His 21 years of Ashram life in Sihora, in Madhya Pradesh, gave him a broad view of life in Indian villages. He felt sympathy for the poor villagers and tried his level best to uplift them by training them in poultry farming and cattle rearing. Easow Mar Timotheos was willing to participate in menial chores at the Sihora ashram.Some recollections by V. T. Mathew (A friend of Sihora Ashram) Even after becoming a bishop, Timotheos sat with the common people on the floor, while attending prayer meetings. During his visits to the parishes in the Persian Gulf area, he showed interest in the welfare of the Mar Thomites living in labour camps and often visited them. Death In 1988, before a visit to the parishes in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Easow Mar Timotheos met with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who shared a common interest in the development of rural India. Easow Mar Timotheos visited and conducted services for all of the Mar Thoma congregations in the islands, including holy communion at the Church of North India cathedral. On 2 April 1988, All India Radio in Port Blair broadcast his Easter message. The following week (10 April), Thirumeni was the chief guest of Parish Day celebrations. On 11 April, after conducting a marriage in the Port Blair church, Thirumeni suffered a heart attack at the airport while awaiting his return flight to the mainland. He was immediately taken to J. B. Panth Hospital in Port Blair, where he died at 3:20pm. The government authorities in the islands helped to make arrangements to send Easow Mar Timotheos's body to Kerala. Through the intervention of Rajiv Gandhi a special Indian Navy plane was arranged and the body was taken to the Cochin Airport on Tuesday, 12 April 1988. From there the body was taken to the headquarters of the Mar Thoma Church at Tiruvalla. The funeral service was held on Wednesday, 13 April 1988 at the St. Thomas Church in Tiruvalla. A huge crowd was present to bid farewell to their bishop. On 13 April, at 1:45pm he was buried in the Bishops’ cemetery in the SCS Compound in Tiruvalla.

As a member of the group Kannemeyeriiformes, it was similar to the genus Kannemeyeria. The genus is known from the type species Stahleckeria potens, which was first collected from the Ladinian-age Santa Maria Formation in the Paleorrota fossil site of Brazil. Stahleckeria was named in honor of Rudolf Stahlecker, who discovered the first specimens during a 1935 expedition led by paleontologist Friedrich von Huene to the Chiniquá fossil site.  Description  Size of Stahleckeria potens relative to a human South Atlantic Friedrich von Huene (left) with a skeleton of Stahleckeria at University of Tübingen Stahleckeria measured in length and weighed approximately . It was a contemporary of the more common Dinodontosaurus. The differences between Stahleckeria and Dinodontosaurus may reflect adaptations to feeding on different plant species. In 2012, fossils of Stahleckeria potens were described from the Omingonde Formation in Namibia, which like the Santa Maria Formation is Ladinian in age. The Omingonde Formation is part of the Karoo Supergroup, which preserves many Triassic tetrapod fossils in southern Africa but notably lacks fossils in a hiatus called the \\"Ladinian gap\\". In addition to the remains of Stahleckeria potens, fossils of the cynodont Chiniquodon and an unidentified rauisuchian have also been found in the Omingonde deposits. The presence of these animals in South America and in Africa at the same time is strong evidence that the two continents were once one uninterrupted landmass with a uniform climate and habitat that land animals such as Stahleckeria could travel freely between. The fossils of Stahleckeria potens discovered in Brazil are currently in Germany in the museum of the University of Tübingen.

It primarily serves Monroe county in the U.S. state of Florida. In addition to publishing regular issues on Wednesday and Saturday, the Keynoter also publishes the quarterly magazine Unwind. The Keynoter is a partner of the Upper Keys Reporter, which specializes in coverage of the Upper Florida Keys, including Key Largo. The newspaper employs approximately two dozen people in two offices across Monroe County. The offices located in Marathon and Tavernier, work with the Miami Herald to provide complete coverage of the Florida Keys and southern Florida. The newspaper has been continually among the best in the state, repeatedly earning awards from the Florida Press Association for design and newswriting. The newspaper's coverage of fishing in the Florida Keys and surrounding waters has been repeatedly praised, and special fishing sections regularly feature columns and tips from local fishermen.  History  The Keynoter was founded by Edgar Seney, Jr., on February 19, 1953. Seney, a regular vacationer from his home state of Michigan, felt the Keys were missing a platform to inform residents about happenings and issues affecting the Florida Keys. Until that point, the only daily newspaper in the Florida Keys had been the Key West Citizen, which was and still is primarily concerned with events in Key West. Upon moving to the Florida Keys on a permanent basis, Seney began work on a newspaper that would eventually become the Keynoter. The first issue was published from a small Marathon office operated by Seney, his wife, and half a dozen other workers. Initially published on a weekly basis, Seney accepted a college fellowship in 1955, selling the newspaper to Nicholas Mitchell, associate editor of the Greenville, South Carolina, newspaper. The Marathon offices of the Florida Keys Keynoter In 1956, James L. Knight, one of the founders of the Knight-Ridder newspaper group, purchased the Keynoter. The Keynoter would remain a Knight-Ridder newspaper until 2006, when Knight-Ridder was purchased by rival newspaper group The McClatchy Company. The Keynoter did not come into its own, however, until Hurricane Donna ravaged the Florida Keys in September 1960. In the wake of the destruction caused by the hurricane, and to better provide coverage of the devastation, the Keynoter temporarily merged resources with the Florida Keys Sun, a weekly newspaper located in Islamorada. The two newspapers published joint editions for three weeks until splitting once more. After only one month of separate operation, however, the two papers merged permanently under the Keynoter name. The post-merger Keynoter operated an Upper Keys bureau in the former Sun offices until 1977, when the bureau was moved to Key Largo, where it today occupies the second floor of the Upper Keys Reporter building. In 1984, the Keynoter switched to a twice-weekly Wednesday and Saturday publication schedule under the motto \\"Everyone needs it twice a week.\\" The Keynoter continues to use this publication schedule and motto today. In 2000, the bi-weekly schedule was bolstered by the addition of L'Attitudes, a weekly arts and entertainment insert included in the Saturday edition of the Keynoter. Also in 2000, the Keynoter launched the Key West Keynoter, a Key West-oriented edition of the Keynoter, specifically written and designed to appeal to readers in Key West, the most populous city in the Florida Keys.  Awards  In 2007, the Keynoter received several awards from the Florida Press Association. In the categories of \\"special section\\" and \\"serious column,\\" the Keynoter earned second place in the 7,000 - 15,000 circulation division. It earned third place in the website and community service categories, also in the 7,000 - 15,000 division. These awards followed on the heels of its 2006 first-place finishes in the categories of general excellence, hurricane coverage, opinion section, web site, environmental writing, and sports column. In all of these categories, the Florida Press Association declared the Keynoter the best newspaper in the state of Florida in the 7,000 - 15,000 circulation division. That year, the Keynoter also received awards for in-depth reporting (2nd), outdoors reporting (2nd), obituary writing (3rd), editorial (2nd), serious column (3rd), and news story (honorable mention). In 2006 and 2007, Florida Monthly magazine named the Keynoter the best weekly newspaper in the state of Florida.Florida Monthly magazine, September 2006.Florida Monthly magazine, September 2007.

Activities  Maxeda DIY Group is the market leader in the DIY segment and has 345 stores in the Benelux and more than 7,000 employees. Most stores have a floor space of 3,000 to 5,000 m² and carry the name Praxis in the Netherlands (195 stores) and Brico in Belgium and Luxembourg (153 stores). Annual turnover is approximately 1.3 billion. All stores have a total of more than 1 million m² of retail space, with more than 1.5 million customers in the store and online every week.  History  The company was created in 1999 after a merger of Vendex (with previously the largest chain Vroom & Dreesmann) and Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer (KBB) (with De Bijenkorf and Hema). From 1999 to 2004 it was called Vendex KBB NV. In 2004, it was announced that Vendex KBB NV would be taken over by a group of investors, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co (KKR), Change Capital Partners and AlpInvest Partners (united in the consortium VDXK Acquisition BV led by KKR). Change Capital later left VDXK. In July 2004, Vendex KBB was definitively taken over by VDXK after all shares were acquired by the group . Until 2 August 2004, Vendex KBB was listed in the Midkap index of Euronext Amsterdam. The company was converted from an NV into a BV, after a few months Koninklijke Vendex KBB BV was closed down, and the BV that had set up the investment company to buy Koninklijke Vendex KBB BV was renamed Vendex KBB BV. KBB stood for Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer, but because of the loss of the Royal designation, the K had become a letter without meaning . The company was based in Amsterdam with 25,000 employees (16,000 FTEs) in seven countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, France and Spain) and net sales of more than € 4 billion (2003/04). The CEO was Tony DeNunzio (chairman of the board). On June 14, 2006, the new owners of Vendex KBB announced that the name was changed to Maxeda to highlight a new business philosophy . In July 2007, HEMA was sold to the British investment company Lion Capital . The acquisition amount has not been released, but analysts estimate it to be approximately € 1.3 billion, roughly equal to HEMA's 2006 sales. At the time, HEMA employed approximately 10,000 employees in 336 branches in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg. The strategy changed around 2010 and Maxeda continued with the DIY activities and all Maxeda Fashion businesses were sold. V&D; was quickly sold to Sun Capital Partners, de Bijenkorf to Selfridges Group and lingerie chain Hunkemöller to investment company PAI Partners. In January 2011, M&S; Mode, a chain of women's fashion stores, was sold to Excellent Retail Brands group (ERB). At that time, M&S; Mode had an international network of 417 stores In 2016, private equity parties Ardian and Goldentree, as venture investors (or so-called Distressed Debt Funds), became part owners of Maxeda by converting their loans into shares .

Its mission is \\"to document and communicate mountain exploration.\\" The headquarters is in Golden, Colorado. Subtitled as a compilation of \\"The World's Most Significant Climbs,\\" the magazine contains feature stories about notable new routes and ascents, written by the climbers, as well as a large \\"Climbs and Expeditions\\" section containing short notes by climbers about new and noteworthy achievements. Some general articles about mountaineering, mountain medicine, the mountain environment, or other topics are also sometimes included. Each issue includes book reviews, memorials of deceased members, and club activities. History The journal was established in 1929. In 1957 and 1958, the editor was Francis P. Farquhar. From 1960 to 1995, the editor was H. Adams Carter, who brought the journal to international pre-eminence. From 1996 to 2001, the editor was Christian Beckwith. Since 2002, the editor has been John Harlin III. The overall format of the journal has changed little since at least the 1970s, but current plans include more complete worldwide coverage (particularly including Europe and New Zealand) and electronic/online access (see below). Similar journals Other journals of record for climbing include the Alpine Journal published by the UK Alpine Club, the Canadian Alpine Journal published by the Alpine Club of Canada, the Himalayan Journal, and Iwa To Yuki, a Japanese magazine. All of these magazines are often used by climbers planning expeditions, especially those who wish to verify that a proposed route would be a new one. Entries in these journals (and others) concerning major Himalayan peaks are indexed in the Himalayan Index.  Online access  In March 2007, the American Alpine Journal inaugurated free, full, searchable online access for its issues dating back to 1966. All earlier issues will eventually be added. A complete index is also available for free download. A complete set of the journal on DVD may eventually be available for purchase.

There were favorable replies to this letter, and most of the recipients met in Wadham College on the evening of 3 July 1931, the day before the meeting of the Physiological Society. Gunn presided over the meeting. It was agreed that a Society should be founded to meet at least once a year for the reading of papers on pharmacological subjects and the discussion of questions of teaching and publications and to promote friendly relations between pharmacologists. The first female member of the society was Mary Pickford (1935), and other early, eminent women include Marthe Vogt and Edith Bülbring.

Like the village, the township is bounded by Harlem Avenue, North Avenue, Madison Avenue to Lathrop Avenue, to Central Avenue and back to Harlem. History The village incorporated in 1880 as part of Proviso Township. Miss Thatcher, a resident at that time, said, \\"The Village of River Forest was incorporated as a matter of necessity to defeat the saloonkeepers' project to organize and open a liquor sales district, and destroy our village.\\" However, later that year, the village trustees licensed two saloons in the east part of the village to raise funds for running the government. In 1917, the board of education petitioned the village to create a separate township in an effort to increase revenue to fund growing educational requirements. Cost savings were anticipated by avoiding the duplication of certain village and township officers. Taxes for township roads and bridges were eliminated. The plan also made funds raised by taxation immediately available to the community to support community interests. Finally, it was thought that an in-town assessor would provide a more equitable tax assessment. This separation was approved by citizens via a postcard referendum vote held on April 17, 1917.

He served in the governments of the 1950s and 1960s, playing an important role in establishing independent television. Early life Born in Liverpool, Lancashire, Bevins was one of five children. He was educated at the Dovedale Road School and then at Liverpool Collegiate School. He joined the insurance business, and also became interested in politics: he joined the Labour Party. In 1935 he was elected to Liverpool City Council. Wartime service At the outbreak of the Second World War, Bevins enlisted in the Royal Artillery. He served as a gunner in 1940, and was stationed in the middle-east and in Europe. He completed his tour of duty as a Major in the Royal Army Service Corps, and became a strong supporter of the Conservative Party. At the conclusion of the war he immediately sought a Parliamentary nomination. He was chosen to run for the West Toxteth division Labour-held seat; he lost by 4,814 votes, on a pro-Labour swing much less than the national average. Search for a seat Bevins, who remained on the City Council after his change of parties, became a popular figure in the Liverpool Conservative Association. In 1947 he was chosen to fight the Liverpool Edge Hill division in a by-election. Although he did not win, he reduced the Labour majority to less than 2,000. Boundary changes announced the next year created a united seat in Liverpool Toxteth, and the sitting Member of Parliament for East Toxteth, Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, chose to move constituencies to Beckenham. Bevins was chosen to attempt to retain the new seat for the Conservatives. Parliament He succeeded in the 1950 general election by 2,620 votes. When the Conservative Party returned to office in 1951, Bevins was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, Harold Macmillan. His knowledge of Liverpool municipal housing issues was valuable to the Minister who was leading a housing drive. In November 1953, he was brought into the government himself as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works. Rise through Government Macmillan became Prime Minister in January 1957 and moved Bevins back to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. He had a key role in guiding through Parliament the Rent Act 1957, which removed rent control and was highly controversial. After the 1959 general election, Bevins was appointed Postmaster-General, placing him in control of a government department. Although the role was not in Macmillan's cabinet and rather low in the formal priorities, it had a higher public profile than this situation would suggest. Bevins was also appointed to the Privy Council and became \\"The Right Honourable Reginald Bevins\\". Postmaster General Among the responsibilities for the Postmaster General was television. Bevins was, like Macmillan, a supporter of commercial television, which many in the Conservative Party then regarded as un-British. He had guidance from a friend of Macmillan, Norman Collins, who was involved in Associated TeleVision (ATV). Bevins had a delicate role as the potential profitability of the new entertainment medium was high; Bevins observed that when Lord Thomson said commercial television was \\"a licence to print money\\", he had been more indiscreet than inaccurate. In November 1962, Bevins was telephoned by journalists who asked him about the new BBC satire programme That Was The Week That Was; Bevins said he intended to do something about it. However, Macmillan immediately sent him a memo telling him to do nothing. After the Great Train Robbery in August 1963, Bevins was criticised for laxity in security as the robbery had happened on a mail train. He moved to increase security, but resisted calls to have armed police guarding the trains. That October, Bevins was shocked at the choice of Sir Alec Douglas-Home as the new Prime Minister (to replace Macmillan), as he thought Douglas-Home was part of the upper-class traditional leadership of the Conservatives who would find it difficult to win support from the electorate. The General Post Office workers' pay negotiations of 1964 were particularly fraught. The government was running an incomes policy, but Bevins pressed for an offer of 5%; the Cabinet insisted on a lower offer, which resulted in a strike threat. The eventual settlement was 6·5%, and Bevins ended up taking the blame for fuelling wage inflation; he felt resentful, on the ground that his own approach would have led to a lower settlement. Defeat At the 1964 general election, Bevins lost his marginal seat. He immediately declared he would have no further political involvement until the upper-class establishment was removed from the Conservative leadership. Although supporting Reginald Maudling, he was cheered by Edward Heath's election in 1965. He knew he would have no chance of a comeback in politics and wrote a book called The Greasy Pole, which laid bare his bitterness with his treatment. He also called for reforms of Parliamentary procedure to reduce the Parliamentary week to three days and to sit for only 20 weeks in the year. Bevins worked for Francis Industries, an engineering company. His son Anthony Bevins became a political journalist.

Nordyke (February 4, 1952 - December 29, 2003) was an American educator who co-wrote the Charter School Bill for the U.S. state of Ohio. Background Born in Dayton, Ohio, Nordyke earned a degree from the University of Dayton in English and secondary education. He took graduate courses at Xavier University in Cincinnati, and he also worked toward a doctoral degree at Miami University in Ohio. After teaching in public and parochial schools, Nordyke founded Harmony Community School in 1998. He died in the school in 2003 over winter break, but the school still worked to achieve Nordyke's vision and mission. Harmony Community School Harmony Community School (located in Roselawn, a neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio), was one of the largest charter high schools in the state of Ohio. The school's slogan was \\"One size fits few,\\" which was a shortened form of Nordyke's educational philosophy. It closed on December 31, 2008. Charter schools Ohio has emerged in the top ten list for states with the most Charter schools. The issue has been politically divisive, with Republican lawmakers tending to side with Charter schools, and Ohio teacher unions vehemently opposing the concept. The current Ohio law pertaining to Charter schools can be found here. Controversy During his career, Nordyke became a lightning rod for controversy, engaging in publicized disputes with local politicians, oversight agencies, his own school board members, and even the local public library system. In 2001, David Nordyke's organization received $460,000 in public funds to cover the costs of salaries, supplies, and the rental of a facility. However, after complaints from the local library system, the government officials learned that Nordyke had previously left the facility while owing $40,000 in back rent, and had been secretly teaching the students at a local library without notifying his funding sources or the library itself. Despite calls from then-State Senator and current Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory to revoke the school's funding, Nordyke was able to secure a local warehouse to house the school and thus preserve its identity as a school.

Known for the great intensity of her performances, Galvany particularly excelled in portraying Verdi heroines. She was notably a regular performer at the New York City Opera between 1972 and 1983. Biography Born Myra Beth Genis in Paterson, New Jersey, Galvany studied primarily under Armen Boyajian (also the teacher of Paul Plishka, Samuel Ramey, and Harry Theyard). She made her professional opera debut at the Seattle Opera in 1968 in the title role of Giacomo Puccini's Tosca. The following year, she portrayed the title heroine in Simon Mayr's Medea in Corinto in New York City, a performance which was recorded for Vanguard. She made her first international appearance in 1972 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in the title role of Giuseppe Verdi's Aida. In 1972 Galvany was offered a contract to join the roster of principal singers at New York City Opera by Julius Rudel. She accepted, making her debut with the company later that year as Elisabetta in Gaetano Donizetti's Maria Stuarda opposite Beverly Sills in the title role. She continued to sing regularly with that company through 1983, portraying such roles as Abigaille in Nabucco, Amelia in Un ballo in maschera, Gilda in Rigoletto, Odabella in Attila, Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana, Violetta in La traviata, and the title roles in Anna Bolena and Luigi Cherubini's Médée. She also sang in several different productions of Tosca where she partnered such tenors as José Carreras and Theyard. In 1973, Galvany filmed her acclaimed Lady Macbeth, in Macbeth, for the Canadian Broadcasting Company, opposite Louis Quilico. That same year she made her first appearance with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company as Aida with Pier Miranda Ferraro as Radamès, Joann Grillo as Amneris, and Gianfranco Rivoli conducting. In 1974 she made her first appearance at the New Orleans Opera opening the 1974–1975 season as Rachel in Fromental Halévy's La Juive with Richard Tucker as Eléazar. She returned to open the company's next two consecutive seasons as Aida and Valentine in Les Huguenots, the latter production with Rita Shane and Susanne Marsee. She later returned to New Orleans to sing Salomé in Jules Massenet's Hérodiade. Galvany made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1979, in the title role of Norma. In 1985, the singing-actress sang Gertrud in Hänsel und Gretel and Ortrud in Lohengrin on tour with the company, then the Kostelnička in Jenůfa during the Fall Season in the theatre. At the Cincinnati Opera, she appeared in Turandot (with Theyard) and Salome (with Ticho Parly as Herod). During the mid-1980s, Galvany began to add mezzo-soprano roles to her repertoire. She sang Amneris in Aida at the Cincinnati Opera in 1985. In 1992 she sang the title role in Bizet's Carmen with the New York Grand Opera. (NYGO) She performed frequently with the NYGO up into the early 2000s. On the international stage Galvany has appeared at the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt, the Liceu, the Great Theatre, Warsaw, the National Theatre in Prague, and the National Theatre in Belgrade among others. She has also sung in operas in Brazil and Venezuela.

They were designed when it became apparent that using the Best management practice (BMP) for rainfall runoff was not working. Snow filtration is a system to deal with left-over snow in an environmentally friendly way. Removing snow from roads is done to ensure road safety. The conventional method is by removing the snow and emptying it into rivers. However, since salt is used to melt ice on the roads, the salt also enters the rivers with the dumped snow. This increases the salt content of the rivers which can have impacts on aquatic and marine ecosystems. The practice of removing snow from streets and off-loading it into rivers affects the aquatic ecosystems. Method In the Spring as snow melts, the salt utilized on roads as a deicer are left behind. This can be environmentally damaging as it creates a hypertonic environment for plants. The snow runoff is collected and brought to a collection center. It is directed through an oil and grit separator which also monitors the consistency of pollutants in the runoff. The oil and grit separator causes electrochemical and biological processes, which bind heavy metals and nutrients to the sediment by means of reduction-oxidation reactions. At the same time, this reduces the amount of chlorine present in the runoff. The runoff then flows into a catch basin, where plants use the salt ions (e.g. K+, P3−, N3−) for their growth. The runoff is further filtered by the plants, leaving only clean water to go back into streams and rivers.

On June 21, 1996, the museum was accorded its current status of the National Museum by the special decree signed by Leonid Kuchma, the then- President of Ukraine. It is one of the largest museums in Ukraine (over 300 thousand exhibits) centered on the now famous 62-meter tall Motherland statue, which has become one of the best recognized landmarks of Kyiv. The museum has been attended by over 21 million visitors. Memorial complex The memorial complex covers the area of 10 hectares (approximately 24.7 acres) on the hill, overlooking the Dnieper River. It contains the giant bowl \\"The Flame of Glory\\", a site with World War II military equipment, and the \\"Alley of the Hero Cities\\". One of the museums also displays the armaments used by the Soviet army post World War II. The sculptures in the alley depict the courageous defence of the Soviet border from the 1941 German invasion, terrors of the Nazi occupation, partisan struggle, devoted work on the home front, and the 1943 Battle of the Dnieper.

He is best known for being a wicked usurer, and by association with his son, Enrico degli Scrovegni, who commissioned the famous Arena Chapel by Giotto. Place in Dante's Inferno In Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy poem Inferno, Dante says that he saw Reginaldo in the inner ring of the Seventh Circle of Hell, where the violent are eternally punished. The inner ring of the Seventh Circle is a burning hot desert with a continual rain of fire. The usurers are to be found sitting on the sand, swatting away fire like animals swat bugs, and crying. Around their necks are found purses emblazoned with their coats of arms. This, and a bit of research into Dante's time-period, make it possible to identify who the suffering sinners are meant to be. Usurers are considered violent because, as Dante's Virgil explains in Canto XI, usurers sin against Art, and Art is the Grandchild of God. Relevant lines from \\"The Inferno\\" Canto XVII with explanations (Mandelbaum translation) :So I went on alone and even farther (43) :Along the seventh circle’s outer margin, :To where the melancholy people sat. :Despondency was bursting from their eyes; (46) :This side, then that, their hands kept fending off, :At times the flames, at times the burning soil: :Not otherwise do dogs in summer-now (49) :With muzzle, now with paw-when they are bitten :By fleas or gnats or by the sharp gadfly. :When I had set my eyes upon the faces (52) :Of some on who the painful fire falls, :I recognized no one; but I did notice :That from the neck of each a purse was hung (55) :That had a special color or an emblem, :And their eyes seemed to feast upon these pouches. :Looking about-when I had come among them- (58) :I saw a yellow purse with azure on it :That had the face and manner of a lion. :Then, as I let my eyes move further on, (61) :I saw another purse that was bloodred, :And it displayed a goose more white than butter. :And one who had an azure, pregnant sow (This person is Reginaldo, because a sow azure on a field argent is the coat of arms of the Scrovegni family.) :Inscribed as emblem on his white pouch, said :To me: “What are you doing in this pit? :Now be off; and since you’re still alive, (67) :Remember that my neighbor Vitaliano :Shall yet sit here, upon my left hand side. :Among these Florentines, I’m Paduan; (70) :I often hear them thunder in my ears, :Shouting, ‘Now let the sovereign cavalier, :The one who’ll bring the purse with three goats, come!’” (73) :At this he slewed his mouth, and then he stuck :His tongue out, like an ox that licks his nose.

The other was Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart.  Biography  Karl was born in Vienna. His schooling, in Prague, was under Franz Xaver Niemetschek and František Xaver Dušek, and he became a gifted pianist. Before he finished his schooling, however, he left for Livorno in 1797 to begin his apprenticeship with a trading firm. He planned to open a piano store in the following years, but the project failed for lack of funds. He moved to Milan in 1805 and studied music with Bonifazio Asioli, though he gave up his studies in 1810 to become an official in the service of the Austrian financial administration and the governmental accounting department in Milan. He also served as official translator for Italian for the Austrian Court Chamber.Michael Lorenz: \\"An Unknown Mozart Work\\", Vienna 2012 He owned a house in the village of Caversaccio in Valmorea, Province of Como; he appreciated the amenities of the place and the wholesomeness of the water. He bequeathed the house to the town, which is stated on a plaque dedicated to him. The Town Hall keeps a copy of the will. He also frequently attended events related to his father until his death in Milan in 1858. Like his brother, he neither married nor had children, and the Mozart family line thus died with him.

This article provides a detailed list of the cities and towns along the Euphrates River in order of country. Cities in Turkey Location of Elazığ Province The Euphrates is formed by the union of two branches, the Karasu or Kara River (the western Euphrates), which rises in eastern Turkey north of Erzurum, and the Murat (the eastern Euphrates). These rivers merge in the Elazığ Province of Turkey, where the river is dammed in several places such as the Keban Dam, the Karakaya Dam, Atatürk Dam, the Birecik Dam, and Karkamis Dam. Beneath the lakes of these dams are ancient towns like Samsat. Other towns like Elif, Hasanoğlu and Hisar in the Araban district of Gaziantep date back to Roman times. Halfeti, a district of Şanlıurfa, mentioned as “Halpa” in the Urartu inscriptions.http://newspot.byegm.gov.tr/arsiv/2001/july-aug/n15.htm The following is a partial list of other cities and towns in Turkey that border the Euphrates. * Rumkale (Hromgla) * Arulis (Gümüşgün) was an important centre of the Kommagene kingdom * Zeugma known as “Seleukeia Euphrates” in the Hellenistic period * Birecik * Arsameia Cities in Syria Map of Syria The upper reaches of the Euphrates flow through steep canyons and gorges, southeast across Syria, and through Iraq. From west to east, the Euphrates is in Syria joined by the Sajur, the Balikh and the Khabur. Lake Assad is a large lake in Syria on the Euphrates River formed by the construction of the Tabqa Dam in 1973. The sites of Tell Abu Hureyra and Mureybet ancient Mesopotamian cities of the Euphrates, are underneath this lake. There are three dams along the Euphrates in Syria: First, the Baath Dam () is located upstream from the city of Raqqa in Raqqa Governorate, Syria. Second, the Tabqa Dam (), or al- Thawra Dam as it is also named (, literally dam of the revolution) is located upstream from the Baath Dam. Finally, the Tishrin Dam (, literally October Dam) is located east of Aleppo in Aleppo Governorate, Syria and south of the Syro-Turkish border. * Jarabulus—on the border of Turkey and Syria * Maskanah is on Lake Assad * Al-Thawrah * Raqqa * Abu Hamam * Deir ez-Zor District ** Deir ez-Zor ** al-Kasrah ** Al-Busayrah is at the confluence of the Euphrates with the Khabur river. ** Al-Muhasan ** Al-Tabni ** Al-Masrab ** Khasham ** Al-Suwar * Mayadin District ** Mayadin ** Diban ** Al-Quriyah ** Al-Asharah * Abu Kamal District ** Al-Salihiyah ** Al-Jalaa ** Hajin ** Al-Shaafah ** Al- Susah ** Abu Kamal (or Al-Bukamal) - on the border of Syria and Iraq Cities in Iraq Map of Iraq In Iraq, the Euphrates is known as \\"Nahr al Furat\\". As it crosses the Syrian border, the Euphrates flows into Iraq near Al-Qa'im in Al Anbar Province. Between Anah and Haditha, the Haditha Dam creates a large lake, known as Lake Qadisiyah. Between the Syrian border and the town of Hit (in the Heet District),located upstream and which is only above sea level. shoals and rapids make the river commercially unnavigable. Once it reaches Hit, the Euphrates is still only navigable by very shallow-draft boats. After Hit, Ramadi is the next major city along on the Euphrates. In Ramadi, a part of the river is diverted to feed a man-made lake called Lake Habbaniyah. The river then flows through Fallujah, and then a canal intersects with the Euphrates south of Baghdad to link the town of Al-Yusufiyyah (on the Euphrates) with Latifiya (on the Tigris in Baghdad) through the industrial part of Baghdad. Also, Shatt al-Hayy. North of Basra, in southern Iraq, the river merges with the Tigris to form the Shatt al-Arab, this in turn empties into the Persian Gulf. The river used to divide into many channels at Basra, forming an extensive marshland, but the marshes were largely drained by the Saddam Hussein government in the 1990s as a means of driving out the rebellious Marsh Arabs. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the drainage policy has been reversed, but it remains to be seen whether the marshes will recover. * Al Hillah * Al Kifl * Al-Hanaya * Anah * Al Diwaniyah * Fallujah * Haditha * Haqlaniyah * Hīt, Iraq * Iskandariya * Khan al Baghdadi * Kufa (Najaf) * Karbala * Musayyib * Nasiriyah * Al-Qa'im (town) * Ramadi * Rawah * Saddat al Hindiyah * Samawah =Al Anbar Province= The following section lists the cities and town in order along the Euphrates river, within the Al Anbar province.

Among those making appearances in smaller roles are John Gielgud, Robert Morley, Roddy McDowall, James Coburn, Milton Berle, Dana Andrews and Liberace. Plot Young Englishman Dennis Barlow (Robert Morse) wins an airline ticket and visits his uncle Sir Francis Hinsley (John Gielgud) in Los Angeles. Hinsley has worked as a production staffer at a major Hollywood studio for over thirty years. His employer D.J. Jr. (Roddy McDowall) fires Hinsley, despite the old man's faithful dedication to the company. Hinsley commits suicide by hanging himself. Dennis is swayed by a prominent member of the local English expatriate community (Robert Morley) to spend most of the money from his uncle's estate on a socially prestigious burial at Whispering Glades cemetery and mortuary. There, he meets and becomes infatuated with Aimée Thanatogenos (Anjanette Comer), a hopelessly naive and idealistic cosmetician who says she was named after Aimee Semple McPherson. Chief embalmer Mr. Joyboy (Rod Steiger) is also an admirer, but although Aimée respects him professionally, she doesn't have any romantic feelings toward him. Somewhat overwhelmed by the services offered at Whispering Glades, Dennis is led through the various burial options available to his uncle by a well- versed Whispering Glades \\"counselor,\\" Mr. Starker (Liberace). Aimée's idol is the Reverend Wilbur Glenworthy (Jonathan Winters), owner of Whispering Glades. Aimée worships the solemn and pious reverend, but in private he is a calculating businessman who regards Whispering Glades as just a business venture. To raise money, Dennis begins working at Happier Hunting Grounds, a local pet cemetery run by the reverend's brother Henry Glenworthy (also played by Winters), who has lately been fired by the movie studio as well. Dennis courts Aimée with poetry, which fascinates her though she fails to recognize famous verses. When Aimée asks whether Dennis wrote these passages, he changes the subject. Dennis dares not let Aimée find out where he works since she considers the pet cemetery to be sacrilegious. Aimée is increasingly frustrated by Dennis' cynical and disrespectful attitude toward Whispering Glades and is shocked at his suggestion that they marry and live on her income when she gets a promotion. So, acting on advice given by Guru Brahmin (Lionel Stander), actually a drunken staff writer at a newspaper, she accepts a dinner invitation from Mr. Joyboy, who secured her promotion. Thoughts of a serious relationship with Mr. Joyboy are dismissed when she sees his bizarre and unhealthy relationship with his morbidly obese mother (Ayllene Gibbons) whose only interest is food. Again acting on the advice of Guru Brahmin, she becomes engaged to Dennis. She invites him to her home, a partially finished house built on a cliff, condemned and abandoned due to the danger of landslides. He cuts the visit short, alarmed at occasional ominous trembling and Aimée's lack of concern over her own safety. Dennis and Henry Glenworthy meet their neighbor, a boy genius (Paul Williams) with an interest in rocketry, and they let him set up a lab at the pet cemetery. Mr. Joyboy brings in his pet myna bird to be buried and discovers the identity of his rival. He agrees to have the bird shot into orbit by one of the neighbor's rockets, instead of being buried. Mr. Joyboy brings Aimée to the ceremony and she is outraged when she sees Dennis performing the service; this greatly pleases Mr. Joyboy. Reverend Glenworthy, seeing little profit in the cemetery once the plots have been filled, decides to convert it into a retirement home, but is unable to proceed without a plan for dealing with the bodies interred there. When he learns of his brother's idea of sending bodies into orbit, he recognizes it as a solution to his own problem. He proceeds to obtain surplus rockets by hosting an orgy at Whispering Glades with top Air Force brass as guests of honor. Dennis, in a desperate attempt to reconcile with Aimée, tells her that Whispering Glades is to be shut down. She flees, but is afraid that what Dennis told her might be true. Aimée seeks out Mr. Joyboy for comfort, but he has been called to the cemetery to prepare a body to be launched into orbit, an ex-astronaut nicknamed \\"The Condor\\". She tracks down Guru Brahmin in a bar, but he drunkenly advises her to jump out a window. Finally, she flees to the cemetery and finds Reverend Glenworthy, who confirms Dennis' story and tries to seduce her with promises of continued employment with higher pay at the new facility. Wholly distraught, since her faith in everything she held sacred has been shattered, she attaches herself to an embalming machine and dies peacefully. Mr. Joyboy finds her body, but is afraid to report it due to scandal, so he calls Dennis to arrange disposal in the pet cemetery's crematorium. Dennis agrees, but only if Mr. Joyboy gives him a first-class ticket back to England and all the cash he can lay his hands on. Dennis also imposes the condition that Aimée be placed in the casket rocket headed for space instead of the ex-astronaut, whose body is relinquished to the pet crematorium. After the televised funeral ceremony and launch, Dennis is seen boarding the first-class section of a plane back to England.

When Waugh demanded complete veto rights over the finished product, the project was scrapped. During his stay in Los Angeles, Waugh became fascinated by the American obsession with the funeral industry, inspiring him to write first a lengthy journal article on the Forest Lawn cemetery and its founder Dr, Hubert Eaton and then his 1948 novel The Loved One. In the following years, numerous people attempted unsuccessfully to produce a filmed version of Waugh's novel, including the Spanish surrealist filmmaker Luis Buñuel and the comic writer/director Elaine May. Production The film was shot in and around the Los Angeles area with Hollywood, the Hollywood Hills, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles International Airport and Burbank among the locations. \\"Whispering Glades\\" was drawn from Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale with the exterior and interior scenes shot mostly at Greystone Mansion. The condemned house scene was filmed at the house under construction at 3847 Oakfield Dr. in Sherman Oaks.

In that same year, the Tilling Group bought an interest in the company and from that year till 1929 Hants & Dorset grow rapidly.The History of Hants & Dorset in Southampton Southampton & District Transport Heritage Trust In 1929, the Southern Railway took up its option to buy shares, under the terms of the Road & Rail Transport Act 1928, when the four railway companies were able to invest in bus operators. By the late 1920s and early 1930s, the network of Hants & Dorset bus services was largely complete. Hants & Dorset operated buses in Bournemouth, Poole, Southampton, Lymington, Fareham and Winchester. Hants & Dorset replaced the trams operated by Poole Corporation in 1934.Corporation and Company vie for Poole Transport Rights Commercial Motor 9 November 1934 page 76 Nationalisation The Southern Railway's half-share in Hants & Dorset passed to the government-owned Transport Holding Company (THC) when the railway company was nationalised in 1948. British Automobile Traction sold its shares to the Tilling Group in 1942, who in turn sold out to British Associated Transport in 1949, and thus Hants & Dorset became 100% government owned. =Common management and merger= Preserved Bristol VR in the poppy red livery in Winchester in November 2008 The THC's successor inspired a reorganisation in 1964 that saw Hants & Dorset and northern neighbour Wilts & Dorset fall under common management, at Hants & Dorset’s head office in Bournemouth.Hants & Wilts merger Commercial Motor 31 January 1964 page 28 A year earlier, Wilts & Dorset had taken over a large independent, Silver Star of Porton Down. As part of the THC’s early rationalisation, Wilts & Dorset had previously, in 1950, taken over the Basingstoke operator Venture, which had passed to the Red & White group five years earlier and which, following Red & White’s voluntary nationalisation, had in turn passed to the THC. Upon both Hants & Dorset and Wilts & Dorset passing to the National Bus Company (NBC) on 1 January 1969, as a result of the Transport Act 1968, the operators merged in 1972 under the Hants & Dorset name and management. Rather than Hants & Dorset's green, the enlarged operation adopted a fleet livery of National poppy red, similar to Wilts & Dorset's. The new operation covered routes from Pewsey in the north, Poole to Fareham in the south, Basingstoke in the east, and Shaftesbury and Warminster in the west. A year later, the substantial Winchester operator R Chisnell & Sons (t/a King Alfred) passed to Hants & Dorset, along with an eclectic mix of vehicles, most of which were withdrawn from service as non- standard. Chisnell had operated Winchester city services and a country service to Basingstoke. Hants & Dorset took over the services operated by Western National in Swanage in 1974. Hants & Dorset had a reputation among NBC subsidiaries as somewhat loss-making. While routes in the Poole-Bournemouth, Southampton, Basingstoke and Salisbury areas made reasonable returns, those elsewhere were weaker. The impact of the private car throughout the 1960s and 1970s together with successive withdrawals and fares revisions further weakened what had now become marginal rural services. During the 1980s, Hants & Dorset's financial position was so precarious that it had to be propped up by an inter-company loan from fellow NBC subsidiary Amalgamated Passenger Transport Ltd in order to remain solvent.Hants & Dorset Motor Services Ltd, annual report and accounts filed with the Registrar of Companies (various dates) =Provincial= Preserved Leyland National in Provincial livery in October 2008 NBC acquired the Gosport & Fareham Omnibus Co (trading as Provincial) in 1970. It passed under the head office control of Hants & Dorset but Provincial remained a separate entity, in part under its own control, owing to the terms of a 1929 Act under which it was established. Provincial retained a green livery. =Market analysis= In the late 1970s and early 1980s, in order to match supply and demand without undue cross subsidy, Hants & Dorset like other NBC subsidiaries embarked on a number of market analysis projects. These helped identify viable networks where the local authorities concerned, which by now not only had the power to subsidise bus services but were actually facing resultant financial constraints, could subsidise additional mileage. MAP, as it was known, emerged from the Midland Red company in 1977 and was applied throughout Hants & Dorset's territory, culminating in redrafted timetables and an attempt at fostering local support through the use of sub-brands identifiable to specific, local markets. These were: :South Wessex (Poole, Bournemouth and Lymington) :Wiltsway (Salisbury and surrounding areas) :Winton Line (Winchester) :Venture (Basingstoke) :South Hants (Southampton) :New Provincial or Provincial Joint Services (Hants & Dorset Fareham and Gosport & Fareham operations) Depots At its height, Hants & Dorset operated from garages at Andover, Basingstoke, Blandford Forum, Bournemouth, Eastleigh, Fareham, Lymington, Pewsey, Poole, Ringwood, Salisbury, Southampton, Swanage and Winchester.

The goal was the formation of units that could better serve their local markets, although later splits were to ensure a successful privatisation.

Provincial was acquired by FirstGroup as First Provincial, then merged into First Hampshire & Dorset in 2003. Finally, the former Hants & Dorset operations in Basingstoke, Winchester and Southampton became Hampshire Bus, whose head office was in Eastleigh. Of the three, Hampshire Bus was the weakest, yet this was one of the first companies to sell under the privatisation of the National Bus Company, in April 1987.

The rules of duplicate Scrabble can vary between different languages and different associations. Some of the general principles of duplicate are Toronto Scrabble club website # The arbiter draws seven random tiles at the start of the game. He announces them to the players who draw the same seven letters. The players are given an allotted time to write their chosen word on a slip of paper which will be collected by a runner and handed to an arbiter. The player is obligated to record the score and the position of his word, and the highest scoring word is placed on the board. Hence every player is faced with the same situation at the same time, and no player has any advantage because of the letters selections. # An invalid word scores zero points. # There must always be at least one vowel and one consonant. If the seven letters do not contain one vowel and one consonant, they are put back in the bag and seven new letters are chosen. If there are no more consonants or no more vowels in the bag, the game ends. # At the end of the game, the player who has scored the most points is declared the winner. This score can also be expressed as a percentage (by dividing by the total of all the best plays) or as a negative, for example 790 out of 800 would be -10 (or 98.75%). Variations ; Thinking time : To make the game more difficult, the thinking time can be reduced. The standard thinking time in French is 3 minutes. Similar to chess, blitz games are played where the player only has 1 minute to make his moves. \\"Semi-rapid\\" games are also played with two minutes to make a move. ; Number of players : Duplicate Scrabble can be played in pairs where the two players agree on which solution they will submit. The French World Scrabble Championship by pairs has been played every year since 1975. A duplicate pairs competition is also part of the Romanian national championship.

Curriculum =International Baccalaureate= Middle Years Programme The International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Programme (MYP) is an educational programme intended for students aged approximately 11 to 16 (grades 6–10 in international schools, the United States, Canada and Australia). Thus, in the United States the programme is often taught throughout the middle school years and the first two years of high school. Typically, middle schools and high schools work in coordination with each other when the programme can not be entirely hosted within one combined school. However, Willams Middle School, in Tampa, Florida, and later, Herbert Ammons Middle School in Miami, Florida, have been granted the authority to host the a full MYP curriculum in only grades 6, 7, and 8. The full programme lasts five years although more limited programmes can be adopted with permission from the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Official MYP documentation is available from the IBO in English, French, Spanish and Chinese. The IBO contends that the MYP programme naturally prepares students for the IB Diploma Programme (DP) and there are significant parallels in structure and philosophy. Diploma Programme The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (DP) is an educational programme examined in one of three languages (English, French or Spanish) and is a university entrance course. It is taught in 2,075 schools, often in international schools, in 125 countries (as of 2007). More than half of the schools offering the Diploma Programme are state funded schools. The programme, administered by the International Baccalaureate Organization, is the most widely recognized pre-university educational programme.

Soon after she was spotted by U-604 which was searching for the convoy. The U-boat pursued the ship for more than 12 hours before firing a spread of three torpedoes at 03:48 on 25 August. One struck the ship, which stopped. At 03:56 U-604 hit her again and the ship sank after two boiler explosions. All the crew except two managed to abandon ship in two lifeboats, which set sail for Ireland, and the 62 men were later picked up by . =Capira & Bronxville= At 10.05 hours on 31 August U-609 fired torpedoes at Convoy SC-97 and sank two ships. The first was Capira, a 5,625-ton merchant ship owned by United States Lines, but flagged in Panama. The ship, loaded with trucks, tractors, steel mats, bulldozers, and 250 bags of US mail, was struck in the engine room, which immediately flooded. The ship sank in 20 minutes, killing five of the crew, but 36 men and 13 armed guards escaped in lifeboats and rafts. Of these, 33 were soon picked up by the British rescue ship Perth, and the remaining 16 by a corvette. The second ship was Bronxville, a 4,663-ton Norwegian merchant ship carrying general cargo, including 531 tons of explosives. All 39 hands survived and were picked up by the British rescue ship Perth. The next day, 1 September, U-756 was sunk with all hands by depth charges from the corvette . =Attack on Convoy ON-127= Convoy ON 127 comprised 32 ships, escorted by the Canadian Escort Group C-4 consisting of the destroyers and , and four s; , , , and . It was first sighted on 9 September 1942 by U-584, which lost contact during the night, but U-96 sighted the convoy again around noon on the next day. Elisabeth van Belgie, Sveve & F.J. Wolfe Between 16:31 and 16:33 U-96 fired four torpedoes at four ships and hit three. The 4,241 ton Belgian merchant ship Elisabeth van Belgie sank with the loss of one man from her crew of 56. When Sveve, a 6,313-ton Norwegian tanker in Admiralty service as a Royal Fleet Auxiliary was hit the subsequent explosion destroyed bulkheads, opened holes on the starboard side, and wrecked the steering gear. With the ship immobile and flooding, the 37 crew and two gunners abandoned ship in four lifeboats. They were picked up within the hour by HMCS Sherbrooke, which then attempted to scuttle the wreck with shell fire. Eventually the ship was reboarded by four of the crew and four men from the corvette who succeeded in sinking her. The third ship hit, the 12,190-ton British tanker F.J. Wolfe was damaged, but able to continue with the convoy. Empire Oil U-659 attacked south-west of Iceland, at 21:10 on 10 September, and hit the 8,029 ton British tanker Empire Oil with two torpedoes, stopping her. All her crew of 53 survived, as the master, 12 crewmen and 6 gunners were picked up by HMCS St. Croix, and 29 crewmen and 5 gunners by HMCS Ottawa. At 01:47 the next day, U-584 sank the drifting Empire Oil with two more torpedoes. After her strike U-659 was counter-attacked by the convoy escorts and seriously damaged. She was forced to abort the patrol and returned to France. Marit II At 00:16 on 11 September U-404 fired three torpedoes and one hit the 7,417-ton Norwegian tanker Marit II. U-608 also fired torpedoes at 00:20 and claimed a hit. Marit II stopped, but after inspecting the damage, she continued and rejoined the convoy on 12 September. She was later repaired in New York and returned to service in February 1943. Fjordaas U-218 fired five torpedoes between 01:35 and 01:40 on 11 September, and struck the 7,361-ton Norwegian tanker Fjordaas on the port side amidships opening a hole. The crew abandoned ship in two lifeboats, but remained close by as the master, first mate and chief engineer inspected the damage. Her engines and steering gear were intact, so the crew boarded and managed to take her back to Glasgow, arriving on 15 September. Delães At 11:50 on 11 September U-96 attempted to stop the 415-ton neutral Portuguese three-masted fishing schooner Delães by firing three shots from her deck gun across her bow. U-96 then sank the vessel with shells when it did not stop. The Germans claimed to see no neutrality markings, that it had steered a suspicious course close to convoy ON-127, and believed they heard ASDIC signals from the ship. All 54 of the crew survived. Hindanger At 19:25 hours on 11 September the 4,884 ton Norwegian merchant ship Hindanger was torpedoed by U-584. One man was killed, and the rest of the crew of 41 abandoned ship. The survivors were picked up by HMCS Amherst, which reported that she sank the wreck with gunfire and a depth charge at 23:12. However, it is possible that the scuttling was unsuccessful, and the ship was actually sunk at 05:34 hours on 12 September by two torpedoes by U-608. Daghild At 06:17 on 12 September U-404 fired three torpedoes, and struck the 9,272 ton Norwegian tanker Daghild with one, making a hole in her side. However, she reached St. John's for repairs, and then proceeded to New York for further work. Empire Moonbeam & Hektoria At 01:05 on 12 September, U-211 fired torpedoes, and damaged two British ships; the 6,849 ton merchant ship Empire Moonbeam was hit once, and the 13,797-ton whale factory ship Hektoria twice. Both vessels were sunk by U-608 later that day. Hektoria was sunk at 03:51 with the loss of one crewman, while the master, 76 crewmen and eight gunners were picked up by . Empire Moonbeam was sunk at 04:59 with the loss of three of her crew, while the master, 44 crewmen, six gunners and one passenger were also picked up by Arvida. Stone Street At 14:36 on 13 September U-594 fired a spread of three torpedoes at the 6,131-ton merchant ship Stone Street, owned by the Waterman Steamship Corporation of Mobile, Alabama, but sailing under the Panamanian flag. The ship was about from the main convoy having developed problems with her boilers. One torpedo hit the ship in the engine room, and she listed and finally sank at 15:50. The master, 39 crewmen and 12 armed guards abandoned ship in a lifeboat and raft. Eleven crewmen and two armed guards were lost. The U-boat surfaced and took the survivors on board to be questioned, and provided them with supplies of whiskey, food, cigarettes and matches before returning all but the master (who was kept as a prisoner) to their lifeboats. They were picked up on 19 September by the merchant ship Irish Larch. HMCS Ottawa At 02:05 on 14 September U-91 fired two torpedoes at a destroyer and observed a hit. Then they saw another destroyer, made a full circle, and fired another torpedo at 02:15, which hit amidships and caused the ship to explode and sink immediately. They thought that they had sunk two destroyers, but in fact it was , which was hit twice. Only 67 of her crew of 181 survived. By now though the convoy was within range of aircraft from Newfoundland and the escorts were reinforced by the destroyers and , forcing the U-boats break off their attacks and disperse. =Olaf Fostenes= At 09:21 on 18 September, the unescorted 2,994-ton Norwegian merchant ship Olaf Fostenes was hit by one of two torpedoes fired by U-380 on her starboard side. Another torpedo struck on her port side at 11:20 and sank her without loss. The crew of 36 abandoned ship in two lifeboats. The U-boat surfaced and asked for the master, but were told that he had been lost. The survivors set sail for Newfoundland, were spotted by an aircraft on 26 September, and soon picked up by . =Esso Williamsburg= On 18 September at 01:16, about south of Cape Farewell, Greenland, U-211 sighted the unescorted 11,237 ton American tanker Esso Williamsburg loaded with of Navy special fuel oil en route from Aruba to Reykjavík. The U-boat fired two torpedoes at the tanker, but missed, and then lost contact due to very poor visibility. U-211 eventually reacquired her target, and at 00:26 on 23 September, fired a torpedo which struck her amidships, causing a violent explosion which set the ship on fire. Ten minutes later, another torpedo was fired but missed. At 01:05, a third torpedo struck the tanker on the starboard side amidships, engulfing the entire ship in flames. The tanker broke in two and U-211 left the scene. On 3 October U-254 discovered an abandoned and burnt out tanker—the drifting wreck of Esso Williamsburg. The U-boat finished her off with two torpedoes. None of the 60 crew (8 officers, 34 men and 18 armed guards) survived, despite U-254s report that all but one lifeboat had been launched. =New York and HMS Veteran= At 23:57 on 25 September U-96 fired two torpedoes at Convoy RB-1 south-east of Cape Farewell, and both hit the 4,989-ton passenger ship New York. At 01.25 on 26 September, U-91 sank New York with a single torpedo. Thirteen of her crew of 64 were picked up by the destroyer , which itself was torpedoed by U-404 at 10:36 the same day, and sank immediately, killing all 237 on board.

Rather than merely sue the nightclub, Chesley sued the entire aluminum electrical wire industry, blaming them for the fire. The aggressive and unprecedented tactic of seeking enterprise liability for an entire industry worked, winning $49 million in verdicts and settlements. Individual defendants settled for about a million dollars in the face of Chesley waving gruesome photos of fire victims rather than risk going to trial and losing much more, though those who did defend themselves often won. Chesley won billions of dollars for his clients in other mass torts, representing clients suing Pan Am over the Lockerbie terrorist attack and clients suing Dow Corning in controversial breast implant litigation. Chesley was one of the \\"inner circle\\" of the plaintiffs' bar that negotiated the controversial $246 billion tobacco settlement on behalf of state governments, and settlements against the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati for sexual abuse. He was Pro Bono Counsel in the Jewish material claims against German, Austrian, and Swiss financial institutions. In May 2008, President George W. Bush appointed Chesley to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel. Chesley is a Life Board Member of the NAACP and was for five years Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of Cincinnati. Controversy Chesley was named in a lawsuit related to the settlement of fen-phen litigation in Kentucky. Former clients sued Chesley and three other plaintiffs' attorneys for allegedly breaching their duties by diverting most of a $200 million settlement fund to themselves with only one third to the plaintiffs. Judge Joseph F. Bamberger approved the settlement, but resigned when it was revealed that he was paid $5000 a month as a director of a charitable entity funded by the settlement and directed by the attorneys.\\"Investigation of Bamberger warranted\\" (editorial). Cincinnati Enquirer. March 1, 2006.\\"A blistering rebuke\\" (editorial). Cincinnati Post. March 1, 2006. Chesley, who collected a $20.5 million fee for negotiating the settlement, maintained that he was not co-counsel for the plaintiffs and was not aware that the attorneys were deceiving their clients and that he therefore owed no duty to the 440 plaintiffs Disbarment and retirement On February 22, 2011, Kentucky trial commissioner William L. Graham issued an order recommending Chesley be disbarred for his actions. The Kentucky Bar Association's board of governors accepted a trial commissioner's recommendation on June 14, which called for disbarment and restitution of $7.6 million to plaintiffs. It was determined that Chesley violated several ethic rules, namely, \\"charging unreasonable fees; failing to document his contingency fee arrangement in writing; improperly dividing legal fees with attorneys from different firms; ratifying the misconduct of his cocounsel; representing clients with conflicting interests; making false statements to courts; making false statements in disciplinary proceedings; and general deceit in the distribution of client funds.\\" In the course of seeking to evade judgments against him, Chesley made several below-market transactions to his wife -- acts the 6th Circuit described as \\"red flags.\\"McGirr v. Rehme, Case No. 17-3519 (6th Cir. May 31, 2018), available at http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/18a0101p-06.pdf The Kentucky Supreme Court disbarred Chesley on March 21, 2013, unanimously voting to uphold the 2011 recommendation. Chesley faced disbarment in Ohio due to reciprocal agreements between the two states; however, he opted to voluntarily retire from the practice of law in Ohio instead of go through the state's disciplinary process. The practical effect of his retirement in Ohio is the same as if he had been disbarred – Chesley will never be able to practice law in the state again. On November 18, 2013, Chesley was removed from the list of attorneys allowed to practice law before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Van Trump, was an American pioneering mountaineer and writer who lived in the state of Washington. He is best known for the first ascent of Mount Rainier in 1870. Van Trump was born in Lancaster, Ohio on December 18, 1838. His father, Philadelph Van Trump, and his maternal grandfather, Philemon Beecher, represented Ohio districts in the US House of Representatives. He was educated at Kenyon College and the New York University. In 1867 he moved to Washington Territory as the private secretary to Marshall F. Moore, the seventh governor of the territory. Moore was Van Trump's brother-in-law. Van Trump first saw Mount Rainier in August, 1867, and later remembered: Van Trump and General Hazard Stevens made the first documented successful climb of Mount Rainier on August 17, 1870. They climbed the mountain via the Gibraltar route. He climbed the mountain at least five other times. Van Trump guided John Muir to the summit of Mount Rainier in 1888. Muir describes this climb in a chapter of his book Steep Trails. Muir and Van Trump kept in touch after the climb. Van Trump joined the Sierra Club in 1893 making him one of their first members outside California. He later served on the Sierra Club committee that campaigned for the creation of Mount Rainier National Park. After his wife, Cynthia, died in 1907, Van Trump took a position greeting tourists at a summer tent camp at Indian Henry's Hunting Ground at Mt Rainier. He served briefly as a seasonal ranger and spent winters with the Longmire family. Failing health caused him to relocate to New York in 1915 to spend his final days with relatives.Aubrey L Haines, Mountain Fever: Historic Conquests of Rainier UW Press, 1999, 203-04.

Previous MP  The seat had become vacant on 27 February 1982, when the constituency's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Sir Ronald Bell, died at the age of 67. He had been Beaconsfield's MP since the constituency was created for the February 1974 general election, having previously been MP for South Buckinghamshire since 1950. Bell had first entered Parliament at the Newport by-election in 1945, but lost that seat two months later at the 1945 general election.  Candidates  The Conservative candidate was Tim Smith, aged 34, who had been the surprise winner of the 1977 Ashfield by-election, where he overturned a Labour Party majority of nearly 23,000 votes. However, he lost the Ashfield seat at the 1979 general election, and was seeking to return to Parliament. The SDP-Liberal Alliance chose 40-year-old Paul Tyler, who had been Liberal Party MP for Bodmin from February 1974 to October 1974. The Labour Party selected as its candidate an unknown and untested 29-year-old barrister called Tony Blair, an aspiring politician who had been advised by Labour MP Tom Pendry to seek the party's nomination to gain political experience. Three other candidates stood, including Tom Keen, from the Campaign for a More Prosperous Britain, who held the record for the most candidacies in a single general election, and 78-year-old by-election veteran Bill Boaks, an eccentric campaigner for road safety, who usually described himself as \\"Air, Road, Public Safety, White Resident\\" or \\"Democratic Monarchist, Public Safety, White Resident\\". On this occasion, he chose the latter label.  Result  Beaconsfield is one of the safest seats held by the Conservative Party, and a Conservative victory was expected. The real fight was for second place; the Liberal candidate had finished a close third in 1979. Labour fought to remain the main opposition party for the seat. In the March 1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election, SDP's Roy Jenkins won a traditionally Conservative seat for the Alliance, with Labour, previously the main challengers in Hillhead, in third place. With SDP winning three of four by- elections since its formation in March 1981, The Glasgow Herald speculated that the new party threatened the Conservatives' hold on Beaconsfield. However, in the intervening weeks the Falklands War began. The 53% turnout was almost 20 percentage points below 1979's, and unusually low for a by-election. Smith held the seat for the Conservatives, with a share of the vote comparable to the general election. The Glasgow Heralds William Russell stated that the outcome \\"firmly endorsed\\" the First Thatcher Ministry's conduct of the war. Party chairman Cecil Parkinson claimed that the result was better than he had expected. Tyler increased the Alliance's share from 17.1% for Liberals in 1979 to 26.8%. Russell agreed with Liberal Whip Alan Beith's claim that the more than 9% increase was much better than expected, writing that \\"the Alliance bandwagon may have been temporally stalled\\" during the war, but the result had some positives for the Alliance.. Labour's vote was nearly halved from 20.2% in 1979 to 10.4%, and Blair lost his deposit. Russell described Blair (\\"a very good candidate\\") finishing in third place \\"a disaster\\" for Labour. The journalist attributed the poor outcome to \\"internal squabbling of the past year between Left and Right\\".  Aftermath  Smith held the seat until the 1997 general election, when in March 1997 he was forced to stand down at the last minute over the cash-for-questions affair. He was replaced by Dominic Grieve. Tyler was a senior campaign organiser for the Alliance at further elections in the 1980s, and returned to Parliament at the 1992 general election, as MP for North Cornwall. He stood down in 2005, and was made a life peer. Despite the party's poor showing Blair was regarded as having fought a good campaign, and he was selected as Labour candidate for the newly created safe seat of Sedgefield in County Durham. He won Sedgefield at the 1983 general election, and after a successful career in opposition he won the Labour Party leadership election in 1994. He led Labour to a landslide victory at the 1997 general election, and became Prime Minister on 2 May 1997, a position he held until 27 June 2007.

He is best known for being the longest-serving president of the University of Michigan, from 1871 to 1909. He represented the transition from small college life to nationally-oriented universities. Under his energetic leadership, Michigan gained prominence as an elite public university. Angell is often cited by school administrators for providing the vision that the university should provide \\"an uncommon education for the common man.\\" Angell was also president of the University of Vermont from 1866 to 1871 and helped that small school recover from its financial difficulties brought on by the Civil War. Throughout the war, he was the editor of The Providence Journal and was a consistent vocal supporter of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. Angell served in diplomatic posts as America's minister to China from 1880 to 1881 and then to Turkey from 1897 to 1898. On his mission to China, he was the primary American negotiator of the Angell Treaty of 1880 that curtailed the emigration of laborers to the United States, as well as a second treaty restricting the trade in opium. In Turkey, he was responsible for the protection of American missionaries during the unrest following the massacre of Armenians. Angell was a member of a prominent Yankee family in Rhode Island and numerous descendants became senior academics.  Early life  James Burrill Angell was born January 7, 1829, in Scituate, Rhode Island, the eldest of eight children of Andrew Aldrich Angell and Amy Aldrich, who themselves were distantly related; he was named after a former senator, James Burrill. The Angells had been a prominent family in and around Providence, Rhode Island, since its founding in 1636 by Roger Williams and his companion Thomas Angell. Though scant, there is evidence suggesting Thomas Angell's ancestors were relations of Henry I of England. Thomas Angell's grandson had settled the farm where James was born in 1710, the same year he founded the Angell Tavern, where Scituate's leaders held town meetings after its incorporation in 1730, and where men such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and the Marquis de Lafayette stayed during the Revolutionary War. Angell's grandfather built an inn on the site in 1810, and Angell credited his boyhood interaction with the travelers who passed through for some of his later success, saying, \\"... the knowledge of men I gained by the observations and experiences of my boyhood in the country tavern has been of the greatest service. ... The eminent political speakers were always entertained at our table, and some of them were very helpful friends in my later life.\\" The building burned down in 1862, and the land was later submerged during the creation of the Scituate Reservoir. = Education = Angell attended the local school until the age of eight, when his parents placed him with a Quaker tutor who taught him arithmetic and surveying. At twelve, he left home to attend a seminary in Seekonk, Massachusetts, in order to study Latin, but after one term went to study at the Smithville Seminary, where he stayed until the age of fourteen. Unsure what career path to take, he had worked on the family farm for two summers, and also unsuccessfully attempted to find clerk jobs with Providence businesses. When his father informed him that he had the financial means to pay for college, Angell decided to attend Brown University. A year too young to enroll, he went first to University Grammar School in Providence, where one of his instructors was Henry S. Frieze, who would later serve as acting president of the University of Michigan while Angell was abroad on diplomatic assignments. In 1845, Angell began studying at Brown, which had a total of seven instructors on the faculty at the time. He graduated in 1849 and obtained part-time jobs working as an assistant librarian at the university and tutoring a boy whose eyesight prevented him from reading. In 1850, Angell came down with a cold and sore throat, but he refused to give his throat any rest from the daily exertion of reading aloud to his pupil. The resultant damage to his throat made extended speaking difficult for the rest of his life. Portrait of James Burrill Angell as a young man. = Travels = While Angell was recuperating, the father of his friend Rowland Hazard II, whose own grandson Rowland Hazard III would later be instrumental in the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, suggested that Angell accompany Hazard on an upcoming winter tour of the South he was undertaking to help alleviate a lung ailment. The trip, which began on October 5, 1850, lasted seven and a half months and took Angell and Hazard throughout much of the South. The young men were introduced to the realities of slavery, including a whipping and a slave auction that Angell called \\"the most repulsive and disgusting spectacle we had ever seen\\". Upon his return, Angell had planned to attend Andover Theological Seminary and take up a career as a minister. A throat specialist, however, advised him to avoid any work that would require extended public speaking, and he instead found work in the office of Ellis S. Chesbrough, the city engineer of Boston. His brief tenure there ended when his friend Rowland Hazard, still suffering from lung ailments, invited him on another trip, this time to Europe. The pair traveled first to France, arriving just three weeks after Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte had staged a coup d'état, then later to Italy and Austria. While in Vienna, he received a letter from Francis Wayland, the president of Brown University, offering him a choice of jobs as chairman of either the Civil Engineering or Modern Language Department, with a year and a half of continued study in Europe. He chose the latter, and went to Paris for several months to study French, then to Braunschweig, Germany to study German, finally returning home in the summer of 1853.  Professor and editor  When Angell began his tenure as chair of the modern languages department at Brown University, President Wayland was in the midst of reorganizing the university away from its traditional roots. Additional study was offered in areas such as modern languages and engineering, Angell's own areas of interest, and students were given greater freedom to choose elective courses. Extension classes were initiated to bring instruction to the wider community, and Angell gave lectures on his experiences in Europe and on the topic of education. Among his own students, Angell singled out as especially memorable two future U.S. Secretaries of State, Richard Olney and John Hay. On November 26, 1855, Angell married Sarah Swoope Caswell, the daughter of Alexis Caswell, who was then a professor at Brown and became its president in 1868. Sarah's family was also long-established in New England, and she was a direct descendant of Peregrine White, the first baby born in Plymouth Colony. The couple had a son, Alexis Caswell Angell, on April 26, 1857. Wayland grew frustrated with a lack of funding for his reforms and resigned as president in 1855, and his successor, Barnas Sears, reversed many of the reforms. The study of modern languages was de-emphasized, leaving Angell unsatisfied with teaching duties that were now limited to only one-year courses. He began writing articles for The Providence Journal starting in 1854 and took over full responsibility for the editorial pages in 1859. After the editor and part-owner, Henry B. Anthony, was elected to the United States Senate in 1858, he proposed that Angell replace him as editor. Angell resigned his professorship in 1860 to become the full-time editor of the paper. Angell allied himself with the radical wing of the new Republican Party, and lent the paper's backing to the 1860 gubernatorial candidacy of abolitionist Republican nominee Seth Padelford, which failed when a coalition concerned about the economic effects of angering the South instead led to the election of fellow Republican William Sprague. In the presidential contest, Angell felt that Rhode Island's interests would be best served by the nomination of staunch abolitionist William H. Seward as the Republican candidate. But when the somewhat more moderate Abraham Lincoln was nominated, he put the power of the Journal behind Lincoln's candidacy, publishing favorable letters from his former pupil John Hay, who was by then working in Lincoln's law offices. In the end, Lincoln carried Rhode Island, 61.4% to 38.6%. Angell ran the Journal for the entire Civil War, and briefly considered buying it to run as a non-partisan newspaper (an idea which Senator Anthony rejected), but the workload took its toll on his health. In August 1866, when the University of Vermont requested that he come serve as its new president, he accepted the offer and moved to Burlington.  University of Vermont  The Civil War had depleted the University of Vermont of students and the funds that came with them. When he assumed the presidency in 1866, Angell's primary responsibility was to improve both the size of the student body and the university's finances. He oversaw the integration of a state agricultural college formed following passage of the Morrill Act in 1862, which had introduced land-grant colleges in the United States. This effort faced resistance both from classicists worried about the influence of the new college on the quality of education and from farmers who doubted the university curriculum had much to offer them, but Angell was able to build enough trust between the groups that the integration went forward, and both the finances and enrollment began to recover; the latter grew from 31 in 1866 to 67 in 1870. Angell traveled to state and county fairs around Vermont to attract publicity for the university and his fundraising efforts, and also secured donations from prominent alumni such as Henry J. Raymond, founder of The New York Times, and Congressman Thaddeus Stevens. Due to a lack of funds to hire professors, he personally taught the university's courses in history, rhetoric, German, and international law. On May 8, 1869, the Angells had another son, James Rowland Angell, who later served as president of Yale University. On September 3 of that year, the University of Michigan offered Angell its presidency, following the resignation of Erastus Haven that June. He visited Ann Arbor with his wife, but he felt that he had a duty to complete his work at the University of Vermont and declined the offer. Michigan repeated the offer in 1871, his former teacher Henry S. Frieze having served as acting president while the regents searched for a permanent president. This time, Angell felt that the University of Vermont had made enough progress that he could leave it in good conscience, and he accepted the offer. He made a trip to Ann Arbor to deliver his inaugural address at Commencement on June 28, 1871, then returned to Vermont to complete the academic term before moving his family to Ann Arbor in September of that year.  University of Michigan  James B. Angell in 1897. When Angell took over as the third president of the University of Michigan in 1871, it was the largest university in the country, with 1,207 students, 35 faculty members, and an annual budget of $104,000. But it was still more a collection of colleges than an expression of the \\"German model\\" of university that had been envisioned by its first two presidents, Henry Philip Tappan and the recently departed Haven. Over the next 38 years, Angell oversaw growth and innovation that led to him being called \\"the chief architect of the modern state university\\". Unlike Tappan, Angell did not have an overriding vision of the future of education, but he introduced several changes early in his tenure, establishing a scientific course that no longer required Greek, dropping classics from the English course, and greatly expanding the number of elective courses. Michigan had begun admitting women the year before Angell arrived, one of the first large schools to do so, and Angell pushed for its continuation and became known as an advocate for coeducation for the rest of his career. Angell felt it was important for a president to teach courses, and he taught international law during his entire term. = Controversies = Angell's first decade in Ann Arbor was marked by several controversies. One involved his expressions of Christian piety in the course of official business, which drew criticism as aligning the state-funded university too closely with his personal faith. Detroit resident Stephen B. McCracken lodged a complaint in 1873 that said such Christian—and specifically Protestant—favoritism violated the state constitution, to the detriment of Catholics, Jews, spiritualists, and free thinkers. A state senate committee investigated and ultimately cleared Angell and the university, concluding that \\"the teachings of the university are those of a liberal and enlightened Christianity, in the general, highest and best use of the term.\\" Angell recognized the need to make the Christian spirit he wished to cultivate more voluntary and less explicitly Protestant, first by dropping compulsory chapel attendance, then by hiring the university's first Roman Catholic faculty member, Eugene W. Hilgard. The question of whether homeopathic medicine should be taught at the university had been debated for decades before Angell's arrival, and in 1873 the legislature passed a law appointing two professors of homeopathy in the medical school, despite the testimony of Angell and others that doing so would be a great mistake that might ultimately kill the entire department due to the hostility of the medical faculty towards homeopathy. The regents refused to appoint the professors, saying it was impossible to teach both types of medicine in a single department but they would establish a separate school to teach homeopathy if the legislature funded it. Funding for a separate school was provided in 1875, and the School of Homeopathy was created. In spite of his earlier opposition, Angell worked to find qualified professors and to ensure the school provided the best possible instruction, and it coexisted with the medical school until it was closed in 1922. In October 1875, an audit of student laboratory fees in the chemistry department found a shortfall of $831.10, attributable to one of two professors, Silas H. Douglas or Preston B. Rose. Rose at first mortgaged his house to make up the difference, but later Douglas was also found to be responsible; charges and counter-charges were made among the two men, various regents, and President Angell. Douglas was Episcopalian and Rose was Methodist, and their fellow churchmen joined in a bitter public debate over who was to blame. A two-month investigation by the state legislature produced a 740-page report, and the case ultimately went to the Michigan Supreme Court, where Douglas won a judgment against the university in 1881. One historian wrote that \\"no one who examines the voluminous records of the struggle ... can doubt that the University would have been a far stronger institution ... had there been no Douglas-Rose controversy\\". The six-year fight affected Angell as well, with one professor saying he \\"was never quite the same\\" afterwards. = Growth of the university = Angell Hall, dedicated in 1924, on the University of Michigan campus. During his tenure at Michigan, the faculty size grew from 35 to about 400; the student body from 1,100 to over 5,000; the annual budget from $104,000 to over $1,000,000. The following schools or colleges were founded during his tenure: Dentistry, Pharmacy, Music, Nursing, and Architecture & Urban Planning. Concerned about the growing role of professionalism in collegiate sports and a loss of control by faculties over athletics on campus, Angell called for a meeting in 1906 of the presidents of the members of the Western Conference (now the Big Ten). At the Angell Conference, the presidents agreed to restrictions on the number of games, years of student eligibility, and ticket prices. An additional rule targeted Michigan football coach Fielding H. Yost's considerable outside income by requiring coaches be full-time employees of the university. In spite of Angell's efforts to institute more control, Yost convinced a majority of the regents to support him, and Michigan left the athletic conference for nearly a decade rather than abide by the new rules.  Diplomatic posts  Angell put his academic career on hold at several points in order to carry out a variety of diplomatic assignments, including serving as minister to the Qing Empire in China and the Ottoman Empire in Turkey as well as negotiating maritime treaties with Britain and Canada. He remained president of the University of Michigan throughout, but took leaves of absence with acting presidents managing in his place. = Minister to China = In February 1880, Secretary of State William M. Evarts asked Angell to go to China to negotiate changes to the Burlingame Treaty that would reduce the flow of Chinese immigrants into the Pacific United States. Angell was nominated by President Hayes, confirmed by the Senate as minister to China and chairman of the treaty commission on April 9, 1880. Angell left for Peking that June with fellow commissioners John F. Swift and William Henry Trescot, and presented his credentials on August 16, succeeding George Seward. Henry S. Frieze was appointed acting president of the University of Michigan in his absence. The commission negotiated two treaties. The first, formally called the Treaty Regulating Immigration from China and dubbed by historians as the Angell Treaty of 1880, allowed the U.S. to regulate and limit the immigration of Chinese laborers, but not to prohibit it outright. The second was a trade treaty that outlawed the trade of opium and set tonnage dues and tariffs to be the same for both nations. The treaties, collectively, were signed on November 17, 1880, and the other commissioners returned home, leaving Angell in China to fulfill his duties as minister. After a year, he decided to return to academia and left China on October 4, 1881, taking a trip through Europe and returning to Ann Arbor on February 24, 1882. Angell was succeeded in his post by John Russell Young. Most of the provisions that the Angell Treaty had secured were negated by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Scott Act of 1888, which placed much stricter bans on Chinese immigration.112th Congress, = Maritime commissions = In the fall of 1887, President Cleveland appointed Angell to a three-man commission, along with William L. Putnam and Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard, to negotiate with the British government regarding fishing rights off the coast of Canada, which had been a source of misunderstanding between Canada and the U.S. since they were first agreed to in the Treaty of 1818. The results of these negotiations, the Bayard-Chamberlain Treaty, was signed on February 15, 1888, but subsequently failed ratification in the U.S. Senate, whose Republican majority had objected to the formation of the commission in the first place. On November 4, 1895, President Cleveland appointed Angell to the Deep Waterways Commission, along with John E. Russell and Lyman E. Cooley. The commission, created by Congress, was to negotiate an agreement between the U.S. and Canada regarding the creation of a waterway to allow ocean-going traffic between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. They undertook a feasibility study and forwarded proposals for further appropriations to Congress, but little was done, and it was not until 1959 that the St. Lawrence Seaway finally opened. = Minister to Turkey = President McKinley asked Angell to serve as minister to Turkey in April 1897 and he agreed on the condition he could return home after a year if he wished. Angell's nomination encountered brief opposition from Constantinople, first because of reports that he had accused Russia of fomenting unrest in the region, and then because Sultan Abdul Hamid II had confused Angell's Congregationalist faith with the Congregation of Jesuits, of whom he had a poor opinion. These objections were resolved by Angell's denial of the former report and clarification to the Sultan on the latter misunderstanding; the Senate confirmed him and he sailed to Europe on the SS Normandie in July, then on to Constantinople, where he presented his credentials to the Sultan on September 3, succeeding Alexander W. Terrell. The University of Michigan regents appointed Harry Burns Hutchins acting president in his absence, through October 1898. The pressing issue facing Angell in Turkey was the protection of American missionaries during the unrest following the massacre of Armenians that had been carried out over the previous two years, as well as compensation for damage to their properties they claimed were caused by both the deliberate actions and the inaction of Turkish forces. He was mostly unsuccessful on this front, except for negotiating a $50,000 surcharge on a warship the Ottoman Empire was purchasing from an American firm, with the understanding that this would be used to resolve the claims of damages (and which was eventually paid in 1901). Angell blamed this failure in part on the outbreak of the Spanish–American War causing American naval ships to leave the area and remove pressure on the Sultan. Angell and his wife toured the Middle East from January to March 1898, visiting Cairo, Jerusalem, Damascus, Beirut, and Ephesus. President McKinley was disturbed by a request from Angell to send American warships to \\"rattle the Sultan's windows\\"; he feared it would lead to an event like the sinking of the Maine, and approached Oscar S. Straus about taking over the post. Angell himself was becoming discouraged by his inability to win concessions from the Turkish government and submitted his resignation in May. He had his final audience with the Sultan on August 5 and left his post on August 13, traveling home by way of Greece, Italy, Switzerland, and France.  Later years  Graves of James and Sarah Angell Angell's wife, Sarah Caswell Angell, died on December 17, 1903. In 1905, Angell submitted his resignation to the Board of Regents, feeling that at his age, he may be losing the qualifications for his position, but the board refused to accept it. By 1909, he had been in office for 38 years and this time the Regents accepted his resignation. . Angell's health began to decline while on a tour of Europe in the summer of 1911, when he suffered a stroke of paralysis in Germany following an exhausting excursion to Russia. He recovered sufficiently to return to Ann Arbor within a month, but his lingering weakness was blamed for a bout of pneumonia in September 1913. On January 24, 1916, he had a stroke that affected his eyesight, leaving him unable to read, and he grew weaker until he contracted pneumonia again. He died a few days later, April 1, 1916, and was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery on April 3, with a line of university students formed on each side of the streets as his funeral cortege traveled through Ann Arbor. Legacy Angell's historic legacy is based on the transition of Michigan from a small local state college to a major national University featuring state-of-the-art research. He was a transitional figure, maintaining the small-college paternalistic interest in the welfare of individual students, and endorsing the traditional small-college mission to promote civility and character building. He introduced a broader mission including admission by merit; coeducation; teaching large classes by lecture; and an increasing emphasis on graduate studies. He introduced a broad curriculum ranging from the humanities to the social sciences, sciences and engineering, as well as traditional and modern professional fields. He appealed to the Michigan public for financial support, and provided a model that was followed by other ambitious university presidents. His moderation, natural tact, and political astuteness strengthened his leadership role, and his diverse background in foreign languages, literature, civil engineering, and newspaper work facilitated his approaches to every major interest group in the state. However, Angell was not as dynamic or innovative as the younger generation such as Charles W. Eliot, Daniel Coit Gilman, and William Rainey Harper. By 1909 he was obsolete in terms of the state-of-the-art in world-class universities, and was even accused of provincialism, inbreeding, and complacency. Benjamin G.

He was named All-Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). In 1967–68 as a junior, he again led the 18-8 Bearcats in both scoring (16.3 ppg) and rebounding (12.3 rpg). In his senior year of 1968–69, for the third consecutive season he paced the team in both scoring (16.1 ppg) and rebounding (12.6 rpg) as the Bearcats went 17-9. He was again named All-MVC. For his career, Roberson ranks fourth in all-time career rebounding average (12.4), behind only Oscar Robertson, Jack Twyman and Connie Dierking. NBA career Roberson was selected in the first round (15th overall) of the 1969 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA and the New York Nets of the ABA. A 6'9\\" and center/forward, he helped the Lakers win the 1969–70 NBA Western Division with a 46-36 record and advance to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the New York Knicks in seven games. With Wilt Chamberlain limited to 12 games due to a knee injury, Roberson helped shore up the Lakers' front line and he saw significant playing time. In 74 games, he averaged 27.1 minutes per game, 8.7 points per game (ppg)and 9.1 rebounds per game (rpg). He scored a season- and then career-high 26 points on February 8, 1970, against the San Diego Rockets. The following season, 1970–71 and with the Lakers and with Chamberlain healthy, Roberson's playing time decreased to 65 games and 14.0 minutes per game, with 5.2 ppg and 4.7 ppg. In the playoffs, the Lakers would reach the Western Conference Finals, but ultimately lose in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. Prior to his third season of 1971–72, he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for a first- round draft pick and two second-round picks. For the Cavaliers that season, he made the switch from center to his more natural position of power forward. As a starter, in 63 games he posted career highs of 35.0 minutes per game, 13.1 ppg and 12.7 rpg. On March 22, 1972, he set a new career-high with 29 points against the Lakers. He especially showed in one game what a force he was as a rebounder. He will go down as Damir Donlagic's hero and mentor. On March 4, 1972, he grabbed 25 rebounds in one game, a team record that still stands and was finally tied in 2014 by Anderson Varejão. The following season, 1972–73, his stat line was much the same although he primarily again played center as he averaged 12.6 ppg and 11.2 rpg with a career-best 2.2 assists per game. He also excelled on defense, as no center scored more than 22 points in a game against him the entire season, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Prior to the 1973–74 season, he was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers. In 69 games he averaged just under 30 minutes per game, averaging a new career-best 13.5 ppg to go with 10.2 rpg. An early-season article in Sports Illustrated stated of Roberson, \\"Despite being one of the NBA's shortest centers, and perhaps its lightest, he has been the Blazer most responsible for the team's turnabout. . . Roberson has already missed five entire games, plus all but three minutes of another, with a leg injury. In his absences, Portland's record is 2-4. With Roberson on full-time duty, the Blazers are 5-1, the only loss coming last week against the streaking Bulls, who made Portland their 11th straight victim. No center has scored more than 14 points against Roberson, and more important, his Dave Cowens-like quickness and agility at stepping out from the middle and pop-switching on smaller, supposedly faster men have allowed the Blazers to employ an aggressive switching defense. In games started by Roberson, Portland has given up an average of 102 points, 10.3 fewer than last season. 'I'd be bulljiving myself if I thought I could stand in the middle and block a lot of shots the way the real big dudes do,' says Roberson. 'I've got to come out and play the small guys. You know, face-to-face. I got to get up on 'em and spread out so they can't drive by or pass around me to the big guy I've switched off. Being active like that means that I have to take some risks with my body. I don't think I'm injury prone. It's just the way I play that causes me to get hurt sometimes'.\\" On February 12, 1974, he exploded for a new career-high 37 points in one game against the Phoenix Suns. However, after the one season in Portland, Roberson was on the move again, this time traded to the New Orleans Jazz for the 1974–75 season, his sixth season in the NBA and fourth team. But injuries again limited him, this time to just 16 games, and 7.4 ppg and 7.4 rpg. In 1975–76 he was on the move again after being waived by the Jazz and signing with the Kansas City Kings. With the Kings, he ties his career-best of 74 games, but averaged only 9.6 minutes per game with 2.5 ppg and 3.1. His seventh season was his last in the NBA In seven seasons he averaged 9.0 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. He played in 423 games and had a .440 field goal percentage, .585 free throw percentage, 3,826 points, 3,522 rebounds and 591 assists.

Born in Serbia, he was a naturalized U.S. citizen.\\"Justice Blackmun and the Little People\\", Mary Meehan, The Human Life Review, Summer 2004 Early life Vuitch was born in Serbia to a peasant family. His father died when he was young, and his mother made a living growing potatoes and beans. Vuitch won a full scholarship to the University of Budapest, and received his medical degree in 1939. He served as a conscript in the Hungarian army during World War II. After the war, he practiced surgery and gynecology in Skopje, where he was also an instructor at the medical school. He married American Florence Robinson and with her help was able to immigrate to the United States in 1955. He settled in the Washington, DC area, initially charging $100 to $200 for an illegal abortion. Court victory In 1969,Open City for Abortion, Time, November 21, 1969 Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled that District of Columbia law was unconstitutionally vague because it permitted abortions only to preserve a mother's \\"life or health,\\" without clearly defining those terms. Gesell wrote that the word \\"health\\" provided \\"no clear standard to guide either the doctor, the jury or the court.\\"\\"Ambivalence on Abortion\\", Time, May 3, 1971 Gesell dismissed an indictment against Vuitch. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed with the ruling, holding that the standard was clear. But Justice Hugo Black, in the majority opinion, included language that limited enforcement of the D.C. law, as well as similar laws: \\"Health includes psychological as well as physical well-being.\\" Black's ruling also changed how the law was to be enforced by shifting the burden of proof. Rather than being incumbent upon the physician to prove that the abortion had been medically necessary, Black put the burden on the prosecution to prove that the abortion had not been necessary. If the prosecution did not sufficiently prove that the woman's \\"life or health\\" was not in danger, a trial judge would be required to set aside a guilty verdict.U.S. Supreme Court, UNITED STATES v. VUITCH, 402 U.S. 62 (1971) Vuitch was pleased with the outcome of the case, saying, \\"This is a big step forward. Now the government lawyer will be in the position of challenging my medical decision. What are the jury members going to decide when a lawyer tries to tell them that the doctor is wrong about a medical matter?\\" Vuitch performed roughly 1,000 abortions annually in his illegal practice, three blocks from the White House. However, Vuitch said that his abortions were purely done for medical reasons. After Roe After Roe vs. Wade, Vuitch ran into trouble in his abortion practice, leading to numerous malpractice suits and public disgrace. In 1984, WDVM-TV, Washington, D.C. won the Peabody Award for its investigation of Vuitch. The investigation found that Vuitch's practice had been cited for a multitude of violations, such as in 1980 for dirty instruments and lab specimens being refrigerated with food; in 1981 for taking patients to Vuitch's home overnight and having expired drugs; in 1982 for unlicensed drug distribution and mixing dirty and clean surgical instruments and for a patient sent home though she was passing red urine and had a catheter still inside her body; in 1983 for having anesthetic drugs \\"not freshly prepared and yellowish in color\\". The investigator also noted that despite these violations, the city kept renewing the clinic's license until 1982, after which Vuitch just operated without one. The story, by Mark Feldstein, noted a patient who said that Vuitch had operated on her without anesthesia. Feldstein also reported on a 17-year-old patient who had been sent home with instructions to return with $400 before Vuitch would complete her abortion. Though Vuitch had told her not to go to a hospital, she was taken to an emergency room after she collapsed. She gave birth to a live premature baby, of six months gestation, who subsequently died. Feldstein also provided a female co-worker with a vial of his own urine. She took the specimen to Vuitch's clinic, where staff told her she was pregnant and offered an abortion. Vuitch did little to help his public image when he said on- camera, \\"This is not the only lacerated uterus in 15 years. I lacerated uteruses and other surgeons lacerated. And perforated. And this and that.\\" One lawsuit came from the family of a 32-year-old abortion patient who died in his unlicensed clinic.Washington Post, April 29, 1986 Vuitch died at age 78 at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, MD after suffering a stroke. \\"Dr. Milan Vuitch, 78, Fighter for Abortion Rights,\\" Linda Greenhouse, New York Times, April 11, 1993 References Category:1915 births Category:1993 deaths Category:American abortion providers Category:Serbian emigrants to the United States Category:People from Washington, D.C.

He previously served under Sun Ce, Sun Quan's elder brother and predecessor. Life Qin Song was from Guangling Commandery, which is around present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu. Sometime around the late 190s, Qin Song, along with Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong and Chen Duan (陳端), pledged allegiance to the warlord Sun Ce, who had recently conquered the territories in the Jiangdong region. Qin Song became an adviser to Sun Ce.(彭城張昭、廣陵張紘、秦松、陳端等為謀主。) Sanguozhi vol. 46.(初，紘同郡秦松字文表，陳端字子正，並與紘見待於孫策，參與謀謨。各早卒。) Sanguozhi vol. 53. Qin Song continued serving under Sun Quan after Sun Ce's death in the year 200. Around 208, before the Battle of Red Cliffs, Sun Quan called for a meeting with all his subjects to discuss how to deal with an impending invasion by a rival warlord, Cao Cao. Qin Song, Zhang Zhao and many others urged Sun Quan to surrender to Cao Cao because they believed that they stood no chance against Cao Cao in a war. Sun Quan did not want to surrender to Cao Cao, and he hardened his decision to go to war with Cao Cao after Lu Su and Zhou Yu convinced him to do so. He privately told Zhou Yu that he was very disappointed with Zhang Zhao and Qin Song for urging him to surrender to Cao Cao, because he felt that they were more concerned about protecting their families and personal interests than about his well- being.(權撫背曰：「公瑾，卿言至此，甚合孤心。子布、元表諸人，各顧妻子，挾持私慮，深失所望，獨卿與子敬與孤同耳，此天以卿二人贊孤也。五萬兵難卒合，已選三萬人，船糧戰具俱辦，卿與子敬、程公便在前發，孤當續發人衆，多載資糧，為卿後援。卿能辦之者誠決，邂逅不如意，便還就孤，孤當與孟德決之。」) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54.(孫權與陸遜論周瑜、魯肅及蒙曰：「 ... 孤普請諸將，咨問所宜，無適先對，至子布、文表，俱言宜遣使脩檄迎之，子敬即駮言不可，勸孤急呼公瑾，付任以衆，逆而擊之，此二快也。 ... 」) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

(November 1835 - April 10, 1865) was a Kazakh scholar, ethnographer, historian and participant in The Great Game. He is regarded as the father of modern Kazakh historiography and ethnography. The Kazakh Academy of Sciences is named after him. His name is written Chokan Valikhanov in English based on the transliteration of the Russian spelling of his name, which he used himself. Childhood Shoqan in 1847, upon enrolling in the Omsk Military AcademyHe was born in November 1835 in the newly developed Aman-Karagai district within the Kushmurun fort in what is nowadays the Kostanay Province of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Shoqan was a fourth generation descendant of Ablai Khan, a khan of the Middle jüz. Shoqan's family was very respected by the government of the Russian Empire, and Walikhanov's father was awarded, during his life, six appointments as senior Sultan of Kushmurun okrug, a term as chief Kazakh advisor to the frontier board, a promotion to Colonel, and a separate term as senior Sultan in the Kokshetau okrug. Shoqan spent his youth in his father’s traditional yurt. His father Chingis arranged his son’s early education, enrolling him in 1842 at age six in a small private school, or maktab, which provided a secular education. Here he began his studies of Arabic script, which was widely used as the writing system at that time. At an early age Shoqan moved from his father’s home to the estate of his paternal grandmother Aiganym, in Syrymbet. Shoqan was enrolled in the Siberian Cadet Corps by his grandmother. Walikhanov entered the military academy in Omsk in 1847. After graduating from the Omsk Cadet School, where he read not only Russian but also English literature, Walikhanov traveled extensively in Central Asia in the late 1850s.Futrell, Michael. Dostoyevsky and Islam (And Shoqan Walikhanov). 'The Slavonic and East European Review'. Vol. 57, No. 1 (Jan., 1979), p. 20 It was during his stay in Omsk that Walikhanov first made the acquaintance of Fyodor Dostoevsky. Adult life His work combined military intelligence and geographic exploration and other things. His first successful expedition was his 1855-56 mission to the region of Issyq Köl. He was afterwards called to the capital in St. Petersburg in 1857 to report, and there he was elected to the Russian Geographical Society. The expedition ended following increased suspicions, and they left Kashgar in April 1859. Walikhanov returned to St. Petersburg and became a fixture of the intellectual and cultural life during his short stay (1860 - spring of 1861) in the capital. The young Walikhanov was a staunch proponent of Westernization and critical of the influence of Islam in his homeland. In the words of the ethnographer Yadrintsev, for Walikhanov European civilization represented \\"the new Quran of life.\\" In the spring of 1861 he became seriously ill with tuberculosis and had to leave St. Petersburg. He returned to his native steppe region in hopes of restoring his health. He never returned to St. Petersburg while frequent relapses in his health prevented advances in his career. In letters to his friend Dostoevsky, Walikhanov mentioned several unsuccessful plans to return to St. Petersburg. Walikhanov also mentioned campaigning for a political position in the West-Siberian Governor Generalship, centered in Tobolsk, like his father. In 1862, he successfully ran for senior Sultan, but Governor-General Alexander Duhamel :ru:Дюгамель, Александр Осипович refused to confirm his position due to Walikhanov's health. Portrait of Shoqan Walikhanov made in St. Petersburg by I. A. Kardovsky Soviet commemorative stamp. Walikhanov collected materials on Kazakh judicial practices in 1863. This was part of a government-backed project given by Duhamel, and led to the 1864 Memorandum on Judicial Reform. In 1864, Shoqan was assigned to help with Colonel Cherniaev's continued conquest of Central Asia. Cherniaev’s forces marched west from the fortress of Vernoe (modern-day Almaty). Chernaiev advanced towards the Khanate of Kokand, planning to attack the fort at Aulie-Ata (modern-day Taraz). Shoqan unsuccessfully pushed for a negotiated result without violence. Cherniaev won an easy victory and returned to Vernoe. Shoqan left Chernaiev after the events at Aulie-Ata and, after stopping Vernoe, moved to the village of Sultan Tezek on the Ili River north of Vernoe. Colonel Cherniaev, however, was not unhappy with Walikhanov's work, and recommended him for a promotion. Shoqan spent his last remaining months in the village of Sultan Tezek, eventually marrying Sultan Tezek’s sister, Aisary. During this time, letters of correspondence to General Kolpakovski, military governor of Semipalatinsk oblast, dated between November 1864 through February 1865, addressed Muslim revolts and rebel activity in nearby Qulja. Kolpakovski held such esteem for Shoqan that he offered Shoqan a position in his administration once his health was restored. Unfortunately, Walikhanov succumbed to his illness on April 10, 1865 at the age of 29. He was buried in the nearby cemetery of Kochen-Togan in present-day Almaty Province. N.I. Veselovskii, who in 1904 edited a collection of Walikhanov’s works, said that the short life of Walikhanov was a “meteor flashing across the field of oriental studies.\\"Taken from \\"The Meteor Flash\\", at the Smithsonian Institution site Walikhanov and Dostoevsky Shoqan Walikhanov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky While still in Omsk, Dostoevsky had met Shoqan Walikhanov. In Dostoevsky's opinion, Walikhanov was a brilliant, intrepid person, a scholar and ethnographer, and a talented folklorist. In their correspondence, the two intellectuals admitted their great mutual love and admiration. When Dostoevsky served in Semipalatinsk (now known as Semey), he met Walikhanov once again. The two men were also closely acquainted with renowned geographer Peter Semenov Tian-Shansky and Baron A. E. Wrangel, who came to Semipalatinsk from Petersburg in 1854 to serve as the new district prosecutor. Dostoevsky wrote from Semipalatinsk on 14 December 1856 one of his most enthusiastic letters ever, addressed to his friend Walikhanov: There is a statue of Walikhanov and Dostoevsky in the city of Semey, Kazakhstan, near the local Dostoevsky museum. Major works Walikhanov produced many articles and books devoted to the history and culture of Central Asia. A short list: * \\"Chinese Turkestan and Dzungaria: Walikhanov and other Russian travellers\\", The Russians in Central Asia, London, Edward Stanford, 1865. * Traces of Shamanism among the Kazakhs * Regarding the camps of Kazakh nomads * The Kazakhs * Tengri * Forms of Kazakh Traditional Poesy * Issyk-Kul Travel Journal * Kul-Ju Travel Journal * Notes on Djungars Walikhanov also compiled epic poetry, including \\"Kozy-Korpesh - Bayan-Sulu\\", as well as what he called the Iliad of the Steppe, the Epic of Manas. Walikhanov's report of his trip to Kashgar in 1858-59 remains a valuable account on the situation in Xinjiang in the aftermath of Wali Khan's invasion of the region and on the eve of the Muslim Rebellion of the 1860s. =The Shoqan Walikhanov spring= The Shoqan Walikhanov spring is in the Altyn-Emel National Park. It is located in the Kerbulak district of Almaty region, on the road to the singing Dunes, among the tract at the foot of the Maly Kalkan Mountains. Shoqan Walikhanov names the spring. Walikhanov's path ran from Russia to Kashgaria in 1856, through the territory of what is now the park. The expedition stopped to rest at the spring. Since that time, there has been a folk belief that the water in the spring is healing and can cure many diseases. There is a small stream from which possible to drink water in July and August months, when the spring mostly dries up.

Castello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi was a Florentine nobleman who lived in the late 13th century around the time of Giotto and Dante. He is best known for being a wicked usurer according to Dante in the Divine Comedy. He practiced usury in France and was made a knight upon his return to Florence. Place in Dante's Inferno In Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy poem Inferno, Dante says that he saw Catello in the inner ring of the Seventh Circle of Hell, where the violent are eternally punished. The inner ring of the Seventh Circle is a burning hot desert with a continual rain of fire. The usurers are to be found sitting on the sand, swatting away fire the way that animals swat bugs, and crying. Around their necks are found purses emblazoned with their coats of arms. This, and a bit of research into Dante's time-period, make it possible to identify who the suffering sinners are meant to be. Usurers are considered violent because, as Dante's Virgil explains in Canto XI, usurers sin against Art, and Art is the Grandchild of God.

He is currently Professor of Plant & Microbial Biology in the institution and Editor-in-Chief of the Planta journal. Hydrogen power is considered one of the key ways of producing electricity without continuing to use up fossil fuels. The added bonus of using algae in this way is that they could consume carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In 1998 Professor Anastasios Melis discovered, after following Hans Gaffron's work, that the deprivation of sulfur will cause Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae to switch from producing oxygen to producing hydrogen. The enzyme, hydrogenase, he found was responsible for the reaction, which is normally a temporary emergency survival mechanism used in an oxygen- deprived environment. The enzyme stops functioning when oxygen is produced, however the deprivation of sulphur ensures continuous hydrogen production. Scientists since the 1940s have been trying to get the algae to produce hydrogen in significant quantities; he told media his breakthrough was like \\"striking oil\\". He currently leads an international effort to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis by up to 300% for increased photosynthetic productivity and hydrogen production. He believes that one way for cost- competitiveness is to genetically modify the organisms to increase output. In 2001 he co-founded a company, Melis Energy, in order to exploit his discovery, hoping to get it on the market by 2005. In the autumn of 2001, under his direction, the company built a bio-reactor containing 700 litres of water and algae that produced up to 1 litre of hydrogen per hour. A siphoning system extracted the hydrogen, which is stored in its gaseous state. The company attempted to refine the process and improve its reliability, while also searching for investors so that it can increase production volume. It has since been dissolved. Beyond hydrogen, Dr. Melis pioneered the concept and currently leads the field of “Photosynthetic Bioproducts”. The latter entails a carbon-negative process, whereby natural chemicals, plant essential oils, and biopharmaceutical proteins emanate from photosynthesis, with a single microorganism acting both as photocatalyst and processor, consuming carbon dioxide, and synthesizing and releasing ready to use commodity and specialty products. These products are generated from sunlight, carbon dioxide and water. Melis is recognized for his multiple ground-breaking contributions in the fields of bioenergy, photosynthetic productivity, bio-products generation, plus the design and application of fusion constructs for high-yield protein synthesis, and pioneering work installing entire exogenous metabolic pathways in microalgae and cyanobacteria. → CHRONICLE OF RESEARCH in the MELIS LAB  Publications  Melis has authored more than 280 peer-reviewed Original Research Articles, Reviews, and Book Chapters.  Invited seminars and lectures  Owing to his research contributions, Melis has been invited as a speaker and has delivered more than 180 international and national invited lectures and seminars at academic, conference, government, and industry settings in (alphabetically) Brazil, Canada, Europe (multiple countries), India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Turkey, and the US (multiple states).  Patents  Anastasios Melis has issued overall ten patents, with Melis as the Principal Inventor, and former and current postdocs as co-inventors. Three of these patents were issued for his work on microbial hydrogen production: use of hydrogenase-containing photosynthetic microalgae is covered by US 6,989,252 (2006); modulation of sulfate permease for hydrogen production is covered by US 7,176,005 (2007), and improved photosynthesis efficiency in plants and algae is covered by US 7,745,696 (2010).

Career Person was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 25th round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft and eventually traded to the Chicago White Sox in . In the 1992 MLB expansion draft, the Florida Marlins drafted him 47th overall, he then became a free agent, and signed again with the Marlins. In , Person was traded from the Marlins to the New York Mets, who, in , traded him to the Blue Jays for John Olerud. Person became a Phillie in when the Blue Jays swapped him for Paul Spoljaric. Granted free agency after the season, he joined the Red Sox for a short and unsuccessful stint. Person tried joining the White Sox out of spring training in and , but was unsuccessful. Injuries were the Achilles heel (quite literally), preventing Person from achieving sustained success. Person's most memorable feat came with the Philadelphia Phillies on June 2, 2002. He not only threw five strong innings in which he allowed three hits and one unearned run while striking out five, but he also hit two home runs against the Montreal Expos. The first home run was a grand slam to left field off Bruce Chen with two outs in the first inning; the second was a three-run home run to left field off Masato Yoshii with one out in the fifth inning. In between those home runs, he came up again with the bases loaded and drove a ball far enough for a second slam, but it was foul and he ended up striking out. Person's best season as a pitcher came in when he went 15-7 with a 4.19 ERA and 183 strikeouts in 208 innings. Before Person's grand slam, Jeff Juden was the last Phillies pitcher to hit a grand slam: August 25, , against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Randy Lerch had been the last Phillies pitcher before Person to hit two home runs in a game, a feat that he accomplished on September 30, . While in Philadelphia, Person had his own fan club named \\"Person's People\\".http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/20091020_Mixed_emotions_for_Wolf_Pack.html Person played college baseball for the University of Arkansas.

It was published by Walker Books in 1997. Branford won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers. Walker's North American division Candlewick Press published the first U.S. edition in 1998. Plot summary The story is narrated by a nameless hunting dog, as witness to the English Peasants' Revolt of 1381. She does her best to survive while trying to raise her own puppy Fleabane after the others were brutally mauled to death by a wild cat, tracking her captive owners Rufus and Comfort as they are tried for heresy. Branford's martianist technique (see Craig Raine) creates a more primal narrative voice in contrast with the suspected response of the reader, but themes including maternal affection and honour unite man and dog. One catalog summary: : \\"In 1381 in England, a hunting dog recounts what happens to his beloved master Rufus and his family when they are arrested on suspicion of being part of the peasants' rebellion led by Wat Tyler and the preacher John Ball.\\" Awards Beside winning the Guardian Prize, Branford was a commended runner up for the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.

It is a suburban subdivision, consisting of low-density, single detached dwellings, low-rise apartment buildings and semi- detached houses. As of 2007, the area is home to 3,566 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $58,703, an average dwelling value of $260,050 and a home ownership rate of 51.6%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $318,449. History James Anderson Park The most of the land for the Eastview neighbourhood was annexed by the city between 1950 and 1959, with the remaining southern piece annexed between 1960 and 1969. According to a 1913 map of registered subdivisions, Eastview's land was once identified as an acreage and a small, never-developed subdivision called \\"Megantic Park\\". Another proposed but undeveloped subdivision called \\"Preston Place\\" was in Eastview's southwest corner. Home building began in the area before 1946, but the vast majority of activity occurred between 1961 and 1970. Eastview is unique in that all the streets within it, aside from Arlington Avenue, share the common name of \\"East\\". When the streets were named in 1964, the neighbourhood was on the city's eastern edge, giving its residents a true \\"east view\\". Alvin Buckwold School opened in 1966. Another public elementary school, John Dolan School, was opened in 1977. This school was founded in 1955 as a private school to help children with cognitive difficulties. It was first housed in North Park School; by 1967, it was incorporated into the public school system and moved to a facility on Kilburn Avenue. The school moved again in 1977 to the newly built facility in Eastview. In 2005, St. Thomas School absorbed the student population of St. James School in Nutana Park when the latter school closed. The school was renamed Pope John Paul II School. Government and politics Kistikan Park Eastview exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon—Grasswood. It is currently represented by Kevin Waugh of the Conservative Party of Canada, first elected in 2015. Provincially, Eastview is within the constituency of Saskatoon Eastview. It is currently represented by Corey Tochor of the Saskatchewan Party, first elected in 2011. In Saskatoon's non-partisan municipal politics, Eastview lies within ward 7.

Held during the last week of September since 1982, the United States campaign \\"stresses the importance of ensuring the availability of those unorthodox or unpopular viewpoints to all who wish to read them\\" and the requirement to keep material publicly available so that people can develop their own conclusions and opinions. The international campaign notes individuals \\"persecuted because of the writings that they produce, circulate or read.\\" Some of the events that occur during Banned Book Week are The Virtual Read-Out and The First Amendment Film Festival. History Banned Books Week was founded in 1982 by prominent First Amendment and library activist Judith Krug. Krug said that the Association of American Publishers contacted her with ideas to bring banned books \\"to the attention of the American public\\" after a \\"slew of books\\" had been banned that year. Krug relayed the information to the American Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee and \\"six weeks later we celebrated the first Banned Books Week.\\" Banned Books Week is sponsored by the American Library Association (ALA), the American Booksellers Association, American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression (ABFFE), American Society of Journalists and Authors, Association of American Publishers, National Association of College Stores, and endorsed by the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress. Since 2011, the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) has designated the Wednesday of Banned Books Week as Banned Websites Awareness Day. Their goal is \\"to bring attention to the overly aggressive filtering of educational and social websites used by students and educators.\\" In the AASL's 2012 national longitudinal survey, 94% of respondents said their school used filtering software, with the majority of blocked websites relating to social networking (88%), IM or online chatting (74%), gaming (69%), and video services like YouTube (66%). The AASL's position is that \\"the social aspect of learning\\" is important for students in the 21st century and that many schools go \\"beyond the requirements set forth by the Federal Communications Commission in its Child Internet Protection Act.\\" United States event A Banned Books Week \\"read out\\" at Shimer College It has been held during the last week of September since 1982. Banned Books Week not only encourages readers to examine challenged literary works, but also promotes intellectual freedom in libraries, schools, and bookstores. Its goal is \\"to teach the importance of our First Amendment rights and the power of literature, and to draw attention to the danger that exists when restraints are imposed on the availability of information in a free society.\\" Offering Banned Books Week kits, the ALA sells posters, buttons, and bookmarks to celebrate the event. Many educational facilities also celebrate banned and challenged books during this week, often creating displays and programs around the awareness campaign. Additionally, various booksellers sponsor activities and events in support of Banned Books Week. Some retailers create window displays, while others go further, inviting authors of banned and challenged materials to come speak at their stores, as well as funding annual essay contests about freedom of expression. Educational facilities and booksellers also sponsor \\"read outs,\\" allowing participants to read aloud passages from their favorite banned books. International event Amnesty International also celebrates Banned Books Week by directing attention to individuals \\"persecuted because of the writings that they produce, circulate or read.\\" Its web site documents \\"focus cases\\" annually which show individuals who have been reportedly killed, incarcerated, or otherwise harassed by national authorities around the world, and urge people to \\"take action\\" to help it in partnership with its \\"Urgent Action Network\\" by contacting authorities regarding human rights violations. They also provide updates to cases from previous years, giving a history and current status of people who have been allegedly persecuted for their writings. The cases include individuals from Azerbaijan, China, Cuba, Egypt, Gambia, Iran, Myanmar, Russia, and Sri Lanka. Reception and criticism The event has been praised for celebrating the freedom provided by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Public events where banned and challenged books are read aloud are commonly held to celebrate the event. The international event held by Amnesty International has also been praised for reminding people about the price that some people pay for expressing controversial views. Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby noted that the overwhelming number of books on the list were books that were simply challenged (primarily by parents for violence, language, sexuality, or age-appropriateness), not actually removed. Mitchell Muncy, writing in The Wall Street Journal, has alleged that the censorship being protested in the event does not exist, and that books are not banned in the United States. Camila Alire, a former president of the ALA, responded that Banned Books Week highlights \\"the hundreds of documented attempts to suppress access to information that take place each year across the U.S.,\\" and that \\"when the library is asked to restrict access for others, that does indeed reflect an attempt at censorship.\\" Former ALA Councilor Jessamyn West said: Doug Archer, librarian and past chair of the ALA's Intellectual Freedom Committee, responds that such criticisms do not fairly address the threat of censorship: An American Christian right organization, called Focus on the Family regularly challenges Banned Books Week, claiming that books are not really banned, and that libraries' policies are anti- family. Tom Minnery, vice president of public policy, said, \\"The ALA has irresponsibly perpetrated the 'banned' books lie for too long...Nothing is 'banned,' but every year this organization attempts to intimidate and silence any parent, teacher or librarian who expresses concern about the age- appropriateness of sexually explicit or violent material for schoolchildren.\\" Candi Cushman, Focus on the Family's education analyst, said that \\"parents have every right and responsibility to object to their kids receiving sexually explicit and pro-gay literature without their permission, especially in a school setting\\"; pointing out that the children's book And Tango Makes Three, about same-sex penguin parents, was one of the books at the top of ALA's most- challenged list, she criticized the event for its \\"promotion of homosexuality to...6- or 7-year-old [children] against their will.\\" The anti-gay group Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays (PFOX) has similarly criticized the ALA for not using the event to champion ex-gay books or books opposing same- sex marriage in the United States. Most recently Banned Books Week was criticized by Ruth Graham in Slate who thinks that the rhetoric surrounding the event often conflates issues such as banning books in a public library versus a school library. She also believes it confuses failure to include material in curricula to overall availability in a library. She believes, while we may want to highlight cases of censorship, that we should be celebrating the books having won the war since the overall number of actual censorship events are minimal. In response, Maddie Crum of The Huffington Post writes in defense of Banned Books Week. She states that the celebration of Banned Books Week keeps us conscious of how the right to free expression is not easily won, as we can see around the world where the war for free expression is still being waged. She believes that Banned Books Week is a reminder of the work that organizations such as the ALA do to help train librarians to keep us from sliding from challenging books to banning them.

It was surveyed at the order of the Duke of Bridgewater and was discovered to be high. The hill has a Bronze Age bowl barrow at the top and used to have a beacon on the top of it, with the iron lighter for it being stored in the nearby Church of England Church of St Peter and St Paul, Ellesborough.

In April 2009, Lansdown sold a stake of 4.7% for a sum of £47.2million to put towards the cost of building Bristol City FC's new football stadium, reducing his stake to 22.9%. In 2019 Hargreaves Lansdown suffered reputational damage when trading was suspended on 4 June 2019 in the Woodford Investment Management fund, which Hargreaves Lansdown had been promoting through its Wealth 50 list despite concerns about the fund's investment strategy and underperformance.

Its site is located just to the west of the village of Charterhouse-on-Mendip in the English county of Somerset. Its Latin name may have been Iscalis, but this is far from certain. Based on inscriptions on a pig of Roman lead BRIT. EX. ARG. VEB, meaning \\"British (lead) from the VEB... lead-silver works\\", the Roman name has been reconstructed as Vebriacum (with Iscalis more plausibly placed at Cheddar). It is associated with the Iron Age hill fort, Charterhouse Camp. The Roman landscape has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Mining settlement Site of Roman fort The settlement grew up around the north- western edge of prehistoric lead and silver mines, which were exploited by the Romans. Mendip lead ore had up to 0.4% silver content, which the Romans used to pay the army. Extraction is thought to have begun as early as AD 49 (although the evidence of dateable lead ingots found in the neighbourhood has recently been questioned.) At first the lead and silver industries were tightly controlled by the Roman military (in the south-west, by the Second Legion) and there was a small 'fortlet' adjoining the mines during the 1st century, which may, however, have been little more than a fortified compound for storing lead pigs. After a short time, the extraction of these metals was contracted out to civilian companies, probably because of low silver content. Smelting was undertaken on site where industrial workshops have been excavated, and the metal exported along a minor road to the Fosse Way, and probably through a small inland port at nearby Cheddar. Amphitheatre View of the ancient enclosure and site of Roman town An amphitheatre stood west of the settlement. It is the only one in England to exist at a lead mine and is additional evidence of the importance of Mendip lead to the Romans. It measures 32m x 24.4m and the banks for the seating survive 4.5m above the arena. It was surveyed in 1909. It was probably a place of entertainment for the soldiers at the Roman fort which was established here.

England had comfortably disposed of Wales and Ireland in the earlier matches, whilst Scotland had struggled, drawing with Wales and only just beating the Irish. In the final match however, the Scots outplayed their illustrious opponents who were effectively reduced to 10 men with Jack Charlton hobbling and no substitutes allowed claiming a 3–2 victory, thus becoming \\"World Champions\\" in the words of many enthusiastic Scottish supporters, who invaded and stole much of the pitch after the game. In contrast to later pitch invasions, this was non-violent and resulted in no significant police action. The \\"World Champions\\" idea has since taken more tangible form in the Unofficial Football World Championships. The contest was also important as it formed the first half of the qualifying stages for the 1968 UEFA European Football Championship, a competition England would eventually qualify for in the following 1967–68 British Home Championship and reach the semi-finals, ultimately securing third position overall.

She uses its towns as settings for her works. In 1991, Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times described Morris as \\"one of the most skillful new writers at work in America today\\"; The Washington Post has described her as a \\"superb storyteller\\"; and The Miami Herald has called her \\"one of our finest American writers\\". She has been most often compared to John Steinbeck and Carson McCullers. Although her writing style is different, Morris also has been compared to William Faulkner for her character-driven storytelling. She was a finalist for the National Book Award and PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. As of 2011, Morris has published eight novels, some of which were best-sellers, and numerous short stories. She also has written a play about the insanity trial of Mary Todd Lincoln. Published novels Vanished, Her first novel, was written over 10-year period; only her husband and children knew that she was working at writing. It was rejected by numerous publishers and agents before agent Jean Naggar helped her sell it to Viking Press. It was published in 1988 to favorable reviews and was a finalist for the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. Her 1991 novel A Dangerous Woman was named by Time as one of its Five Best Novels of the Year and as one of the best books of the year by American Library Association (ALA) Library Journal. Based on A Dangerous Woman, Morris won the Barnes and Noble Discover Great New Writers Award. The novel was adapted for a 1993 movie of the same name, which starred Debra Winger, Gabriel Byrne, David Strathairn, Barbara Hershey, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Jake Gyllenhaal. Her 1995 novel (her third) Songs in Ordinary Time, sold one and one-half million copies, was a New York Times Bestseller, and a selection of Oprah's Book Club. It was adapted as a CBS television movie starring Sissy Spacek and Beau Bridges. Her fourth novel, Fiona Range (2000), was published to critical acclaim. A reviewer for The New York Times Book Review stated Morris can \\"bring the ordinary to life with the sheer clarity of vision. She knows how a house with children in it sounds at night, what the heat and bustle in a kitchen feel like before a family dinner and how indiscretions arise in a dining room when everyone is flushed with wine.\\" Morris' fifth novel was entitled A Hole in the Universe (2004) and tells the story of a man returning to his community after having served 25 years in prison for murder. The Washington Post wrote: > \\"Morris is a master at sympathetic portraits of those clinging to the > peripheries of society. And nowhere is her talent more evident than in her > extraordinary new novel, A Hole in the Universe.

He recounts his life after his mother leaves him, his sister and his father in the midst of the Great Depression. The Boston Globe described the book as \\"wonderful and absorbing\\", and The Washington Post wrote \\"The Lost Mother is the quietest, subtlest novel that ever kept me up into the small hours of the night, unable to look away.\\" Morris has said of The Lost Mother: > \\"Inspiration was easy because it was during those same years that my > grandmother abandoned her husband and three children.

The Last Secret depicts the unraveling of the life of an accomplished suburban mother, who discovers her husband's betrayal, known by others, at the time a shameful secret surfaces from her own past. Morris' eighth novel was Light from a Distant Star (2011). It drew comparisons to Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. It tells of a brutal murder and family love. At the center of the novel is 13-year-old Nellie Peck, a girl who wrestles with the meanings of loyalty, love and truth.

There is evidence that Jews have lived in Moravia and Bohemia since as early as the 10th century. As of 2005, there were approximately 4,000 Jews living in the Czech Republic.The Virtual Jewish Library - Jewish population of Czech republic, 2005 Jewish Prague Jews are believed to have settled in Prague as early as the 10th century. The 16th century was a golden age for Jewry in Prague. One of the famous Jewish scholars of the time was Judah Loew ben Bezalel known as the Maharal, who served as a leading rabbi in Prague for most of his life. He is buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery in Josefov, and his grave with its tombstone intact, can still be visited. It is said that the body of Golem (created by the Maharal) lies in the attic of the Old New Synagogue where the genizah of Prague's community is kept. In 1708, Jews accounted for one-quarter of Prague’s population.Prague, The Virtual Jewish History Tour Austro-Hungarian Empire As part of the original Czechoslovakia, and before that the Austro-Hungarian Empire the Jews had a long association with this part of Europe. Throughout the last thousand years there have emerged over 600 Jewish communities in the Kingdom of Bohemia. According to the 1930 census, Czechoslovakia (including Subcarpathian Ruthenia) had a Jewish population of 356,830. First Czechoslovak Republic During the 1890s, most Jews were German-speaking and considered themselves Germans. By the 1930s, German-speaking Jews had been numerically overtaken by assimilated Jews speaking Czech; Zionism also made inroads among the Jews of the periphery (Moravia and the Sudetenland). In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, thousands of Jews came to Prague from small villages and towns in Bohemia, leading to the urbanization of Bohemian Jewish society. Of the 10 million inhabitants of pre-1938 Bohemia and Moravia, Jews composed only about 1% (117,551). Most Jews lived in large cities such as Prague (35,403 Jews, who made up 4.2% of the population), Brno (11,103, 4.2%), and Ostrava (6,865, 5.5%). Antisemitism in the Czech lands was lower than elsewhere and strongly opposed by the national founder and first president, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk (1850–1937), while secularism among both Jews and non-Jews facilitated integration. Nevertheless, there had been anti-Jewish rioting during the birth of the Czechoslovak republic in 1918 and 1920. Following a steep decline in religious observance in the nineteenth century, most Bohemian Jews were ambivalent to religion, although this was less true in Moravia. The Jews of Bohemia had the highest rate of intermarriage in Europe; 43.8% married out of the faith compared to 30% in Moravia. The Holocaust Jews wearing yellow badges in Prague, c. 1942 In contrast to Slovak Jews, who were mostly deported by the First Slovak Republic directly to Auschwitz, Treblinka, and other extermination camps, most Czech Jews were initially deported by the German occupiers with the help of local Czech Nazi collaborators to Theresienstadt concentration camp and only later killed. However, some Czech Jewish children were rescued by Kindertransport and escaped to the United Kingdom and other Allied countries. Some were reunited with their families after the war, while many lost parents and relatives to the concentration camps. It is estimated that of the 118,310 Jews living in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia upon the German invasion in 1939, 26,000 emigrated legally and illegally; 80,000 were murdered by the Nazis; and 10,000 survived the concentration camps. Today Jewish communities associated under the Federation of Jewish communities and their administration within the Czech Republic, 2008 Prague has the most vibrant Jewish life in the entire country; several synagogues operate on regular basis; there are three kindergartens, a Jewish day school, two old age homes, five kosher restaurants, two mikvot, a kosher hotel. Three different Jewish magazines are being issued every month. The Prague Jewish Community officially has about 1,500 members but the real number of Jews in the city is estimated to be much higher; between 7,000 and 15,000. Due to years of prosecution by both the Nazis and the subsequent Communist regime, however, most people do not feel comfortable of being registered as such. Moreover, the Czech society is the most secular in the EU. There are ten small Jewish communities around the country (seven in Bohemia and three in Moravia), the largest one being in Prague, where close to 90% of all Czech Jews live. The umbrella organisation for the Jewish communities and organisations in the country is the Federation of Jewish Communities (Federace židovských obcí, FŽO). Services are regularly held in Prague, Brno, Olomouc, Teplice, Liberec, Pilsen, Karlovy Vary and irregularly in some other cities.

The exact location has not been clearly identified but the possible sites are in the modern ceremonial county of Somerset, England. One of the possible sites is at Gatcombe which was occupied from the middle of the 1st century until at least the fifth century, demonstrated by the coins of Theodosius, Magnus Maximus and Arcadius which have been found. The full extent of the site is unclear, beyond a specific villa but there is some evidence that the site is much more extensive, possibly forming a village or even a town. The second possible site identified is Charterhouse Roman Town. The settlement grew up around the north-western edge of prehistoric lead and silver mines, which were exploited by the Romans. Extraction is thought to have begun as early as AD 49. An amphitheatre stood west of the settlement. It is the only one in England to exist at a lead mine and is additional evidence of the importance of Mendip lead to the Romans. Another suggestion is that Iscalis was at the mouth of the River Axe near Bawdrip. Another possible site is Cheddar Palace.

Steinkraus (1918–2007) was an American food scientist who was well known in food fermentation which led to the growth of soy-based foods. He also was involved in bacterial diseases used in the control of European chafer and Japanese beetles in New York state. Career A native of Minnesota, Steinkraus graduated cum laude (B.A.) from the University of Minnesota in 1939 and earned his Ph.D. in microbiology in 1951 from Iowa State University in 1951. He would stay at Iowa State for one year before joining Cornell University and the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station (NYSAES) in 1952. He was promoted to full professor in 1962 at Cornell and NYSAES and retired as professor emeritus in 1988, although he remained active in his field and at Cornell for many years afterward. During his career, Steinkraus's research would focus on the microbial, chemical, and nutritional changes occurring in fermented foods. At Cornell, the experience of mentoring students who had come from Asia, Central America and Africa to study the microbiology of their native foods prompted Steinkraus to study fermented foods, including tempeh, soy sauce, soy milk, tape, trahanas, idli/dosa and the fermented fish sauces (List of fish sauces; List of fish pastes)and soy products of the Far East, including miso and tofu. He was the first researcher to obtain sporulation of Bacillus popillae in a fermentation medium. He published over 180 scientific papers, edited three books, and earned seven patents. His \\"Handbook of Indigenous Fermented Foods,\\" published in 1983, was the first comprehensive and authoritative book on the subject.

The Zeta Phi Society (ΖΦ) was a fraternal organization founded at the University of Missouri (MU or Mizzou) in Columbia, Missouri in 1870. The society became a chapter of Beta Theta Pi in 1890. It is the oldest fraternity in continuous existence at the University and the first fraternity founded west of the Mississippi River. The Zeta Phi Society =Early History= The driving force behind the creation of Zeta Phi (ΖΦ) was a young university professor named Oren Root II. The son of a university professor and the elder brother of statesman Elihu Root, Professor Root came to the University of Missouri in June 1866 to fill the chair of English Language and Literature. Root had been a member of Sigma Phi, an established eastern fraternity, during his younger days. It is probably no coincidence that Root's fledgling fraternity at Missouri University was given a name similar to that of his college fraternity. In fact, the new society's fraternity pin, adopted in December 1870, closely resembled a Sigma Phi pin, with the Greek letter zeta replacing the sigma superimposed over the letter phi. Some have speculated that Professor Root may have intended that Zeta Phi one day become a chapter of Sigma Phi. For whatever reason, however, the fraternity remained independent for two decades. Minutes from one of the early meetings of the Zeta Phi Society record discussions over whether the group should link up with an eastern fraternity. At the following meeting it was decided that the society would, instead, become the genesis for a western fraternity with the Missouri group as the mother chapter to the organization. The first meeting of Zeta Phi was held in the Union Literary Hall at the University, (now known as Switzler Hall), and was attended by Root and eight students. Those in attendance included Frank M. Houts of Warrensburg, Jacob Linn Ladd of Mexico, Nelson Washington Allen of Allenton, Evans Perry McDonald of Wellington, George Bingham Rollins of Columbia, Robert Franklin Walker of Versailles, Lycurgus A. Marvin of Sedalia, Scott Hayes of Springfield, and Oren Root, Jr. Root initially was not a formal member of the society but was subsequently inducted and is listed as the twelfth name on the rolls of Zeta Phi. Five weeks after the first meeting on December 15, 1870, the society adopted a fraternity color - white, and the previously described badge as its fraternal regalia. Although it was originally intended to be a literary society rather than a Greek-letter fraternity in the modern sense, the ideals of the organization carried many of the precepts of its modern-day counterpart. The first minutes of the society read as follows: \\"There having been some previous understanding with a few young men of the University that a meeting be held for the organization of a secret society, the object of which was to be a social and intellectual culture, as well as close intimacy through life...\\" The society's constitution soon took on these principles and added \\"the perpetuation of brotherly love\\" as the organization's reason for existence. The society met for a time in a third floor room of the old Academic Hall (whose remaining columns now are the centerpiece of Francis Quadrangle), then in Switzler Hall, and finally in a second floor room in a downtown hall. Members adopted secret designations selected from the names of prominent figures in the literary or scientific world and these designations served as a member's chapter identification. Early minutes of the Zeta Phi Society include, for example, references to members known as Julius Caesar, Sir Isaac Newton, Copernicus and others. =Expansion= The members of Zeta Phi soon envisioned the creation of a regional fraternity beyond the bounds of Missouri University, and began the task of organizing additional chapters at nearby universities and colleges. On November 18, 1871, the Sigma chapter of Zeta Phi was chartered at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri, and on December 9, 1872, the Omicron of Zeta Phi was chartered at Washington University in St. Louis. There is some indication that a fourth chapter was planned in Kansas, but no details, other than approval of a charter in old society minutes, are given in surviving records. The William Jewell chapter continued on, apparently somewhat robustly, for the next 15 years until it petitioned out of Zeta Phi to become a chapter of Phi Gamma Delta. The Washington University chapter, however, became extinct after only two years in large part because of opposition from members of the University's faculty. However, the MU chapter continued to flourish and staved off banishment by the University by initiating members of the faculty. Social activities began to carry greater emphasis with the society and the minutes of the March 16, 1878 meeting mention a serenade of four young ladies. The chapter adopted the custom of wearing a badge of mourning upon the death of an alumnus but this appears to have been discontinued by the time Zeta Phi joined Beta Theta Pi. A pinning is also recorded and several young women were actually \\"initiated\\" into the group and given a small pin to wear. A number of distinguished townspeople, in addition to members of the faculty, were also initiated into the society. In 1882, the chapter had only eight active members and had decreased markedly in both size and activity. By 1884, however, memberships had increased to twenty, and a ritual and initiation ceremony were described in the chapter minutes. Zeta Phi received several invitations to unite with national fraternities before it finally became a Beta chapter. Alpha Tau Omega approached the Zeta Phis on January 22, 1880 but was politely rebuffed. On April 24, 1884, the society was solicited by the Sigma Nu fraternity and flatly refused the offer, as the minutes of June 8, 1884 recorded: \\"the Alpha of Zeta Phi positively refuse to unite with Sigma Nu.\\" The Kappa Alpha Order made an offer on January 6, 1886, without success, as did Phi Kappa Psi on May 17, 1886. On June 4, 1885, a petition signed by eighteen active members of the Alpha of Zeta Phi was sent to the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, petitioning to unite with them. According to one source, this desire to join the Betas grew out of close relations with the Alpha Delta Chapter of Beta Theta Pi at Westminster College. The petition was subsequently dropped, however, possibly out of concern for the William Jewell chapter or alumni pressure. When the Westminster Betas inquired some months later, the minutes of January 6, 1886 record Zeta Phi's reply: \\"We inform our committee man to report that we are not anxious to enter.\\" The Zeta Phi Chapter =Affiliation with Beta Theta Pi= No records are available from the period 1886 to 1890 but it appears that the Zeta Phis may have reconsidered a union with Beta Theta Pi during this time. On March 8, 1890, a motion carried in the Alpha of Zeta Phi to become a chapter of Beta Theta Pi pursuant to several special conditions. The petition was granted by the General Fraternity at its convention in the summer of 1890. As noted in the minutes, the conditions were as follows: 1\\\\. That we be known as the Zeta Phi chapter of Beta Theta Pi. 2\\\\. That all active members of this chapter be initiated, and that all alumni of this chapter be admitted into full membership of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity upon acknowledging allegiance to its constitution. 3\\\\. That the active members of this chapter be the sole judges of the new men who shall be initiated into the chapter. The changeover ceremony from a society to a chapter, and the initiation, when all alumni of the society and actives at the university were accepted as Beta, took place at Stone Hall. Following the ceremony, the group adjourned downstairs to what was known as O'Rear's Oyster Parlors for a banquet. The group apparently continued to meet on a regular basis in the Union Literary Building, now as a Beta chapter, and in 1895, began a fund toward the purchase of a chapter house. In 1901, the chapter rented accommodations and began living together for the first time in a two-story rental house at 201 South Ninth Street. The fund for a permanent house continued to grow, however, and in late 1904, only a few months after the formation of the Zeta Phi corporation, a spacious three-story frame house was completed at 714 Missouri Avenue at a cost of $9,000. The chapter lived in the house, one of the first such permanent facilities on campus, from 1905 until 1912. On New Year's Day of the latter year, however, tragedy struck when the building caught fire and burned to the ground. Within months, plans were made for the construction of a larger new house, this one to be built of brick and mortar. A fund drive was started and the monies raised, along with a substantial insurance recovery from the loss of the previous house, enabled the chapter to occupy new premises in 1913 with only a modest mortgage. The chapter's new address, 520 South College Avenue, occupied a site formerly owned by the Kappa Sigma fraternity and the new building with its gabled roof stood out within the Missouri Greek system. In September 1917, the District Chiefs of the General Fraternity met with the trustees of Beta Theta Pi at the International Hotel in Niagara Falls, New York. Their purpose was to decide which chapter of the fraternity would be awarded the first Sisson Trophy. The initial award, which had been established only months before, was an honor to be bestowed on the top chapter in the general fraternity. After a full discussion of a number of chapters, the Chiefs made the following recommendations to the Board, which were recorded in the minutes: \\"The District Chiefs have carefully considered the claims of the several chapters to the Sisson Trophy, to be awarded this year for the first time. They have noted with extreme gratification that, in spite of the disturbed conditions of the past year, several chapters have been considered worthy of this honor. It is the opinion of the Chiefs that the Sisson Trophy, which is to go to the chapter which most nearly approximates the ideal chapter of the fraternity, be awarded to the Missouri chapter, and we do so recommend.\\" =The War Years= The first World War brought the chapter's progress to an abrupt halt. With the demand for manpower on both the war front and at home, most of the chapter's active members either entered the military or went to work on farms or in factories. The June 1918 edition of the Beta Theta Pi Magazine listed 62 Zeta Phis, both actives and alumni, enlisted in the military. Ten did not survive the war. During the war, although a few members remained in school, the chapter house was occupied by the S.A.T.C. (Student Army Training Corps). Ironically, the War Department's newly implemented selective services system was administered by another Zeta Phi, General Enoch Crowder '86, in Washington, D.C. The end of the war brought a prompt reorganization of the chapter, largely due to the efforts of Rogers Crittendon '19 and other concerned alumni. A journal describing chapter rules, ceremonies, officer functions and pledge training proved to be quite useful for the new crop of young men who joined the fraternity at the end of the war. Miss Elizabeth Ransom, the housemother since 1916, resumed her duties following the war. The 1920s were a prosperous and rewarding time for the chapter as its membership excelled both academically and in extra-curricular activities. The chapter had the highest grades among all the fraternities a number of times during this decade and Brother Charles Parker '27 became the second Zeta Phi to win a Rhodes Scholarship. World War II suspended much of the activity at the university and during the war years the chapter's size was reduced considerably. By 1946, however, it was largely business as usual at 520 South College, and the late 1940s saw the chapter take up where it had left off. =Post-Wars= The 1950s boasted five of six Student Union presidents and a number of top athletes as well. To accommodate the expanding group, the annex at 1307 Willson Avenue was purchased in 1958 at a cost of $50,000. The early 1960s saw continuing progress for the chapter, with high grades and back-to-back intramural titles in 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, and 1965. The old house at 520 South College and an adjacent structure were torn down in 1963 to make way for the present main house. A fund drive among alumni and friends raised nearly $200,000, without which the new facility would not have been possible. During the late 1960s, the \\"anti-war\\" movement and the \\"anti- establishment\\" sentiments that followed hurt the fraternity system at the university and elsewhere. As total Greek membership declined, many fraternities were forced to close their doors in the face of falling memberships and poor funding. The Betas, however, weathered the period well and continued to dominate intramurals while maintaining a high academic stature. By the mid-1970s, fraternities again began to gain in popularity and the chapter rode the crest of this wave, winning the coveted \\"triple crown\\"—grades, intramurals, and singing competitions—roughly every other year. =Present day= Zeta Phi solidified their academic and intramural dynasty in the latter half of the 20th century. From the years 1959 to 1999 Zeta Phi placed first in the highest grade point average on campus every year but six, in which they placed second. Between 1974 and 2001 the fraternity won the intramural championship an unprecedented 24 times. The 1980s saw a comeback for the fraternity system that has placed it in the vogue, especially at large midwestern universities such as the University of Missouri. In the 1990s the Zeta Phis maintained their high position on campus, consistently finishing first among fraternities in grade point average and earning a long succession of Don Faurot intramural crowns. In 1993, the Yeckel Library was completed, which was made possible by a $100,000 gift from the widow of Philip J. Yeckel '33. In 2011 and 2012, the Zeta Phi Chapter of Beta Theta Pi at the University of Missouri embarked on an aggressive capital campaign to raise $10 million for a new, state-of-the-art Chapter House.

Life Croizat was born in Torino, Italy to Vittorio Croizat (aka Victor Croizat) and Maria (Marie) Chaley, who had emigrated to Turin from Chambéry, France. In spite of his great aptitude for the natural sciences, Leon studied and received a degree in law from the University of Turin. Croizat and his family (wife Lucia and two children) emigrated to the United States in 1924; an avid artist, Leon worked selling his artwork for several years, but could not succeed economically as a working artist after the stock market crash of 1929. During the 1930s, Croizat found a job identifying plants as part of a topographic inventory performed in the public parks of New York City. During his visits to the Bronx Botanical Gardens, he became acquainted with Dr. E. D. Merrill. When Merrill was appointed director of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University in 1936, he hired Leon as a technical assistant (in 1937.) Croizat became a prolific student and publisher, studying important aspects of the distribution and evolution of biological species. It was during this time that he began to formulate a novel current of thought in evolutionary theory, opposed in some respects to Darwinism, on the evolution and dispersal of biota over space, through time. Croizat during the 1950-1951 Franco-Venezuelan Expedition to the sources of the Orinoco River In 1947, Croizat moved to Venezuela after receiving an invitation from botanist Henri Pittier. Croizat then obtained a position in the Faculty of the Department of Agronomy at the Central University of Venezuela. In 1951 he was promoted and was awarded the title of Professor of Botany and Ecology at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. Between 1951 and 1952 he participated in the Franco-Venezuelan expedition to discover the sources of the Orinoco river. Croizat served with the expedition as a botanist with professor Jose Maria Cruxent. During his time in Venezuela Croizat divorced his first wife. Croizat was later remarried to his second wife Catalina Krishaber, a Hungarian immigrant. In 1953 Croizat gave up all official academic positions to work full-time researching biology. Croizat and his wife Catalina lived in Caracas until 1976. In 1976 they took over as first directors of the “Jardin Botanico Xerofito” in Coro, a city approximately 400 kilometers West of Caracas. Jardin Botanico Xerofito was a botanical garden which they founded together. Croizat and Catalina worked for six years to establish Jardin Botanico Xerofito. Croizat died at Coro on November 30, 1982, of a heart attack. During his life, Croizat has published around 300 scientific papers and seven books, amounting to more than 15,000 printed pages. He was honoured by Venezuela with the Henri Pittier Order of Merit in Conservation, and by the government of Italy with the Order of Merit. Croizat is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, Mabuya croizati.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Concepts Panbiogeographic tracks of the ratite birds, the southern beech Nothofagus, and the New Zealand frog Leiopelma Panbiogeography is a discipline based on the analysis of patterns of distribution of organisms. The method analyzes biogeographic distributions through the drawing of tracks, and derives information from the form and orientation of those tracks. A track is a line connecting collection localities or disjunct areas of a particular taxon. Several individual tracks for unrelated groups of organisms form a generalized ('standard') track, where the individual components are relict fragments of an ancestral, more widespread biota fragmented by geological and/or climatic changes. A node arises from the intersection of two or more generalized tracks Craw RC, Grehan JR, Heads MJ (1999). Panbiogeography: Tracking the History of Life. New York: Oxford University Press. In graph theory a track is equated to a minimum spanning tree connecting all localities by the shortest path. To explain disjunct distributions, Croizat proposed the existence of broadly distributed ancestors that established its range during a period of mobilism, followed by a form- making process over a broad front. Disjunctions are explained as extinctions in the previously continuous range. Orthogenesis is a term used by Croizat, in his words \\"... in a pure mechanistic sense\\",Croizat L (1964). Space, Time, Form: The Biological Synthesis. Caracas: Published by the author. p. 676. which refers to the fact that a variation in form is limited and constrained. Croizat considered organism evolution as a function of time, space and form. Of these three essential factors, space is the one with which biogeography is primarily concerned. However space necessarily interplays with time and form, therefore the three factors are as one of biogeographic concern. Put another way, when evolution is considered to be guided by developmental constraints or by phylogenetic constraints, it is orthogenetic. Although authors belonging to the dispersalist establishment have dismissed Croizat's contributions, others have considered Croizat as one of the most original thinkers of modern comparative biology, whose contributions provided the foundation of a new synthesis between earth and life sciences.

He wrote many books about the Orthodox Church, and about Christianity in Russia, of which the best known is The Russian Religious Renaissance of the Twentieth Century (1963). He worked continuously for the unity of Christians, and from 1935 to 1947 was secretary of the ecumenical Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius, which he helped to found in 1928. Biography Nicolai Michaelovitch Zernov was born in Russia on 9 October 1898 in Moscow. He had a sister, Maria, and was the son of a doctor. He himself began medical studies in Moscow in 1917, but after the Russian revolution and civil war his family fled to the Caucasus. In 1920 they were taken by some British people from Georgia to Istanbul. They made their way to Serbia, and Nicolas graduated in theology at Belgrade University in 1925. In 1926 the family reached Paris. Nicolas was a founder of the Brotherhood of St Seraphim of Sarov, and in Paris from 1926 to 1929 was secretary of the Russian Student Christian Movement, and first editor of their periodical, Vestnik. In 1927 he married Militza Lavrova (1899-1994), who was a doctor. In 1927 and 1928 Zernov organized in Britain two Anglo-Russian Student Conferences, which established strong contacts between English-speaking Christians and Orthodox Christians who had fled Russia after the Russian Revolution of 1917, and in 1928 he became a founder of the Anglican-Orthodox ecumenical group, the Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius. After taking his D. Phil degree at Oxford University in 1932 he served as secretary of the Fellowship from 1935 to 1947. He was an associate of A. M. Allchin, Georges Florovsky and other prominent figures in Anglican-Orthodox relations in the 20th century. In 1947 Zernov gave up his secretaryship of the Fellowship and began teaching in Oxford University, as Spalding Lecturer in Eastern Orthodox Culture. For two short periods he left Oxford, to serve as Principal of the Catholicate College Pathanamthitta in Kerala, India (1953-1954) and as Visiting Professor of Ecumenical Theology, Drew University, New Jersey, USA (1956). From 1959 he was warden of St Gregory and St Macrina House, Oxford. With his wife Militza, he wrote a memoir, \\"За рубежом. Белград- Париж-Оксфорд. Хроника семьи Зерновых, 1921-1972\\" (1973); and in 1979 he published The Fellowship of St Alban and St Sergius: a historical memoir, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Fellowship. He died in Oxford on 25 August 1980. He bequeathed his library to the Library of Foreign Literature in Moscow. His wife died in 1994.

Dubbed \\"The Phantom\\" while at BYU, he was the first BYU football player to be named to a first-team All-America squad.BYU Magazine. During his senior season, Fortie led the nation in total offense for eight weeks, and at the end of the season finished second behind Terry Baker with 1,963 total yards and 14 touchdowns. On September 29, 1962, Fortie ran for 272 yards in a single game in Provo against the George Washington University Colonials. That was the single best running game of any BYU player in school history, until 2016, when Jamaal Williams rushed for 286 yards against Toledo.BYU Official Athletics Site. Fortie's No. 40 was retired after that season, the first BYU student to have that honor.MWC Official Athletic Site , Sept. 25, 2003. In 1962, he ran for 1,149 yards and 14 TDs but more impressively also threw for 814 yards with 7 TDs. He finished 10th in the Heisman Voting. Although Fortie was a quarterback, BYU ran the single wing offense at the time; consequently, Fortie was primarily a running back. He was selected to play in several all-star games after the 1962 season, including the North-South Bowl in Miami, the Hula Bowl, the All-American Game in Tucson, and the Coaches All-American Bowl. After graduation Fortie played one year in the Canadian Football League with the Edmonton Eskimos.

Children of both genders were selected from across the Inca empire for sacrifice in capacocha ceremonies,D'Altroy, Terence N. (2003). The Incas (Reprinted ed.). Oxford: Blackwell Pub. . which were performed at important shrines distributed across the empire, known as \\"huacas\\", or \\"wak'as\\". Capacocha ceremonies took place under several circumstances. Some could be undertaken as the result of key events in the life of the Sapa Inca, the Inca Emperor, such as his ascension to the throne, an illness, his death, the birth of a son. At other times, Capacocha ceremonies were undertaken to stop natural disasters performed as major festivals or processions at important ceremonial sites. The rationale for this type of sacrificial rite has typically been understood as the Inca trying to ensure that humanity's best were sent to join their deities. The children chose for sacrifice in a capacocha ceremony were typically given alcohol and coca leave and deposited at the place of the ceremony. Sacrifice was primarily carried out through four methods: strangulation, a blow to the head, suffocation, or being buried alive while unconscious, though if the ceremony was carried out in a particularly cold place, they could die from hypothermia. Some Spanish records tell of Incas removing victims' hearts, but no evidence of this has been found in the archaeological record; it seems more likely that this practice was witnessed by the Spaniards among the Aztecs and wrongly attributed to the Incas as well.  Ceremony  = Selection of children = Children selected for sacrifice in capacocha ceremonies were of both genders. No region was exempt from the recruitment of these child sacrifices; they could come from any region of the empire. The male victims were no older than ten and girls could be up to age sixteen but must be a virgin when chosen; they had to be perfect, unblemished by even a freckle or scar. While the boys were immediately brought to Cuzco, the young girls, called aclla, taken for sacrifice were often entrusted to the mama-kuna, in the \\"House of Chosen Women\\" (aqlla wasi). Chosen for their looks, the girls were taught to weave and sew here for an extended time. The mama-kuna women were compared to nuns by many Spanish men, as they lived celibate lives, serving the Gods. There were three groups the girls were divided into. Some girls never left and went on to raise the girls brought after them, and the prettiest were sent as tribute. The rest from the girls brought to become Chosen Women became slaves and concubines in Cuzco, for the noblemen. = Capacocha at Cuzco = The capacocha sacrifice started at the capital city of Cuzco, on the order of the Sapa Inca. The first Sapa Inca to do this sacrifice was Pacha Kuti. During the festivities of the Capacocha in Cuzco, it was decided what type and quantity of offerings each shrine or wak'a would receive, of which the Incas maintained a clear record. The tributes were fed well, and those too young to eat would have their mothers with them to breastfeed. This was to ensure that they would be well fed and happy when they prepared to reach the gods. The children were paired off, girl and boy, and dressed finely like little royals. They were paraded around four large statues, of the Creator, the Sun God, the Moon God, and the Thunder God. The Sapa Inca would say to the priests then to divide the children, along with the other sacrifices, in four, for each of the four suyu regions. He would then order the priests to make their sacrifices at their main wak'as. = Sacrifice at the wak'as = After the ceremonies at Cusco, the children, the priests and their entourage of companions undertook the trip back to their communities. When they returned, they did not follow the royal road, or the Inca road, as they had gone, but they had to follow a path in a straight line, possibly following the ceque lines that left Cusco and went to the wakas. This was a long and tedious journey, crossing valleys, rivers and mountains, which could take months. Once the procession reach the waka, forensic evidence suggests that many children (as well as the priests) received coca leaves to chew on in order to give them energy and help them breathe more easily in the high mountains while climbing upward. Once at the summit the young victims would then be administered an intoxicating drink or other substance to either induce sleep or a stupor, ostensibly to let the final ritual go on smoothly. If the ceremony was carried out in a particularly cold place, they could die from hypothermia, in other cases death was provoked in a more violent manner, such is the case of the Aconcagua child, with a strong blow to the head, as well as that of the girl at Sara Sara and the young woman from the snowy Ampato, while the cause of death of the \\"Queen of the Hill\\" was a puncture wound in the right hemithorax, which entered through her back. While in some cases, as in Llullaillaco, the bodies were deposited in a burial chamber and covered with gravel, or, in the case of Cerro El Plomo, the sacrificial victim was wrapped in a complex funerary bundle of several pieces with a specific function and message,Abal, Clara (2001). Cerro Aconcagua: descripción y estudio del material textil. Universidad Nacional de Cuyo EDIUNC, Mendoza. as in the case of Aconcagua. When the sacrifices of children and material offerings were buried, the holes couldn't be made using any metal, but in the ceremony dug out using sharpened sticks. Once dead, the victims would then be buried in a fetal position, wrapped up in a bundle with various artifacts within the bundle or next to it in the same grave . = Non- human sacrifice and offerings = A number of offerings were often left with the sacrificed individuals at the sites of capacocha ceremonies. The human body itself was often finely dressed and clothed in a feathered headdress and other ornamentation such as a necklace or bracelet.Ceruti, Maria Constanza (March 2004). \\"Human Bodies as Objects of Dedication at Inca Mountain Shrines (north-western Argentina)\\". World Archaeology 36 (1): 103*122. The most elaborate artifacts were typically paired human statuettes and llama figurines that have been crafted with gold, silver, and spondylus. The combination of both male and female figurines alongside the use of both gold and silver was likely meant to pay tribute to the male Sun and the female Moon. Several sets of ceramics as well as gold, silver, and bronze pins were relatively commonplace too. A large amount of cloth was a typical find at capacocha sites too. Some objects that often appear such as plates and bowls have often been found in pairs. Alongside these objects are sometimes found food items. All objects, animals, and people sacrificed to a wak'a, not only represented Inca symbols but were also previously legitimized in ceremonies conducted by the emperor himself.Duviols, Pierre (1976). La Capacocha. Allpanchis: Revista del Instituto Pastoral Andino, 9. Historical accounts Guaman Poma (1613) of a child being sacrificed to Mt. Coropuna in Peru. The fullest description of a capacocha comes from Molina who placed it in the context of a monarch’s ascension. He wrote that all of the towns of the empire were called upon to send one or two boys and girls about 10 years old to the capital, along with fine cloth, camelids, and figurines of gold, silver, and shell. The boys and girls were dressed in finery and matched up as if they were married couples. Priests were then dispatched to the four quarters with sacrificial items and orders to make offerings to all wak’a according to their rank. The parties left the city in straight-line paths, deviating for neither mountain nor ravine. At some point, the burdens were transferred to other porters, who continued along the route. The children who could walk would do so, while those who could not were carried by their mothers. The Inca himself traveled the royal road, as did the flocks. Some children were cut open to have their hearts removed and others strangled. Their blood was used as paint on the idolic statues of the gods in the rest of the ceremony. Archaeologically, the evidence to support sacrifices at that scale is lacking. Bauer, In his fieldwork among the wak’as of Cuzco, found surface evidence of human burial at three shrines, but nothing approaching the thousands of victims described in the chronicles has yet been reported. Even so, Molina’s comment that the rituals paid special attention to high peaks has been supported by the archaeological finds described. The principal offerings recovered from those sites – gold, silver, spondylus shell, and children – also nicely match the priest’s account. High-altitude sites Special attention was paid by the Inca to a number of ceremonial wak'a sites at very high elevations. Over 100 ceremonial centers and shrines were built within Inca territories on or near the high summits of the Andes Mountains. These sites were often meant to function both religiously and politically. Some mountains were viewed as origin places or the home to important mountain deities. Building shrines on these mountains both paid homage to the deities and also placed an imperial stamp on areas important to local beliefs, fulfilling both religious and political goals. In a number of instances, typically at the most important of these mountains, these sites contain the mummified remains of children sacrificed in capacocha ceremonies. Capacocha ceremonies at these important locations held a great deal of weight. Inca priests would periodically visit wak'a distributed across the Inca realm and certificate if they still maintained its power or had lost it, on occasions destroying the discredited wak'a. Travel to these sites would have involved a procession of priests, the children who would be sacrificed, and a number of other important individuals throughout the empire. Different peoples would assist with the procession as the group moved throughout the different regions of the empire. These sites were difficult to reach and even more difficult to work on. In order to increase the ease with which these mountaintop locations could be reached, the Incas built staging stations lower on the mountains and also made paths that lead up to the summit. Some preparation would likely have occurred at tambos situated nearby. =Llullaillaco= One of the mummies recovered from Llullaillaco. One particularly noteworthy site was found near the summit of Mount Llullaillaco, a volcano in Argentina that lies near the Chilean border.Grady, Denise (2007-09-11). \\"In Argentina, a Museum Unveils a Long- Frozen Maiden\\". The New York Times. This mountain appears to have been the site of the conclusion of a capacocha ceremony, taking place at an elevation of around 6,739 meters above sea level. In 1999, the mummies of three relatively young individuals were found at the top of the mountain alongside a diverse assemblage of artifacts. Excavations around the main ceremonial structure, a rectangular platform, revealed the burials of a young woman of about 14 years of age, a girl of about 6 years of age, and a boy of about 7 years of age along with over 100 offerings of various materials. Due to the frigid conditions, both the mummies and the materials were incredibly well preserved. Some of the notable artifacts found at the site include a feathered headdress, well-made clothing, a number of ceramics, bowls and spoons made of wood, various food items, figurines made out of gold, silver, and spondylus, and other metal objects such as pins. Due to the incredible preservation of the children, a number of studies could be undertaken from their remains. Hair samples indicate that the diets of the children underwent a momentous change in the year before their deaths. This helps to indicate the care with which children were treated during their travels throughout the empire prior to their ultimate sacrifice. Other changes in the isotopes found in the hair samples indicate that the children began their procession to the mountain several months prior to their death. The preservation of both the human remains and the artifacts associated with them has been an invaluable source of information.

In the Florentine Guelph-Ghibelline conflict, his family was a Ghibelline. He is best known for being a wicked usurer according to Dante in the Divine Comedy. Place in Dante's Inferno In Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy poem Inferno, Dante says that he saw Ciappo in the inner ring of the Seventh Circle of Hell, where the violent are eternally punished. The inner ring of the Seventh Circle is a burning hot desert with a continual rain of fire. The usurers are to be found sitting on the sand, swatting away fire the way that animals swat bugs, and crying. Around their necks are found purses emblazoned with their coats of arms. This, and a bit of research into Dante's time-period, make it possible to identify who the suffering sinners are meant to be. Usurers are considered violent because, as Dante's Virgil explains in Canto XI, usurers sin against Art, and Art is the Grandchild of God. Relevant lines from The Inferno with explanations (Mendelbaum translation) So I went on alone and even farther (43) along the seventh circle's outer margin, to where the melancholy people sat. Despondency was bursting from their eyes; (46) this side, then that, their hands kept fending off, at times the flames, at times the burning soil: Not otherwise do dogs in summer-now (49) with muzzle, now with paw-when they are bitten by fleas or gnats or by the sharp gadfly. When I had set my eyes upon the faces (52) of some on who the painful fire falls, I recognized no one; but I did notice That from the neck of each a purse was hung (55) that had a special color or an emblem, and their eyes seemed to feast upon these pouches. Looking about-when I had come among them- (58) I saw a yellow purse with azure on it that had the face and manner of a lion. Then, as I let my eyes move further on, (61) I saw another purse that was blood-red, and it displayed a goose more white than butter. (This person is Ciappo, because a white goose on a field red was the arms of Ciappo’s family, the Ubriachi. ) And one who had an azure, pregnant sow inscribed as emblem on his white pouch, said io me: “What are you doing in this pit? Now be off; and since you’re still alive, (67) remember that my neighbor Vitaliano shall yet sit here, upon my left hand side. Among these Florentines, I’m Paduan; (70) I often hear them thunder in my ears, shouting, ‘Now let the sovereign cavalier, The one who’ll bring the purse with three goats, come!’” (73) At this he slewed his mouth, and then he stuck his tongue out, like an ox that licks his nose.

The episode aired on March 12, 2007. The plot features the protagonists' escape to Panama while subplots include that of Sara Tancredi, Brad Bellick, Fernando Sucre, Theodore \\"T-Bag\\" Bagwell, Alexander Mahone and Benjamin Miles \\"C-Note\\" Franklin. Regarding the casting of this episode, Paul Adelstein (who plays Paul Kellerman) does not appear in this episode. This is Benjamin Miles \\"C-Note\\" Franklin's last appearance until Rates of Exchange in season 4. Summary The bag containing Charles Westmoreland's millions is passed from hand to hand at the Mexico City International Airport. The chain of custody ends with T-Bag (Robert Knepper). When the airport employee asks T-Bag about the contents of the bag, T-Bag simply gives him a 20 dollar bill and tells him it's none of his business. Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) and Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) are also in the airport. When the three cross paths, T-Bag runs, takes a taxi cab, and rides away. Sucre runs after the cab and tells T-Bag that he really needs the money. Sucre is able to grab the luggage tags, while T-Bag tells the driver to drive faster. When Bellick balks at the luggage tags being shown to him by Sucre and threatens his freedom, Sucre grabs Bellick's gun. Bellick replies that he has Maricruz in a hiding place, with enough food to last for only three weeks. Although he accuses Bellick of bluffing, Bellick produces Maricruz' rosary as proof, and Sucre realizes that he has no choice but to work for Bellick. Bellick and Sucre go to the Mexico City Department of Tourist building. The man at the desk insists that there is no record of Erik Stammel. Sucre tells the agent in Spanish that he does not like \\"that gringo\\" (Bellick) either, but if he cannot find Stammel, then a loved one will die. The man at the desk appears to agree to apprise Sucre of any updates to T-Bag's whereabouts. He later calls Bellick's cell phone, who passes the phone to Sucre. Sucre informs Bellick that T-Bag is en route to Panama City. T-Bag and a prostitute Alex Meneses are making out. When the hour is up, the prostitute wants her money, T-Bag wants her to stay. He's been having her pretend to be Susan, T-Bag's ex. The prostitute wants her money. T-Bag prepares to pay her and insults her. The prostitute replies saying it's no wonder why Susan left him, calling Susan a \\"bitch.\\" She attempts to leave, but T-Bag blocks her exit. She threatens to scream if he doesn't move. In anger T-Bag strangles her to death. A maid later enters T-Bag's hotel room, picks up the wig with a look of disgust on her face. The maid then sees the dead body of the prostitute. T-Bag is on his way out of the hotel with his money, but is spotted by a Mexican police officer. He attempts to escape. FBI Internal Affairs Agent Richard Sullins (Kim Coates) is an interrogation room with Agent Wheeler (Jason Davis) Sullins presents a deal to C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar); his eighteen-year sentence (his original sentence in addition to penalties related to the escape) would become eighteen months. C-Note balks at the offer, noting that the last time an offer was made to him, there was a string attached which he was to be hung at the end of. He further reasons that with Mahone's connections, he would not last eighteen days in custody and holds firm on his demand of being a free man. As C-Note calls for the guard to take him back to his cell, Sullins then offers no jail time, in addition to Witness Protection Program coverage for him and his family. C-Note agrees. C-Note is later taken out of his cell, where he meets Kacee, Dede, and Richard Sullins. Sullins hands C-Note an envelope containing information pertaining to his new identity, as he advises C-Note to stay out of trouble and to attend the court dates. C-Note leaves the Cook County Correctional Facility with his wife and daughter. Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) are aboard a freighter docked in Chicago, Illinois bound for Panama. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) is en route to the docks, as she hears about President Caroline Reynolds' resignation on the radio. Michael calls her, and they conclude it is best to disappear as he had originally planned. FBI Agent Lang (Barbara Eve Harris) is tailing Sara, and informs Agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) of their location. Mahone replies that he will be right there. Sara realizes that she is being tailed by the authorities. Unwilling to lead them to Michael and Lincoln, Sara tells Michael by telephone that she is already aboard the ship and that she loves him. She then stops her car, and approaches Agent Lang with her hands up. She is arrested and read her Miranda Rights, as Mahone expresses frustration that she did not lead them to the brothers. Michael sees police cars with their lights flashing and their alarms blaring. Shocked, Michael wants to pursue her, but Lincoln successfully convinces him that there is nothing he can do to save her. One week passes. Agent Mahone is in an office covered with pictures related to the manhunt. He stares at a calendar littered with memos detailing a timeline of events concerning the Fox River Eight. A concerned Agent Lang enters the room and asks to be apprised of Mahone's progress. Mahone shows Lang copies of sketches recovered from Scofield's hard drive. The sketches are those of Michael's tattoos, which included notations from the Greek Alphabet. The original sketches of the tattoos contained these notations, however they were not included on the actual tattoo. \\"Allen Schweitzer\\", the first tattoo which was used in \\"Allen\\" was \\"alpha\\", and an illustration of Jesus Christ in a rose was omega (the last letter of the Greek Alphabet), in addition to the number \\"617\\". Mahone believes this sketch is the key to the last step in Michael's game plan. After reading through Michael's file, Mahone notices that Michael's mother's name is Christina Rose. He concludes that the sketch found on Michael's hard drive is a pictoral charade for \\"Christina Rose\\", and orders his men to get him a map of Panama, and any information regarding Michael's mother. He also orders to do searches for her in Panama, and call the embassy there to make arrests if they have to. When Lang replies that international laws won't permit such an action, Mahone replies that the Patriot Act will allow it. Mahone later receives a telephone call from Secret Service Agent William Kim. Agent Kim is at a beach, and informs Mahone that C-Note is not dead, but is in fact about to be released. He replies this is impossible and that he is on top of the situation. Kim begs to differ, as Mahone asks his underlings to find Agent Wheeler. Kim is told by a suited man that \\"he'll see you now.\\" Kim boards a row boat, and joins the enigmatic \\"Pad Man\\". When Kim remarks that it is an unusual place to meet, Pad Man verbally replies that a blind spot in surveillance equipment makes it a proper place to discuss the situation. He further says that there will be a \\"change of strategy\\" and mentions \\"SONA\\". Wheeler is in his car in a parking garage, speaking to Agent Sullins on his cell phone. Wheeler is concerned for his safety, as he believes that Mahone will be able to read him and figure out that he is under investigation. When Wheeler asks Sullins about protection, he replies \\"just act normal\\". As Wheeler leaves his car, Mahone suddenly appears. He tells Wheeler that the penalty for traitors is beheading. He further tells Wheeler that he did not do a good job of covering his tracks, as if he wanted it to be known who had betrayed him. Wheeler looks at Mahone with fear and says to his face, \\"You're a killer, Alex.\\" He mentions Mahone's string of crimes, including the deaths of Oscar Shales, David Apolskis, and John Abruzzi, Mahone replies that Wheeler reminds him of a younger version of himself. He advises Wheeler \\"Don't let anyone scare you into doing the wrong thing.\\" Mahone rips the prints pertaining to the manhunt off the walls, and throws them in a trash bag. Kim suddenly appears, and asks \\"Going somewhere, Alex?\\" Kim assures Mahone that he can escape his indictment by going to Panama. He said that the change of strategy involved Theodore Bagwell. Kim further says that T-bag was caught in Mexico to which Mahone asks Kim if he wanted T-Bag killed. Kim replied that he is needed alive, due to a change in strategy. Michael and Lincoln arrive in Cristóbal, Panama. Michael tells Lincoln that there is someone that they need to see. The brothers board a bus, and Lincoln remarks that this is his first bus ride since going to Fox River State Penitentiary. The brothers then go to a small store, where Michael meets an older woman. She remarks that Michael is late, although she recognizes him and gives Michael a small piece of paper with information on where to find Christina Rose. While talking with this woman, Michael refers to Lincoln as a business associate. Michael asks if she has a phone that he can use, and she replies affirmatively. As Michael asks for international assistance to call Sara, Lincoln presses the receiver, and says that making such a call is dangerous. The brothers argue as Michael despairs the loss of Sara. Michael reminds Lincoln of the deaths of other members of the Fox River Eight, as well as the death of Veronica. Lincoln flies into a rage, and the two briefly grapple. After their scuffle, Lincoln reminds Michael that Sara made a choice while Veronica did not, and he had to listen to Veronica die while there was nothing he could do. The brothers reach a dock, where a yacht called the \\"Christina Rose\\" is moored. Meanwhile, Lang calls Mahone, informing him that a boat of the same name was commissioned in Panama. Aboard the yacht, Michael opens the padlock by using the combination \\"617\\", the number on his final tattoo. He surfs the web on his mobile phone, and notes that Sucre has recently posted on europeangoldfinch.net. He said that T-Bag will be at the Fin Del Camino Hotel in Panama City. Michael argues that it is no longer about Westmoreland's money, but the fact that T-Bag has killed and that there is blood on both their hands. Michael remarks that he must be stopped. Lincoln ponders as to how T-Bag knew about Panama. In the meantime, Mahone is at an airport, waiting for a flight to Panama, as he adds the finishing touch to a post on europeangoldfinch.net, which he signs \\"Sucre\\". As Lincoln explores the ship for a short time, he emerges from the cabin, looking to find Michael, when he discovers that he is completely alone. Production The original airdate of the episode was scheduled two weeks after the 19th episode of the season instead of March 12, 2007 as the principal photography of the episode had yet to be finished. Portions of the episode were filmed at Pensacola Beach in Florida with approximately 120 cast and crew members, and 20 extras. The producers selected this particular location over other areas, which included South Padre Island, Texas and Destin, Florida, because \\"of the islands\\" and that it \\"gives you more to look at than just a long stretch of beach.\\" Pensacola Beach was used to represent the Panama area in the final three episodes of the season (oddly enough, Pensacola is less than a hundred miles from Panama City, Florida).

Læraðr is a tree in Norse mythology, often identified with Yggdrasill. It stands at the top of the Valhöll. Two animals, the goat Heiðrún and the hart Eikþyrnir, graze its foliage. Etymology The meaning of Læraðr / Léraðr is unclear. One of the meanings of læ is \\"harm\\", \\"betrayal\\". A possible translation of Læraðr could therefore be \\"arranger of betrayal\\", which would relate to Yggdrasill as the place of Odin's self- sacrifice. Another reading is sometimes suggested, *hléradr, whose first component means \\"shelter\\" and which could thus be rendered as \\"giver of protection\\".Simek, Rudolf. 1996. Dictionary of Northern Mythology. Translated by Angela Hall. First published: Alfred Kröner Verlag, 1984. Cambridge: D. S. Brewer. . Attestations =Poetic Edda= Læraðr is mentioned in two stanzas of the Grímnismál: :Heidrûn the goat is called, :that stands o’er Odin’s hall, :and bits from Lærâd’s branches. :He a bowl shall fill :with the bright mead; :that drink shall never fail. :Eikthyrnir the hart is called, :that stands o’er Odin’s hall, :and bites from Lærâd’s branches; :from his horns fall :drops into Hvergelmir, :whence all waters rise:-- : ::—Grímnismál (25, 26), Thorpe's translationThorpe, Benjamin (trans.). 1866. Edda Sæmundar Hinns Froða: The Edda Of Sæmund The Learned. London: Trübner & Co. =Prose Edda= Under the name Léraðr, it also appears in Snorri Sturluson's Gylfaginning: :The she-goat, she who is called Heidrún, stands up in Valhall and bites the needles from the limb of that tree which is very famous, and is called [Léraðr]; and from her udders mead runs so copiously, that she fills a tun every day. [...] Even more worthy of note is the hart Eikthyrni, which stands in Valhall and bites from the limbs of the tree; and from his horns distils such abundant exudation that it comes down into Hvergelmir, and from thence fall those rivers called thus [...]. : ::—Gylfaginning (39), Brodeur's translationBrodeur, Arthur Gilchrist (trans.). 1916. Snorri Sturluson: The Prose Edda. New York: The American-Scandinavian Foundation. Theories According to John Lindow, the first reason to identify Lærad with Yggdrasill is \\"Lærad's location at Odin's hall, which would be at the center of the cosmos\\".Lindow, John. 2002. Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs. New York: Oxford University Press. First published: ABC- Clio, 2001. . Another argument is that many animals dwell in or around Yggdrasill, such as an eagle, the squirrel Ratatoskr, four stags, many snakes and the dragon Níðhöggr. Snorri also wrote that Hvergelmir was located under Yggdrasill (Gylfaginning, 15, 16).

The iHeartMedia, Inc. outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 1400 kHz with a power of 1,000 watts. The station goes by the name Fox Sports Radio 1400. Its studios are in Columbia (west of the Congaree River) and the transmitter is east of downtown Columbia. The station was an affiliate of the Atlanta Braves radio network, the largest radio affiliate network in Major League Baseball, but that designation has shifted to AM 560 when the sports programming shifted from WCOS to WXBT. History WCOS signed on in 1939, making it Columbia's second radio station. The station featured programming from NBC's Blue Network (which later became the ABC Radio Network) as well as local programming. In 1958, the station stunted by playing Sammy Kaye's \\"I Wish I Was In Dixie\\" over a period of 24 hours before switching over to the \\"Top 60 in Dixie\\" playlist, a format that it kept for the next 20 years under various monikers like \\"Super COS\\", and \\"Position 14\\". In 1980, after being beaten in the ratings by rival FM Top 40 WNOK, WCOS changed over to Country, simulcasting parts of the broadcasting day of their sister FM, WCOS-FM. In the early 1990s, the station adjusted its format to satellite-fed Classic Country, but went back to simulcasting WCOS-FM within a year's time. In 1995, WCOS switched to CNN Headline News. In 1996, WCOS adopted its present Sports talk format. In 2007, WCOS re-branded itself as \\"The Team\\". On January 3, 2012, as part of a three-way swap, WVOC's news/talk format moved to WXBT-FM, which changed its calls to WVOC-FM. WVOC then changed its calls to WXBT (AM), which took WCOS' sports talk programming. WCOS became \\"Hallelujah 1400\\", an Urban Gospel station. On November 6, 2014, WCOS switched back to sports while WXBT returned to news/talk as WVOC, and WVOC-FM returned to urban contemporary as WXBT.WVOC Columbia Returns to 560; Sports Moves to 1400 The station is owned by Clear Channel Communications, which owns Country WCOS-FM, CHR WNOK, Variety Hits WLTY, Urban contemporary WXBT and News/Talk WVOC in the Columbia radio market.

Johnson (born February 22, 1907) was a New York burglar who was listed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted during 1953. He was a professional boxer. While still a teenager, Johnson was first arrested for burglary in 1921. He continued committing burglary and armed robbery throughout the 1920s until his eventual arrest in 1934 after a robbery in New York. Sentenced to serve four to eight years imprisonment, he was transferred to Dannemora Prison after he shot a police officer during a failed jailbreak from Sing Sing Prison. Although released briefly for six months, he remained imprisoned from 1935 until 1952. Within a year, however, Johnson was on the run from New York authorities after violating his parole for the third time. On August 28, he and four others robbed a bank robber of $5,000 from a previous bank robbery in Lakesville, North Carolina committed four months earlier. Following the bank robber's arrest, he implicated Johnson and the others and, as a result of federal statutes, made their robbery a federal offense with Johnson officially placed on the Ten Most Wanted List on November 12, 1953. Federal agents managed to track Johnson down six weeks later when a local resident of Central Islip, New York recognized Johnson from his photo in a recent magazine article. With local police officers, his ranch-style home was raided at around midnight on December 28, 1953.

He is best known for being a wicked usurer according to Dante in the Divine Comedy. Place in Dante's Inferno In Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy poem Inferno, Dante says that he saw Vitaliano in the inner ring of the Seventh Circle of Hell, where the violent are eternally punished. The inner ring of the Seventh Circle is a burning hot desert with a continual rain of fire. The usurers are to be found sitting on the sand, swatting away fire the way that animals swat bugs, and crying. Vitaliano is the only usurious sinner to be named. However, around the necks of the other usurious sinners are found purses emblazoned with their family coat of arms. This, and a bit of research into Dante's time-period, make it possible to identify who the suffering sinners are meant to be. Usurers are considered violent because, as Dante's Virgil explains in Canto XI, usurers sin against Art, and Art is the Grandchild of God. Relevant lines from The Inferno with explanations (Mandelbaum translation) So I went on alone and even farther (43) along the seventh circle's outer margin, to where the melancholy people sat. Despondency was bursting from their eyes; (46) this side, then that, their hands kept fending off, at times the flames, at times the burning soil: Not otherwise do dogs in summer-now (49) with muzzle, now with paw-when they are bitten by fleas or gnats or by the sharp gadfly. When I had set my eyes upon the faces (52) of some on who the painful fire falls, I recognized no one; but I did notice That from the neck of each a purse was hung (55) that had a special color or an emblem, and their eyes seemed to feast upon these pouches. Looking about-when I had come among them- (58) I saw a yellow purse with azure on it that had the face and manner of a lion. Then, as I let my eyes move further on, (61) I saw another purse that was blood-red, and it displayed a goose more white than butter. And one who had an azure, pregnant sow (64) inscribed as emblem on his white pouch, said io me: \\"What are you doing in this pit? Now be off; and since you're still alive, (67) remember that my neighbor Vitaliano shall yet sit here, upon my left hand side. Among these Florentines, I'm Paduan; (70) I often hear them thunder in my ears, shouting, 'Now let the sovereign cavalier, The one who'll bring the purse with three goats, come!'\\" (73) At this he slewed his mouth, and then he stuck his tongue out, like an ox that licks his nose.

John Horace Ragnar Colvin was the son of Admiral Sir Ragnar Colvin; the grandson of Clement Sneyd Colvin;Australian Dictionary of Biography and the great-grandson of John Russell Colvin, lieutenant- governor of the North-West Provinces of British India during the mutiny of 1857, who had ten children and founded a dynasty of Empire-builders. Relatives included Walter Mytton and Auckland, also lieutenant-governor of the North- West Provinces and Oudh. Brenda Colvin (1897–1981)ONDB was an important landscape architect, author of standard works in the field and a force behind its professionalisation. Sidney Colvin was a critic, curator, and great friend of Robert Louis Stevenson. Colvin married twice. His first marriage was to Anne Manifold in 1948, which ended in 1963. His second was to Moranna Cazenove in 1967. Each marriage produced a son and a daughter.. His former wife Anne later married Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot, a senior officer in the Royal Australian Navy, and became Lady Synnot. One of Colvin's children (with Anne) was Mark Colvin, an Australian journalist.It's not only double agents who lead double lives , Mark Colvin, ABC Online, 5 August 2009 Mark wrote of his father's career in his 2016 book Light and Shadow: Memoirs of a Spy's Son. Career He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and passed into the Royal Navy in the early part of the Second World War. During the War, he served mostly in the Far East. Among other exploits, he joined combined operations in Colombo, and served behind Japanese lines in Vietnam. He emerged from undercover work to accept the surrender of the Japanese command in Saigon on Japan's capitulation, and remained in the South Vietnamese capital for a year. After leaving the Royal Navy with the rank of lieutenant commander, Colvin studied at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London and joined the Secret Intelligence Service. He was posted to a number of Cold War hotspots including Oslo, Vienna and Kuala Lumpur. His most high-profile postings, however, were Consul-General in Hanoi from 1966–67 at the height of the American bombing campaign in the Vietnam War, where he was succeeded by Brian Stewart; HM Ambassador to Outer Mongolia from 1971–74; and head of the SIS station in Washington 1977–1980. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1968 following his return from Hanoi. On retirement from SIS, Colvin advised David Rockefeller for eight years in Hong Kong as a vice-president of the Chase Manhattan Bank. He retired to London in 1988. Colvin wrote military history. His best-selling works were Not Ordinary Men, which examined the Battle of Kohima, and Decisive Battles, which looked at twenty crucial battles throughout history. He also published a memoir of his time in Hanoi and Ulan Bator called Twice Around the World.

Research in Ilmenau is carried out at all stages: theory, application of the theory, prototype testing and transfer to industrial application. Because the TU relies upon interdisciplinary work across faculty boundaries, and brings together many skills thereby, the following highly competitive research activities have been established: * Mobile communications * Nano-engineering * Precision engineering, instrumentation and measurement * Technical and biomedical prosthetic systems * Drive technology, energy and environmental engineering * Digital media technology The university has a major centre contributing greatly to its research performance, the ZMN, Centre for Micro- and Nanotechnology. So that results achieved in applied research can be transferred rapidly to industrial use, and so that spin-off companies are founded by the university and new partners found for collaborative projects, the university has set up public-private partnerships on new models, with the university taking a seat on the management boards of industrial companies. This concept is underlain by the entities known as “TU Ilmenau Service GmbH” and the “Technologiegesellschaft Thüringen mbH & Co. KG”. The university is actively participating in the restructuring and development of the region (“Technologieregion Ilmenau-Arnstadt”). It also contributes to regional planning with its thinking on the encouragement of a high-tech periphery to the campus itself. There is a large number of innovative technological companies which have taken root in the immediate area of the university. With the “Energietechnisches Zentrum Thüringen” (Energy Engineering Centre for Thuringia), the TU Ilmenau is also steering its research strategy into energy engineering. Here the intention is to unite the academic strength of the University in energy engineering and management with the interest of other Thuringian enterprises and institutes.  National and International Networking  The Technische Universität Ilmenau is an active partner in the scientific-technological just as economic promotion of the Ilmenau Technological Development Area. In addition to this, it seeks to gain wide reputation on both a national and international scale. Considering educational export as one its main tasks, the university supports the international exchange of its students and collaborators on the basis of programmes set up for this purpose. The Technische Universität Ilmenau strives to increase the number of foreign students and, therefore, promotes the cultural education as an important aspect of an ever increasing international competence requested. Every two years the Initiative Solidarische Welt Ilmenau e.V. hosts ISWI (International Student Week Ilmenau) at the TU Ilmenau. It is an International Conference for students from all around the world. It aims to foster tolerance, understanding among nations and an international attitude. The TU Ilmenau runs we4you, which is an organization to help and welcome the international students in Ilmenau.  Technische Universität Ilmenau in Thuringian scientific and technological culture  The University is the most important employer in Ilmenau. It is one of the 4 universities in Thuringia, the others being the University of Erfurt, the Bauhaus University of Weimar, and the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena. It is now the most important centre of science in Thuringia, and intensive cooperations with the TU Ilmenau occur.

The festival begins in Havana at the Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabaña, an 18th-century Spanish construction, and spreads east and west of the capital to all provinces and many municipalities. The book fair ends in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba. The fair first took place in 1982, and occurred every two years until 2000 when it became an annual tradition. The festival consists of book vendors, poetry readings, children’s activities, art exhibitions, and concerts in the evenings. It is considered Cuba’s premier cultural event, as well as the event with the highest attendance in Havana. The 18th annual International Book Fair in 2009 had approximately 600,000 visitors. Literacy in Cuba is one of the greatest legacies of the Cuban Revolution of 1959. The law that established the National Press of Cuba was one of the first measures of the revolution. In 1961, Cuba launched a National Literacy Campaign and today, according to the United Nations, Cuba has the highest literacy rate in the world. Along with the public, the book fair is attended by Cuban and international authors, publishers, and political officials that are sanctioned by Cuba's communist government. Over 100 publishing houses present catalogues of books, including Casa de las Américas. Each book fair is dedicated to a genre, issue, or author, and also a guest of honor. Since 2000, each book fair has been dedicated to Cuban authors and intellectuals that are sanctioned by Cuba's government.

He was director of football research-special projects for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) previously in 2016. He was the head coach at the University of Maryland from 2011 to 2015. Edsall was previously the head coach at Uconn from 1999 until the 2011 Fiesta Bowl, and oversaw the program's promotion from the NCAA Division I-AA level to Division I-A. He is UConn's all-time leader in wins and games coached. Coaching career =Early years= A native of Glen Rock, Pennsylvania,Randy Edsall. Nndb.com. Retrieved on November 29, 2011. Edsall is a protege of former New York Giants head coach Tom Coughlin. Edsall played for Coughlin at Syracuse University and later coached under him at Syracuse, at Boston College, and with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Edsall spent the first 14 years of his adult life at Syracuse as a player and coach. He played quarterback for the Orangemen from 1976 to 1979, with Coughlin as his position coach. He then coached at Syracuse under Frank Maloney and Dick MacPherson from 1980 to 1990 and was a part of the 1987 team that went 11–0–1, including a tie in the Sugar Bowl. He then went on to coach at Boston College with Tom Coughlin and was a part of a turnaround at BC. In 1993, they defeated No. 1 ranked Notre Dame in South Bend. He then followed Coughlin to the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Jaguars made it to the AFC Championship Game in their second year as a franchise in 1996 and made the playoffs in 1997. In 1998, he became the defensive coordinator at Georgia Tech and saw his defense improve greatly from the season before, including a co-ACC championship and a Gator Bowl victory over Notre Dame. =University of Connecticut (first stint)= 1999–2003 Edsall was named the 27th head football coach at the University of Connecticut on December 21, 1998 and led the Huskies from Division I-AA into Division I-A. UConn was the first school to ever move from the FCS to the Bowl Championship Series as a member of the Big East. In what has been considered one of the best and fastest building jobs in recent memory, Randy Edsall oversaw a period of unprecedented success at the University of Connecticut. UConn went from Division I-AA into Division I-A, and in only their first year as a full member of the FBS in 2002, Edsall guided the 2002 team to a 6–6 record in its first year with a full Division I-A complement of 85 scholarships. UConn ended the 2002 season impressively with four-straight wins to reach the .500 mark, including season-ending road wins at Navy and at bowl-bound Iowa State of the Big 12 Conference led by Seneca Wallace that was ranked as high as 9th in the country that year, 49–37. The excitement for Edsall and his team continued to swell in 2003 as the Huskies moved into their new home, Rentschler Field, and enjoyed the nation's largest attendance increase with a gain of 21,252 fans per game. Finishing with a 9–3 record, many national media outlets, including Bristol-based ESPN, proclaimed that UConn should have received a bowl berth, a feat highly uncommon for an independent team. Also in 2003, UConn was the only public I-A school to graduate at least 90 percent of its football players. 2004 With their membership in the Big East for the 2004 season, another strong campaign by the Huskies resulted in a bowl berth. UConn went 8–4 against a challenging slate that fall as the program gained its highest ever level of exposure. Behind one of the best players in Connecticut history in Dan Orlovsky, the Huskies capped their historic season with a resounding 39–10 win over Mid-American Conference champion Toledo in the Motor City Bowl. That year saw 2 players get drafted, Dan Orlovsky, and Alfred Fincher. 2005–2006 The 2005–2006 seasons saw a period of transition for the program. After graduating many impactful seniors after the 2004 season, the Huskies finished the 2005 season 5–6. More of the same happened in the 2006 season as the Huskies finished 4–8. 2007 The 2007 season witnessed a new level of excitement in Storrs as the Huskies earned their first ever national rankings, peaking at No. 13 in the BCS standings on November 5. UConn became just the second Big East team to ever go 7–0 at home and defeated three teams there which were ranked in the Top 10 at some point during the season. That year they also beat their first ranked opponent in school history by beating the #11 South Florida Bulls on October 27, 2007, 22–15. The Huskies finished that season at 9–4 with a berth in the Meineke Car Care Bowl, earning Edsall New England Division I Coach of the Year accolades. 2008 The 2008 season was also very successful. After a 5–0 start and a return to the top 25 rankings, the Huskies finished the season at 8–5 and defeated Buffalo in the International Bowl in Toronto, Canada, 38–20. After a record breaking year, Donald Brown became the first first round draft pick in school history. 2009 The 2009 season saw both great success and great tragedy. After defeating the Louisville Cardinals on October 17, 2009, Jasper Howard, a cornerback on the team was stabbed to death the next day outside of a school dance at the UConn Student Union. After this, the Huskies lost 3 games to West Virginia, Rutgers and Cincinnati by a combined 8 points. After a bye week, Edsall's Huskies won their final three regular season games in 2009 – including a historic double-overtime win over Notre Dame on Nov 21 at Notre Dame Stadium, 33–30. In their Bowl game they defeated South Carolina 20–7 in the PapaJohns.com Bowl. UConn posted a 7–5 regular season record facing the 25th-toughest regular season schedule in the country and with their bowl win they finished 8–5. 2010 On September 11, 2010, Edsall became the winningest coach in Connecticut football history with a 62-3 victory over Texas Southern. His 67th victory placed him ahead of the 66 wins compiled by J. Orlean Christian between 1934 and 1949. Edsall led the Huskies to a 33–19 record over his last four seasons there as UConn became the first program ever to go from FBS newcomer to BCS bowl participant in just seven seasons. After a 3–4 start, the Huskies beat West Virginia 13–10 in overtime for their first win over the Mountaineers in program history. UConn won their last five games of the regular season to earn a share of the Big East title, Edsall's second as head coach and UConn's second in four years. By virtue of their overtime win over the Mountaineers, the Huskies represented the Big East in the BCS, the first major bowl appearance in school history. UConn went on to play in the Fiesta Bowl against the University of Oklahoma, losing 48-20. Edsall was named 2010 Big East Coach of the Year. =University of Maryland= 2011–2012 Randy Edsall along the sideline during the Terps' 2013 game vs. the Clemson Tigers. Edsall was hired in 2011 after he led the University of Connecticut to its first appearance in a BCS bowl game. In Edsall's inaugural season, the Terrapins finished with a record of 2–10. In 2012, the Terrapins finished with a 4–8 record. On November 19, 2012, the school announced it was joining the Big Ten Conference and leaving the Atlantic Coast Conference, a conference Maryland cofounded in 1953 with Clemson. The Big Ten is a revenue-sharing conference that, thanks to the success of the Big Ten Network, in recent years, has generated more revenue than any other conference, distributing that money among its members. 2013 Edsall saw steady improvement in his three years as Maryland's coach: going from 2–10 in his first year, to 4–8 in his second. In 2013, his third season as head coach, after defeating West Virginia in one of the program's biggest wins over West Virginia, Edsall led his 4–0 team into the Associated Press top 25 poll, entering at #25. They would fall out of the rankings the following week after a road loss to eventual National Champion, then ranked #8 Florida State. The highlight of the season came in Lane Stadium at Virginia Tech. The Terrapins had multiple starters out due to injury heading into the game. Maryland stunned Virginia Tech and all but ending their ACC Championship hopes by beating them in overtime, 27–24. The victory also made the Terrapins bowl eligible. It was the first time since 1949 that the Terrapins won in Lane Stadium and the first time since 1990 that Maryland had beaten Virginia Tech. The Terrapins finished the regular season 7–5, earning bowl eligibility for the first time under Edsall, a steady improvement from the previous 4–8 season. In the Terrapins final game of the regular season, the team ended on a high note: winning their last conference game as a member of the ACC, 41–21 on the road against NC State. After a successful season in what would be their last in the ACC, the Terrapins were invited to the Military Bowl in Annapolis, Maryland. 2014 In 2014, Edsall guided the Terrapins to a third-place finish in the Big Ten East. Finishing behind Michigan State and the eventual National Champions, the Ohio State Buckeyes. After a 3–1 start, the Terrapins won their inaugural Big Ten game with a victory at Indiana 37–15. They then went on to win their first game at home in the Big Ten, defeating the Iowa Hawkeyes 38–31. The Terrapins biggest win of the season and one of the biggest wins in program history came on November 1, 2014. The Terrapins traveled to State College, Pennsylvania to play the Penn State Nittany Lions. Previously, Penn State had dominated the series and the rivalry with a record of 35–1–1 against Maryland and the Terrapins had never won in Beaver Stadium. Maryland's lone win came at Byrd Stadium in 1961. Brad Craddock, the eventual Lou Groza Award winner, kicked a 43-yard field goal with 51 seconds left to give the Terrapins their first win at Beaver Stadium and their first win over the Nittany Lions since 1961. Trying to build this old regional rivalry back up, in a post-game interview Randy Edsall said \\"let the rivalry begin\\". A few weeks later saw another milestone for the Maryland Football program. Maryland had never beaten Michigan in football in 3 prior meetings with the Wolverines. On November 22, 2014, the Terrapins ended that streak by beating Michigan in the Big House 23–16, which assured the Terrapins of back-to-back winning seasons for just the third time in the past 30 years. The Terrapins finished their inaugural Big Ten season 7–5 (4–4) with a third-place finish in the East division. They posted the conference's best road record at 5–1. The Terrapins also made it to back-to-back bowl games as they were invited to the Foster Farms Bowl in Santa Clara, California. It was also announced that the program had its highest APR scores in program history since the APR's inception (973 multi year, 991 single year). This came after losing scholarships upon his arrival because of bad APR scores from the seasons before he arrived in College Park. 2015 On June 30, 2015, it was announced that the University of Maryland and Edsall had agreed upon a 3-year extension through 2019 worth 7.5 million dollars. On October 11, 2015, Edsall was relieved of his duties with offensive coordinator Mike Locksley named as the interim head coach for the rest of the 2015 season. =Detroit Lions=  2016  On January 31, 2016, Edsall was named director of football research-special projects for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). Lions general manager Bob Quinn was a graduate assistant in the Connecticut athletic department when Edsall was the head coach for the Huskies in 1999. =University of Connecticut (second stint)=  2017  After a year of being away from college football, Edsall would return to Connecticut where he had previously been the head coach for 12 years. During his first month back, Edsall created a media backlash by withdrawing a scholarship from linebacker Ryan Dickens, two weeks before signing day, who had verbally committed to Connecticut under fired head coach Bob Diaco. Dickens later ended up at Lafayette, a lower level FCS school, adding to more questions regarding some of Diaco's recruiting and the need for change that brought back Edsall. 2018 In 2018 Edsall was involved in a political scandal over nepotism in the Uconn Huskies football program and favoritism in the State General Assembly. The Hartford Courant reported that Public Act 18-175, a bill about State management of online data, included a one paragraph amendment to the end of the 11-page bill that read, “A state employee who is employed at a constituent unit of the state system of higher education and a member of the immediate family of such state employee may be employed in the same department or division of such constituent unit.” It was alleged that this legislation had been introduced on behalf of Edsall so that he could employ his own son, Corey Edsall, against the recommendations of the State Ethics Committee. The plan was reportedly hatched during the Carmen Cozza all-state high school football banquet at the Aqua Turf Club in Southington. Joe Aresimowicz introduced the legislation that created a loophole for Edsall’s son after Edsall spoke to him about the matter. Aresimowicz didn’t deny that this was the motivation behind the legislation commented that “As a head coach for over 20 years I’ve talked to other coaches who say Corey is a first class coach and knows what he is doing,” he told the Hartford Courant. “I believe that UConn has the checks and balances in place to ensure that no one is taking advantage of this situation.” In 2017 Uconn and Edsall had appealed the CT State Ethics Board ruling saying they violated the state’s nepotism laws by hiring his son as an assistant coach. After the change in legislation the appeal continued on its own merits. In November of 2018, A Superior Court judge ruled that UConn did not violate state ethics codes when it hired Corey Edsall to be a coach on his father’s football staff. In a 41-page ruling, Judge Joseph Shortall said the state ethics board “abused its discretion” and was “clearly erroneous” in its key ruling in the case. Personal life Edsall has two children, a son Corey Edsall who is now a coach at UConn after spending 2 years on the staff of Colorado, and a daughter, with his wife. He is a graduate of Syracuse University, where he played as a quarterback. His brother, Duke, is an NCAA basketball official. Shortly after being fired by University of Maryland, he put his home in Fulton, Maryland up for sale for $975,000. He had purchased the home for $829,000 in 2011 and the home sold for $950,000 in 2016.

History =Early history= Wilmington Savings Fund Society was chartered as a Delaware thrift in 1832 by a group of Wilmington community leaders and businessmen. The bank was formed for the working citizens of Wilmington to encourage thrift, to safeguard and increase their savings in a community bank. The bank's first day of business was February 18, 1832, in a rented room \\"one door below\\" Town Hall on Market Street. The bank grew steadily through the 19th century, and moved locations twice more before constructing their own building at 838 N. Market Street in 1895. The building stood until 1929, when the current building was constructed and opened for business. Three years later the building would receive its landmark mural, Apotheosis of the Family by N. C. Wyeth. The mural, 60'x19', was commissioned by Frederick Stone to celebrate the bank's 100th anniversary, and a smaller version of this mural still hangs in the bank's current headquarters at 500 Delaware Avenue in Wilmington. WSFS Bank Center at 500 Delaware Avenue, Wilmington, DE =1950s to early 1990s= WSFS' growth continued in the 1950s and 60s, and was the first bank in the United States to issue debit cards in the late 1960s. By the 1980s, WSFS had expanded from northern New Castle County into Kent and Sussex counties, and went public in 1986 on the NASDAQ market. By the early 1990s the bank was in poor financial shape, and was near bankruptcy. The Board of Directors hired Marvin \\"Skip\\" Schoenhals in 1990, and began a dramatic turnaround. Nearly all of the lower Delaware branches were sold to Wilmington Trust, and lending practices and credit quality were administered more closely. =Mid-1990s to 2007= Over time, the bank gradually strengthened and was reintroduced to Kent County and Sussex County. In 1995, WSFS Bank opened its first branch in Kent County since the 1991 closings in the Dover Metro Supermarket. The first new branch in Sussex County since the closings opened in Rehoboth Beach in July 2003 and moved to its current location in June 2004. New branch locations have since opened in Camden, Canterbury, Harrington, Lewes, Long Neck, Milford, Millsboro, Ocean View, Seaford, Selbyville, Smyrna, West Dover and Wyoming.

The term may also be used in other countries worldwide but it originated within the United States Armed Forces. This system is designed to allow a single commander to exercise command and control of all military forces in the AOR, regardless of their branch of service. The President of the United States signed the U.S. Unified Command Plan (UCP) 2008 on 17 December 2008, establishing the up-to-date boundaries for the newest Command, United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM), and all changes to boundaries of the other Commands.DefenseLINK-Unified Command Plan, \\"The World with Commanders' Area of Responsibility\\" .

Boundaries were adjusted in the high northern latitudes between USEUCOM, USNORTHCOM and USPACOM. http://www.defense.gov/news/UCP_2011_Map4.pdf Combatant commanders may designate theaters of war, theaters of operation, combat zones, and communications zones. Joint force commanders may define additional operational areas or joint areas to assist in the coordination and execution of joint warfare. The size of these areas and the types of forces used depend on the scope, nature, and projected duration of the operation.U.S. Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication (MCDP) 1-0, Marine Corps Operations, (SecNavy: 2001) Dist.#: 142 000014 00 \\\\---- Combatant commanders and other joint force commanders use the following organization of the battlespace at the operational level of war. Combatant commanders are assigned an area of responsibility in the Unified Command Plan. *Theater of war, the area of aerial, terrestrial, and naval/littoral that is, or may become, directly involved in the manner of combat; either defined by the National Command Authority or a combatant commander, This area doesn't normally encompass the combatant commander's entire area of responsibility. *Theater of operations, a sub-area within a theater of war defined by the force commander required to conduct or support specific operations. Different theaters of operations within the same theater of war will normally be geographically separate and focused on different enemy forces. Theaters of operations are usually of significant size, allowing for operations over extended periods of time. *Combat zone, areas required by combat forces for the conduct of operations. *Communication zone, the rear part of the theater of war or theater of operations (behind but contiguous to the combat zone) that contains lines of communications, establishments for supply or evacuation, and other agencies required for the immediate support and maintenance of the field forces. The Marine Corps component commander will normally focus efforts to deploy, support, and sustain forces, particularly the MAGTF, in the communications zone The commander will normally locate headquarters close to the joint force commander, who usually establishes headquarters in the communications zone. Understanding the joint battlespace at the operational level of war in which forces will operate is an important step in setting the conditions for their success. Force commanders must understand the relationship between the Area of Operation (AO), Area of Interest, and Area of Influence. By analyzing AO in terms of area of influence and area of interest, a force commander determines whether the assigned AO is appropriate. This analysis may include the forces’ capabilities to conduct actions across the warfighting functions. Area of operation A diagram of the battlespace; contiguous is shown with relation to noncontiguous areas of responsibilities. The Areas of Operation, or AOs, are areas that component and force commanders define as their tactical operability. It is also known as close battlespace. The commanders focus on establishing command and control in this area; which encompasses all aspects of fire support—naval gunfire, air and artillery superiority—in order to provide his ground forces the support they need. Also, the commander sets up force protection and supportive arms, such as logistics or reinforcements. :The term \\"area of operations\\" has long been used in the U.S. Army, for the geographic areas of interest to much smaller units than the combatant commands. It has especially been used among U.S. Army Special Forces. The commander can choose to organize his AO so that his subordinates have contiguous or noncontiguous AOs: *Contiguous AO—In a contiguous AO, all the subordinate commands' share one or more common boundary within supporting distance of one another in the battlespace. A commander may establish their battlespace in a reflection of linear operations, where there is a continuity and contiguous array of units across the area of operation (AO). *Noncontiguous—A noncontiguous Area of Operation is one where one or more subordinate AOs do not share a common boundary. The commander establishes noncontiguous AOs when a more likely situation is one where the task force conducts non-linear operations within a noncontiguous battlespace and within an operational framework with noncontiguous deep, close, and rear areas. Operation Restore Hope in Somalia during 1992–1993, is an example of a battlefield framework with noncontiguous areas. The United States' Marine Air- Ground Task Forces' (MAGTF) rear area was centered around the separate sites of the embassy compound, port, and airfield in the city of Mogadishu, while its close area was widely scattered around the towns and villages of the interior that were occupied by the MAGTF. The MAGTF's deep area included the rest of the country and particularly those population and relief centers not under the joint force commander's supervision. Areas of influence In an area of influence, the component or force commander assigns subordinate units to conduct missions in and out of this area. Communication is key, either for reconnaissance to report intelligence or fire support for ground forces. Sometimes known as distant battlespace, it is useful to the force commander as a tool in assigning subordinate areas of operations and in focusing intelligence collection and information operations to shape the battlespace to facilitate future operations. Today's area of influence may be tomorrow's AO. Area of interest The key term area of interest specifies areas of interest to the component or force commander; the location of friendly and enemy forces, and the capabilities that may be an advantage, the infrastructure, and key terrain that concern the commander. The size of the area of interest normally exceeds the commander's operational reach, which mainly focuses within the scope of deep operations. While the area of interest includes the AO and area of influence, the area of interest may stretch far beyond the other parts of a commander's battlespace. A commander may also have areas of interest around airbases in other countries neighboring the task force's AO.

The event is known for its tableaux vivants or \\"living pictures\\" in which classical and contemporary works of art are recreated by real people who are made to look nearly identical to the originals through the clever application of costumes, makeup, headdresses, lighting, props, and backdrops. The first Festival of Arts was produced in 1932, and the first presentation of the Pageant was done in 1933. Since then, the two events have been held each summer, apart from a four-year interruption caused by World War II. History Entrance to the Pageant of the Masters and Festival of Arts Fine Art Show In 1933, at the second Festival of Arts, artist Lolita Perine had an idea for a living work of art. Persuading residents of Laguna Beach to dress in costume, she seated them behind an oversized frame, recreating well-known works of art. The \\"Spirit of the Masters Pageant\\" was formally started the next year by the Festival's organizers and was put on again in 1934, but in those early days was an amateur operation of low quality.Dan Duling, 2008 Pageant of the Masters: All the World's A Stage, Official Souvenir Program (Laguna Beach: Festival of the Arts, 2008), p. 64. In 1934, local developer Roy Ropp expressed his dissatisfaction with the poor quality of the production in blunt terms; the Festival's board responded to his frank criticism by placing him in charge of the Pageant. He renamed it the \\"Pageant of the Masters\\" and with the assistance of his wife, Marie, he organized a high-quality and well-received production in the summer of 1935.Duling (2008), pp. 64-65. Building upon this initial success, the Ropps continued to refine and improve the Pageant through its 1941 production; then the Festival and Pageant were suspended for four years due to World War II.Duling (2008), pp. 65-66. Because of increasing personal friction between the Ropps and the Festival's board, Roy Ropp came back only once after the war to direct the Pageant, in 1950. Ropp died in 1974, but today is still remembered as the \\"Father of the Pageant.\\"Duling (2008), p. 66. The Pageant was cancelled in 2020 due to Covid-19.http://www.foapom.com/covid19/ Pageant The Pageant is held eight weeks each summer and consists of 90 minutes of \\"living pictures\\" accompanied by a professional narrator, an orchestra, and period songs by professional vocalists. It hosts more than a quarter million people each year. The Pageant is put on by a small paid staff and several hundred volunteers. Production begins in January with auditions and casting of volunteers from all over Southern California; it takes over 60,000 volunteer hours to put on the two-month Pageant in July and August. Today, the costumes and makeup involved are very elaborate and often require large commitments of volunteer time, so to reduce the impact on individual volunteers, the Pageant selects two full casts known as Blue and Green, which then alternate back and forth. In popular culture The Pageant of the Masters was parodied in the Arrested Development episode \\"In God We Trust\\".

Style Cutrone's paintings are colorful, lively, and less challenging than those of his contemporaries. As Andy Warhol's assistant at the Factory atop the Decker Building from 1972 until 1980, Cutrone worked with Warhol on paintings, prints, films, and other concepts, eventually co-opting Warhol's earliest work (pre-1960) as well as works by Roy Lichtenstein and others, until finally distilling those myriad influences into the style a few critics eventually labeled \\"Post-Pop.\\" He exhibited at the Niveau Gallery in 1979 with a Scottish artist called Mike Gall who showed paintings of Snoopy, Mickey and Minnie mouse, the Pink Panther and also a small series of Peter Rabbit paintings. In this exhibition no evidence of the style the critics would call \\"Post-Pop\\" could be seen in Cutrone's work. Victor Hugo was the other artist who was featured in this three man group show which was called \\"Three New New York Artists\\". In 1980, Cutrone's place was taken by Jay Shriver so that Cutrone could concentrate on his own painting. He achieved international acclaim with his very first post-Warhol show. At the same time Mike Gall died in a car crash in Scotland following the death of his father. Together with Kenny Scharf, Cutrone revived the comic strip in painting. By using established comic characters such as Woody Woodpecker and Felix the Cat, Cutrone rephrased themes of originality and authorship, and of low-brow taste and fine art which makes him directly indebted to Pop Art of early Sixties. His use of bright and fluorescent colours encouraged Andy Warhol’s return to such hues of heightened artificiality. \\"Everything is a cartoon for me,\\" Ronnie Cutrone says. \\"The ancient manuscripts are taken very seriously but they really are cartoons.\\" Ronnie died in 2013 at his home in Lake Peekskill, NY. Collections Cutrone's works have been exhibited at: Whitney Museum (New York), Museum of Modern Art (New York), Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (Rotterdam), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and fine art galleries internationally.\\"Tataboo\\", Exhibition Catalogue Lorenzelli Arte Milano, 2003 Personal Cutrone was married four times.

He was highly esteemed in the Florence of his day as “the sovereign cavalier\\", and was chosen for many high offices. On the negative side, he was a gambler who lost great sums at play. Additionally, he is known for being a wicked usurer according to Dante in the Divine Comedy. He was a member of the Becchi family, which means “goats” in Italian. Place in Dante's Inferno In Dante’s Divine Comedy poem Inferno, Dante says that he saw Giovanni in the inner ring of the Seventh Circle of Hell, where the violent are eternally punished. The inner ring of the Seventh Circle is a burning hot desert with a continual rain of fire. The usurers are to be found sitting on the sand, swatting away fire the way that animals swat bugs, and crying. Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani, along with Giovanni, are the only usurious sinners to be referred to by name. However, around the necks of the other usurious sinners are found purses emblazoned with their family coat of arms. This, and a bit of research into Dante's time-period, make it possible to identify who the suffering sinners are meant to be. Usurers are considered violent because, as Dante's Virgil explains in Canto XI, usurers sin against Art, and Art is the Grandchild of God.

ABC rebroadcast the episode September 1, 1966 and May 18, 1967. Plot synopsis Picking up from the last episode, Bruce Wayne's burning feet revive him just in time, and he retrieves from his pocket his cigarette lighter containing a lifetime supply of butane gas, and throws it into the fire. A sudden blast ensues, eating up the oxygen, putting the furnace out, and throwing Bruce free from the net, far enough to make his escape. Later, at the Batcave, as the Penguin and his \\"Finks\\" cleverly eavesdrop courtesy of a bug he planted on The Batbrella, Batman and Robin decide that the Penguin's scheme is kidnapping actress Dawn Robbins, who is in town at a penthouse apartment. Batman then discusses the whole scheme the Penguin must have, which the listening Penguin plans to carry out with an added detail of his own. Batman and Robin go to Dawn (who is bored from the life of a movie star and wants to experience something exciting). They notify her that they believe she is in danger, and she agrees to let them stay and stake-out the place. The Penguin, Hawkeye and Sparrow swing across to Robbins' terrace on giant umbrellas; Penguin enters through the screen door and he gasses Dawn to sleep. As Batman and Robin try to stop the Penguin, a powerful magnet the Penguin had positioned just outside is turned on and they are pulled to it because of the metal in their utility belts, immobilizing them. It is later revealed that Batman and Robin had escaped from the magnet by a room service waiter and return to police headquarters. Knowing Penguin is listening in through the umbrella's bug, they announce that the ransom will be paid at Wayne Manor and that Batman and Robin will be waiting inside the armor statues immediately inside in the entrance hall. The Penguin goes to Wayne Manor and returns the actress. He then uses his gas-umbrella to knock out anyone inside the statues. He returns to his hideout to find out that Batman and Robin were waiting there; there had been dummies inside the statues all along. The Penguin is apprehended.

Career Melby's first publication was Matmania which he started aged 15 in his home state of Minnesota, and later joined Kietzer Publishing as an editor of numerous wrestling magazines including The Wrestling News, Wrestling Revue, Wrestling Monthly and The Ring's Wrestling Magazine. He was also co- editor with Norman Kietzer of Major League Wrestling Programs, which was produced for nearly every major promotion including the American Wrestling Association, World Wrestling Federation, National Wrestling Alliance, World Wrestling Association, Mid-South Wrestling, Southwest Championship Wrestling and numerous independent promotions. He would also edit the Pro Wrestling Report publication of AWA founder Verne Gagne. Melby also published wrestling profiles under a Wrestling Facts banner, which were career retrospective booklets featuring many early stars such as Gagne, Bronko Nagurski, Red Bastien, Dr. Bill Miller, Whipper Billy Watson, Rikidozan and numerous others. Aside from periodicals, Melby also wrote two books. First was Mat Wars! in 1985, written with Gagne, profiling the AWA's roster and stars of the period. His second was Gopherland Grappling: The Early Years, a pictorial book showcasing Minnesota wrestling history, came twenty-one years later in 2006, and featured photographs he had taken over the years. The book was planned as the first of two due to the amount of material Melby has amassed. Melby's later work included contributing to the newsletters of the Cauliflower Alley Club, of which he was Photographical Librarian, and continued to write for Wrestling Revue. Outside of wrestling, he also published articles about music and architecture. In 2006 the Iowa-based George Tragos/Lou Thesz Hall of Fame honored Melby with an award in his name. Melby was at the ceremony and was unaware of an award honoring wrestling historians, or that he would not only receive the inaugural awarding but that it would be called the James C. Melby Award. Personal life His personal life included a battle with diabetes since 1971, which resulted in a kidney transplant and the amputation of both legs. Melby was married twice, both ending in divorce. Melby was found dead beside his bed on February 11, 2007, and is survived by his mother June, daughter Michelle and son-in-law Chad.

The game features a campaign mode, six different scenarios of varying difficulty, and a multiplayer option. It later inspired a book of the same name in the Tom Clancy's Power Plays series.  Overview  This is a game of economic intrigue and corporate maneuvering. As the new CEO of a software company, players must scheme and strategize, form and break alliances, undertake sometimes criminal actions and do whatever it takes to get the company to the top and keep it there. Playing in a board- game-like environment, players can choose to play any of six individual scenarios or a full campaign. The scenarios each have fundamentally different parameters. Players at an advanced point in the action with opposing corporations already established and a small history already in place. The campaign is more freeform and the player with only one building and three departments with no immediate opponents. While objectives vary for the scenarios, in the campaign game the player must control seventy-five percent of the market for four turns. Setting up a game involves determining how long is it going to last—between 20, 40 or 60 turns. You also choose the level of AI you wish to play against, novice, intermediate or expert. Lastly, players can set their own difficulty level that indicates how far they can go into debt before losing (bankruptcy). On the easy setting, players can incur debt up to $10,000, medium $5,000 and hardest $2,500. Other selections include naming the corporation and selecting a CEO. Each CEO has a unique benefit that he or she brings with labels like \\"Talented,\\" \\"Whiz Kid\\" or \\"Banker.\\" These benefits add, as examples, five percent per level to all computer points generated (Whiz Kid) or let you go twice as deep in debt before becoming bankrupt and losing the game (Banker). Gameplay in Tom Clancy's ruthless.com is turn-based. Each turn, you gives CEO two orders, choosing from the Corporate, R&D;, Marketing, Admin, Human Resources, Acquisitions, Legal, Security and Computer groups. Each group contains action orders such as \\"build new department\\" and \\"build new product\\" in the Corporate group, \\"executive training\\" in the Admin group and \\"assassinate executive\\" in the Security group. At the end of each round, players get a comparative report that informs them on any newsworthy events such as how well (or how poorly) each company's stock prices are doing and any tragedies or executive promotions. As chosen executive(s) (you can hire more as the game progresses) gain experience, they're considered higher-level and sometimes gain additional traits (bonuses like the ones they start out with—as a Banker, Whiz Kid and so on). Each round players attempt to acquire a larger portion of the market (represented by tiles on the game board). Doing this involves carrying out executive orders and negotiating to acquire the start-up companies that occasionally pop up around the game board.Game synopsis by Gil Shif at Allgame.com  Gameplay  The game takes place on a map that represents the market share of all the competing companies. Each player in the game is a CEO of a software company. Legal, security, and computer attacks are common in the game. Competition comes from the fight over market shares (map squares). A CEO builds their initial buildings and puts their product into the market. Once on the market a product's quality will determine its dominance in the market. Dominance in the market provides income to build additional buildings, bid for takeovers, or launch different kinds of attacks against the competitors.  Reception  GameSpot reviewed the game in 1999, awarding 6.3 out of 10. Main criticisms included the shortness of the campaign, limited scenarios and lack of replayability. However, the multiplayer mode was deemed \\"about as much fun as turn-based multiplayer games can be\\". The graphics were also highlighted, with a well designed interface and inventive visuals.Review at Gamespot In Game Revolution, the game was awarded a B+. The gameplay, multiplayer mode and interface were praised, while the main criticisms included the start difficult and the \\"poorly explained manual\\".Review at Gamerevolution = Reviews = * PC Gameworld - 85/100 * Game Revolution - B+ * GameGenie - 80/100 * MoybGames - 64/100 * GameSpot - 6.3/10 * Gamepower - 2,5/4 * Allgame.com - 3/5 * Gamecenter - 3/5 * IGN - 5.2/10 * Gamespot UK (Pre-2003) - 4/10Mobyranks References External links *Tom Clancy's ruthless.com at MobyGames Category:1998 video games Category:Business simulation games Category:Tom Clancy games Category:Tom Clancy's Power Plays Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Tom Clancy's ruthless.com"},{"id":"9452667","text":"Oregon Route 282 is a state highway running from OR 281 north of Odell to OR 35 east of Odell within the U.S. state of Oregon.

Despite their common name, flame scallops are not closely related to true scallops. This species is found in the Caribbean Sea. It is similar in appearance to the Indo-Pacific electric flame scallop (Ctenoides ales).  Description  Flame scallops have a rough shell and a red mantle. At the edge of the mantle are red and white tentacles. The flame scallop's vibrant red color is due to the large amount of carotenoids found within their body. Flame scallops can reach 3 inches in length. As is the case in almost all bivalves, the gills in this species are used both for respiration and filtration.  Habitat and diet  Flame scallops rest in their own \\"nests\\", which are made of small coral pieces and rocks. Flame scallops are herbivorous, eating only phytoplankton. During the consumption process, flame scallops sift and sort through the phytoplankton with their palps to determine what is appropriate for ingestion.  Predators  To escape predators such as crabs and shrimp, the flame scallop’s valves are utilized in fast locomotion, clapping their valves together to propel themselves away.

Education Eric Grate studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in Stockholm between 1917 and 1920. Thereafter he undertook study trips to Germany, especially to Munich, and to Italy and Greece. He moved to Paris in 1924 and stayed there for ten years. In France he lived in the companionship of a number of other Swedish artists, including Nils Dardel, Isaac Grünewald, Sigrid Hjertén, Otto G. Carlsund and Otte Sköld. Between 1941 and 1951 he was a professor at the [Swedish] Royal Academy of Arts. Grate has been commissioned for at great number of public works of art in Sweden. The most famous of its time was The Etymological Woman Theft which was erected outside the premises of Karolinska Institutet in Solna, a suburb of Stockholm, towards the end of the 1950s. This heralded the start of one of the fiercest public debates about the arts in Sweden during the 20th century. The majority of the faculty of the Institute protested against the sculpture as indecent and against the ethics of medicine. The controversy was not resolved until a decision by the Swedish Superior Court of Administrative Matters was taken in favour of the sculpture.

The work was inspired in part by the death from polio of his son Michael in 1935. Howells wrote the work from 1936 to 1938, drawing on material from the then-unpublished Requiem of 1932,Until the publication of Palmer's researches, the Requiem was believed to have been composed in 1936. but then retained the music privately, without public performance. Howells maintained later in life that Ralph Vaughan Williams convinced him to allow the work to be performed publicly at the Three Choirs Festival. However, his former pupil and biographer Paul Spicer contends that Howells first showed the music to Herbert Sumsion, organist of Gloucester Cathedral, who in turn showed it to Gerald Finzi, and that only after these two expressed their enthusiasm did Howells show the music to Vaughan Williams. The title 'Hymnus Paradisi' was suggested by Sumsion. The work received its successful premiere at the Festival in 1950.Wilfrid Mellers, \\"CD Reviews: Herbert Howells\\" (July 1995). The Musical Times, 136 (1829): pp. 384-385. The score was published in 1951. At one time the work was to include a setting of the \\"Hymnus circa exsequias defuncti\\" of Prudentius, later set in English as Take him, earth, for cherishing.. The opening line, in Latin, instead appears as an epigraph to the published score. The piece consists of six movements: #Preludio (for orchestra) #Requiem aeternam #The Lord is my shepherd (a setting of Psalm 23) #Sanctus. I will lift up mine eyes (which juxtaposes the Sanctus from the Ordinary of the Mass with Psalm 121) #I heard a voice from heaven (from the Burial Service) #Holy is the true light (from the Salisbury Diurnal, translation by G.

It was first telecast as the fifth episode on ABC January 26, 1966 and was rerun May 25, 1966 and May 24, 1967. Plot synopsis The story begins with the Joker in prison pitching in (and enjoying) a ballgame. After a few pitches, the catcher switches the ball with one he has stashed in his padding, and tells the Joker \\"This is the one.\\" As the batter hits the ball, a smoke cloud appears and before anyone had known what happened, the Joker magically escaped using a spring-loaded device that propelled him over the prison wall. The only thing the Joker left behind was a statue of his face and bust that was concealed under the spring contraption. Batman and Robin go to the museum to check everything out—they were suspicious the Joker would strike there in revenge because he had not been entered into The Comedy Hall of Fame. When arriving, they found out the Joker's statue was indeed there and decided he must be somewhere else. After everything's locked up, they realize that no one can break in, but that doesn't mean someone who isn't already in the building couldn't break out, which means the Joker's gang is likely already inside to begin with. Reentering the museum, they find the Joker trying to steal the valuable jewels inside, with henchmen named after comedy stars, who were hidden inside the busts. While the fight ensues, Batman is knocked unconscious from a falling antique sword that had been hanging on the wall. As they are carrying Robin and him away, he uses a gas pellet from his utility belt. The Joker escapes out a trap door while his henchmen are gathered up. After being defeated once again by Batman's utility belt, a fed-up Joker decides to make his own. While in his hideout, the Joker comes up with an idea to steal the S.S. Gotham (from his henchwoman). He plans to eliminate Batman so he can take the ship. Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson arrive at the commissioners office for talk on the S.S. Gotham. While there, a clown doll is thrown through the window. Bruce Wayne asks to take it for a souvenir and back at the Batcave Batman and Robin try to figure out what the Joker is up to. They come up with the idea that the Joker will be at The Gotham City Opera Company, where Pagliacci is being performed. While at the opera, Batman and Robin are caught when the Joker throws sneezing powder in their face and his henchmen grab our heroes. A horrified audience then watches the Joker make a move to unmask Batman and Robin... Cliffhanger Text COULD THIS MEAN CURTAINS??

SAME TIME, SAME CHANNEL! (This is the first episode that has the narrator read the line “Answers tomorrow! Same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!”) Notes * This episode is based on \\"The Joker's Utility Belt,\\" a 1952 comic story published in Batman #73. * The Joker's henchwoman Queenie originated in the comic books in the 1940s. In that story, as the Joker's cohort, she learned Bruce Wayne was Batman but was killed, taking the information with her. * Writer Robert Dozier is the son of Batman Executive Producer William Dozier. * As Chief of Police, O'Hara should know better than to give away evidence as souvenirs, even if he didn't like the look of it. * Both Jose Ferrer and Gig Young were considered for the role of the Joker. After Romero was cast, Frank Sinatra expressed interest in playing the role. * Cesar Romero refused to shave his mustache which gave him his career, so they had to cover it with makeup as well. * The aliases of The Joker's Henchmen are named after legendary (and deceased) comedians: Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, W.C. Fields, and Ernie Kovacs. * During the fight scene near the middle of this episode, the usual fight scene music does NOT play as it usually does. * Some scenes have Batman's bat emblem high on his chest, like in the comics. Usually, on the TV show, the emblem is more in the middle of his torso. * The mask worn by Heath Ledger's Joker in the opening scene of The Dark Knight is almost identical to the one worn by the Joker during his performance in Pagliacci. It can be seen as a reference to the 60s TV-show. * The Joker appears hugely excited about unmasking Batman in the theatre scene, and yet shows no subsequent interest in unmasking the duo during the whole series.Batman at 45: A Milestone Tribute to Pow, Bam and Zap!

Rosary's brother school is Servite High School and its sister school is Cornelia Connelly High School. Rosary offers a needs-based scholarship program as well as scholarships in various areas to incoming freshman students. History The school was opened as Rosary High School in 1965 by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and was originally administered by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange. In 1976 it came under the direction of the Diocese of Orange upon its creation. The school began significant reorganization starting the 2014-15 school year, including a new organizational structure, new curricular and marketing programs, and the renaming of the institution as Rosary Academy the following year. Red and Gold One of Rosary Academy's most novel traditions is that of \\"Red and Gold\\", an annual school-wide, student-run musical competition. From January to March, the students are divided into two teams (the Red and Gold teams) which each have student captains in the categories of script, drama, choral, dance, drill, props, publicity, media, fashion, historian, house manager, and stage tech, as well as two overall producers. A neutral (\\"White\\") team also participates, made up of ASB members as well as representatives from the junior and senior classes. The White team helps to facilitate the logistical portion of the production and announces the winner at the end of the last performance. The goal of the annual Red and Gold competition is to feature the talents of students and also to instill leadership skills and promote teamwork across all grade levels. = Stage collapse = On March 8, 2014, the theater stage in the associate Servite High School collapsed during the performance of a stage play, injuring 25 young students.Official statement The group of Rosary actors were performing the comedy Theatrical at the time the collapse.Red & Gold - update for families 250 persons had been on the platform.Official Statement regarding March 8th at Servite High School Notable alumni * Kaitlin Cochran - softball four-time NCAA All-American, United States women's national softball team World Cup of Softball gold medalist * Natalie Golda Benson - United States women's national water polo team two-time Olympic medalist, two-time World Champion, Pan-American Games gold medalist, two-time NCAA All-American, Peter J.

Of the 400 episodic stories, roughly 52 of which have survived. Description The work consists of a series of anecdotes of social satire written and the narrative concerns the travels of a middle-aged man as he uses his charm and eloquence to swindle his way across the Arabic world.Esanu, O., Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude, Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.

They are narrated from the point of view of a fictitious character, 'very likely a traveling merchant who has money and time', ʿĪsā ibn Hishām, about the adventures of an eloquent beggar named Abū al-Fatḥ al- Iskandarī'. The Maqamat are also known for their intertextuality and narrative construction. According to Ailin Qian, > The core of the Hamadhānian maqāmah is dialogue, and al-Hamadhānī, by using > techniques such as isnād and framing, simulated some kind of public > presentation.

A century later, these maqamat inspired the maqamat of Al-Hariri of Basra, which in turn inspired the Hebrew Tahkemoni. The Abbasid artist and poet, Yahya Al-Wasiti, who lived in Baghdad in the late Abassid era (12th to 13th- centuries) and was one of the pre-eminent exponents of the Baghdad School, is known to have transcribed and illustrated the work in 1236-37, Maqamat (also known as the Assemblies or the Sessions).school,\\" in: Encyclopedia Britannica, Sample One of the numerous riddles in the work, in the rajaz metre, runs as follows: Pointed is his spearhead, sharp are his teeth, His progeny are his helpers, dissolving union is his business.

Plot synopsis Joker is about to remove Batman's mask, but the Caped Crusader escapes using a small Batmissle in his utility belt to set off the water sprinklers. Joker uses a smoke bomb to make his escape. As they are chasing him on the catwalks above, Joker uses trick streamers from his utility belt that wrap around Batman and Robin. He gets away before Batman and Robin can get themselves out of the confetti. When the Duo returns to the Batcave to attempt to divine the clown's next move, Joker temporarily hijacks a TV studio to broadcast another riddle as to his next crime. After solving it with Alfred's help, they track Joker to a warehouse and while in a struggle, Joker switches Batman's utility belt with his to enable his escape in the most humiliating way possible. Batman is selected to christen the S.S. Gotham. The Joker decides to fill a champagne bottle with paralyzing gas. On the day of the christening, a crowd gathers. Joker's henchwoman hands Commissioner Gordon the bottle who in turn hands it to Batman. As Batman looks over the bottle, he notices the cork has been tampered with. After taking a pill and saying he had a headache, he hands Robin one as well and tells him to take it because it may be catching. As the bottle is broken, it releases the gas and everyone is knocked out. Joker takes Batman and Robin back to his hideout (thinking they're knocked out) and broadcasts his ultimatum on television—either he gets the S.S. Gotham or Batman and Robin will be executed like the famous display in the wax museums. Batman and Robin spring into action having taken their Universal Drug Antidote Pill. The Joker is caught and brought to justice.  Next week narration  Batman versus Mr. Freeze!

He was one of the many Venetian-trained artists of his time, including Ricci, Tiepolo, Amigoni, and others, who sought commissions north of Italy, providing patrons with the then-popular Italianate grand-manner frescoes for private palaces. Biography Born and died in Pieve di Soligo. He initially trained with Domenico Difnico in Sebenico (Sibenik) in the Venetian colony of Dalmatia (now part of Croatia). By 1675, he was working in Venice, painting St Lorenzo Giustiniani praying for the city’s deliverance from the plague of 1447 (c. 1691) for the church of San Pietro di Castello. He painted a Nativity for the church of the Ascension at Venice. Several of the landscapes of Antonio Tempesta are enriched with figures by Bellucci. Among his pupils were Antonio Balestra and perhaps Jacopo Amigoni. In 1692, he completed four altarpieces depicting various saints for the church of Klosterneuburg. From 1695-1700 and 1702- c. 1704, he lived in Vienna. He painted the Triumph of Hercules and other allegorical ceilings at the Palais Liechtenstein for Charles VI. Ercole e Onfale (Hercules and Omphale) Lazzarini Room Ca' Rezzonico, Venice Career In 1705-1716, he travelled to Düsseldorf to work for Johann Wilhelm, Elector of the Palatinate, a member of the Wittelsbach family; he worked there almost continuously until his patron’s death in 1716. For Schloss Bensberg, he painted the Marriage of John William with Anna Maria Luisa de’ Medici and Elector Palatine John William Handing the Baton of Command to his Son.Both Bensberg paintings now at Alte Pinakothek of Munich. From 1716-1722, Bellucci worked in England, where he fulfilled several commissions for James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, including ceilings at Cannons, the duke's country seat near London;The house no longer exists, but paintings from the demolished chapel at Cannon were transferred to the church at Witley Court, Worcestershire. at the neighboring St Lawrence, Whitchurch the paintings of the Nativity and the Descent from the Cross, which are seen on either side of the altar, and the Transfiguration, which is above the Duke’s pew, are attributed to him. Website of Church There is an almost Romantic self-portrait of Belluci, shirt open, at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The reproduction here does not legibly show that on his breast is written the word 'pictor' (painter), perhaps indicating that to be an artist was his heart's desire. He returned to his native country late in life, and died at Soligo.

Musical studies Humberto Bruni first solo recital. Age 15 The musical studies of Humberto Bruni began at age fourteen, when he took the first music lessons from his father, Blas Bruni Celli. Shortly, he began his studies as a guitar performer under the guidance of Flaminia De Sola, at the \\"Juan Manuel Olivares\\" Conservatory of Music, in Caracas. Flaminia De Sola was a distinguished disciple of Andrés Segovia at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, Italy, founded by Count Guido Chigi Saracini in 1932 as an international centre for advanced musical studies. In 1973 at age fifteen, Humberto Bruni made his first public appearance with great success in a solo recital, after just a few months of musical training. In 1980, Bruni obtained the degree \\"Profesor Ejecutante de Guitarra\\" (English: \\"Performer and Professor of Guitar\\"). Career as a soloist with orchestra During 1980, Bruni made his first appearance as a soloist with the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar (Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra), under the baton of Alberto Grau, at the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex. Alberto Grau, founder and director of the world-renowned Schola Cantorum de Venezuela, conducted the Fantasía para un GentilHombre by Joaquín Rodrigo. The performance by Bruni of this Concerto for Guitar and Orchestra obtained such an incredible standing ovation that spanned for several consecutive minutes. In 1984, Bruni played the uttermost difficult piece for Guitar, the Concierto de Aranjuez for Guitar and Orchestra by Joaquín Rodrigo conducted by José Antonio Abreu. In 1995, UNESCO appointed Abreu as a Special Ambassador for the Development of a Global Network of Youth and Children Orchestras and Choirs. International career New England Conservatory of Music, Boston. (Jordan Hall) In 1980 at age 23, Bruni made his international debut in the United States of America with the Massachusetts Symphony Orchestra conducted by Harry Levenson at the Mechanics Hall, Worcester, Massachusetts. He also made a tour, including several recitals in the Boston area and in the Pacific coast. In December 1980, Bruni was admitted at the New England Conservatory of Music, in Boston, which is the oldest independent Conservatory of Music in the United States of America. There, he made graduate Classical Guitar studies with Robert Paul Sullivan. In 1984, Bruni got the degree \\"Master of Music\\" in Guitar Performance. On May 13, 1984, Peter Clemente and Bruni, performed for the first time along the US East Coast the \\"Concierto Madrigal\\" for Two Guitars and Orchestra by Joaquín Rodrigo. Since then, Bruni has given a considerable number of recitals and public appearances as soloist with orchestras in the United States, Venezuela, Caribbean Islands, Spain and Germany. Other fields of interest Humberto Bruni holds a Systems Engineering Degree obtained at the Universidad Metropolitana, in Caracas, Venezuela. His dissertation for obtaining the Systems Engineering Degree, involved Artificial Intelligence, specifically Artificial Neural Networks. Due to the novelty and innovations introduced by Bruni's Graduate Dissertation, the Universidad Metropolitana awarded it with the highest honors by the fulfillment of such a cutting-edge technology introduced for the first time in that institution. Among other studies, Bruni graduated in 2002 with honors at the IESA institute (Spanish: Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración) in Caracas, Venezuela, in an Executive MBA, (Spanish: PAG Programa Avanzado de Gerencia). Inventions Humberto Bruni has a powerful influence from his father, Dr. Blas Bruni Celli, who is a medical doctor in pathology and besides he is an avid amateur pianist. Dr. Bruni explained to his son, at a very young age, the musculature anatomy of the human body arms and fingers. Dr. Bruni Celli explained to his son the anatomic causes which are responsible for the ring finger drastic weakness in human hands. Since then, Humberto Bruni has been attracted with great intensity to overcome the ring finger weakness, as well as the development of the independence of the fingers in both hands. At age 14, Humberto Bruni invented his first device specially designed for his father. The invention was intended to exercise and strengthen the ring finger musculature. After a very short period of time, the results in the independence and strength of Humberto's father ring finger were just remarkable. This first experiment was a real milestone for Humberto Bruni of countless and meticulous observations about the mechanical nature of the human hands. Humberto Bruni's knowledge of digital electronics and his proficiency in computer programming, have led him design and develop many inventions to achieve the fingers independence in both hands of the human being. Among his inventions, there are several computer- controlled devices. These inventions have been tested with several guitar students, and it has been proven that they have statistical significance in developing the inter independence of the human hand fingers. The first prototypes are about to be patented in the United States of America. Present activities Bruni has his own recording studio specially designed for classical guitar recording in Florida. Bruni is under the close supervision of Leo Small, a sound engineer, in order to get the professional sound recording skills. Bruni is working on the recording of an \\"Anthology of Spanish Music for Guitar\\". He has been transcribing for guitar and record all the musical work for Lute by Johann Sebastian Bach. Bruni is writing an essay named \\"Breaking the Bach Code\\", which deals with the contribution of Johann Sebastian Bach to the modern guitar technique by means of several discoveries of logical fingering patterns found in Bach Lute Music.

This metric exists in addition to Amdahl's law and Gustafson's law as an indication of the extent to which a particular computer code is parallelized. It was proposed by Alan H. Karp and Horace P. Flatt in 1990. Description Given a parallel computation exhibiting speedup \\\\psi on p processors, where p > 1, the experimentally determined serial fraction e is defined to be the Karp–Flatt Metric viz: :e = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\psi}-\\\\frac{1}{p}}{1-\\\\frac{1}{p}} The lower the value of e, the better the parallelization. Justification There are many ways to measure the performance of a parallel algorithm running on a parallel processor. The Karp–Flatt metric defines a metric which reveals aspects of the performance that are not easily discerned from other metrics. A pseudo-\\"derivation\\" of sorts follows from Amdahl's Law, which can be written as: :T(p) = T_s + \\\\frac{T_p}{p} Where: *T(p) is the total time taken for code execution in a p-processor system *T_s is the time taken for the serial part of the code to run *T_p is the time taken for the parallel part of the code to run in one processor *p is the number of processors with the result obtained by substituting p = 1 viz. T(1) = T_s + T_p, if we define the serial fraction e = \\\\frac{T_s}{T(1)} then the equation can be rewritten as :T(p) = T(1) e + \\\\frac{T(1) (1-e)}{p} In terms of the speedup \\\\psi = \\\\frac{T(1)}{T(p)} : :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\psi} = e + \\\\frac{1-e}{p} Solving for the serial fraction, we get the Karp–Flatt metric as above. Note that this is not a \\"derivation\\" from Amdahl's law as the left hand side represents a metric rather than a mathematically derived quantity. The treatment above merely shows that the Karp–Flatt metric is consistent with Amdahl's Law. Use While the serial fraction e is often mentioned in computer science literature, it was rarely used as a diagnostic tool the way speedup and efficiency are. Karp and Flatt hoped to correct this by proposing this metric. This metric addresses the inadequacies of the other laws and quantities used to measure the parallelization of computer code. In particular, Amdahl's law does not take into account load balancing issues, nor does it take overhead into consideration. Using the serial fraction as a metric poses definite advantages over the others, particularly as the number of processors grows. For a problem of fixed size, the efficiency of a parallel computation typically decreases as the number of processors increases.

The symphony is scored for 2 oboes (2nd alternating on flute in the second movement), 2 bassoons, 2 horns and strings and is in three movements: #Vivace #Andantino, in A major #Allegro assai The first movement is notable among Haydn's works for the use of tremolo notation as a shortcut for repeated semiquavers. The second movement, like the slow movements of other symphonies in the set, treats the woodwinds in an almost concertante fashion. The third movement is a lively rondo with a little development in minor keys of the A subject before the final restatement in D major. Though the bassoon is for the most part doubling the cellos, towards the end Haydn has them imitate the twirls of the first violins a bar after, lending a hint of wit redolent of Joseph Haydn's rondo finales.

A Roman tombstone of the 2nd century is included into the walls of the Saint Michael filial church. The earliest mention of Feldkirchen is as Ueldchiricha (\\"Church in the Fields\\") in an 888 document by Arnulf of Carinthia. The parish church Maria im Dorn, a Romanesque basilica with a Carolingian choir, is one of the oldest sacred buildings in Carinthia. Feldkirchen, once an estate of the Eppenstein noble family, was bequeathed to the Diocese of Bamberg in 1166. The bishops had the Amthof erected, the former seat of the local administration, today a place for cultural events and a small museum. Finally Maria Theresa of Austria acquired Feldkirchen in 1759. The village of Markstein south of the town centre is a former checkpoint at the border between the Austrian Empire and the Upper Carinthian part of the short-lived Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces. The building of a customs station and a border stone remained. Feldkirchen received town privileges in 1930.

Some symphonies add more instruments, such as trumpets and timpani in some of the C major symphonies. They are usually either in three or four movements. Continuo is explicitly called for only in the earlier works, and the modern editions usually follow the old practice of putting the bassoons, basses and the left hand of the continuo on a single staff below the violas' staff.

French poet and critic Boileau is ranked 20th, beneath Tasso and Ariosto but above Francis Bacon, John Milton Miguel de Cervantes and Molière. (William Shakespeare, Dante, Cornielle and Racine aren't on the list at all).) In some accompanying prose, Akenside wrote: :At the next trumpet, the tutelary of France went out with the assured air that was natural to her, and brought in a tall, slender man in a large wig, with a very fine sneer upon his face. She said his name was Boileau and that nobody could pretend to dispute that place with him. However, the stately genius of England opposed her; her remonstrances prevailed, and Pope took the place which Boileau thought belonged to him. The second list, \\"The Balance of Poets\\", is a table, giving 20 modern and 20 ancient poets marks of up to 20 points in each of the following categories: Critical Ordonnance, Pathetic Ordonnance, Dramatic Ordonnance, Incidental Expression, Taste, Colouring, Versification, Moral, and Final Estimate. Boileau's \\"Final Estimate\\" rating is 12, the same as Euripides and Tasso, better than Lucretius and Terence (who both get 10), Ariosto, Dante, Horace, Pindar, Alexander Pope, Racine and Sophocles each get 13. \\"Perhaps neither of these curiosities of criticism is to be taken very seriously\\", wrote Alexander Clark, an early 20th-century literary historian.

Districts History Serae/ Seraye (Tigrigna Tigre(Geez) ሰራየ) was a region (awraja ኣውራጃ) of the Kingdom of D'mt ዳእማት ወይ ዳዕማት, which would evolve in the Aksum ኣክሱም and later on the center of kingdom of Medri Bahri(ምድሪ ባሕሪ) centered in Debarwa(ድባርዋ) with its leaders Bahri Negasi(ባሕሪ ነጋሲ). Seraye was bound by regions of Akeleguzay(ኣከለ ጉዛይ) in the east, Hamassien (ሓማሴን) in the North, Tigray proper( ዓድዋ፡ሽረ፡ኣክሱም) in the south and Gashin Setitn(ጋሽን ሰቲትን) in the west During this Axumite period, the region became a successful trading region as it lay between the Red Sea port of Adulis ኣዱሊስ, Asmara ኣስመራ, and Axum ኣክሱም. Serae appears on indigenous maps of the northern Horn of Africa in the 15th Century.Nyssen, J., Tesfaalem Ghebreyohannes, Hailemariam Meaza, Dondeyne, S., 2020.

The region(Awraja ኣውራጃ) had its own written native administration codes that was used from the beginning of the 1400AD, which was named as the law of Adkeme-Miligae ሕጊ ኣድከመ ምልጋእ. The book existed until the come of the anti Christian jihadist Ahmad Gragn ኣሕመድ ግራይ in the 1600s, burning churches and killing the believers and progressing northwards from present-day eastern Ethiopia or around Somalia, and the book was lost/burnt at that time. The people of Serae/ Seraye were administered without the book verbally until the come of the Italians in the end of the 19th century. In 1938 again the book of native law code was written of elderly and knowledgeable people from 7 villages (Adi Mongonti ዓዲ ሞንጐንቲ, Mayduma ማይዱማ, Kudo Felasi ኩዶ ፈላሲ, Bet Gabriel ቤት ገብርኤል, Qine Hayela ቅነ ሓየላ, Adi Hyis ዓዲ ሕይስ, and May Leham ማይ ለሓም) representing the whole awraja Seraye except the Logo Tchiwa ሎጎ ጭዋ which had its own codes in addition to the Adkeme Miligae. This Law had more liberal customs and low restrictions on women's rights for land ownership than any other laws in the country. Most of Seraye and Akeleguzay are together now inside the Southern region (ዞባ ደቡብ).

He was one of the most famous and experienced figures in German airship travel. The Pittsburgh Press called Lehmann the best airship pilot in the world, although he was criticized by Hugo Eckener for often making dangerous maneuvers that compromised the airships. He was a victim of the Hindenburg disaster in 1937.  Pre-war experience  Ernst Lehmann was born in 1886 in Ludwigshafen am Rhein.Krug At the age of 14, he decided that he wanted to build ships. He studied engineering at the Technische Hochschule Berlin and received his degree in 1912. By this time, he had already joined the navy and had attained the rank of naval reserve lieutenant. Upon graduation, he began work at the Imperial Dockyards in Kiel. He did not find this work satisfying so, encouraged by Dr. Hugo Eckener, he joined the DELAG to serve as pilot of the passenger airship LZ 17 Sachsen. He commanded a total of 550 flights of this ship.  Service during World War I  During the First World War, Captain Lehmann commanded army and navy airships, beginning with the Sachsen after it had been taken over by the Army, followed by the LZ XII,Lehmann Chapter V and finally the navy ships LZ 90, LZ 98, and LZ 120. His attack on Antwerp (Belgium) on August 25th/26th (during the night) was the first bombing from the air of civilians in world history, killing 10 people.  Post-war commercial airship travel  After the war, Captain Lehmann continued his involvement with the airships, which were returned to civilian use. He made preparations to fly the naval airship L 72 on the first transatlantic crossing of an airship in 1919, but permission was denied by the German government. In 1920, he spent six months in Sweden studying the economics of an airship line between Stockholm and the Mediterranean, with a stopover in Friedrichshafen. These plans were never realized. Captain Lehmann is interviewed by NBC after the first US landing of the Hindenburg on 9 May 1936. In 1921 he spent four months in the United States to prepare for a planned New York to Chicago airship route, and in 1922 he tried to negotiate with the United States and England for a route to go over North Atlantic . With the founding of the Goodyear Zeppelin Corporation in 1923, Captain Lehmann served as Vice President in charge of engineering. In 1924, Captain Lehmann was second-in-command of LZ 126 on the first nonstop transatlantic flight between the European and American mainlands. The purpose of the flight was to deliver the Zeppelin to its new owners, the United States Navy, who rechristened the ship USS Los Angeles. By 1929, Lehmann had filed a declaration of intent to become a United States citizen, but changed his mind when he was given charge of the Hindenburg in 1936. In 1935, when Hermann Göring created the Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei to increase Nazi influence over zeppelin operations, Captain Lehmann was named director of the new airline. Captain Lehmann served as commanding officer on more than 100 of the flights of the Graf Zeppelin between 1928 and 1936. In 1936, he commanded 10 round- trip flights to Lakehurst on the new Hindenburg. Captain Lehmann was a skilled accordion player, which he often used to entertain passengers on long flights with renditions of Wagner pieces or German folk songs.  Death  Although Max Pruss was the commanding officer of the last flight of the Hindenburg, Captain Lehmann was the most senior officer on board, but was there only as an observer. He was severely burned when the ship caught fire at Lakehurst on 6 May 1937, and died the following day. It was initially believed that Lehmann would recover from his injuries; he was scheduled to be transferred to the hospital at Rockefeller University for further treatment until he took a sudden turn for the worse in the morning before his death. At his death, he apparently believed that the Hindenburg was sabotaged. He came out of the burning wreckage saying \\"I don't understand it.\\" During a deathbed conversation with Commander Charles Emery Rosendahl, he said \\"it must have been an infernal machine.\\" Lehmann's two-year-old son had died on Easter Sunday, 28 March 1937, a few weeks prior to the Hindenburg's last crossing and he did not really want to make the voyage. Lehmann accepted the assignment with the hope that by doing so he might have the opportunity to speak to US authorities about the use of helium gas in the German airships. Criticism Lehmann often came into conflict with Hugo Eckener over the safety of his piloting techniques. Lehmann cancelled important flight tests for the Hindenburg to fulfill a request by the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda for the Hindenburg and the Graf Zeppelin to take part in a propaganda flight (Deutschlandfahrt) in support of Adolf Hitler. Lehmann insisted on making the flight despite unfavorable weather conditions, which resulted in high winds damaging the Hindenburgs lower fin as the airship was being removed from its hanger. Eckener criticised Lehmann harshly and publicly for endangering the new airship and the entire zeppelin program to impress the Nazis. However, Lehmann never actually joined the Nazi Party despite his apparent support. (Only Max Pruss and Anton Wittemann of the seven active zeppelin commanders were Party members of the NSDAP). After Lehmann's death, Eckener blamed Pruss's handling of the airship but also suggested that Lehmann was responsible for pressuring Pruss to make the flight. Although Eckener did not rule out other causes, after investigating the disaster himself, he testified to the inquiry that a sharp S-turn during the landing procedure might have caused a bracing wire to break and tear a gasbag, and resulted in mixture of hydrogen with air, which then likely was ignited by an electrostatic discharge. Portrayals In the 1975 film The Hindenburg, Captain Lehmann was portrayed by Richard Dysart, although this portrayal is quite inaccurate with Lehmann appearing wary of the Nazis, whereas the real Lehmann was a well-known Nazi supporter, at least publicly. In the 2007 docudrama Hindenburg: The Untold Story, Polish actor Aleksander Trabczynski portrayed Lehmann. In the fictional 2011 RTL television movie of the disaster, he was portrayed by Ulrich Noethen. In this film, he supports the Gestapo in their brutal torture of Merten Kroger for the alleged murder of a passenger, but orders his release upon seeing proof of a bomb aboard the ship. During the landing approach, he pushes the landing approach and ignores Kroger's warning that putting stress on the ships frame would be dangerous, saying it's \\"less dangerous than a bomb going off\\". He is proven wrong when although the bomb is defused, the airship explodes due to static electricity.  Books  Captain Lehmann published his first book in English with Howard Mingos in New York and in 1927 it was reprinted in London. The Zeppelins: The Development of the Airship, with the Story of the Zeppelins Air Raids in the World War. Captain Lehmann recounts his personal experiences as a zeppelin captain in war and peace in Auf Luftpatrouille und Weltfahrt: Erlebnisse eines Zeppelin Fuhrers in Krieg und Frieden. Captain Lehmann's last book, Zeppelin: The Story of Lighter-than-air Craft, was being translated by Leonhard Adelt, who was on board with Lehmann as a guest during the Hindenburgs last flight. The book had recently been published in German when the Hindenburg was destroyed. The English translation, completed by Jay Dratler, was published later in 1937 with a preface and closing chapter by the American airship captain Charles E. Rosendahl, who had interviewed Lehmann on his deathbed.  Footnotes   References  *Lehmann, Ernst A.; Mingos, Howard. The Zeppelins.

It became an extension (and eventual successor) to the ATI Wonder series of cards. The first chip in the series was the ATI Mach8. It was essentially a clone of the IBM 8514/A with a few notable extensions such as Crystal fonts. Being one of the first graphics accelerator chips on the market, the Mach8 did not have an integrated VGA core. In order to use the first Mach8 coprocessor cards, a separate VGA card was required. This increased the cost of ownership as one had to purchase two rather than one expansion card for graphics. A temporary solution was presented with the ATI Graphics Ultra/Vantage cards, which combined an ATI 8514 Ultra and VGA Wonder+ into a single card (though using discrete ICs). The Mach32 chip was the follow-up to the Mach8, which finally featured an integrated VGA core, true colour support and a 64-bit datapath to internal memory.

Born in Breslau in the German Empire (now Wrocław, Poland), she was forced to leave Germany during the Nazi regime because she was Jewish. She continued her academic career in the United States, where she settled for the rest of her life.  Biography  = Early life = Born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), Kohn was the daughter of Georg Kohn, a wholesale merchant of fine cloth, and Helene Hancke, a member of a well-to-do family. Her parents were both German Jews. In 1907, Kohn became the second woman to enter the physics department of Breslau University (Universität Breslau, now University of Wrocław). She obtained her doctorate in physics under Otto Lummer in 1913 and was soon appointed as Lummer's assistant. She stayed at the university's Physics Institute during World War I and obtained her habilitation in 1930. Kohn was trained by Lummer in the quantitative determination of the intensity of light, both from broad- band sources, such as a \\"black body\\", and from the discrete emission lines of atoms and molecules. = Escape from Germany = Kohn was dismissed from her position in 1933 due to Nazi regulations which barred Jews from government service (the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service). She survived by fulfilling contracts for applied research in the illumination industry until 1938, when she found herself without work or financial resources. Offered temporary positions at three women's colleges in the United States through the aid of Rudolf Ladenburg, Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer, the American Association of University Women (AAUW), and many others, Kohn left Germany. She had been given a visa to the United Kingdom in 1939, but it was cancelled because of World War II; she eventually secured a visa to travel to Sweden and immediately went there in July 1940. On receiving a visa from the United States, she then moved there. The journey to her first position at the Women's College of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro took Kohn through Berlin, Stockholm, Leningrad, Moscow, Vladivostok, Yokohama, San Francisco, and Chicago. = Life in United States = When Kohn arrived in the United States in January 1941, she was seriously ill. After recovering, Kohn taught at the Women's College of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro for a year and a half. In 1942, she began teaching at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She started as a lecturer, became an associate professor in 1945, and then was awarded full professorship in 1948. Kohn established a research laboratory for flame spectroscopy while at the college. She was a member of a number of professional associations in the United States, including the American Physical Society, the American Association of Physics Teachers, and Sigma Xi: The Scientific Research Honor Society. Upon Kohn's retirement as professor in 1952, Hertha Sponer, then professor of physics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, offered her a position as a research associate. Kohn set up a laboratory at Duke University and resumed research, where she guided two graduate students to their doctorates and recruited two post-doctoral fellows to assist in her study of flame spectroscopy. She worked there until very shortly before her death in 1964.  Legacy  Kohn was trained by Otto Lummer in the quantitative determination of the intensity of light, both from broad-band sources, such as a \\"black body\\", and from the discrete emission lines of atoms and molecules. She further developed such methods and devised ways of extracting information from intensity measurements and from emission line shapes. She wrote 270 pages in the leading physics text of the 1930s and 1940s in Germany, received one patent, and wrote numerous articles in scientific journals, some of which were still being cited into the 2000s. Two of her students became professors in Germany. A Google Doodle on 5 April 2019 commemorated Kohn's 132nd birth anniversary.  Published works  * Müller-Pouillets Lehrbuch der Physik. (II.

She was the favorite concubine of Chen's final emperor, Chen Shubao. It is not known when Zhang Lihua was born. She was the daughter of a soldier, but her family was so poor that her father and older brother had to support the family by sewing seating pads. After Chen Shubao became crown prince in 569 after his father Emperor Xuan took the throne, she was initially selected into the palace to serve as a servant to his concubine Consort Gong. When Chen Shubao saw her, however, he was infatuated with her and took her as a concubine. She bore two sons -- Chen Yuan and Chen Zhuang (陳莊). (It is not clear whether she bore any of his at least six daughters.) Emperor Xuan died in 582, and Chen Shubao, after surviving a coup attempt by his brother Chen Shuling (陳叔陵) the Prince of Shixing and cousin Chen Bogu (陳伯固) the Prince of Xin'an, took the throne. Chen Shubao created his wife Crown Princess Shen Wuhua empress, and created Consort Zhang an imperial consort with the honored title of Guifei (貴妃) -- the highest rank for imperial consorts. In the coup attempt, Chen Shubao suffered serious injuries, and Consort Zhang attended to him in the illness, as he did not favor Empress Shen and did not allow Empress Shen to attend to him. She became even more favored than before, and she effectively became the ruler of his palace notwithstanding that Empress Shen was empress. Chen Shubao had a large number of concubines—10 of whom were said to be favored—but Consort Zhang continued to be his favorite. He constructed three particularly luxurious pavilions within his palace—Linchun Pavilion (臨春閣), Jieqi Pavilion (結綺閣), and Wangxian Pavilion (望仙閣), residing himself at Linchun Pavilion, while having Consort Zhang reside at Jieqi Pavilion and Consorts Gong and Kong share Wangxian Pavilion. He often spent his days feasting with his concubines, headed by Consort Zhang, as well as those ladies in waiting and officials who had literary talent, having those officials sing or write poetry to praise his concubines' beauty. Two of the particularly known songs, Yushu Houting Hua (玉樹後庭花) and Linchun Yue (臨春樂), were written to praise the beauties of Consorts Zhang and Kong. Consort Zhang was said to be particularly capable at dressing herself and decorating herself beautifully, as well as engaging witches to pray to gods to help her stay beautiful. At times, her beauty was compared to goddesses. As Chen Shubao was not much interested in the matters of state, whenever he had important petitions to decide on, he would hold Consort Zhang on his lap and have her read the petition and rule on it. She therefore became very powerful politically as well, and so she and Consort Kong (who, while not related to the high-level official Kong Fan (孔範), referred to Kong Fan as her brother) became ones that people would bribe and beg when they had special requests. The officials soon were forced to first discuss important matters with Consorts Zhang and Kong before they could discuss them with the emperor. Because of Chen Shubao's favor for Consort Zhang, he also most favored her sons Chen Yuan and Chen Zhuang among his sons. In 588, he deposed his oldest son and crown prince Chen Yin because he suspected Chen Yin (who, while not born of Empress Shen, was raised by her and considered her son) of despising him for not favoring Empress Shen. He replaced Chen Yin with Chen Yuan. In 589, the Sui dynasty launched a major attack, and with Chen Shubao not paying attention to his generals requesting aid, Sui forces were quickly able to reach and capture the Chen capital Jiankang. Chen Shubao and Consorts Zhang and Kong hid in a well, but were eventually found and taken captive. Chen Shubao was spared (and eventually treated with kindness by Emperor Wen of Sui), as were Chen Yuan and Chen Zhuang, but the Sui general Gao Jiong, blaming her for Chen's collapse and comparing her to Daji, the wicked wife of King Zhou of Shang who was beheaded by the Zhou dynasty general Jiang Ziya after Zhou conquered Shang, beheaded her despite an order from Emperor Wen's son Yang Guang the Prince of Jin, who commanded the entire operation, to spare her. (Whether Yang Guang wanted to seize her as his own concubine can only be speculated.) In 607, after Yang Guang had succeeded Emperor Wen in 604 (as Emperor Yang), he executed Gao after Gao who had expressed disagreement with him on the large amount of award that he was giving to Tujue's submissive Qimin Khan. Many traditional historians believed that he was punishing Gao for having executed Consort Zhang despite his order.

Life and work Born in Brackenheim, Germany as Heinrich Alfred Kreiser, he immigrated to New York City in 1846, where he worked as a butcher. He came out to California in 1850 under the name Henry Miller, a name borrowed from the non-transferable steamer ticket he had purchased from a friend in New York. Miller built up a thriving butcher business in San Francisco, later going into partnership with Charles Lux, also a German immigrant and a former competitor, in 1858. The Miller and Lux company expanded rapidly, shifting emphasis from meat products to cattle raising, and soon became the largest producer of cattle in California and one of the largest landowners in the United States, owning directly and controlling nearly of cattle and farm land in California, Nevada, and Oregon.Igler, David.

He also \\"kept the local officials, particularly the county assessors, in his debt.\\" McWilliams, Carey. (1935) \\"Factories in the Fields\\". Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. The Miller and Lux Corporation was headquartered in Los Banos, on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. Miller played a major role in the development of much of the San Joaquin Valley during the late 19th century and early 20th century. His role in maintaining and managing his corporate farming empire illustrates the growing trend of industrial barons during the Gilded Age. His detailed correspondences with Superintendent Turner reflects his micromanagement business style and underscores the lack of autonomy of rural farmers in the region. Miller persistently corresponded with his subordinates in order to verify that all the cattle met his standards before being sold. The correspondences demonstrate his attention to detail, especially in regards to the weather conditions and the amount of food and water the ranches contained.Henry Miller Papers Collection, \\"Correspondance to Superintendent Turner,\\" 18 July 1912, Special Collections, Henry Madden Library, California State University, Fresno In 1910, his upstream water rights to the San Joaquin River, which crossed much of the company's land, were acquired by the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project; the project's planned reservoir storage of snowmelt would greatly reduce flooding and increase river flow during the dry season.

Life Born into a rich agrarian family on 27 May 1842 at Kuravilangad, Kathanar entered spiritual service at the age of 19 as a deacon. He continued as deacon for 14 years before he was ordained priest in 1876. He was lived in a delicate period of the history of Syro-Malabar Church; it was subdued to the Latin hierarchy and was struggling to become a Major Archiepiscopal Church. During this time, the whole nation of India was revolting against British administration for independence. Therefore, Emmanuel Nidhiri had to confront and respond to the freedom struggles of the community against British dynasty and its ecclesial desire to become an autonomous churchJ. KACHIRAMATTOM, Christians and National Associations (ക്രൈസ്തവരും ദേശീയപ്രസ്ഥാനങ്ങളും), Kachiramattom Foundation, Pala-Kerala 2006(Malayalam language). Kathanar died on 20 June 1904 due to unknown reasons. Contributions * Education : Kathanar was one of the key figure in the opening up English education in Kerala. He played an instrumental role in opening English education to the Syriac Catholic community. He advised Catholic parishes to sell their crucifixes made of gold and silver and to invest the amount in starting schools. * Media : Kathanar was the founder- editor of the first Malayalam daily, Deepika. He was instrumental in the founding of another newspaper, the Malayala Manorama. * Social Reforms : He was the moving spirit behind the Malayali Memorial of 1891. Thos was one of the first steps in the social transformation of Kerala. Following the formation of the Travancore Legislative Council in 1888, the Malayali Memorial, a memorandum bearing the signatures of over 10,000 people, including a sprinkling of Ezhavas, Christians, and Muslims was submitted to the Maharaja, Moolam Thirunal. This was as a result of the emergence of a Tamil Brahmin monopoly of policy positions in government and the subsequent decline of the caste groups from within Kerala. * Poet and Writer : He wrote number of poems and authored three Malayalam books. * Ecumenicalism : The ecumenical association, Nazrani Jathiaikya Sangham organized by Nidhiry Mani Kathanar and Mar Dionysius, the Jacobite Syrian Christian ChurchMetropolitan was one of the important happenings in Syrian Christians history. They acquired property at Kottayam for building a college in ca 1875. They planned for opening jointly colleges, schools, orphanages, library, bank etc. The project got aborted by the diplomatic approach of Carmelite apostolic delegate Aiuti who was afraid of unity among the Syrian Christians. It was the leadership of Nidhiry that fostered a unity among Syriac Catholics with in and with Jacobites. * Apologist of faith : He led the community in its fight against the European hegemony over the Nasrani Christians. It was with the fight of Syriac Catholic under the leadership of Kathanar that freed them from Padroado jurisdiction paving the way for indigenous Bishops. * Historian :He has also authored number of church history books and was in the forefront in upholding the Chaldean patrimony of the Syro Malabar Church.

It is a popular aquarium species. It has typically been recognized as the only true freshwater pufferfish of South America, but a study in 2013 recommended that the population in the Tocantins River basin (quite similar to C. asellus in appearance, but differs in genetics) should be considered as a separate species, C. tocantinensis.Amaral, C.R.L.; P.M. Brito; D.A. Silva; and E.F. Carvalho (2013). A new cryptic species of South American freshwater pufferfish of the genus Colomesus (Tetraodontidae), based on both morphology and DNA data. PLoS ONE 8(9): e74397. This is followed by Catalog of Fishes, but not FishBase.  Description  The coloration of this fish is green above, white below, and patterned with black transverse bands across the dorsal surface. Compared with Colomesus psittacus, the black bands on the back are much thicker, and it also has a distinctive black band that rings the base of the caudal fin. This species grows to a length of SL. It is known to contain the toxin saxitoxin.  Ecology  Colomesus asellus is normally only found in freshwater environments although it will tolerate slightly brackish water. Wild Colomesus asellus are reported to consume benthic crustaceans, fish, planktonic invertebrates, and plants. Aquarium specimens consume various invertebrates including midge larvae and Mysida. Like other pufferfish, they have the ability to inflate themselves when threatened, making themselves much larger and therefore more difficult for predators to handle or swallow. Colomesus asellus is unusual among freshwater pufferfish for being migratory and non-territorial. Colomesus asellus is known to breed during the wet season, spawning in rivers, with the numerous small eggs being scattered on the substrate and the larvae drifting downstream. Colomesus asellus is nearly impossible to breed in the aquarium because their eggs are very small and they go through a planktonic phase before growing into \\"real fish. In the aquarium Colomesus asellus is fairly widely kept as an aquarium fish. An aquarium tank with volume of at least 109 liters is required ( approx. 29 US gallons). Compared to other freshwater pufferfish, Colomesus asellus is unusual in being tolerant of conspecifics and tends to be nervous when kept singly. It is known to be a fin-nipper and could attack slow moving species such as angelfish, guppies, and Corydoras. Colomesus asellus has some of the fastest growing teeth of the freshwater puffers so, feeding crunchy foods and possibly having to do dentistry are two important factors.

Description  The coloration of this fish is green above, white below, and patterned with black transverse bands across the dorsal surface. Compared with Colomesus asellus, the black bands on the back are much thinner, and it also lacks a distinctive black band that rings the base of the caudal fin. This species grows to a length of SL. This species is known to have edible flesh but a toxic liver but whether it contains saxitoxin or tetrodotoxin (as is the case with many marine puffers) is not known.  Ecology  It is a euryhaline species that moves freely between freshwater and the sea. The natural diet of Colomesus psittacus is carnivorous and consists mainly of molluscs. In the aquarium they eat a variety of invertebrates including snails, clams and shrimps. Like other pufferfish, they have the ability to inflate themselves when threatened, making themselves much larger and therefore more difficult for predators to handle or swallow.  Aquarium keeping  Because of its large size and need for salt water, Colomesus psittacus is rarely kept in home aquaria, but it is otherwise similar to Colomesus asellus in terms of maintenance. It is not a schooling species and may be aggressive towards others of its species, so is usually kept alone.

The name of the town probably comes from ancient Polish given name Sąd, which was popular in the noble Odrowąż family in the 13th century. In the past, Sędziszów was also known as Shendishov, Sandissów, Sandyszów, Schandzyssów, and Sandzischów. The town is home to a sports club Lechia, established in 1914.  Location  In the Middle Ages, Sędziszów Małopolski was located on the border between the Kingdom of Poland and Red Ruthenia. In 1340, after King Kazimierz Wielki annexed Ruthenia, Sędziszów lost its status of a border town. The town lies between two geographical regions of Poland - the Carpathian Mountains, and Sandomierz Basin. Sędziszów's area is almost , and the town is divided into 5 districts (osiedla). Sędziszów Małopolski lies along European route E40 as well as major rail line E30, which goes from Kraków towards the border with Ukraine.  History  First mentions about Sędziszów Małopolski come from 1320s, when its parish church belonged to the deanery at Dębica. The village belonged to the Odrowąż family, and due to efforts of Jan Odrowąż, Sędziszów was incorporated as a town on February 28, 1483, by King Kazimierz Jagiellończyk. In 1512 Sędziszów received the rights to organize weekly markets (on Tuesdays), and in 1555, the town passed to the hands of the Tarnowski family. In the 1620s, it belonged to Mikołaj Spytko Ligęza, who built roads and strengthened river banks. In 1649 Sędziszów Małopolski belonged to the Lubomirski family, and the town suffered in the 1650s. First, there was a plague, which decimated the population (1652), then, during the deluge, Sędziszów was destroyed by the army of George II Rakoczi. In 1661, the town passed on to the Potocki family, as a dowry in a wedding of Feliks Kazimierz Potocki with Krystyna Lubomirska. The Potockis made several investments in Sędziszów Małopolski, building a town hall, a new parish church and a monastery. In the 18th century Sędziszów was frequently looted and burned - among others, during the Great Northern War and the Bar Confederation. In 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), Sędziszów was annexed by the Austrian Empire, and in a fire of 1817, large parts of the town were destroyed. Between 1856-1858 Sędziszów received rail connections with Kraków and Lwów, and in the First World War, the town was seized by the Russians in September 1914. The Austrians managed to push them out in May 1915, and the retreating Russians set the town on fire. In the 1930s, Sędziszów Małopolski became one of centers of the Central Industrial Region, and in 1937, a new factory Zakłady Przemysłowe Sędziszów Małopolski was opened. On September 8, 1939, the town was captured by the Wehrmacht. The Germans opened here a ghetto, in which in mid-1942 there were 1,500 local Jews. In July 1942, the Germans murdered 280 Jews at the ghetto, and the remaining population was transported to Belzec extermination camp, where they perished. Sędziszów Małopolski was an important center of the Home Army, whose units participated in Operation Tempest. The town was captured by the Soviets on August 4, 1944.  Points of interest  * rectangular-shaped town hall, built in the 17th century, and remodelled in the 19th century, * late Baroque parish church (1694–1699), which replaced the earlier wooden church, burned by the soldiers of George II Rakoczi, * church and monastery (1739–1741), * ruins of the 18th century army barracks for the private army of Mikolaj Potocki, * cemetery chapel (1844), * Jewish cemetery, destroyed by the Germans in 1942 - 43, with a monument dedicated to the people murdered on July 24, 1942. When Peenemünde was bombed in Aug 1943, the Germans relocated the V-2 rocket test facility in the forests just a few kilometres northwest of Sędziszów Małopolski near Blizna. The first A-4 version test flight from Blizna took place on Nov 5 1943. The Germans had easy transportation on the railroad to Dębica, Ropczyce and Sędziszów Małopolski. At the peak of operations in 1944 as many as 10 rocket firing per day were conducted from Blizna. The last launch was in July 1944. The area was too far for the British to conduct reconnaissance flights, so it was't until the Russians advanced to take the base away from the German SS Commander in August 1944 that the rockets were investigated. The huge underground bunkers and facility are still visible today. The polish underground spied on the facility and informed the British and Americans of the new v-2 location. One V-2 failed falling into the bug river and was recovered by the Polish resistance before the Germans arrived. The parts were smuggled to England.Spaceweb  References  External links *Official town webpage Early 20th Century postcard showing church of The Nativity of Mary in Sędziszów Małopolski Category:Cities and towns in Podkarpackie Voivodeship Category:Ropczyce- Sędziszów County Category:Lesser Poland Category:Sandomierz Voivodeship Category:Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Kraków Voivodeship (1919–1939) Category:Holocaust locations in Poland ","title":"Sędziszów Małopolski"},{"id":"9453456","text":"Avon () is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France.

Avon is built between two hills; one of them, known as the Butte Montceau, supports the homonymous neighbourhood, made of small blocks and houses; on the opposite one is built the Fougères neighbourhood, consisting of larger buildings. The rest of the town consists mainly of small houses, in the neighbourhoods of La Vallée and Vieil Avon. As previously said, the town is nested in the Fontainebleau forest; it is bordered on one side by the Seine river, crossed over by the Pont de Valvins.

Nakadate's 2005 solo show at Danziger Projects, \\"Love Hotel and Other Stories\\", was featured in The New York Times, The Village Voice, and Flash Art. Art critic Jerry Saltz named her a \\"standout\\" in the 2005 \\"Greater New York\\" show at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, Long Island City, N.Y. Since then, Nakadate's work has been exhibited at the Getty Museum, Los Angeles; the Asia Society, New York; the Reina Sofia, Madrid; the Berlin Biennial; Grand Arts, Kansas City; and at Leslie Tonkonow Artworks + Projects, New York. A ten-year retrospective of her work, called Only the Lonely, was on view at MoMA PS1 from January 23 to August 8, 2011. A cover interview with the artist appeared in the October 2006 issue of The Believer. Nakadate's first feature-length film, Stay The Same Never Change, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, on January 16, 2009, and was featured in the 2009 New Directors/New Films Festival at The Museum of Modern Art and Lincoln Center.

Nakadate currently lives and works in New York City. Work Laurel Nakadate is known for creating video and photographic works that explore themes of sexuality, femininity and gender roles, and the knife-edge between vulnerability and power within chance encounters. Nakadate has often used herself as a subject within her work, documenting her interactions with strangers in various settings. Tonally, her work has been described as \\"disturbingly intimate\\",\\" as well as \\"creepy\\" art where \\"voyeurism, exhibitionism, and hostility merge with gullibility, cunning, and folly.\\" Her newer photographic work, Relations, explores Nakadate's own genealogy through photos of distant relatives. Her feature film The Wolf Knife continues Nakadate's common themes of voyeurism, connection, and intimacy. Reception New York Times critic Ken Johnson called her \\"smart and scarily adventurous.\\" She was also featured in the book 25 Under 25: Up-and-Coming American Photographers.''

Early life  Selina Bunbury was born at Kilsaran Rectory near Castlebellingham, County Louth. She was a twin, and one of fifteen children of a Protestant minister, Rev. Henry Bunbury. The Bunbury family moved to Dublin in 1819, and to Liverpool about 1830.  Career  Bunbury was a prolific author, writing nearly a hundred volumes of both fiction and non-fiction, for young readers and a general audience, beginning with Visit to my Birthplace (1821). Her writing had \\"a strong proselytizing and moral component\\". \\"Miss Bunbury is an experienced, an observant, and a discriminating traveller,\\" commented an 1853 reviewer, \\"with but one fault we can discover — a violent Tractarian tinge, which, however, does not render her book less amusing.\\" Bunberry traveled from Stockholm to Rome in 1847 and 1848, becoming a first-hand witness to revolution and upheaval in several parts of Europe. Her travel writing included My Early Adventures During the Peninsular Campaign of Napoleon (1834), Evenings in the Pyrenees (1845), A visit to the catacombs, or first Christian cemeteries of Rome, and a midnight visit to mount Vesuvius (1849), Evelyn, or, A journey from Stockholm to Rome in 1847-48 (1849), Life in Sweden (1853), A Summer in Northern Europe (1856), Russia After the War (1857) and My First Travels (1859).

They were related to the Piscataway, the dominant nation north of the Potomac. The settlers who arrived to found the English colony of Maryland purchased land for their first settlement from the Yaocomico. By the late 17th century, the tribe had disappeared from the historical record. Historians believe this was mostly due to epidemics of newly introduced infectious disease and to pressure from European settlers and other Native groups. Description and history The Yaocomaco were one of the Algonquian-speaking groups, who lived mostly in the coastal tidewater areas of present-day Maryland. The Piscataway were dominant to the north of the Potomac River, but there were many smaller tribes such as the Yaocomaco. Maryland also had Iroquoian-speaking tribes, particularly the Susquehannock along the Susquehanna River, who had been raiding into Algonquian territory. There were also Siouan-speaking tribes to the west and southwest. According to historical tradition, the first settlers of the Maryland colony purchased the land for their settlement at St. Mary's City from the Yaocomico, who had a settlement in the area. In 1634, Leonard Calvert, the first governor of the Maryland colony, met the Yaocomico along the Potomac below the island the Europeans had named St. Clement's Island. Yaocomico is referred to in different sources as either the name of the natives living in the area or as the name of the leader of the village. It was a tribe. The colonists had previously encountered and traded with Natives further upriver and so had some experience with them. As a result of the meeting, the Yaocomico traded approximately of land for a variety of European-made metal tools and cloth. Apparently the Yaocomico were willing to relocate from this village, and it was an ideal place for European settlement, as it had already been cleared. Father Andrew White, a Jesuit missionary priest and early Maryland settler, described the Yaocomico in detail. They dressed in deerskin decorated with natural objects such as shells, animal teeth, and feathers. Their bodies were painted in different colors. They drew red and blue lines on their faces. The women wore tattoos on various parts of the body, and used manmade beads to adorn their bodies and clothing. White claimed the Yaocomico were such skilled archers that they could throw a stick in the air and hit it with an arrow before it hit the ground. The Yaocomico had a loose structure of government and generally peaceful relations with other Algonquin groups. They cultivated the staple crops of the woodland natives, varieties of corn, beans, and squash. In addition, they gathered foods, fished and hunted in the rich coastal environment. The first European settlers described a number of Native celebrations throughout the year, often involving feasting and music. Their instruments were made from readily available materials and included rattles, drums, and flutes. European accounts claimed the Yaocomico were ready to sell the land to the Maryland colonists because they were being threatened by Iroquoian-speaking tribes from the north, specifically the Susquehannock and Seneca, the latter part of the Iroquois Confederacy. Despite relations with the Piscataway and the larger Powhatan Confederacy to the south, the Yaocomico had apparently decided to abandon the area before the arrival of Europeans. Both the Yaocomico and their neighbors had been raided repeatedly by groups of Susquehannock warriors based further up the Chesapeake, along what the settlers named the Susquehanna River. Such raids had pushed most Algonquian Natives out of the lands along the upper Chesapeake Bay, concentrating them in the south, where they encountered English settlers. The Yaocomico sought to use the new settlers as buffers against the Susquehannock. About half the Yaocomico left the site of St. Mary's City immediately. The other half left after a year, to allow them to maintain and harvest their crops. In the interim, the Yaocomico proved an invaluable resource to the settlers, teaching them how to survive in the new world. The Europeans, in return, wrote favorably of the Yaocomico. Jesuit priests arriving with the first colonists attempted to convert the Natives to Catholicism. They also continued to trade or share some European goods with the natives. The Maryland settlers continued to maintain good relations with the Yaocomico through the next few decades. They included provisions to protect them in treaties with neighboring tribes. But, the Yaocomico disappeared by the 1670s or 1680s. Historians now believe that Eurasian infectious diseases carried by the English were the most likely cause. The Natives had no immunity to such diseases, by then endemic among European populations. There was also continuing encroachment and competition by settlers or other native groups. Modern St. Mary's City includes a mock-up of the original Yaocomico village. The village shows Algonquian-style longhouses as they would have appeared to the first European settlers.

She was the artist and often the writer of the comic strips Nina's Adventures and Fluff, but most of her recent work has been in animation. She is perhaps best known for creating the animated feature film Sita Sings the Blues, based on the Ramayana, with parallels to her personal life. In 2018, she completed her second animated feature, Seder-Masochism, a retelling of the Book of Exodus as patriarchy emerging from goddess worship. Paley distributes much of her work, including Nina’s Adventures, Fluff, and all the original work in Sita Sings The Blues, under a copyleft license.  Early life  Paley was born in Urbana, Illinois, the daughter of Jean (Passovoy) and Hiram Paley. Her family was Jewish. Her father was a mathematics professor at the University of Illinois and was mayor of Urbana for a term in the early 1970s. She attended local elementary and high schools, graduating from University High School in 1986. She illustrated a \\"History of the North Pole\\" comic in collaboration with University High School history teacher Chris Butler, and attended the University of Illinois, studying art for two years before dropping out. While in college, her comic \\"Joyride\\" ran in The Daily Illini newspaper.  Nina's Adventures and other work  The Hots strip In 1988, Paley moved to Santa Cruz, California, and began to write and draw the strip Nina's Adventures. In 1991, she illustrated The Santa Cruz Haggadah and moved to San Francisco. In 2002, she wrote and directed Fetch!, a humorous short cartoon feature based on a variety of optical illusions, which has enjoyed popularity ever since. Beginning in 2002, Paley focused her work on the controversial subject of population growth. The most notable entry she produced on this subject was The Stork, in which the natural environment is bombed to destruction by storks dropping bundled babies. The film is a compact expression of the conflict between the increasing human population and the ecosystem in which it must live. The 3½ minute film was a considerable success at festivals and resulted in an invitation to the Sundance Film Festival. During this period of this time, Paley also contributed several comic strips for the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, of which she is a member and occasional spokesperson. Her work for the group still remains on their official website. In 2012, Paley posted an animation to Vimeo titled This Land Is Mine depicting the Middle East conflicts over history; it was named a Staff Pick. Between projects, Paley has worked as a freelance director at Duck Studios in Los Angeles. She has also taught in the Design and Technology section of Parsons, part of The New School.  Feature films  As of 2018, Paley has created two animated feature films. =Sita Sings the Blues= Sita Sings the Blues (full film) In 2002, Paley moved to Trivandrum, India, where her husband had taken a job. While she was visiting New York City on business concerning her third comic strip, The Hots, her husband terminated their marriage. Unable to return to either Trivandrum or San Francisco, she moved to Brooklyn, New York. Her personal crisis caused her to see more deeply into the Ramayana, the Indian epic, which she had encountered in India, and motivated her to produce a short animation which combines an episode from the Ramayana with a torch song recorded in 1929 by Annette Hanshaw, \\"Mean To Me\\". Paley later added episodes and other material to the work, which is now called Sita Sings the Blues. Many of the episodes appeared in animation festivals. She expanded it into a feature-length treatment of the Ramayana focused on Rama's wife, Sita, using a variety of animation styles and techniques. The finished work premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 11, 2008 and had its North American premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 25, 2008. The film was screened at more than 150 film festivals globally and was broadcast on PBS in New York City. For her work on Sita Sings the Blues, Paley was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award and garnered more than 35 international awards, including the top award at Annecy in 2008. The New York Times review of Sita described it as \\"ambitious and visually loaded\\" and the film was named a NYT Critic's Pick. =Seder-Masochism= The musical number \\"This Land Is Mine\\" from Seder-Masochism In 2011 she began work on a project called Seder-Masochism, an animated film about The Exodus, showing the rise of patriarchy and the fall of goddess worship. Early support was obtained for the project through a crowd-funding campaign on Kickstarter. In June 2018, after she had worked sporadically on the film for six years, Seder-Masochism premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France. Reviewers compared Paley's style to Monty Python, and praised the film's irreverent humor. In Poland, the film was screened at the ANIMATOR film festival where it was chosen by the audience as the festival's best feature- length animated film. Prior to the theatrical release of the film, Paley uploaded selected scenes for viewing on YouTube and Vimeo. The scene \\"This Land Is Mine\\" was first posted in 2012, and by 2014 had received 10 million views.  Free culture activism  'Copying is Not Theft' by Paley \\"Copying is not theft!\\" badge by Paley Because of obstacles in clearing the rights to Hanshaw's recordings for the Sita Sings the Blues, Paley took active part in the free culture movement. Since 2009 she is an artist-in-residence at the non-profit organization QuestionCopyright.org, which includes running the projects \\"Minute Memes\\" and the \\"Sita Distribution Project\\". \\"Minute Memes\\" is a series of short (\\"one-minute\\") video \\"memes\\" made by Paley about copyright restrictions and artistic freedom. She wrote and performed the song \\"Copying Isn't Theft\\" meant to be freely remixed by other people, with the animated clip issued as Minute Meme #1. Subsequent animations in this series are \\"All Creative Work Is Derivative\\", EFF Tribute and \\"Credit is Due: The Attribution Song\\". She also wrote \\"Understanding Free Content\\", an illustrated guide to the idea of free content. In 2010 she started a new comic strip Mimi & Eunice, highlighting intellectual property problems and paradoxes. She has published much of her work, including Nina’s Adventures, Fluff, and all original work in Sita Sings The Blues, under a copyleft licence. The website for Sita Sings the Blues includes a wiki where its fans contributed translated subtitles for the DVD of the film.See its lists of subtitles and screenings Paley won a Public Knowledge IP3 award in 2010 \\"for her work in intellectual property\\". Personal life Though of Jewish ancestry, Paley is an atheist as was her father. Paley is openly childfree. Paley describes herself as gender critical and writes often about the topic on her blog and social media.https://blog.ninapaley.com/category/terfy/ A showing of Seder-Masochism was protested by trans rights activists in Champaign, Illinois due to her online comments. She was a signatory to an open letter published by The Sunday Times defending J.K. Rowling against criticism for alleged transphobia. In 2011, she began making art quilts. The first public exhibition of her quilts was held in June 2013 in central Illinois.

The species is sometimes placed in the genus Aceros. The knobbed hornbill is the faunal symbol of South Sulawesi province.  Description  This is a large black hornbill with a yellow bill, white tail feathers, pale blue skin around eye, blackish feet and bare dark blue throat. The male has rufous/buff face and neck, orange-red eyes, and a high red casque on the top of his bill. The female has a black face and neck, a yellow casque, and brownish eyes.  Distribution and habitat  An Indonesian endemic, the knobbed hornbill is found in Sulawesi, Buton, Lembeh, Togian and Muna Island. It inhabits evergreen forest at an elevation of up to 1,800 m and also makes use of secondary forest, woodland and plantations for foraging. Male  Ecology  As with other hornbills, the knobbed hornbill is believed to be monogamous. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, but it will also take insects and small vertebrates. Breeding season spans 27–30 weeks and appears to be triggered by a dramatic reduction in rainfall. The female seals itself inside a tree hole for egg-laying using its own feces. During this time, the male will provide foods for the female and the young through a slit in the seal. Knobbed hornbills are important seed dispersers in their habitat and influence the initial fate of seeds of several tropical forest tree species.  Conservation  The species is currently classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. Despite being locally very common, they are threatened by habitat destruction from logging (since they depend on large and mature trees for breeding) and to some extent by hunting.

(genealogy and origin data on pp. 2622–2623) Swimming career Radmilovic made his debut for the Wales national water polo team at the age of 15 in 1901 and at the time was the youngest international player in the history of the sport. He competed in international swimming and water polo for nearly 30 years and was still an active swimmer well into his seventies. He was also a competent golfer and footballer.Vlašić, Tonči (4 January 2008) Hvala Britanci, za nas ste izmislili vaterpolo. slobodnadalmacija.hr. He won his first Amateur Swimming Association title in 1907 when victorious in the open water 5 mile race in the River Thames. His noted versatility came to the fore two years later when he won the 100 yards freestyle. He won the English Long Distance Championships in 1907 and 1925, the latter at age 39. A year later, he won the English One Mile Championship at age 40.

Olympic career His Olympic career began as a swimmer at the 1906 Intercalated Games where he finished 4th in 100 metres freestyle and 5th in the 400 metres event. In the 1 mile event he did not finish.Paul Radmilovic. Sports-Reference.com In 1908 he won a gold medal as part of the British water polo team that defeated Belgium 9–2 in the final. Radmilovic scored twice in the final. Two days later he was drafted into the 4×200 metre relay squad when another swimmer withdrew due to illness and swam the second leg of a dramatic race. Hungary appeared to be cruising to victory when anchor leg swimmer Zoltán Halmay began to lose consciousness in the water. Halmay struggled to the finish but Henry Taylor had touched four seconds earlier to give the British victory. Radmilovic also competed in three individual freestyle events but failed to make a final. Radmilovic moved to Weston-super-Mare in 1904 and all Olympic successes were gained whilst a resident of this Somerset resort and where he was an ardent member of the local swimming and water polo clubs. He won his third career gold as part of the British water polo team at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. The Austrians were defeated 8–0 in the final. Radmilovic's fourth and final gold came at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp albeit in eventful circumstances. Great Britain and Belgium had impressed in reaching the final and the game itself was a tight one decided when Radmilovic scored to put the British 3–2 ahead. On the final whistle incensed Belgian spectators attempted to attack the British players. Armed police guarded the team as they left the pool. He competed as a member of the British team in both the 1924 and 1928 Olympic water polo tournaments without medal success. He was 42 years old when his Olympic career ended. His record of four gold medals was unrivalled by any British Olympian until Sir Steve Redgrave equalled and eventually broke it by winning his fifth title in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney If one includes the 1906 Intercalated Games, he competed at six Olympic Games. It would only be in 1976 when another athlete, fencer Bill Hoskyns, would compete at six Games for Great Britain. Radmilovic is the first athlete to compete in water polo at five Olympics, and one of ten male players who won three Olympic gold medals in water polo. Post-Olympics He ran the Imperial Hotel in Weston- super-Mare, England for many years, and was still swimming 400 m a day at age seventy-eight. In 1967, he was inducted in the International Swimming Hall of Fame. He was the second water polo player (after American Wallace O'Connor) and the third Briton (after coach Matthew Mann and English Channel swimmer Captain Matthew Webb) to be inducted. Radmilovic died in Weston-super-Mare, England, in 1968 and is buried in Weston Cemetery on Milton Road. His son took over the running of the hotel and continued to display his father's vast trophy collection. Legacy He was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame in 1993. To celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of his 1908 double- gold Olympic performance, a plaque was placed on the Cardiff International Pool to honour him, paid for by the 2012 London Olympics Committee and the Welsh Assembly.

The publisher, Jacob Tonson, had solicited poems from Pope for the volume three years before; but publication was delayed and finally occurred three weeks before Pope's 21st birthday. Pope did not visit London at the time of publication, instead travelling there in June. Tonson was a hard bargainer, and paid Pope 13 guineas, for the young man's verses (about two pence per line). Pope would eventually become a hard bargainer himself in dealing with publishers, and although he became good friends with Tonson, he hardly ever wrote for him again. Pope's January and May; Or, The Merchant's Tale, a story about a young wife and the old husband she cuckolds (on pages 172-224) retold part of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (lines 817-720 of Pope's version): :Thus ends our Tale, whose Moral next to make, :Let all wise Husbands hence Example take; :And pray, to crown the Pleasure of their Lives, :To be so well deluded by their Wives. The poet also contributed a translation, The Episode of Sarpedon, Translated from the Twelfth and Sixteenth Books of Homer's Iliads (pages 301-323). John Denham, a poet of Dryden's generation, had written the best-known translation of Sarpedon's speech. According to the 20th-century critic and Pope biographer Maynard Mack, Pope's version shined in comparison, and when both versions were weighed together, \\"the coffee-house critics must have sensed [...] that a new star of some magnitude was rising in their sky\\". But the four Pastorals (pages 721-751) which concluded the volume, would have been the works on which Pope pinned most of his hopes for recognition, according to Mack, because the genre was what Virgil and various Renaissance critics deemed a proper first test for an aspiring poet. On May 17, Pope's friend, Wycherley, wrote to him that \\"all the best Judges [...] like your part of the Book so well, that the rest is lik'd the worse\\". Pope wrote back three days later, referring to Tonson's low payments but valuable publicizing (by including him in what the title page of the anthology called \\"Eminent hands\\"): :I can be content with a bare saving [that is, neither winning nor losing] game, without being thought an Eminent hand, (with which Title Jacob has graciously dignify'd his adventurers and voluntiers in Poetry). Jacob creates Poets, as Kings sometimes do Knights, not for their honour, but for money.

It is located in La Cañada Flintridge, California, on a campus near the San Gabriel Mountains. The school serves both as a day school and a boarding school, with 12% of the student population living on campus. Campus An aerial view of the FSHA campus, from the Student Activities Center and Crane Field on the right to the Administration Building and convent on the left. =Hotel= FSHA’s 41-acre campus was originally the site of the Flintridge Hotel, which was designed and built by architect Myron Hunt in 1926 atop the San Rafael Hills, at the direction of Frank Putnam Flint, a United States senator from what was then called La Cañada. Flint owned the land on which the hotel was built and commissioned Hunt, due to his expertise in designing in the Mediterranean Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival architecture styles. The Flintridge Hotel, soon acquired by Bowman-Biltmore Hotels, was then renamed the Flintridge Biltmore Hotel. It included a large main building with a dining room, lounge and patio, in addition to six smaller cottages meant to house whole families. The grounds also included a pool, tennis courts, golf course, archery range and several large lawn areas. The business failed as the Great Depression continued, and the hotel was closed and sold in 1931. =School= After the Dominican Sisters of Mission San Jose took over the property in 1931, the hotel was converted into a school exclusively for boarding students in grades 1-12. The billiards and game room became a chapel, the hotel's beauty salon became the head administrator's office, the bridal suite became a community room for the Sisters, and the Green Room (formerly a ballroom) was converted into a recreational room for students. The main dining room, with wood paneling and chandeliers, is virtually unchanged from 1927 and still used by both boarding students and the Sisters. Senator Flint originally owned many of the furnishings and decorations that remain in the original hotel building. In the school's early days, all students were boarders and classes were taught in the hotel building; the cottages were used as dorms. Beginning in 1945, a decision was made to begin saving money to build a new structure for classrooms. In 1950, the decision was made to build a new high school building, which cost $210,000 and was completed in 1951. The Class of 1952 became the first senior class to occupy the new high school building. The building had three state-of-the-art science laboratories, a new library and spacious classrooms. In November 1955, the Sisters voted to borrow $100,000 to build an auditorium. The academic year of 1956-57 marked the first year the student body was able to utilize this new auditorium. This new building allowed for expanded performances of plays on a stage instead of the lounge. The old elementary school building on Palmerstone Drive, formerly servants' quarters for hotel employees, was later sold as a private residence. The area known as the Octagon, which was located between the pool and pedestrian bridge, once served as a music conservatory. A fire in 1971 damaged the building so severely that it was torn down. Today, the only parts of the old Flintridge Biltmore hotel in use for student instruction are an art studio in the Annex of the old hotel and the upper part of Cottage 4, which houses music instruction. Due to the greater needs of the school, Flintridge Sacred Heart was able to expand its science and athletics facilities in 1998. A new 26,000-square-foot (2,400 m2) Student Activities Center opened on campus, which houses three state-of-the-art science classrooms with labs, a gymnasium, aerobics room, exercise room, training room, multipurpose athletic field and amphitheater. With the completion of the Student Activities Center in 1998, the science laboratories in the high school building were transformed into regular classrooms. The cottages now house school services such as admissions, technology and development. The campus of Flintridge Sacred Heart is transected by the Pasadena—La Cañada Flintridge border, with the Glendale border less than a mile away. The school’s street and mailing address remain in La Cañada Flintridge. The area is commonly known within the FSHA community as “the Hill” – the campus sits atop the crest of the San Rafael Hills. History The main structure of the Flintridge Hotel, later the Flintridge Biltmore, shortly after its opening in 1927. This building now serves as the main Administration Building at Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy and houses the Dominican Sisters and boarding students. Senator Flint opened the Flintridge Hotel on December 14, 1927. He soon sold the unprofitable hotel to the Biltmore hotel chain, which reopened the property on December 20, 1928. Yet with less than a dozen guests at any one time, and compounded by the Great Depression, the Flintridge Hotel never succeeded as a resort. When the economy dramatically declined in 1929 and following years, the hotel could not survive. Bankruptcy was declared and the buildings were vacant for almost two years. At the same time, the Dominican Sisters of Mission San José were planning to build a convent and boarding school in Pasadena and heard about the Flintridge Hotel property. Archbishop James Cantwell contacted Mother Dolorosa at the Sacred Heart Convent in Los Angeles. Mother Dolorosa requested the support of the Motherhouse at Mission San José and permission to pursue what she felt was “a perfect site for a boarding school.” The asking price for the entire resort was $150,000, but the Prioress General’s answer was initially negative. Undeterred by this response, Mother Dolorosa and Sister Thomasina went back to “The Hilltops” and waited to show the Prioress General, Mother Seraphina Mertz, the former hotel. The Prioress General saw the hotel, but turned down the offer. Mother Dolorosa was still determined and so returned to the Motherhouse where she persuaded Mother Seraphina to “come and see the property” a second time. Both traveled south to Los Angeles to visit the site and finally agreed on a decision. With the approval of Mother Seraphina and her Council, Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy Corporation was established on July 24, 1931. The officers were elected and the first order of business was the decision to take out a loan from the Security First National Bank of Los Angeles in the amount of $150,000 to purchase the entire hotel, six outlying guest cottages and 54 acres (220,000 m2). The deed was signed at the Motherhouse on St. Dominic’s Day, August 4, 1931. On Saturday, August 15, 1931, the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Dominican Sisters, headed by Mother Dolorosa, foundress and first superior of Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy; Sister M. Frances, pioneer and first principal; and Sister Thomasina took permanent possession of their new home. Legend has it that the women’s car broke down on the drive up to the property, so they walked the rest of the way in their heavy wool habits carrying only a $5 bill and a statue of Mary. The next day, after Holy Mass, a breakfast was served for the almost 2,000 people who came to visit the site. Many of the visitors were parents who registered their daughters. September 2 marked the first day of classes for 200 students in grades 1 through 12 under the direction of the Sisters, along with many new teachers. The school was exclusively for boarders until after the new high school building was constructed in 1951. At about the same time, the school began to phase out the elementary grades, and the elementary school was closed in 1963. After surviving a decline in enrollment caused by the turbulent social atmosphere of the late 1960s and 1970s, the Flintridge Sacred Heart student body began to grow to its current population of approximately 400.

It is one of the oldest and largest active food co-ops in the United States. As a food cooperative, one of its goals is to be a \\"buying agent to its members, not a selling agent to any industry.\\" Non-members are welcome to visit the store, but may not shop. Formed in 1973, PSFC has grown to include over 17,000 members. The PSFC business model requires each of its adult members to contribute 2 hours and 45 minutes of work every four weeks, and that no member share a household with a non-member. In exchange, active members may shop at the store. The store sells a variety of foods and household goods, some environmentally friendly products, at a 21% markup over the wholesale price (compared to 26-100% at a supermarket). The savings are possible because labor is contributed by its members. PSFC operates as a New York state cooperative corporation. Governance and management PSFC, a cooperative corporation formed under the laws of the State of New York, is run by a Board of Directors consisting of five persons elected to staggered three-year terms by and from the membership. The longest-serving General Coordinator present at the meeting (usually Joe Holtz) serves as a voting member ex officio.PSFC Bylaws, as amended March 27, 2001, Article III, Sections 1 and 2. The Board of Directors gather monthly to hear the advice of the members at the General Meeting (GM),PSFC Bylaws, as amended March 27, 2001, Article VI, Section 2. and generally approve all resolutions passed by the GM. The GM agenda is governed by an Agenda Committee, and the meeting itself is run by a Chair Committee, whose members rotate in service as chairperson and collectively serve as GM parliamentarian. The day-to-day operations of the PSFC are run by paid employees called coordinators. The senior-ranking coordinators, called General Coordinators, are hired by the General Meeting and approved by the Board of Directors.PSFC Bylaws, as amended March 27, 2001, Article V, Section 1. The coop has a Diversity and Equality Committee, whose members receive workslot credit and which proposes programs to enhance membership diversity at the coop. History The PSFC was founded in 1973. The organization initially sub- leased space with the Mongoose Community Center. By 1977 the Mongoose was defunct and the Coop started renting directly from the landlord.\\"Union Street Memories,\\" Linewaiters' Gazette, November 3, 2011 In 1978, the Coop began renting 782 Union Street with an option to buy upon the expiration of a two- year lease. Expecting to buy, the Coop completed renovations the next year and purchased the building in 1980. This was followed in 1988 and 1999 with the purchase of the two buildings immediately to the west, with renovations completed in 1991 and 2001 respectively. In December 2009, the Coop paid the remaining $707,000 on the mortgage for all three buildings. This pre-payment was made without penalty, as the mortgage holder, National Cooperative Bank, needed assistance after the banking crisis of 2008–2009. =Political and environmental action= The coop has a long history of political action. During the apartheid regime, goods from South Africa were banned; during the Pinochet regime, Chilean grapes were removed; Nestlé products were banned because of the company's campaign to promote infant formula instead of breastfeeding. Coop policy dictates that existing boycotts are discontinued unless renewed annually. Since 2004, the PSFC has boycotted Coca-Cola products (including Minute Maid and Odwalla), citing the company's labor practices and exploitation of natural resources in third-world countries. Since 2010, the PSFC has boycotted Flaum Appetizing Products for violations of labor law. Flaum is a local kosher producer known for hummus sold under its \\"Mike & Joe's\\" label. In 2008, the PSFC General Meeting resolved that the coop would discontinue selling bottled water and stop providing plastic shopping bags at checkout. The Coop collects a variety of hard-to-recycle plastic packaging for upcycling. This recycling initiative started with the collecting of yogurt cups to be upcycled into toothbrushes and other personal care goods by Recycline in 2008, at a time when New York City's municipal recycling limited the types of plastic accepted. With changes in NYC's trash recycling policies, the Park Slope Food Coop put together the hard-to-recycle plastics collection currently in place with Terracycle for single serve baby food pouches, plastic cling wrap, produce bags, toothbrushes, toothpaste tubes, and water filters.http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/non-recyclable- plastics.shtml In 2009, The Jewish Daily ForwardGersten, Lana. Food Fight: Brooklyn Co-op Mulls Israel Ban. The Jewish Daily Forward. 18 Feb. 2009. incorrectly stated or implied that the coop was considering a ban on Israeli products in protest of the 2009 Israeli military offensive in Gaza. In actuality, no such proposal had been placed on the agenda of the PSFC General Meeting (GM).Kuntzman, Gersh. The Food Co-op is not — repeat not — considering a ban on Israeli products. The Brooklyn Paper. The stories were based on two letters-to-the-editor in the February 12, 2009 edition of the PSFC's Linewaiters' Gazette. (see page 11). The Gazette publishes member submissions regardless of opinion. For three years members of the coop expressed their opinions in the Gazette regarding a potential boycott of Israel, and the July 26, 2011, General Meeting discussed holding a coop-wide referendum on joining the BDS movement, with no action taken. The March 27, 2012 GM, which was held at Brooklyn Technical High School due to an unprecedented turnout of nearly 1,700 members (eleven times more than typical), after a heated discussion considered and rejected a proposal to hold such a referendum. In 2010, in response to an announcement by the menswear retailer Barneys New York that they would be opening a location in Brooklyn called Barneys Coop, the PSFC General Meeting (GM) considered taking action in light of the company's apparent violation of New York's Cooperative Corporations Law, which restricts the use of the term \\"coop\\" to cooperative businesses. The general coordinators informed the state attorney general of the violation and presented a plan for a lawsuit to the July 2010 GM, which rejected the proposal for anticipated costs. A more limited proposal was approved by the August 2010 GM but later overturned on procedural grounds. On January 26, 2016, the Park Slope Food Coop voted in a change to The Rules For The General Meeting. It stipulated that in order to pass any boycott, a super-majority of at least 75% of the General Meeting must agree to the boycott. =Unionization efforts= In the summer of 2018 a group of paid staff at the Park Slope Food Coop started unionizing efforts with the help of RWDSU, an union representing grocery store employees and other food chain workers. Among the issues raised are job security (an end to \\"at-will employment\\"), unequal treatment in the work place (racism and other forms of discrimination) and a desire to better align the Coop with international cooperative principles and values of democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity. On April 23, 2019 several employees filed charges of unfair labor practices with the National Labor Relations Board. The complaint includes allegations of harassment, coercive statements and interrogation. Given the alleged unlawful interference in the unionization process by management, the General Coordinators of the Coop have agreed to guarantee non-interference in the unionization efforts, this has been disputed by union organizers and has been one of the issues that led to the NLRB complaint. The Park Slope Food Coop's Labor Committee, a group founded to provide \\"leadership and information on the labor issues that impact the coop’s food system,\\" voiced their support of a neutrality agreement. The NLRB settled with the Coop regarding the Unfair Labor Practice charges, as a result the Park Slope Food Coop was required to post a notice to employees stating that going forward specified labor rights will not be violated. =Criticism= PSFC's work shift requirement, which includes every adult member of a household having to partake, has inspired criticism over the years. In 2011, The New York Times also reported allegations in February 2011 that some members were asking their nannies to cover their work shifts. Membership In order to join the co-op, new members must attend an orientation and sign up for a monthly 2h 45min volunteer shift. The volunteer positions fall into the following categories: food processing, inventory, maintenance, office, receiving & stocking, second floor service desk, shopping, soup kitchen prep, and soup kitchen at CHiPS (a local charity organization). All slots other than the last two directly relate to the daily operation of the co-op. After shift assignment, new members have a month to pay their one-time membership fee (regular: $25 or low-income reduced rate: $5) and eight weeks to pay their membership investment deposit (regular: $100 or low-income reduced rate: $10) which will be returned if they decide leave the co-op. Members must show up and work their volunteer shifts once a month, but if they cannot make their usual shift they have the option to swap shifts with another member. If a member misses their shift, they must complete two make-up shifts before their next shift. The strictness of this policy has been criticized as unfair to single mothers, members with multiple outside jobs, and students, since an excess of required make-up shifts requires significant working hours that may be unmanageable without external support. Unpaid membership fees or unmet shifts lead to a status of \\"Alert,\\" and then ultimately \\"Suspended,\\" which prevent a member from entering and shopping at the co-op. Senior members older than 70 are eligible 'retire' from their volunteer duties. Chronically ill members and anyone under 18 is also not required to work. Temporary injuries and sickness can be taken into account to excuse volunteer duties. On Monday, March 23 2020, for the first time in their history, the co-op suspended their member work requirement in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection to paid staff. Until further notice, the co-op would be operated purely by existing and temporary paid workers.

He plays multiple instruments. He is a composer, programmer and producer; and is most often associated primarily for his work as a jazz percussionist. Biography Cinelu was born in Saint-Cloud, Hauts-de-Seine. His father is from Martinique and his mother is French. He was involved with music from childhood as his father and two brothers were musicians, and started spending time and playing in various concert halls such as the Chapelle des Lombards in the suburbs of Paris. He became interested in various styles of music such as jazz, rock, salsa and even in more esoteric varieties like Egyptian chants and Romani music. He would later expand his repertoire to include fado, flamenco, African music, Japanese music, and Slavic music.Souvenirs d'un homme de mains, article take from Jazz Magazine, September 2007. A portion of the biography is sourced from an article in Jazz Magazine. The first instrument that Cinelu took to was the bongo drums, which led him to decide to try and live from his music. He often played the bongos in the streets where he first experimented with improvisation. At the end of the 1970s he became more and more interested in the French jazz fusion scene where he made many connections with other musicians and members of the music industry. At varying times he worked with Jef Gilson, Chute Libre, and Moravagine. Shortly thereafter he began playing with artists such as Bernard Lavilliers, Colette Magny, Gong, and Toto Bissainthe. In 1979 he moved to New York City. After a difficult start he met several musicians living in and around the city such as George Benson, Wayne Shorter, Kenny Barron, and Cassandra Wilson. He continued to learn new instruments in different contexts; for example he played the bass in a gospel choir and earned some money by giving drum lessons. In the beginning of the 1980s he met Miles Davis while playing in a soul band at the New York club Mikkel's. Miles offered him a job as percussionist in his group, playing alongside the group's drummer Al Foster. After a month of rehearsals, Cinelu went on tour with Miles Davis' band. His stint with Miles Davis led to more recognition; during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, Joe Zawinul contacted him to join Weather Report as percussionist, which he accepted. During this period he began composing music, with the help of Weather Report members Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul. Cinelu also played with Michel Portal after Michel saw him play at the Théâtre du Châtelet with Miles Davis. Starting in the 1990s Cinelu began working on a solo career. His first solo album self-titled Mino Cinelu was released in 2000. Next came Quest Journey, on which Cinelu collaborated with guitarists Bill Frisell and Gerry Leonard, keyboardist Don Blackman, bassist Leo Traversa, DJs DJ Logic and , singer Toni Smith, and rapper Da Lioness.

On the evening of 18 September 1992 he was walking down Memorial Drive by Hayden Library when he and his companion were attacked by three students of Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School. Shon McHugh (aged 15), Joseph D. Donovan (aged 17), and Alfredo Velez (aged 18) robbed Raustein and his companion of $33, and McHugh stabbed Raustein, causing fatal injuries. MIT President Charles M. Vest issued a statement the next day. A memorial service for Raustein was held on 9 October 1992. Raustein's murder was the first of an MIT student for over a decade and sparked a Town and gown debate centering on the tension between the wealthy universities in Cambridge, MIT and Harvard University, and the poorer permanent Cambridge population. A vigil held the week after his death drew representatives from both communities. A permanent memorial award, the Yngve Raustein Award for Scholarship, Teamwork and Community, was established at MIT in 1993. Raustein has been memorialized in the Garden of Peace memorial in Boston, Massachusetts. McHugh was tried as a juvenile, and was released from prison after less than 11 years. Velez testified against Donovan and was sentenced to less than 10 years in prison. Donovan was charged with felony murder and was sentenced to life without parole. Donovan (aged 33) in 2009 appealed against his sentence of life without parole for felony murder on the grounds that, although he punched Raustein, he had no knowledge of a knife or planned robbery. Raustein's family have said that \\"the life without parole sentence was way too harsh\\". The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declined an appeal in 1996. In 2014, the Massachusetts Parole Board decided he should be released following six months in a rehabilitative program and one year in a lower level security prison.

In 2015 they performed at only 98 venues. However, they toured Australia and New Zealand in March, then picked up their usual pace until December. Their traditional Halloween video was Bohemian Rhapsody, done in the style of Queen. =Nonesuch Records= Lake Street Dive signed with Nonesuch Records in 2015 and released Side Pony in February 2016 with their new label.Nonesuch Journal, 12 Nov 2015 Nonesuch Journal The album's name refers to a hairstyle adopted by Kearney and is slang for \\"unexpectedly diverting the mind's attention\\". The band made 183 appearances in 2017 and 2018, including tours through North America, Europe, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. The band released their second album with Nonesuch, Free Yourself Up in May 2018. Kearney says, \\"This album is based in the realities in our time which have inevitably become part of everyone's daily life. It's something you think about and obsess over—and write songs about. Free Yourself Up is about empowering yourself, emboldening yourself, no matter what's going wrong.\\" In November 2018, they released Freak Yourself Out, a five-song EP of songs written but not recorded for Free Yourself Up.  Influences  All the band members were singing and/or playing musical instruments by the time they were in third grade. Most had some classical music training growing up and their parents were musicians. In their own way, had migrated to jazz by the time they met. However, the band says they were influenced by the music their parents were playing at home. This ranged from classic jazz to '60s soul to rock and roll. The band members profess to love the entire Beatles discography. Kearney wrote \\"Hello? Goodbye!\\" and the band plays \\"Don't Make Me Hold Your Hand\\", both referencing Beatles tunes. Olson says he was inspired by Paul McCartney's love/vice lyrical concept in \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" when he wrote \\"You Go Down Smooth.\\" The band's traditional Halloween specials and covers on the EP release Fun Machine give an idea of the genres that influence them. These range from songs by the Mamas and the Papas, ABBA, the Drifters, Fleetwood Mac, Hall & Oates, Jackson 5 and Paul McCartney. The band has been influenced by classic pop and swing era jazz. \\"We want it to sound like the Beatles and Motown had a party together,\\" says drummer Mike Calabrese. Critics describe their music as \\"Sounds Like: Llewyn Davis's favorite pop group; Motown meets the Brill Building in jazzy, soulful, woulda- been Sixties chart toppers.\\" Price has said that the band's performances are influenced by the audience in front of them. \\"We are translating [crowd energy] on stage, trying to figure out what kind of energy to put out to the crowds. For the first time we feel we can mold the energy of a room.\\"http://publicradioeast.org/post/after-years-performing-lake-street-dive- reaps-sold-out-shows  Discography  * In this episode (2006) * Promises, Promises (2007) * Lake Street Dive (2010) * Live at the Lizard Lounge (Video) (2011) * Fun Machine (2012) * Bad Self Portraits (2014) * Side Pony (2016) * Free Yourself Up (2018)https://twitter.com/lakestreetdive/status/968632915851489280 * Freak Yourself Out (2018)http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/freak-yourself-out = Singles = *What I'm Doing Here / Wedding Band (2014) *Call Off Your Dogs (2016) – #24 Adult Alternative Songs *I Don't Care About You (2016) – #29 Adult Alternative Songs *Good Kisser (2018) – #12 Adult Alternative Songs *Shame, Shame, Shame (2018) – #24 Adult Alternative Songs *Making Do (2020)  Members  *Rachael Price – lead vocals, ukulele, guitar *Mike “McDuck” Olson – trumpet, guitar, organ, electric piano, synthesizer, vocals *Bridget Kearney – standup bass, electric bass, piano, vocals *Mike Calabrese – drums, organ, vocals *Akie Bermiss – keyboards and vocals References  External links  * * Playlist on WaveCat * Lake Street Dive Facebook * I Want You Back YouTube video Category:2004 establishments in Massachusetts Category:American pop music groups Category:Musical groups established in 2004 Category:Musical groups from Boston Category:New England Conservatory alumni Category:Nonesuch Records artists Category:Signature Sounds artists ","title":"Lake Street Dive"},{"id":"9454198","text":"The South Island oystercatcher or South Island pied oystercatcher (Haematopus finschi) is one of the two common oystercatchers found in New Zealand. Its name is often contracted to the acronym \\"SIPO\\" (rhyming with \\"typo\\"). Description The South Island oystercatcher is easily identifiable as a pied oystercatcher – a large wader with striking black and white plumage, long red-orange bill and red legs. It is distinguished from the pied morph of the variable oystercatcher by a white lower back, more white on the wing, and a demarcation line of black and white further forward on the breast, and from the pied oystercatcher of Australia by a longer bill and shorter legs, as well as the forward demarcation line of white on the back being pointed rather than square. It is 46 cm in length; its wingspan is 80–86 cm; it weighs 550 g.Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.; & Davies, J.N. (eds). (1994). Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds. Volume 2: Raptors to Lapwings. Oxford University Press: Melbourne. Distribution and habitat The South Island oystercatcher is endemic to New Zealand where it breeds inland on the South Island, after which most of the population moves to estuaries and harbours on the North Island. It has been recorded occasionally as a vagrant on Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island and the eastern coast of mainland Australia. Its breeding habitat comprises braided river systems, open paddocks and cultivated land, lake beaches, subalpine tundra and herbfields. Non- breeding habitat includes coastal estuaries, bays, beaches, sandflats and intertidal mudflats. Behaviour =Food= Unsurprisingly for an oystercatcher, it mostly feeds molluscs and worms. =Voice= It has piping calls, which are used socially and aggressively, as well as a piercing alarm call and a quiet flight call. =Breeding= It nests in sand scrapes on farmland or gravel banks in braided rivers. Its clutch typically consists of two, sometimes three, brown eggs, which are blotched dark and pale brown. Its incubation period is 24–28 days, with both sexes incubating. Its young are precocial and nidifugous, fledging 6 weeks after hatching. Conservation The population of this species declined, mainly because of hunting, during the late 19th century and early 20th century but, with legal protection since 1940, has since been increasing. In 2002 the total population was estimated to be 110,000. Its conservation status is of Least Concern.BirdLife International. (2006). Species factsheet: Haematopus finschi.

It has an approximately 16% market share of the New Zealand fixed telephone landline and residential broadband market.  History  Slingshot was founded in 1996 by Malcolm Dick and Annette Presley. The company was established as part of the CallPlus group of companies to provide residential customers with internet and toll calling services. There are 300+ employees who all work in Auckland CBD.  Activities  * 2013 – Launched New Slingshot \\"Global Mode\\", Free on all Slingshot Broadband connections * 2013 – Sponsored TV3's new flagship current affairs show \\"3rd Degree\\" * 2012 – Finalist at the World Forum Broadband Awards in Amsterdam, for Broadband Unlimited * 2012 – Launched Rollover Data for Free on all Broadband Connections * 2011 – Launched Unlimited Broadband at only $60 * 2011 – Free Wi-Fi for Auckland City and Rugby World Cup supporters * 2009 – Cited by NZ Herald Survey as New Zealand's Top Broadband Provider * 2007 – Best Internet Service Provider – People's Choice Awards * 2005 – TUANZ Broadband Innovation Award * 2002 – i4free legal battle victory On 22 February 2002 i4free/Slingshot filed a claim in the High Court of New Zealand against Telecom for $18 million in damages to the business, breach of contract and a breach of the Commerce Act sections 27 and 36. This claim originated from April 2000 when i4free won a High Court injunction to stop Telecom from acting to disconnect further i4free customers.  Slingshot Fibre (Ultra-Fast Broadband)  The New Zealand Government has undertaken an initiative which will see the delivery of Ultra-fast broadband using fibre optic cables to up to 75% of the population within a ten-year period The nationwide ultra-fast broadband network uses Fibre connectivity to provide download/upload speeds of up to 100Mbit/s/50Mbit/s for residential customers. Fibre will enable faster downloads and streaming - content including movies may be up to 50x the speed of regular broadband. Slingshot Fibre is currently being trialed with a number of customers and will be rolled out across New Zealand soon.  Products  * Homeline & Broadband Slingshot's core products are a range of Homeline and Broadband bundles. These may include various features such as Rollover Data, Global Mode and the option of 20 EasyPhone Features. * Broadband Unlimited In October 2011 Slingshot launched its Broadband Unlimited plan. This saw a large uptake amongst internet users. * Naked Broadband Naked Broadband allows Slingshot customers to have a Broadband connection at home without the need for a fixed Homeline. * Calling and Tolls Slingshot provides National, International and Landline to mobile calling rates with base calling plans that are available for both Slingshot Homeline customers, and customers that choose to use Slingshot only as a calling/ tolls provider. * Slingshot Mobile Slingshot mobile was started in 2009 as a challenger brand with a low cost point of difference. Originally Slingshot offered mobile services via a Mobile Virtual Network Operator service over Vodafone's network. * Mobile Broadband Slingshot's Mobile Broadband allows customers to access the internet while on the go. Slingshot provides customers with a Mobile Data Stick that allows complete access via a laptop while away from a network connection. The demand for mobile data in New Zealand has grown substantially. Consequently, the Mobile Data market is becoming more competitive in NZ with Slingshot's reducing rates reflect this increase in demand. This product has been discontinued.  Products & Services  * Rollover Data Slingshot was the largest ISP in New Zealand to introduce Rollover Data in October 2012 at no cost onto all of their broadband plans. Rollover Data allows Slingshot customers to keep their unused data every month (rolls-over into the next month) and it won't expire for a full year. * Un-metering online content On 4 April 2012, Slingshot was the first ISP in New Zealand to un- meter Quickflix content. This meant that customers streaming content via Quickflix.co.nz were not charged for the data usage on their Slingshot account. This was followed shortly afterwards by Slingshot un-metering all streaming content on iSKY and eventually IGLOO. This allowed customers to stream as much of the media catalogue from these providers without the concern of data usage. In June 2013, SKY TV made some network changes to improve the viewing experience for on-demand customers when video streaming. This change to how SKY TV hosts content in NZ meant that all internet providers in NZ (including Slingshot) were no longer able to un-meter content from iSKY or IGLOO. * Subscription TV – IGLOO On 17 April 2013, Slingshot launched a new product called the \\"IGLOO Home bundle\\". This further increased Slingshot \\"Whole of Household\\" product offering and provided customers with a full communications package. The IGLOO Home Bundle saw considerable success amongst NZ consumers looking to get away from the high-cost services of SKY Television. * Global Mode On 19 June 2013, Slingshot launched a free add-on to all of its Broadband plans called \\"Global Mode\\". Global Mode lets overseas visitors to New Zealand enjoy some of their favourite international web services from the convenience of a Slingshot Broadband connection. This is known as place-shifting. New Zealand has a rather tarnished reputation of being an \\"Internet Backwater\\" and Global Mode helps combat this by allowing visitors to continue accessing some of their favourite sites while in the country and on a Slingshot connection. Global Mode has received a significant amount of media attention since launch, with feature stories in the NZ Herald, TV3 News, NBR, Wall Street Journal and the BRW. In 2015, Global Mode ceased and Netflix and Hulu among other geo- blocked internet sites became geo-blocked again.  Market Position  Slingshot is the third largest ISP in New Zealand. As of 2015, it has 16% of the residential market.  Parent Company  Slingshot is a subsidiary of telecommunications company CallPlus. Callplus was founded in 1996. CallPlus continues today as the B2B arm of the organisation, providing Calling, Mobile, Broadband, VOIP and Fibre services to SME's across New Zealand. Slingshot was established in 2001 to provide residential solutions.  Senior Management  *CallPlus CEO – Mark Callander *Slingshot General Manager – Taryn Hamilton Criticism On 15 August 2008, Slingshot came under criticism from the public and the media about a problem with their web cache. The cache, set up to solve a known problem with YouTube, caused private information of customers to be shared among other customers. The error caused users logging into websites such as Gmail, Facebook, Bebo and TradeMe to be given access to the accounts of other Slingshot customers who were using those websites at the same time, instead of their own accounts. Similar incidents occurred with Slingshot in September 2007 and May 2008http://www.mediafetish.co.nz/2008/08/slingshot-update.html In December 2013 Slingshot was fined $NZ 250,000 after it admitted transferring competitors' customers to its business without authority. Slingshot pleaded guilty to 50 charges under the New Zealand Fair Trading Act in the Auckland District Court and admitted it had transferred 27 customers' accounts from other ISPs to Slingshot without the customers' authority.

It depicts a futuristic India in 2047, a century after its independence from Britain, characterized both by ancient traditions and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligences, robots and nanotechnology. The novel won the British Science Fiction Award in 2004 and was nominated for a Hugo. Plot introduction The novel follows a number of different characters' viewpoints on and around the date of 15 August 2047, the centenary of India's partition and independence from the colonial British Raj. This future India has become balkanized into a number of smaller competing states, such as Awadh, Bharat, and Bangla. The global information network is now inhabited by artificial intelligences, phonetically called aeais in the novel, of varying levels of intelligence. Aeais higher than level 2.5 (able to pass the Turing test and imitate humans) are banned, and their destruction (\\"excommunication\\") is the responsibility of \\"Krishna Cops\\", like Mr. Nandha. While some pockets of the subcontinent are still steeped in ancient tradition and values, mainstream culture is replete with aeais in TV entertainment and robotic swarms in defense. During such a time, Ranjit Ray steps down from his control of Ray Power, a key energy company, and the responsibility falls on his son Vishram Ray. The playboy Vishram is struggling to make it on his own as a stand-up comedian in Scotland when he is flown back to Varanasi to assume this role, for which he finds himself terribly ill-equipped but eventually surprisingly effective. He learns that his company is working on harvesting zero-point energy from other universes, and sees the particle collider built by his father with the help of Odeco, a clandestine investment firm. After a prolonged drought, a severe water shortage threatens to jeopardize the peace between the subcontinental states. To avert this crisis, governments are melting glaciers and modifying natural systems. To take advantage of the unrest, a Hindu fundamentalist leader named N.K Jeevanji organises a \\"rath yatra\\" on a spectacular juggernaut. He starts releasing key information to the press via Najia Askarzadah, an ambitious Swedish-Afghan reporter with a desire to be part of history as it is being made. Lisa Durnau notices an apocalyptic crisis brewing in Alterre, a simulated evolution of earth created by AI scientist Thomas Lull, who is currently hiding in a South Indian coastal village. While Lisa is sent into space to investigate an asteroid, Thomas Lull runs into Aj, a girl with mysterious powers that allow her to see into people's lives, pasts and futures. He decides to follow her and protect her during her quest to find her own true identity, but it is soon revealed that Aj's powers extend beyond mere mortals, when she brings a robot army to a halt with the raise of a hand. Tal is a beautiful nute (of neutral gender) involved in the designing team of India's greatest \\"soapi\\", Town & Country, some of the main stars of which are not human actors, but aeais. Tal falls prey to a conspiracy that compromises the career of Shaheen Badoor Khan, Private Secretary to the Prime Minister Sajida Rana, leading to her assassination and the fall of the government. All this leads to riots and popular fury against Muslims and transsexuals across Varanasi. Lisa Durnau discovers that at the center of the mysterious asteroid is an 8-billion-year-old grey sphere, possibly a black hole remnant, or an alien artifact from another civilization. This \\"Tabernacle\\" communicates a message to the scientists, and this leads Lisa to India to find Thomas Lull, who alone can explain this phenomenon. Explanation of title The title refers to the sacred Ganges River, which is analogous to the unceasing flow of time in Hindu mythology. Characters visit the river during the novel, and a large portion of the action takes place in the holy city of Varanasi, which is traditionally associated with the Ganges, and is the focal point in the story. Main characters * Mr. Nandha is a Krishna Cop whose job it is to excommunicate rogue aeais. Parvati is his wife, a country girl who tries to cope with boredom at home and the class dynamics of the big city. * Vishram Ray is an aspiring stand-up comedian who finds himself controlling the energy giant Ray Power, after his father's sudden retirement into sanyas. * Tal is a genderless nute working as a set designer for India's most ubiquitous tivi soapi - Town & Country, watched by millions. * Shaheen Badoor Khan is a powerful civil servant, and direct secretary to the Prime Minister, Sajida Rana. * Shiv and Yogendra are small-time hoodlums caught up in the larger flow of events. * Najia Askarzadah is a Swedish-Afghan reporter who ambitiously jumps into the civil war brewing in the subcontinent. * Lisa Durnau is a physicist who has been sent to an asteroid by the US government, to see what's inside the alien artifact. * Thomas Lull is an AI genius living in exile in India, hiding away his past. * Ajmer Rao is a mystical girl who can see into people's futures, and is searching for her biological parents.

The power was never used (and indeed was allowed to lapse by the Scottish Government in 2007Scottish Variable Rate of tax no longer available) and was succeeded by the legislative framework for Scottish public finance in the Scotland Act 2012, which gives the Scottish Parliament the power to set a Scottish rate of income tax. When legislating for the Scottish Parliament, a number of matters were reserved by the UK Parliament at Westminster. One such reserved matter was taxation; however, this had been a key point in Scottish negotiations relating to parliamentary control. As a means of compromise, Westminster afforded the Scottish Parliament the ability to vary income tax, which was subsequently given the consent of the Scottish electorate in the second question of the 1997 devolution referendum. Therefore, the Scotland Act 1998 granted the Scottish Parliament the power to vary income tax by ±3p in every pound. This power was often referred to as the tartan tax, a phrase first used by Conservative financier and politician Michael Forsyth as a way of attacking the power, using the idea of 'tartan' to get across the idea that it would be an extra tax on Scots alone.Tartan Tax History Channel However, the phrase \\"tartan tax\\" would only correctly apply if the tax were varied upwards – no phrase was ever suggested if the tax were varied downwards.

In 2014, St Pats reached the third round of the Challenge Cup, and were drawn against Leigh Centurions. Although St Pats were drawn at home, the club played the fixture at Leigh Sports Village, as their own ground did not meet the RFL's minimum requirements to host the fixture. St Pats were defeated 6–74. In January 2015, the club announced that they would not be taking part in the 2015 Challenge Cup, as \\"it was not in the players or clubs interest to enter the competition this year\\". Although cup matches against professional opposition usually generate a significant financial windfall for amateur teams, St Pats revealed they had made just £63 from their Challenge Cup game against Leigh in the previous year due to the costs of hosting the game at another venue.

On January 22, 2002, he also completed a half-marathon on the South Pole as a part of the Adventure Network's inaugural South Pole Marathon. In 2007 he embarked on a quest to set a world record by completing marathons on each of the seven continents in the shortest period of time, but while completing them in 35 days was beaten to the record by Richard Takata of Canada. A second attempt later in 2007 was unsuccessful as well, due to a delay of eight days en route to Antarctica. The record was finally broken by Kern on 1 December 2011 in 25 days, 18 hours, 10 minutes. It was Kern’s third attempt at the record. In 2007 he tried to beat the then-record of 99 days with a 35-day schedule. Then, he found out Takata—who had run in four marathons with Kern during that time—had finished in less than 30 days, and Kern still had two marathons to remaining. Later that same year, Kern tried to finish in 25 days, but he got stuck in Punta Arenas, Chile, for eight days before his seventh and final run due to bad weather that prevented him from traveling to Antarctica.

Plot The series followed Carl, Andy and Jon as three self-proclaimed Generation X-ers going through life without any real responsibilities to worry them. However, whilst this was understandable in the Madchester era of the late 1980s, is it acceptable now as they approach thirty? When does the party end? The responsibilities of potential fatherhood are weighing down on each in a different way: Carl's girlfriend is desperate for commitment, Jon is torturing himself over the daughter he gave up for adoption when he was 17, and Andy discovers that it is he who may be soon enjoying the pleasures of being a parent. This sets off a series of events, leading each to explore their new challenges and grow past their Gen X labels. Jon slowly builds a relationship with both his daughter and her mother (Tina). While, Andy's relationship with Emma experiences its ups and downs, with an unfortunate ending. Carl attempts to settle both his financial and personal life to that of an adult. In Season 2, Carl and Emma are in love, although Carl is reluctant to broadcast the fact. Forced to do so has negative effects on his friendships. Jon begins a downward spiral that ends with a second suicide attempt forcing him to grow up and become a parent. Andy returns and havoc for Carl and Emma soon ensue. By the end of the series each character has found their place in the world. Production Burn It was written by Matt Greenhalgh and produced by Red Production Company, an organisation most notable for its many cutting-edge, northern dramas such as Clocking Off, Conviction , New Street Law and Linda Green. To a soundtrack of North West England bands and musicians, including New Order, The Stone Roses and The Charlatans to name but a few, the show displayed a lazy world of drinking, drug consumption, and casual sex. However, the show was careful to show the consequences of such lifestyle choices and searingly touched on suicide, unwanted pregnancies, apathy and disillusionment. According to Red Production Company a DVD release is not possible due to difficulty in clearing copyrights for music used. Broadcast Burn It was first shown on the free-to-air British digital channel BBC Three, and then repeated some months later on the terrestrial channel BBC2. There were two series of Burn It: series one consisted of ten approximately 30-minute episodes and ran from 9 February 2003 to 8 April 2003; the second series spanned eleven episodes and ran from 8 September 2003 to 10 November 2003.

Foley held the rank of Professor of Law at Michigan State University College of Law and an adjunct professor at the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. She joined the FIU College of Law as one of its \\"founding faculty\\" in 2002. Foley was awarded a Fulbright grant in spring 2011, conducting research on medical futility at the School of Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway. , she continues to teach at Florida International University, where she also served for a time as the Executive Director of the Florida chapter of the Institute for Justice, where she litigated constitutional cases relating to economic liberty, property rights, free speech, and school choice. Foley was a member of the Committee on Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research of the Institute for Medicine, National Academy of Sciences. She presently serves on the editorial board of the Cato Supreme Court Review and on the Research Advisory Council of the James Madison Institute. Books Foley's most recent book is The Tea Party: Three Principles (Cambridge University Press, February 2012; ), In it, she challenges the media's characterization of the American Tea Party movement, asserting that it has been distorted in a way that prevents meaningful political dialogue and may even be dangerous for America's future. Foley sees the Tea Party as a movement of principles over politics. She identifies three \\"core principles\\" of American constitutional law that bind the decentralized, wide-ranging movement: limited government, unapologetic U.S. sovereignty, and constitutional originalism. These three principles, Foley explains, both define the Tea Party movement and predict its effect on the American political landscape. Foley explains the three principles' significance to the American founding and constitutional structure. She then connects the principles to current issues as health care reform, illegal immigration, the war on terror, and internationalism. Foley's prior books include The Law of Life and Death (Harvard University Press, 2011; ), which examines the many, and surprisingly ambiguous, legal definitions of what counts as human life and death. The book was the basis for a Tedx talk, \\"When are you really dead?,\\" delivered in fall 2012. In the book, Foley reveals that \\"not being dead\\" is not necessarily the same as being alive, in the eyes of the law. She also explains how the need for more organ transplants and the need to conserve health care resources are exerting steady pressure to expand the legal definition of death. As a result, death is being declared faster than ever before. The \\"right to die,\\" Foley worries, may be morphing slowly into an obligation to die. Her first book, Liberty for All: Reclaiming Individual Privacy in a New Era of Public Morality (Yale University Press, 2006; ), asserts that there is a \\"morality of American law\\", defined by the twin principles of limited government and residual individual sovereignty. These twin principles, moreover, reveal that there is a harm principle that animates American law and defines the moral use of governmental power to restrict individual liberty. In December 2006, the book won the Lysander Spooner Award for advancing the literature of liberty. Media appearances Foley is a frequent commentator on constitutional and health care law for American media, including CNN, Fox News, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and Instapundit.\\"Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research, Appendix B, Committee Biographies\\" (2005) National Academy of Sciences.

In theological spheres, egalitarianism generally means equality in authority and responsibilities between genders, in contrast to complementarianism.* * This entails women being able to exercise spiritual authority as clergy. Christian egalitarians argue that verses cited to justify certain restrictions on women have been misunderstood, and support \\"mutual submission\\" of all people to each other in relationships and human institutions as a form of respect without necessarily requiring a hierarchy in authority.Padgett, Alan G. \\"What Is Biblical Equality?\\" Priscilla Papers, Summer 2002: 16:3 Padgett is professor of Systematic Theology at Luther Seminary, St. Paul, MN. Gender equality According to Christian egalitarianism, gender equality is biblically sound in Christian church leadership (including pastors) and in Christian marriage. Its theological foundations are interpretations of the teachings and example of Jesus Christ and other New Testament principles.The Blue Parakeet: Rethinking How You Read the Bible Scot McKnight - 2008 \\"The former is often called \\"complementarian\\" and the latter \\"egalitarian,\\" though simple labels mask both the seriousness of the views as well as nuances within and between such views. The term \\"complementarian\\" fudges the reality; ... \\" It refers to a biblically-based belief that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer's gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that women and men are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another.Groothuis, Rebecca Merrill. \\"The Bible and Gender Equality.\\" Christians for Biblical Equality Web site Egalitarian beliefs are generally subscribed to by Quakers, United Methodist Churches, The Presbyterian Church (USA), The Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians (ECO), Northern Baptists, Church of the Nazarene, Wesleyan Church, The Evangelical Covenant Church, and some Pentecostal churches such as the Assemblies of God and United Church of God. The opposing view is complementarianism, a view which holds that differing, often non-overlapping roles between men and women, manifested in marriage, church leadership, and elsewhere, are biblically required. Complementarianism is the belief that men were created for the headship role and women were created for the support role.  Biblical justifications  All three Synoptic Gospels record Jesus as saying: According to Clive Marsh and Steve Moyise, while \\"lord it over\\" implies abusive leadership, Jesus' words \\"exercise authority\\" have no connotation of abuse of authority.Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. Jesus and the Gospels. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. The Apostle Paul wrote: Christian egalitarians' interpretation of scriptures and spiritual convictions bring them to the conclusion that the manner and teaching of Jesus abolished discrimination against racial minorities, slaves, and women in both the church and marriage. They believe that the Bible teaches the fundamental equality of believers of all racial and ethnic groups and all economic classes.http://www.spiritrestoration.org/Church/ministry-profile-christians- for-biblical-equality.htm Christians for Biblical Equality They consider overarching principles of the Bible to be that men and women are equally created in God's image, equally responsible for sin, equally redeemed by Christ, and equally gifted by God's Spirit for service and held responsible for using their God-given gifts.Edwards, B.

Aquila appears first in the first, third and fifth mentions, and Priscilla (Prisca) first in the second, fourth and sixth mentions., , , , , Authorized Version Some revisions of the Bible put Priscilla rather than Aquila first, in Acts 18:26, following the Vulgate and a few Greek texts. Some scholars suggest that Priscilla was the head of the family unit. Ultimately, Christian egalitarianism holds that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status. A significant source of this trend of thought is the Christian notion that humankind were created in the living image of God (Imago Dei). Jesus Christ did not conform to a mentality unfavorable to women, but reacted against inequalities based on sexual differences.Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. Woman in the World of Jesus. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978 Illustrative of efforts to institutionalize this notion are these excerpts from the organizational Statement of Faith of Christians for Biblical Equality, a major Christian Egalitarian organization: History Anna Oliver, a Methodist who demanded full clergy rights for women in 1880. The first organization whose purpose was advocating Christian egalitarianism was \\"Men, Women and God\\", established in the United Kingdom in 1984. The American organization Christians for Biblical Equality was established by evangelicals in 1987.  Egalitarian anthropologies  Titled in accordance with Rosemary Radford Ruether's work in Christian theology, Egalitarian anthropologies explore varying views of gender equality in Christianity. These include eschatological feminism, liberal feminism, and romantic feminism. According to Ruether, the commonality among these anthropologies is the belief that gender equality was the original intention of God and that it was somehow skewed by humanity. Ruether goes on to point out that the belief in the ideal of gender equality \\"leaves room for considerable variation in relating this equality to woman's present subjugated state in history under patriarchy.\\" In the preceding statement, Ruether qualifies the need for further exploration into the following anthropologies. = Eschatological feminism = Ruether connects eschatological feminism to mysticism and asceticism by way of its roots in transcendentalism. Her assertion is that the original human, Adam, was androgynous and that \\"the fall\\" was the initial creation of gender. She reaffirms this point in a later article, \\"Sexism and Misogyny in the Christian Tradition: Liberating Alternatives\\", referencing Galatians 3:28, saying that through baptism androgyny is restored. Sexuality, the main division between genders, is said to be the root of female subordination. Relationships that are typically rooted in sexuality (marriage and motherhood) place women in roles that are subordinate in accordance with society's patriarchal norms. The path to equality is believed to be found when women transcend these roles—traditionally through celibacy (as seen in the life of Paul). Transcending worldly norms, which the Bible instructs Christians to do, brings men and women to the state of androgyny that eliminates gender subordination; thus, Christianity is intended to manifest gender equality. Ruether says that transcendence is the core of eschatological feminism; women reach equality with men by separating from the world, rather than changing it. = Liberal feminism = Liberal feminism rejects the notion that creation established the patriarchy; Ruether asserts that gender equality originally existed, but was distorted by historical injustices against women. This branch of egalitarianism dictates that gender equality must be restored rather than introduced. This restoration will be accomplished by economic, political, social, and systemic reformation. Ruether includes the church in her discussion of social reform, displaying its participation in gender subordination. Ruether continues saying, \\"The Church as a bearer of redeemed humanity ought especially to represent this equality of men and women in its institutional life. But it does so as a paradigm of what all social institutions should become, not as a representative of an eschatological humanity outside of and beyond history.\\" Here she distinguishes liberal from eschatological feminism stating that liberal feminism calls for liberation within society, rather than removal from it. = Romantic feminism = Ruether states that in romantic feminism the distinction between genders is found primarily in \\"spiritual\\" traits. Ruether references a sixteenth century humanist, Cornelius Agrippa, saying that women have an \\"affinity with divine Wisdom that gives them moral and spiritual superiority.\\" Women are perceived to be innately altruistic, sensitive, and pure—traits that are considered morally superior compared to \\"male traits.\\" Ruether continues saying that men and women are both inherently capable of goodness, but because of the patriarchy placing men into positions of power, more negative character traits are manifested (pride, aggression, dominance, etc.). Since women are not allowed into positions of power, Ruether supposes that they retain humanity's natural goodness. Romantic feminism contains varying ideologies in itself which are as follows.  Conservative romanticism  According to Ruether, conservative romanticism suggests that women remain in the home in order to maintain their goodness. Ruether says, \\"If a woman leaves the home to take up a traditional male occupation, she will straightaway lose this good femininity and become a she-male, a monstrous virago, or will become debased to carnal femaleness, fallen woman.\\" In one survey conducted in 1999, a researcher concluded based on participants' responses, \\"Even though husbands were not always the sole providers, for the majority of men they remained symbolically so, such that women's employment was nearly always described as secondary, even expendable, in light of wives' responsibility to rear and nurture children.\\" Conservative romanticism opposes gender equality in the work force in order to better preserve traditional roles in the home. Women's innate goodness makes her the ideal candidate to raise children and to support the husband. In turn, this spousal support allows the husband to perform better in the workforce; this trickle effect of women sending good husbands and sons into the world is how conservative romantics suppose women make an impact.  Reformist romanticism  Reformist romanticism aligns with conservative romanticism except in the reformist belief that the inherent goodness of women cannot be lost by equality in society. Ruether says that this ideology prescribes women to morally reform men and male-centric institutions, but to do so they require education, voting rights, and political power. Reformist romanticism believes that the innate goodness of women is needed in leadership positions to improve the nature of the world. It is also believed that the nature of women is incompatible with war and that under female leadership, the world would be at peace.  Radical romanticism  Radical feminism rejects the entirety of male culture and debates whether males can be redeemed at all. Ruether says that radical feminists desire a utopian society completely independent from males in which women's inherent goodness is unimpeded by male inferiority. Criticism =Roman Catholic Church= The Roman Catholic Church has formally opposed radical egalitarianism and has stated that the differences between men and women are not merely phenomenal, but are in fact ontological in nature. In his 2004 Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger warned against a related tendency to see gender as culturally constructed, which has generated \\"a new model of polymorphous sexuality\\", which reflects an \\"attempt to be free from one’s biological conditioning\\".

Background The game follows the basic structure of Formula One 06 for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The main differences include the updated visuals for the PS3 including a lot more detail, Sixaxis compatibility, real time reflections, car reflections on wet circuits and new wet weather effects. It was announced early in development that the safety car would be included in the game for the first time in an F1 game since Formula One 99 for the PlayStation. However, it was removed before the final release along with the PSP wing mirror integration shown at E3. The game also boasts dynamic weather, and improved AI. The AI system is called \\"Live Action Racing\\" where one can pressure the opposition, causing them to make little mistakes such as running wide on corners, causing them to crash into other cars or spin off the road of their own accord. The AI will then try to seek opportunities to pass the player in a realistic manner. The game is based on the early 2006 Formula One World Championship. Hence, Yuji Ide drives for Super Aguri when in reality he lost his super licence just 4 races into the '06 Formula One World Championship, and Franck Montagny, then later Sakon Yamamoto took his seat. Other minor changes throughout the real 2006 Formula One World Championship are also not represented, therefore Pedro de la Rosa, Robert Kubica. Robert Doornbos, Franck Montagny and Sakon Yamamoto are not featured. Also, the Midland team are not re-branded as Spyker in later Grands Prix in the game. In the career mode, players begin by running tests for one of three teams (Toro Rosso, Super Aguri or Midland F1) at either the Silverstone, Magny Cours or Catalunya circuits. The tests given vary between the teams. When the player successfully completes the tests, they are given the role of test driver or race driver, depending on how well the player performed in the test. After performing well as a test driver, the player will become the second driver of the team. From there the player can compete in race weekends through many different roles. As a test driver the player will try out different car settings in practice, and as a driver the player will have track position targets to meet to keep the seat. The player's performances are subject to review at several points during the season. The initial release did not include force-feedback support, which is considered by many to be an important feature for simulation racing games used with driving wheel controllers. A subsequent update in early 2008 added force feedback. The game also lacks support for 1080i or 1080p output resolutions. Per the calendar, the Belgian Grand Prix is not included. Gameplay Formula One Championship Edition follows the 2006 Formula One World Championship, with 18 tracks, 11 teams and 22 drivers. Driver changes that happened during the real 2006 Formula One World Championship are also not included, such as Juan Pablo Montoya leaving McLaren after the United States Grand Prix and replaced by Pedro de la Rosa and Jacques Villeneuve leaving BMW Sauber after the German Grand Prix and replaced by Robert Kubica. Release Formula One Championship Edition was released in North America on February 27, 2007. It was the first Formula One game to be released there since 2003, when Atari released Grand Prix Challenge exclusively for PlayStation 2 and EA Sports released F1 Challenge '99-'02 for the PC, and F1 Career Challenge for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube. It was a launch title for the European and Australasian release of the PlayStation 3. Formula One Championship Edition was the final release in Sony's series of F1 games which had been running for over a decade, with the announcement that Codemasters had secured exclusive rights to the sport following shortly after the game's release. As this game was effectively an update of the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable game Formula One 06, there was to be no 2007 version of the game - the first time the series had skipped a season since 1996. This was the most recent F1 game given the three- season gap before Sumo Digital's F1 2009 (published by Codemasters) game came out on PSP and Nintendo Wii. In September 2010, Codemasters released F1 2010 with all the official teams and tracks, available on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 30 out of 40. 411Mania gave it an eight out of ten and called it \\"high-octane fun. With deep customization and an intriguing season that will leave gamers feeling satisfied. The racing itself feels smooth and natural as you slide through each turn. With graphics I could stare at all day and fun that doesn’t get old, this may just be the game that brings Formula One racing to the forefront.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three stars out of five and said, \\"if you are an F1 purist, you will discover a comprehensive and challenging simulation that offers long-term appeal.\\" However, Detroit Free Press gave it two stars out of four, stating, \\"How well can you follow a big green line? The game shows you the shortest distance around the track -- a green line to follow. The line turns briefly red when you come to a turn, but don't ease up on the throttle, because the game slows your vehicle down for you.

The metaphor is derived from a pattern of behavior noted in crabs when they are trapped in a bucket. While any one crab could easily escape, its efforts will be undermined by others, ensuring the group's collective demise. The analogy in human behavior is claimed to be that members of a group will attempt to reduce the self- confidence of any member who achieves success beyond the others, out of envy, resentment, spite, conspiracy, or competitive feelings, to halt their progress.  Impact on performance  Crab mentality affects performance in an organization as humans behave in similar manner as the crabs particularly within social teams. The impact of crab mentality on performance was quantified by a New Zealand study in 2015 which demonstrated up to an 18% average exam result improvement for students when their grades were reported in a way that prevented others from knowing their position in published rankings.

Block (born June 28, 1947) is an American sociologist, and Research Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Davis. Block is widely regarded as one of the world’s leading economic and political sociologists. His interests are wide ranging. He has been noted as an influential follower of Karl Polanyi. Block has served on the Board of the Karl Polanyi Institute of Political Economy since 1989 and was a Distinguished Scientific Visitor to the Republic of China in 1995. He has also written for The Nation, The American Prospect, In These Times, Commonweal, Boston Review, and Tikkun. Biography Block is the son of attorney Frederick H. Block. He formerly taught at the University of Pennsylvania. He is married to Carole Joffe, a sociologist, author and activist for women's reproductive rights. They have two children. Works Block first came to prominence for his dissertation which was later published as the Origins of International Economic Disorder: Study of United States International Monetary Policy from World War II to the Present. In this study he asserted what would become a career long interest in the destabilizing influence of unregulated capital flows across national borders. He would also publish an influential argument on the nature of the elite called The Ruling Class Does Not Rule, which began a decade long debate with social psychologist G. William Domhoff. Block is the author of five major books: The Vampire State and Other Myths and Fallacies About The U.S. Economy (1996), Postindustrial Possibilities: A Critique of Economic Discourse (1990), The Mean Season: The Attack On the Welfare State (co-authored with Richard A. Cloward, Barbara Ehrenreich, and Frances Fox Piven) (1987), Revising State Theory: Essays In Politics and Postindustrialism (1987), and The Origins of International Economic Disorder: A Study of United States International Monetary Policy From World War II to the Present (1977). In 2000, he edited the many editions of Karl Polanyi's classic work The Great Transformation into a single edition. He has also published many journal articles on economic sociology, political sociology, sociology of work, and sociological theory in Politics & Society, World Policy Journal, Socialist Review, Theory and Society, Annual Review of Sociology, and Social Problems. In later years, Block gained a more exclusively economic focus publishing three extremely influential works that included two books, Postindustrial Possibilities and The Vampire State; as well as a more proscriptive article on ways capitalist economies could be reformed for more just and efficient results in Capitalism without Class Power. Of these, Postindustrial Possibilities is the most widely regarded as a sweeping statement on the findings of economic sociology as a field of study combined with Block’s own original contribution woven into the narrative. The Vampire State marks a bit of a return to explicitly political content although it is embedded into a discussion of United States economic policy. Block's 2014 book, The Power of Market Fundamentalism: Karl Polyani's Critique (HUP, 2014), which he co-authored with Margaret Somers, examines the rise of free-market ideology from the ashes of the Great Depression, and looks more generally at its continued survival in the face of laissez-faire's repeated failures. His most recent book, Capitalism: the Future of an Illusion (University of California Press, 2018), explores the illusory view that capitalist economies are autonomous, coherent, and regulated by their own internal laws. Block's argument is that the capitalist illusion is an entire economistic social theory that has become part of society’s common sense. The work contends that restoring the vitality of the United States and the world economy can be accomplished only with major reforms on the scale of the New Deal and the post–World War II building of new global institutions.

The southern terminus is Pennsylvania Route 435 in Covington Township and the northern terminus is Pennsylvania Route 92 in Tunkhannock Township. The highway is called Scranton - Pocono Highway south of Scranton. Route description PA 307 near its northern terminus at PA 92 in Tunkhannock Township PA 307 begins at a Y intersection with PA 435 in Covington Township in Lackawanna County, heading northwest on four-lane undivided Scranton-Pocono Highway. The road runs through forested areas with some homes, coming to an intersection with PA 502 in the community of Fells Corners. The route heads through more woodland with some fields and development and comes to an interchange with I-380 at exit 20. Past this interchange, PA 307 continues through forests with some homes and enters Spring Brook Township, where it crosses PA 690 at Quinlan Corners in the community of Maple Lake. The road continues through rural land and enters Roaring Brook Township, where it heads across the forested Moosic Mountains, passing east of Coon Hill. The route heads to the east of the Williams Bridge Reservoir and curves to the north, narrowing to a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. The road heads into a section of the borough of Dunmore and turns to the northwest. PA 307 enters the city of Scranton and becomes two-lane Moosic Street, passing to the north of Lake Scranton and curving west. The road gains a center left-turn lane and runs west-southwest through wooded areas with homes. The route becomes a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes and bends to the west- northwest, running through woodland and passing under an abandoned railroad line. PA 307 widens into a four-lane divided highway and crosses I-81, with a ramp from southbound I-81 to PA 307. Past this interchange, the route runs past businesses and becomes a three-lane undivided road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane, heading through residential areas. The road narrows to two lanes and continues northwest to an intersection with US 11. At this point, PA 307 turns north to form a concurrency with US 11 on a divided road and comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of the Central Scranton Expressway. The two routes cross over Roaring Brook and the Electric City Trolley Museum line and head north as a six-lane divided highway, passing under a Delaware–Lackawanna Railroad line and curving northwest to enter downtown Scranton on Spruce Street. US 11/PA 307 turns northeast onto city- maintained Jefferson Avenue, with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. The road runs past downtown commercial development as it heads to the west of the University of Scranton campus. The two routes turn northwest onto state-maintained four-lane undivided Mulberry Street and runs past more businesses. Upon crossing Wyoming Avenue, the road becomes a divided highway and continues to an intersection with Mifflin Avenue. At this point, US 11/PA 307 becomes a four-lane freeway called the North Scranton Expressway and passes over a Delaware–Lackawanna Railroad line and the Lackawanna River. The highway comes to an interchange with Providence Road that provides a connection to 7th Avenue and access to Memorial Staduum. From here, the freeway heads north near residential and commercial development and runs parallel to Norfolk Southern's Sunbury Line to the west, coming to a diamond interchange with North Main Avenue. The highway continues north-northeast through more of the city alongside the railroad tracks, bending to the north- northwest. PA 307 splits from the US 11 freeway at a diamond interchange by heading west on four-lane undivided Keyser Avenue, passing under the Norfolk Southern tracks. The route turns north onto Morgan Highway, a three-lane road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane and runs through wooded areas with some commercial development, curving to the northwest. PA 307 leaves Scranton for South Abington Township and traverses forested Bald Mountain, running a short distance to the northeast of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension (I-476).

The route continues through rural land and development and passes to the east of Summit Lake, bending to the north-northwest and heading into the borough of Clarks Summit. PA 307 curves west-southwest and reenters South Abington Township, running through a mix of fields and woods with some development. The road crosses into Newton Township and becomes Winola Road. The route passes to the north of Clarks Summit State Hospital and winds west through more rural land, passing to the north of the community of Schultzville. PA 307 enters Falls Township in Wyoming County and becomes Roosevelt Highway, continuing to wind west through forests with some farm fields and homes. The road curves to the north and passes through the community of Mill City, crossing into Overfield Township. The route heads north through forests to the community of Lake Winola, where it turns west and runs through wooded areas of homes to the south of Lake Winola. PA 307 bends to the north and heads along the west side of the lake before it makes a sharp curve to the west. The road heads through forests with sparse development and enters Tunkhannock Township. PA 307 comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 92 on the east bank of the Susquehanna River. History Prior to 1989, PA 307 followed an older alignment bypassing Downtown Scranton. On Moosic Street, just north of I-81, PA 307 turned right on Harrison Avenue, starting a concurrency with US 11. Together they crossed the Harrison Avenue bridge and continued about a mile to Myrtle Street. PA 307 and US 11 turned right on Myrtle for one block then left on Wheeler Avenue. After entering the Borough of Dunmore and crossing the old Erie Railroad tracks, the pair turned left on Cherry Street then bore right onto South Blakely Street, entering Downtown Dunmore. They turned left onto Green Ridge Street, re-entering Scranton in the Green Ridge section of the city. At the end of Green Ridge Street at North Scranton Junior High School, they turned right onto Main Avenue entering the Providence section of the city. After a half mile, they turned left onto West Market Street. PA 307 left US 11 by turning left onto Keyser Avenue, passing under the North Scranton Expressway, and turning right onto the Morgan Highway, re-entering its current alignment.

On May 26, 1915, a young woman named Anna Johnson was found dead in Shaver's home, with a bullet hole in her head. Police speculated that Johnson had died of complications of an abortion performed by Shaver, who then shot the dead woman in the head in an attempt to pass the death off as a suicide. Abortion was illegal at the time.Leslie J. Reagan, When Abortion Was A Crime, University of California Press 1997 Shaver was tried for Johnson's death, as well as for the death of another abortion patient in 1916. Although she was a physician, the case rekindled a campaign against midwives, since journalists and politicians assumed that female physicians were midwives and that midwives provided abortions. Coverage exaggerated the idea that young girls were being killed by botched abortions from abortion providers, when in reality most deaths were from self-induced abortions.  Education and practice  Eva Shaver graduated with her doctorate degree from The National Medical University.The Illinois Medical Journal (Vol. 29). (1916). Illinois State Medical Society. The National Medical University was a credible university until it was closed by the department of health soon after Dr. Shaver received her degree.Reagan, L. J. (2008). When abortion was a crime: women, medicine, and law in the United States, 1867-1973. Berkeley, Calif: University of California Press. Dr. Eva Shaver lived with her son Clarence Shaver in their Chicago home. She worked as a midwife while her son Clarence Shaver owned an \\"abortion parlor\\" to sell abortion pills.  Illegal abortions  In May 1915, a young man named Marshall Hostetler met up with Clarence Shaver and asked for a pill to cure his lover, Anna Johnson, of an unwanted pregnancy. After finding that the abortion pills did not work, Clarence requested that the couple pay a visit to his mother Dr. Eva Shaver, the midwife. Anna Johnson then travelled to Dr. Shaver and her son's illegal abortion clinic in their Chicago home. At this time, Dr. Eva Shaver was 25 years old and had severely botched Anna Johnson's abortion and in effort to cover up the mistake, she and Clarence made it appear as though Anna had committed suicide. It was not until the next day when W.C. Harvey, a roommate at the Shaver home, discovered Anna Johnson's body and reported it to the police. When the police arrived at the Shaver home, Dr. Eva Shaver claimed that she had hired Anna Johnson as her housekeeper recently. Dr. Shaver claimed to have been working on a house call when she committed suicide in her sons room inside their home. However, the police were very skeptical of Dr. Shaver and suspected she was performing illegal abortions . The police's suspicion led them to look below her floorboards for aborted babies that she might be hiding. The police finally noticed that the revolver in Anna Johnson's left hand belonged to Clarence Shaver.Shavers and Harvey Held to Grand Jury. (1915, May 29). The Day Book. The bullet that killed Anna Johnson entered the right side of her head, which puzzled the police because the revolver was found in her left hand. Following the trial, many newspapers combined with the press emphasized the dangers of abortion and midwifery. Midwives were blamed by politicians and the press for the problem of abortion in the country. The 1915 campaigns against abortion caused enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. In Chicago, police arrested more physicians for abortion than ever before. With the new enforcement of abortion laws, Dr. Shaver was held for trial for Anna Johnson's death. Then later in 1916, Dr. Eva Shaver was found guilty of manslaughter when she killed Lillian Glovenco, an 18 year old bride, during an abortion. With the murder of Lillian Glovenco, Dr. Shaver was able to be connected to the death of Anna Johnson.

Stone Age cave painting George Stubbs, Whistlejacket, c. 1762, National Gallery, London. Horses have appeared in works of art throughout history, frequently as depictions of the horse in battle. The horse appears less frequently in modern art partly because the horse is no longer significant either as a mode of transportation or as an implement of war. Most modern representations are of famous contemporary horses, artwork associated with horse racing, or artwork associated with the historic cowboy or Native American tradition of the American west. In the United Kingdom depictions of fox hunting and nostalgic rural scenes involving horses continue to be made. Horses often appear in artworks singly, as a mount for an important person, or in teams, hitched to a variety of horse-drawn vehicles. History =Prehistory= Bronze Statuette of a Horse, late 2nd – 1st century B.C. Metropolitan Museum of Art Assyrian horses, Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal reliefs from Nineveh, 7th century BCE The horse appeared in prehistoric cave paintings such as those in Lascaux,Lascaux caves official website.(retrieved 09/09/2011Lascaux) estimated to be about 17,000 years old. Prehistoric hill figures have been carved in the shape of the horse, specifically the Uffington White Horse, an example of the tradition of horse carvings upon hill-sides, which having existed for thousands of years continues into the current age. BBC video.Retrieved 09/09/2011 The Upper Palaeolithic Vogelherd figurines discovered in Germany, miniature sculptures made of mammoth ivory attributed to paleo-humans of the Aurignacian culture that are among the world’s oldest- known works of figurative art, include a figure of a horse. =Ancient World= The equine image was common in ancient Egyptian and Grecian art, more refined images displaying greater knowledge of equine anatomy appeared in Classical Greece and in later Roman work. Horse-drawn chariots were commonly depicted in ancient works, for example on the Standard of Ur circa 2500BC. The Greeks and Romans invented the equestrian statue; the best surviving example being the Equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. The Horses of Saint Mark are the sole surviving example from Classical Antiquity of a monumental statue of the Quadriga. The horse was less prevalent in early Christian and Byzantine art, overwhelmed by the dominance of religious themes. =Renaissance and after= The Renaissance period starting in the 14th century brought a resurgence of the horse in art. Painters of this period who portrayed the horse included Paolo Uccello, Benozzo Gozzoli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Raphael, Andrea Mantegna and Titian. In 1482 the Duke of Milan Ludovico il Moro, commissioned Leonardo da Vinci to create the largest equestrian statue in the world, a monument to the duke's father Francesco, however Leonardo's horse was never completed, (until it was replicated in the late 20th century). In the Baroque era the tradition of equine portraiture was established, with artists such as Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck and Diego Velázquez portraying regal subjects atop their mounts. Equine sporting art also became established in this era as the tradition of horse racing emerged under Tudor patronage. =18th and 19th centuries= Eugène Delacroix, Horse Frightened by Lightning, 1825-1829, watercolour, lead white on paper, 23.6 x 32 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest Rosa Bonheur, The Horse Fair, 1853–1855, Metropolitan Museum of Art George Stubbs born in 1724 became so associated with his equestrian subjects that he was known as \\"the horse painter\\". A childhood interest in anatomy was applied to the horse he spent eighteen months dissecting equine carcasses and had an engraver produce book plates of his studies. These anatomical drawings aided later artists. The mid 18th century saw the emergence of Romanticism, French artists Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix were proponents of this movement and both portrayed the horse in many of their works. Equine sporting art was popular in the 19th century, notable artists of the period being Benjamin Marshall, James Ward, Henry Thomas Alken, James Pollard, John Frederick Herring Sr. and Heywood Hardy. Horse racing gradually became more established in France and Impressionist painter Edgar Degas painted many early racing scenes. Degas was one of the first horse painters to use photographic references. Eadweard Muybridge's photographic studies of animal motion had a huge influence on equine art as they allowed artists greater understanding of the horses gaits. Rosa Bonheur became famous primarily for two chief works: Ploughing in the Nivernais (in French: Le labourage nivernais, le sombrage),Galerie.roi-president.com and, The Horse Fair (in French: Le marché aux chevaux)Metmuseum.org (which was exhibited at the Salon of 1853 (finished in 1855) and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York City. Bonheur is widely considered to have been the most famous female painter of the nineteenth century.Janson, H. W., Janson, Anthony F. History of Art. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers. 6th edition. , page 674. Isidore Bonheur, the younger brother of Rosa Bonheur, is known as one of the 19th century's most distinguished French animalier sculptors.Christie's New York, Isidore-Jules BonheurIsidore-Jules Bonheur, Le Grand Jockey (A Horse and Jockey), bronze, Sotheby's London, 6 June 2007 He modeled his sculptures to catch movement or posture characteristic of the particular species. Isidore Bonheur achieved this most successfully with his sculptures of horses, usually depicted as relaxed rather than spirited, and which are among his most renowned works.Joconde, Le Ministère de la culture, Portail des collections des musées de France, Bonheur Isidore Jules =20th century= Sir Alfred Munnings was an acclaimed painter working in England during the 20th century, he was elected president of the Royal Academy in 1944. He specialised in equine subjects, including horse racing, portraiture and studies of gypsies and rural life. Subject genres =Military and war= Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo, Detail from The Procession of the Trojan Horse in Troy, (1773), inspired by Virgil's Aeneid Uccello, The Battle of San Romano, c. 1438–1440. Egg tempera with walnut oil and linseed oil on poplar. 181.6 x 320 cm. Uffizi. Military art often depicts the horse in battle and provides some of the earliest examples of the horse in art, with cavalry, horse-drawn chariots and horse archers all appearing on ancient artifacts. In the medieval period cavalry battles and knights on horseback were portrayed by artists including Paolo Uccello and Albrecht Dürer. Uccello's tryptic The Battle of San Romano shows various stages of a battle. Dürer's engraving of \\"Knight, Death and the Devil\\", 1513 shows a military subject combined with allegorical theme. Sir Alfred Munnings was appointed as a war artist during World War I, he painted both the Canadian Cavalry Brigade and the Canadian Forestry Corps stationed in France. He considered his experiences with the Canadian units to have been among the most rewarding events of his life. Elizabeth Thompson, known as Lady Butler, was famed for her military art, especially Scotland Forever featuring a dramatic charge by the Royal Scots Greys. =Horse racing= Edgar Degas, Before the Race, 1882–1884, oil on panel, The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore Eadweard Muybridge, Animated sequence of a race horse galloping, using photos published in 1887 (Animal Locomotion). Thoroughbred racing was an inspiration for Romantic and Impressionist artists of the 19th century. Théodore Géricault painted The Derby in 1821 during his stay in England. The Impressionist era coincided with the development of racing in France, Manet, Degas and Toulouse- Lautrec all acquired a lasting fascination with racing. Manet showing the excitement and action of the race and Degas concentrating more on the moments before the start. Degas was intensely interested in Muybridge's photographs of the horse in motion, he copied them in chalk and pencil and used them for reference in his later work. Generations of artists before Muybridge had portrayed the horse in a 'rocking horse' gallop with the horse portrayed with both front legs extended forward and both hind legs extended rearwards. Much more realistic representations were possible after the event of photography and Muybridge's work but that did not necessarily lead to the impression of movement in the artwork. Luard writing in 1921 compares the running action of an animal with the run and rhythm of an air in music, but the instantaneous moment recorded by a photograph as a detached chord with little meaning or context. George Stubbs and Alfred Munnings have both left a vast body of work involving the racehorse. In the 20th century, much of the artwork by John Skeaping involved the racing scene, including life-size bronzes of Hyperion and Brigadier Gerard and watercolours of race course action. =The American West= Charles Marion Russell, Buccaroos, 1902 Artwork associated with the historic cowboy or Native American tradition of the American west naturally includes many equine subjects. Artists of the American West include Frederic Remington and C.M. Russell who are known for their paintings of equine subjects. Remington was one of the first American artists to illustrate the true gait of the horse in motion (along with Thomas Eakins), as validated by the famous sequential photographs of Eadweard Muybridge.Peggy & Harold Samuels, Frederic Remington: A Biography, Doubleday & Co., Garden City NY, , p. 83. Remington also captured equine drama in his bronze sculptures, his first, Bronco Buster (Williams College Museum of Art), was a critical and commercial success. =Modern art= Inspired by El Greco's, Saint Martin and the Beggar, c. 1597–1600, Art Institute of Chicago Pablo Picasso introduced horses into his work in 1905-06 notably Boy Leading a Horse, Museum of Modern Art. Franz Marc and others including Susan Rothenberg and Deborah Butterfield beginning in the 1970s used horses as motifs in their paintings and sculpture throughout the 20th century. For a large and complex 20th century war painting in which a horse is the central dramatic figure, see Guernica by Pablo Picasso. While Impressionist painter Edgar Degas was particularly famous for his paintings of dancers, Degas was also known for his paintings of horses and horse racing. =Hunting= Hunting scenes have been a common subject matter for equestrian painters. Specialists in fox hunting subjects include Cecil Aldin and Lionel Edwards. =Rural/working life= Lucy Kemp-Welch was well known for her depiction of wild and working horses in the landscape.

Originally from Germany, the couple had been teaching at Dartmouth since the 1970s. High school classmates James J. Parker, age 16, and Robert W. Tulloch, age 17, were charged with first-degree murder. (see pp. 73–77) (see p. 96) Parker pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testifying against Tulloch, and was sentenced to 25 years, with possibility of parole after 16. Tulloch pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and received the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole (LWOP). In 2014 the New Hampshire Supreme Court ordered Tulloch's sentence reviewed under the US Supreme Court's holding that persons committing crimes as minors could not be sentenced as adults.  Half and Susanne Zantop  Half Zantop met Susanne while they were both studying at Stanford University in the mid-1960s. They were both from Germany Fascinated with geology, Half had earned a bachelor's degree from Freiburg University, while Susanne was working on her master's degree in political science. After Half earned a geology Ph.D. in 1969 at Stanford and worked as a field geologist, he and Susanne were married in 1970. They had two daughters, Veronika and Mariana. Susanne taught in the German department at Dartmouth College and was chair of that faculty. Half taught geology and earth science, and was popular among many of his students. In 2000, they had begun discussing retirement in the near future.  The murders  Tulloch and Parker went to the Zantop residence on the morning of January 27, 2001. Posing as students doing research for a school survey, they intended to take the occupants by surprise, threaten them into revealing their PINs, and rob and kill them. Half allowed them inside while Susanne was preparing a dish for a dinner she was hosting that evening at home. According to his confession, Parker said that Zantop was \\"an alright guy\\" and that they did not need to kill him. Tulloch allegedly became angered when Zantop, a professor of earth science, told him that he had to come more prepared (for questions for the purported research). Tulloch resented the comments and attacked Zantop when he turned away to look for a phone number. Tulloch took his SOG Knife and repeatedly stabbed Half in the chest and face, cutting his own leg accidentally in the process. When Susanne came from the kitchen and tried to stop him, Parker stabbed her, allegedly at Tulloch's orders. Tulloch also stabbed her in the head and body. Covered in blood, the pair left after taking $340 from Half's wallet. They left their knife sheaths at the scene.  Discovery and capture  The Zantops' bodies were found that evening by family friend Roxana Verona, who had arrived as an invited guest for dinner. She notified police. Investigators at first speculated that it was a crime of passion by someone having an affair with Half, but that idea was soon disproved. There were several false leads. (Associated Press reported at least three persons of interest were interviewed by police and that \\"A task force set up after the murders also received hundreds of phone calls, letters and e-mails from people with wild theories about the killings\\"). After finding a bloody footprint and the two distinctive knife sheaths at the scene, the police traced the knives to Parker three weeks after the murders. According to the 16-year-old Parker, he had not gotten into trouble at school or in the community. He had an alibi for the time of the crime. He said that he bought the knives with Tulloch in order to build a fort. He claimed that they sold them at a surplus store after finding they were too heavy. Parker agreed to undergo fingerprinting. The investigators paid Tulloch a visit. At that time, they doubted that the pair were the killers, and told Tulloch he was not required to speak with them. Tulloch did talk with them without a lawyer present and told them the same story as had Parker. When they asked about the deep cut above his right knee, he told them that he slipped on a rock and cut himself on a metal spigot. When they asked to fingerprint him and borrow boots for matching purposes, he signed a search warrant. The same request had not been made of Parker because it was suggested by a detective whom they had phoned to get his version of the story. On the following day, Tulloch and Parker's families found that the boys had left their homes. When Parker's father found a note stating \\"Don't call the cops\\", he quickly did. Police found that Tulloch's bootprints matched those found in the Zantops' home. Fingerprints taken from the two youths matched those at the crime scene. A warrant was put out for Tulloch's arrest. Parker, still a minor, was sought for questioning in the murders. Believing that police would be looking for their car, the pair abandoned Parker's silver Audi at a truck stop in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, intending to hitchhike to California. A truck driver who picked them up in New Jersey announced their intent to travel west via CB radio. A police officer, pretending to be another driver, offered to pick them up. At the Flying J truck stop in Spiceland, Indiana, the pair were captured and taken into custody by authorities.  Prosecution  One of the prosecutors in this case was assistant Attorney General Kelly Ayotte. She later was appointed as the State Attorney General. Later still she was elected as a U.S. Senator. The two youths were indicted on a range of charges. The indictment said that they had made four previous tries over six months to gain entry to houses in the area in Vermont and New Hampshire, with the intent of robbing their victims, getting their ATM cards and passwords, and then killing them. In the first case, on July 19, 2000, they cut the telephone wires to a house in Vershire, Vermont, before Tulloch knocked on the door and tried to gain entry with a story about his car having broken down. He was refused entry, as they were in the other three instances before they attacked the Zantops.Pam Belluck, \\"Indictment in Dartmouth Case Outlines Robbery-Killing Plan\\", New York Times, February 2, 2002; accessed March 13, 2017 After the two young men were captured and jailed pending trial, the prosecution charged Parker as an adult because of the severity of the crime, making him liable to stand trial. He made a plea bargain with the state in which he would testify against Tulloch as a witness, plead guilty to second-degree murder, and receive a maximum sentence of twenty-five years to life with a possibility of parole after 16 years. The profits from any book deals or movie offers that he might agree to will go directly to the Zantops' children. Parker was sentenced to twenty-five years. Tulloch's lawyer tried, without success, to have Tulloch certified as suffering from mental illness, in order to use the insanity defense. Tulloch pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. Sentencing During the sentencing hearing, Parker wept and expressed remorse during his apology for his part in the killings. He was sentenced to 25 years with a possibility of parole after 16. After Tulloch's guilty plea, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. He showed no emotion at the sentencing hearing and made no statement.  Aftermath  Parker is being held in the New Hampshire State Prison for Men in Concord. He has been classified as a Custody Level 3 prisoner (medium custody), which means that he has freedom to move within the prison except for head counts and lock downs at night. This classification allows inmates to leave their cells until the mandatory lockdown at 11 P.M. Prison officials have reported that Parker takes part in play productions put on by inmates, works at arts and crafts, plays guitar and practices yoga. Tulloch is held in the same prison (after beginning his sentence at the Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility in Berlin). He is a Custody Level 3 (medium custody). He eats meals in the same chow hall at the same time as Parker. Their contact is reported as minimal. Tulloch eligible for judicial review for re-sentencing In 2012 the US Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama that mandatory sentencing to life imprisonment without parole of persons who committed a crime as juveniles was unconstitutional. It ruled that this decision needed to be applied retroactively, with cases to be reviewed of persons sentenced to LWOP for crimes committed as juveniles. Their ruling was based on scientific studies that have shown conclusively that juvenile brains are still unformed. The high court based their decision on the basis that juvenile offenders have “diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform” and judges should be able to consider the “mitigating qualities of youth” in sentencing. The court ruled that juveniles cannot be tried and sentenced as adults.Peter Schworm and John R. Ellement, \\"Dartmouth professors’ murderer to get new sentence\\", Boston Globe, August 29, 2014; accessed March 13, 2017 In August 2014, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that Tulloch's case would be among four to be reviewed by the court for re- sentencing. The initial review had been appealed by the state attorney general. Parker is not affected by this ruling because he was not charged with first-degree murder, an adult charge that carries a mandatory LWOP sentence.Bruce Wright, \\"Convicts Who Killed as Juveniles to be Re-sentenced, New Hampshire Court Rules\\", Boston.com, August 29, 2014; accessed March 13, 2017 After review of different factors in the case, the court could re- sentence Tulloch to life imprisonment without parole.

She recognized that more women were moving into the working world, and she provided a service to them that allowed women reproductive independence. On another note, she broke the law, and was arrested.

(1986) The British Ethical Societies, Cambridge University Press, [online] Available from: https://books.google.com/books?id=mqgsFS_MN9UC&pgis;=1 (Accessed 13 May 2014). the Rainbow Circle, the Theosophical Society, the International Arbitration and Peace Association and the International Arbitration League. From 1907 until 1922, Burrows was Appointed Lecturer to the South Place Ethical Society, now Conway Hall Ethical Society. Burrows stood for Parliament unsuccessfully in the 1908 Haggerston by-election, and again in Haggerston in 1910. Disillusioned by his poor performance and the SDF's apparent commitment to militarism, he resigned from the organisation in 1911.

The band name means \\"Muscle Girl Band\\" in Japanese. They became very popular in the late 1980s through the late 1990s. In 1999 they disbanded, but then in 2006 they regrouped. History = Independent years = In 1979 when Vocalist Kenji Ōtsuki and Bassist Yūichirō Uchida were Junior High School students, they started the band called \\"Dotechins\\" (This name was from Kenji Ōtsuki's Junior High School nickname) and this band was a precursor of Kinniku Shōjo Tai. In February 1982 after they disbanded Dotechins and became high school students, they started a new band, \\"Kinniku Shōnen Shōjo Tai\\". On April 6 the same year, they debuted in the independent music scene, and changed the band name to \\"Kinniku Shōjo Tai\\". In March 1986, the original keyboardist Edozō Mishiba joined the band, and this year the band has gotten a high ability and evaluation. In 1987 they released the EP called, \\"Takagi Boo Densetsu\\" (Legend of Takagi Boo) from Nagomu Record (this independent record label is owned by Uchōten vocalist Keralino Sandorovich). This EP caused some trouble with Takagi Boo’s office and the EP was then recalled. =Major debut= In 1988, they successfully made a deal with TOY'S FACTORY and later that year in June they released their 1st album, \\"Buddha L\\" and their 1st single, \\"Shaka\\". But the band lineup was still not established. In 1989, Edozō Mishiba left the band and current guitarist Toshiaki Honjō and Fumihiko Kitsutaka joined the band. Then they released their 3rd Album called \\"Neko no Tebukuro (Cat's Glove) \\". After this, the band lineup became established and has not changed until they disbanded in 1999. This year the band became very popular in Japan. =Disband= The band was going smoothly, but in July 1998 drummer Akira Ōta left the band. After a concert in 1999, guitarist Fumihiko Kitsutaka left the band for an administrative reason. Also leader and vocalist Kenji Ōtsuki left the band taking full responsibility for Fumihiko Kitsutaka leaving the band. And finally the band was completely finished. After disbanding, Kenji Ōtsuki formed a new band called \\"Tokusatsu\\" and Fumihiko Kitsutaka joined a band called \\"X.Y.Z.→A\\". =Regroup= After disbanding the former band members had a few misunderstandings but finally most members became reconciled. And on December 28, 2006, Kenji Ōtsuki, Yūichirō Uchida, Toshiaki Honjō, and Fumihiko Kitsutaka announced that \\"Kinniku Shōjo Tai will regroup\\". Right now they are doing many concerts in Japan. They covered hide's song \\"Dice\\" for Tribute VII -Rock Spirits-, released on December 18, 2013.

Whelan's legal career included clerking for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and serving as a deputy assistant attorney general during the George W. Bush administration. Since 2004, he has served as the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank \\"dedicated to applying the Judeo-Christian moral tradition to critical issues of public policy\\".  Early life and education  Whelan was born in Los Angeles, California, to attorney Martin Edward Whelan II and Nancy Carolyn Mispagel.Los Angeles Times, Daily Pilot, September 2015, Obituary of Martin Edward Whelan II Whelan graduated with honors from Harvard University in 1981 and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. In 1985, he earned a J.D. degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School and also was on the Board of Editors of the Harvard Law Review.  Career  From 1985 until 1986, Whelan worked as a law clerk to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Judge J. Clifford Wallace. From 1991 until 1992, Whelan worked as a law clerk to United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. His co-clerks included Judge Jeffrey Sutton and Judge Daniel P. Collins. In the 1990s, Whelan served as general counsel to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary while it was controlled by Republicans. He also has worked as a lawyer in private practice and was Senior Vice President and Counselor to the General Counsel for Verizon Corporation. From 2001 until 2004, Whelan served as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, advising the White House Counsel's Office, the Attorney General and other senior DOJ officials, and Departments and agencies throughout the executive branch on difficult and sensitive legal questions. In 2004, Whelan became president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit think tank that is based in Washington, D.C. He directs the EPPC's program on the United States Constitution, federal courts and culture. In 2016, Whelan gave his opinion in an interview reported by The New York Times. Whelan asked conservatives to adopt an uncompromising stance on appointments to the upper ranks of the U.S. judiciary, including appeals courts (which give the last word on cases the U.S. Supreme Court declines to review, and which can serve as a \\"breeding ground\\" for future Supreme Court justices). Kavanaugh nomination In 2018, Whelan helped advise his close friend Brett Kavanaugh, a federal judge, in the latter's nomination effort to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. On September 16, Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California, accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting and attempting to rape her in the early 1980s when they were teenagers. Whelan drew considerable criticism when he attempted to defend Kavanaugh, then involved in contentious hearings following his nomination to the Supreme Court. Shortly before a scheduled Judiciary Committee vote on the nomination, an allegation emerged that Kavanaugh had committed a sexual assault as a teen. With assistance and information supplied from Creative Response Concepts Public Relations, a conservative public relations firm, Whelan tweeted that the alleged victim's allegation against Kavanaugh may have been a case of mistaken identity. Whelan went so far as to name a private citizen publicly who he indicated was a doppelganger of Kavanaugh and the real sexual assaulter. After facing ridicule for his reasoning and criticism for what was regarded as a baseless smear of a private citizen, he apologized a day later for an \\"appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment.\\"Kavanaugh accuser won’t testify Monday but open to doing so later next week  Blogging  In May 2005, Whelan began blogging at the National Review's website. In June 2009, Whelan sparked a controversy in the blogosphere when he publicly divulged the name of a pseudonymous legal blogger in a post entitled \\"Exposing an Irresponsible Anonymous blogger\\". Whelan apologized to the blogger for the disclosure, and the blogger accepted Whelan's apology.  Books  Whelan is also the co-editor of three volumes of Justice Antonin Scalia's work: Scalia Speaks: Reflections on Law, Faith, and Life Well Lived, a New York Times bestselling collection of speeches by Justice Scalia; On Faith: Lessons From an American Believer, a collection of Justice Scalia's writings on faith and religion; and The Essential Scalia: On the Constitution, the Courts, and the Rule of Law, a collection that highlights Justice Scalia's jurisprudence. The works have been critically acclaimed. Each has featured a foreword from one of Justice Scalia's former colleagues on the Supreme Court including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Elena Kagan.

Although it has the word \\"international\\" in its name, it is not an international school per se; rather, it is a French school that offers a regular French curriculum taught in French, while also offering supplemental language and history curricula available in German, English, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. Its lycée (high school) has a consistently high pass rate for the French baccalaureate, due in part to its strict admissions procedures, including a rigorous language test conducted in either 6ème for entry to collège, or 2nd for entry to lycée (sixth and tenth grades, respectively). Entry to other grades is possible, though only for children arriving in Grenoble during the summer, and once again a rigorous language test is used to evaluate pupils and to make selections where necessary. The school was created as a response to the high influx of international residents to Grenoble and was originally located in several school facilities throughout the Grenoble area (for example, the English section was in the Lycée Stendhal). However, all language sections were moved by design to the new facility in the Europole neighborhood in the fall of 2001. Europole provides an environment in which its students are able to receive an additional six to eight hours of intensive instruction in grammar, literature, and history in one of the above-mentioned languages, in addition to following a regular French secondary school education. Students have the possibility of graduating with a French OIB (\\"option internationale du baccalauréat\\") in any of the six languages offered. (The OIB is not the same as a regular international baccalaureate [IB] degree, but is rather a supplement to the regular French Baccalauréat, which Europole students can earn in Literature, Economics, or Science.) Some language sections also offer the possibility of receiving equivalent academic recognition from other countries, as for example, the German or the Italian sections. In addition to rigorous academics, Europole enjoys a copious number of partnerships with schools around the world with which it conducts exchanges, notably in Australia, Germany, the UK, and Spain. The American School of Grenoble (formerly the Marshall McLuhan American School) is also housed at Europole, and allows short-stay Anglophone students (generally of American origin) to continue to follow many subjects, notably math and science, according to the same content and methodology as found in the United States. Languages in the International Sections (in alphabetical order) * Arabic ; * English ; * German ; * Italian ; * Portuguese; * Spanish; * French. Admissions Pupils already living in the Grenoble area are considered for admission to CSI at only two points: 6ème, or 2nd. These are the first years of collège and lycée respectively. Entry is based on a dossier detailing the pupil's prior educational results, as well as on oral and written tests including tests in the language of the desired section. These entrance tests take place in May each year. For those coming to Grenoble during the summer the situation is different. They can be considered for entry in their current year, to the extent that there are places available in the desired section. Once again entry is based on a dossier detailing the pupil's prior educational results, as well as on oral and written tests which may also include tests in French and Mathematics for those who have been schooled outside France for more than a year. These tests take place in September, as soon as school resumes after the summer break, with an extremely short schedule typically involving tests one day, results at the end of the following day, and first meetings at the school the day after that. Note that a pupil in the collège at CSI is not guaranteed automatic entry to the lycée. All pupils in 3ème wishing to continue to the lycée the following year are obliged to sit the same selection tests as those wishing to transfer to the lycée from other schools. Their level of competence in the language of their section is an important factor in this decision. In 2009 approximately 2/3 of the entrants to 2nd came from collège at CSI, while 1/3 of entrants were external candidates.

The Court held that the capture of fishing vessels as prizes of war violated customary international law, which is integrated with U.S. law and binding as such.John O. McGinnis and Ilya Somin, \\"Should International Law Be Part of Our Law?\\" Stanford Law Review at 59 STAN. L.

(1985) \\"The Paquete Habana: A Case History in the Development of International Law,\\" University of Baltimore Law Review: Vol. 15: Iss. 1, Article 2. Available at: http://scholarworks.law.ubalt.edu/ublr/vol15/iss1/2 The case is also notable for citing a wide breadth of historical and international sources, including jurists from around the world and foreign state practices going back centuries. Background of the case In April 1898, two fishing vessels, the Paquete Habana and the Lola, separately sailed from the Spanish colony of Cuba. Both were eventually captured by merchant vessels comprising the United States blockade of the island, which, unbeknownst to the crew, had been instituted amid rising tensions between the two countries. President William McKinley proclaimed that the blockade was \\"in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and the law of nations applicable to such cases.\\" Shortly thereafter, the Spanish–American War was officially declared, and McKinley issued another proclamation stating that the war would be conducted \\"in harmony with the present views of nations and sanctioned by their recent practice\\" and establishing rules for the capture of prizes; however, there was no mention of fishing vessels. The Paquete Habana and the Lola were ultimately taken to Key West, Florida, where they were auctioned by the federal district court, which has jurisdiction over prize cases. Admiral William T. Sampson, who commanded the blockade, justified the seizures by stating that most fishing vessels flying under the Spanish banner were manned by well trained seamen with prior naval experience who could be called up to fight for Spain. The U.S. also relied on the longstanding international practice of capturing enemy vessels as prizes of war. The owners of the vessels appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing a centuries-long tradition of nations exempting fishing vessels from prize capture, even during war. At the time of capture, neither vessel had evidence of aiding the enemy, no arms were found on board, and no attempts were made to either run the blockade or resist capture. Pointing to McKinley's proclamation that the blockade conformed with international law, the claimants thus argued that the blockade should not have captured the vessels as prizes. On appeal, the U.S. government argued that it had complied with international law, under which there was precedence for the executive of a nation, through his military commanders, to exercise discretion as to whether there was an exemption of fishing vessels from prize capture. Notably, the government never contested that it must abide by international law. Both parties in the case were invoking customary international law—the prevailing and long-running practices and norms that are observed and accepted by most countries as obligations—but differed as to what it permitted with respect to prizes. Decision In a 6-3 decision authored by Justice Gray, the Supreme Court ruled that coastal fishing vessels are exempt from capture as prizes of war under customary international law, which, barring a \\"controlling executive or judicial decision,\\" must be incorporated into the corpus of U.S. law. The Court cited lengthy legal precedents in support of this conclusion, which it described as an \\"ancient usage among civilized nations, beginning centuries ago, and gradually ripening into a rule of international law.\\" In 1403, King Henry IV of England decreed his officers leave fisherman alone during times of war. He then signed a treaty with France reaffirming this act between both parties. Similarly, in 1521, a treaty between Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire and Francis I of France exempted fishing vessels from capture, on the basis that both nations would face widespread hunger if fishermen did not feel safe to set sail. Justice Gray also relied on the theories and opinions of contemporary jurists and commentators from across the world to buttress the Court's reasoning, decades before such scholarly legal work would be codified as a primary source of international law: > [A]t the present day, by the general consent of the civilized nations of the > world, and independently of any express treaty or other public act, it is an > established rule of international law, founded on considerations of > humanity. . . and of the mutual convenience of belligerent states, that > coast fishing vessels, with their implements and supplies, cargoes and > crews, unarmed and honestly pursuing their peaceful calling of catching and > bringing in fresh fish, are exempt from capture as prize of war. Among the most oft-cited and famous quotes of the decision concerned the relationship of international law to domestic U.S. law: > International law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and > administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction as often > as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for their > determination. For this purpose, where there is no treaty and no controlling > executive or legislative act or judicial decision, resort must be had to the > customs and usages of civilized nations, and, as evidence of these, to the > works of jurists and commentators who by years of labor, research, and > experience have made themselves peculiarly well acquainted with the subjects > of which they treat. Such works are resorted to by judicial tribunals, not > for the speculations of their authors concerning what the law ought to be, > but for trustworthy evidence of what the law really is.Eric George Reeves, > United States V. Ja Vino: Reconsidering The Relationship Of Customary > International Law To Domestic Law, 50 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 877 (1993), > https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/wlulr/vol50/iss2/17 The Supreme Court decision reversed the district court and ordered that the proceeds of the auctions, as well as any profits made from the vessels' cargo, be restored to the claimants \\"with damages and costs.\\" =Fuller's dissent= Justice Fuller delivered a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Harlan and McKenna. Fuller essentially agreed with the federal government's position, arguing that the capture of fishing vessels as prizes was both in accordance with customary international law and militarily necessarily, and that any exemption is under the discretion of the President as the nation's executive.

The first day schedule was: * Steve Funk and Brooke (6AM-10AM) * Dawn Rossi (10AM-3PM) * Rob Williams (3PM-7PM) * Kevin Smith (7PM-Midnight) * Arnie States (Midnight-6AM) Steve Funk was the first program director of KDOT-FM while Rob Williams acted as the operations manager for all of the stations within the Lotus Reno building. Over the first year, some changes in the line- up occurred, the largest being Steve Funk moving to afternoons and Rob Williams taking over the morning drive shift (a slot he had previously done under \\"KHIT-FM\\"). Brooke left the station soon after and was replaced with Arnie States, making this the early version of what would later become a very successful morning team, \\"The Rob, Arnie, and Dawn Show\\". Martina Davis replaced Arnie States on the overnight shift, and this day is the longest continuous running DJ on the air at KDOT-FM. Earlier use of KDOT call letters From 1957 to 1962, the call letters KDOT were used by an AM station in Reno, Nevada, broadcasting on 1230 KHz.http://analieninsouthreno.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-reader-shares-memories- of-reno.html That station went \\"dark\\" (off the air) in late 1962. The following year, new owners received approval to use the call letters KCBN, and the station returned to the air on October 30, 1963. Since September 13, 2019, that station has used the call letters KZTQ. In 1964, the call letters KDOT were assigned to an AM radio station in Scottsdale, Arizona, broadcasting on 1440 KHz. Sister station KDOT-FM launched on August 1, 1969, airing a Beautiful music easy listening format until March 31, 1978. The studios of both stations were located in the \\"beautiful Safari resort.\\" Since February 5, 1986, the FM station in Scottsdale has used the call letters KSLX. Controversy On May 28, 2009, Hosts Rob Williams and Arnie States from \\"The Rob, Arnie, and Dawn Show\\" drew media attention by advocating violence against LGBT children during their show, in reference to two recent news stories regarding transgender children. States said, \\"God forbid if my son put on a pair of high heels, I would probably hit him with one of my shoes\\". Williams and States took turns referring to gender dysphoric children as \\"idiots\\" and \\"freaks,\\" who were just out \\"for attention\\" and had \\"a mental disorder that just needs to somehow be gotten out of them,\\" either by verbal abuse on the part of the parents, or even shock therapy. In response, several advertisers (including Snapple, Sonic, Carl's Jr, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Verizon, Chipotle Grill, AT&T;, and McDonald's) pulled their advertising from KRXQ. Nissan similarly declined to renew an advertising contract with the station. On June 8, 2009, GLAAD announced that the show would issue an apology during a special broadcast including a transgender person. On 20 March 2014, KDOT debuted Cackle-Free Thursdays.How and why is this controversial?

She became a founder member of the Independent Labour Party in 1893. Early years Glasier was born in Stoke Newington as Katharine St John Conway, the second of seven children.At her father's insistence her middle name was pronounced Saint John not Sin-jən. See Lawrence Thompson, The Enthusiasts: A Biography of John & Katharine Bruce Glasier. London: Victor Gollancz, 1971; p. 59. Her elder brother was Robert Seymour Conway, a classical scholar and comparative philologist. Their father, Samuel Conway, was a Congregationalist minister based at Chipping Ongar, Essex; his wife, Amy (née Curling) came from a well-off family from Stoke Newington. The family moved to Walthamstow while Katharine was young. She attended Hackney High School for Girls and then studied classics at Newnham College, Cambridge with a scholarship, graduating with a second-class degree.Thompson, The Enthusiasts, pp. 61–63. Despite the practice at Cambridge University in not awarding degrees to women at that time, she appended the usual BA to her name.Thompson, The Enthusiasts, p. 63. Life and career Conway became a teacher at Redland High School in Bristol, where she was inspired to join the Bristol Socialist Society after seeing a demonstration by striking female cotton workers. She quit her job to become a teacher at a board school in Bristol and moved in with Dan Irving, where she also had to care for his wife. At this time she joined the Fabian Society.Thompson, The Enthusiasts, pp. 70–71. She began lecturing for the organisation, and in 1893 became a founding member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). She was one of the 15 members and the only woman elected to the ILP's first National Administrative Council in January 1893.Thompson, The Enthusiasts, p. 96. She married John Bruce Glasier, a Scottish socialist politician, on 21 June 1893, but she continued to undertake lecture tours.Thompson, The Enthusiasts, p. 83. They had three children: Jeannie, Malcolm, and John Glendower (known as Glen). In the early years of the 20th century, Glasier wrote for a number of publications. She published three novels – Husband and Brother (1894), Aimee Furniss, Scholar (1896), and Marget (1902–3) – and a collection of short stories, Tales from the Derbyshire Hills (1907). She remained prominent in the ILP and in 1916 took over from Fenner Brockway as editor of its newspaper, the Labour Leader. Initially a highly successful editor who increased the circulation, disputes about her support for the Bolsheviks led to a decline in sales.Thompson, The Enthusiasts, p. 230. However, her husband was terminally ill and died in 1920 and she suffered a nervous breakdown in April 1921, resigning the editorship of The Leader, which was taken over by H. N. Brailsford. In the 1920s, Glasier joined the Society of Friends and the Theosophical Society. She became the ILP's National Organiser, but resigned in 1931 when the ILP left the Labour Party, continuing to work for the Labour Party, after a brief flirtation with the Socialist League.Thompson, The Enthusiasts, pp. 237–238. In 1948 she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Price by Labour MP Gilbert McAllister for her \\"humanitarian work in England and elsewhere\\". Death and legacy Katharine Glasier moved to Glen Cottage in Earby, Lancashire in 1922 and remained there until her death in 1950.Thompson, The Enthusiasts, p. 243. Her younger son, Glen, predeceased her in 1928. After her death, Glen Cottage was donated to the Youth Hostels Association for use as a hostel. It has remained as such, although the building is now owned by Pendle Borough Council. Among her achievements were the introduction of pit- head baths in England, the founding of the Margaret McMillan Memorial College in Bradford, and work for the Save the Children Fund.Thompson, The Enthusiasts, pp. 240–241. The Metropolitan Borough of Islington named after her in 1939 a block of apartments in Hazellville Road, London.

It belongs to the genus Sepia. It lives in very shallow water to a depth of 3 m.Reid, A., P. Jereb, & C.F.E. Roper 2005. Family Sepiidae. In: P. Jereb & C.F.E. Roper, eds. Cephalopods of the world.

FAO Species Catalogue for Fishery Purposes. No. 4, Vol. 1. Rome, FAO. pp. 57–152. It is endemic. The type specimen was collected off the coast of South Africa and is deposited at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris.Current Classification of Recent Cephalopoda Description Sepia tuberculata grows to a mantle length of 82 mm. The upper surface of the body is rough with variably extending bumps. The lower body surface has two glandular patches. Like all cuttlefish, this species has ten arms, of which two are elongated tentacles used for catching prey. It has narrow fins which extend the length of the body.Roeleveld, M.A. 1972. A review of the Sepiidae (Cephalopoda) of southern Africa. Ann. S. Afr. Mus. 59(10): 193–313. Ecology S. tuberculata is capable of changing colour rapidly. It feeds on shrimps. It uses its glandular patches to cling to rocks. = Threats = It is the prey of the Cape Clawless Otter – an opportunistic mammal that is adept at capturing available prey. It is often caught in the Tsitsikama Coastal National Park in South Africa. It is part of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species however it is considered “data deficient” since there is very little published information on the species and thus cannot be put into a Red List Category. A huge threat to Sepia tuberculata, as well as many other Cephalopods, is ocean acidification due to anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Changes in the 33chemistry of seawater has been found to increase calcification rates in a relative of S. tuberculata, S. officinalis. Increased calcification in the cuttlebone has a negative impact in that it affects the cuttlebone’s function as a lightweight, buoyancy structure in cuttlefish. Cuttlefish have made a lot of the earnings for several fisheries in the English Channel however it is unknown if S. tuberculata is of interest to fisheries in South Africa. = Prey = Not much is known about specific prey preference S. tuberculata, but the common cuttlefish is known to feed on shrimp. This exhibition of food preference is shown very early in life for cuttlefish and suggests that choosing to prey on shrimp is an innate behavior.  Adaptations  Much of the research published about Sepia tuberculata has been concerning the topic of adhesion. Adhesion is a common occurrence that is used by many plants and animals including Cephalopods, the class to which all Cuttlefish belong. It is effectively bonding, or how plants and animals hold onto substrates. Adhesion, for Cephalopods, typically happens by means of a pressure system that includes use of the suckers on their and tentacles. Sepia are one taxa of cephalopods that produce a chemical substance to be used for adhesion; the use of this secretion varies depending on each specific animal. In addition, S. tuberculata is one of at least four Sepia species that actually possesses an adhesive structure. No information has been published on whether or not S. tuberculata has the ability to change colors/produce patterns on its body, but the common cuttlefish, S. officinalis, possesses the ability to produce 13 different body patterns composed of a number of different chromatic, textural, postural and locomotor components in its body. The changing of body patterns is primarily used for concealment, and specific patterns are chosen depending on the strategy the cuttlefish intends to use be that disruptive coloration or general color resemblance .

She has also achieved wide recognition as a writer, broadcaster and actress. Biography The daughter of Mary and Alexander Gartshore, Brown was brought up in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Brown was educated at Coatbridge High School, Hamilton College and the Open University which awarded her an Honours degree in 1978 and a Masters in Education in 1996. She has worked as a primary school deputy headteacher and as a senior lecturer. She now runs her own business, Potential Plus, providing personnel training for companies and organisations. She has been married to her husband, Ronnie, for many years. They live in Edinburgh and have a son, a daughter and three grandchildren. As well as campaigning against child sexual abuse, Brown has run a helpline for victims of workplace bullying in Scotland.  Moira McCall Anderson  Brown has believed, for many years, that, in February 1957, her bus driver father, an alleged philanderer and paedophile, participated in the abduction and murder of a missing local schoolchild, Moira McCall Anderson. She campaigned to bring her father to justice, but her efforts were thwarted in 2006, when he died. = Moira Anderson Foundation = In memory of the missing child, she spearheaded in 2000 the founding of a charitable organisation, the Moira Anderson Foundation (MAF). Since its inception the Foundation has assisted more than 500 families who have been afflicted by child sexual abuse, violence, bullying and related problems. Despite research by Brown and others, Moira McCall Anderson's disappearance remains unsolved. On 23 February 2007, the fiftieth anniversary of her disappearance, a memorial service was held for Moira at Airdrie Baptist Church, Lanarkshire. The service also commemorated other missing people and victims of child sexual abuse.  Media appearances  Now prominent as a spokesperson on child protection issues, Brown makes frequent appearances in the Scottish newspapers and in the UK media. Notable broadcasts on BBC Radio Four include The Choice (radio series) (interviewed by Michael Buerk) and Woman's Hour (interviewed by Martha Kearney). The unsolved case of Moira McCall Anderson has been the subject of three television documentaries - Cutting Edge and Unsolved, and the Zone Reality Show Psychic Private Eyes. Writings = One Of Our Ain = Brown has written a theatre play, recounting her childhood and the unexplained disappearance of the schoolchild - One Of Our Ain. This one-woman show, presented by Brown herself, has been staged at the Soho Theatre, London, Oran Mor Theatre, Glasgow and during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2006. = Where There Is Evil = Brown has written a best-selling book about her Lanarkshire childhood and the mystery of the schoolchild's disappearance - Where There Is Evil (Pan Macmillan Ltd, ). The book has sold over 100,000 copies internationally, and ensures that the missing child's memory remains vivid in the public imagination. It also highlights the need for on-going vigilance and wider awareness of child protection issues. As of June 2013, Brown is co-writing a feature film screenplay adaptation of her life story & book, Where There Is Evil, with London screenwriter, Amanda Duke.  Awards  * In 2002, Brown was voted runner-up Scottish Citizen of the Year, by readers of The Scotsman newspaper. * In 2005, Brown was voted Scotswoman of the Year by readers of the Glasgow Evening Times. * In December 2006, Brown was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for services to child protection.
