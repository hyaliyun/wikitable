The house and demesne were dominant features in the rural landscape of Ireland, throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Location often reflected the distribution of better land, and this is evidenced in mid-Cork, where many of these houses are situated along the valley of the River Lee and its tributaries. The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage describes it as a detached, seven-bay, three-storey country house, built c. 1740, and having a central pedimented three-bay breakfront, a canted bay window on its southern side, and a three-bay, two-storey, flat-roofed wing on its northern side with recent extension. A farm complex of single and double-storey buildings lies to the west, having a central pedimented breakfront which reflects the design of the main house. Building continuity is evident, from the eighteenth century to the later north-wing addition of the twentieth century. Historic features include timber sash windows, a Venetian window in the breakfront, and a timber-panelled door. Dripsey Castle forms part of a larger group of demesne structures along the Dripsey River. The Archaeological Inventory of County Cork describes the house as being of late-eighteenth-century appearance, with the central door approached by a flight of stone steps. Dripsey Castle originally dates from the 15th century, when it was commissioned by Cormac McTeige MacCarthy, 9th Lord of Muskerry, who also built Blarney and Kilcrea Castles. It was once the residence of the Colthurst family. Lewis (1837) describes it as 'Dripsey House, the residence of J.H. Colthurst, Esq'. The Ordnance Survey name book (c. 1840) refers both to the 'house and demesne' of Dripsey Castle as a gentleman's seat and to John Henry Colthurst, Esq. The mid-nineteenth-century Primary Valuation of Ireland (Griffith's Valuation) records John H. Colthurst as occupying c. 194 acres in Carrignamuck townland, consisting of a 'house, offices, and land', with the lessor being Margaret Colthurst. Descendants of the Colthurst family occupied Dripsey Castle from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century. John Colthurst of Dripsey Castle married Jane Bowen of Oak Grove, Carrigadrohid, Cork. A grandson of theirs, John Henry, resided at Dripsey Castle and another, George, at Carhue House. Their granddaughter Peggy married Alfred Greer and they were residing at Dripsey Castle during the 1870s, with Greer having purchased part of the Dripsey estate, advertised for sale in October 1851, and comprising over 1900 acres. Their daughter Georgina succeeded to Dripsey Castle, and in 1878 married Robert Walter Travers Bowen, who took the additional name of Colthurst in 1882. It was their son, Captain John Bowen-Colthurst, who ordered the shooting of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington in 1916. He was court-martialled, but successfully pleaded insanity. The family were subsequently boycotted, and ultimately left Dripsey Castle. The O'Shaughnessy family bought the castle in 1922. It was sold in 2015 for ‚Ç¨2m to 'an overseas buyer'. The Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 held Dripsey Castle to be the principal residence in the parish, and built c. 1746 by the Colthurst family. Within the drawing- room was a carved marble mantlepiece, and in the breakfast room a bookcase said to be made from timber originating in Carrigadrohid Castle. Tower in the Dripsey Castle demesne At the entrance gate is a detached, single-storey gate lodge, built c. 1850, and a circular ornamental tower (folly) built c. 1840 having a crenellated parapet and rubble stone walls. Within a wood a short distance to the south is a square tower of roughly same date as the house. Dripsey Castle remains a private residence, and is not accessible to the public, but its gardens are sometimes used for local events.

It has a thriving co-educational Nursery that embeds and fosters learning, preparing children for the main school. Boys continue up to the age of 7 and then take the 7+ tests for entry into boys‚Äô schools or co- educational schools of their choice. Girls continue to Year 6 where they sit the 11+ tests for the top London Independent Schools or Grammar Schools. Harvington Prep School and Nursery is a leading West London prep school and is a noted feeder school of the best London schools including St Paul's Girls School, City of London School for Girls, Latymer, Notting Hill & Ealing High School. The Independent Schools Inspectorate reports that the school secures high levels of academic achievement and excellent personal development for the pupils, within the context of a close-knit, multi-cultural environment. They go on to state that standards are high and progress is rapid in relation to pupils of a similar ability. Full Day fees are ¬£3,995 for Nursery, ¬£4,400 for Transition and ¬£4,700 for years 1 - 6. Scholarships and bursaries are available. History Harvington School opened in 1890 as Heidelberg College, a kindergarten school run by two sisters, Misses Watson. The school was named after the birthplace of Miss Chrystabel Watson‚Äôs mentor, and remained Heidelberg College until the First World War when in 1915 the staff and parents took the decision to rename the school, and Harvington was born. In 1892 a third Watson sister, Miss Florence, had taken over Heidelberg College, making Miss Chrystabel her deputy and moving the school to Castlebar Road, occupying two houses. Miss Flo, as she was known by the girls, was headmistress for an outstanding forty-eight years and was replaced by joint Headmistresses, Miss Emerton and Mrs Turner in 1940. In 1956 after sixteen years, the two Heads retired and in their place Miss Frances Smith took over the school. She remained Head for fourteen years until Miss Joan Nicholson, who had been with Harvington since 1952, became Headmistress in 1970, until 1988. Mrs Anita Fookes became Deputy Head in 1986 and in 1988 made the transition to Headmistress. Mrs Fookes joined the staff in 1979 as a part-time teacher in Speech training and managed to juggle both her job and position as Mayor in 1980. After Mrs Fookes came Dr Faye Meek in 1998 who was Headmistress until 2006 when Mrs Anna Evans took the position to the present day. Mrs Evans began her career as a secondary school English teacher in the state sector where she taught for 12 years. She made the transition to the independent sector and soon rose to senior management within the prep school world. She has taught in three different prep schools in London. Mrs Evans directed and led the development of Harvington School to Harvington Prep School as a result of the local demand for a traditional prep school with high standards, gaining entry for girls to the most prestigious senior schools in London. The School‚Äôs award system has historical connections and currently runs throughout the four houses: Gordon, after Gordon Road where Heidelberg College Kindergarten School was first opened. Duncan, in memory of Nellie Duncan, a pupil who died from typhoid not long after she left school to join her father in Iquique. An English scholarship was started for girls in her name but lapsed during World War Two. Kennedy, in memory of Marjorie Kennedy, a Head Girl at Harvington who achieved her Cambridge Higher Local Certificate in 1911. Finally, Norris named after Phyllis Norris, a pupil at the school who died aged sixteen of tuberculosis in 1912. Her parents donated a scholarship for girls with excellent all-round capabilities. Facilities The school has a wide range of extra-curricular activities and utilises the best in modern technology to enrich the curriculum. Resources include a science laboratory, an impressive art studio, a music room, a drama room, a gymnasium, an ICT suite, a French classroom and two well stocked libraries that are the hub of the school. The school also offers school lunches in a spacious dining room, prepared on site by their chef. Chairman of the school governors Professor Alan Gillett OBE has been a Governor for twenty years and Chairman for thirteen. He was a pupil in the Nursery from 1935 ‚Äì 1937.

Note that the kernel of this map (i.e., G = G(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{F}_q}) \\\\to G(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{F}_q})) is precisely G(\\\\mathbf{F}_q). The theorem implies that H^1(\\\\mathbf{F}_q, G) = H_{\\\\mathrm{\\\\acute{e}t}}^1(\\\\operatorname{Spec}\\\\mathbf{F}_q, G) vanishes,This is \\"unwinding definition\\". Here, H^1(\\\\mathbf{F}_q, G) = H^1(\\\\operatorname{Gal}(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{F}_q}/\\\\mathbf{F}_q), G(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{F}_q})) is Galois cohomology; cf. Milne, Class field theory. and, consequently, any G-bundle on \\\\operatorname{Spec} \\\\mathbf{F}_q is isomorphic to the trivial one. Also, the theorem plays a basic role in the theory of finite groups of Lie type. It is not necessary that G is affine. Thus, the theorem also applies to abelian varieties (e.g., elliptic curves.) In fact, this application was Lang's initial motivation. If G is affine, the Frobenius \\\\sigma may be replaced by any surjective map with finitely many fixed points (see below for the precise statement.) The proof (given below) actually goes through for any \\\\sigma that induces a nilpotent operator on the Lie algebra of G.  The Lang‚ÄìSteinberg theorem  gave a useful improvement to the theorem. Suppose that F is an endomorphism of an algebraic group G. The Lang map is the map from G to G taking g to g‚àí1F(g). The Lang‚ÄìSteinberg theorem states that if F is surjective and has a finite number of fixed points, and G is a connected affine algebraic group over an algebraically closed field, then the Lang map is surjective.  Proof of Lang's theorem  Define: :f_a: G \\\\to G, \\\\quad f_a(x) = x^{-1}a\\\\sigma(x). Then (identifying the tangent space at a with the tangent space at the identity element) we have: :(d f_a)_e = d(h \\\\circ (x \\\\mapsto (x^{-1}, a, \\\\sigma(x))))_e = dh_{(e, a, e)} \\\\circ (-1, 0, d\\\\sigma_e) = -1 + d \\\\sigma_e where h(x, y, z) = xyz. It follows (d f_a)_e is bijective since the differential of the Frobenius \\\\sigma vanishes. Since f_a(bx) = f_{f_a(b)}(x), we also see that (df_a)_b is bijective for any b.This implies that f_a is √©tale. Let X be the closure of the image of f_1. The smooth points of X form an open dense subset; thus, there is some b in G such that f_1(b) is a smooth point of X. Since the tangent space to X at f_1(b) and the tangent space to G at b have the same dimension, it follows that X and G have the same dimension, since G is smooth. Since G is connected, the image of f_1 then contains an open dense subset U of G. Now, given an arbitrary element a in G, by the same reasoning, the image of f_a contains an open dense subset V of G. The intersection U \\\\cap V is then nonempty but then this implies a is in the image of f_1.  Notes   References  *T.A.

It reduces symmetries in the search procedure by means of graph pruning, eliminating certain nodes in the grid based on assumptions that can be made about the current node's neighbors, as long as certain conditions relating to the grid are satisfied. As a result, the algorithm can consider long \\"jumps\\" along straight (horizontal, vertical and diagonal) lines in the grid, rather than the small steps from one grid position to the next that ordinary A* considers. Jump point search preserves A*'s optimality, while potentially reducing its running time by an order of magnitude.  History  Harabor and Grastien's original publication provides algorithms for neighbor pruning and identifying successors. The original algorithm for neighbor pruning allowed corner-cutting to occur, which meant the algorithm could only be used for moving agents with zero width, limiting its application to either real-life agents (e.g. robotics) or simulations (e.g. many games). The authors presented modified pruning rules for applications where corner-cutting is not allowed the following year. This paper also presents an algorithm for pre-processing a grid in order to minimise online search times. A number of further optimizations were published by the authors in 2014. These optimizations include exploring columns or rows of nodes instead of individual nodes, pre-computing \\"jumps\\" on the grid, and stronger pruning rules. Future work Although jump point search is limited to uniform cost grids and homogeneously sized agents, the authors are placing future research into applying JPS with existing grid-based speed-up techniques such as hierarchical grids.

It opened in 2008, as a fully accredited medical facility to respond to a shortage of physicians in the United States and Canada. It has its administrative headquarters in Roswell, Georgia and it partners with Milton Cato Memorial Hospital located in Kingstown and Northwest Hospital in Baltimore. Programs =School of Biomedical Sciences= For students who have not attained the four-semester prerequisite courses for entrance to medical school, the school offers undergraduate programs. The Pre-Medical program provides students with the 90 credit hours of basic medical curriculum for those who have not attained applicable credits from foreign universities. Because criteria vary from nation to nation, students who have earned college level credit previously, are recommended to submit those credits for review to confirm their applicability to Trinity's academic requirements. =School of Medicine= The medical school curriculum is based on the US four-year model, requiring 130 weeks of study. Trinity's program consists of five terms of basic science study followed by five terms of clinical core and elective clerkships. Students successfully completing the ten terms which includes various NBME subject exams and passing the USMLE Steps 1, 2CK, and 2CS are awarded a Doctor of Medicine degree. Because of Trinity's unique relationship with Milton Cato Memorial Hospital, for which Trinity pays an annual fee for the right to collaborate and co-funds a pediatric surgeon for public-sector practice, students are able to begin participation in patient care in the first semester of medical school. In addition to providing care at Milton Cato Hospital, students support the health officers at the district clinics in Calliaqua, the Stubbs Polyclinic in Kingstown and at various health fairs on the island. Clinical clerkships, taking place in years three and four (terms six through ten), are conducted with Trinity faculty and local staff at our network of affiliated hospitals and medical facilities in Baltimore. = Health Science Program = Trinity‚Äôs masters of health sciences degree program is designed for students interested in pursuing medically related professions as well as hospital and business administrative professions. As the growing complexity of healthcare requires an advanced understanding of medicine and healthcare even in its allied professions, Trinity is also adapting to train professionals interested in those areas to provide a similar level of quality care through their own specialized roles that its physician graduates offer.  Service Culture  Trinity Medical Sciences University is actively engaged in local community service, ranging from healthcare outreach under the umbrella of the school through student activities groups (such as Trinity's AMSA and CaMSA chapters) reaching out to local children's homes or charity groups on their own accord. A longstanding relationship with the World Pediatric Project gives high performing 5th term students an opportunity to assist visiting physicians in the field, creating greater exposure to complex medical cases while giving them an opportunity to ask questions and network with prominent North American physicians. Accreditation The Trinity Medical Sciences University was chartered and licensed in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on 11 April 2008 and listed in the FAIMER International Medical Education Directory (IMED), now the World Directory of Medical Schools (WDMS), effective 19 September 2008. By virtue of its listing in the WDMS, students graduating from Trinity are authorized to take part in the United States Medical Licensing Examination three-part examinations. Those who pass the examinations are eligible according to the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates to register for and participate in the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). In July 2015, Trinity Medical Sciences University received CAAM-HP accreditation. In September 2016, CAAM-HP of St. Vincent and the Grenadines was then recognized by the United States Department of Education's NCFMEA. This finding by the US Department of Education means Trinity Medical Sciences University is now eligible to apply to take part in the United States federal student loan program. On March 19, 2015, St. Vincent & the Grenadines formally adopted CAAM-HP as their governing accrediting body for medical education, acceding authority previously held by the NAB. Through this legal decision, as the only CAAM-HP accredited school in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinity Medical Sciences University became the only accredited medical school in the country.

Built about 1769, it is believed to be the oldest surviving house in the town. Historically significant residents include clock mechanism inventor Benjamin Morrill and artist Omer T. Lassonde, a founder of the New Hampshire Art Association. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Given by Lassonde's widow to the New Hampshire Art Association, it is now in private ownership. Description and history The Morrill-Lassonde House is located in southeastern Boscawen, on the east side of King Street (U.S. Route 3, roughly opposite its junction with Berle Drive. It is a 2¬Ω-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior, set well back from the road and overlooking the floodplain of the Merrimack River. Its front fa√ßade is five bays wide, with the entrance at the center, flanked by a Greek Revival surround of pilasters and corniced entablature. The house was built c. 1769 for Rev. Robie Morrill, and is believed to be the oldest surviving structure in Boscawen. It is also thought to occupy the site of the oldest fortification in the town. Morrill's grandson Benjamin invented the wheelbarrow clock movement in this house. In the 20th century the house was owned by artist Omer T. Lassonde, a New Hampshire native who played a leading role in arts organizations in the state from the 1930s to his death in 1980, and cofounded the New Hampshire Art Association. He eventually donated the house, along with his furnishings and studio, to the New Hampshire Art Association.

In 1925, Caton-Thompson and Gardner began the first archaeological survey of the northern Faiyum, where they sought to correlate ancient lake levels with archaeological stratification. They continued working in the Faiyum over the next two years for the Royal Anthropological Institute where they discovered two unknown Neolithic cultures.

The episode was written by Melinda Hsu Taylor and directed by Lance Anderson. Plot Nadia (Olga Fonda) has hallucinations of her past while she was searching for her mother Katherine (Nina Dobrev), after Tyler (Michael Trevino) bit her. Katherine is there for her and tells her that she will not leave her side and that she will find a way to save her life but not by asking Klaus (Joseph Morgan) for help. Instead, she calls Wes (Rick Cosnett) who takes a sample of the werewolf toxin from Nadia's wound and promised to create an antidote. Meanwhile, Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Caroline (Candice Accola) inform everyone that Katherine has taken over Elena's body and they try to find a way to bring Katherine to them before she realizes that she knows. Tyler says that he bit Nadia and they all figure out that Katherine must be with her daughter and that they have to find something that Elena could not say no to. Katherine finds excuses for everything, and the persistence of everyone trying to see her makes her figure out that they have figured out her identity. She tests this by calling Damon (Ian Somerhalder), who falls into her trap and practically begs her to come over to the Salvatore house, which she realizes he would not do to Elena, as the previous day he tried to kill her. Katherine confirms her suspicions but the phone call also makes Stefan realize that she knows that they know. Bonnie (Kat Graham) and Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) go to college to find Liv (Penelope Mitchell) and ask her help. They need her to do a spell to find Katherine's location. Liv agrees to help but her interest on Jeremy makes Bonnie get jealous. Tyler watches over Damon who knows what buttons to push to make him enter the cell. The two of them argue and when Tyler gets close enough, Damon grabs him and feeds on him. Damon gets his strength back, breaks the chains and escapes. Damon heads to find Wes to ask him for the antidote of the ripper virus, but Wes refuses to help him, leading Damon to kill him. Meanwhile, Katherine takes Nadia to a church to keep her safe while waiting for Wes, but because Wes is taking a long time with the cure, Katherine leaves to find him. When she gets to his laboratory, she finds him dead. Stefan calls Katherine revealing her that they know and tells her that they have Nadia at the Salvatore house and if she wants she can run away to survive or come and see her daughter for a last time. Katherine chooses the latter and shows up at the Salvatore house. Everyone is there and they let her in with Nadia to say goodbye. Katherine apologizes to Nadia, tells her that she loves her and Nadia dies happy. Katherine stands and tries to get away but Damon is blocking the door. She seems to accept that there is no way out this time and she asks who has the traveler knife to stab her. She says goodbye to everyone in her own way leaving Stefan last. She kisses him and Stefan stabs her. Katherine collapses and leaves Elena's body. Stefan and Damon watch over Elena waiting for her to wake up. Meanwhile Caroline and Tyler discuss her sleeping with Klaus. Matt takes Nadia's body to bury it despite Stefan's suggestion to throw her in a ditch. Bonnie is praying to her father at a church when Katherine appears, ready to cross over to the other side via Bonnie. Before she does, she takes the time to reveal to Bonnie that she had already accepted her death sentence before showing up at the Salvatore house, but that did not mean she would cooperate. When Katherine went to Wes' laboratory earlier, she found out that Wes never intended to help Nadia. He had instead extracted werewolf venom from Nadia's wound and used it to enhance the ripper virus. Katherine then injected herself with the virus so that when Elena wakes up, she will be doubly infected. The episode ends with Elena waking up to resume her life while Katherine prepares to embark into the afterlife; However when Katherine touches Bonnie nothing happens. She asks Bonnie what is happening but Bonnie does not know. A wind whips up in the church, the doors open and a dark abyss appears. Bonnie says to Katherine that it is not her decision to let her pass to the other side or not and that she cannot help her. Katherine is dragged, screaming, into the darkness. Feature music In the \\"Gone Girl\\" episode we can hear the songs: *\\"White Collar Whiskey\\" by Emily Wolfe *\\"Good Mistake\\" by Mr. Little Jeans Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Gone Girl\\" was watched by 2.19 million; up by 0.16 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Gone Girl\\" received positive reviews. Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave an A- rate to the episode. \\"The Vampire Diaries has a strange relationship with death. People die all of the time‚Äîlargely because they are killed by one of the main characters‚Äîand often these deaths are treated with such blithe disinterest that the death becomes almost startling in its inconsequence. But once in a while, the show remembers the finality of death. And when it does, it always knocks the emotion of it out of the park.\\" Ashley Dominique from Geeked Out Nation gave an A- rate to the episode saying that it \\"marked the loss of one of the Petrova women in a strong send off.\\" Stephanie Flasher of TV After Dark gave a B+ rate to the episode saying that it was a good one and pointing the pros of it: \\"Nina and Olga's performances were phenomenal; Good story development; Enticing cliffhanger; More character developed with Liv.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.1/5 saying that the episode was extremely well done. \\"We got to hang out with our favorite heroes and heroines and listen to them playfully banter with each other (don't worry, Caroline used a calculator) and not-so-playfully taunt each other (You're a joke, Damon/Says the guy pining for the girl who slept with Klaus.) The Katherine-Nadia farewell was touching, perfectly acted and expertly made viewers feel sympathy for the vampire who was about to finally die.\\" About the ending scene, where Katherine is taken away, Richenthal says that it was awesome the way it was done. Stephanie Hall from KSiteTV gave a good review to the episode saying that it was easily one of the best of the season. \\"A significantly more intriguing and monumental episode than last week, \\"Gone Girl\\" served as an appropriate sendoff for Katherine and appears to have rejuvenated the underdeveloped virus storyline. It contained more heart than plot, which allowed the audience to truly dwell in the drama and absorb every emotion running through the characters.\\" Shannon Vestal from Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that finally, after years of waiting, Katherine is dead. \\"We thought she was going to die a few episodes ago, but this week, she really, truly dies ‚Äî and she has a spectacularly appropriate farewell. [...] Maybe now with Katherine gone, we can move on to new, more exciting things, hopefully!\\" Christopher Monigle of Starpulse gave a good review saying that season five is rounding into form and that \\"Gone Girl\\" is split in two parts. \\"The first half of the episode concerns the plan to corner Katherine and kill her. [...] The first half of the episode is typical TVD fare: planning, bad execution, a brutal murder by Damon. The second half slows down. The writing and acting become thoughtful rather than reactive. TVD executes slow, thoughtful bits very effectively and movingly, and Nadia‚Äôs was very well written and delicately acted.\\" Alyse Wax from Fearnet also gives a good review saying that it was a very enjoyable episode. \\"First off, Damon going Dr. Mengele on Wes was a scene of epic beauty. It was swift, it was violent, it was slick. I would not have minded seeing a little more of Damon‚Äôs ‚Äúplaytime‚Äù with Wes. Katherine going to hell was an obvious choice, but I liked the way they did it. The comedy of her slapping Bonnie‚Äôs shoulders, trying to get it to work, then just getting swallowed up by darkness.\\" Jen from TVovermind says that this was the best episode of the season so far. \\"It was a pretty great episode, raising even more questions. Will this revolving door of recurring characters ever slow down? It seems we no sooner get used to one new face, and suddenly they‚Äôre killed off only to introduce even more new characters.\\" References External links * * Afterbuzz's discussion about \\"Gone Girl\\" on You Tube Category:2014 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 5) episodes ","title":"Gone Girl (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"42147088","text":"iGo, Inc.

The area is distinctive as a cohesive collection of rural properties that were adapted for use as summer estates between 1873 and 1937, the start date representing an early transition from agricultural to tourist use of such properties in the state. The district has eight farmhouses that were adapted, and two Shingle style houses, as well as one 19th-century district schoolhouse that has been repurposed as a meeting space. All are located on Murray Hill Road between Cass Mill Road and Lynch (Dickerson Hill) Road. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Murray Hill Road, located in northwestern Hill, very roughly follows a terrace at an elevation of about on the north side of a ridge whose peaks are Page and Dickinson Hills (elevations and respectively). Remnants of the area's agricultural past survive in the form of abandoned roads and farm tracks, and stone walls which line fields and wooded areas. In 1873 John Murdock began buying up land in the area, which he subdivided for the development of summer houses. Land was typically transferred between family members and friends. By the time the state was involved in organized attempts to adapt abandoned farms for the summer tourist trade, the Murray Hill area had for the most part already been transformed. One typical property is the Chandler property, which includes a farmhouse built c. 1810, and operated primarily as a farm until 1878. The owners then began taking in summer boarders to supplement declining farm income. The Chandlers acquired the property in 1927, and began a series of modifications to adapt it as a summer property.

Seers didn't speak until she was seven years old after the family's departure from the island. During this time her mother claims her daughter possessed an eidetic memory (otherwise known as photographic memory) so vivid that she felt no need for verbal communication. She first spoke after seeing a photographic portrait of herself, which prompted her to ask \\"is that me?\\" Upon learning to speak she seems to have lost her ability of eidetic recall, and by the age of nine she became obsessively interested in photography. Seers found comfort behind the lens of the camera and used photography to recapture the immediacy of sensation that she enjoyed in the images of her eidetic memory. Issues of memory continued to haunt her work particularly after the loss of her step-sister Christine Parkes with whom she often collaborated. Christine was involved in a moped accident in 2001M.

She studied at the Slade School of Fine Art (BA Hons, Sculpture and Media 1991‚Äì94) and at Goldsmiths College (MA Fine Art 1999‚Äì2001).  Work  Seers' early fascination with photography led to a project of internalising the technology of the camera, in which she used her own body to produce photographs. The cavity of her mouth became the camera body and her lips became the camera aperture and shutter. This procedure entailed covering herself with a black lightproof sack, positioning a small piece of light-sensitive paper in the back of her mouth and then placing a gum-shield with a small pin-hole incision in front of it. In the moment of capture she closed her lips or placed a hand over her mouth to make the exposure before returning into the sack to develop the image. The resultant images from this project appear framed by her teeth, stained with saliva and tinged red by the blood within her cheeks.

The five story granite building was built in 1926-27 for what is now the oldest bank in the city, and was the only bank building built in the city in the first half of the 20th century. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. New Hampshire Savings Bank was founded in 1830, as the fourth in the state and third in the city. It first occupied part of the Merrimack County Bank building at 214 North Main Street, followed by Stickney's Block, which stood just south of the Eagle Hotel, roughly across North Main Street from this building. The bank purchased Stickney's in 1885, demolished it, and built the commercial block now on that site. Seeking a larger space in the early 1920s, it purchased a three-story block on this site, demolished it in 1925, and built the present building. Its major design work was done by Joseph D. Leland of Boston, with local support from George W. Griffin. Granite for the building's construction came from the Rattlesnake Hill quarry in West Concord. The building originally had two full-size floors, with U-shaped upper floors; the open U was enclosed in 1986. The lower two floors were at first mainly occupied by a large banking hall, which had a two-story ceiling; offices of the president and bank trustees were located on a mezzanine level.

Composition  Concierto Barroco is a musical mystery, an interpretation of the famous homonymous novel by the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier. A composition which takes us to the early 18th-century Christmas holidays and the Carnival of Venice, to an imaginary surrealistic meeting between Vivaldi, H√§ndel, Domenico Scarlatti, and an unnamed Mexican nobleman, along with his servant Felomeno and the ghosts of Wagner and Stravinsky. This peculiar acoustic space is a play of interweaving ornaments, details, gestures, images and voices, floating somewhere between the waters of Tenochtitlan, the silver glimmerings of Taxco and the boundless expanses of the Venetian channels, halls, galleries, graveyards and tiny streets, populated with the never failing wealth of colours, aromas, shadows and rhymes, silhouettes and clamour, forming a complex, ever-changing sound fabric, games of instrumental passages, variations and quasi quotations of unnamed manuscripts from Spanish monasteries, old late-gothic or renaissance masters, the way that I heard and translated them in the meaning of one infinite sound palimpsest.

She was close friends with Stephen Glanville, the Edwards Professor of Egyptology at UCL, whose wife Ethel had been at school with her. Lafleur became part of Glanville's new programme of curatorial, cataloguing and conservation work in the Petrie Museum.H. S. Smith (1988), 'The reopening of the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology', The EES Newsletter No. 3 October 1988: 3 In 1935 she started to work in the museum as a general assistant and also began conservation training at the British Museum. Soon afterwards she began conservation work on the museum objects. She also accompanied Glanville on his 1936 autumn visit to Egypt and attended excavations at El-Amarna and Armant.Janssen, 1992: 33 In 1939 Lafleur became 'Honorary Museum Assistant' and was responsible for photography in the museum, giving six lectures on object conservation. In 1939 Lafleur examined and restored the remains of Jeremy Bentham, along with his clothes, chair and stick. She was responsible for cleaning and preserving his clothes and padding the skeleton so that he could be displayed in the Cloisters of the Wilkins Building at UCL.David Collings (2000) 'Bentham's auto-icon: Utilitarianism and the evisceration of the common body', Prose Studies: History, Theory, Criticism, 23:3: 121 On the outbreak of the Second World War Lafleur managed the removal of the Petrie Museum collections to Stanstead Bury, near Ware in Hertfordshire. She had only the assistance of the college porters and occasional help from former students for this task.Janssen, 1992: 44 After the UCL campus had been hit by bombs in September 1940 and early 1941, she oversaw a continuous salvage programme for the remaining objects and carried out conservation work in the physiology laboratories. Lafleur packed up the remainder of the collections and sent them to safety during the war, effectively rescuing the museum. She had lost her own flat and most of her belongings during the Blitz in 1940. Lafleur's dedication and work for the museum was recognised in 1951 by Sir David Pye, the Provost, at a Fellows' Dinner where a wish was recorded for a permanent record to her in the Petrie Museum, although no such record was ever made. Lafleur continued preserving the collection when it returned to UCL after the end of the war and continued teaching there until 1954. Rosalind Janssen dedicated her book The First Hundred Years: Egyptology at University College London 1892-1992 to the memory of Violette Lafleur as there was no record of her work in the Petrie Museum.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and removed from the register in 2002. Alice French  Born in Andover, Massachusetts, Alice French was five when her family moved to Davenport, Iowa in 1855. She became the first writer from Iowa with a national reputation. Her first short story appeared in a local newspaper in 1871 and by the 1880s she was being published in The Atlantic and Harper‚Äôs. She wrote under the pen name Octave Thanet and her stories became popular in the 1890s and early 1900s. French, along with her widowed friend Jane Allen Crawford, spent their winters at Clover Bend Plantation in Lawrence County, Arkansas from 1883-1909. French expanded on the regionalist themes she started in Iowa with stories about the people in the Clover Bend area. She used the poor black and white sharecroppers as the subjects for her stories. As literary tastes changed French's work fell out of favor. She abandoned writing and took up social work. She died in Davenport in 1934. Thanford French and Crawford originally lived in a cabin on the plantation. It was destroyed in a fire in 1895 and they built Thanford in 1896 along the Black River. It was a three-story, fifteen room house, and its name is a combination of Alice French's (Thanet, from her pen name) and June Allen Crawford's last names. The estate was landscaped with shrubs imported from England. The stables housed fine horses and an elegant carriage. The house was the setting for their literary and social activities. French's study was on the top floor of the house, where she had a commanding view of the river. They entertained many well known people, including Theodore Roosevelt, with fine dining and wines. French also created a woodworking shop, where she built shelves and simple furniture, and a darkroom, where she developed and printed her own photographs.

It was released theatrically and through VOD formats by Lionsgate on December 5, 2014.https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=123848 The film received extremely negative reviews, with controversy surrounding the heavy tampering and reediting of the footage by the studio, who denied Schrader final-cut privilege and led him and principal members of the cast to disown the released version and campaign against it.Paul Schrader, Nicolas Winding Refn & Nicolas Cage Campaign Against Their Film 'Dying Of The Light' Oct 16, 2014 - IndieWire Plot Evan Lake (Nicolas Cage) is a highly decorated veteran CIA agent and Intelligence Star recipient reduced to a desk job at Langley with his protege and close friend Milton \\"Milt\\" Schultz (Anton Yelchin). Twenty-two years ago during an op in Africa, Lake was captured by terrorist Muhammad Banir (Alexander Karim) and tortured by having his head repeatedly bashed and having his ear mutilated. During the extraction and ensuing explosion, Banir went missing and was presumed dead, although Lake never believed it and has obsessively tried to find Banir ever since. As a result of the trauma he sustained under torture, Lake is now suffering from early stage frontotemporal dementia, and his boss considers him a liability to the agency. In Bucharest, police tail a Kenyan national, Abdi, carrying a mysterious USB drive. A car chase ensues, and rather than giving himself up, the courier throws himself and the drive off a bridge. The Romanian Intelligence Service retrieve the drive and the body, but the data is corrupted, so it is subsequently sent to the CIA. Milt gets a hit on large quantities of an experimental drug treating thalassemia, information corroborated in the USB data. The drugs are for an anonymous Kenyan client, and are coming from a University of Bucharest clinic run by Professor Dr. Iulian Cornel. Since thalassemia is hereditary, Milt concludes that Banir is ordering shipments of the drug through a middleman, Dr. Wangari. He tells Lake, who asks his superiors to go after Banir. However, they still believe he's dead, and refuse. Later, Lake has a violent outburst during a search and resigns on the spot. During this time, in Kenya, Banir sends his man Aasim to Bucharest to find out why Abdi has not delivered the medicine. Lake tells Milt about his mental deterioration, which becomes increasingly apparent as the film progresses. When Lake decides to go to Romania, Milt goes along. In Bucharest, the men meet Michelle Zubarain (Ir√®ne Jacob), a former journalist, possible agent, and Lake's one-time love, who has information about Cornel providing the drug Banir needs. The trio meet with the professor, compelling him to acknowledge his role and to admit that Banir is forcing him to travel to Kenya. As Lake, Milt, and Michelle leave the professor's office building, Aasim sees them. The next day, the three return to the professor's office in hopes of following whomever the professor meets. They watch until the professor comes outside to meet Aasim, but Aasim spots them and runs. While Lake takes the money, drugs, and passport from the professor in order to impersonate him in Kenya, Milt catches Aasim and slits his throat, effectively preventing him from contacting Banir. Michelle finds a make-up specialist to help Lake transform into the professor, then Lake and Milt fly to Mombasa. The disguise works, and Lake is driven out of the city to Banir's hideout, and through a ruse and some small hand-to-hand combat, is finally alone with Banir. Lake reveals himself to the terrorist, but at that moment has an attack of dementia-fueled flashbacks, during which the disparity between the young terrorist who maimed Lake twenty-two years earlier and the now aging, fragile, and terminally-ill man is very clear. Without taking any further action, Lake abruptly leaves Banir. The next day, Lake and Milt are strolling around their Mombasan hotel's swimming pool and garden, which is full of people, when a shot rings out and a young Kenyan passing Lake suddenly drops. Lake sees that Milt has been hit, too (not fatally), and returns fire to the gunmen, ultimately killing both and being shot twice himself. Understanding that Banir has sent them, he takes their vehicle, driving into the night back to Banir's hideout, where he engages in a short (and prone) knife fight with Banir before killing him. But as he returns to Mombasa, he is still losing blood, and the flashbacks and voices return. Lake appears to drive head-on into a truck. The closing moments of the film move (with a voice-over by Lake) to Arlington National Cemetery, to Langley, to Lake giving a speech (from early in the film), and to Milt giving Michelle a memento of Lake's that is important to her.

On February 15, 2010, Refn left the film project to direct Drive. On June 5, 2013, it was announced that Paul Schrader would direct the film off his own script, with Refn joining on as an executive producer. On July 30, 2013, Nicolas Cage joined the film in the lead role, replacing Ford. On January 10, 2014, Anton Yelchin joined the film, along with Ir√®ne Jacob and Alexander Karim. On March 6, Red Granite International joined as producers. On August 19, it was announced that Lionsgate Home Entertainment had acquired the distribution rights to the film. =Filming= Filming was set to begin on January 27, 2014, to be shot in Romania, including in Castel Film Studios, Bucharest, and wrapped after five weeks followed by post-production to be done in the US. On March 5, 2014, Cage was spotted on the set during the filming of The Dying of the Light in Queensland, Australia. The next day, March 6, it was announced that the shooting in Gold Coast, Queensland had wrapped and the rest of the film would be shot in Romania. = Post-production and controversy = On October 16, 2014, Schrader posted on his Facebook page: \\"We lost the battle. 'Dying of the Light,' a film I wrote and directed, was taken away from me, reedited, scored and mixed without my input.\\" This post was accompanied by photographs of himself, Cage, Yelchin, and Refn wearing a T-shirt carrying the \\"non-disparagement\\" clause of their contracts which prohibits them from criticizing the film in question prior to, during, and in a period immediately following a project's release. Schrader wrote: On December 8, 2014, the film's director of photography, Gabriel Kosuth, explained in a guest column on Variety.com that his color-significant cinematography had been digitally altered and that he \\"was denied the possibility to accomplish in post- production what is any cinematographer's duty: 'assuring that what audiences will see on cinema and television screens faithfully reflects the \\"look\\" intended by the director' (according to the American Cinematographer Manual)\\".  Recreated original cut  In 2017 Schrader revisited his first cut and, working from DVD copies of the workprint, created a rough version of the film that approximates his initial vision under the new title Dark.

The Santuario della Consolata or, in its full name, the Church of the Virgin of the Consolation is a prominent Marian sanctuary and minor basilica in central Turin, Piedmont, Italy. Colloquially, the sanctuary is known as La Consla. It is located on the intersection of Via Consolata and Via Carlo Ignazio Giulio. Altar with icon of the Virgin of the Consolation.  History  The Benedictines were the first monastic order to settle in this location. A church at the site, probably dedicated to Our Lady, stood adjacent to the ancient Roman walls of the city. It is held that in the 5th century, Bishop Maximus erected a church dedicated to St. Andrew Apostle with a small chapel to the Virgin with an icon. The icon, however, became the object of great veneration. Legend maintains that a blind pilgrim in the 12th century had his vision restored by the icon of the Virgin in the church. Inside the church, ex votos document centuries of miracles attributed to the Virgin.Storia del Santuario della Consolata, by Giacinto Marietti, Turin (1845). In 929 the Marquis Adalbert ordered the construction of a monastery and endowed it with some territories. The Romanesque bell tower dates to about this time, and was built next to the foundation of one of the corner turrets of the old Roman fort which later became Turin. Architecture The church was originally built in the style of a basilica. Over the years the church and the icon were rebuilt and restored by various orders of monks. In 1448 the prior of Sant'Andrea expanded the church building one bay to the west. With the increased popularity of devotion to Our Lady of Consolation, the church changed from a parish to a shrine. The first major reconstruction leading to the present church was commissioned in 1678 by Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Savoy- Nemours.Fr√©zet, Jean (1827). Histoire de la Maison de Savoie 2. Alliana et Paravia Architect Guarino Guarini and engineer Antonio Bertola created the elliptical shape of the church nave, and added a new hexagonal chapel on the north side to accommodate the venerated icon of Mary. East-west axis of main altar The architect Filippo Juvarra in 1729-1740 added the North presbytery, thus creating a church with two apparent axis: a main altar on the east, while retaining the famed icon as a chapel to the north. This period also saw the decoration of the dome by Giovanni Battista Crosato.\\"Shrine of Our Lady of Consolation\\", Citta e Cattedrali 1852 engraving of La Consolata The neoclassical facade, portico, and burial crypt on the south‚Äìnorth axis date from 1845-1860 with contributions by Pietro Anselmetti; further additions were made in 1899-1904 under the guidance of Carlo Ceppi. The interior has a jubilantly polychrome rococo decoration with colored marbles and solomonic columns. The Juvarra altar has two marble angels in adoration by Carlo Antonio Tantardini. The interior has a sculpture of two praying queens by Vincenzo Vela. Outside the church is a statue of a virgin and child on a column. The church serves as a burial place for a number of saints affiliated with Turin: Giuseppe Cafasso and Leonardo Murialdo, as well as the Blessed Giuseppe Allamano, rector (1880-1926) and founder of the Mission Institute of the Consolata. Every June 20, a procession of the icon of the Virgin takes place in the streets of the city.Santuario de la Consolata Official website of the sanctuary The church is an eclectic collection of architecture, and includes portions of an ancient Roman wall, a Romanesque bell-tower, a baroque set of domes, almost Byzantine, sheltering a gothic icon, with two porticos, one of which has Neoclassic severity. The clashing of Guarini's and Juvarra's often mathematical architecture with the highly decorated interior, stubbornly magnetic to a ritualistic popular piousness, leads to a modern synthesis with immanent overtones. The shrine was bombed by the RAF on Aug. 13, 1943.\\"Santuario della Consolata\\", Museo Torino  References  Consolata Category:Baroque architecture in Turin Category:Roman Catholic churches in Turin Category:Guarino Guarini buildings ","title":"Santuario della Consolata"},{"id":"42147519","text":"Anjali Parvati Koda is a writer-director in Telugu films, acclaimed playwright and the co-founder of Hyderabad's popular theatre group Samahaara along with theatre personality Rathna Shekar Reddy.

He later became a politician in liberated Ni≈°. He was a merchant by profession, who on his trip to Russia met with Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá and decided to stay in Ni≈° to prepare a future liberation with the help of the Serbian Army. Ra≈°iƒá was one of the founders and organizers of the Ni≈° Committee, established in 1874, with the goal of liberating the Ni≈° Sanjak. His unit joined general Mikhail Chernyayev in 1876. Life =Early= Ra≈°iƒá was born in Ni≈ü (Ni≈°), part of the Sanjak of Ni≈°, Ottoman Empire (modern Serbia), in ca. 1839.Stojanoviƒá-Boke 1941 He is said to have been lively by nature and combative. A merchant by profession, he had good connections in the Principality of Serbia and Ni≈° Eyalet. In 1858 he entered Serbia, with the intent to go to Russia, however, the dynastical change made him change his mind.Miliƒá 1983 p. 293 While at Negotin, he heard that Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá would arrive, so he waited for him, and then the two spoke. Ra≈°iƒá, as a respectable Ni≈° citizen, was now sent secretly by the Obrenoviƒá government to instigate revolt in the Ni≈° area and beyond against the Ottomans. The planned operation was not implemented in 1860.Stojkoviƒá-Stojiƒçiƒá-Rakiƒá 1992 p. 112 It proved a long process, and Kole Ra≈°iƒá sought, from then on, the liberation of Ni≈° and then the other regions under Ottoman rule. =Revolutionary organization= Ni≈° Committee swearing Oath. Kole Ra≈°iƒá is seen kneeling before the priest. On February 24, 1874, the \\"Serbian Liberation Committee for the Sanjak of Ni≈°\\", known simply as the Ni≈° Committee, was founded and organized by Kole Ra≈°iƒá, Todor Milovanoviƒá, Dimitrije ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Milan Noviƒçiƒá, Tasko Tasa Uzunoviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Pop Maniƒá, Mihajlo Bo≈æidarac, and Todor Stankoviƒá. They gathered at Bo≈æidarac's house, and Orthodox priest Petar Ikonomoviƒá swore Oath on the Christian cross and Gospel, reminiscent of the Ora≈°ac Assembly (1804). The Ni≈° Committee's plan was a systematic action, through local uprisings weaken the Ottomans, and with gradual arming of the people help liberate the region. Ra≈°iƒá was declared vojvoda. In the Ottomans' eyes, Ra≈°iƒá posed no threat, as he seemed to like drinking and women. However, when the Ottomans thought he was active in the han, he was around in the villages and spoke to the people about the definite liberation that they had waited for centuries. Vojvoda Kole had been sent throughout Dobriƒç (Donji Milanovac), Toplica and Zaplanje (where Stanko ƒåavdar and Srndak had revolted, before him). In 1875, the Herzegovina Uprising broke out, giving hope to the people of the Sanjak of Ni≈°. The Ottomans saw through Ra≈°iƒá's real activity, and on June 25, 1875, Kole Ra≈°iƒá and other notable exposed Ni≈° people crossed the border and escaped death, while further action was continued in Ni≈° by other conspirators far less prominent. By 1876 his unit (cheta) consisted of 300 fighters, and he joined general Mikhail Chernyayev in the battles for the liberation of Ni≈° and the other regions. He had summoned the unit with the help of Milo≈° Milojeviƒá and the neighbouring villages which were still under Ottoman rule. His unit was active between Ni≈° and Leskovac during the Serbo-Turkish War (1876‚Äì78). =Serbo-Turkish War (1876‚Äì78)= Photograph dated 1876. The unit's task was to clear the way for the Serbian Army's further penetration into the south. In the First Serbo-Turkish War, Kole Ra≈°iƒá, alongside Todor Stankoviƒá, and other notable leaders of the Ni≈° Committee, as well as other people like Milo≈° Milojeviƒá and Vladimir-Vlajko Stojanoviƒá and others, helped the Serbian Army. On December 9, 1877, a combined unit of Serbian soldiers and volunteers liberated the villages of Koƒçane, Pukovac and the bridge on Morava near ƒåeƒçina, which had great strategical importance, as thus Ni≈° was cut towards the south. Leskovac entered relations with Kole, after which it was decided that his unit enter the town.Stojkoviƒá-Stojiƒçiƒá-Rakiƒá 1992 pp. 117-120 His unit and the army vanguard were the first to enter Leskovac, on December 11, 1877, where he held a speech to the liberated people. By order of the High Command he continued to organize an uprising in the direction Vlasotince- Rudare-Turekovac. Kole, who had headed off with his volunteers from liberated Leskovac, were greeted by the Vlasotince rebels who had disarmed 170 Ottomans. After the liberation of these towns, Kole continued his work in helping the guerilla warfare in Old Serbia. On December 31, 1877, the town officials of Leskovac sent a delegation which included Kole Ra≈°iƒá, five from Leskovac and one from Vlasotince, to greet Prince Milan I when he entered Ni≈° for the first time.Stojkoviƒá-Stojiƒçiƒá-Rakiƒá 1992 p. 126 During the fight for the liberation of Ni≈°, alongside the Royal Army, some 6,000 volunteers and rebels from the liberated Ottoman areas participated. The 6,000 men were led by Kole Ra≈°iƒá. After the war, for his work, he was titled vojvoda. After the war, the Serbian military government sent armament and aid to rebels in Kosovo and Macedonia. Christian rebel bands were formed all over the region. Many of those bands, privately organized and aided by the government, were established in Serbia and crossed into Ottoman territory. In that way, Micko Krstiƒá formed a rebel band in 1879 in Ni≈°, with the help of Ra≈°iƒá and the military government in Vranje. =Political work= After the war, he enter the political life of liberated Ni≈°. As the representative of the Liberal Party, he won the first elections for the National Assembly of the town of Ni≈° and became the state representative of Ni≈°.

Harriet Staunton (n√©e Richardson) died in a Penge lodging house on 13 April, five days after her one-year-old child, Thomas Staunton, died of malnutrition at Guy's Hospital. In September of the same year, Harriet's husband Louis Staunton was convicted of wilful murder at the Old Bailey together with his partner Alice Rhodes, his brother Patrick Staunton and Patrick's wife Elizabeth. All four were sentenced to death by hanging but the sentences were later commuted to terms of imprisonment after doubts were raised concerning the medical evidence and the impartiality of the presiding judge. Background Harriet Richardson's father was a clergyman from Essex who died when his daughter was twelve. She later received ¬£5,000 from the will of a great-aunt. She was reportedly of limited mental capacity and appears to have had learning disabilities. Louis (or Lewis) Staunton (born c. 1851) was an auctioneer's clerk from Streatham. At the time of his first encounter with Harriet he was twenty-three years old and involved in a relationship with a fifteen-year-old girl named Alice Rhodes. Staunton's younger brother, Patrick, was married to Alice Rhodes' older sister Elizabeth. Louis Staunton met Harriet through Alice Rhodes' stepfather Thomas Hinksman, a relative of the Richardson family. After a brief courtship, the couple were engaged to be married. Harriet's mother Mrs Butterfield (she had remarried) was strongly opposed to the marriage and made an unsuccessful attempt to have her daughter declared a lunatic and placed under the protection of the Court of Chancery. The couple were married at Clapham in June 1875. Mrs Butterfield visited her newly married daughter at her home in Brixton, but then received a letter apparently written by her daughter saying that she was not to visit the couple in future. Crime In March 1876 Harriet gave birth to a son who was named Thomas. At about the same time Louis bought a house called Little Grays near Cudham in Kent. In August, Louis moved into Little Grays where he lived with Alice Rhodes while Harriet and Thomas were sent to live at Frith Cottage, one mile away, with Patrick and Elizabeth. Mother and child were confined to a small upstairs room with no curtains, washing facilities or proper furniture. She was dissuaded from leaving the room by threats of violence from Patrick Staunton. Mrs Butterfield made efforts to contact her daughter, but when she travelled to Little Grays she was turned away by Louis. In October, Harriet attempted to escape from the cottage but was forcibly restrained and assaulted by Patrick. The infant Thomas Staunton became gravely ill in early 1877 and was taken by Patrick and Elizabeth Staunton to Guy's Hospital in London on 8 April. The child died later that day: he was severely malnourished, and had a bruise on his cheek suggesting physical abuse. On 12 April, Harriet was removed from the cottage and sent to a lodging house at 34 Forbes Road, Penge. On her arrival, she was described as looking \\"more like a corpse than a living woman\\" and she died the following day. The death certificate gave her cause of death as \\"cerebral disease\\" or \\"apoplexy\\". Investigation The accused at the trial l-to-r Louis Staunton, Patrick Staunton, Elizabeth Staunton, Alice Rhodes Suspicions about Harriet's death were originally raised by her brother- in-law Louis Casabianca, who encountered Louis Staunton in a post office where the latter was attempting to get information about recording his wife's death. Casabianca went to the police and an inquest was held. Harriet's body was found to be filthy and severely malnourished: her hair was matted and infested with lice. The cause of death was now recorded as \\"starvation and neglect\\". At the time of her death she weighed . Louis Staunton, Patrick Staunton, Elizabeth Staunton and Alice Rhodes were arrested and charged with murder. The case attracted great public attention: models of the four accused were soon on display at Madame Tussauds. Trial and review In September, the Stauntons and Alice Rhodes were tried for the murder of Harriet Staunton at the Old Bailey with judge Henry Hawkins presiding. The case attracted great interest, with \\"fashionable\\" ladies scrutinising the accused through opera glasses and refreshing themselves with champagne. The defence, led by Edward George Clarke claimed that Harriet's malnourishment was due to alcoholism which led to her refusing to eat. Medical testimony was also presented which stated that the victim had died from meningitis and tuberculosis. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all four defendants, who were sentenced to death by hanging. As the verdict was read, Patrick Staunton \\"twitched convulsively\\" while Louis Staunton \\"stared fixedly\\" and appeared \\"completely dazed\\". Despite the cold and foggy weather, a large crowd had gathered around the court building and cheered the verdict. In passing sentence, Hawkins said that the crime was one of the most \\"black and hideous\\" on record and commented on the incredible \\"barbarity\\" and cruelty involved. Following the verdict a letter was published in The Lancet, signed by seven hundred physicians protesting about the way that expert medical evidence had been ignored. It was also widely thought that Hawkins had exhibited bias against the accused. A campaign against the verdict was led by the novelist Charles Reade and the case was reviewed by the Home Secretary R. A. Cross. Alice Rhodes was pardoned and released immediately, while the sentences of the other three were commuted to life imprisonment. Patrick Staunton died in prison, but Elizabeth was released in 1883. Louis Staunton was released in 1897, still protesting his innocence, and emigrated to Australia. Popular culture In 1934 Elizabeth Jenkins published the novel Harriet based on the case. The novel won the Femina - Vie Heureuse Prize, beating Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust, and was republished in 2012 by Persephone Books. The case was re-examined in the BBC programme Murder, Mystery and My Family (series 4, episode 6).

Biography Glasser was raised in a Jewish family in Poughkeepsie, New York, one of four sisters including the children's writer Jacqueline Preiss Weitzman. She has had two successful careers, the first as a ballet dancer and the second as an illustrator. She began her career as a soloist with the Pennsylvania Ballet, until injury forced her to leave. She returned to school at age 30 and earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Parsons The New School for Design. After graduation, it took five years for her big break, when she was asked to illustrate Alexander, Who's Not (Do You Hear Me? I Mean It!) Going to Move by Judith Viorst, published by Atheneum Books in 1995. It was a sequel to the extraordinarily successful Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (Atheneum, 1972) and Glasser worked \\"in the style of Ray Cruz,\\" the original illustrator. She and her sister, Jacqueline Weitzman, collaborated on You Can't Take a Balloon Into the Metropolitan Museum, which featured an adventure through the streets of New York City and was named an ALA Notable Book for 1998. (You Can't Take a Balloon is Glasser's second-published title in the Library of Congress catalog.) Since then she has illustrated picture books with writers including radio star Garrison Keillor, poet Elizabeth Garton Scanlon, and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York. She also collaborated on three books with Lynne Cheney, the wife of the then Vice President, whom she first met in 2001. Her illustrations for America, A Patriotic Primer were described as \\"the greatest strength of this ambitious project, with endearing children of all colors, kinds, and cultures, and dozens of historical figures and sites rendered in carefully researched detail.\\" In 2005 Glasser was paired with the writer Jane O‚ÄôConnor to illustrate the Fancy Nancy books, where her \\"action-filled pen- and-ink drawings put Nancy in wild tutus, ruby slippers, fairy wings and fuzzy slippers\\". Books in the series, which now number upwards of 80 titles, have spent over 330 weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers list, and have sold more than 43 million volumes. The Children's Book Council named her 2013 Illustrator of the Year for Fancy Nancy and the Mermaid Ballet after more than one million young people cast their votes in the 6th annual Children's Choice Book Awards. Disney Junior turned Glasser's most popular character into an animated television heroine, with the Disney Fancy Nancy (TV series) debuting on July 13, 2018, and the animation company greenlighting a second season even before the show premiered. Disney Junior ordered a third season of the Emmy Award-nominated series ahead of its October 4, 2019, Season Two premiere. Glasser's latest collaboration is with the international best-selling author Ann Patchett. They met while Glasser was on a book tour for Fancy Nancy at Patchett's Nashville book store Parnassus Books. Lambslide, Patchett's first book for children, was published on May 7, 2019. The second book by the duo, Escape Goat, will come out in Fall 2020. In 2015 Glasser was named one of 100 Most Influential people in Orange County, California,.

The mosque was commissioned by Osman Shah, also known as Kara Osman Pasha, who was the son of one of Sultan Selim I's daughters and the executed vizier ƒ∞skender Pasha (died 1515). Osman Shah for a long time dwelt in Trikala as the governor of the local province, the Sanjak of Trikala. The mosque was designed by the Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan and is the only one that he designed in modern Greece. The exact dating of the mosque is uncertain, but it was probably built in the period 1550‚Äì60, most likely in the late 1550s. Osman attached several charitable establishments to the mosque, among others a madrasah, an alms house, and a caravanserai, and was himself buried in a t√ºrbe in the mosque's southern courtyard at the time of his death in 1567/8. By the time of Evliya √áelebi's visit a century later, the mosque was the principal mosque of the city. It is also the only mosque still standing in the city of Trikala out of the at least eight that Evliya √áelebi reported seeing. The building itself consists of a square prayer hall topped by a large diameter semi-spherical dome. The portico (revak) in front, was completely rebuilt in the renovations carried out in 1998. The ashlar minaret is located on the northwestern corner and is well preserved, except for its missing roof. All other buildings attached to the mosque have since vanished, except for the founder's octagonal t√ºrbe (tomb), which is used as a storage site for artefacts recovered from archaeological excavations. The mosque is no longer used for worship; it now functions as a venue for minor events and is a protected UNESCO site.

The youngest member to be elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (as of 2013), she was a 2011 L'Or√©al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science laureate \\"for her work on light-emitting materials and innovative ways of capturing solar energy.\\" Early years and education Vivian Wing-Wah Yam was born in British Hong Kong. Her father was a civil engineer, although Yam says that neither he nor her mother steered her towards her career. Yam cites being intrigued by the sight of mercury and a workaholic and pregnant biology teacher who taught her up to the very last minute. Yam attended an Anglican grammar school. She received her B.Sc in Chemistry (1985) and PhD (1988) degrees at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) where she was on the badminton team, studying under Chi-Ming Che. Career In 1988, she became a junior faculty member at the Department of Applied Science, City Polytechnic of Hong Kong; at the time, there were no facilities at all for teaching chemistry. She helped with establishing the first chemistry books in the library as well as ordering the first beakers and chemicals. Yam's work took her to Caltech in the late 1980s. After a spell at the University of Rochester in 1990 she went to study at the Imperial College London in 1991 and stayed until 1992. She worked with the Nobel laureate Geoffrey Wilkinson. Her research turned to organometallic synthesis \\"studying the luminescence of complexes with metal‚Äìmetal interactions\\". She worked with tetraethyllead which at the time was not a banned additives for petrol. This work was on the border between organic and inorganic chemicals. Yam has been associated particularly with the elements osmium, platinum and ruthenium. She joined the HKU faculty in 2001 where she is the Philip Wong Wilson Wong Professor of Chemistry and Energy. Yam became a Fulbright Scholar in 2007. Yam was elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2001, becoming the youngest member. The previous holder of this record was, Che, Yam's earlier mentor. She was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World in 2006 and a member of the Foreign Associate of National Academy of Sciences in 2012. Application Yam's research deals with organic light emitting diodes which are brighter and more efficient that the older light emitting diodes; her chemistry has enabled much more efficient displays to be created for mobile phones and laptops. These OLEDs can be deposited on clear plastic, glass or more unusual materials to also create improved car headlamps and larger flat television screens.

The Yellow River is the main river of northern China, one of the world's major rivers and a river of great cultural importance in China. This is reflected in Chinese mythology by the tales surrounding the deity Hebo. The descriptive term Hebo is not the deity's only name, and its worship is geographically widespread. Some of the character ascribed to Hebo is related to the character of the Yellow River itself: a river that has been described as one of China's greatest assets as well as one of the greatest sources of sorrow. Some of the world's greatest floods accompanied by massive loss of human life have been due to the Yellow River overflowing its banks and even shifting course and establishing a new river bed. The Yellow River has also been one of the major agricultural sources for irrigation of farms that have provided for the dietary needs of the population at least from the cradle of Chinese civilization through the present day. To some extent, the deity Hebo is a personification of the character of the Yellow River. However, Hebo has also had an important role in the history of religious worship in China (especially North China) and also having a more general function in terms of Chinese culture, including literature and poetry. Names Hebo is also known as Bingyi (). Today, the meaning of bo () is generally considered to be that of an honorific title, of a martial or noble designation, similar to the European titles of nobility rendered in English as \\"count\\" or \\"earl\\". He () may be used somewhat generically to refer to rivers in general or to various particular flowing bodies of water, but in this case is particularly and primarily associated with the Yellow River of China. Character Hebo as depicted in the Classic of Mountains and Seas, 1597 edition Hebo is the god of the Yellow River, one of the world's major rivers with close association to Chinese culture. Reflecting the personification of the Yellow River, Hebo has been regarded as benevolent, but also greedy, unpredictable, and dangerously destructive. The Jin scholar Guo Pu commented that early illustrations depicted Hebo on his chariot‚Äîpulled by two dragons through the clouds‚Äîriding in all directions. In the \\"Nine Songs\\" from the Songs of Chu, the performer narrates a wedding journey with him in a chariot drawn by two dragons. Some early accounts‚Äîsuch as the book Shizi wherein he bestowed the River Diagram to Yu the Great‚Äîdescribes Hebo as having a white face of a human with the body of a fish. The poem \\"Questions of Heaven\\" alludes to a myth about Yi shooting Hebo. The Han commentator Wang Yi annotated it with the following story: The Huainanzi stated that Houyi had shot Hebo for the latter had drowned people. A chapter of the Zhuangzi mentions Hebo visiting the northern sea, where Ruo‚Äîthe God of the Sea‚Äîresides, beginning with the following: Historical worship Hebo as depicted by Xiao Yuncong in the Lisao (), imprint of 1645 The Yellow River is believed to have originated at the mythological Mount Kunlun, leading to a cult to Hebo within the ancient states of northwestern and central China before spreading southward. Hebo was worshiped at various times as an object of human sacrifice and as a figure in the imperial cult. Hebo has been said to have helped Yu the Great to end the Great Flood of China, by providing a map of the Yellow River. Animals as well as humans have been drowned in the river as sacrifices, including young women destined to become the god's wives. The oracle bone inscriptions provide solid evidence of the sacrificial worship of Hebo during the Shang dynasty. Human sacrifice seems to have continued into the Warring States period, prominently featuring the presentation of a virgin female human bride, floated on a bridal raft upon the surface of the river, as an offering to Hebo. This practice was apparently ended (at the Ye shamanic college) by scholar-official Ximen Bao., who refers to Ximen Bao as \\"Hsi-men Pao\\". However, other bridal sacrifices continued elsewhere, until the time of Shi Huangdi, of Qin state., who refers to the locale as \\"Lin-tsin\\". The book Zhuangzi stated that the wu-shamans and zhu-priests‚Äîwho were in charge of the rituals‚Äîconsidered oxen with white foreheads, pigs with turned-up snouts, and humans with piles as unsuitable for offerings. There were cases where people drowned horses and cast valuables into the river as sacrifices. During the Han dynasty, occasional sacrifices of jade objects, together with a live horse, are recorded. Culture Hebo is one of the main characters in the cast of Jiu Ge, the Nine Songs, a work anthologized in the ancient poetic source Chu Ci. The Jiu Ge lyrics, including the \\"He Bo\\" section seem to have originally been a lyrical part an ancient religious dramatic performance which also included costuming, choreography, musical accompaniment, and other features, which, unlike the lyrics themselves, failed to survive the vicissitudes of history. Of the deities specified therein, Hebo is the one who has had the most mainstream cultural appeal.

It was built about 1774, and is a 2 1/2-half story clapboard dwelling. It is supported by a high brick foundation that encloses a raised basement. It has a five bay wide verandah supported by six slender Doric order columns. Records show over 100 slaves were held in bondage on the plantation as of 1835. Lewisfield fronts on the Cooper River and was bounded by Exeter Plantation to the north and Mulberry Plantation to the south. Sedgewick Lewis bought the 1000 acre plantation in 1767 from Baronet John Colleton. At that time, the plantation was known as Little Landing, but it was later known as Lewisfield because of Lewis' ownership. Lord Cornwalis was a guest of Lewis when Conwalis was heading to Charleston from Camden. A Revolutionary War skirmish occurred directly in front of the house when Colonel Wade Hampton (1752‚Äì1835) surprised a British force that had stopped at Lewisfield Plantation to await a paroled prisoner of war, Keating Simons, who was the owner of the plantation at the time. In 1937, Robert R.M. Carpenter bought the estate for $50,000 from the Lewisfield Club, a collection of owners. Carpenter intended to use the house as a duck hunting property in the winters. In 1948, Carpenter sold the plantation (by then increased to 2500 acres) to the Williams Furniture Corporation of Sumter, South Carolina. The business bought the house not for the historic plantation house but rather to secure several million board feet of lumber growing on about 1500 acres of the estate; the business did not have immediate plans for the portion of the estate with the house and hunting grounds. South Carolinian politician Rembert Dennis lived on the plantation. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Turney uses a sit- ski in competitions and has represented Great Britain at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Paralympic Games. Personal history Turney was born in 1979 in Northampton. Turney was a promising snowboarder, until an accident on the slopes of Yamagata in Japan left her paralysed from the waist down. Skiing career While recovering in hospital from her spinal injuries, Turney decided to get back into sport after being inspired by the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino (Turin). The following year she took up monoskiing and in 2007 she was accepted into the British Disabled Ski Team (BDST). Within a year she made her debut for the British team when she made her GB debut at the NORAM races in Canada. The next year Turney was competing at the highest level and was selected for Great Britain the 2009 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships in South Korea, finishing fourth in the giant slalom. In 2010 Turney was part of the Great Britain team that travelled to Vancouver to participate in her first Winter Paralympics. Turney stated in a 2014 interview that she was sent to the Games mainly to build her experience, but managed a sixth place in the slalom when ranked 16th. The next year she was back in the Great Britain team, this time at Sestriere in Italy at the 2011 World Championships. Although failing to finish in the sitting slalom, Turney finished fourth in the giant slalom. In the 2013 World Championship in La Molina, Spain, Turney was entered into four events, but failed to finish any. In 2014, she was selected for ParalympicsGB for the Winter Paralympics in Sochi. She failed to finish in the opening downhill on 8 March, falling on a course which Turney described as \\"pretty tough\\". She subsequently finished fourth in the super-G, sixth in the slalom, and eighth in the grand slalom.

Biography =Early life= Iwannis was a monk either at the monastery of Eusebona, according to the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, or the monastery of Zuqnin, as per Bar Hebraeus' Ecclesiastical History. The Chronography of Elijah of Nisibis attests that Iwannis was later appointed as bishop of Harran, whereas the histories of Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus record that he was bishop of Hauran instead. In 739/740 (AG 1051), after the death of the Patriarch Athanasius III, the bishops met to elect a successor, but as no agreement could be reached, it was agreed that Athanasius Sandalaya, bishop of Maypherqa·π≠, was to be entrusted with the organisation of an election by lot. The Ecclesiastical History of Daniel, son of Moses of Tur Abdin, as preserved in Michael the Syrian's history, alleged that Athanasius orchestrated Iwannis' election as he wrote his name on all three ballots, however this can be disregarded as an attempt to discredit Athanasius. =Patriarch of Antioch= The History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria records that Iwannis was selected as Athanasius III's successor as patriarch by the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al- Malik. Iwannis met with the Caliph Marwan II at Harran, and presented him with fifty camels laden with gifts, for which he was awarded a decree that authorised him to perform his patriarchal duties. In doing so, he drew the ire of a number of bishops who resented his appeal to secular authority. The patriarch's troubles began in 746/747 on the issue of the succession of the highly coveted diocese of Tur Abdin after the death of its incumbent bishop Athanasius of Nunib. At the request of Cyriacus, bishop of Sijistan, the Caliph Marwan instructed Iwannis not to ordain a bishop of Tur Abdin, thus bringing him into conflict with Athanasius Sandalaya, who as archbishop of Mesopotamia had designated his prot√©g√© Dionysius as Athanasius of Nunib's successor. Opposition to Iwannis grew as the monks of the monastery of Saint Matthew supported Athanasius' right as archbishop to designate candidates to empty suffragan sees, and accused Iwannis of ordaining bishops for eastern dioceses (within the former Sasanian Empire) without the approval of Paul, archbishop of Tikrit, and thus against church canons. In response, Iwannis convened a synod at Muraiba near Resh øayna that was attended by Athanasius Sandalaya, David, bishop of Dara, Timothy, bishop of Edessa, and thirty other bishops. At the synod, it was decided that Bacchus, bishop of Nineveh, who was in fact responsible for the ordinations without Paul's approval, the bishops he had unlawfully ordained, and the monks of the monastery of Saint Matthew were excommunicated, and Cyriacus was condemned for his attempt to seize the see of Tur Abdin. Cyriacus subsequently took refuge with Athanasius. In c. 748/749, Iwannis alienated Athanasius Sandalaya further with his transfer of Abay, bishop of Arzen, to the diocese of Amida, instead of Athanasius' prot√©g√© Isaiah, bishop of Ashpharin. Due to the decrepitude of Severus, the previous bishop of Amida, Athanasius had made Isaiah responsible for the administration of five districts in the diocese of Amida and expected to have him succeed Severus, but was resentful to learn that Abay was instead appointed to the see as he had bribed the Caliph Marwan's son to instruct Iwannis to do so. The dispute between Iwannis and Athanasius Sandalaya thus came to a head, and the latter resorted to an appeal to the Caliph Marwan by accusing the patriarch of having extorted 150,000 dinars from the archdiocese of Tikrit and the eastern dioceses, and of simony. Iwannis in turn accused Athanasius of keeping a wife disguised as a nun, and of having several mistresses. Iwannis convened a synod at Harran in 750 to settle the dispute, but Athanasius refused to attend even after he was summoned several times, and thus he and his supporters, namely the bishops Cyriacus of Sijistan, Bacchus of Nineveh, Athanasius of Resh øayna, Isaiah of Ashpharin, and John, were excommunicated. The Caliph Marwan detained Iwannis at his monastery at Harran, and forbade him from leaving until he had paid 12,000 dinars and made peace with Athanasius. Amidst the Abbasid Revolution, the Caliph Marwan marched east to Iraq to confront the proclamation of the rival Abbasid Caliph As-Saffah, and was accompanied by Athanasius Sandalaya, but was defeated at the Battle of the Zab in February 750. The battle marked the end of Marwan's rule as he found no support in Syria, and fled to Egypt, where he was killed in August 750. Meanwhile, Athanasius Sandalaya returned from Marwan's campaign after having been robbed, whilst Iwannis bided his time at his monastery. =Later life= Peace was seemingly achieved after Iwannis and Athanasius had been reconciled at a synod at Tarmana near Cyrrhus in 752, but the latter reasserted himself soon after by bribing Abdallah, the Caliph As-Saffah's brother, to provide him with a systaticon (letter of investiture) for the title of archbishop of Mesopotamia, without Iwannis' approval. The Caliph As-Saffah instructed bishops to attend a synod at Tella in the same year, excluding Iwannis, at which they were pressured into accepting Athanasius' title as archbishop of Mesopotamia, and to agree to lift the excommunication that Iwannis had imposed upon Athanasius' supporters at the synods of Harran and of Muraiba. The acknowledgement of Athanasius as archbishop of Mesopotamia is interpreted as a recognition of the extension of his authority from the area coterminous with the former Roman province of Mesopotamia to the area known as the Jazira in Arabic.

The operation was headed by K. Vijay Kumar, and N. K. Senthamarai Kannan Yadava. Veerappan was shot dead in the operation on 18 October 2004 along with three of his associates, Sethukuli Govinda, Chandre Gowda and Sethumani, while four policemen were injured. Veerappan defied the state governments of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala and Indian Border security paramilitary forces, and maintained a small army, which at one point numbered hundreds. He was wanted for killing approximately 184 people, about half of whom were police officers, including senior police and forest officials. He was also wanted for poaching about 200 elephants and smuggling ivory worth US$2,600,000(‚Çπ16 Crore) and about 10,000 tonnes of sandalwood worth approximately US$22,000,000(‚Çπ143 Crore ). The joint Special Task Force (STF) operation of Veerappan, constituted in 1991 by the state governments of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, is considered one of the most expensive in Indian history, consuming 1 billion over the years. Background Veerappan (Koose Muniswamy Veerappan Gounder, 18 January 1952 ‚Äì 18 October 2004), also called \\"Sandalwood Veerappan\\", was an Indian bandit (also called a dacoit in India) who was active for years in scrub and forest lands covering about 6,000 km¬≤ in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. For over a decade, Veerappan defied the state governments of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala and Indian Border security paramilitary forces, and maintained a small army, which at one point numbered hundreds. He was wanted for killing approximately 184 people, about half of whom were police officers, including senior police and forest officials. During his video interview with Nakkeeran editor R. Gopal, he confessed to the 120 murders he committed. While his initial days of dacoity were restricted to satisfying his financial needs, his later actions included demand of release of militants from jail in exchange of the hostages. Veerappan first came in news when he murdered Chidambaram, a forest officer who was against his illegal trade. In 1991, he shot P Srinivas, a Karnataka Deputy Conservator of Forests and beheaded in a Kali temple. During the subsequent years, he killed tens of police officers and tribal people, whom he felt, were against his illegal trade. In 1997, he kidnapped Karnataka forest officers and after lot of negotiations with Nakkeeran editor Gopal, he released them. In the same year, he kidnapped 21 tourists, but later released them without any harm. He came to national limelight when he kidnapped the Kannada actor Rajkumar during 2000.Krupakar 2011 , p. 7K.G. 2004, p. 322 His last big crime was in 2000, when he abducted Nagapppa, a retired minister of Karnataka. Nagappa was found dead in the forest later, but Veerappan denied his killing. He was also wanted for poaching about 200 elephants and smuggling ivory worth US$2,600,000 and about 10,000 tonnes of sandalwood worth approximately US$22,000,000. A reward of was offered for Veerappan's capture, yet he evaded arrest for 20 years until he was killed by police in 2004. The operation The joint Special Task Force (STF) operation of Veerappan, constituted in 1991 by the state governments of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, is considered one of the costliest in Indian history, consuming 1 billion over the years. The operation involved infiltration by the police men into enemy camp with the help of tribal people. Since Veerappan was aware of the terrain of the forest, it was planned to bring him out of the forest. As per the report of police, the report was planned for ten months, the execution took 3 weeks and the final operation lasted only 45 minutes. STF personnel infiltrated as hawkers, masons and local service staff in the villages where Veerappan was supposedly roaming. Down the years, due to ageing and others getting killed, his troop was reduced to four men. Veerapan was planning to take a medical treatment for his eye in South Arcot and was planning to flee out of the forest. On the day of the operation, Veerapan was escorted out of the forest to the ambulance stationed at Papirappati village in Dharmapuri district, which was a police vehicle, by one of the police who earlier infiltrated his gang. A 35 member troop was stationed in the village, a few security men were hiding in security tankers in the road and others were hiding in the bushes. The driver of the ambulance, who was also a policeman, made an escape. As per police report, Veerappan and his gang were first warned and then asked to surrender, which was denied and the gang started firing at the STF personnel. The STF retaliated by firing grenades and gun fire. Veerappan was killed on the spot, while his gangmen died on the ambulance taking them to the government hospital. After the operation, the STF recovered 12 bore Remington pump action gun, two AK-47, a self-loading rifle, two hand grenades and cash worth 3.5 lakhs. The file photograph released by the police indicated three bullet shots on him, forehead, hip and ribs. His body was kept in the Dharampuri hospital where scores of people came in to view his body, though they were not allowed to. Police found it difficult to control the crowd outside the hospital. There was a brief controversy about the burial as the wife of Veerappan, Muthulakshmi, was against cremation and wanted it to be placed in the house of Veerappan's brother. They also claimed that the right to perform the final rites rested with the family. Controversies The operation of killing Veerappan raised various controversies. It was alleged that the person who got killed in the encounter was not Veerappan as he used to have a bigger mustache. Police established his identity with fingerprints and also with confirmation with his relatives. The nature of the gunshots were alleged to be mismatching with the version narrated by the police involved in the encounter. But it was proven from the post mortem reports and ballistic experts that it matched the version of the narration. Some section of the media claimed that Veerappan could have been captured alive and that he was murdered only for political reasons. They also claimed that capturing him alive and subjecting him to trial could have brought out several unknown truth. But it was clarified by the police that fire had to be opened for retaliation. There were also outcry from human rights activists that Veerappan was not given a fair chance to justify himself. Aftermath Jungle Lodges and Resorts Limited, a Karnataka government undertaking, launched 11 new jungle camps during 2010, with one of them covering Gopinatham, where Veerappan lived. The tourism involved trek through the vast BR and MM hills and a narration of the places where Veerapan lived and held people in hostage by a trained local guide. K. Vijay Kumar was awarded the President's gallantry medal in 2005 for the operation. In 2016, K. Vijay Kumar announced that he was writing a book penning down his first hand account of the operation. After the operation, Kumar became the Chief of the CRPF and currently serves as Senior Security Advisor to the Home Ministry of India. Kumar said that he would not reveal any names in the book, but rather would focus on incidents that had led to the killing of Veerappan. Popular culture The operation was an inspiration for several fictional works. A 125 episode tele serial named Santhanakadu on the life of the brigand was telecast in Makkal TV in 2007 and it drew lot of controversy. Veerappan's widow, Muthulakshmi, filed a case in a sessions court against the telecast as it would demean her family, but lost the case. In 2012, A. M. R. Ramesh directed the Kannada-Tamil bilingual Attahasa and Vana Yuddham starring Arjun Sarja. In 2016, Ram Gopal Varma directed the Kannada super-hit, Killing Veerappan, and a Bollywood sub-version Veerappan highlighting the role of K Vijay Kumar, and N. K. Senthamarai Kannan Yadava in the operation.

He was a man of strong and determined character, and had sufficient political skills to help bring about the downfall and death of the Earl of Stafford, who in the 1630s had been virtually all-powerful in Ireland.Wedgwood p.157 Family Background Crosby was of Gaelic Irish descent; his father Padraig Mac an Chros√°in (died 22 March 1611), had been active in English service since 1588 and helped transplant the septs of Laois into County Kerry. While remaining a Roman Catholic, he anglicised his name to Patrick Crosby. His younger brother was John Crosbie, Bishop of Ardfert and Aghadoe, ancestor of the Crosbie baronets. Patrick married Catherine, and in his will mentions his niece \\"Joan Moore\\" indicating that his wife may have been an O'More.Notes on the Family of Patrick Crosbie of Maryborough, by Whom the Seven Septs of Leix Were Transplanted to Tarbert in the County Kerry in 1608-9, Walter FitzGerald, The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland Sixth Series, Vol. 13, No. 2 (Dec. 31, 1923), pp. 133-150, https://www.jstor.org/stable/25513295?loggedin=true&seq;=1#page_scan_tab_contents Biography Sir Piers commanded an Irish regiment in the Duke of Buckingham's unsuccessful expedition to support La Rochelle in 1627. During the retreat Crosby commanded the rearguard. Buckingham, who was the Royal Favourite of Charles I, developed a high opinion of Crosby and supported his career, until his assassination in 1628. Due to Buckingham's influence Crosby was appointed to both the English and Irish Privy Councils.Herrup p.23 Crosby became a noted courtier, associated in particular with Queen Henrietta Maria and her favourite Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland.Wedgwood p.247 Crosby married firstly Sarah Barnewall, daughter of Sir Patrick Barnewall of Turvey and his second wife Mary Bagenal, who died before March 1618, leaving an only daughter, Elizabeth, who died young. He married secondly Elizabeth Noel, daughter of Sir Andrew Noel and widow of George Tuchet, 1st Earl of Castlehaven, and was therefore the stepfather of Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven. Through her, Crosby was able to obtain lands in County Armagh and County Tyrone after contending that the 2nd Earl had not fulfilled his obligations under the Plantation of Ulster. Crosby raised the issue in 1628, and in 1630 the King ruled in his favour.Herrup p.24 Crosby was one of several figures who stood to gain if Castlehaven died a felon when the Earl was charged, tried, convicted and executed in 1631, following allegations of rape and sodomy made by his wife and son.Herrup p.24 Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford Crosby became a leading opponent of the dominant figure in Irish politics in the 1630s, the Lord Deputy Thomas Wentworth. Wentworth in return despised Crosby, whom he referred to with contempt as \\"the tawny ribbon\\", perhaps a reference to his fondness for fine clothes. Wentworth also accused Crosby of leading a debauched private life.Wedgwood p.247 In 1634 he was returned as Member of Parliament for Queen's County. He voted in Parliament against a Bill to strengthen the laws against being an accessory to murder, to which Wentworth attached great importance.Kearney p.233 Crosby attacked Wentworth for failing to honour previously-pledged concessions to Catholics (\\"the Graces\\"). He remained a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, but in 1634 Wentworth, in an unprecedented move, persuaded the Council to forbid his attendance there, in retaliation for his voting against the legislation on murder.Wedgwood p.157 In 1639 he was prosecuted in Star Chamber for libelllng Wentworth, by claiming that he had killed one Captain Esmonde by ill-treatment, a charge which was almost certainly untrue; he was also accused of perjuring himself during the trial.Kearney p.185 At the same time Crosby's patron Lord Holland, another of Wentworth's ever-growing list of enemies, was spreading rumours that Wentworth was insane, giving Crosby as his source.Wedgwood pp.246‚Äì7 Along with Wentworth's other Irish enemies, Crosby supplied evidence for the prosecution when Wentworth was tried by the English Parliament for misgovernment in 1641, leading to his attainder and execution.Gentles p.46 Strafford in his eloquent defence referred to the old charge of perjury against Crosby. He marvelled (ironically) at Crosby's amazing ability to remember verbatim a conversation with Strafford which had supposedly taken place seven years earlier, when \\"in truth I never had such a discourse with him in my life\\".Wedgwood p.344 Crosby was a political ally of the powerful Earl of Cork, another implacable enemy of Wentworth. During this period, Crosby either raised or offered to raise Irish troops for military service overseas for both the Crown and other nations on a number of occasions. Along with other Irish nobleman, he offered his services to the King during the Scottish Crisis when it was planned for an Irish Army to make a landing on the Scottish coast.Ohlmeyer p.281 Last years Following the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion in 1641, Crosby was initially neutral. He later joined the Irish Confederates and also spent some time abroad. In 1643 he returned from France to Ireland. He was identified with the moderate faction which supported a quick settlement with Charles I, so that the Irish Confederates could send an expedition against their mutual enemy the English Parliamentarians. He died in 1646 after being imprisoned by a rival faction in the leadership of the Irish Confederacy.O Siochru p.254 He had no surviving children by either marriage, and his estates passed to his cousin, Sir Walter Crosbie, first of the Crosbie baronets, a son of Bishop Crosbie. His second wife Elizabeth was still living in 1644: her precise date of death is not recorded. References Bibliography * Gentles, I.J.

The Klos C was built in 1996, in Saint Petersburg, Russia by the shipbuilders Severnaya Verf. At the time of its christening, it was briefly known by the name Otztal, after which its name was changed to Klostertal and then Klos C in July, 2012. Operation Full Disclosure IDF photo of one of the captured long-range rockets found on the Klos C On March 5, 2014, the Israeli Navy boarded the vessel in the Red Sea during Operation Full Disclosure, suspecting that it was carrying weapons destined for militant groups in the Gaza Strip from the Islamic Republic of Iran. A large quantity of long-range missiles, identified by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as M-302s, were found concealed under bags of Portland cement on the ship, which was then directed to berth in Israel. With the Klos C secured by the IDF, and with the cooperation of its captain, the Panamanian flag it had been sailing under was lowered, and the flag of Israel as well as the Israeli Navy ensign were raised. The freighter was then escorted to Israel in a convoy. After docking in the port city of Eilat, the Israelis unloaded the Klos C's cargo and discovered an additional 181 mortars, and 400,000 rounds of ammunition meant to be used in assault rifles. Israel seized the cargo, and placed it on public display. Following the search of the ship and confiscation of weapons found on board, Israel released the vessel and its crew, and the Klos C returned to service. A UN expert panel later concluded that, while the shipment came from Iran, it was headed for Sudan rather than the Gaza Strip. The United States also had plans to intercept the vessel.

Life  The first recorded event in John Lazaropoulos' life is a banquet at the Monastery of Saint Eugenios he attended, in celebration of the Transfiguration of Christ (6 August); amongst the guests was the protovestiarios Constantine Loukites, whom Lazaropoulos describes as \\"a great man in word and deed.\\"Lazaropoulos, Synopsis, ll. 1626-1629; translated in Rosenqvist, Hagiographic Dossier, p. 337 He dates this banquet to the end of \\"my third age\\", and alludes to the fact both his parents were alive, which leads Jan Olof Rosenqvist to conclude Lazaropoulos was about 21 years old.Rosenqvist, Hagiographic Dossier, pp. 457, commentary on line 1610. He was later made a sacristan (skeuophylax), married, and had two sons by 1340. Not long after the Emperor of Trebizond, Basil, died that same year, Lazaropoulos left Trebizond when Basil's wife Irene and her two sons were sent into exile at Constantinople.Lazaropoulos, Synopsis, ll. 1664-1672; translated in Rosenqvist, Hagiographic Dossier, p. 339 Lazaropoulos was accompanied by his son Constantine to Constantinople, where he arranged for his education.

The Byzantine emperor asked John Lazaropoulos to escort the boy and his entourage to Trebizond.Lazaropoulos, Synopsis, ll. 1690f; translated in Rosenqvist, Hagiographic Dossier, p. 341 They were to leave late in the year, when the weather on the Black Sea was known to be treacherous, and Lazaropoulos hesitated to sail until St. Eugenios appeared to him in a dream and assured Lazaropoulos he would have a safe journey.Lazaropoulos, Synopsis, ll. 1699ff; translated in Rosenqvist, Hagiographic Dossier, p. 341 The party arrived in Trebizond 22 December.Panaretos, Chronicle, 15.

John was back in Trebizond by Easter Sunday, 13 April 1365. According to Michael Panaretos, John resigned his office on 15 November 1367, retiring to the monastery of Panagia Eleousa, close to the Daphnous harbor, next to Leonkastron; he was succeeded by a monk from Mount Athos, Theodosios of Thessalonica.

Ltd. was a company making model steam engines and other toys in Liverpool, UK. Founded by Ernest Claus around 1934, they made a small range of popular, well- made steam engines, many of which have survived to this day, including a range of steam-engine-powered model speed boats. Mersey Models exhibited at the British Industries Fair in 1936.Catalogue (British Industries Fair, 1936) The company offices were initially at 34 Peter's Lane in Liverpool and later in the Cooper's Building on Church Street. The factory was located across the River Mersey in Wallasey. Manufacturing stopped at the outbreak of the Second World War, in 1939, when the factory was needed for the war effort. The models remained on sale until 1941. Cooper's Building was damaged by fire after bombing on 6 May, 1941, but Mersey Models had already been wound up by then. Products Mersey Models' products were mainly steam powered models/toys and related accessories.Bowman Steam Toys and Pond Yachts, Book 2 - Colin Laker, (Headley of Ashford, 2009)A Brief History of Mersey Models One of the earliest known advertisements featuring a Mersey Models engine shows a Model 51 and was placed by Hamleys in the November 1934 issue of the Meccano Magazine. =Stationary engines= Stationary models that have been identified are 51, 52, 53, 54 and 55. Models 52, 53, 54, and 55 were available with options designated by suffixes on the model number: G = geared output, R = reversible, and D = dynamo. The R option was available for all 4 models, the G and GR options were only available for models 52 and 53, and the D option was only available with model 54. Model 51 did not have any options available.Meccano Magazine, November 1937 =Boats= Two boat models have been identified, although the main difference was just colouring. These were Miss Mersey I and II. The steam engine used in these boats was available separately, advertised as Mersey Steam Boat Engine No.2.Modeen Steam Models of Oldham - Colin Laker, (Headley of Ashford, 2014) =Accessories= Mersey Models included a small range of machine tool accessories in their catalogue. These included a grindstone, circular saw, power press, drilling machine and a lathe. These accessories are very rare today.Meccano Magazine, December 1937 =One-off models= There are some rare and one-off models which have been found and identified as having been made by Mersey, which were prototypes or special commissions. One example of this is an engine with a thermosetting plastic base. All other known Mersey models have wooden bases and the use of plastics in manufacturing was in its infancy at the time. Mersey advertised to the trade their ability to build special commissions to order.

He is often associated with the Jugendstil movement.  Life  From 1887 to 1890 he studied at the Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig and, from 1890 to 1892 was a student of Leon Pohle and Ferdinand Pauwels at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. After his studies, he became a free-lance painter in Mei√üen, where he received a stipendium, awarded to Saxon painters by the \\"Munkeltsche Legat\\". This enabled him to work for three years with no financial worries. In 1898, he presented his first large collection of paintings to the public. That same year, he was a prizewinner at a contest held by the entrepreneur Ludwig Stollwerck to select artists for a new line of trading cards. Hofacker, Prof. Karl: Kunstgewerbeblatt 9. Jahrgang, Leipzig, 1898. His first series of cards, \\"Jahreszeiten\\" (The Seasons), was published later that year. This was followed in 1900 by \\"Das Gewitter\\" (The Tempest). Four years later he, in turn, became a judge at a contest held by Stollwerck and Otto Henkell, selecting illustrations to use in joint advertising campaigns for their chocolate, cocoa and champagne.Hofacker, Prof. Karl: Kunstgewerbeblatt 15. Jahrgang, Leipzig, 1904. In 1902, at the invitation of his friend Rainer Maria Rilke, he spent some time at the art colony in Worpswede. From 1903, he served as a Professor at the Dresden Academy. He was described as thorough and pedantic and was an unshakable opponent of impressionism. Despite this, and his involvement with advertising, much of his work is openly erotic or has an eerie quality. His style has been likened to a contemporary version of Holbein or Cranach, but also contains elements of Art Nouveau.

It was constructed in 1928 as a private house, the Stickney Summer House, and renovated into the restaurant in the late 1950s; it now houses the Mission Table and Jolly Pumpkin Restaurants. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. History Charles Francis Stickney was born in 1868 in Groveland, Massachusetts, the son of Charles Stickney and Julia G. Noyes. He married Genevive (Jennie) E. Worthen in 1891. By 1900 the couple had moved to Chicago, where Stickney made a fortune in the steel and lumber industries. They soon began travelling to the Grand Traverse area, likely taking advantage of the Pere Marquette Railway summer trains that ran from Chicago to Petoskey, Michigan. In 1920, the Stickneys purchased this property, then a typical Old Mission Peninsula farm with a rather large orchard. They continued the farming use of the property and canned preserves from the orchard harvest, offering them for sale. In 1928, the Stickneys hired Jennie Stickney's nephew, Kenneth B. Worthen, to design a new summer house for their property. Worthern was at the time a principal of Bentley-Worthen Architects in St. Paul, Minnesota, and had made a name for himself by designing many large Twin City residences, many in a distinctive storybook English Cottage style. Worthern designed this 26-room Arts and Crafts, Storybook style house for the couple. The house was built at a cost of $175,000, and the Stickneys dubbed it the We-Gwa-Se-Min Ranch. Jennie Stickney died in 1947 in Grand Rapids, Michigan and Charles Stickney died two year later in Traverse City. In 1958, Jim and Fern Bryant purchased the Stickneys' property and converted the main house to a restaurant they called the \\"Bowers Harbor Inn.\\" The restaurant opened in 1959. In 1974, Howard A. Schelde and three business partners purchased the restaurant and renovated it. In 1978, they renovated the previously abandoned east portion of the structure to become a separate casual restaurant, \\"The Bowery.\\" In 2006, the property was purchased by Jon Carlson and Greg Lobdell, who again renovated the property. They added a microbrewery, turned the Bowery restaurant into The Jolly Pumpkin Restaurant, Microbrewery & Distillery, and turned the Bowers Harbor Inn Restaurant into the Mission Table Restaurant & Tasting Room. The building continues to house the two restaurants, one for fine dining and one casual. Description The Stickney Summer House is a large, two story frame Storybook style structure. It consists of the main 1928 house on the west, a \\"carriage house\\" on the east (which may have been constructed earlier), and an addition which connects the two separate structures. The main section of the house is approximately by and faces the lake. The east section, containing the \\"carriage house\\" and the connector addition, extends approximately to the east, giving the entire building a T shape. The front facade of the house has a central bay with a recessed entrance. The entrance has a heavy wooden door with iron strap hinges, surrounded by glass lights. Above the entrance is a pair of French doors opening onto a small balcony with a wrought iron railing. To the left of the entrance bay is a projecting bay holding a two-story porch with a shallow hip roof. To the right is a three-bay wide section with a central three-sided bay window flanked by a single tall window on each side. The north side of the house has three small first-floor windows and none on the second floor. This section was originally an open porch, but was enclosed in the 1960s. The south side of the house is dominated by a massive fieldstone and brick end chimney. A pair of French doors flank the chimney on the first floor, and an oriel window protrudes from the chimney's center at the second floor level. A concrete terrace runs across the entire front facade of the building and extends to the south side. The rear of the house is relatively featureless, with windows only on the second floor. An gable-roofed addition connects the house with a \\"carriage house\\" (now the Bowery Restaurant), which is a two-story hip roof structure. The interior of the structure has an Arts and Crafts look, with dark stained wood floors and wood trim throughout the restaurant. The front door opens onto an entrance hall with a flagstone floor and a curved staircase with a wrought iron railing. Arched doorways open from there onto two dining rooms. The south one has a polished flagstone floor, plaster walls, a wood cross beam ceiling, and a massive stone fireplace with a rustic beam mantel and flagstone hearth. The north dining room has a brick fireplace, wood cross beam ceilings, and a wooden bar. The upstairs contains rooms which were formerly bedrooms.

Historically, the work became a significant catalyst in motivating the development of mathematical structuralism.Stewart Shapiro (1997) Philosophy of Mathematics: Structure and Ontology New York: Oxford University Press, p. 37. The identification problem argues that there exists a fundamental problem in reducing natural numbers to pure sets. Since there exists an infinite number of ways of identifying the natural numbers with pure sets, no particular set- theoretic method can be determined as the \\"true\\" reduction. Benacerraf infers that any attempt to make such a choice of reduction immediately results in generating a meta-level, set-theoretic falsehood, namely in relation to other elementarily-equivalent set-theories not identical to the one chosen. The identification problem argues that this creates a fundamental problem for Platonism, which maintains that mathematical objects have a real, abstract existence. Benacerraf's dilemma to Platonic set-theory is arguing that the Platonic attempt to identify the \\"true\\" reduction of natural numbers to pure sets, as revealing the intrinsic properties of these abstract mathematical objects, is impossible. As a result, the identification problem ultimately argues that the relation of set theory to natural numbers cannot have an ontologically Platonic nature.  Historical motivations  The historical motivation for the development of Benacerraf's identification problem derives from a fundamental problem of ontology. Since Medieval times, philosophers have argued as to whether the ontology of mathematics contains abstract objects. In the philosophy of mathematics, an abstract object is traditionally defined as an entity that: (1) exists independent of the mind; (2) exists independent of the empirical world; and (3) has eternal, unchangeable properties.Michael Loux (2006) Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction (Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy), London: Routledge. Traditional mathematical Platonism maintains that some set of mathematical elements‚Äìnatural numbers, real numbers, functions, relations, systems‚Äìare such abstract objects. Contrarily, mathematical nominalism denies the existence of any such abstract objects in the ontology of mathematics. In the late 19th and early 20th century, a number of anti-Platonist programs gained in popularity. These included intuitionism, formalism, and predicativism. By the mid-20th century, however, these anti-Platonist theories had a number of their own issues. This subsequently resulted in a resurgence of interest in Platonism. It was in this historic context that the motivations for the identification problem developed.  Description  The identification problem begins by evidencing some set of elementarily-equivalent, set-theoretic models of the natural numbers. Benacerraf considers two such set-theoretic methods: ::Set- theoretic method I (using Zermelo ordinals) ::0 = ‚àÖ ::1 = = ::2 = = ::3 = = ::... ::Set-theoretic method II (using von Neumann ordinals) ::0 = ‚àÖ ::1 = = ::2 = = ::3 = = ::... As Benacerraf demonstrates, both method I and II reduce natural numbers to sets. Benacerraf formulates the dilemma as a question: which of these set-theoretic methods uniquely provides the true identity statements, which elucidates the true ontological nature of the natural numbers? Either method I or II could be used to define the natural numbers and subsequently generate true arithmetical statements to form a mathematical system. In their relation, the elements of such mathematical systems are isomorphic in their structure. However, the problem arises when these isomorphic structures are related together on the meta-level. The definitions and arithmetical statements from system I are not identical to the definitions and arithmetical statements from system II. For example, the two systems differ in their answer to whether 0 ‚àà 2, insofar as ‚àÖ is not an element of . Thus, in terms of failing the transitivity of identity, the search for true identity statements similarly fails. By attempting to reduce the natural numbers to sets, this renders a set-theoretic falsehood between the isomorphic structures of different mathematical systems. This is the essence of the identification problem. According to Benacerraf, the philosophical ramifications of this identification problem result in Platonic approaches failing the ontological test. The argument is used to demonstrate the impossibility for Platonism to reduce numbers to sets and reveal the existence of abstract objects.

Its primary objective has been to provide exposure to artists of the Lowbrow art movement (also sometimes referred to as Pop Surrealism and Newbrow) since its inception in 2007. The gallery space has exhibitions featuring talent from across the U.S. and abroad, as well as publications and specialty toy merchandise pertinent to Newbrow culture and related underground art movements. Art Whino avidly participates in the Washington, D.C. art scene, and other national art events such as Art Basel in Miami and New York Comic Con.  History  The Art Whino Gallery was founded by Shane Pomajambo in 2007. Originally located in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, it was later relocated six months later to its current location in Maryland. On Friday, October 19, 2007, Art Whino held its first opening reception for artist Derrick Wolbaum's solo show. On its Lowbrow genre, \\"According to Art Whino owner Shane Pomajambo, the unusual moniker is a nod to his own addiction to the graffiti-inspired, pop surrealist and 'lowbrow' art he specializes in.\\" Since its inception, Art Whino's presence has rapidly increased to including over 1200 artists in its arsenal.  Exhibitions  Art Whino holds exhibitions in its gallery space 8-10 times a year. Past featured artists have included Blaine Fontana, Aaron Jasinski, Brendan Tierney and many more. In efforts of bringing Newbrow art to surrounding communities, Art Whino has participated in many events around the city including Art in a Box, a juried exhibition hosted at the Half Street Fairgrounds, MarcƒÅtus, a creative art market, the annual D.C. (e)merge Art Fair, Miami Art Basel in 2009, and New York Comic Con in 2012. In 2012, Art Whino began a new collaborative event called Art without Borders as an international initiative to raise awareness and funds for international organizations providing humanitarian aid across the globe. = G40 Art Summit = In March 2010, Art Whino held its inaugural month-long G40 summit in Crystal City, Virginia partnering with Crystal City BID and Vornado. Part of its mission is to bring leaders of the Newbrow genre together to explore, discuss and grow the movement and serve as a full cross examination of this genre. the Summit featured curated works from around the world that also included music and visual performances, lectures and live painting. Held in an empty office building in Crystal City, Va., the 75,000 sq. ft. exhibition took up the four floors and lobby by some 2,000 artworks by over 500 artists. Art Whino returned mid-May the following year for the second edition of the G40 summit. The month-long event was held at a 25,000 sqft building near the U Street Corridor section of Washington, D.C. Unlike the first summit that mainly explored Newbrow art within a cultural and regional context, the 2011 edition extended its scope to other genres on the forefront of creative transitions and growing in large scale. Some of the genres included were customized collectibles, skateboard art, stencil, wheat paste and 3D installation art. This exhibition also featured 20 artists showcasing 16 foot murals. May 2012 marked Art Whino's third G40 installation focusing on the \\"Art of the Mural.‚Äù That year, the G40 summit travelled to Richmond, Virginia as the inaugural opening event of the city's official art district. Art Whino invited 12 of the top mural artists from around the globe to unleash their creativity to 20 large-scale walls throughout Richmond. Additionally, exhibitions were held in pop up galleries along the main street of the district as well as a group exhibition for 500+ artists. = Richmond Mural Project = Launched in 2012 with the help of R. Anthony Harris of RVA Magazine, Venture Richmond and the City of Richmond, the Richmond Mural Project is a yearly project bringing together mural artists from all over the globe in an attempt to establish Richmond, Virginia, as a landmark destination for internationally recognized murals and create exposure for the city. Many of the walls targeted are in disrepair and the Project aims to also be a positive catalyst for change in rebuilding the city as a whole. The Richmond Mural Project hopes to have 100 murals completed in five years within the city. The artists that participated in the first Richmond Mural project are 2501 from Italy, Angry Woebots from California, Aryz from Spain, Gaia from New York, Jaz from Argentina, La Pandilla from Puerto Rico, Lelo from Brazil, Pixel Pancho from Italy, Roa from Belgium, and Scribe from Kansas. With varying themes and locations throughout Richmond, the Project has aimed to help create an identity. On the selection, \\"Pomajambo said that if building owners agree to a mural, he asks them about the building and its history, as well as how they feel about their community. Then he tries to match artists who could best describe those feelings with paint.\\" Since its inception, the event has grown in popularity and has given rise to other arts-related events in the city. One mural, created by mural artist Etam Cru, \\"Moonshine\\", was ranked No. 3 in global publication Buzzfeed's \\"Best Street Art in the World of 2013\\" list.  Blind Whino  The Blind Whino church fully renovated Blind Whino is a non-profit organization located in a once defunct and abandoned building, Friendship Baptist Church, nestled in the heart of southwest Washington D.C. Purchased in October 2012 as a branch of the Art Whino Gallery, Blind Whino is a 15,000 sq. ft. property renovated with the intention to provide the community with an art inspired environment for both learning and creating within the arts culture. The exterior and interior of the now completed space was designed by renowned artist HENSE from Atlanta, Georgia and MEGGS from Australia. For over two decades, the former Friendship Baptist church had been vacant. The transformation process began in the fall of 2012 restoring the church from its previously peeling white paint to a brightly multi-colored building. Designed to host a variety of events, Ian Callendar, co-founder of the Blind Whino along with Shane Pomajambo stated, \\"Here‚Äôs a space where anything can happen ‚Äî theater, music, supper club, jazz, anything that you can imagine.\\" Working on the land outside of the Blind Whino is non- profit organization, Dreaming Out Loud, helping restore it for community utilization.

Pooser was born in 1893 at DeFuniak Springs, Florida. He attended public schools in the area. He was later a farmer, lawyer, schoolteacher, mover, and newspaper publisher. He ran the Times-courier in Marianna from 1947 to 1951 and another publication entitled Wankard Pooser's Bumblebee ‚Äì The Paper With A String, which ceased publication in 1958. Residing in Marianna, Florida, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives to represent Jackson County, Florida in 1944, with his term starting in 1945. It was said that his legislative goals were to \\"curb the growing tendency toward dictatorship in American Government, and to put some brakes on run-a-way taxes\\". He also made a campaign promise to reject every single bill that was presented to him, a promise which he would only stray from once in his legislative career.http://www.flahum.org/Assets/PDFs/Here_Today_Summer_Fall_2004.pdf In the 1945 legislative session, Pooser was involved in an incident in which he introduced a law in the house calling for additional regulation at Jackson County hospitals. When the bill was opposed by fellow member John Lambe, Pooser brought up the fact that Lambe's newborn child had died at a hospital earlier that week, causing Lambe to \\"break down\\" and withdraw from the debate. Pooser later apologized and requested to be excused from further attendance in that legislative session. Also notably, upon the passing of a sales tax bill in the house, Pooser dropped to the chamber floor and started praying for the taxpayers of Florida. Pooser was a critic of economic policy, with a newspaper describing him as a \\"stormy petrel of the economy bloc\\". He was also a vocal critic of the administration of the Governor of Florida, Fuller Warren. In 1946, Pooser was an unsuccessful candidate for the Florida State Senate; in that same election, his wife, Maude also ran unsuccessfully for the State House of Representatives. Pooser was defeated in 1949 for his seat in the house, and left the seat in 1950. He attempted a comeback in 1952, but was defeated in a primary by Hugh Dukes by a margin of 24 votes.\\"Pooser Hearing Being Conducted\\", Panama City News Herald, Thursday, August 07, 1952, Panama City, Florida, United States Of America He was married to Maude Marie Brogdon at Jackson County on August 15, 1915, and with her had eleven children. Pooser died at Jackson County in 1978 and was buried at Pope Cemetery in Sneads, Jackson County, Florida. He was predeceased by his wife, who died December 15, 1966 at the age of 68. In a 1958 article, Pooser referred to himself as a \\"famous author, statesman, [and] poet\\".

His tomb was discovered almost intact on 4 November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings in west Thebes by Howard Carter. Today the object, with the find number 261, is on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, with the inventory number JE 61444.  Discovery  The Anubis Shrine was found behind the unwalled entrance which lead from the Burial Chamber to the Treasury. The shrine, with a figure of the god Anubis on top, was facing towards the west. Behind it was the large canopic shrine containing the king's canopic chest and jars. During the work in the burial chamber, the entrance to the Treasury (called the Store Room by Carter in his diaries) was blocked with wooden boards, so that the work would not damage the objects in the Store Room. Investigating and clearing the Store Room began in the fifth excavation season (22 September 1926 ‚Äì 3 May 1927) and Carter first described the Anubis Shrine in his excavation journal on 23 October 1927. The Anubis Shrine in situ at the entrance of the Treasury  Anubis statue  The statue of Anubis, depicted in animal form as a recumbent jackal, is attached to the roof of the shrine. The statue is made from wood, covered with black paint. The insides of the ears, eyebrows, rims of the eyes, collar, and the band knotted around the neck are worked in gold leaf. The eyes are inlaid in gold; the whites of the eyes are made from calcite and the pupils from obsidian. The claws are made of silver. The Anubis statue was wrapped in a linen shirt which was from the seventh regnal year of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, according to ink hieroglyphs on it. Underneath it was a very fine linen gauze tied at the front of the neck. Over this were two thin floral collars of blue lotus and cornflowers, tied at the back of the neck. Between its front legs was an ivory writing palette inscribed with the name of Akhenaten's eldest daughter, Meritaten. The statue of Anubis was separated from the roof of the shrine on 25 October 1926 so that it could be transported through the burial chamber. The shrine on its sledge and the jackal were moved to the laboratory two days later on 27 October. The wood was noted to have shrunk over the intervening millennia, which had caused the gilded surface to bulge outwards. The surfaces and weakened areas were strengthened with wax. A very similar Anubis statue was found in the tomb of the pharaoh Horemheb (KV57). Made of cedar, the jackal once had inlaid eyes which are now missing, and was painted black with a gilded plaster collar. The body and paw of another jackal were also found, along with two fragmentary jackal heads. Unlike Tutankhamun's jackal, the claws were made of copper.  Shrine  The shrine is trapezoidal. In his records, Howard Carter called it a pylon because of its resemblance to the monumental temple gateways. Like the jackal, the shrine is also made of wood, with a layer of plaster covered with gold leaf. The top edge has an out- curving cavetto cornice with torus molding. The sides are decorated with djed pillars, a symbol of endurance which is linked closely with the god Osiris and tyet-knots, which can stand for life, like the ankh, and is a symbol of the goddess Isis. A design of recessed niches decorates the lower edge. Inscriptions run horizontally along the upper edge and vertically along the sides on all faces of the shrine. The inscriptions invoke two manifestations of Anubis: Imiut (Jmj wt ‚Äì \\"He who is in his wrappings\\") and Khenti-Seh-netjer (·∏™ntj-s·∏•-n·πØr ‚Äì \\"The first of the god's hall\\").Rolf Felde, √Ñgyptische Gottheiten. 2nd edition. R. Felde Eigenverlag, Wiesbaden 1995, p. 6. Inside the shrine are four small trays and a large compartment. The small trays contained cult objects consisting of faience forelegs, two mummiform figures, figures of Ra and Thoth, a faience papyrus column, a wax figure of a bird, pieces of resin, and two calcite cups containing a mix of salt, sodium sulfate, and natron, while the large compartment contained jewelry that had been wrapped in linen and sealed but had been disturbed by robbers.  Function and significance  Anubis seated on a tomb, symbolizing his protection of the necropolis The shrine was placed on a sledge-shaped palanquin, which had two carrying poles projecting from the front and back. It is therefore presumed that the Anubis shrine was used in the funerary procession of the Pharaoh and finally placed in front of the canopic chest in the Treasury. This and the orientation of the Anubis statue and shrine towards the west, the direction of the afterlife in Ancient Egyptian belief, show the role of the god Anubis as guardian of the necropolis. This is made clear by a small brick of unfired clay, known as a magic brick, found at the entrance to the Store Room, in front of the shrine. This was the fifth magic brick found in Tutankhamun's tomb. According to Carter, the brick was placed at the entrance to the Treasury for a reason, since the brick had a magic formula upon it, intended to protect the deceased: \\"It is I who hinder the sand from choking the secret chamber, and who repel that one who would repel him with the desert flame. I have set aflame the desert (?), I have caused the path to be mistaken. I am for the protection of the deceased.\\" The inscription on this brick was the origin of the Curse of the pharaohs, which was propagated in the international press of the time in many different versions rather than this original translation. The statue of the jackal lying on the shrine is in the same posture and form as one hieroglyph (Gardiner list: E16) for Anubis. However, this hieroglyph also signifies the title jnpw ·∏•rj-s≈°t»ù (\\"Anubis over the mysteries\\"), apparently with a double meaning: watcher and master of mysteries.

Unlike other known Ummidia species, it creates a trapdoor at the entrance of the burrow. Taxonomy and etymology U. algarve was misidentified by three authors, (O. Pickard-Cambridge (1908), Frade & Amelia Bacelar (1931) and Bacelar again (1937)), before Arthur Decae gave it its present (August, 2016) name, Ummidia algarve. Its specific name means \\"of Algarve\\", the region and Moorish medieval kingdom in South Portugal it was found in. The geographically inspired name was chosen because ctenizids are often endemic to certain specific regions.Decae, A. E. (2010). The genus Ummidia Thorell 1875 in the western Mediterranean, a review (Araneae: Mygalomorphae: Ctenizidae). Journal of Arachnology 38: 328-340. Biology Ummidia algarve is very common in Algarve, often in close association with nemesiid spiders. It has a burrow structure unique to the species (other than Conothele varvarti in India): a trapdoor at the entrance of the burrow and an inverted trapdoor near the bottom of the burrow. Females might be the only ones to do this. All other known Ummidia species have no internal structures other than the silk lining of the burrow. Description Female Ummidia algarve have short, straight, \\"mushroom-shaped\\" spermathecae and a warty texture to the abdominal cuticle. These warts are the individual sockets of bristles on the abdomen. The cephalothorax is smooth and shining. The chelicerae are large and dorsally black (ventrally orange-brown), with the fang serrated on the inner ridge. The cephalic area is smoothly elevated. The ocelli are arranged in two rows, near the anterior edge of the cephalothorax, set compactly around a small ocular process, the anterior row is strongly procurved and the posterior row is slightly recurved. Its total body length is 14.5 mm. Males have a relatively short, strong and smoothly curved embolus with a subapical fishhook tooth and low ocular quadrangle ratio. The cephalothorax is black with shades of red; it is also granulated. The opisthosoma is warty as in the female. The chelicerae are black dorsally and ventrally orange-brown.

Tress, G. Tres, G. Fry, and P. Opdam (eds.) From Landscape Research to Landscape Planning: Aspects of Integration, Education and Application. He taught for more than 40 years at the University of Illinois (1953‚Äì1963) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1964‚Äì1994). Charles Little, author of Greenways for America, describes Lewis as the \\"...most inventive (and occasionally controversial) figure in regional landscape planning theory in the country\\".  Early years  Lewis was born in Robinson, Illinois (20 miles from his hometown of Lawrenceville, Illinois), United States, on September 4, 1925. His father, Philip Howard Lewis Sr. (1890‚Äì1971), was an attorney who was a county judge and a state's attorney (1924‚Äì1930).\\"Obituary of Philip H. Lewis 1973\\". Lawrence Lore, Lawrence County, Illinois Historical Society Blog. His mother, Florence Sutfin Lewis (1900‚Äì1998), was a homemaker who worked at the First National Bank in Lawrenceville, Illinois. He had a younger sister, Gretchen.  Education  Lewis graduated from Lawrenceville Township High School in 1943. He enlisted in the Army Air Force upon graduation and completed a six-month training program at Hondo Air Base in Hondo, Texas, where he received navigation training. He completed his service with the Army Air Force in 1946. He attended the University of Illinois on the G.I. bill, receiving a bachelor's degree in landscape architecture in 1950. Influential figures during his undergraduate training included Stanley Hart White and Karl B. Lohmann. His education at the University of Illinois culminated in a trip to California to view contemporary landscape architecture projects with his favorite teacher, Hideo Sasaki. This trip included tours of gardens that had been designed by Thomas Dolliver Church and Garrett Eckbo. Following this trip, Lewis secured his first professional job as a landscape architect with the O. E. Goetz Nursery in Webster Groves, Missouri. After working at the Goetz Nursery, he attended Harvard Graduate School of Design, (1950‚Äì1953), where he earned a master's degree in landscape architecture. Lewis completed a summer internship with the National Park Service in 1952, where he learned about governmental agency interdisciplinary efforts to maintain the landscapes under their jurisdiction. His thesis focused on the Everglades Inventory and Development Study. On June 13, 1953, Lewis married Elizabeth Alice Thompson, a botany student at Radcliffe College. They were married for 58 years until her death on February 1, 2012.\\"Lewis, Elizabeth ‚ÄúLibby‚Äù Alice (Thompson)\\". Wisconsin State Journal, February 5, 2012. Accessed December 12, 2015. Lewis was awarded a Charles Eliot Traveling Fellowship in Landscape Architecture for his work on the Everglades. The fellowship allowed Lewis and his newlywed to travel to Europe for a year-long honeymoon and period of discovery. They viewed the landscapes of England, Scotland, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. These experiences sparked Lewis's interest in museums, communicating with the public, and the creation of spaces for buying local products.  Planning and teaching career  After returning from Europe, Lewis worked for the University of Illinois Bureau of Community Planning from 1953 to 1963. He taught City Planning Research with visiting professor Patrick Horsbrugh in the spring of 1957. Horsbrugh and Lewis became lifelong friends and colleagues. Lewis was the director of the Recreation and Open Space Study of Illinois from 1958 to 1961. Here he identified environmental corridors and landscape personalities that were used to guide planning efforts. He was recruited by Wisconsin Governor Gaylord Nelson to serve as the Director of the State of Wisconsin Recreation Resource, Research and Design, Department of Resource Development, where he served from 1963 to 1965. Environmental corridors were again identified in the Wisconsin State Recreation Plan to help guide planning decisions in the state. Lewis became the founder and director of the Environmental Awareness Center(EAC), part of the School of Natural Resources and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Lewis had joint appointments with the Department of Landscape Architecture, Department of Urban & Regional Planning, and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìExtension. Lewis also served as chair of the UW Landscape Architecture Department from 1964 to 1972 and taught undergraduate and graduate design courses. Shortly before his retirement in 1995 he served as the Jens Jensen Professor of Landscape Architecture. Lewis was a visiting professor in the School of Design at Harvard University from 1976 to 1977. Lewis contributed to the origins of geographic information systems technology with his application of maps using transparent overlays for environmental planning. The Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri) presented Lewis with its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. Lewis, along with Ian McHarg and Angus Hills, are credited with the development of the natural resource inventory approach and map overlays as a crucial part of the design process.Carl Steinitz, Paul Parker, and Lawrie Jordan. \\"Hand-Drawn Overlays: Their History and Prospective Uses\\", Landscape Architecture 66 (September 1976): 444-55Ndubisi, Forster.

The church has recently been recognized by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as a national historical site.  History The foundations of the church were first laid out on October 18, 1877 by the founding families of Angeles City led by of Don Mariano V. Henson, It was as laid out by city planners in the Spanish colonial era and now is one of the most distinctive landmarks of the city today because of its historical significance related to how it was built. The church was constructed from 1877 to 1896 by the \\"Polo y Servicio\\" labor system, defined as the forced and unpaid labor of the Filipino native people for 40 days per year to all males from 16‚Äì65 years old by the Spanish colonial government. The first mass was held in the half of the church that was finished by April 14, 1886. The second half of the church, which includes the building's distinctive dome, was finished on September 17, 1891. The twin bells were rung for the first time on February 12, 1896. The church was finally finished as it still stands today in October 1909. Its engineering and architectural skills were provided by Don Antonio de la Camara from Manila. The backyard of the church became the execution grounds from 1896-1898 in shooting down Filipino rebels and suspects by the Spanish forces. And it was also used by the U.S. Army as a military hospital from 1899 to 1900. The church's belfry was destroyed in the 1940s as a result of World War II. It was immediately restored by the government with the help of American troops and was finished by early 1944. Today, the Holy Rosary Parish Church serves as the city's main religious center, being located at the front of the former city hall, now known as the Museo ning Angeles. Local devotees flock the church and faithfully attend activities especially during Holy Week. Two of the awaited activities are the Good Friday Procession, where bare-footed followers of the Apung Mamacalulu, or the Holy Sepulchre join the procession in the city complex; and the Salubong, held at the Nepo Parking Lot, that ends with the traditional meeting of the Risen Christ and Virgin Mary amidst the fireworks.

Dan Udoutch serves as president and CEO of Alpine Data Labs. History Ex-Greenplum employees Anderson Wong and Yi-Ling Chen developed an app that could work with databases, which was used by the Data Science team at EMC as well as early customers in Financial Services and Digital Media. Alpine Data Labs was co- founded by Wong and Chen in 2010. That year, Alpine raised 7.5 million in Series A round funding from EMC Greenplum, Sierra Ventures, Mission Ventures, and Sumitomo Corp. Equity Asia. The funding was used in part to set up Alpine‚Äôs headquarters in San Mateo, California. Alpine also appointed its Chief Product Officer, Steven Hillion, who had led the Data Science team at Greenplum. Alpine's core product then, Alpine Miner, allowed for non-data scientists to create predictive analytics data models without using code and used an \\"In-Database\\" model. In June 2011, Alpine Miner 2.0 for Oracle Database was released. Tom Ryan was appointed CEO and president of Alpine Data Labs in January 2012 and served until April 2013. The following month, Joe Otto was appointed to serve as CEO and president. In November 2013, Alpine Data Labs raised $16 million in Series B venture funding. Investors included Sierra Ventures, Mission Ventures, UMC Capital, and Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH. That same month, it also released Alpine 3.0, which introduced a drag and drop interface and access to data from any device that with internet capabilities, including tablets and phones. This makes it possible for analysts to access data on Hadoop, and other databases and data warehouses, without IT having to move the data into another interface. Alpine also moved its headquarters from San Mateo to San Francisco in November 2013, by which point the company had significantly expanded the functional breadth of its platform with enterprise collaboration and governance features. In February 2014, Alpine Data Labs was added to the Gartner Magic Quadrant as a \\"Niche Player\\" and later as a \\"Visionary\\". In 2014, the company released an integration with the R programming language, as well as support for all major Hadoop distributions and all major relational databases.

The Serra de Moixer√≥ is often confused as a part of the Serra del Cad√≠, despite the fact that these two ranges are separated by the Tancalaporta pass.

Geography Since Moixer√≥ is considered older than the Cad√≠ range (it formed during the Variscan orogeny during the Paleozoic era), it is considered the start of the \\"axial\\" Pyrenees, beginning at the Pass of Pend√≠s (1,760 m). From there, it continues to Tosa d'Alp and Puigllan√ßada, to beyond the Pas of Toses. Along with the adjacent ranges, it divides the watersheds of the Llobregat and Segre rivers. The range's most significant peaks are the Tur√≥ de Pratagre (2,012 m), Moixer√≥ (2.078 m), the plateau of Moixer√≥ (2,063 m), the Penyes Altes de Moixer√≥ (2,276 m), the Serrat de la Miquela (2,161 m), Soquetes (2.181 m), and the pass of Jou (2,000 m), near the foothills of Tosa d'Alp. The northern slopes of the ridge descend gradually to the plain of Cerdanya, with numerous streams descending the slopes. The southern slopes of the Serra de Moixer√≥ are located in Bergued√†, and are drained by the Gr√©ixer stream, a tributary of the Bastareny. This river cuts perpendicularly to the range, which has created a series of descending plateaus parallel to the east- west direction of the ridge. Uniquely, around the Gr√©ixer, the principal stone is variegated effusive rhyolite; in most of the rest of the range, Devonian limestone are found at peaks while carboniferous schist is more plentiful at lower elevations and to the east. Climate and vegetation At lower elevations, the most common flora on Moixer√≥ includes red pine and fir, with small scattered stands of beech. After 1,800 metres black pine becomes more common, and after 2,000 metres, the ridges are mostly covered with mountain meadows or simply whitish rocks, depending on the local climate.

They are a blend of psychedelic rock and sixties girl group harmonies. The name Habibi means \\"my love,\\" an Arabic word vocalist Rahill Jamalifard grew up using despite her Iranian origin (the term is not in use in Iran).  Career  In 2011, former Detroiters, Lenaya Lynch and Rahill Jamalifard, decided to form a band blending their love of psychedelic garage rock and girl group harmonies. They joined Erin Campbell and Karen Isabel, musicians from the Brooklyn rock and roll scene, who both went to LaGuardia School of the Arts. They grew in popularity and found themselves playing the SXSW festival in Austin and the CMJ festival. They signed to Born Bad Records and released the self-titled 7-inch, Habibi. In 2012, Habibi's song \\"Sweetest Talk\\" was featured in actor/director James Franco's short film series Episodes of an Untitled Film. Lynch left the band due to an emergency in 2012 and Habibi found a replacement with the guitarist Caroline Partamian, who toured with the band for a year and until the return of Lynch in 2013. In 2014, Burger Records released their debut full-length LP, Habibi.  Influences  The sound of Habibi is influenced both by the garage rock/girl group sounds from Detroit as well as the Middle Eastern melody structures that were shared by Lynch and Jamalifard, who is herself of Iranian descent. Jamalifard influences are also related to her ancestry mentioning ‚ÄúIran, gypsies, nomads, the inspiration of poets like Hafez . . . my travels within the country.‚Äù In 2012, Interview Magazine wrote \\"Influenced by grunge, punk, hip-hop, and Motown, Habibi's sound‚Äîand band members‚Äîmeet somewhere in the middle.\\"  Members  = Current line-up = * Rahill Jamalifard - Lead Vocals, Tambourine * Lenaya \\"Lenny\\" Lynch - Guitar, Vocals * Erin Campbell - Bass, Guitar, Vocals * lyla vander - Drums * Leah Beth Fishman - Guitar, Vocals = Past members = * Caroline Partamian - Guitar, Vocals  Discography  =Studio albums= *Habibi (2014) *Anywhere But Here (2020) =EPs= *Habibi (2012) *La Luz / Habibi (2015) *Cardamom Garden (2018)  See also  * Burger Records discography  References  Category:Musical groups established in 2011 Category:Musical groups from Brooklyn Category:2011 establishments in New York City ","title":"Habibi (band)"},{"id":"42149142","title":"Rowing at the 2014 South American Games"},{"id":"42149143","text":"Eglington may refer to: People *Nathan Eglington (born 1980), Australian hockey player *Richard Eglington (1908‚Äì1979), English cricketer *Tommy Eglington (1923‚Äì2004), Irish footballer *Eglington Margaret Pearson (c. 1746 ‚Äì 1823), English stained glass painter Other uses *Eglington Cemetery, Clarksboro, New Jersey, U.S. See also *Eglinton (disambiguation) *John Eglington Bailey (1840‚Äì1888), English antiquary *Egling, a municipality in Bavaria, Germany fr:Eglington ","title":"Eglington"},{"id":"42149149","text":"Bujdos√≥, commonly known in English as The Fugitive or Song of Exile, is an early vocal composition by Hungarian composer Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. It was finished in 1946 and is strongly influenced by B√©la Bart√≥k.  Composition  This composition was written in 1946. At that time, Ligeti was living in Hungary and was very interested in Hungarian folk music, as other Hungarian composers such as B√©la Bart√≥k. As most of Ligeti's juvenilia, this piece never received a formal premiere, but it has been recorded together with other early vocal compositions. It was later published by Schott Music in 1999.  Analysis  This work takes approximately two minutes to perform. It is scored for a mixed choir which should consist of sopranos, altos, and baritones. The text is extracted from a Hungarian traditional poem, which is as follows: F√∂lkelt m√°r a csillag Lengyelorsz√°g fel√© Magam is elmegyek, bab√°m, arra fel√© Megvetett√©k nekem a megfog√≥ h√°l√≥t Megfogtak engemet mint egy uton√°ll√≥t L√°m, megmondtam, r√≥zs√°m, ne szeress engemet mert Somogy v√°rmegye hajszoltat engemet A t√∂ml√∂c feneke az √©n vetett √°gyam annak a teteje takar√≥ v√°nkosom. The piece is marked Nyugodtan (‚ô© = 108), which can be translated as \\"calmly\\". Tempo changes to Adagio towards the end of the piece, and time signature changes are present throughout the whole composition. The lyrics have been translated into German by Hilgen Schallehn and into English by Desmond Clayton.

Woods has been involved in rugby since the age of three. He began as a ball boy for the Enfield Federals, his father's team, and the following year joined the under-6s rugby league. He later played junior rugby league for St George, serving the Jersey Flegg and under-23s as a captain. He also appeared as a reserve player for the Penrith Panthers and the Parramatta Eels, respectively from 1989-1997 and 1998-2001. He began coaching while still in junior rugby league. He took two teams to premierships in Parramatta, the Greystanes Devils to the under-17s C-grade and Merrylands to the top tier. After that, he became a development coach for the Penrith Panthers, which led eventually to his coaching the Castleford Tigers. In the 2005 season, the team achieved the National League One title and, under his direction, was promoted to Super League. Woods was then released by the Tigers because they wanted a better known coach to guide them in their Super League career. He later coached Gateshead Thunder and in his second season took them bottom of the table to champions of Championship 1. That year, he was awarded the National League Two Coach of the Year award. However, immediately thereafter, he was released by Gateshead Thunder. For several years, Woods left full-time rugby as he pursued a constructive dismissal case against the Gateshead Thunder that became complicated when bankruptcy affected the club. During that time, he served as the Great Britain Community Lions Under-18s coach for the Rugby Football League. In April 2010, Woods joined the York City Knights, first as a part- time director of rugby and then, two months later, as coach. His contract was terminated in September 2011. In 2013, Woods took over as coach for the Whitehaven team.

Its apparent magnitude varies from 10.2 to 12.7 over a period of 624.5 days. Although the binary is a symbiotic star system, it is unusual in that it does not have an eruptive component. It is an S-type symbiotic system, which means that the light comes from the stars rather than surrounding dust. With optical spectrometry, the red giant has been calculated as having a surface temperature of 3500 K and spectral type M4.5III, with around 1.3 times the Sun's mass, 86 times its radius and 1000 times its luminosity. The white dwarf is only 0.43 times the mass of the Sun. The two stars are 1.72 astronomical units (AU) apart, and take 624 days to orbit each other. The red giant also pulsates with a period of 56 days. The surface of the giant star extends to 40% of the distance to the Lagrange point L1, and hence does not fill its Roche Lobe and cause the white dwarf to gain an accretion disc. The system was calculated at being around 850 parsecs (2771 light-years) distant.

Life Erich von der Heyde was born on 1 May 1900 in Hong Kong, then a British colony. The von der Heyde family moved to Germany in 1906, where he attended school in Bremen and Weimar until May 1918. He served in the military until the end of World War I, after which he studied agronomy for five years at the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen. In 1925, he worked for a hailstorm insurance company. He changed jobs in 1926, joining the agricultural department of IG Farben in Ludwigshafen. In 1934, he joined the SS mounted unit, the Reitersturm, and left it in 1936. However, he was still a member of the SS. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937. During 1936, von der Heyde became the advisor for nitrogen and agriculture in the Political-Economic Policy Department (WIPO, Wirtschaftspolitische Abteilung) of the I.G. in Berlin. From mid-1938 he was also the counterintelligence operative of I.G. Farben‚Äôs ‚ÄúNW 7‚Äù (intelligence) office, where his duties included counterintelligence and taking action against breaches of secrecy. In addition, he passed on reports from abroad that appeared to be of general interest, distributing them internally at the I.G. and sending them to the Wehrmacht. In this capacity, he was borrowed by the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA, Reichssicherheitshauptamt) and by 1940 had been promoted to Hauptscharf√ºhrer. In September 1940, he was called up for service in the Wehrmacht, and until the war‚Äôs end he served in the military-economic branch of the War Economy and Armament Office (Wehrwirtschafts- und R√ºstungsamt; and later the War Economy Staff, or Wehrwirtschaftsstab). =Post-war= In 1948 at the IG Farben Trial in Nuremberg, von der Heyde was acquitted on the charges of plundering, spoliation, and mass murder. Unlike many SS members, he was not charged with membership in a criminal organization (the SS), because the SS-Reitersturm had not been classified as criminal.

There are more than 200 different versions of the legend. The most well-known version was written by Philippe-Joseph Aubert de Gasp√©, in 1837 in Le chercheur de tr√©sor ou l'influence d'un livre. This version recounts the story of Rose Latulipe, a young and frivolous girl who loved to dance. On the night of Mardi Gras, a stranger showed up at the Latulipe house and danced with Rose until the stroke of midnight. The stranger is revealed to be the Devil. According to some versions, the Devil disappeared, taking Rose with him to Hell. According to other versions, the priest of the village intervened, saving her. She would subsequently enter a convent and die a few years later. The legend is one of many examples in French Canadian folklore of girls 'dancing with the devil.' The stories may have served as cautionary tales for young girls about the dangers of dancing with strangers who could be criminals, particularly during Lent or on Sundays.

The congregation was divided when the Romsey Congregational Church was established in 1893 to serve congregants living closer to Savin Hill; the two congregations were reunited in 1930, and stained glass windows from the Romsey Church were installed in this building. The Pilgrim Church was subjected to a severely damaging fire in October 1970. Although it was restricted to the sanctuary, there was extensive water and smoke damage, and five stained glass windows (including the three from the Romsey Church) were destroyed. The congregation decided to rebuild the main sanctuary as a multipurpose fellowship hall, and now worships in the chapel. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

The brick Renaissance Revival building was constructed in 1909 by the Boston Elevated Railway (a predecessor to today's MBTA) during the extension of the Washington Street Elevated to Forest Hills. The building is long, wide, and high. Its most prominent feature is the massive archway that frames the main entrance on Washington Street. The building was designed by Robert S. Peabody of Peabody and Stearns. The building was use by the Boston Elevated and its successors to provide AC to DC conversion for streetcars and elevated trains until 1987, at which time it was one of the oldest such substations in the nation. The building was essentially abandoned and fell into disrepair, with its roof in failure in 2005. It was then acquired by local nonprofits, who have converted it for use as office and television studio space. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

Scientific education  Drinkard received a Bachelor of Arts degree at Huntingdon College in 1950, followed by a Master of Science at Alabama Polytechnic Institute in 1952. He earned his Ph.D. degree at the University of Illinois in 1956. Initially, he was an assistant professor at UCLA prior to becoming an industrial research scientist at the DuPont Co at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware.Marquis Who's Who On Demand, accessed March 13, 2014.  Scientific career  With impetus from research director Frank McGrew, Drinkard invented a robust nickel-based catalyst system with a co- catalyst that formed the basis of an industrial preparation of adiponitrile based on addition of hydrogen cyanide to butadiene.William C. Drinkard, Jr., United States Patent 3,496,218 (1970). Further refinements of Drinkard's initial discovery by other members of DuPont's research staff led to a commercially viable catalyst composition, one that afforded significant cost advantage over the next best alternative. This innovation provided an important competitive advantage. In the chemical pathway depicted below, the letters a, b, and c indicate steps mediated by Drinkard's catalyst. :Butadiene hydrocyanation Drinkard was awarded the Lavoisier Medal of the DuPont Company in 1997.

Sales tax tokens were fractional cent devices used to pay sales tax on very small purchases in many American states during the years of the Great Depression. Tax tokens were created as a means for consumers to avoid being \\"overcharged\\" by having to pay a full penny tax on purchases of 5 or 10 cents. Issued by private firms, by municipalities, and by twelve state governments, sales tax tokens were generally issued in multiples of 1 mill ( cent).Brian Rxm, \\"Sales Tax Tokens: US State issues during the 1930s Depression,\\" Brian Rxm website, www.brianrxm.com/ History =Background= Prior to the coming of World War I in the summer of 1914, only two countries, Mexico and the Philippines, made use of a general sales tax for national finance.National Industrial Conference Board, General Sales Tax or Turnover Tax. New York: National Industrial Conference Board, 1929; pg. 163. Excise tax ‚Äî a transaction tax on the sale of specific items ‚Äî was broadly used, however, and the idea of a general sales tax was neither unknown nor obscure to political decision-makers in the United States. Indeed, in 1921 there was a concerted effort to implement a 1% national sales tax in the USA by attaching it to the 1921 national revenue bill and 1922 legislation providing for a soldiers' bonus.Merllin K. Malehorn and Tim Davenport, United States Sales Tax Tokens and Stamps: A History and Catalog. Bryantown, MD: Jade House Publications, 1993; pg. 9. Although the proposals for a national sales tax were defeated by an alliance of farmer and labor interests, the state of West Virginia implemented a 1% sales tax of its own in that same year, using the revenue so generated as a replacement for a corporate income tax. Improving economic conditions throughout that decade of the 1920s would leave West Virginia's use of a sales tax unique among the 48 American states. In October 1929 the global economic crisis struck the United States. As unemployment skyrocketed, income tax revenue plummeted and defaults on property taxes spiked. Meanwhile, calls for state spending on relief measures for the indigent and the unemployed expanded beyond the states' capabilities.Malehorn and Davenport, 'United States Sales Tax Tokens and Stamps, pg. 10. Georgia's early adoption of a sales tax in 1929 was followed by a wave of sales tax adoptions, spurred on by the deep financial crisis. In 1933, 11 more states, including New York, Illinois, California, and Michigan, adopted sales taxes. =Launch of sales tax tokens= An aluminum sales tax token from the state of Washington, valued at 2 mills ( cent) and good for the \\"tax on purchase of 10 cents or less\\" under the state's 2% retail sales tax law. The twelve states that issued these sales tax tokens were Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, and Washington. In addition to the fractional cent tokens used elsewhere, a closely related system of state-issued paper sales tax stamps and punch cards was used in the state of Ohio.Monte C. Dean, Ohio Sales Tax Revenues: Stamps, Punch Cards, Tokens and Related Memorabilia. Spring Valley, MN: Monte Dean, 2012. Sales tax tokens were generally regarded as a nuisance by consumers and were replaced in fairly short order by the bracket system of sales tax collection, which averaged out the tax on small sales.Chester M. Edelmann, \\"Bracket Systems and Sales Under One Dollar,\\" Proceedings of the Annual Conference on Taxation under the Auspices of the National Tax Association, vol. 43 (1950), pp. 307-314.

The number of types issued is counted in the hundreds, with mintages of some of these types ranging upwards into the tens of millions. Consequently, tax tokens are regarded by numismatists as ubiquitous and often are of comparatively little value. On the other hand, certain types and varieties are extremely rare, with as few as one specimen known. In 1971 collectors of sales tax tokens founded an organization called the American Tax Token Society, which has published a quarterly newsletter continuously since its foundation. =Catalogs= In addition to a number of early check-lists of available tokens, there have been two comprehensive catalogs published for collectors of sales tax tokens.Monte Christo Dean, Sales Tax Tokens and Scrip: Histories.

Bailey, using the pen name Ruth Rover, wrote one of the earliest literary works published in Oregon, The Grains, or, Passages in the Life of Ruth Rover, with Occasional Pictures of Oregon, Natural and Moral. According to historian Edwin Bingham in the foreword to the 1986 edition, Grains is \\"part autobiography, part religious testimonial, part history and travelogue\\", but \\"by stretching the definition, The Grains may be called a novel, the first novel written and published on the Pacific coast.\\" Early life Margaret Jewett Smith was born in Saugus, Massachusetts in about 1812. She converted to Methodism when she was 17 at a camp meeting. She attended the Methodist Episcopal Wesleyan Academy in Wilbraham over the objections of her family, especially her father, who wished for her to care for him in his old age and who threatened to disown her. She hoped she could become a missionary teacher among the Native Americans. Move to Oregon Country Smith came to the Oregon Country to join the Methodist Mission in September 1837 with the Reverend David Leslie, his wife Mary, their children, and the Reverend H. K. W. Perkins. Smith, who worked as a teacher, was the only unmarried white woman at the mission, thus the mission authorities pressured her to marry. She was courted by William H. Willson and was engaged to him for a time, but she refused to marry him after learning he had also written to another woman, Chloe Clark, asking her to come to Oregon to become his wife. Smith insisted on waiting to marry Willson until it was known if the other woman was coming to Oregon. Willson became impatient and asked Smith to falsely confess that they had fornicated so that they would be allowed to marry immediately. Smith refused, but Willson told the other members of the mission that they had sinned together. Smith, unable to prove her innocence, left the mission. In 1839, Smith married William J. Bailey, an early pioneer and later politician who did not belong to the mission. Willson married Chloe Aurelia Clark the following year. Smith lived with Bailey on their farm in French Prairie and became a regular contributor of prose and poetry to the Oregon Spectator beginning in 1846. On April 12, 1854, Margaret divorced William because of his drinking and abuse. The Grains In order to tell her side of the story about her association with the Methodist mission and her divorce from William Bailey, Margaret Bailey wrote The Grains in an attempt to clear her name. According to Bailey, as she writes in the first chapter of Grains, \\"I am avoided and shunned, and slighted, and regarded with suspicions in every place till my life is more burdensome than death would be.\\" The Grains was intended to be published in monthly installments, but only two volumes were issued, in August and September 1854 by Carter & Austin in Portland, Oregon. Bailey was already known to some Oregon readers by the time The Grains was published because of her work in the Spectator (signed \\"MJB\\"), and her letters home that were printed in Boston- and New York-based Christian newspapers as early as 1838. Bailey became the first local poet to be published west of the Rocky Mountains when her poem \\"Love\\" appeared in the first issue of the Spectator on February 5, 1846. After her divorce, Bailey edited six columns of the \\"Ladies Department\\" for the Spectator from May to June 1854. In her first column, Bailey expressed her desire to publish a paper exclusively for women. She did not publish any writing after Grains, however. The Grains, published two years before Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, is like that work a social protest, which criticizes Jason Lee and the mission community, as well as the mission's failure to convert the local Native Americans, and discrimination against women. According to the editors of the 1986 edition, Bailey's account of the facts of her life with the mission is accurate, although her interpretation of the events was sometimes biased. For example, she attributed the many misfortunes that befell David Leslie and his family (fires, the death of his wife and several children, illnesses) to divine retribution for his ill treatment of her. Per the editors of the 1986 reprint of the novel, although the heroine of the book is named \\"Ruth Rover\\", \\"there seems to have been no doubt in anyone's mind at the time of its publication that this book was a thinly disguised autobiography of Margaret Jewett (Smith) Bailey\\". The book drew on letters and her diary and journal entries, but she disguised the names of many of the principal characters (Willson becomes \\"Wiley\\", Leslie becomes \\"Leland\\", and Bailey becomes \\"Binney\\".) At the time of its release, Bailey's book received poor reviews and according to some scholars, most of the copies were destroyed. Most of the criticism of Bailey's work was due to her being a woman and a divorcee. The Grains, which was considered a \\"lost\\" work, was republished in a single volume by the Oregon State University Press in 1986 and was produced by combining the last three known copies in existence with a separately published story. A review of the 1986 edition notes that as a primary source, the book is a \\"fascinating (if seamy) insight into the workings of both daily life and internecine warfare at the 'Oregon Mission'\\". The reviewer thinks the book is less successful as a domestic novel such as those written by contemporaries Susan Warner and Mary Jane Holmes. Later life Bailey married Francis Waddle in Polk County in 1855 and they divorced in 1858. Bailey later moved to the Washington Territory and married a man named Crane. Bailey died in poverty in Seattle on May 17, 1882, as Margaret J. Crane. Other early Northwest works Although Bailey's Grains is considered by many scholars to be the first novel published in Oregon, and she is the first Oregon woman writer to appear in print, several other early works are often mentioned as part of the literary foundation of what became the Northwestern United States. In March 1838, Anna Maria Pittman Lee wrote the first poem in Oregon, a farewell to her husband Jason Lee. In 1843, the novel Prairie Flower was written by Sidney Walter Moss, and was probably the first novel written in Oregon. Moss, who was from Oregon City, sent the manuscript with a friend to the east coast where it was published by Stratton & Barnard in Cincinnati, Ohio under the name Emerson Bennett, a well-known author of the time. In 1852, the satiric political play Treason, Strategems, and Spoils, A Melodrame in Five Acts by Breakspear (William Lysander Adams) was published in five installments in The Oregonian and appeared later as a pamphlet. James G. Swan's The Northwest Coast, or, Three Years' Residence in Washington Territory was published in 1856.

History The site was chosen in 1936 as one of a number of less vulnerable locations for storing ordnance and other military equipment previously kept at London‚Äôs Woolwich Arsenal. This was designed to provide employment in what was then a depressed area, following the closure of the Lilleshall Company‚Äôs New Yard engineering works in St George's several years earlier. By 1980 COD Donnington (along with COD Bicester) was one of just two remaining Central Ordnance Depots overseen by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps; nevertheless, in the 1970s and 80s, it grew to be one of the largest military store complexes in Europe. It remains in use as a storage depot, although the complex was scaled back following two serious fires (in 1983 and 1988). At the turn of the millennium further investment took place as Parsons Barracks (named after Major-General Sir Harold Parsons) and Venning Barracks (named after General Sir Walter Venning) were developed. The base housed the Historic Weapons Collection until it moved to Maldon, Essex in 2010. In March 2014 there was reason for local optimism that MoD Donnington would once more be radically expanded with another 500 to 700 jobs being added to the 1,000 jobs that MoD Donnington currently requires. The expansion plans were approved early that month. In 2015 Donnington was selected as the site for a new 'Defence Fulfilment Centre' for the newly-privatised Logistics, Commodities and Services element of Defence Equipment and Support. The new office and warehouse buildings are being built alongside the former Defence Storage Distribution Centre on the site and are due to open in late 2016. In November 2014 Venning Barracks became headquarters of the newly-formed 11th Signal Brigade and Headquarters West Midlands, formed by the amalgamation of 11th Signal Brigade who were already based here since 1992, and the hitherto Shrewsbury-headquartered 143rd (West Midlands) Regional Brigade. In September 2016, it was announced Parsons and Venning Barracks sites were among 13 sites named by the Ministry of Defence for future disposal. In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the Parsons and Venning Barracks sites would close, with an \\"Estimated Date of Disposal\\" in 2020. This was later extended to 2022.

He jumped to his death on May 1, 1988, after allegations from staff members emerged that led to implications that he was in a homosexual relationship with Dyson. Following the suicide, Dyson's office was linked to illegal contributions and bribes for the defense subcontractor, Unisys, to receive favorable appropriations contracts through Dyson's position on the Defense Appropriations Committee. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Operation Ill Wind resulted in the conviction of key Department of the Navy Political Appointees who had close ties to Pappas and Dyson. Background Tom Pappas was the chief of staff and campaign coordinator to former congressman Roy Dyson. Mr. Pappas was investigated by the FEC for allegations that he had campaign contribution checks written to staff members which they then cashed and returned directly to Mr. Pappas. In light of the allegations that could implicate Dyson and other members in the office, several staff members, including the Press Secretary, Scott Ourth, accused Mr. Pappas in a Washington Post article of unorthodox management practices. The allegations against Mr. Pappas and congressman Dyson by staff members led to accusations that the two were in a homosexual relationship. The congressman denied the homosexual allegations and claimed that the accusations were made in malice. The day the Washington Post published the article with the homosexual hazing practices, Mr. Pappas jumped to his death from his hotel room during a New York trip to a Unisys factory. The office of congressman Dyson was later linked to improper contributions and connections to an illegal procurement of Navy Contracts in Operation Ill Wind. The day of his suicide, Tom Pappas was with the congressman on a trip sponsored by Unisys. The defense contractor was later implicated in a scheme of providing campaign contributions and bribes to key individuals for favorable treatment receiving contracts despite protests against the program from the Navy. The company provided Roy Dyson with $17,000 in campaign contributions. In a federal investigation it was revealed that Dyson and his staff received trips and compensation for providing favorable appropriations to Unisys. Outcome Charles Gardner, a former Unisys officer with close contact to the Congressman, was convicted and sentenced in the scheme. Also convicted in the scheme were Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Melvyn Paisley, Deputy Assistant of the Navy, James E. Gaines and Deputy Assistant of the Air Force Victor D. Cohen. Despite the link to the convicted Unisys lobbyist and the search warrants executed against the Congressman's office, neither Dyson or members of is staff were indicted in the scandal. Dyson did return campaign contributions to Unisys and paid a fee for to the FEC for the improper campaign collections from his staff. The scandal led the United States Congress to pass the 1988 Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates the pay that procurement officials can get from contractors during the first year after they leave government, and forbids them to provide bid and proposal information to their new employers.

The limestone stela with the inventory number JE 44865 is 43.5 √ó 39 cm in size and was discovered by Ludwig Borchardt in Haoue Q 47 at Tell-el Amarna in 1912.Wilfried Seipel im Ausstellungskatalog Nofretete - Echnaton, Nr. 47 When the archaeological finds from Tell-el Amarna were divided on 20 January 1913, Gustave Lefebvre chose this object on behalf of the Egyptian Superintendency for Antiquities (the modern Supreme Council of Antiquities) instead of the Bust of Nefertiti.  Description  On the left side Akhenaten sits on a stool, handing a jewel to his eldest daughter, Meritaten, who stands in front of him. Nefertiti sits opposite him, on the right hand side, playing with two of their daughters on her lap. These are Meketaten and Ankhesenpaaten. In the upper part, in the middle of the stela is the disk of the Aten, whose rays end in hands holding the symbol of life (Ankh) and are thereby depicted as life-bringing. In the background there are various inscriptions with the names and titles of the people depicted. The stela is bordered on three sides by a band of further hieroglyphs, marked with blue paint, which still partially survives. At the base of the stela are small holes on both sides which indicate that the stela was fitted with wings on each side. The so-called \\"Doctrinal name\\" of the Aten used here is still in its first form. The stela's dating to the end of the first half of Akhenaten's reign follows from this, as well as the depiction of the daughters and stylistic features typical of the Amarna period. Such stelae are typical of the Amarna period in Ancient Egypt and are found particularly in the graves at Amarna, which was the capital of Egypt under Akhenaten, with the name Akhetaten. These stelae were altars, which were placed in private chapels or houses for the worship of the royal family and the sun-god Aten.  Allegations of forgery  In an interview for Der Spiegel in 2009 in connection with a claim that the Bust of Nefertiti is a forgery, the Egyptologist Rolf Krauss argued that the bust is most likely authentic, while this stela is not. As a basis for his view, Krauss claimed, among other things, that the word Maat (truth, justice) is written incorrectly in four places. He further criticised the depiction of Akhenaten as left handed, which in his view is contrary to ancient Egyptian iconography. The yellow weathering on the stone was claimed to be fake, not a patina, with the support of colour analysis. Another Egyptologist, Christian Loeben commented favourably, \\"The relief is a pastiche, a fraudulently manufactured stylistic mishmash\\"\\"Krimi um die K√∂nigin\\"; Matthias Schulz, in Der Spiegel, Issue No.22 of 25 May 2009, pages 134-135  Bibliography  * Das √Ñgyptische Museum von Kairo. von Zabern, Mainz 1986, , No. 167. * Wilfried Seipel in Exhibition catalogue Nofretete - Echnaton. von Zabern, Mainz 1976, Nr. 47. * Cyril Aldred.

Classical regions of Asia Minor/Anatolia Regions of Asia Minor/Anatolia, c. 500 BC. Aegean Greek settlements italicised This is a list of peoples who inhabited Anatolia in antiquity. The essential purpose of the list is to identify prehistoric cultures in the region but many of the peoples continued to inhabit Anatolia into and through classical and late antiquity, so the actual scope of the list encompasses the history of Anatolia from prehistory to the Eastern Roman Empire (4th to 7th centuries AD), during which transition to the early medieval occurred. Anatolia was inhabited by numerous races and its history is characterised by folk movement and migration. Broadly, the peoples can be split linguistically between those who spoke a proto-Indo- European language, such as proto-Anatolian or proto-Greek, and those who spoke a language outside of the Indo-European family such as Kartvelian or Kaskian. The Indo-Europeans are further sub-divided into those who may be termed Anatolian natives and those whose origins were elsewhere.

It is represented by the single type species Megalophthalma ockerti from the Middle Triassic Erfurt Formation in southern Germany, which is itself based on a single partial skull and a fragment of the lower jaw. Megalophthalma is distinguished from other temnospondyls by its very large orbits or eye sockets, which occupy most of the skull and are bordered by thin struts of bone. Like those of most plagiosaurids, the skull flat, wide, and roughly triangular. The orbits are pentagon-shaped. The bones at the back of the skull (the occiput) are highly modified and show similarities with those of the plagiosaurid Plagiosternum. Both Megalophthalma and Plagiosternum lack prefrontal and postfrontal bones. In fact, Megalophthalma and Plagiosternum are thought to form their own clade or evolutionary grouping within Plagiosauridae called Plagiosterninae. In overall form Megalophthalma and Plagiosternum are intermediate between the basal plagiosaurid Plagiosuchus (which more closely resembles non-plagiosaurid temnospondyls) and the derived Gerrothorax (which has an even more highly modified skull than plagiosternines). Life restoration in shallow water The authors who originally described Megalophthalma hypothesized that it and other plagiosaurids had eyes that were much smaller than the orbits. Most reconstructions of plagiosaurids, particularly those of Gerrothorax, show them having flattened eyes that fill up most of the orbits. However, a flattened eye is extremely unlikely because the lens would be too close to the retina to focus an image. Megalophthalma and other plagiosaurids more likely had spherical eyes like those of modern amphibians. The skull of Megalophthalma is too shallow for a spherical eye the width of the orbit to fit within it, so the eye was probably much smaller, perhaps less than in diameter. The eye was probably positioned near the front of the orbit as in modern small-eyed amphibians like cryptobranchid salamanders and pipid frogs. Another possibility, although far less likely, is that Megalophthalma and other plagiosaurids had eyes similar to those of the living deep-sea fish Ipnops, which are reduced to sheet-like retina that cover the upper surface of the skull and are only able to detect movement from shadows. Like Ipnops, plagiosaurids are hypothesized to have rested on the bottom of bodies of water and ambushed prey that swam above them. However, Ipnops and plagiosaurids are very distantly related, making it unlikely that lensless eyes evolved in Megalophthalma.

He is against women having abortions, and believes they should be illegal. In 2015, he co-sponsored, voted for, and helped successfully pass legislation in North Carolina that imposes additional restrictions to a woman's constitutional right to abortion. The new requirements were fully implemented by January 2016, and include: * 72-hour waiting period after first appointment before a woman can have an abortion * A physician must report any abortion or miscarriage after the 16th week of pregnancy to the Department of Health and Human Services, along with the gestational age of the fetus, the measurements of the fetus, and a copy of an ultrasound image. * A physician must report any abortion or miscarriage after the 20th week of pregnancy, and the report must include documentation demonstrating that the procedure was a medical emergency * Physician must be certified in obstetrics or gynecology and possess \\"sufficient training\\" in abortion care * Amended the definition of \\"statutory rape\\" to include intercourse or a sexual act with an individual who is 15 years old or younger * Authorized child support payments to be made by electronic transmission * Established a \\"Maternal Mortality Committee\\" to review maternal deaths and develop recommendations for the prevention of future maternal deaths. = Child Fatality Task Force = Burr has voted to get rid of the Child Fatality Task force, stating he believes that local task forces would be able to continue investigating child deaths. = Environment = In 2014, Burr was given a 0% rating by Environment North Carolina. Burr has voted to repeal a recycling program and to repeal motor vehicle emissions inspections. = Guns = Burr would like to expand the \\"right to carry\\" law in North Carolina. Burr has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association. = LGBT rights = Burr has voted to ban gay marriage in North Carolina. He has voted to allow officials to refuse marriage based on religious objections. He has voted yes on legislation requiring people to use a bathroom that corresponds with their born biological gender. = Penalty on protesters = In 2017, Burr voted to increase punishments for protesters who block roads or damage property. The bill included a requirement for local law enforcement to be given \\"directions to clear the roads\\" immediately whenever a gathering of greater than 10 people block traffic, as opposed to waiting for protesters to disperse peacefully before using force. This bill was in response to nationwide protests. The bill has been criticized for \\"allowing drivers to legally run over protesters who block roads.\\" = Unions = Burr has supported anti-union legislation that would add the state's current \\"right to work\\" law to the constitution. Burr has stated, \\"We do not want, I do not want to see employees, potential employees, have to give up a job because they're forced to contribute or join.\\" At the time, forced unionization was already illegal in North Carolina. The legislation did not further protect against unionization, but made it more difficult to repeal the \\"right to work\\" law in the future. Honors As a teenager, Burr was named the 2003 \\"Outstanding Teen Age Republican in the Nation\\" award, by the National Teen Age Republicans. Five years later, as an adviser to the North Carolina Teen Age Republicans, Burr won the \\"Lillie Murdock Award\\" at the National Teen Age Republicans conference.

She is an inventor of the first disposable cellphone. She began inventing in 1985 and by age 26 became a millionaire. She has granted more than 200 licenses of ideas for games and toys. Early career/toy inventor Altschul's first successes were with toys and games. Her first idea was a 'Miami Vice Game' which built on the success of the American television series of the same name. Other notable toys and games included a Barbie's 30th Birthday Game, and a wearable stuffed toy that could give hugs under the control of the child who was wearing it. She also developed a monster-shaped breakfast cereal which turned soft when covered in milk. Altshul also made money from selling her ideas for board games whose marketing relied on a link with other popular American television series like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Simpsons. Altschul became rich and part of the profits were invested in super-thin technology. Althschul got the idea for the phone when she lost the signal for her conventional mobile phone and resisted the urge to dispose of an expensive phone. She realized that a disposable phone might assist travelers like herself.Randice Altschul , csupomona.edu, retrieved 14 March 2014 Altschul created a new company called Diceland Technologies to exploit these technologies to make the phone she planned. First disposable cell phone In November 1999 Altschul teamed up with Lee Volte. Volte had been the Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Tyco. Altschul and Volte obtained several patents for what would be the world's first disposable mobile phone. Their intellectual property also included the trademark \\"Phone-Card-Phone\\". The new device was a phone that was of a size similar to an existing phone card. The credit card sized device was less than five millimetres thick, and was not made from plastic or metal, but from materials based on recycled paper. The phone incorporated a magnetic strip which meant that credit card companies could store identification which would allow the phone owner to make purchases. The phone was intended to sell at about twenty dollars, and the purchaser would be able to make phone calls totaling up to an hour. The phone was sold as disposable, but it could also be recycled; people who returned their used phones would receive a credit of two to three dollars. Frost & Sullivan, declared the Phone-Card-Phone to be the 2002 Product of the Year.

The episode was written by the series' creator Kevin Williamson and directed by Marcos Siega. Summary The episode starts off immediately from \\"The Final Chapter\\" as Molly stabs Claire again in the chest. Ryan, gaining what strength he can, grabs Molly from behind her hair and strangles her to the ground and breaks her neck, killing her. He manages to get an ambulance to his apartment and he and Claire are rushed to a hospital. After Ryan is out of surgery, he is greeted by Mike and when he questions what happened to Claire, Mike informs him that Claire died, leaving Ryan devastated. A year after the anniversary of the supposed death of Joe Carroll, individuals wearing masks of Carroll's face appear on a New York City Subway car and stab everyone on the train to death, except one woman, who escapes after being stabbed in the arm once. During the attack, they screamed phrases such as \\"Joe Carroll lives\\", \\"Resurrection\\", and \\"Ryan Hardy can't stop us\\". Ryan Hardy, now sober and healthy, and living in New York City and teaching college students, shows up to work and is met by FBI agents. They bring him to the FBI's main office to see if he can be of any help. Agent Phillips shows up at the home of Mike Weston, who was suspended by the Office of Professional Responsibility and is awaiting a hearing. Phillips tells Weston to come to New York to consult on the Subway murders case. Weston is brought to the crime scene where he meets Agent Gina Mendez, the head of the case. Back at the FBI's office, Weston runs into Ryan and has a flashback of a few months ago where the two of them were at a bar with tension between the two as Weston coached Ryan on what to say about why they killed a man the day Agent Debra Parker died. In present day, Ryan, Weston, Mendez, and Phillips question the woman who escaped the subway attacks, Lily Gray, who has no answers on who the attackers were. A young man, Luke, and woman, Heather Clarke, make eye contact in the hallway of a hotel. He brings her to a room and kills her, likely by strangling her as bruises are shown on her neck. He proceeds to play music and dance with Heather's dead body with the majority of her clothing removed. Heather is later found on a park bench, set up in a white dress. Weston and Mendez begin searching for information on possible suspects for the murders and only identify one person, Carlos, who has been missing for over a year. Weston suggests to Ryan that the previous cult has sparked back up and recruited new members, but Hardy seems uninterested and leaves. Back at his house, he enters a passcode-locked room with pictures and files from the case of Carroll's cult pinned all over the walls. Max Hardy, Ryan's niece, arrives at Ryan's house to investigate the situation further with him, as she looks up information on Carlos. They find his address through Max's New York Police Department computer software; Ryan heads to the house despite Max suggestion he instead hand the information over to the FBI and stop the private investigating the two had been up to. Ryan arrives at Carlos' house and attacks him before questioning him at gunpoint. He asks where Joe is, and Carlos says he hasn't seen Joe since the night of his supposed death at the lighthouse; Carlos had picked him up and helped him escape the scene, despite the FBI being fully convinced they'd identified they body they found as Joe's. Carlos manages to escape, but Ryan chases after him and is hit by a car in the street, though he gets up and continues his chase. Carlos runs to another hotel room where a woman, Gisele, answers the door and lets him in. Ryan runs into the hotel, passing by Emma Hill without noticing. Ryan continues to tell Weston he knows nothing and acts like he has no interest in the case. Frustrated, Weston asked Ryan why he had ignored all of his calls and messages in the past year while Weston was struggling with after-thoughts of the case. Ryan fails to provide an answer again and walks off. Ryan later returns to Lily's hospital room to check in with her and apologize for the incident, believing it to be his fault that she was attacked. Back at the hotel, Luke and Mark show up and question Carlos about the subway murders. Carlos assures they have nothing to worry about. Luke proceeds to backhand Carlos' throat. Emma returns to her apartment where she lives with Hannah and other former Carroll cult members who were never found by the FBI. A young girl, Mandy Lang, screams to a man named \\"Daryl\\" to come look at the news report on television about the subway murders. \\"Daryl\\" walks into the house, revealed to be Joe Carroll.

In his review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther called the film \\"a typical artificial romance on the heart-rending theme of Camille\\". Plot Not knowing her illness is terminal, concert pianist Karen Duncan checks into a Switzerland sanatorium under the care of Dr. Tony Stanton, whose stern manner Karen does not like. One day she and another patient, Celestine Miller, enjoy a day away from the clinic and a night on the town, despite their doctor's advice. Auto racer Paul Clermont is introduced to Karen and invites her to Monte Carlo. Although she is attracted to her doctor, Tony's seeming lack of interest in anything but her health causes Karen to accept Paul's invitation. She gambles, smokes and drinks, then returns to the sanatorium to discover that Celestine has died. Panic-stricken, Karen's first impulse is to follow her doctor's orders to refrain from exerting herself. She disobeys, going away with Paul again and endangering her well-being. Only at the last possible minute does she return to Tony's side, where he proposes marriage to her and watches carefully as their future together hangs by a thread.

She published books on women's sexuality and health among other topics. Her last known public appearance was in 1930 in Vienna, where she gave a talk at a conference organised by the World League for Sexual Reform. She was open about her own homosexuality which made her a somewhat exceptional figure in the feminist movement of her time. Her career as an activist was ended in 1933, when the Nazi Party rose to power. There is no public record of a funeral but witnesses report that Elberskirchen's urn was secretly put into the grave of Hildegard Moniac, who had been her life partner. Quotes Based on the assumption that women's libido only exists in order to secure the creation of offspring and is therefore fundamentally different from men's libido, Elberskirchen argued that: \\"If it was the yearning for a child, there would be no abortion, no infanticide, no suicide. In that case the awful punitive articles wouldn't exist. And first and foremost the outrageous, immoral contempt of an unmarried mother and her child wouldn't exist - there would be no 'fallen' women, no 'bastards'.Die Sexualempfindung bei Weib und Mann. 1903, S. 26.

Oil production was a minor factor in the 19th century, with kerosene replacing whale oil and lubricants becoming essential to the machine age. Oil became a major California industry in the 20th century with the discovery on new fields around Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley, and the dramatic increase in demand for gasoline to fuel automobiles and trucks. In 1900 California pumped , nearly 5% of the national supply. Then came a series of major discoveries, and the state pumped in 1914, or 38% of the national supply.Harold F. Williamson et al. The American Petroleum Industry the Age of Energy 1899-1959 (1963) p 17 In 2012 California produced of crude oil, out of the total of oil produced in the U.S, representing 8.3% of national production.US Energy Information Administration, Crude oil production, accessed 10 Mar 2014 California drilling operations and oil production are concentrated primarily in Kern County, San Joaquin Valley and the Los Angeles basin. There is also some offshore oil and gas production in California, but there is now a permanent moratorium on new offshore oil and gas leasing and new offshore platforms in both California and federal waters, although new wells can be drilled from existing platforms. These restrictions were imposed after the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill released oil into the Pacific Ocean.1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill accessed 12 Jan 2014 California produces some gas but imports most of its supply by pipeline. Early history There was plenty of visible oil in California and eastern experts said it would be worth a fortune. The early oil ventures in the 1850s and 1860s were well- funded, but all of them failed. The drillers spent $1 million and their poor quality oil was worth only $10,000.Richard Rice et al. The Elusive Eden: A New History of California (1988) p 317 Prospectors after 1848 discovered an increasing number of oil seeps‚Äîoil seeping to the surface. In Northern California, there were oil seeps in Humboldt, Colusa, Santa Clara, and San Mateo Counties, and in the asphaltum seeps and bituminous residues in Mendocino, Marin, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties. In Southern California, large seeps were found in Ventura, Santa Barbara, Kern, and Los Angeles Counties.Early California oil discoveries accessed 11 Jan 2014 Interest in oil and gas seeps was stirred in the 1850s and 1860s, Interest became widespread after the 1859 commercial discovery of oil in Pennsylvania. In 1864, Yale chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman, Jr., a leading expert, examined the oil seepages in Ventura County, and wrote reports that indicated excellent commercial possibilities. This led to the Leland Stanford, and his brother Josiah, digging oil tunnels into the south side of Sulphur Mountain, while Thomas A. Scott and Thomas Bard drilled into the north side. The Philadelphia & California Petroleum Company, drilled wells in the Ojai region between 1865 and 1867; one became California‚Äôs first \\"gusher.\\" As early as 1856 a company began working the tar pits at La Brea Ranch, near Los Angeles, distilling some oil. Initially these oil discoveries were done by hand digging a well with pick and shovel or even tunneling (by hand) into a mountain that contained oil. By sloping the tunnels downward the oil ran out the mouth to be collected. Some of this oil was so thick that when pipelines were used they had to be heated in winter to get the oil to flow. Transporting the oil to a market or refinery was nearly always a primary concern. In 1866 the first oil refinery in California was built near McKittrick Tar Pits in Kern County to process kerosene and asphalt. Much of California‚Äôs early oil discoveries were in the form of asphalt also known as bitumen a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. It was found in natural deposits and by processing it became a refined product. Some cities in California started asphalting their streets in the 1870s to keep down dust and mud. In the 20th century the primary use is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles or gravel to create asphalt concrete. Oil production The Los Angeles City Oil Field. Other oil fields are shown in light gray. The story of oil production in California began in the late 19th century.\\"Oil and Gas Production: History in California.\\" State of California. Web. 18 Mar. 2013. . As of 2012, California was the nation's third most prolific oil-producing state, behind only Texas and North Dakota. In the 20th century, California‚Äôs oil industry grew to become the state‚Äôs number one GDP export and one of the most profitable industries in the region.E. Hugenin, History of gas conservation in California (1945) Standard Oil largely controlled the distribution of oil products in the state. After its breakup by the Supreme Court in 1911, its California operations became Standard Oil of California or \\"California Standard.\\" It is now part of Chevron Corporation. The Los Angeles City Oil Field was discovered in 1890, and made famous by Edward L. Doheny's successful well in 1892. The field became the top producing oil field in California, accounting for more than half of the state's oil in 1895. Doheny became one of the richest men in California. The peak year was 1901, with 200 separate oil companies active on the field. In 2011 only one small well remained in production. In 1900, the state produced 4 million barrels. In 1903, California became the leading oil- producing state in the US, and traded the number one position back-and forth with Oklahoma through the year 1930.G. R. Hopkins and A. B. Coons, 1934, \\"Crude petroleum and petroleum products,\\" in: Statistical Appendix to Minerals Yearbook 1932-33, US Bureau of Mines, p.306-307. Production at the various oil fields increased to about 34 million barrels by 1904. By 1910 production has reached 78 million barrels. By 1920, oil production in California had expanded to 77 million barrels. Between 1920 and 1930, new oil fields across Southern California were being discovered with regularity including Huntington Beach in 1920, Long Beach and Santa Fe Springs in 1921, and Dominguez in 1923. Southern California had become the hotbed for oil production in the United States. A 1926 Times magazine article stated that the Standard Oil Company of California (now Chevron) was then the largest individual producer of crude oil in the U.S. and dominated the marketing of petroleum products along the west coast of both Americas.\\"ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/pub/oil/history/History_of_Calif.pdf . Oil and Gas Production: History in California In 1929, however, the sense of crisis in the oil market grew as vast amounts of oil supplies were going unused in Southern California and throughout the US. The situation got worse during the Great Depression, with oil selling for 25 cents a barrel. The solution came in the mid-1930s when the Railroad Commission of Texas gained permission of Washington and the major oil companies to set the national price of oil. =San Joaquin Valley Oil= Except for a couple of mediocre wells on the \\"westside\\" of the San Joaquin Valley, and a few tar mining operations, farming was the mainstay of the valley in the late 1800s. However, the 1899 discovery of \\"black gold\\" in a shallow hand-dug oil well on the west bank of the Kern River changed all that. The Kern River discovery started an oil boom, and a forest of wooden derricks sprang up overnight on the flood plain just north of Bakersfield, a sleepy farm town known to most as \\"Bakers Swamp\\". Soon Kern River production accounted for 7 out of every 10 barrels of oil that came from California, and the Kern River field by 1903 had made California the top oil-producing state in the country. Inspired by the Kern River discovery, oil prospectors fanned out across the San Joaquin Valley, and derricks began to pop up everywhere. Many discoveries followed, and a string of spectacular gushers at Coalinga, McKittrick and Midway-Sunset fields kept the valley in the oil news. The Valley is also home to 21 giant oil fields which have produced over 100 million barrels of oil each, with four \\"super giants\\" that have produced over 1 billion barrels of oil. Among these \\"super giants\\" are Midway-Sunset (the largest oil field in the lower 48 United States), and Elk Hills (former U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserve). =Refining and distribution= Five companies controlled most of the refining and distribution of oil in California in the early twentieth century. The leader was California Standard (Chevron Corporation), a separate company since the court-ordered breakup of the Standard Oil trust in 1911. Second was the Union Oil Company, formed in 1890, and based in Ventura County. The Shell Company of California was the only affiliate of an outside Corporation. The Associated Oil Company was fourth, and was controlled by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company. The newest company was General Petroleum Company, organized in 1910, which operated in the San Joaquin and southern fields. Union Oil Company of California, (\\"Unocal\\") was bought out by Chevron in 2005 after a Chinese attempt to buy the company failed,Arthur M. Johnson, \\"California and the National Oil Industry,\\" Pacific Historical Review (1970) 39#2 pp. 155-169 at p 159 =California shale oil (tight oil) production= Widely distributed in sedimentary basins of southern California is the Monterey shale, thought by some to contain more than 400 billion barrels of oil in place. The formation has for many years yielded oil in areas where it is naturally fractured, and oil companies are investigating ways to make the shale in currently non- productive areas give up the oil through artificial fracturing.California shale oil production accessed 12 Jan 2013 Over some large areas, California's geologic layers are complexly folded, making horizontal drilling difficult. As of 2013, the Monterey shale has resisted attempts to obtain economic production of oil through hydraulic fracturing, fracking, which involves injecting water, sand, and chemicals into the shale under high pressure, to crack the rock and allow the oil and gas to flow. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates there are over 15 billion barrels of oil that can be recovered using today's technology and potentially much more if techniques can be found to safely release it. Despite intense industry efforts, there has been little success to date (2013) in producing Monterey-hosted tight oil/shale oil, and it may be many years, if ever, before the Monterey becomes a significant producer of shale oil.So Much Shale Oil‚Äîbut So Hard to Get, Wall Street Journal, Updated Sept. 23, 2013 Chronology of the California oil industry *1864 - Tar mined from open pits at Asphalto (McKittrick) on west side of San Joaquin Valley. *1866 - First refinery in Kern County built near McKittrick tar pits to process kerosene and asphalt. *1866 - Oil is collected from tunnels dug at Sulphur Mountain in Ventura County by the brothers of railroad baron Leland Stanford *1866 - First steam-powered rig in California drills an oil well at Ojai, near the Sulphur Mountain seeps. *1875 - First commercial oil field in California is discovered at Pico Canyon in Los Angeles County. *1878 - First wooden derrick in Kern County constructed at Reward to drill for flux oil to mix with asphalt. *1885 - Gas wells are drilled in Stockton, California for fuel and lighting. *1885 - Oil burners used on steam engines in the California oil fields, and later used on ships and locomotives, create new oil markets. *1886 Gasoline-powered automobiles introduced in Europe. *1887 - \\"Wild Goose\\" well at Oil City, Coalinga comes in at 10 bbls/day, demonstrating potential of north part of basin. *1888 A steel-hulled tanker sails from Ventura to San Francisco. *1889 - Oil wells drilled at Old Sunset (Maricopa) with a steam-powered rig mark discovery of Midway-Sunset field. * 1890 - Merger of three companies to found The Union Oil Company of California in Santa Paula, California, by Lyman Stewart, Thomas Bard, and Wallace Hardison. * 1890 - Los Angeles City Oil Field is discovered * 1892 - Edward L.

Only a relatively small fraction was used for lighting or heating purposes. At the turn of the century, before electrical lights were common, street lighting in cities was done by gas street lamps. Some homes were lighted with gas lamps. Much of this gas was generated from coal. By the time significant amounts of natural gas became available electricity was taking over the lighting job. The gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the American Southwest beginning in 1918. The natural gas found was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce.Charles M. Coleman, P.G. and E. of California: the centennial story of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, 1852-1952 (1952) p=299 While natural gas sources were abundant in Southern California, no economical sources were then available in Northern California. In 1929, PG&E; constructed a 300-mile pipeline from the Kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to San Francisco Bay area. The city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured coal gas to natural gas. The transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on 1.75 million appliances and gas lamps. In 1936, PG&E; expanded distribution with an additional 45-mile pipeline from Milpitas. PG&E; gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities, although some plants were kept on standby. During World War II defense related population growth and industry growth boosted natural gas sales in California and cut deeply into the state's natural reserves. In 1947, PG&E; entered into a contract with the Southern California Gas Company and the Southern Counties Gas Company to purchase natural gas through a new 1,000-mile pipeline running from Texas and New Mexico to Los Angeles. Another agreement was reached with the El Paso Natural Gas Company of Texas for gas delivery to the California-Arizona border. In 1951, PG&E; completed a 502-mile gas main which connected with the El Paso network at the state line. In 2012 California was the 13th largest state in terms of natural gas production, with a total annual production of 248 billion cu feet of gas.California gas production accessed 12 Jan 2014 Today natural gas is the second most widely used energy source in California. Depending on yearly weather conditions, about 45% of the total natural gas used is now burned in natural gas fired electric generator plants for electricity generation as coal burning plants are phased out. Most of these plants are cogeneration plants that use high temperature burning gas to run gas turbines driven generators and use the captured turbine exhaust heat as power for a steam turbine driven generator set. By combining these technologies almost 60% of the energy from burning gas can be converted from heat into electrical power. About 9% of the natural gas is used in facilitating the extraction of more oil and gas. Roughly 21% is used for residential space and water heating, cooking, clothes drying, etc.; about 8.6% is used for commercial building and water heating, 14.5% is used in industrial use and some of the rest has varied uses such as fueling bus fleets and UPS trucks.California Uses for Natural Gas accessed 12 Jan 2014 California imports about 85% of its natural gas using six large gas lines. The majority of its natural gas comes from the American Southwest, the Rocky Mountain states, and Canada. The remaining 15% of California's natural gas is produced in-state, both off-shore and onshore. Natural gas-fired electricity generator plants have been the dominant use of natural gas California for many years. Natural gas is a dispatchable resource that fills in the gaps from other electrical resources when peak power loads are needed. In addition, natural gas releases from a natural gas fired generator station are about half the CO2 that coal fired plants would use.CO2 release from fossil fuel power production Accessed 7 Mar 2014 Typically California gets about 14% of its electricity from water generated electricity. The availability of hydroelectricity resources depends upon annual rainfall in the state so varies considerably year by year. The emergence of renewable and often highly variable resources for electricity generation such as solar and wind power has led to more natural gas use in generation with its much cheaper, more versatile and reliable source of electricity generation‚Äîso far. Natural gas prices spiked in 2007 but have decreased significantly since then as more gas has become available nationwide. The biggest change in U.S. gas supply has been the expansion of total natural gas production in the Lower 48 States, which has increased 20% from 2005 to 2011. The increase is largely attributed to breakthroughs in horizontal drilling techniques and increased hydraulic fracturing. Six major interstate pipelines deliver the 85% of natural gas imported to California. Inside California more than 100,000 miles of intrastate pipelines take the natural gas to customers for immediate consumption or to underground storage facilities for later use.CPUC, California Natural Gas Supply Infrastructure accessed 12 Jan 2014 There are 10 operating natural gas storage facilities in California, which use underground depleted oil or natural gas production fields. All but three of them are owned by either Pacific Gas and Electric or Southern California Gas Company. The latest interstate pipeline additions are the 42 inch diameter Ruby Pipeline, LLC, which began operation in California near the Oregon border in July 2011,Ruby Pipeline Interconnect accessed 12 Jan 2014 and the Kern River Expansion, which came on-line in October 2011. In literature and film The early California oil industry has served as a setting for several notable fictional novels and films: * Oil! (1927), a novel of social criticism by Upton Sinclair is set against the background of the California oil industry and is loosely based on the career of Edward Doheny and events related to the Teapot Dome scandal. * There Will Be Blood (2007), a film loosely based on Oil!, as well as original research on Doheny and the early California oil industry.Kern‚Äôs past helped fuel new film by Shellie Branco, Bakersfield Californian, 11 January, 2008. * Burning Gold (1936 film) * Boom Town (1940), a film about wildcatting in the mid-20th Century oil industry, including in the California oil fields. Much of the film was shot on location in California oil towns such as Taft and Bakersfield. Notes Further reading * Adamson, Michael R. \\"The Role of the Independent: Ralph B.

It was published from 1849 to 1853 by Amelia Jenks Bloomer (1818‚Äì1894), before she sold the newspaper to Mary Birdsall in 1854. While the newspaper initially focused on temperance, it soon broadened its focus to include the many issues of women‚Äôs rights activists in the 1850s. It grew in its distribution as a result of its discussion of bloomers, a comfortable fashion popularized by Bloomer in the paper. Early years of publication First issue of The Lily, January 1, 1849. In 1848, The Lily developed as a publication for \\"home distribution\\" among the women who belonged to the Seneca Falls Ladies Temperance Society in response to their feeling marginalized by the larger temperance movement. Enthusiasm for the project quickly faded, however. Amelia Bloomer didn't want to see the paper die, and so she took on responsibility for editing and publishing the paper. Bloomer's initial interest was not in women's rights but in temperance, and this topic featured prominently in its early issues, even after the paper detached from the Temperance Society. Bloomer believed that women writing in pursuit of reform was less unseemly than giving speeches or lectures. The first issues were priced at 50 cents a year and published in Seneca Falls, New York as a monthly, eight-page, three- column publication. The inaugural issue, published on January 1, 1849, set forth the philosophy and initial goals: \\"It is WOMAN that speaks through the LILY. It is upon an important subject, too, that she comes before the public to be heard. Intemperance is the great foe to her peace and happiness.\\" Bloomer wrote, \\"The Lily was the first paper devoted to the interests of woman and, so far as I know, the first one owned, edited and published by a woman.\\" Initially, the title page celebrated this by announcing that it was \\"Published by a committee of ladies,\\" but after 1850, the masthead featured Bloomer's name alone. Far from radical, the initial publication focused on issues of temperance, showing women as \\"defenders of the home.\\" In the first issue, Bloomer wrote: > It is woman that speaks through The Lily‚Ä¶Intemperance is the great foe to > her peace and happiness. It is that above all that has made her Home > desolate and beggared her offspring‚Ä¶. Surely, she has the right to wield her > pen for its Suppression. Surely, she may without throwing aside the modest > refinements which so much become her sex, use her influence to lead her > fellow mortals from the destroyer‚Äôs path.  Developing focus on women's rights  As the newspaper evolved, its focus shifted to include broader issues of women's rights. This expansion of focus was partly through the influence of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a contributor to The Lily, who wrote under the pseudonym \\"sunflower.\\" By 1850 the Lily described itself as \\"DEVOTED TO THE INTERESTS OF WOMEN,\\" and by 1852, it described itself as dedicated to \\"Emancipation of Woman from Intemperance, Injustice, Prejudice, and Bigotry.\\" Bloomer involved many editors and contributors who helped one another with the publication process, and this became a model for later periodicals focused on women's suffrage. Other early periodicals edited by women that focused on women's issues and protests include The Genius of Liberty (1851‚Äì1853), edited by Elizabeth Aldrich; The Pioneer and Woman's Advocate (1852‚Äì1853), edited by Ann W. Spencer; The Una (1853‚Äì1855), edited by Paula Wright Davis; The Revolution (1868‚Äì1872), edited by Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Parker Pillsbury; The Woman's Advocate, (1855‚Äì1858), and The Sibyl (1856‚Äì1864), edited by Lydia Hasbrouck. One source describes the range of contents within The Lily, \\"An intriguing mix of contents ranging from recipes to moralist tracts, The Lily captivated readers from a broad spectrum of women and slowly educated them not only about the truth of women‚Äôs inequities but in the possibilities of major social reform.\\" Throughout its publication, the newspaper contained reminders about the importance of temperance and the horrors of alcohol. For example, a May 1849 issue contained the following example: ‚ÄúA man when drunk fell into a kettle of boiling brine at Liverpool, Onondaga Co. and was scaled to death.‚Äù Depiction of Amelia Bloomer wearing the famous \\"bloomer\\" costume which was named after her (a tunic + \\"pantelettes\\"). \\"The Bloomer Costume\\", that Bloomer became known for, an outfit consisting of a tunic and pantelettes, was also visible in the paper. While Bloomer didn't create this outfit, she defended it in The Lily, and these articles were later picked up by The New York Tribune. Bloomer's articles about this style of dress, along with illustrations, sewing instructions, and tales of women who embraced bloomers that were printed in The Lily, led the style to become viewed as Bloomer's creation. She explained that this clothing style was essential to the health and safety of women, by reducing risks from carrying children and candles up stairs. She recalled, ‚ÄúAs soon as it became known that I was wearing the new dress, letters came pouring in upon me by the hundreds from women all over the country making inquiries about the dress and asking for patterns ‚Äì showing how ready and anxious women were to throw off the burden of long, heavy skirts.‚Äù While Bloomer and others eventually discarded this outfit because it shifted people's focus from women's right to clothing, The Lily played a key role in publicizing this outfit that would help change norms of women's dress in the U.S. The Lily rose from a circulation of 500 a month to 4000 a month, with some of the increase because of its discussion of women's bloomers and dress reform. Reflecting back, Bloomer described her feelings about being the first woman to run a newspaper for women, ‚ÄúIt was a needed instrument to spread abroad the truth of a new gospel to woman, and I could not withhold my hand to stay the work I had begun. I saw not the end from the beginning and dreamed where to my propositions to society would lead me.‚Äù The newspaper modeled how a newspaper could inspire a sense of community and continuity among suffrage leaders, one source describes. Later years of publication Increasingly in the early 1850s, the relationship of the temperance movement and the women's struggle for suffrage became more pronounced in The Lily. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a contributor, demanded in an article that women be included in the making of laws to restrict liquor sales and to divorce intemperate men. Bloomer wrote that \\"the only way in which women can do anything effectually in this [temperance] cause is through the ballot-box,\\" a position she called \\"a strong women's rights sentiment.\\" The Lily published articles not only on women's suffrage but also on major social reform issues such as property rights, education, employment, dress reform, and slavery, including women's slavery to men. Increasingly the newspaper saw solutions to the dangers of drunken husbands to lie in greater rights for women and larger structural changes. One source recounts an 1853 mission statement printed in the paper explained that The Lily would \\"labour for the emancipation of women not only from 'unjust laws' but also 'from the destructive influences of Custom and Fashion.'\\" In a biography of Amelia Bloomer written by her husband, she is quoted as declaring that she never liked the \\"pretty\\" name of the paper (appointed by the local women's temperance society) but since the newspaper soon became known far and wide by that name, she decided not to change it. By 1853, the paper had a national circulation of 6000, and Bloomer continued producing it from Mount Vernon, Ohio, after Bloomer moved with her husband Dexter Bloomer. In 1854 or 1855, Amelia Bloomer sold the paper to Mary Birdsall because she was moving again a new house in Council Bluffs, Iowa, which lacked facilities for newspaper publication. Bloomer continued as a corresponding editor. Birdsall had been an editor of the Indiana Farmer, including its section on women. She was a supporter of Bloomer's views and the newspaper provided a vehicle for her to continue her journalism. The newspaper continued to campaign for women's issues and temperance. Under Birdsall, the paper was published in Richmond, Indiana, for some years and was distributed nationally. Dr. Mary F. Thomas helped Birdsall edit and publish the paper.

The killer became known in the media as the ‚ÄúSan Mateo Slasher.\\" It was later proven that there were at least two different perpetrators. Killings On January 8, 1976 the body of 18-year-old Veronica Cascio was discovered in a creek on the grounds of the Sharp Park Golf Course in Pacifica. She had been stabbed 30 times. A transient was arrested but was released for lack of evidence. A few weeks later, 14-year-old Tatiana Blackwell was reported missing after leaving her home in Pacifica to run an errand. A body, later identified as hers, was discovered off Sharp Park Road in the Gypsy Hills section of the city on June 6. She had also been stabbed multiple times. Paula Baxter, 17 years old, went missing on February 2, leaving her mired car behind. Her nude body was found on February 4 in Millbrae behind the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Ludeman Lane. She had been stabbed 4 times, sexually assaulted, and hit on the head with a piece of concrete. Her killing was forensically linked to Cascio's. On April 1, 19-year-old Denise Lampe of Broadmoor was found dead after a search in the parking lot of the Serramonte Center. She had been stabbed 20 times. Carol Booth, 26, was reported missing by her husband on March 15, and was discovered in a shallow grave near Colma Creek on Grand Avenue in South San Francisco on May 6. Victims The five victims were: *Veronica \\"Ronnie\\" Cascio *Tatiana Marie \\"Tanya\\" Blackwell *Paula Louise Baxter *Carol Lee Booth *Denise Lampe Possible victims ;Michelle Mitchell Mitchell, 19, was last seen alive in Reno, Nevada on February 24, 1976 when her Volkswagen Beetle broke down at the intersection of 9th Street and Evans Avenue. Witnesses reported seeing someone help push her vehicle into the parking lot across from the UNR agricultural building on Evans Street. Her body was discovered that evening in a garage on East 9th Street with her hands bound and her throat slashed. Three years later, Cathy Woods, a mental patient at the Louisiana State University Medical Center, confessed to having murdered a woman named Michelle. Woods was charged and convicted of murdering Michelle Mitchell. 35 years later she was released from prison in 2015 after DNA evidence cleared her. ;Idell M. Friedman Friedman, 21, an employee of an import firm, was found assaulted and stabbed to death with an 8-inch-knife in her apartment at 116 Fairmount Street in San Francisco. She was murdered on March 17, 1976, only two days after Gypsy Hill victim Carol Lee Booth was reported missing. Friedman's nude body was lying on the kitchen floor of her ransacked apartment. She was found by a co-worker who became concerned when Friedman did not show up for work. Investigation and arrests Investigators have connected some of the homicides to each other. All the slain women were young brunettes and most had experienced car trouble prior to being murdered. All the bodies were found in wooded areas. A lack of witnesses and forensic evidence stalled the investigations. In March 2014, the FBI established a task force to re-examine the murders, after new DNA evidence cast doubt on the conviction of Cathy Woods, now 64, for Mitchell's murder. The DNA taken from a cigarette butt found at the Mitchell crime scene matched DNA taken from semen found at related crime scenes in San Mateo, California. This DNA was that of a man and therefore might exonerate Woods. On September 8, 2014, the FBI named Rodney Halbower as a person of interest in the Gypsy Hill murders. Woods was released from prison on September 11 pending a new trial to take place on July 13, 2015. In March 2015, prosecutors dismissed the charges against Woods. On January 22, 2015, Halbower was charged with two of the murders (Paula Baxter and Veronica Cascio). DNA evidence linked him to both. On November 8, 2017, Leon Melvin Seymour was charged with the murder of Denise Lampe, based on DNA evidence. On September 18, 2018, Halbower was convicted of the murders of Cascio and Baxter. Finally, on October 10, 2018, Halbower was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for the murders of Cascio and Baxter. Cathy Woods, 68, is the longest-ever wrongfully imprisoned woman in US history, records show. She was released from prison in 2015 when fresh evidence linked the 1976 murder of Reno college student Michelle Mitchell to suspected serial killer Rodney Halbower. Halbower will most likely face a trial in Nevada for the murder of Michelle Mitchell in the near future. The murders of Tanya Blackwell and Carol Lee Booth are both believed to have been committed by Rodney Halbower, but there was not enough evidence to charge him for their deaths.

Henry Arthur McArdle (June 9, 1836 ‚Äì February 16, 1908) was an American painter of French and Irish ancestry. He was born in Belfast, Ireland on June 9, 1836, and immigrated as a teenager to the U.S. state of Maryland, where he studied at the Maryland Institute College of Art. During the American Civil War he was a cartographer in the service of Robert E. Lee. After the war he took a job at Baylor University and Baylor Female College and moved to Independence, Texas, where he was also known as Harry McArdle, with his new wife Jennie Smith. After moving to Texas he interviewed members of Hood's Texas Brigade who fought with Robert E. Lee at the Battle of the Wilderness, as research for his painting titled Lee at the Wilderness. In 1890, Texas governor Lawrence Sullivan Ross commissioned him for a painting of Jefferson Davis to hang in the capitol building. McArdle moved to San Antonio and continued to paint many scenes of Texas history. He is best known for his 1895 painting The Battle of San Jacinto, which depicts Sam Houston, and Dawn at the Alamo, depicting the final battle and first completed in 1875. The original painting hung in the Texas State Capitol building but was lost when a fire destroyed the building in 1881. He completed another version of the painting in 1905, which features Davy Crockett, James Bowie and William B. Travis. Both of the paintings were purchased from the family by the State of Texas after his death, and now hang in the Senate chamber of the Texas State Capitol. Widowed in 1871, he married Isophene Lacy Dunnington. They had five children together. She died on June 18, 1907 and he died on February 16, 1908. They are buried together in City Cemetery #6 in San Antonio. In January 2015, a collection of McArdle's journals, correspondence, painting aids and other materials was placed online by Baylor University's Digital Projects Group and The Texas Collection. The materials, which were drawn from Baylor University's holdings and McArdle's descendants, are available for research via the Baylor University Libraries Digital Collections.

Bush. The review led to a series of memoranda that, as of March 2014, remained classified. According to The New York Times, the memoranda \\"cast a particularly harsh light\\" on the Bush-era interrogation program, and people who have read them have said parts of the memos are \\"particularly scorching\\" of techniques such as waterboarding, which the memos describe as providing little valuable intelligence. The existence of the review was revealed by Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO) during a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee on December 17, 2013. Udall said that the Panetta Review conflicted with the CIA's official response. Furthermore, Udall stated that the Panetta Review was consistent with \\"The Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program\\", a highly critical report generated by the Intelligence Committee. A 525-page summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report was made public on December 9, 2014.  Senate‚ÄìCIA hacking dispute  In January 2014, CIA officials claimed that the Intelligence Committee had accessed review documents and removed them from CIA facilities in 2010 without CIA authorization. On March 11, 2014, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, confirmed that copies of portions of the review had been removed and transferred to a safe in the Senate's Hart Office Building. She argued that the action was necessary to protect the documents from the CIA, which had destroyed videotapes depicting brutal interrogation methods in 2005. During an \\"extraordinary\\" 45-minute speech on March 11, 2014, Feinstein said the CIA unlawfully searched the Intelligence Committee's computers to determine how the committee staff obtained the review documents. Feinstein also said that the CIA's acting general counsel, later identified as Robert Eatinger, requested the FBI conduct a criminal inquiry into the committee staff's behavior. She said she believed that the request was \\"a potential effort to intimidate [Intelligence Committee] staff.\\" Eatinger had been one of two lawyers who approved the destruction of video tapes in 2005, and Feinstein added that Eatinger was mentioned by name over 1,600 times in the Committee‚Äôs report. She promised to push for declassifying the committee report, which she said would reveal \\"the horrible details of the CIA program.\\" In response to Feinstein's speech, global surveillance leaker Edward Snowden said that it was \\"clear\\" the CIA was trying to play \\"keep away\\" with the Panetta Review, and he also compared Feinstein to German chancellor Angela Merkel for what he saw as hypocrisy for complaining about the CIA allegedly spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee while supporting mass surveillance programs by the National Security Administration. In July 2014, a Justice Department spokesman confirmed that they would not be pursuing charges in the hacking incident. On July 31, 2014, the CIA confirmed that it had improperly gained access to the Senate Intelligence Committee's computer network. CIA director John O. Brennan had previously denied this, adding, \\"When the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong.\\" See also * 2005 CIA interrogation tapes destruction * Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture * Torture memos * Torture in the United States References Category:Classified information in the United States Category:Central Intelligence Agency Category:Torture in the United States Category:United States government secrecy ","title":"Panetta Review"},{"id":"42150652","text":"Christina Corrie, 1903 The Queensland Women's Electoral League (QWEL) was an organisation founded in 1903 in Brisbane to advance the cause of women's suffrage in Queensland, Australia.

As the plot develops, it is revealed that they want the ranch so they can sell it to a company that wants to run an oil pipeline through a mountain pass at the edge of the property. Roy comes to the town of Padre Wells, leaving his guns at his squatter's camp on the Ladder-A ranch. He gets into a fistfight with Rusty Channing, a cowboy from the Bridle-Bit ranch who is harassing a gypsy girl and her boyfriend. After defeating Channing, Bridle-Bit owner J. Richard Bentley advises Roy to bring his guns the next time he shows up. Roy returns to the Ladder-A, where he forms a relationship with the owner's daughter Lorrie Alastair, and moves into the bunkhouse. Lorrie's father has been shot in the arm by the bad guys who are after his ranch. A range war ensues, with Roy, the Ladder-A group and the gypsies on one side, and the Bridle-Bit gang and bad guys from the Santa Fe Oil Company on the other. The gypsy girl briefly has a crush on Roy, but his heart belongs to Lorrie. Ultimately there is a showdown at the Bridle-Bit, with the bad guys having the upper hand until the gypsies race in and save the day. Roy and Lorrie openly fall in love and live happily ever after.

Barnum's circus and performed at the famed Folies Berg√®re in Paris. French sources identify her as Emilie Poupon (1861‚Äì?) of Nantey, Jura Department, France. Promotional posters of Nala Damajanti have been widely reproduced and are thought to have inspired one of the popular folk images of the African water spirit Mami Wata. Similar acts performing under slightly variant names such as Mala Damajaute, Nata Damajaute, and Nala Damajante are thought to have been the same person. Promotional poster for the appearance of snake charmer Nala Damajanti at the Folies Berg√®re, probably from 1886.  Origins  A 17 March 1887 French-language article in Le Gaulois revealed that Nala Damajanti was born Emilie Poupon in Nantey, France on 4 July 1861. In 1881 she was working as a governess with a French family in St. Petersburg, Russia, when she fell in love with and later married a ceiling-walking acrobat by the name of Palmer who introduced her to the art of snake charming. A record of her marriage to John Palmer in Walworth, Surrey, England on 20 Apr 1886 gives her full name as Mathilde Marie Amelia Poupon, aged 24, and her father's name as Xavier Poupon.\\"England Marriages, 1538‚Äì1973 ,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NJSJ-99W : 10 February 2018), John Palmer and Mathilde Marie Amelia Poupon, 20 Apr 1886; citing St. John, Walworth, Surrey, England, reference P 89, 177, index based upon data collected by the Genealogical Society of Utah, Salt Lake City; FHL microfilm 291,747. After developing her skills, she toured in America and joined Barnum's famous circus troupe in 1885. She then returned to Paris to perform at the Folies Berg√®re (debuting on 18 February 1887). The revelation of Nala Damajanti's given name was prompted by a lawsuit, in which the plaintiff had confused her with another person. As Poupon was scheduled to depart for Hamburg in the near future, with her eight enormous boas, she allowed her true identity to be revealed to have the case resolved as soon as possible. Most Nala Damajanti posters claim that she was a Hindu, and the name is apparently a combination of the names of husband-and-wife characters from the Indian epic the Mahabharata, Nala and Damajanti. Henry Drewal indicated that in Hamburg, Germany, a professional animal dealer named BreitwieserProbably Heinrich Breitwieser (ca. 1864-?), who is listed on a 5 Nov 1901 Hamburg passenger list as a \\"Tierh√§ndler\\" bound for Yokohama, see Staatsarchiv Hamburg. Hamburg Passenger Lists, 1850-1934 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2008. who often worked as a specialist snake procurer with the Tierpark Hagenbeck, a famous zoo in Hamburg, returned from a supposed trip to Asia with a new wife who performed as a snake charmer under the name of Maladamajaute, starting around 1880. Drewal supposed that she might have come from Samoa or Borneo. Lademann-Priemer goes to some lengths to demonstrate the possibility of this idea. Lorenz Hagenbeck, son of Carl Hagenbeck, the zoo's founder, recalled in his autobiography that Breitwieser's wife had \\"done stage business with snakes\\" and that Breitwieser had been a showman at one time. (note Breitwieser spelled as \\"Breitweiser\\") Carl Hagenbeck fondly recalled her in a section of his 1909 autobiography Von Tieren und Menschen, though in the 1912 abridged English translation, that portion was omitted. Hagenbeck refers to her as a \\"Proven√ßalin\\" (a native of Provence). He further relates that she married an (unnamed) circus ceiling-walker, and they developed an innovative snake taming technique that allowed them to create an extremely successful act that toured America under the name Nala Damajante to much acclaim. Hagenbeck remarks that she was his best snake customer for some time and describes her as having an extraordinarily graceful figure, with large, attractive dark eyes, and long unusually dark hair. On 4 October 1884, \\"Nala Damajanta\\" published a notice in the New York Clipper that she had severed her relationship with her manager John Palmer. On 11 October, John Palmer (son of prominent ceiling-walker James Palmer) published a notice in the same publication that \\"Nala Damajanta (so called) whom I had engaged for the last three years\\" had severed their business relationship unilaterally. He asserted his rights to the name under that and other spellings and stated that he had engaged another performer from Europe to come to America and continue the act. In 1894, Palmer was still managing the act and was referred to as \\"husband of Nala Damajanti\\" in his 1896 obituary. In a humorous anecdote recounted in Puck,Puck, (v. XV (381), p. 284, 1884) while traveling with the Forepaugh circus, Nala Damajante was reported to have stated that she was from Connecticut. However, in a 9 January 1884 interview for the Daily Alta California, she claimed to be 24 years old and born in the \\"French settlements of Judea.\\" The reporter noted that her command of English seemed to be \\"so poor that no attempt is made here to reproduce her queer pronunciation and phraseology.\\" In an 1894 interview for the London weekly To-Day, during a run at the Palace Theatre, she claimed to be a native of Pondicherry.  Legacy  A poster of Nala Damajanti has been noted as \\"one of the most beautiful\\" to have come out of the Folies Bergƒóre. Even in the early 21st century, her posters are widely reproduced. Nala Damajanti's image is thought to have inspired popular folk depictions of the African water spirit Mami Wata and of the Dominican spiritual figure Santa Marta la Dominadora. The proximate source of this transmission may have been a calendar published in Bombay, India in 1955, which reproduced a Maladamajaute image. La Charmeuse de serpents by Henri Rousseau (1907) Nala Damajanti is thought to have been an inspiration for a limited series of highly prized automata produced in 1907 by the noted French firm Roullet & Decamps titled \\"la Charmeuse de Serpent,\\" one of which was auctioned for a then-record price in 1977. A 1907 painting by Henri Rousseau with the same theme, titled La Charmeuse de serpents (\\"The snake charmer\\") may have been inspired by the same source.

Life Rather little is known of Anna's life. She was born in Old Aberdeen, youngest daughter to Lilias Forbes of Disblair and her husband Thomas Gordon (1714‚Äì1797), who was the professor of humanity at King's College, Aberdeen. Details of Anna's education are unclear. On 13 December 1788 she married the Revd Dr Andrew Brown (c. 1744‚Äì1805), who, following work as a chaplain in the army, became minister of Falkland, Fife (1784‚Äì1802), and then Tranent. Thus Anna is widely known among scholars as Mrs Brown of Falkland. However, Anna is famed as a collector of Scottish ballads. Fifty of Anna's ballads were written down between about 1783 and 1801; some were published by Walter Scott and Robert Jamieson in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802) and Popular Ballads and Songs (1806). 27 of the ‚ÄòA‚Äô texts in English and Scottish Popular Ballads (1882‚Äì98) by Francis James Child were supplied by Anna. She is an important source, for example, of a text of Thomas the Rhymer. The sources of Anna's repertory are therefore viewed as an important question; she seems to have learned it as a child from her mother, her mother's sister Anne Forbes (Mrs Farquharson of Allanaquoich), and from an unnamed nursemaid. Music was prominent in her family background. However, access to music was in Scotland at the time highly gendered: membership of, for example, the Aberdeen Musical Society (to which Anna's father belonged) was closed to women. 'Anna Gordon's father expressed surprise at his daughter's skill in balladry and confessed that the words and tunes were previously unknown to him (as they were to his correspondent, the antiquary William Tytler, 1711‚Äì1792).'William Donaldson, ‚ÄòGordon, Anna (1747‚Äì1810)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004): doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/55496. Whatever the precise relationship of Anna's ballads to earlier oral tradition, Anna's correspondence reveals 'a woman with a well-defined aesthetic sense, an established knowledge of literature and ballad scholarship, and some sense of the importance of her contributions to that scholarship'.Julie Henigan, review of The Ballad Repertoire of Anna Gordon, Mrs Brown of Falkland, ed. by Sigrid Rieuwerts, The Scottish Text Society, Fifth Series, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2011) , in JFR: Journal of Folklore Research, An International Journal of Folklore and Ethnomusicology (2011), http://www.jfr.indiana.edu/review.php?id=1305. Literary significance The literary significance of Anna Gordon's ballads is undisputed‚Äîbut its precise character has been a matter of considerable debate: ::The ballad repertoire of Anna Gordon (alternately known as Mrs. Brown of Falkland) has generated both admiration and controversy since the end of the eighteenth century, when the texts were first recorded. Dismissed by Ritson as new-fangled and by Scott as inauthentic, Mrs. Brown‚Äôs ballads were considered exemplary by both Robert Jamieson and, later, Francis James Child, who gave her variants pride of place in The English and Scottish Popular Ballads as instances of the best the popular ballad tradition had to offer. In the twentieth century, the differences between her renditions of several specific ballads became the focus of scholarly attention‚Äîheld up by Bertrand Bronson as examples of oral re-creation and subsequently used by other scholars as ammunition in the conflict over the applicability of oral-formulaic theory to European balladry.Julie Henigan, review of The Ballad Repertoire of Anna Gordon, Mrs Brown of Falkland, ed. by Sigrid Rieuwerts, The Scottish Text Society, Fifth Series, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2011) , in JFR: Journal of Folklore Research, An International Journal of Folklore and Ethnomusicology (2011), http://www.jfr.indiana.edu/review.php?id=1305. Whatever the case, Anna's ballads seem to represent an important insight into eighteenth-century women's literature: :: Anna Gordon's ballads are framed from an explicitly female, indeed even feminist, perspective, and carry behind their courtly and magical fa√ßade a frequently brutal reality. The ambience is of love and death, the cruelties of fate and chance, and of perilous, enchanted wooings. The songs chart their youthful heroines' transition from secure maternal households to the dangerous world of men and their violently possessive female kin, at whose hands the protagonists risk not merely rejection but sometimes mutilation or even death. The ballads speak of murderous sexual rivalry between female siblings and hint at infanticide as a form of revenge upon treacherous males. Adventures in the magical greenwood, a metaphor for transgressive sexuality, have a strong appeal but usually alarming consequences. Indeed, the dangers of sex are stressed on every side, along with the sheer physical hazard of being female.William Donaldson, ‚ÄòGordon, Anna (1747‚Äì1810)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004): doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/55496.

In Australia she played Edward Clark's De Luxe Annie from April 1918 in Sydney and from July in Melbourne, where she married Lieutenant Ellis of the Royal Field Artillery, whom she had met on board the ship (he had been wounded in action and was on furlough). Her company next played Walter Hackett's The Invisible Foe then The Eyes of Youth. In 1919 she triumphantly toured Adelaide, Brisbane, Newcastle and New Zealand with revivals of De Luxe Annie and The Eyes of Youth. She returned to Sydney in 1920 with Monckton Hoffe's The Little Damozel and Kindling, then again toured with revivals before retiring in September 1920 to start a family. She returned in 1922, starring in Edward Knoblock's My Lady's Dress with Frank Harvey, Henry Arthur Jones's The Lie, which toured to Adelaide and with revivals of her earlier successes in Perth and Hobart, followed in 1923 with a Sydney season of revivals and The Flaw, which she co-wrote with Doris Egerton Jones, and the farce French Leave, followed by another season of revivals in the other States. She left in April 1924 for London to visit her sister Marie Polini and her husband Owen Nares, both actors.

Gillam introduced merino rams into the flock in 1899. A cyclone passed through the area later the same year depositing of rain at the station and tearing the roof from the old homestead. Gillam became the sole owner of Chirritta at some time prior to 1905. He sold it in 1907 to the Withnell brothers who owned the neighbouring Karratha Station. At the time the property supported about 16,000 sheep and shearing that year produced 288 bales of wool.

This Rogers-Trigger hierarchy in billing was used not only on posters and in screen credits, it was also commonly used in newspaper ads and cited in related film reviews. Also featured in the film are Roy's sidekick George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes and Rogers' future wife Dale Evans. Produced and distributed by Republic Pictures, Don't Fence Me In is part of a long-running series of singing-cowboy films released by that company to showcase Rogers' musical talents and equestrian skills, as well as Trigger's abilities at performing impressive stunts and tricks.Hurst, Richard M. (2007). Republic Studios: Beyond Poverty Row and the Majors. Latham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, a subsidiary of Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, 2007; p. 232. Plot The plot is a contemporary one, set in the United States in 1945. Toni Ames (Dale Evans), a \\"big-city\\" magazine reporter, is preparing to travel on assignment to the small western town of Twin Wells. Her editor instructs her to gather information and take photographs for an article about \\"Wildcat\\" Kelly, a legendary bandit who 35 years earlier was shot and killed for a $50,000 reward and buried in Twin Wells. Toni's boss informs her, however, that the real Wildcat may not have died in 1910. He says an old man named McCoy recently confessed on his deathbed that he and his unnamed partner had collected the large reward for shooting Wildcat, but the man who was killed and buried was not the real outlaw, only someone who looked like him. Once in Twin Wells, Toni meets dude rancher Roy Rogers and his best friend Gabby Whittaker (George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes). She tells them she is a writing a book about western outlaws, not that she is a reporter. Later, when she discovers that Gabby is really the \\"dead\\" Wildcat Kelly, Roy implores her not to divulge his secret; it will only cause trouble for Gabby, who has been a model citizen since he faked his death. Despite Roy's pleas, Toni prints her magazine story, along with photographs of Gabby. The news that public funds had been misspent on a phony reward, even so long ago, angers the state's current governor (Paul Harvey), and he orders an investigation of Gabby. The news also prompts an unidentified gunman to shoot the former bandit and then flee. Fortunately, Gabby is only wounded. Toni now helps Roy to identify Gabby's attacker, Cliff Anson (Marc Lawrence), and to track him to the \\"Westward Ho Resort\\" owned by Henry Bennett (Moroni Olsen). Roy, Toni, and their friends take jobs as entertainers there to learn what connection Anson has to Bennett. Anson soon panics when he sees Gabby visiting the resort, and he tells Bennett, who kills Anson and then implicates Gabby for the murder. Running from the police, Gabby, Roy, and Toni soon manage to meet with the local sheriff (Tom London) to explain what truly happened. Gabby recounts how as Wildcat back in 1910, he staged his death so he could begin a constructive, law-abiding life with a new name. A large \\"sack of sand\\" was put in his casket to simulate the weight of a corpse; however, Bennett and his accomplice McCoy later substituted a real body for the sand so they could claim the reward for killing Wildcat. As Gabby and Roy continue to talk with the sheriff, Bennett and his gang suddenly arrive; but Roy, Gabby and their allies overpower the bad guys and have them arrested. Months later, the exonerated Gabby discusses his criminal past with the governor. He tells the chief executive that he kept none of the money he stole as an outlaw; instead, he gave most of it to charities, donated some to the governor's own political campaign, and used the rest to buy the available Western Ho Resort to serve as an exclusive vacation site for state employees.

Since his first starring role in Under Western Stars seven years earlier, he had evolved into a major star within the subtype of Westerns known as \\"singing-cowboy pictures\\". Republic Pictures, which produced and distributed Don't Fence Me In, would continue to release several of Rogers' films every year until the final months of 1951.Pals of the Golden West, released six years after Don't Fence Me In, would be Roy Rogers' final singing-cowboy film for Republic Pictures. Produced on a relatively low budget, with a running time of 71 minutes, Don't Fence Me In‚Äîlike Rogers' other films in this period‚Äîwas categorized as a \\"B\\"-grade production and presented at theaters as a second feature in double billings or showcased on Saturday mornings and afternoons for Roy's legions of younger fans. Despite that status or secondary grade in perceived \\"quality\\" compared to top-billed feature films, Don't Fence Me In attracted greater coverage and more reviews from trade publications and newspapers than other B films due to Roy Roger's extraordinary popularity. One of the more widely read trade papers in 1945, The Film Daily in New York, described Don't Fence Me In as a well-cast \\"Knockout Western Musical With All the Qualities For Top Feature Billing\\":\\"Don‚Äôt Fence Me In\\", review, The Film Daily (New York, N.Y.), October 22, 1945, page 10.

It is located on north-western slopes of Mount Thompson in Brisbane, Australia. The street address is Nursery Road in Holland Park. It was established in 1934 as the first crematorium in Queensland. History The crematorium was the first in Queensland and was constructed after many decades of lobbying and public discussion, culminating in a group of citizens meeting and forming the Brisbane Crematorium Limited in 1930. Shares were sold in the company and a suitable site was purchased in 1933. Early designs were done by Richard Gailey, Junior (the son and business partner of Richard Gailey). However, Melbourne architects Charles and Frank Heath were appointed as the crematorium designers and worked in partnership with Brisbane architects GHM Addison and Son and HS Macdonald who prepared further plans and specifications. Artist William Bustard was engaged to work on a canvas mural representing the awakening from death which was positioned over the catafalque in the chapel. Sculptor Daphne Mayo was commissioned to create three relief works, Grief and Hope for the front facade and one of a boy scattering seed, representing the continuation of life, for the original columbarium. The first cremation service 11 September 1934 Mount Thompson Crematorium officially opened on Sunday 9 September 1934. The first cremation service was held on the morning of 11 September 1934. A religious service for Neil Richmond Rose of Wynnum, Queensland was held at 10.30am followed by a non-religious one for Ernest Charles Fletcher of Ularunda Station, central Queensland at 2.30pm. During the Second World War, there were 88 Australian service personnel cremated here whose remains rest at the crematorium and are commemorated by Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) memorial here. Another 36 Australian service personnel cremated here whose remains were scattered or buried at places where CWGC commemoration was not possible are commemorated on the CWGC's Queensland Cremation Memorial in Lutwyche Cemetery. They included First World War fighter ace Roy Phillipps who was killed flying while serving in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1941. In addition a Royal Australian Artillery soldier cremated here is, exceptionally, commemorated on the Victoria Cremation Memorial in Melbourne.https://www.cwgc.org/find-war- dead/casualty/2774364/brew,-william-noel/ Over the years further columbaria and gardens were constructed, adjacent land acquired and facilities expanded. By 1962 an additional chapel had been built, designed by Adrian Pooley. The new chapel was designated the East Chapel and the original, the West Chapel. Renowned architect Karl Langer received commissions in the 1960s to design a number of new columbaria and to modify the West Chapel including new pews, kneeling rails, a new marble lined pulpit and removal of Bustard's original mural with reworking of the walls and catafalque surrounds.‚ÄòWest Chapel alterations July 1962‚Äô, ‚ÄòWest Chapel alterations October 1966‚Äô, Karl Langer architectural drawings, [Roll 3/6, R83/3/6], [Roll 21/8, R83/21/8], State Library of Queensland West Chapel interior 2015 The West Chapel underwent five months restoration commencing in 2007 and reopening in February 2008. The chapel was returned to its original configuration with removal of pews and installation of single chairs as well as restoration of terrazzo flooring, lead lighting and the catafalque and its surrounds. A reproduction by Scott Christensen of William Bustard's original mural painting was also commissioned and installed.

The French Navy named her Torride around end-1797 and brought her into Toulon, where they refitted her as a gun-vessel. The Royal Navy captured her in 1798 at Abukir and took her into service as HMS Torride. She served at the siege of Acre in 1799, where the French recaptured her on 25 August for a few hours before the British recaptured her. She served in the Mediterranean and was last listed in 1802. French career She was listed on 18 August 1798 as being stationed near Lake \\"Madieh\\" to protect the lines of communication between Rosetta and Abukir. Capture British account: On 25 August 1798 boats from cut Torride out from under the guns of the castle of Berquier (Abu Kir) and captured Torride in a hard-fought action lasting 15 minutes. Torride had a crew of 70 men under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Martin Bedat (or Bedar), and was armed with three 18-pounder guns and four swivel guns. Despite fire from the castle, the British suffered only two men wounded, including Lieutenant William Debusk, who led the attack; the French suffered four men killed, and ten wounded, including Bedat. Captain Thomas Foley of Goliath sent Bedat ashore under a flag of truce. Several French prisoners escaped by jumping overboard and swimming ashore. French account: French Adjutant-general Escale, in a letter to General Kl√©ber, states that if one didn't know the facts of Torrides capture one would have thought that treason had to have been involved. She had no watch, no guards, the crew was asleep, and the wicks from which the guns could be lit were not lighted. The crew was able to fire only three gun shots before the British boarding party was already on board. Her captain redeemed himself by fighting bravely, sustaining eight wounds. In a letter dated 4 September, Napoleon wrote to General Menou that he was not surprised at what had happened with Torride. Recent developments (i.e., the Battle of the Nile), had eroded navy morale, and it had been stupid to have left her in such an exposed position. In a letter dated 11 January 1799 Napoleon wrote to Contre-Amiral Ganteaume that he should have the aviso Torride and a second aviso carry into Lake Bourlos the artillery for three batteries: two Gomer mortars of \\"12 pouces\\", four Gomer mortars of \\"8 pouces\\", four 24-pounder guns, two grills for heating shot, 150 cartridges per mortar, and 200 cartridges per gun.A \\"pouce\\", literally a \\"thumb\\", was an inch, though the French inch measured 2.707 cm, whereas the modern British inch measures 2.54 cm. Apparently it had slipped Napoleon's mind that Torride was now serving the Royal Navy. British career The British took Torride into service. She participated in the ongoing blockade of Alexandria where she apparently was under the command of Midshipman William Autridge. (Autridge was promoted to Lieutenant in 1800.)Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, p.106. Early in March 1799 Captain Sir Sidney Smith in {shipFrench shipTigre 17932}} arrived off Alexandria, to relieve Captain Troubridge. Smith brought with him the French armed galiot Marianne, which Tigre had captured two days earlier. On 7 March, Troubridge sailed in , leaving Smith with Tigre, , Alliance, Marianne, and Torride. Smith arrived at Acre on 15 March, Theseus, which had left earlier, having arrived two days earlier. On 18 March 1799 Torride was coming around Mount Carmel when she encountered a French flotilla consisting of a corvette and nine gun-vessels that were bringing siege guns to French forces marching to capture Acre. They captured Torride. However, within hours, Smith was able to intercept the flotilla, which he had been expecting. The British captured seven of the gun- vessels, including Torride. Smith immediately put the guns and supplies on the gun vessels to use to help the denizens of the city resist the French, and the gun-vessels to harass them. Smith anchored Tigre and Theseus, one on each side of the town, so their broadsides could assist the defence. The gun-vessels were of shallower draft and so could come in closer. Together, they helped repel repeated French assaults. On 21 March the gun-vessels supported the boats of Tigre and Theseus in their unsuccessful attempt to cut out four sailing lighters from the port of Ca√Øffa. The lighters had arrived on the 18th from Alexandria and had brought supplies for the French army. The French attacked multiple times between 19 March and 10 May before Napoleon finally gave up. On 21 May he destroyed his siege train and retreated back to Egypt, having lost 2,200 men dead, 1,000 of them to the plague. After Napoleon's failure at Acre, Smith sailed with his squadron on 12 June. He proceeded first to Beruta road, and then to Larnica road, Cyprus, in order to refit his little squadron. He and Tigre then departed for Constantinople; Alliance and the gun- vessels remaining in the theatre. In September 1800 Torride was listed as being on the Lisbon, Gibraltar, and Mediterranean station.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.245. She was last listed in 1802.

Played on game boards at tables with four players per board, each gameplay session is followed by a detailed debriefing in which participants relate the simulation experience to their own work and gain insights for performance improvement. The game simulates the challenge of managing a hospital during a 24-hour period. Players perform distinct functions, but they come to realize that they also depend on one another. While the game was designed to teach systems thinking, it has served diverse learning objectives across many industries and cultures. Each session includes 1.5 hours of game play followed by approximately 1.5 to 2 hours of debrief and discussion. Background The Friday Night at the ER game was developed in 1992 by Breakthrough Learning, Inc., a consulting and training firm based in Morgan Hill, California. Its initial purpose was to broadly teach people to think systemically, collaborating across functional boundaries to achieve system goals. The game's design objectives were: * to create an experiential learning tool that would engage people in a learning process; * to simulate and illustrate dynamics that are common to complex systems; and * to promote an understanding of key systems principles in a way that enables people to gain insight about their relevance. Since its initial release, the Friday Night at the ER game has found use for a broader range of learning objectives within diverse organizations. Demonstrating the universality of systems principles, the game is in use by service organizations, manufacturing companies, government agencies, academic institutions and others in at least 30 countries. History and development A predecessor learning game, The Beer Distribution Game, demonstrated effective team learning about the behavior of complex systems through an experiential activity. In 1990, Peter Senge published The Fifth Discipline and popularized systems thinking as a discipline essential to learning organizations. The Friday Night at the ER game has its origins in a business case that took place in 1990 at San Jose Medical Center, in San Jose, California, where a persistent problem of decreasing capacity for emergency patients was resolved using a system dynamics study that included a simulation model of patient flow. A high-leverage intervention to resolve the problem required collaboration across departments to share nursing staff during times of peak emergency demand. In 1992, healthcare management consultant Bette Gardner created the Friday Night at the ER game, loosely based on that case, to teach management principles and the practice of systems thinking within healthcare and other organizations.Gardner, Bette; DeMello, Steve (July/August 1993).\\"Transformational leadership. Systems thinking in action.\\" Healthcare Forum Journal, 36(4):25-8. The game development process included a computer- based simulation model (using the IThink simulation modelling environment), populated with time-of-day, day-of-week hospital arrival rates, and other data from public and private sources. The game was pilot tested with groups and presented at conferences starting in 1992. In 1997, the Friday Night at the ER game was published in electronic form in Activating the Fifth Discipline, a PC based multimedia education program . Although the Friday Night at the ER game depicts a hospital based in the United States, it has been adopted and widely used as a team-learning tool both within the healthcare field and beyond, finding use across diverse industries including other service organizations, manufacturing companies, government agencies, and academic institutions. The Friday Night at the ER game has been used for training in at least 30 countries. In 2014, an updated version of the Friday Night at the ER game was released with modernized and upgraded game and support materials. Reports of the effectiveness of Friday Night at the ER are largely based on Likert surveys, testimonials and Net Promoter surveys. In 2018, educators at University of North Carolina at Greensboro published results of research in which students were assessed before and after using Friday Night at the ER. They concluded that the Friday Night at the ER activity is a useful teaching strategy for complex problem solving and application of systems thinking concepts. Program structure Participants in a group (from 4 to 200 people) are assembled at tables equipped with game boards and associated materials. A program leader or coordinator provides verbal instructions; then participants play the game on their own for approximately one hour. The gameplay is followed by scoring to measure team performance. After a brief stretch break, participants reconvene for a debriefing. The debrief is facilitated by the program leader with a structured progression of discussion questions, reflection exercises, didactic presentation, and group tasks to bring to light key lessons of the experience, its relevance to the group and how participants will put lessons into practice after the program. The structure of the program may be varied. For example, the gameplay's 24-hour simulation may be conducted in two 12-hour segments with a short debrief or planning meeting in between segments. Another variation has groups playing in separate rooms with a slightly different instruction or game-board structure in each room so that behavior and results can be compared. In addition to variations in the gameplay, the structure and content of the debrief may be designed to teach either a narrow or broad purpose. The program generally requires 3.5 to 4 hours to complete the gameplay and debrief. Gameplay and scoring At each four-person table, players each manage one of four departments in a hospital: Emergency, Surgery, Critical Care, and Step Down. The gameboard hospital is consolidated and simplified (relative to reality) to enable players to progress through a simulated 24 hours in just one hour. Each department contains spaces in which patients are treated by staff, and game cards determine new patient arrivals as well as ‚Äúready to exit‚Äù indicators for patients. The game board may be seen as a hybrid version of a stock-flow map or process-flow chart. Players‚Äô management tasks include determining staffing levels, accepting internal patient transfers, and remaining open to additional patients or diverting new ambulance arrivals. Among the other details of the gameplay are ‚Äúevents‚Äù that occur (e.g., a doctor is late, a room is being renovated, a staff member goes home sick), requiring reaction and management by players. Demand rates in the gameplay, by hour, from mid-day Friday to mid- day Saturday, represent the typical pattern seen in hospitals. Emergency arrivals ramp up during Friday night (a time when people more often engage in risky behaviors that lead to emergencies); while arrivals to other departments in the hospital decrease as the weekend begins. A portion of Emergency arrivals flow through to other departments, so players experience the ripple effect of demand and the challenge of interdepartmental hand-offs. Consequences of player decisions in the gameplay are both local and systemic. The structure of the game board, role assignments and the accounting system influence players to focus on department performance; yet as the game progresses it becomes evident that the more one tries to optimize a part, the worse the system as a whole performs. During the gameplay, players keep track of certain data on paperwork forms at each department. Following the gameplay, individuals at each table contribute to calculating a team score that reflects the quality of service they delivered and financial performance. Teams scores are displayed to provide benchmarks and to enable participants to relate behavior to performance. Debriefing A standard debrief to teach applied systems thinking is described in the Friday Night at the ER Guide for Program Leaders with presentation slides to support key points. The debrief includes team reflection exercises, guided group discussion, didactic presentation and group tasks. During the debrief, participants are guided to focus on collaboration, innovation and data-driven decision-making as key strategies necessary for successful system performance. These three strategies are examined and they are shown to be interdependent. Participants see that these three strategies produce excellent performance in the gameplay, and that the same applies to their real-world endeavors within organizations. While these three strategies are not new ideas to most participants, the question is posed in the debrief, ‚ÄúWhy, then, don‚Äôt we routinely put these strategies into day- to-day practice?‚Äù‚Äîas they demonstrated in the gameplay and as seen in the real world? An axiom from the field of system dynamics, ‚Äústructure drives behavior,‚Äù is presented and participants are led through an exercise in which they examine how various structures within their organization may (unintentionally) inhibit desired behaviors. Numerous variations to the standard debrief have been reported. Uses Typical objectives for use of the Friday Night at the ER game, settings in which it is used and reported outcomes are shown below. Examples of Objectives *Improve collaboration across business units. *Prepare groups for a major change initiative. *Introduce principles and methods of Systems Thinking, Balanced Scorecards, Lean, Theory of Constraints, Kaizen, Process Improvement, Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, Agile and other improvement disciplines. *Clarify success factors and support leadership development in areas such as teamwork, customer satisfaction, conflict management, change management. *Team building.

He was a friend of Edward Dayes and Thomas Campbell, and his patrons included Lord Sedley (Henry Venables- Vernon, 3rd Baron Vernon) and George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick  Early career  John Higton was born in Virginia in 1775, the son of John Higton, Sr. His father was a cotton planter and Loyalist, who served in Cornwallis' Central Division. John Higton, Sr. was granted land in Godmanchester, Quebec, but returned to Britain with Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, and became a cotton merchant, establishing John Higton & Co in London and Manchester. While Higton considered himself an Englishman, he looked back on his boyhood in North America with fondness. He would recount his earliest memories were as a Hammerman assisting the Blacksmiths of the Division's Ordnance Corps tend the forge and horses. Higton was privately educated, and was encouraged to paint from an early age by his father, who he succeeded in business. He was a follower of Edward Dayes, however it is thought he was given support to develop his own style and exhibit his paintings by Mr. Wheble, the editor of The Sporting Magazine, who said of him in 1813, whilst commenting on J. M. W. Turner and John Constable, that: \\"Portraits of Dogs at Ampthill Park - Both of these performances have merit. The last is to us, who have watched the improving style of Mr. Higton, a proof that perseverance and study will always be sure to succeed.\\"  Marriage and maturity  John fell in love with Mary Sheldon, the cousin of John Sheldon who was at that time Professor of Anatomy at the Royal Academy, and they were married in 1794. They lived in Southwark, London, and attended church at St Mary's, being acquainted with William Blake. Higton was well known to a number of publishers including Wheble and his friend John Nichols. John and Mary had seven children, their oldest son John was born in 1795. He was raised with the expectation that he would run the family business. Of their other sons only William Higton lived to old age, whilst Richard died in his mid thirties. In later life John and Mary are known to have been friends of Thomas Campbell, whose father had lived in Virginia and may have been a family friend, and his biographer William Beattie for whom Turner executed the plates. By 1819 Mr. Brewster, Higton's business partner, had run up personal debts of ¬£74,000. Brewster filed for bankruptcy, and his creditors turned to Higton to satisfy the debt. Higton contested joint liability, but was forced to sell his house on Cornhill, and family home and offices in Blackfriars The Times, 1819 and probably the Cotton Mill on Ancoats Lane, Manchester Royal Sun Alliance Insurance deed, 1797. This was detrimental to Higton's activity as an artist, and possibly his health. He died on 23 December 1827, being buried in the family plot at St Mary's, Newington.  Patronage  Higton's patrons included Lord Sedley, for whom he executed a number of paintings, particularly relating to dogs, and George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick. It had also been speculated that John FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory was also a Patron given Higton's painting of Dogs at Ampthill Park. It was thought that Higton was introduced to George Greville by Lord Sedley, a friend of Charles Francis Greville. However it is now understood that Greville's wife, Henrietta Vernon, was a cousin of Lord Sedley (later Venables-Vernon) via her father Richard Vernon, and the half sister of John FitzPatrick, Lord Gowran (later 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory) via the first marriage of her Mother (Lady Evelyn Leveson-Gower). Therefore, Higton's portraits of Warwick Castle, combined with those of Dogs belonging to George Greville, Lord Sedley, and John Fitzpatrick, perhaps reflect a more intimate relationship with the family, and their circle, than was understood. The Greville's were acquainted to John Sheldon, Wheble and Nichols who were also Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

It is considered part of Jesus' passion. According to the gospel narratives, Jesus had predicted that he would be mocked (Matthew 20:19, Mark 10:34, and Luke 18:32). The mocking of Christ took place in three stages: immediately following his trial, immediately following his condemnation by Pontius Pilate, and when he was being crucified. The New Testament narratives of Jesus being mocked are filled with irony, while the mockery focuses on Jesus' prophetic and kingly roles.Larry Chouinard, Matthew (1997), p. 487.David L. Tiede, Luke (1988), p. 398. First stage Gerrit van Honthorst, The Mocking of Christ, c. 1617 After Jesus' condemnation by the Sanhedrin, some spat on him (Mark 14:65). He was blindfolded and beaten, and then mocked: \\"Prophesy! Who hit you?\\" (Luke 22:63). This was done by those men who \\"held Jesus\\" (Luke 22:63, King James Version). The New International Version translates this as \\"the men who were guarding Jesus\\", but Joel B. Green takes the phrase to refer to the \\"Chief priests, the officers of the temple police, and the elders\\" mentioned in verse 52. Green suggests that Jesus suffers the mockery that is typical of prophets, and that his suffering suggests his \\"solidarity with God's agents who speak on God's behalf and are rejected.\\"Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke (1997), p. 789. Susan R. Garrett sees Mark's inclusion of the mockery as an example of irony, since Jesus is indeed a prophet, at the very moment his prophecy that Peter would deny him was being fulfilled.Susan R. Garrett, The Temptations of Jesus in Mark's Gospel (1998), p. 118. The prophetic assignment is not always portrayed as positive in the Bible,Commentary on Jeremiah, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004Isaiah (Commentary), John Goldingay, Hendrickson, 2001Commentary on Isaiah 6:8-13, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004 and prophets were often the target of persecution and opposition.‚Äô‚ÄôJeremiah (Prophet)‚Äô‚Äô, The Anchor Bible Dictionary Volume 3, Doubleday, 1992 Second stage √âdouard Manet, Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers, c. 1865 After his condemnation by Pontius Pilate, Jesus was flogged and mocked by Roman soldiers. They clothed him with a \\"purple\\" () or \\"scarlet\\" () robe symbolizing a royal gown since purple was a royal color, put a crown of thorns on his head symbolizing a royal crown, and put a staff in his hand symbolizing a scepter. They knelt before him and said, \\"Hail, king of the Jews!\\" (). This was done as a mockery of Jesus' kingship. After this, they spat on him, and struck him on the head with the staff repeatedly. Peter Leithart notes that at the end of the scene, the soldiers \\"reverse the whole coronation with an anti- coronation. They spit in contempt instead of kneeling in reverence, pull the scepter from Jesus‚Äô hand and beat His crowned head with it, strip off the scarlet robe and replace it with Jesus‚Äô own robe.\\" Leithart goes on to suggest that, at this point, the Romans \\"remove the veil of irony and reveal what they really think\\" about the Jews and their God. Peter Leithart, God is Mocked, Credenda/Agenda. The crowning/de-crowning of a mock king is what Mikhail Bakhtin calls the \\"carnivalesque.\\" Carnivalesque expresses ‚Äúlife drawn out of its usual rut‚Äù and ‚Äúthe reverse side of the world (monde √† l‚Äôenvers)\\" in which normally suppressed voices of the culture mock everyday social hierarchies and the voices of the status quo. Mikhail Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoevsky‚Äôs Poetics. Theory and History of Literature, Vol. 8. Ed. and trans. by Caryl Emerson. (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1984), 122. The soldiers not only mock Jesus; they mock the whole notion of kingship modeled on this world. The irony is rich because the type of king they mock‚Äîone who lords over others with scepter, crown, and robe‚Äîis not the type of king Jesus is or the type of kingdom he brings (cf. Mark 10:45 and Son of man came to serve). Their mockery speaks truth beyond what they could possibly know.James L. Resseguie, \\"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,\\" in Religions, 10 (3) 217), 3-4. Robert J. Miller suggests that the gospel account is deeply ironic since Jesus is exercising his kingship through submission and suffering: \\"the Roman legionnaires have unwittingly furthered God's secret purposes by dressing Jesus up as a king.\\"Robert J. Miller, The Complete Gospels (1994), p. 50 In fact, the irony operates on two levels. James L. Resseguie points out that there is verbal irony in the way the soldiers \\"mock Jesus as a dismal failure and a pretend king\\" (that is, the soldiers are themselves being ironic) as well as dramatic irony in that the readers \\"know that the acclamation rings true in ways that the soldiers could not possibly understand.\\"James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction (2005), p. 74; see also \\"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations, https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/10/3/217. Luke 23:11 also mentions that \\"Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him\\" (New Revised Standard Version). Third stage Hendrick ter Brugghen, The Mocking of Christ, c. 1625 Jesus was also mocked while he was on the cross. According to Mark 15:29-30, this was done by those who passed by and hurled insults at him and told him to come down from the cross. Mark 15:31-32 points out that \\"the chief priests and the teachers of the law\\" also mocked him among themselves, saying: \\"He saved others, but he can‚Äôt save himself! Let this Messiah, this king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.\\" Finally, those crucified with Jesus also heaped insults at him (Mark 15:32). Luke 23:36-37 mentions mocking by Roman soldiers: \\"The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, 'If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!'\\" (New Revised Standard Version). In Matthew 27:42 people, priest and the elders mock Jesus, and shout at him while he is hanging on the cross: \\"He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.\\" According to Luke 23:39, one criminal on his left who hung there together with Jesus on the cross, hurled insults at Jesus: \\"Aren't you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!\\" Thus, whereas the first stage involves mockery by Jews, and the second stage mockery by gentiles, the third stage has both together.Klaas Schilder, Christ on Trial (1939), p. 177. Leithart notes that at this point \\"Jews and Gentiles, governors and criminals, scribes and commoners, all humanity joins in a single chorus of blasphemy.\\" Timothy C. Gray notes that in the Gospel of Mark, the mocking of Jesus on the cross \\"takes up the two charges leveled against Jesus at his trial\\": firstly, that Jesus \\"threatened the temple with destruction\\" (14:58 and 15:29); secondly, that Jesus \\"claimed to be the Messiah\\" (14:61-62 and 15:31-32).Timothy C. Gray, The Temple in the Gospel of Mark: A Study in Its Narrative Role (2008), p. 181. Theological significance Mateo Cerezo, Ecce Homo, 1650 Peter Leithart argues that in the person of Jesus, God himself was mocked. He suggests that \\"for Matthew, the cross is mainly about man‚Äôs mockery of God,\\" and notes that while Paul says in Galatians 6:7 that \\"God is not mocked\\", this is precisely because God has been mocked. Many Christians see Jesus' suffering as being redemptive. Francis Foulkes argues that the emphasis in the New Testament is on Jesus' suffering and death being \\"for us\\".Francis Foulkes, Death of Christ, Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology. In this way, some Christians see the mockery that Jesus endured as being borne on their behalf. For example, Philip Bliss wrote in his hymn, \\"Hallelujah! What a Savior\\": > Bearing shame and scoffing rude, In my place condemned He stood; Sealed my > pardon with His blood. Hallelujah! What a Savior!The Cyber Hymnal: > Hallelujah! What a Savior The mockery of Jesus is also seen by many Christians in the servant songs, such as in Isaiah 50:6 where > I gave my back to those who strike, and my cheeks to those who pull out the > beard; I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting. Which is in remarkable contrast with the forward looking following verse, Isaiah 50:7 > Because the Sovereign Lord helps me, I will not be disgraced. Therefore have > I set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame. The scene when Jesus was mocked while he was on the cross, is also a manifestation of the mercy of God through Jesus, who himself is mocked, humiliated and in pain. Two men were crucified at the same time as Jesus, one on his right hand and one on his left (, , , ), which Mark interprets as fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah . According to Matthew and Mark, respectively, both of the \\"thieves\\" mocked Jesus (, ); Luke however, mentions that: > 39 Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, \\"Are you > not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.\\" 40 The other, however, rebuking him, > said in reply, \\"Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same > condemnation? 41 And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence > we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing > criminal.\\" 42 Then he said, \\"Jesus, remember me when you come into your > kingdom.\\" 43 He replied to him, \\"Amen I say to you today you will be with me > in Paradise.\\" Jesus promised to this thief that he will be with him in the Paradise, right in front of those who were mocking him. God saves through Jesus, because God is full of mercy, a mercy revealed through Jesus Christ, that says to a thief: \\"Today you will be with me in Paradise.\\" See also *Flagellation of Christ *Crown of thorns *Ecce homo References Bibliography * * External links * Category:Passion of Jesus ","title":"Mocking of Jesus"},{"id":"42151528","text":"Sir Thomas Brydges (died 14 November 1559) was an English landowner, a royal office holder and MP for Oxfordshire in first parliament of Elizabeth I (January 1559). Biography Brydges was the second son of Sir Giles Brydges (died 1511) of Coberley, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Isabel Baynham. His elder brother was John, Lord Chandos, and his patronage at court helped Thomas Brydges' career. As a substantial landowner and member of the Oxfordshire gentry Brydges carried out various duties for his sovereign. In 1544 he mustered troops for the French campaign, and he was later posted to Boulogne (besieged during the campaign) as surveyor. He was in 1548 steward of the hundred of Chadlington and of the royal manors of Burford and Minster Lovell, and keeper of Wychwood Forest and of the parks of Langley and Cornbury. In 1554 as deputy lieutenant of the Tower (a post he held under his brother who was the Lieutenant) he was present at the execution of Lady Jane Grey. He had been well rewarded by King Edward VI's regime for his loyalty and was granted many abbey lands. He remained loyal to the Tudor dynasty and during the reign of Mary as Justice of the Peace in Oxfordshire, he attended the burning of Thomas Cranmer at Oxford in 1556 .

At Opika, she proved herself to be an improvisational and expressive singer, as well as an accomplished musical arranger. Her songs placed an emphasis on vocal harmonies, and hits such as Oh√© Suka ya Rhumba and Mokili Makalamba endeared her to a generation.

Towards the end of the 1950s with the close of the Opika label, Eyenga transitioned to the Esengo label as did many colleagues of the time. Her career continued to reach new heights between 1957 and 1958 with the orchestra Rock-A-Mambo where she contributed to such hits as Brigitte, Mabe na yo moko, Dit moninga, Nasepeli mingi, and Zozo moke. Following the closing of Editions Esengo and the breakup of Rock-a-Mambo, in 1960 her career took a brief hiatus until she reappeared in Brazzaville with the orchestra Negro Band where she recorded the memorable songs Adoula and Georgette.

The film stars Will Ferrell, Kevin Hart, Tip 'T.I.' Harris, Alison Brie, and Craig T. Nelson. James King, a wealthy investment bank manager (Ferrell) is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and asks the man who washes his car, Darnell Lewis (Hart) to help him prepare for prison. The film was released March 27, 2015 to negative reviews. It grossed a worldwide total of $111.7 million. Plot James King (Will Ferrell) is an extremely wealthy hedge fund manager at Barrow Funds, run by Martin Barrow (Craig T. Nelson). He is engaged to Martin's daughter Alissa (Alison Brie). James has come to know Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart), who owns a small car wash service in the garage used by James. Darnell and his wife Rita (Edwina Findley) are trying to put their daughter Makayla (Ariana Neal) in a better school, away from the bad neighborhood they live in. During an engagement party for James and Alissa, the FBI arrive and arrest James for fraud and embezzlement. James' lawyer, Peter Penny (Greg Germann), urges him to go for a guilty plea and a likely short sentence, but James refuses and insists that he will be exonerated. Instead, James is found guilty and sentenced to ten years in San Quentin State Prison, with the judge (Elliot Grey) giving him 30 days to get his affairs in order. Though forbidden from crossing county lines, James wants to flee the country with Alissa, but she dumps him. James encounters Darnell and, assuming he has been incarcerated before because he is black, begs him for help and agrees to pay him $30,000 to toughen him up for prison. Darnell, who has little idea of how to act tough, trains James by pepper-spraying him, trying to get him to develop a \\"mad dog\\" face, and creating scenarios in which James must defend himself, but all of these efforts fail miserably. During the training, James gets in touch with Martin and says he is getting help. Barrow, the actual crook, thinks James is onto him and orders a hitman named Gayle (Paul Ben-Victor) to monitor him. With no sign that James is toughening up, Darnell figures that James should be prepared in other ways for prison and takes him to a gay hookup spot for James to learn how to perform oral sex in prison. James can't go through with it and tells Darnell that he will keep going and do whatever it takes to \\"get hard\\". James starts to work out harder and faster, makes shivs, and learns \\"keistering\\" (smuggling contraband in the anus). Darnell simulates a prison raid with help from James' domestic staff. In the chaos, James gets a shiv stuck in his head, so Darnell takes James to his home for Rita to treat it. He has dinner and listens to Darnell make up a story of how he went to prison, which is just a retelling of Boyz n the Hood. James and Darnell resolve for James to join a local gang called the Crenshaw Kings to gain protection in prison. However, Darnell's cousin Russell (T.I.), the gang leader, rebuffs James and redirects him to the Alliance of Whites gang. James is unable to be a convincing racist, leading the gang to think he is a cop, but Darnell rescues him by bursting in with a flamethrower. Darnell and James finally deduce that Martin is the crook. They sneak into his office and find the embezzlement records on Martin's computer. Unfortunately, Gayle finds them and takes back the computer, while informing James that Darnell has never been in prison. Dejected, James returns to the Crenshaw Kings on his own. They accept him and order him to kill someone as their initiation. Darnell arrives in time to convince James to expose Martin. The two sneak onto Martin's yacht to retrieve the computer, only to come across Gayle and his men. James unleashes a series of capoeira moves on them before Martin and Alissa arrive, both confessing to the fraud and embezzlement, a scheme that also included Peter. They try to convince James to run away with them, but he turns them down and heads to a life raft with Darnell. When Gayle shoots the life raft, James pulls out a gun he had \\"keistered\\" and aims it at Gayle. U.S. Marshals suddenly appear, summoned by the ankle monitor that James triggered, having worn it past the county line. Barrow's computer provides the evidence needed to clear James. Martin, Gayle, Alissa, and the henchmen are arrested and James is cleared of all charges. However, he gets arrested for his unlicensed gun. Darnell's training helps James through his six-month prison sentence - something that Martin is unprepared for as he is quickly attacked by inmates when his San Quentin sentence with Peter begins. James spends his sentence helping the FBI retrieve all the assets that Martin stole, while guiding Darnell's investments so that he and Rita are able to open their own carwash. As Darnell drives James home after his release, James announces his intent to celebrate his freedom with a Wall Street Journal and a forty, which he now considers a perfect Sunday.

CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend recorded that audiences gave Get Hard an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote: \\"Laughter trumps political fairness, and Get Hard made me laugh at, and with, situations I hadn‚Äôt thought could tickle me.

Early life Born in Kisbey, Saskatchewan, Peter Ewart grew up in Montreal where he moved with his family at the age of two. Thanks to his father, he developed a love of nature in the still-undeveloped woodland outskirts of the city, and became well versed in camping and the out-of-doors. His summers were spent either in Yarker, Ontario, where his father had been raised, or in Barrington, Nova Scotia, where his mother's family had lived for generations. In 1929, he travelled with his father by train to western Canada, cementing his love for the Prairies, the Rockies and the seacoast of British Columbia. It was to be the first of many such trips across the country by train. In 1938, with high school behind him, Peter decided that art was his calling. He completed a correspondence course and then, with a small inheritance from his grandmother, he attended the Commercial Illustration Studio of New York City.Peter Ewart , Odon Wagner Gallery Career Upon returning to Montreal in 1939, Ewart began to search for work in the art world. He sold his first work to the Exhibits Branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) who commissioned him to produce a ski poster in 1939. In the next two decades, he eventually completed 24 posters for CPR and Canadian Pacific Airlines many of which are featured in the book Canadian Pacific Posters 1883‚Äì1963, by Marc H. Choko and David L. Jones (Meridian Press). Wartime brought a desire to enlist and serve in the war effort. In 1943, he joined the RCAF and worked in the manning depot at Lachine, Quebec. That year he also attended wireless school in Saint John, New Brunswick. His basic training completed, he waited for a posting to #1 Wireless School in Montreal. As a wireless operator he was assigned to Calgary, Alberta, and then was stationed at the air force base at Patricia Bay on Vancouver Island. From there, in 1945, he was sent for a year's assignment as a radar technician to Spider Island, just northwest of Ocean Falls, BC. When not on duty he drew many plein air sketches of the coast and ocean, many of which were the source of seascapes created on his return to Montreal.1940-1944, Peter Ewart, an artist's journey Exhibitions *Alex Fraser Galleries, Vancouver *Royal Canadian Academy *Royal Academy (London, England)Peter Ewart, Saskatchewan NAC *Canadian National Exhibition (Toronto) *Mid-Century Exposition of Canadian Painting *Calgary Stampede (1967) *Alwin Galleries (London, England 1972) *Sheck and Gainsborough Galleries, CalgaryThe Langley Years, Peter Ewart (1918-2001) - A Retrospective. *Downstairs Gallery, Edmonton *Harrison Galleries, Granville, Vancouver *Humberston Edwards Fine Art, West Vancouver *Daniel Izzard's Gallery of the Golden Key, Vancouver *Jack Hambleton Galleries, Kelowna, BC *Pegasus Gallery, Salt Spring Island Works in other media Peter Ewart was a successful poster artist, creating a series of 24 for Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian Pacific Airlines.

Limaye served as a member of the Rajya Sabha (upper house of the Indian parliament) from Maharashtra in the 1960s. Communist Party cadre Limaye was engaged in the struggle for Indian independence, becoming politically active in 1935. In that year he joined the Communist Party of India. He became the foremost leader of the party in Poona, where he recruited and trained many key cadres for the party. Limaye was seen as being close to S.A. Dange. However in 1942 he and his group of followers were expelled from the party. The rationale behind the expulsion was Limaye's opposition to support to the British war effort. Navajivan and Lal Nishan At the time of the expulsion, Limaye's group counted around 200 men. In 1943 Limaye's group founded the Navjivan Sangathana ('New Life Organization'). In 1950 the organization, which was led by Limaye and Yashwant Chavan, discussed a possible merger with the Peasants and Workers Party of India (PWP). The then party leader of the PWP opposed the merger, as he thought that the entry of the Navjivan group would empower his rival Datta Deshmukh within the party. However, the merger went through and the Navjivan Sangathana members were admitted en bloc into the PWP. The presence of the Limaye group in the PWP sharped the internal divisions inside the PWP. In the end the party was split, with the Limaye group joining the splinter group Kamgar Kisan Paksha. Soon that party was split as well, on the issue of its relations with the Communist Party.

As an assistant to Max Sollmann, head of the Lebensborn, she was acquitted at the RuSHA Trial. Biography =Personal life and career= Viermetz studied between 1914 and 1918 at the primary school in Aschaffenburg, and then at a school of higher learning, where she obtained a bachelor's degree. Holding a business degree in 1923, she worked as a reporter from that time to 1932. She married that year, and moved to Austria. She returned to Germany in 1935 and she worked until 1938 in a textile factory in Augsburg, and then as a secretary at a horse racetrack in Munich. She divorced in 1936 and remarried in 1939. In 1937 she became a member of the National Socialist People's Welfare, the National Socialist Women's League and Reichskolonialbund. =Lebensborn= After a brief period of unemployment, Viermetz found a job in the Lebensborn of Munich. From that moment she belonged to the SS-Gefolge. She first worked as a stenographer. From September 1939, she oversaw the department of the placement of single mothers, as well as the department of nursing homes and adoption agencies. For example, one time she was responsible for the transfer of 300 Polish children from Reichsgau Wartheland to the German Reich. From January 1941 to beginning of May 1942, she changed to several different departments within the Lebensborn, such as working in the department of war orphans. From December 1942 until the summer of 1943, Viermetz was commissioner of the Lebensborn for Belgium and Northern France and the Ardennes, and ran an establishment at W√©gimont. During the summer of 1943, it was set aside due to financial irregularities and dismissed on December 21 of the same year. She lived in Munich but then was discharged in February 1944 at Winh√∂ring following the course of the war. =Post-war= At the end of the war, in July 1945, Viermetz was arrested and incarcerated. In January 1946, she was released, first living in Winh√∂ring, and then Munich from December of the same year. In January 1947, she was imprisoned again. She was indicted at the RuSHA Trial. At the trial, which began on 1 July 1947, she was the only woman among the 14 defendants. Viermetz was accused of the abduction of children from abroad. It was justified by the fact that she was a subordinate employee who had acted out of compassion. She was acquitted on 10 March 1948.This article incorporates information from the corresponding article in the French WikipediaThis article incorporates information from the corresponding article in the German Wikipedia She was recognized as denazified by a court in Munich in 1950.Volker Koop: Dem F√ºhrer ein Kind schenken ‚Äì die SS-Organisation \\"Lebensborn\\" e.V., K√∂ln 2007, p. 227ff Nothing is known about her life after this.

Biography Max Speter was born in Beszterce, Austria- Hungary (now Bistri»õa, Romania), the youngest of seven children, to his Jewish parents Johann Speter and Anna Dollberg. He grew up in Bistri»õa and graduated in 1900 from the city's German Gymnasium. Speter began studying engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. He then moved to Hanover, and completed his studies in Munich where he received his Diploma in Mechanical Engineering. After graduating he worked with Oskar von Miller, founder of the Deutsches Museum, as a member of the museum's founding team. For a while he worked in the chemical industry in Germany and Hungary. Then he was hired as a researcher at the Humboldt University of Berlin, where he also started his Ph.D. thesis. His doctoral advisors were Hans Heinrich Landolt and Walther Nernst, who later won the 1920 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Speter acquired his doctorate in 1910. =Under the Nazi regime= From 1934, following the Nazi takeover, it became more and more difficult for Speter to research and publish due to his Jewish ancestry. In 1937 the German radio cancelled a planned broadcast of his public lecture. From 1939 and on he was banned completely from publishing in Germany. Speter committed suicide on 30 June 1942.  Professional activities  =Research and industrial development= While working as a researcher at Humboldt University of Berlin, Speter developed methods for extracting Thorium and Scandium. In 1911 and 1912 he registered patents on these methods. In the same years he operated a laboratory for producing Tungsten paste, then used in the manufacture of Incandescent light bulb filaments. In 1923 and 1925 he registered patents for a disinfecting lamp based on acetaldehyde. In 1927 and 1928 he studied the electrostatic properties of silk, plastic materials and synthetic textiles. The results of these studies were published in a series of articles in several professional journals. = The history of chemistry = In addition to his own activity as a chemist, Speter had a great interest in the study of the history of chemistry. The title of his doctoral dissertation, publish 1910, was \\"Lavoisier and his Forerunners\\" .Lavoisier und seine Vorl√§ufer. Eine historisch-kritische Studie;Max Speter; Ferdinand. Enke, Stuttgart; 1910 Later he studied various areas of chemistry, but his main interests were in the histories of sugar and superphosphate. The history of sugar production. Speter studied the work of the two people who are considered the founding fathers of the production of sugar from sugar beets: Andreas Sigismund Marggraf and Franz Karl Achard. He published a comprehensive bibliography of Franz Karl Achard\`s contributions, including more than 200 references, in the journal of the German sugar industry (\\"Die deutsche Zuckerindustrie\\"). He also published an illustrated account of Achard\`s experiments in beet sugar production. Speter also studied other, less successful, efforts to produce sugar. The famous Justus von Liebig prepared sugar from 7 different species of maple and recommended extensive planting of maples in hope of making Germany self- sufficient in this respect. Another German, Ludwig Hofmann, tried to produce sugar from pumpkin. Speter also studied and wrote about some more esoteric historic experiments with sugar. In 1932 he described the experiments with sugar Triboluminescence made by Francis Bacon and Otto von Guericke. In another publication, he described an anonymous German author who, in 1780, prepared Leyden jars where melted sugar served as an insulator. The history of superphosphate. In his study of the history of Superphosphate Speter collected information, including patents and notes, about 16 scientists and industrialists who contributed to the research and manufacture of the fertilizer. They include: Johann Tholde, a school principal from Brno; Johan Gottlieb Gahn; Carl Wilhelm Scheele; Anders Gustaf Ekeberg; A. Bergsteen; Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin; Antoine Fourcroy; George Pearson; Sir Humphry Davy; S. F. Hernbst√§dt; Justus von Liebig; Sir John Bennet Lawes and Sir James Murray. The results of his studies were published in \\"Super-Phosphate\\", a monthly journal of the International Superphosphate Manufacturers' Association. The papers included detailed bibliographies and biographical notes. The history of the match. As a by-product of his interest in the history of superphosphate he became interested in another Phosphorus product, the match, and its predecessor the tinderbox. In the \\"Deutschen Z√ºndwaren- Zeitung\\", the journal of the German match industry, he published an article about the matches of John Walker called \\"Congreves\\" or \\"friction lights\\". In the same journal he published an illustrated history of matches based on a translation from Hungarian. He also republished an early 19th-century account about tinderboxes, by Friedrich Hermbst√§dt. Other topics in the history of chemistry. Speter studied a variety of other topics in the history of chemistry, among them: plastic materials, explosives, materials for the photographic industry, Scientific instruments and life-saving equipment. The results of his studies were published in German and Austrian scientific and industrial journals. Translations also were printed in publications in the United States, The Netherlands and Hungary. Popular science Beside his scientific publications Speter was an active science popularizer and communicator. As a member of the Deutsches Museum's founding team, he arranged the chemical, physical, and mineralogical exhibits. After leaving this position, he remained an advisor to the museum, consulting about new exhibits. Later on, he used to publish popular humorous and illustrated versions of his works in newspapers and popular science magazines. Between 1924 and 1926 he gave a series of radio lectures.

Biography Antonio C√°novas del Castillo de Rey was born in 1908 in Madrid. He was educated in his home city at the Colegio del Pilar and the University of Madrid before studying in Granada at the El Sacro Monte. In 1936 the Spanish Civil War started and Castillo went to Paris. He spent some time as a diplomat until in 1949 he became a designer for Paquin and Robert Piguet. He also designed accessories for Coco Chanel. Castillo, together with Pierre Balmain, Crist√≥bal Balenciaga, and Christian Dior, were the new generation of Paris designers after World War II. In 1945, Elizabeth Arden persuaded him to join her in New York. He produced collections based on natural shoulder lines and slim silhouettes, topped with small hats, until 1950. Castillo also worked as a costume designer for the New York Metropolitan Opera Company and for Broadway shows. In 1950, Castillo was invited by Jeanne Lanvin's daughter to design for her mother's firm in Paris, with hopes of relaunching the firm's name. In 1950 he joined the fashion house of Lanvin. Lanvin had died in 1946 and the salon needed a new designer. From 1950‚Äì62, the salon was known for elegant clothes, slender lines, long flowing skirts in rich fabrics, and elaborate embroideries.

Life and career Gordon grew up in Newark, New Jersey and attended Newark Arts High School before transferring to Weequahic High School, from which she graduated in 1937. As a teenager, she was an ardent fan of jazz music. In 1942, she married Alfred Lion, co-founder of Blue Note Records. In the 1940s, Gordon and Lion recorded the works of jazz artists such as the clarinetist Sidney Bechet and pianist Thelonious Monk. In 1949, she married Max Gordon, owner of the Village Vanguard club in New York. Established in 1935, the club gained a reputation among jazz musicians in the late 1950s and became a popular place to record live performances. The club's artistic direction was in part guided by her. In the 1960s, as a member of the peace activist group Women Strike for Peace, Gordon rallied against nuclear weapons testing and the Vietnam War. In the 1980s, she worked at the Brooklyn Museum. After Max Gordon's death in 1989, she assumed ownership and management of the Vanguard club. She continued the club's dedication to jazz music and maintained its reputation as a premier jazz club. Gordon's autobiographical memoir, Alive at the Village Vanguard: My Life In and Out of Jazz Time, was published in 2006, and chronicles her lifelong involvement with jazz music. In it she wrote, \\"I didn't arrive at the Village Vanguard from out of the blue. I stuck to what I loved. That was my art. I'm not a musician; I'm not a singer; I'm not a painter; I'm not an actress. I'm none of those things. But throughout my life I followed the course of the music that I loved.\\" The book received the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award for excellence in music print publishing. In 2013, Gordon's contribution to jazz music was recognized by the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts, and she received the NEA Jazz Master Award for jazz advocacy. She actively engaged in the management of Vanguard club until late 2012. She died on June 9, 2018, at age 95.

He was born in Louisville, Kentucky, February 28, 1869, and when but four years old manifested a talent for art. His mother was an artist of the French school, and no doubt it is to her teaching and example that the early development of his artistic temperament is due. The talent was carefully cultivated until the death of the mother, when he was placed under the instruction of H. Clay Woolford, a prominent artist of the south ; but for some reason they were not harmonious, and he made little progress. Two years later Mr. Nadall began studying with Al. Legras, a classmate of the famous Carl Brenner, and from that time he made rapid progress. He afterward went to the Louisville School of Design for a term, and in less than a year he was working for the Louisville daily papers, the Post, the Daily Commercial and others. It was during his connection with the Post that he cartooned the \\"Newman Ward Granite Steal,\\" an expos√© of a swindle on the city, and the result was a suit for damages in the sum of $200,000 against his paper. As a consequence, he left Louisville for Chicago, where he was employed for a time in designing and decorating, and his services were soon sought by printers and publishers. During this period he did good work in designing initials, head and tail pieces, page ornaments and titles, until he finally found congenial work for Barnhart Brothers & Spindler, the Great Western Type Foundry, of Chicago. This proved an incentive to greater exertion and closer study, and he soon determined to go abroad to make a careful study of design in its application to the typefounder's needs. He first went to Birmingham, England, the great industrial center, where every facility is afforded the student, and afterward he spent some months in Paris. Later he returned to Birmingham and applied himself diligently. He went abroad at the end of 1896, and with the exception of a brief visit to Chicago and his old home in the early part of 1899, he has remained continuously at work. Besides devoting a large part of his time to study, he has found employment for the remaining portion in designing type faces and ornaments for English typefounders. In this capacity he has not only had an opportunity to improve his art sense of the best features of the type face to be made, but he has gained a general knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of the typefounding business. Experience of this sort can only be to his ultimate advantage, and must result in reaching the front rank of designers, because it is backed by great energy and persistence. Of Mr. Nadall's productions in England, American printers have not had an opportunity to judge, as there is very little type of English manufacture which finds its way into their offices. He is yet a young man, and really has his reputation to make, but he is bound to make it. The work he did for Barnhart Brothers & Spindler was not extensive, but showed an originality of treatment and a latent talent in letter designing which give promise of better things. For this firm he designed a considerable number of borders and ornaments, all of which have met with a hearty reception from Printers. His principal type designs are Mazarin, Mazarin Italic, Fifteenth Century, Tell Text and a lightface type of pleasing design known as Nadall. This latter was probably cut lighter than the designer intended, and its usefulness thus somewhat impaired, as it has not been found durable at the press. References * William E.

It is located approximately north west of Gundagai, within the Jones Creek district. History Early European settlers in the area originally used the land for grazing livestock. In 1874 while prospecting for gold between Bongongolong and Coolac, a previously unrecorded meteorite was discovered near the village by local man Thomas McMahon. Development in the area around Bongongolong boomed in the late 19th century with the discovery of gold in Bongongolong Creek in 1879. A public school was established in 1880 and by 1889 a stamping battery was in operation. This attracted national media attention when in August, the manager of the mill was committed for trial for his part in the fraudulent sale of impure smelted gold. By the late 1890s, a community hall and post office had been built at Bongongolong. The ongoing decline of the town from World War I onwards is evidenced by the closure of the public school for the last time in 1961. Today little remains of the village, with a few farm houses surviving. The street-grid and foundations for a number of community buildings remain visible. Sometimes the town's name has also been spelled Bongongalong causing some difficulty when reviewing historical documents. In literature The poem \\"Those Names\\" by Banjo Paterson published in 1895 refers to Bongongolong as an example of place names unique to Australia.

The French were repulsed in the fourth of five attempts to consolidate a foothold on the north side of the Sambre. The clash occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of a wider struggle known as the Wars of the French Revolution. In 1794, Lambusart was an independent village, but it is now part of the Fleurus municipality. Lambusart is located about northeast of Charleroi. Three times during the spring of 1794, the French armies attempted to cross the Sambre in the face of resistance by First Coalition forces. The French were turned back at Grandreng on May 13, Erquelinnes on May 24, and Gosselies on June 3. On the last occasion, the French were able to briefly lay siege to the fortress of Charleroi. Meanwhile, Jourdan was detached from the Army of the Moselle with four divisions and moved toward the fighting on the Sambre. After arriving with large reinforcements on June 4, Jourdan assumed control of the Army of the Ardennes and the right wing of the Army of the North. On June 12, the French crossed the Sambre and laid siege to Charleroi for the second time. On the 16th, the Prince of Orange attacked and broke the French right flank, forcing Jourdan to lift the siege and withdraw south of the Sambre. The final showdown along the Sambre would come at the Battle of Fleurus on June 26, 1794.

He began his career with the youth team at Coventry City, before moving to the academy of Birmingham City in 2007. Timmins signed his first professional contract with Birmingham in 2009, ahead of the 2009‚Äì10 season, however he was released from the club at the end of the season without making a first-team appearance. Following his release from Birmingham in 2010, Timmins had a trial at Sheffield United, before joining Redditch United in the Football Conference. He made 20 appearances in all competitions for Redditch in the 2010‚Äì11 season, which saw the club relegated to the Conference South.

He then moved to Victoria in 2013, to play for Green Gully SC in the Victorian Premier League, with the intention of playing in a league at a higher standard. While playing for Green Gully, Timmins's team-mate Rodrigo Vargas, a former A-League veteran, contacted his former manager at Melbourne Victory and the incumbent Wellington Phoenix manager Ernie Merrick, to inform Merrick of Timmins's impressive performances in the VPL. As a result, Timmins began training with Wellington Phoenix in 2014, however could not play for the side as they had no remaining visa positions.

A former U.S. citizen born and raised in New York, he moved to Kiev permanently in 1991, and renounced U.S. citizenship in 1997 to become a Ukrainian citizen. In Kiev, he worked with the People's Movement of Ukraine and founded the Institute of Statehood and Democracy, while also supporting himself by doing consulting work for foreign firms. Career In the late 1980s, Lozowy worked as a legal advisor to future mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani. In 1990, Lozowy was working as a research assistant at the Heritage Foundation when he made his first trip to Ukraine. The following year, he met Mykhailo Horyn of the People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh) when the latter was visiting Washington, D.C.; Horyn gave a lecture about Ukrainian independence at The Heritage Foundation's invitation, and Lozowy asked Horyn if he could come to Ukraine and work for Rukh directly. At that time, Lozowy admits he did not speak the Ukrainian language very well. He founded the Institute of Statehood and Democracy (ISD), a public policy NGO, in 1996 with the assistance of Rukh. After Rukh's having split up in 1999, he continued working for the ISD, though by 2006 it had downsized from its peak of six employees to just Lozowy and two others in a one-room office. He also did consulting work for various firms including AI Information Network and Amber Global Consulting. He also worked at the State Committee in Television and Radio-broadcasting in 2000‚Äì2001. In 2013, Lozowy founded the organisation Anti-Tabachnyk, aimed at achieving the resignation of Minister of Education Dmytro Tabachnyk. He stated that he was motivated to start the group after seeing the revised history textbooks being used by his two children at their school. In protests held in November that year in the prelude to the Euromaidan, Lozowy accused Tabachnyk of favouring the Russian language over Ukrainian, ignoring the Holodomor and Ukrainian national heroes, promoting a pro-Soviet point of view, and wasting money on low-quality textbooks. After the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, Lozowy condemned Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Oleksandr Turchynov for his veto of a bill which would have repealed earlier legislation on languages in Ukraine and made Ukrainian the sole official language at all levels. In April 2014, after returning from a visit to Kharkiv and Luhansk, he further criticised Turchynov's response to the unrest in eastern Ukraine, and stated that \\"we're losing eastern Ukraine and we're sort of really maybe even past the point of no return\\". In the summer of 2014 Lozowy fought with the Aidar battalion against the Russian incursion into eastern Ukraine in the Luhansk oblast and went on a mission to Krasniy Yar, in the outskirts of the city of Luhansk, on August 3, 2014. Thereafter he created the \\"Friends of the Aidar Battalion\\" group on Facebook and assisted the battalion doing volunteer work and with equipment. Personal life Lozowy was born in 1961 in New York City to parents Ivan Hryhorovych (1927‚Äì1983) and Liudmilla Elizabetivna (born 1936). He grew up in New York, where his mother still lives, and went on to attend the New York University School of Law, graduating in 1986. The following year he went on to study international law at the Panth√©on-Assas University in Paris. He is married to Olena, a schoolteacher, with whom he has two children, Oleksandra and Lyudmila. Soon after moving to Ukraine, Lozowy decided that he wanted to settle there permanently, and began researching the procedure to obtain Ukrainian citizenship. He swore the Oath of Renunciation of United States Citizenship in 1997. Lozowy's choice made him one of the first former Ukrainian Americans, along with Roman Zvarych, to renounce U.S. citizenship in favour of Ukrainian citizenship. In interviews, Lozowy has stated that he is proud of his citizenship, because it helped him to feel closer to the people of Ukraine and to fight against \\"the anti-national activities of the government\\".

Farnham typically calls games featuring the Southeastern Conference as part of ESPN's Super Tuesday and Thursday Night Showcase packages, while he has previously called games for the Big Ten Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Western Athletic Conference, West Coast Conference Pac-12 Conference and the Big 12 Conference. Before joining ESPN, Farnham worked for CBS Sports Network, then known as CSTV and CBS College Sports, calling games from the Mountain West Conference, the Atlantic 10 Conference, and Conference USA. He has also called Pac-12 games for Fox Sports West. Early life Farnham was born in Walnut Creek, California. He grew up in Clayton, California and attended De La Salle High School, where he played basketball. Farnham was a member of the powerful AAU program the Oakland Soldiers, it was on this team that Sean gained attention for his play at the BCI event in Phoenix where he was named BCI All-American in July 1993. He led De La Salle to their first ever Nor Cal championship his senior year (1996) where they face Crenshaw in the D-1 State final. After high school, Farnham would play for the UCLA Bruins from 1997-2000. College career Farnham entered UCLA as a walk-on so he could play for a national title contender rather accept an athletic scholarship and be a star player at another university. With hard work and determination he earned a full ride scholarship. On a year-to-year scholarship, Farnham's funding was cut off in his junior year in 1998‚Äì99 as UCLA coach Steve Lavin used it to secure one of the best recruiting classes in the nation. In that season's Pac-10 conference (later known as the Pac-12) opener against No. 6 Arizona, Farnham received his first career start after JaRon Rush had been suspended, and Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric were benched for not practicing earlier in the week. Farnham left the game after four minutes with UCLA ahead 13‚Äì4, and the Bruins won 82‚Äì75 over the previously undefeated Wildcats. Farnham regained his scholarship as a senior in 1999‚Äì2000.

After the game Fox Sports West approached Farnham and offered him an unpaid position that wouldn't violate NCAA rules but would allow Farnham to deliver insights on players at UCLA and across the Pac-12 Conference. Farnham took the position and remained doing these profiles until his graduation in 2000. During his senior season, Farnham would play in 23 games, start in 11, and average 1.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists. During his career, UCLA had a 19‚Äì2 record with Farnham as a starter.

Farnham would work alongside Jan van Breda Kolff. Despite an impressive record of 22-9, his tenure in coaching lasted only one season. Van Breda Kolff would be hired as the head coach at Saint Bonaventure University, and Farnham found himself with two choices: head east, or find a new job in the West. Sean called up his old friends at Fox Sports West, and his broadcasting career began. Farnham would initially start with athlete profiles, but he would work his way up to high school analyst and then college basketball analyst. During his 10-year broadcast career at Fox Sports West, Farnham would win two Los Angeles based broadcast emmys, cover the Lakers, Clippers, Angels and Dodgers as well.

He is known for his work in nuclear physics, particle physics and quantum field theory and in particular, for his fundamental contributions in obtaining the exact solution of the nucleon 3- body problem with separable potentials which led to the few nucleon studies, quark-recoil effect, development of an integrated dynamics of 2- and 3- body systems from nucleons to quarks as well as for the development of quark dynamics and relativistic quark models for hadrons in the Bethe-Salpeter framework. He was awarded the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize in 1969. Early life Asoke Nath Mitra was born on 15 April 1929, in Rajshahi, now in Bangladesh, to Jatindra Nath and Rama Rani Mitra. His father, Jatindra Nath Mitra, taught mathematics in Ramjas College, Delhi University. Mitra too went to Ramjas College to study mathematics, obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1947 and M.A. in 1949. He started his work in physics in 1949, as a Ph.D. student working with R. C. Majumdar Academic career After his Ph.D., Mitra went to Cornell University, where he completed a second Ph.D., working with Freeman J. Dyson and Hans Bethe. Mitra returned to India in 1955, and was appointed Reader at Aligarh Muslim University. He moved to Delhi University as professor in 1963, where he remained until his superannuation in 1994. Mitra was head of the Department of Physics and Astrophysics during 1973-75, but stepped down without completing his three-year term. He held visiting appointments at Indiana University (1962‚Äì63) and at the University of Illinois at Chicago (1986‚Äì87). He held the prestigious chair of INSA: INSA-Albert Einstein Research Professor during 1989-94 at the University of Delhi.\\\\- INSA Profile Presently he is a life-time emeritus professor of the university of Delhi at its department of physics and astrophysics. He has produced a large number of PhD's who are now occupying leading academic positions the world over. Scientific Research Mitra has made several original research contributions in the field of nuclear and particle physics. His prominent contributions include: (i) exact solution of the nuclear 3-body problem with separable potentials which offered a new insight into the structure of the 3-body wave function leading to \\"few-nucleon studies\\" as a new branch of physics (ii) a node in the proton electro magnetic form factor unless fermion quarks have an extra d.o.f. a forerunner for the discovery of \\"color\\" and (iii) the \\"quark-recoil effect\\" (in association with Marc Ross), for the understanding of enhanced heavy meson modes of decay. He has developed a comprehensive dynamical framework leading to an integrated view of the dynamics of 2- and 3- body systems at successively deeper levels of compositeness, from nuclear to sub-hadronic with a formulational style designed to bridge the traditional gap between theoretical sophistication and empirical fits to data.,\\\\- Publications Profile on INSPIRE-HEP In the eighties he developed a powerful Bethe-Salpeter approach for the relativistic quark models and studied successfully (in collaborations with others) the meson and baryon dynamics and spectrum.,,Daya Shankar Kulshreshtha, Asoke Nath Mitra, Phys.

Founded in 1986, its initial research focus on HIV/AIDS has expanded over time to include viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections and a range of other infectious diseases. The institute's inaugural director was Professor David A. Cooper. History =National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research (1986‚Äì2011)= The National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research (NCHECR) was founded in 1986 in response to the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic in Australia. Start-up funding was provided by the Australian federal government with the goal of reducing the national burden of the epidemic. The centre was later supported by ongoing funding from the federal government, the New South Wales state government and the University of New South Wales, in addition to one-off grants from, among others, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Atlantic Philanthropies. =Kirby Institute (2011‚Äìpresent)= In April 2011, on the organisation's 25th anniversary, the NCHECR was renamed the Kirby Institute for infection and immunity in society, with a new focus on behavioural-related infectious diseases affecting \\"marginalised, disempowered and other communities\\". The new name was taken in honour of Michael Kirby, a former Justice of the High Court of Australia and an outspoken supporter of human rights, health promotion, and HIV/AIDS research. In 2013, Kirby accepted the role of Patron of the institute. In 2018 the Kirby Institute employed and supported approximately 350 researchers and students and is operating research studies in Australia and worldwide. Outside of Australia, the Institute is engaged in disease prevention in countries including Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.

The subject matter, its cast, and its long running popularity on cable television are seen as an odd mix. The series premiered in 2011 and has two seasons every year, for a total of 17 through August 2020. (only accessible from the United States or its territories)  Cast  Diane and Jan Pol in 2019 *Jan Pol (born on 4 September 1942, in Wateren, Netherlands), studied veterinary medicine at Utrecht University, graduating in 1970. Moved with his wife Diane to Harbor Beach, Michigan, and Pol worked for a veterinarian for more than 10 years. They then moved to Weidman, Michigan, where they started their own practice, Pol Veterinary Services, out of their home in 1981.Meet Dr.Pol - website Santee School District (pdf) His practice has transformed from large animals to a mix with small animals. Because of the unavailability of emergency care animal hospitals in this rural area, emergencies make up a large portion of the practice. He claims to have served more than 19,000 clients in his many years of practice. Dr. Pol says that despite his advancing years, he can't retire: there are not veterinarians stepping into the breach to take care of farm animals. *Diane Pol (born in Mayville, Michigan, in 1943), met Jan Pol when he was a foreign exchange student at Mayville High School in 1961. She has a master's degree in Special Reading and used to be a teacher at Harbor Beach Elementary School.

Emily left the practice (and the show) in 2019. She relocated with her family to take a job in Virginia. Production Filming The Incredible Dr. Pol in 2019 Pol is surprised that the show became a hit \\"watched by everybody‚Äîall kinds of life, all ages, big family show, and I think this is what is so fantastic.‚Äù He credits his son Charles, who is the series producer, and who successfully pitched the series to National Geographic. According to Pol, Charles counseled him, ‚ÄúDad, do your work. That is interesting enough. Don‚Äôt look at the camera, don‚Äôt do anything for the camera.‚Äù Pol continues. \\"... it‚Äôs not scripted; it is real‚Äù Viewer's complaint and legal fall-out Pol's performance has received a mixed reception by veterinarians. In 2012, a disciplinary board placed Dr. Pol on probation for negligence and incompetence for his treatment and care of a Boston terrier that was hit by a car and suffered an eye proptosis and broken pelvis in May 2011 where the owners of the dog were happy with the care it had been given but Pol's treatment of a dog, as depicted on the show, spawned the complaint from a veterinarian viewer, not the pet's owner. In 2013, Michigan Speaker of the House Kevin Cotter sponsored House Bill 5176, seeking to prohibit authorities from investigating reports of misconduct or allegations ‚Äúbased upon information obtained from viewing the broadcast of a reality program.‚Äù Dr. Pol testified in favor of the bill. It was referred to the House Health Policy Committee in December 2013, died in committee, and has not been re-introduced. In April 2015, government regulators in Michigan found Pol in violation for his treatment and care of the Boston terrier that was treated in May 2011 where the original complaint had been placed by a veterinarian viewer, not the pet's owner.. A disciplinary subcommittee of the Michigan Board of Veterinary Medicine had decided on 26th March to fine Dr. Pol $500 and put his license on probation for not complying with standards of care required by the state. Pol was also ordered to complete an educational course. His sentencing was overturned, however, by the Michigan Court of Appeals, which stated that ‚Äúthe owners of the dog were happy with the care it has been given‚Äù and called the previous decision by the subcommittee \\"arbitrary and capricious\\". In 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding inter alia that there was no competent evidence that there was a breach of the standard of care. There were supporters of the ruling based on notions of elemental due process, including vagueness of the charge, lack of an objective and clear legal standard, and variance of the evidence presented from the charges lodged. At this juncture, a spokesman from Mackinac Center for Public Policy opined that consumers and the market place, not an officious government, should be able to make care decisions for their animals. However, in late 2019 after remand, the Michigan Court of Appeals in another unpublished decision, wrote an extended opinion which affirmed the lower decisions that imposed the discipline.

After an apprenticeship to a local engraver, he enrolled at the Accademia of Florence in 1856, where he studied under Antonio Ciseri.Steingr√§ber & Matteucci 1984, p. 114. As part of his training he made copies of the works of quattrocento artists such as Masaccio and Botticelli.Broude 1987, p. 78.

In 1859 he began frequenting the Caff√® Michelangiolo and met the artists of the Macchiaioli, including Odoardo Borrani, who became a close friend. Sernesi served as a volunteer in the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859. Upon his return to Florence later that year, he made his first plein air landscape paintings.Broude 1987, p. 79. Norma Broude says these works are characterized by \\"the azure and terracotta hues typical both of Tuscany's landscape and its fresco tradition\\" and says they reveal \\"a taste for rectilinear clarity in spatial and compositional organization\\". Sernesi exhibited his painting Pastura in montagna (\\"Mountain Pastures\\") at the Brera National Exhibition in 1861 and at the Florentine Promotrice in 1862. In 1862 he traveled to Naples and later to Ischia. He exhibited two paintings at the Milan exhibition in 1865. In 1866 he joined Garibaldi's campaign in the Third Italian War of Independence. On July 16 he suffered a serious wound to the leg and was taken prisoner by the Austrians. He was taken to Bolzano for treatment, but his reluctance to have his leg amputated led to his death from gangrene on August 9, 1866. Notes References *Broude, Norma (1987).

The Prince was redesigned for 1926 with a separate gearbox and a fuel tank similar in shape to that of the contemporary Scout. Both versions used coil-sprung girder forks instead of the leaf-sprung trailing link forks used on the contemporary Chief and Scout. A front brake was added in 1928, the last year of production.

His Offer Longitudinal Study was one of the first studies of typical youth over time and demonstrated that most pass through adolescence adequately happy and connected to families and others. This contribution shifted fundamentally how adolescent development was understood scientifically and provoked recognition that theory from patient populations was inadequate. He is also remembered for his scholarship on normality, the viability of memory, the Offer Self Image Questionnaire and for fostering the field of adolescent developmental studies.  Biography  Daniel Offer was born in Berlin, Germany on December 24, 1929. He is the son of Walter Hirsch, M.D. a pediatrician, and Ilse Hirsch, n√©e Meyer. He is a grandson of Professor Ludwig Ferdinand Meyer, M.D., a pediatric gastroenterologist and Director of the Emperor and Empress Friedrich Children‚Äôs Hospital in Berlin, Germany. After the rise of Nazism in April 1933, both his father and his grandfather lost their jobs. The two families immigrated to Palestine in 1936. Offer grew up in Jerusalem and, in February, 1948, he joined the Palmach (Strike Force) of the Israeli army. At that time he changed his name from Thomas Edgar Hirsch to Daniel Offer. He left the Israel Defense Forces as a Staff Sergeant in 1950. He then attended the University of Rochester, in Rochester, New York. He continued his education at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, graduating in 1957. Offer served an internship at the University of Illinois Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois followed by a psychiatric residency at Michael Reese Hospital, Chicago, Illinois (1958 to 1961). He remained at Michael Reese until 1990. During that time he was Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry from 1977 to 1987. From 1973 to 1990 he served on the faculty of the University of Chicago Medical School, becoming Professor of Psychiatry in 1974. In 1990 he became Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, attaining emeritus status in 2008. Offer was married to Judith Baskin Offer from 1961 until her death in 1976. In 1979 he married Marjorie Kaiz Offer. They were married until his death in 2013. He has three children and six grandchildren. = Life on dialysis = In June, 1999 Daniel Offer began dialysis due to renal failure. In order to help fellow renal patients navigate the world of dialysis, he wrote with his wife, Marjorie Kaiz Offer and his daughter Susan Offer Szafir a guide to dealing with dialysis. The bookOffer, D., Offer, M. Kaiz, Szafir, S. Offer. 2007. Dialysis Without Fear. Oxford University Press; New York. incorporates interviews with nephrologists, nurses, social workers, dieticians, technicians and dialysis patients and their families.  Career  = Adolescent psychiatry =  The Offer longitudinal study  In 1963 Offer realized that very little was known about the development of normal (i.e. non-patient) adolescents. He received eight years of federal grants to study the psychological development of normal adolescents. In the first phase of the study seventy three boys were selected from two suburban Chicago area high school and followed for eight years. The major finding for the high school phase was that stability and not turmoil, was the overriding characteristic of normal adolescents. This finding contradicted the then current notion of normal development. At that time it was believed that all adolescents go through major turmoil as they move through the high school years. The four years of the post high school phase of the school substantiated this finding. Two books resulted from the adolescent phase of the study.Offer, D. 1969. The Psychological World of the Teenager: A Study of Normal Adolescent Boys. New York: Basic Books, Inc.Offer, D. and Offer, J.L. 1975. From Teenage to Young Manhood: A Psychological Study. New York: Basic Books, Inc. In 1996-7 94% of the original sample were reinterviewed. They were now 48. The original finding held. All were well adjusted late middle-aged individuals. The major finding was the discovery that well-adjusted adults do not remember their adolescence accurately. The data showed that there is essentially no correlation between what the subjects as adults thought and felt about their adolescence and what they actually thought and felt when they were adolescents. This phase of the study was covered in the book \\"Regular Guys\\".Offer, D., Offer, M. K. and Ostov, E. 2004. Regular Guys, 34 Years Beyond Adolescence, Springer, New York: 2004.  The Offer Self-Image Questionnaire (OSIQ)  The OSIQ is a psychological testOffer, D., Ostrov, E., Howard, K.I., and Dolan, S. 1992. The Offer Self- Image Questionnaire for Adolescents (OSIQ): A Manual, Completely Revised Fifth Edition. Los Angeles: Western Psychological Services. developed in 1962 which uses 129 items and twelve scales to assess teenager‚Äôs adjustment in areas such as impulse control, emotional well-being, peer relationships, family relationships, coping ability and sexuality. Over the years the OSIQ became a popular psychological test used in many countries throughout the world. It has been translated into twenty-six languages. Because of this interest, Offer and his colleagues undertook a cross cultural study of the self-image of adolescents in ten countries. The major finding was that adolescents growing up in very different countries are, on the whole, more similar to one another than they are different. However, there were some important differences in their psychological makeup.Offer, D., Ostrov, E. Howard, R. I. and Atkinson, R. 1988. The Teenage World: Adolescents' Self-Image in Ten Countries.

The bank of OSIQ data generated by 30,000 adolescents, both normal and psychiatrically disturbed or delinquent, as well as all the data from the Offer Longitudinal Study has been placed in the Daniel Offer and Marjorie Kaiz Offer Archives at the Institute for Juvenile Research, Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois Medical School, Chicago Illinois.  Deviant and disturbed adolescents  Offer undertook a five year study, 1969 -1974, of psychiatrically disturbed juvenile delinquents.Offer, D. Marohn, R. C. and Ostrov, E. 1979. The Psychological World of the Juvenile Delinquent. New York: Basic Books, Inc. This was an empirical study to analyze the makeup of this population and how society can best help them. The authors were in charge of an inpatient unit for this population at the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute, a setting which allowed for an in depth study. In the early 1990s Holinger, Offer and colleagues examined the rates of suicide and homicide among adolescents in order to determine the causes and suggest means of prevention.Holinger, P.C., Offer, D., Barter, J.T. and Bell, C.C. 1994. Suicide and Homicide Among Adolescents. New York: Guilford Press.  The Journal of Youth and Adolescence  In 1972 Offer founded The Journal of Youth and Adolescence. He served it as editor-in-chief from 1972 to 2006, at which time he became Editor Emeritus. = The study of normality = During the beginning of the Offer Longitudinal Study, Offer became interested in how mental health professionals defined normality. Working with Melvin Sabshin, they defined the four perspectives of what constitutes normal behavior. They are: normality as health, as utopia, as average and as process.Offer, D., and Sabshin, M. 1966. Normality: Theoretical and Clinical Concepts of Mental Health. New York: Basic Books, Inc.Offer, D., and Sabshin, M. 1974. Normality: Theoretical and Clinical Concepts of Mental Health (Second Edition). New York: Basic Books, Inc. (Revised Edition) To broaden knowledge of what constitutes normal behavior, Offer and Sabshin with colleagues looked at normality throughout life as well as normality in different settings.Offer, D., and Sabshin, M. (eds.). 1984. Normality and the Life Cycle: A Critical Integration. New York: Basic Books, Inc.Offer, D., and Sabshin, M. (eds.). (1991). The Diversity of Normality. New York: Basic Books, Inc. = The study of leadership = In the 1980s Offer pursued his interest in the psychological aspects of leadership by editing a book with Charles B. Strozier.Strozier, C.B., and Offer, D. (eds.). 1985. The Leader: Psychohistorical Essays. New York: Plenum Press. Together they organized a collection of essays, addressing the protean nature of political leadership, tracing the history of the psychological study of leadership from ancient formulations in the Bible to the most recent and progressive psychoanalytic works. A second revised edition was published in 2011.Strozier, C.B., Offer, D. and Abdyli, Oliger (eds.). 2011. The Leader: Psychological Essays. New York: Springer  Awards and honors  Offer was recognized at a Symposium in his honor given by the Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois Medical School, Chicago, Illinois. A Festschrift in his honor was published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence, Part I: Vol. 36, No. 1:January 2007, and Part II, Vol. 37, No. 10, November, 2008. He was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Palo Alto California, 1973-1974. Offer has been recognized by many medical and scientific organizations. Among the honors he has received are the John P. Hill Memorial AwardJohn P.

It originally aired on October 7, 2010. The episode was written by Mike Daniels and directed by Jeff Woolnough. Plot The episode starts with a flashback from a year ago where Mason (Taylor Kinney) is at a bar and when he leaves, a man named Jimmy follows him. Jimmy accuses Mason of hitting on his girlfriend and the two of them start to fight. During the fight, Jimmy hits his head and dies and Mason has triggered the werewolf curse. Back to the present, Mason warns Tyler (Michael Trevino) that any death that comes from his hands, even if it's an accident, it will trigger the curse and he has to be careful. Mason asks for the moonstone now that he told Tyler everything and Tyler takes him to his father's secret safe but the moonstone is not there. Tyler does not tell Mason that he already found it. Elena (Nina Dobrev) tells Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) about the Lockwoods because she promised not to hide anything from him anymore but she asks him to not get involved. When Jeremy leaves, Stefan (Paul Wesley) appears in Elena's room and they plan their fight of the day so Katherine keeps believing that they are not together. Liz (Marguerite MacIntyre) gets ready for the Mystic Falls' Historical Society Volunteer Day and wants to spend some time with Caroline (Candice Accola). Liz senses that there is something different about Caroline the past few days but Caroline says she is fine and leaves. Stefan approaches Mason to apologize on Damon's (Ian Somerhalder) behalf for trying to kill him and to offer a truce, but Mason declines. Stefan insists and \\"threatens\\" Mason, who finally shakes hands with Stefan. Damon rejoins Stefan to ask what he was doing with Mason and says that despite the truce, Damon still wants to kill him. Stefan also admits that he does not trust Mason and that he will try to kill them in the first chance he gets. Meanwhile, Mason wants to expose the Salvatore brothers and he tells Liz about them. Liz does not believe him and Mason offers to prove it to her. In the meantime, Jeremy is at the Grill and sees Tyler from afar. He approaches him and they start to talk when Aimee (Tiya Sircar) and Sarah (Maiara Walsh) rejoin them. Tyler wants to relax a little from everything that is happening, so he invites all three of them at his house to have some drinks. At the house, the girls want to see Jeremy's drawings and Tyler gets upset when he sees that Jeremy draws wolves. He asks him to go with him at the office to show him something and when they are alone he demands to know why he keeps drawing wolves. Jeremy admits to him that he knows what he is and Tyler tells him about the curse and the moonstone that his uncle is desperately looking for. The two of them get interrupted by the girls and Sarah takes the moonstone. Tyler tries to get it back and as they \\"fight\\", Sarah falls down the stairs. Tyler looks horrified thinking that he has killed her and triggered the curse when Sarah wakes up. Back at the park, Elena and Stefan pretend to have another fight so that Caroline can report to Katherine. Meanwhile, Liz watches Damon from afar as he is drinking a lemonade that is full of vervain and he chokes, knowing now that Mason was telling the truth. She frantically calls the Council to arrange an ambush for the Salvatore brothers but Caroline sees her from afar leaving the park and she confronts her for leaving \\"their\\" day once more for work. Stefan and Damon decide to kill Mason and they follow him to the woods, without knowing that it's a trap. Liz arrives with two deputies and shoot them in the chest. They carry them down to the old Lockwood slave quarters where Liz asks Mason to leave because he is not part of the Council and he can't be there after she promises that she will kill the Salvatores. On his way out, he runs into Elena and Caroline who are tracking down Damon and Stefan. He threatens to kill Elena but Caroline manages to knock him out so, the two of them leave to get to Stefan and Damon. Caroline and Elena get at the entrance of the crypt when Caroline stops realizing that if she gets in to save the Salvatores, her mother will find out that she is a vampire. Elena gets in and tells Liz that she can't kill them when Caroline changes her mind and comes to help. She bites the two deputies while Liz is watching in shock. Damon feeds on the deputies and get his strength back, Stefan refuses to drink human blood and Liz sits in silence. Caroline begs her to keep their secret otherwise Damon will kill her. Liz asks to be killed but Damon does not do it because she is his friend and they take her at the Salvatore house to lock her at the basement till her system is vervain-free and they will be able to compel her. Meanwhile, Stefan gets to Damon's blood bag stash and when Elena asks him what he is doing, he explains that if he drinks human blood in small doses he might be able to control it. His diet makes him weak and despite the fact that he could die earlier, he also cannot protect Elena from Katherine. Elena is horrified by his words and leaves to find Caroline. Caroline confesses to Elena that Katherine made her spy on her and Stefan and report back to her, otherwise she would kill Matt (Zach Roerig). Caroline falls asleep and Elena, on her way out, runs into Damon who tells her that Stefan did not drink the human blood. Elena gets back inside and goes to Stefan telling him that if he wants to try again on human blood, she wants to be there for him. She cuts her hand offering him her blood and Stefan drinks a few drops hungrily before they kiss. Mason gets back home and tries to contact Liz to ask her if everything is fine when Tyler gets in and confesses him that he almost killed someone earlier. Tyler says that his wolf nature wished for a moment that Sarah had died and because he does not want to feel that again, he gives him the moonstone. The episode ends with Mason meeting Katherine at her car in the woods. Another flashback takes us back to when Mason killed Jimmy and Katherine appears to console him. Her look when he hugs her reveals that she was behind everything and she was the one who made Jimmy attack Mason so Mason would kill him and trigger the curse. Back in the present, Mason gives the moonstone to Katherine and they start kissing.

Emma Fraser of TV Overmind gave an A+ rate to the episode saying that it deserves a hearty round of applause for such excellent story telling. \\"Tyler in the end gives up the moonstone to Mason and despite not finding out what it does, finding out who wanted it was a shocking and unexpected twist; Katherine! It really shouldn't be that shocking considering that we know that Katherine is capable of anything and was the one who gave up the stone back in 1864. What she wants with it is unknown but to see that she is romantically entangled with Mason and was the one who provoked the bar fight that led to Mason's transformation was a surprising and welcome move.\\" Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 4/4 saying that it was a satisfying episode that successfully blended the story action and character interaction. \\"Although this episode is relatively free of major plot developments‚Äîno one dies, for instance‚Äîevents are still moving quickly through the episodes. The rapid pace of the plot, however, doesn't create the sense that the story is rushed, because of episodes like this one, which, as a whole, successfully balances action with emotional conflict. It moves the plot while focusing on the characters and their relationships.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.9/5 saying that he didn't see coming Katherine being involved with Mason. \\"Throughout the episode, I was impressed by how the show had depicted Mason as neither good nor evil. Even when he plotted to help kill Stefan and Damon, it was out of self defense, not pure malevolence. But now there's no doubt about what side he's on.\\" Reagan from The TV Chick gave an A- rate to the episode saying that it was another excellent one while Meg from Two Cents TV also gives a good review to the episode saying that the show isn't afraid to break with tradition or spill some secrets; \\"With \\"Kill Or Be Killed,\\" the show deftly sidesteps some clich√©s and hands us an episode of fun, twisty reveals.\\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying: \\"The twist ending this episode is completely unexpected as we learn that the two storylines of Mason looking for the moonstone and Katherine returning to Mystic Falls are connected. There was a hint of this last week when we saw Katherine in a flashback with the moonstone, but the revelation that she is pulling the strings on Mason is a surprise, and a good one. Devious as she is, we see that she was even the reason behind him becoming a werewolf.\\" Josie Kafka of Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3.5/4 saying that the episode was about friendships and about the ending she wrote: \\"I figured out that the guy who tried to beat up Mason was acting under compulsion as it was happening, and it was just a short logical leap to suspecting Katherine was behind it. I didn't expect that she was looking for the moonstone, though.\\" Shannon Vestal from Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that Caroline and Mason had the spotlight on them this week and they each do a lot with their time.

With Steaua Bucharest he won the national championship six times. In the 1960s he was considered to be the best right wing player in the world. His speciality were fast breaks and goal area passes to the pivot or the left winger. In 45 national team games he scored 121 goals.  Player  = Youth years = Josef Jakob began playing field handball when he was in sixth grade. In 1955 he interrupted his high school education when he was asked to join Electromotor Timi»ôoara. The team merged with Progresul Timi»ôoara the same year, and they placed second after CFR Timi»ôoara in the regional league. = Top league = In 1957 Jakob transferred to top-league team Tehnometal Timi»ôoara, where he had Adam Fischer as coach. While playing there, he was called up for the first time to the national youth team, where he made his debut in a match in Poland. Jakob played three more years field handball for Tehnometal. In 1962 he was asked by Steaua Bucharest to play in the Spartakiad for military teams. Between 1964 and 1966 he became twice national vicechampion with Steaua. In 1968, Jakob won with Steaua the EHF Champions League in Frankfurt am Main against HC Dukla Prague. In the same year, he and Gheorghe Gruia were selected for the world team. Between 1968 and 1971 Steaua won the national championship four times in a row. = National team player = In 1962 he was called up for the first time to the national team.

It was developed in 1932 by the OKB-5 design bureau at Bolshevik Plant no. 232 under the direction of a German engineer-designer Edward Grote. Development did not advance past the stage of construction drawings and scale models. The design was passed over in favour of the T-35 project which was already at the prototype stage. History From the late 1920s to early 1930s, the military-political situation in the Soviet Union demanded emergency measures for the modernization of the army. The implementation of the 1929 program by the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) was designed to equip the armed forces with improved tanks. Most Red Army armor at the time consisted of relatively modern light infantry support tanks like the T-18 (MS-1), and the role of medium and heavy tanks was fulfilled mainly by British tanks that were captured in the Russian Civil War. Work began to create indigenous medium and heavy tanks, but it quickly became apparent that the USSR lacked the necessary scientific base and experience for tank design. After several unsuccessful attempts to develop an all-domestic tank design (such as the T-30), it was decided that the Army would attract professionals from abroad, primarily from Germany. In March 1930 a group of experts from Germany - headed by engineer Edward Grote - arrived by invitation in the USSR. The group was commissioned to draft future tanks to arm the Red Army. Grote's first job was \\"a powerful medium tank\\", designated \\"TG\\", which had an overall level of engineering ahead of its time. The tank made a very favorable impression on the leadership of the Red Army, but the high complexity of its design caused it to remain a purely experimental development. However, this did not discourage Grote, and the OKB started designing a heavy tank. Being a talented engineer, Grote had impressive experience in designing tanks and at the beginning of the 1930s the Soviet Union was one of the few countries that was able to finance the design and construction of these machines. By March 1932 the German engineer presented the military draft of a heavy breakthrough tank weighing 75 tons, conventionally called the TG-VI. This development did not receive special support from UMM RKKA, resulting in Grote reworking it into a new project tank called the T-42 (or TG-V). It was even more impressive than its predecessor and weighed 100 tonnes. In the summer of 1932 the new project was considered by the military and, like its predecessor, met with little success. By this time the UMM RKKA already had a choice of the T-35 as a heavy tank, which was superior to Grote's design. The engine the T-42 needed did not actually exist, and the problem of powering the massive vehicle was not solved. The speed and maneuverability of the tank were questioned and high price noted. As a result, the UMM RKKA Commission decided that the T-42 was not fully consistent with the presented design goals and decided to end work on the project, focusing instead on the T-35. Design The layout of the T-42 was similar to the T-35 (a prototype of which (the T-35-1) was based on the work of the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory) with five turrets: one turret with a 107 mm M1910/30 field gun, two BT-2 tank turrets with 45 mm M1932/38 (20K)s, and two turrets with 7.62 mm DTM machine guns. Like its predecessor, the TG-IV, the T-42 had two tiers, with the main gun on the upper tier and the secondary weapons on the lower tier. The control compartment was at the front. To ensure an acceptable view from the driver's seat, the driver's compartment was placed along the axis of the tank, and its position was pushed forward and equipped with an armored superstructure. A variety of weapons were housed in five towers arranged in two tiers. The first layer was formed by four towers placed around the main turret. Installed in front of the two cannon towers were turrets armed with 45 mm M1932/38 (20K) tank gun, and paired with 7.62-mm machine- guns. Finally, there was a rear turret equipped with twin DT machine guns to perform anti-air duties. The second tier contained the main turret, which was adapted for the installation of the M1910/30. On the roof of the main tower there was also a small cupola for the commander. Detailed design of the tank weapons was not in the scope of the project, and the documentation only showed how the weapons would be laid out. There was also a design in which the placement of weapons was in three towers, of which there would be a turret with a 76.2 mm gun (traverse 202 ¬∞) at the front, a turret with the regular 45 mm gun (angle GN 278 ¬∞) at the back, and the main 107 mm gun (GN 270 ¬∞ angle ) in the centre. The power compartment was housed in the rear of the hull. Even with a large engine installed, it is likely there would not have been enough power to move the 100-ton machine easily. To ensure the tank met the speed required by the Red Army UMM, the T-42 needed about 2,000 horsepower. Since in 1932 there was no such single engine capable of producing 2,000 hp, installation of two diesel engines, each producing 1000 hp, would have been necessary. The tank suspension was composed of 17 twin small diameter rollers, an idler at the front, and rear driving sprocket. The 1st and 17th road wheels had individual suspension, the three middle rollers connected to the common carriage, and the remaining pairs were in 6 bogies. To facilitate the management of the tank, as in the case of TG, Grote decided to apply an electric transmission and servo control that, although increasing the ergonomics of the tank, further complicated the suspension and raised its cost. It was assumed that the tank would have different armor levels on each facing, with a maximum thickness of the frontal parts of the hull and turrets of 90 mm. Analysis Like most super-heavy tanks developed in the 1920s-1930s around the world, the T-42 had almost no practical utility. The sheer size and weight of such a tank made it a perfect target, despite anti- air measures, and the movement characteristics of the tank were also in doubt. In addition, there was the problem of delivering tanks of this size and weight to the front line and into combat (for example, moving such a heavy machine over bridges or creating a rail car that could carry it). For these reasons and the prohibitive cost, even with very powerful weapons, the T-42 could not play a decisive role in battle. Thus, the tank was inferior to the T-35, which was eventually selected by the USSR for adoption.

At the age of only three years the first turns on skis were carved into the snow. The local ski club (SV Tr√∂polach in the Nassfeld skiing area) and his family helped to develop a solid skiing technique as well as a passion for the sport early on. The first racing experiences were gained at the age of five when Markus began to compete in local skiing cups against non-disabled age-peers. Even though these first races were not overly successful, the motivation to pursue a professional career as a skier did not wane. First contacts to the field of professional disabled sports were made during the winter of 2000. Since the 2003 / 2004 winter season Markus has been an active athlete member of various teams of the Austrian Skiing Federation (√ñSV).

A leader of the National Council of Romanian Women and the Association of Romanian Women, she served as Vice President of the International Council of Women, representing the International Alliance of Women, as well as Romania, to the League of Nations. However, her feminist beliefs and international profile clashed with her national conservatism, her support for eugenics, and eventually her conversion to fascism. Cantacuzino was a member of Romanian nobility, and, after her marriage to the wealthy landowner Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, claimed the title of \\"Princess\\". Her elitism and her feminism led her to join the upper-class charity SONFR, of which she became President after World War I. A wartime nurse, she became a herald of war remembrance initiatives (responsible, in large part, for the Mausoleum of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti). After her involvement with the National Council of Romanian Women, she supported limited women's suffrage within a corporatist framework, losing the support of liberal women, but also building connections with fascist politicians. Cantacuzino's policies within the Association of Romanian Women were mirrored in the legislation of World War II fascist regimes, beginning with the National Renaissance Front. Sympathetic toward the revolutionary fascist Iron Guard, of which her son Alecu was also an affiliate, Cantacuzino switched her support toward Ion Antonescu's government in early 1941. Having earlier reported to the League of Nations on the damages caused by the Spanish Civil War, she was also critical of Antonescu over the 1941 Odessa massacre. This was her last known public cause. Cantacuzino died, in relative obscurity, not long after Antonescu's downfall. Biography =Early life= Alexandra Pallady, also known under the pet name Didina, was born in CiocƒÉne»ôti, a village currently in D√¢mbovi»õa County (but, in 1876, still part of Ilfov County).Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89 Her birth date is known to have been September 20, 1876, but other sources credit it as 1877 or 1881. Marian Pruteanu, \\"Discursuri despre femeie √Æn Rom√¢nia dintre cele douƒÉ rƒÉzboaie mondiale\\" , in Alin CiupalƒÉ, Despre femei »ôi istoria lor √Æn Rom√¢nia, Editura UniversitƒÉ»õii Bucure»ôti, Bucharest, 2004 (e-book version at the University of Bucharest; retrieved March 8, 2014) She was by birth a member of the boyar upper-class: her father, Lieutenant Colonel Theodor Pallady (1847/1853‚Äì1916), an aristocrat from the eastern region (and former state) of Moldavia, had earned distinction in the Romanian Land Forces; her mother, also named Alexandrina (1845/1848‚Äì1881), was a Kretzulescu boyaress from Wallachia, and the heiress of a large estate.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89; Ion, p.276 Through Pallady's mother, Alexandrina descended from another boyar house, the Ghicas, who owned the manor in CiocƒÉne»ôti.Ion, p.276. See also CƒÉlinescu, p.702 The marriage produced four children in all, but Alexandrina was the only one to survive infancy. From an affair with a Maria Stamatiade, Theodor Pallady had a son, the future Symbolist poet-publicist Alexandru Teodor \\"Al. T.\\" Stamatiad (born 1885).CƒÉlinescu, p.702, 1016 Alexandrina's paternal family also produced other intellectual figures of importance: Theodor Iancu Pallady, the modernist painter, and Lucia Sturdza-Bulandra, the actress, were nephews of Lt. Col. Pallady, and as such cousins of Alexandrina and Al. T. Stamatiad.CƒÉlinescu, p.702 Upon her mother's death, the five-year-old Alexandrina was raised by her aunt, Eliza Ghica, and formally adopted by Eliza's husband, Vladimir M. Ghica.Ion, p.276. See also Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89 With Ghica money, she was able to pursue studies abroad, in France. In or around 1899, after Eliza Ghica's death,Ion, p.276 Alexandrina Pallady-Ghica was living in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, where she married the aspiring politician Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino‚Äîknown locally as Grigu»õƒÉ Cantacuzino or, mockingly, as Prensul (\\"Princeling\\").»òerban Cioculescu, Caragialiana, Editura Eminescu, Bucharest, 1974, p.378. Her full name subsequently became Alexandrina Grigore Cantacuzino (sometimes shortened as Alexandrina Gr. Cantacuzino), with the inclusion of her husband's name as a patronymic. The marriage propelled Cantacuzino into the high society, also bringing her into contact with the Conservative Party elite. The Cantacuzino family, of Phanariote origins, had been highly influential in the political affairs of Moldavia and Wallachia. Her father-in-law was the magistrate, Conservative policymaker and former Premier Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino (1833‚Äì1913). He was also one of the greatest estate-owners in the Kingdom of Romania, known to the general public as Nababul (\\"the Nawab\\").Bacalba»ôa, p.131; Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89 Simona LazƒÉr Tudor Cire»ô, \\"Un secol de la moartea lui George Grigore Cantacuzino, zis Nababul\\" , in Jurnalul Na»õional, March 23, 2013 Her brother-in-law was Mihail G. \\"Mi»ôu\\" Cantacuzino (1867‚Äì1928), who was the Minister of Justice and the leader of an inner-Conservative faction.Bacalba»ôa, p.7-8, 134, 136, 138 The Cantacuzinos stated claim to a princely title, which, although rendered useless under Romanian law, allowed Alexandrina to style herself \\"Princess Cantacuzino\\".Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89-90. CƒÉlinescu (p.702) hyphenates the word \\"Princess\\" when used in reference to Alexandrina Cantacuzino According to historian Marian Pruteanu, Alexandrina was \\"an avid collector of decorations and titles\\", who studied genealogy with the goal of establishing her blood relations with various noble families. Signs of her family wealth included one of Bucharest's first privately owned automobiles.CiupalƒÉ, caption to Illustration 18 =SONFR beginnings= Alexandrina and husband Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino in the family car, August 1900 Alexandrina and Grigore had three sons, all of them born between 1900 and 1905, before both parents resumed their public careers. In 1910, Alexandrina joined a Romanian Orthodox philanthropic society, the National Orthodox Society of Romanian Women (Societatea OrtodoxƒÉ Na»õionalƒÉ a Femeilor Rom√¢ne, SONFR). While she is most often credited as a founding member,Che»ôchebec (2006), p.90; CiupalƒÉ, p.89 the Society might have existed under a different name as early as 1893, with Ecaterina Cantacuzino, Gheorghe's wife, as its President.Filitti, p.6 The central core of SONFR was a group of high-society ladies, including Alexandrina Cantacuzino and, among others, Zoe R√¢mniceanu, Elena Odobescu, Anastasia Filipescu, Maria Glagoveanu, Sultana Miclescu and Zetta Manu.CiupalƒÉ, p.86, 89, 137 As indicated by the name, SONFR was situated on the conservative right of Romanian feminism, where it \\"reinforced women's traditional roles as mothers and wives\\",Bucur (2003), p.64 being entirely apolitical.CiupalƒÉ, p.94; Filitti, p.6 However, the Society was soon involved in a number of adjacent projects, such as disseminating propaganda among the Romanians of Transylvania, Bukovina, and other parts of Austria-Hungary, and circulating letters of protest against Magyarization.CiupalƒÉ, p.87-88 Although SONFR was sponsored by \\"the Nawab\\" and other mainline Conservatives, such ideological positions resonated with the National Liberal program of Spiru Haret, the Education Minister, who offered his full support.CiupalƒÉ, p.89-90 With such sources of revenue, supplemented by bank loans and private donations, SONFR established two girls' schools, 17 kindergartens (the first of which was in Doroban»õi), and 22 public libraries.CiupalƒÉ, p.90-94 Some of its funds went directly into purchasing land for Romanian peasant communities in Transylvania and elsewhere, with schools being built as far afield as Chernowitz, Geaca, and Markovac. SONFR's more formal mission was to combat \\"foreign religious propaganda\\" and \\"the foreign educational establishments\\", which it described as sources of corruption for young Romanian women.CiupalƒÉ, p.86 According to historian Alin CiupalƒÉ, these goals should be seen as reflecting the \\"borderline intolerant\\" position of Romanian Orthodoxy, but not particularly conclusive at that: \\"We believe that SONFR's would-be alliance with the Church determined the adoption by the Ladies' Society leadership of ideas circulated by some Orthodox hierarchs, especially those concerning Catholicism, but mostly with a tactical goal in mind. [...] Moreover, one might mention here the organizers' intent to make use, as it did, of the Church-controlled, nation-wide, infrastructure: the priests as instruments for propaganda and the influence, not just moral, of the leading Orthodox hierarchs.\\"CiupalƒÉ, p.86-87 SONFR members included liberal suffragettes, such as Calypso Botez; Cantacuzino herself was less clearly affiliated with this current, although she did describe herself a \\"feminist\\". As noted by gender historian Roxana Che»ôchebec, Cantacuzino was primarily an elitist, who believed in fulfilling a \\"historic mission of the upper classes\\", focusing on assisting \\"the socially disadvantaged as a way of serving the country and the nation.\\"Che»ôchebec (2006), p.90 The same is noted by Pruteanu, who also records her claim that Romanian nobility lived \\"outside the murderous luxury that surrounds us.\\" Pruteanu believes that Cantacuzino was \\"confused\\", with \\"a fractured identity\\", forever oscillating between \\"conformism and rebellion.\\" Meanwhile, in 1913, Grigore was appointed Mayor of Bucharest in the wake of the \\"Tramcar Affair\\", which had besmirched the opposition National Liberal Party. According to contemporary sources, he owed his appointment exclusively to \\"the Nawab\\", who was at the time performing his last official function, that of Senate President.Bacalba»ôa, p.105, 124-125, 152, 154 The immensely large Cantacuzino estate was split between the two sons, both of whom used the Zamora Castle of Bu»ôteni. It was to serve as a frequent retreat for the Romanian royal family. In 1915, Alexandrina also inherited the properties of her adoptive father, including CiocƒÉne»ôti. =World War I nurse= The start of World War I placed Romania in a delicate situation. From 1914 to the summer of 1916, the National Liberal cabinet of Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu preserved the country's neutrality (see Romania during World War I). Public opinion became sharply divided among supporters of the Entente Powers and the \\"Germanophiles\\"‚Äîwho favored the Central Powers, particularly Germany. Grigore Cantacuzino oscillated between the two sides, but his two newspapers, Minerva and Seara, were closely associated with Germanophilia.Boia, p.94, 191 In September 1914, they were bought from him by a German consortium, and became the mouthpieces of German propaganda.Boia, p.94 Following the 1916 Treaty with the Entente, King Ferdinand I and Premier BrƒÉtianu agreed to join the war against the Central Powers. This had the effect of silencing Germanophile dissidence. Alexandrina volunteered for work as a nurse.Bucur (2010), p.114 In August 1916, she became manager of the No. 113 Hospital, set up at the SONFR Institute in Bucharest with funds from the National Bank of Romania (her assistant managers were Elena Odobescu and Elena Perticari).CiupalƒÉ, p.94 By the end of the year, however, the Romanian Army was on the retreat everywhere, with the Germans in sight of Bucharest. King and government followed the Army retreat into Moldavia, where they remained besieged until 1918. The invasion further divided the Cantacuzino family, between those who aligned themselves with the German regime in Bucharest, and those who, as loyalists, fought against the Germans in Moldavia.Bucur (2010), p.114-115 The Zamora Castle was requisitioned by the Imperial German Army, serving as residence for the Governor, August von Mackensen. Robert Boucard, \\"Un r√©ception chez la princesse Cantacuz√®ne, VIII\\", in La Presse, October 27, 1927, p.2 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) Grigore was an associate of the Germanophile administration set up by Lupu Kostaki in Bucharest, but moreover a confidant of the skeptical Conservative Alexandru Marghiloman. Together with Marghiloman and others, he stood up to the Germans when it came to providing for civilian needs, such as when he procured firewood for the Bucharest populace.Theodorian-Carada, p.68-69 Reportedly, he also took a mediating position between Marghiloman, who remained respectful of King Ferdinand, and Petre P. Carp, who wanted the dynasty ousted and replaced.Theodorian-Carada, p.74-75 With Marghiloman as President of the Romanian Red Cross, Alexandrina became a member of the Red Cross \\"Ladies' Committee\\", working to provide humanitarian assistance for the prisoners-of- war in Romania and abroad.Dr. Metzulescu, \\"Pre»ôedintele Crucii Ro»ôii\\", in Lui Alexandru Marghiloman, omagiu cu prilejul unei √Ændoite aniversari: prietenii »ôi admiratorii lui, Editura Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, Bucharest, 1924, p.107-114 Her political attitudes at the time remain a mystery, with the exception of her belief that \\"a new world shall rise from the bloodied humanity\\"‚Äînot as an endorsement of political revolution, but as a trust in the ethnic Romanian capacity for work and rejuvenation. On several occasions, Cantacuzino stood up to the German authorities and protected SONFR's interests, usually with significant success.Filitti, p.7 SONFR was involved in smuggling recovering Romanian soldiers back into the Moldavian free zone. The hospital she managed was eventually evicted by the Germans, and Alexandrina published a letter a protest; she and her husband also spoke up in favor of Conon, the Metropolitan Bishop, who was being pressured into handing in the church administration to Mariu Theodorian-Carada, a Catholic.AlimƒÉni»ôteanu, p.26, 34-35 Such shows of dissent almost led to Alexandrina's own imprisonment in a German camp.AlimƒÉni»ôteanu, p.26-27; Che»ôchebec (2006), p.90 =Marghiloman government= Alexandrina returned to work at the hospital. She decided to hold a banquet there in honor of Alexandru D. Sturdza and other defectors from the loyalist Romanian Army. The affair ended in a brawl between the party guests and the inmates-patients they ran into.AlimƒÉni»ôteanu, p.107-108 In late 1917, with the fall of its Russian Republican backers, the BrƒÉtianu administration collapsed in Moldavia, leaving Ferdinand to ponder an armistice with the Germans. In Bucharest, the Marghiloman Conservatives created their own Legislative Commission, with the aim of achieving peace and reconciliation; Grigore Cantacuzino was among its members, but failed to win appointment in the subsequent Marghiloman Cabinet.Theodorian-Carada, p.79-81 The year 1918 ended in unexpected defeat for the Germanophiles: the November Armistice signaled a sudden victory for the Entente Powers, and instantly brought the fall of Marghiloman's administration. Alexandrina Cantacuzino, who witnessed the events, mediated between the disgraced Marghiloman and General Alexandru Averescu, the King's favorite minister, circulating rumors that Romania was prey to revolutionary socialism.Marghiloman, p.184-185 Organizing the welcome-back celebrations for Queen Marie, she also urged Marghiloman to stay indoors, because the Entente's military mission and the general populace wished to avoid him.Marghiloman, p.155, 162 As a tribute to her patriotic actions, Cantacuzino was elected SONFR president in 1918; she would lead the Society until 1938.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89, 90 Sabina Cantacuzino, BrƒÉtianu's sister and an in-law of Alexandrina's, observed her recovery from the side. In her memoirs, published in 1937, she accuses Alexandrina of staging \\"an advertisement\\". In her view, the SONFR leader making \\"a public show\\" of her compassion toward Romanian soldiers, while secure in the knowledge that Grigore Cantacuzino was in favor with the Germans.Bucur (2010), p.84 Such claims are also found in the diaries of Pia AlimƒÉni»ôteanu (BrƒÉtianu's daughter and Sabina's niece), who additionally writes that \\"Didina\\" enjoyed \\"hunting with the hounds and running with the hare\\".AlimƒÉni»ôteanu, p.26, 107 These views were met with opprobrium upon publishing: Sabina's work was dismissed as a libelous sample of BrƒÉtianu's \\"monopoly on patriotism\\".Bucur (2010), p.84. See also Podgoreanu & Costache, p.121-122 The Conservative Party was in disarray, losing its members in droves. Marghiloman held on to the unpopular \\"Conservative\\" title (later \\"Conservative-Progressive\\"), while Grigore Cantacuzino advised in favor of reforming it as a \\"Constitutional Party\\", or merging it into Averescu's more successful People's Party.Theodorian-Carada, p.88-89, 90-91, 119-120 The brothers' \\"Cantacuzino Conservative\\" group became a virtually independent faction, sometimes in rebellion against Marghiloman's orders, and sympathetic to the breakaway Conservative-Democratic Party.Marghiloman, p.126-127, 134, 144, 225, 232, 244, 265-266, 322, 345, 371, 392 However, both Grigore and Marghiloman were horrified by the promise of land reform, and, contrary to the moderate Conservatives, wanted the party to represent, as before 1914, the interests of landowners.Theodorian-Carada, p.90-91 =CNFR creation and SONFR presidency= After the creation of Greater Romania, SONFR negotiated its collaboration with the secular wing of the women's movement. Cantacuzino herself became a member of the nation-wide Association for the Civil and Political Emancipation of Romanian Women (AECPFR), and unsuccessfully tried to absorb the smaller League for Women's Rights and Duties (LDDF) into SONFR. In June 1919, she was also elected honorary president of the female section within the \\"Cross Brotherhood\\", founded by right-wing nationalist Amos Fr√¢ncu at Cluj.Cor., \\"Constituirea 'FrƒÉ»õiilor de cruce' »ôi Cununa surorilor de cruce din Cluj\\", in Rom√¢nul (Arad), Nr. VIII/1919, p.2 In 1921, aiming to create an all-Romanian feminist representative body, she was made Vice President of the newly formed National Council of Romanian Women, CNFR; the President was Calypso Botez, of SONFR fame.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89, 90; Daskalova, p.191 Around 1923, she was one of the conservative proponents of women's suffrage, criticizing the postwar constitution for failing to enact it.Eufrosina Popescu, \\"Dezbaterea problemei emancipƒÉrii femeii √Æn Parlament »ôi √Æn afara lui (1922‚Äî1923)\\", in Revista de Istorie, Nr. 12/1975, p.1887 During those years, Cantacuzino worked as a permanent lecturer for Casele Na»õionale association.Constantin Mohanu, Jean Bart (Eugeniu Botez). Via»õa »ôi opera, Editura Biblioteca Bucure»ôtilor, Bucharest, 2001, p.166. She took up similar activities at SONFR, where she lectured about the Orthodox and nationalist ethos, attracting into Society ranks many female members of the middle classes, as well as new arrivals from the province of Bessarabia: Elena AlistarConstantin, p.203 and Iulia Siminel- Dicescu. It was Cantacuzino's stated goal that the \\"new world\\" of the interwar period signified the end of \\"doll-like women\\", of \\"women as eternal children\\", of \\"women as objects of pleasure\\"; a woman's new \\"gospel\\" was to be written among \\"morality in public life\\". While advocating the emergence of a \\"mother- citizen\\" generation, she deplored the rapid urbanization of the age, claiming that village children were abandoning \\"the great reservoir of family life\\" so as to \\"quickly become Mr. and Mrs. this-and-that\\". In contrast with the AECPFR, Cantacuzino and the CNFR represented a \\"national reformist\\" side of the feminist current. As Che»ôchebec notes, such women intellectuals \\"aimed to appease fears of the destructive potential of feminist 'individualism', offering the 'acceptable' and 'nationally authentic' face of Romanian feminism.\\" Their publicity efforts were fruitless, since: \\"despite ideological differences, all feminists aimed to alter the traditional family order. This common feature blurred the differences between various strands of feminism.\\"Che»ôchebec (2012), p.365 For Cantacuzino, Romanian Orthodoxy was \\"the blessed shield of the Romanian nation\\", with priests and women holding complementary positions as defenders of traditional life. At SONFR, where she still invested most of her efforts, she tackled generic Orthodox causes, such as taking sides with Meletius IV, the Ecumenical Patriarch, in his conflict with Kemalist Turkey.Catherine Durandin, \\"Orthodoxie et Roumanit√©: Le d√©bat de l'entre deux guerres\\", in Keith Hitchins (ed.), Rumanian Studies. Vol. V: 1980‚Äì1985, Brill Publishers, Leiden, 1979, p.113. She was also strongly opposed to a Concordat between Romania and the Holy See, calling the Catholic Church an entity \\"entirely adverse\\" to the Romanian \\"unitary state\\", while referring to Byzantine Rite Catholics as Orthodoxy's \\"brothers\\".Alexandrina Gr. Cantacuzino, \\"Proectul de Concordat. Datoria credincio»ôilor ortodoxi\\", in Biserica »ôi »òcoala, Nr. 31/1924, p.30-31 Under her management, SONFR heralded a number of initiatives, including the creation of schools, hospitals, and workers' canteens. Following its involvement in the work to recover and honor the remains of soldiers killed in battle, SONFR found itself locked in a bitter rivalry with the Cultul Eroilor (\\"Heroes' Cult\\") organization, although Cantacuzino served on the leadership boards of both organizations.Bucur (2010), p.115 According to historian Maria Bucur, Cantacuzino embarked on \\"a two-decade struggle to become the custodian of the public remembrance of the war.\\"Bucur (2010), p.99 The way Cantacuzino saw it, the reburial of bones was an essentially female-and-Orthodox task, since women were traditionally experts in parastas services. On such grounds, SONFR secured a virtual monopoly over the projects to honor those fallen in the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, their identification, and their annual commemoration.Bucur (2010), p.115-116 =GFR and rise to prominence= Zamora (Cantacuzino) Castle in Bu»ôteni, ca. 1928 Although a nationalist at home, Cantacuzino was soon involved in the international women's movement, often as a Romanian representative. It was part of her power-sharing deal with Botez that she should deal with the external affairs of CNFR.Daskalova, p.191 In 1923, she was the LDDF's delegate to the Congress International Alliance of Women (IAWSA, IAWSEC) Congress in Rome.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.91 While abroad, she created a female version of the Little Entente, of which she was President until 1924. Dubbed \\"Little Entente of Women\\" (Mica AntantƒÉ a Femeilor, MAF), or \\"Women of the Small Nations\\",\\"Holds Many Offices\\", in The Trenton Sun, April 29, 1926, p.2 it aligned Romanian feminist organizations with like-minded sororities from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Greece and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89, 91; Daskalova, p.194 She was generally hostile to the ethnic minorities, but also interested in finding common ground with feminists from the Transylvanian Saxon and Hungarian communities, inviting them to the women's congress of 1925.Horia Trandafir, \\"Reabilitarea femeii\\", in Societatea de M√¢ine, Nr. 39/1925, p.668 From 1925 to 1936, with a CNFR mandate, Cantacuzino served as Vice President of the International Council of Women (ICW), and, as such became Romania's best-known feminist.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89, 91 She was one of the European delegates to ICW's 1925 Conference in Washington, D. C..CiupalƒÉ, captions to Illustrations 19 and 20 By 1926, her distinctions included the Grand Cross of Queen Marie, the Order of the Holy Sepulchre (Collar), the Order of St. Sava (Great Officer), the Croix de guerre (Officer) and the Croce al Merito di Guerra (Officer). She was IWC delegate at the League of Nations in 1927, and again in 1933, as well as IAWSEC rapporteur to the same international body (1926, 1928, 1933). Drifting apart from both the LDDF and AECPFR, who accused her of using feminism to advance her own \\"internationalist\\" goals, Cantacuzino presided upon Solidaritatea (\\"Solidarity\\"), her very own feminist sorority, enlisting it with IAWSEC as a separate body.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89, 90-91; Daskalova, p.191 Under the provisions of a law which allowed some women to run in local elections, Cantacuzino served on the Bucharest Financial Commission in 1927, and was a City Councilor after 1928, helping to establish the CNFR-run vocational school for female \\"social auxiliaries\\".Che»ôchebec (2006), p.92 She was dividing her time between Bucharest and Zamora Castle, where, in August 1928, her eldest son Gheorghe Grigore married Zoe Greceanu.\\"Bu»ôteni-Zamora\\", in Cultura Poporului, September 1, 1928, p.4 Cantacuzino immersed herself in the struggle for electoral emancipation, lobbying for women's right to vote and run in elections for urban and rural citizens' councils. To this goal, she created in 1929 an Association of Romanian Women (Gruparea Femeilor Rom√¢ne, GFR), of which she became President, while preserving control over CNFR and the smaller Solidaritatea.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89, 92; (2012), p.367; Daskalova, p.191-192 One of the GFR's main goals, cemented in its charter, was \\"an active propaganda work, oral as well as written, among the feminine masses\\"; another one was the setting up of Initiative Committees for female representation. Alexandra Petrescu, \\"Femeile »ôi politica autoritarƒÉ\\", in Sfera Politicii, Nr. 120-121-122/2006 However, the GFR remained highly centralized, and no clear criterion for admitting or rejecting membership was ever recorded in its statutes. Political scientist Alexandra Petrescu finds that the GFR, a \\"matriarchal\\" order, mimicked the \\"masculine hierarchy\\" of traditional political parties, effectively subverting the democratizing process of first- wave feminism. Cantacuzino participated in the grand rally of 150 women's societies, held at Funda»õiile Regale, Bucharest, on April 28 of that year.Che»ôchebec (2012), p.367 This resulted in a minor victory: a new law was passed in August 1929, allowing most professional women and all war widows to vote and participate in council elections.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.92; (2012), p.367; Daskalova, p.191 Her notoriety was reflected in other areas. She was the first-ever woman Officer of the Meritul Cultural Order.Che»ôchebec (2006), 92 In 1928, she was a Miss Romania judge, together with, among others, Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, Maria Giurgea and Liviu Rebreanu. Dumitru H√Æncu, \\"Al. Tzigara-Samurca»ô - Din amintirile primului vorbitor la Radio rom√¢nesc\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 42/2007 She also served as head of the Female Section during the June 1929 International Agricultural Congress.\\"Congresul Interna»õional Agricol\\", in Arhiva pentru »òtiin»õƒÉ »ôi ReformƒÉ SocialƒÉ, Nr. 4/1929, p.719 Cantacuzino was co-opted among the official Romanian representatives to the League of Nations (uninterruptedly, from 1929 to 1938), primarily as adviser on women and child protection.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.89, 91-92 Meanwhile, together with art historian Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô, she set up a Union of Intellectuals at a formal gala in 1926.Podgoreanu & Costache, p.137 This circle was a local affiliate of Europe's Federation of Intellectual Unions, whose founders included Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Paul Val√©ry and Nicolae Titulescu, and whose stated mission was finding a solution to \\"the vital crisis of the continent\\". Carmen BrƒÉgaru, \\"Ion Pillat »ôi Liga Na≈£iunilor\\", in Ex Ponto, Nr. 3/2012, p.99 One of its members was journalist Constantin Beldie, who left sarcastic notes about the Union's cultural conservatism. Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Memoriile unui hedonist\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 41/2000 Received and celebrated in Prague by Methodius Zavoral, Abbot of Strahov Monastery (1928), Cantacuzino was also a delegate to the Federation of Intellectual Unions Congress in Barcelona (October 1929).Podgoreanu & Costache, p.85-86, 130 =Fascist transformation= Cantacuzino (front row, third from right) and other SONFR delegates at a Bucharest rally for women's suffrage, March 1932 Beginning with the deaths of King Ferdinand and BrƒÉtianu, Romania went through a political power shift: in 1930, the junior king, Michael I, was toppled by his own father, the disgraced Carol II. In the realm of feminism, Cantacuzino rose to the position of CNFR President. This followed the protest resignation of Calypso Botez, part of an anti-Cantacuzino schism inside the CNFR.Che»ôchebec (2006), p.91; Daskalova, p.191 Also in 1930, Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino died, leaving Alexandrina a widow. She never remarried. Over several years, Alexandrina Cantacuzino's nationalism mutated into authoritarianism. By then, the apparent successes of Italian fascism, which probably impressed Cantacuzino during her visit to Rome, had widened the fault line in the Romanian feminist movement. Cantacuzino was won over by the fascist critique of liberal democracy, and, while still a feminist, began voicing support for an alternative to Romania's own liberal regime. Cantacuzino envisaged a corporatist monarchy, campaigned for a technocratic public administration service, and favored disfranchising the poorly educated males (while enfranchising educated women).Che»ôchebec (2012), p.367-368 As argued by Alexandra Petrescu, the GFR's ideology mutated into the \\"Latin\\" feminism promoted, on occasion, by Benito Mussolini himself, with its vision of Latin women as equal combatants in a corporatist revolution. This switch in allegiance was occurring just as the Little Entente of Women began fading into insignificance. Cantacuzino was vehemently opposed to the other delegates, including Greece's Avra Theodoropoulou, over the issue of admitting women from Bulgaria, Republican Turkey and Albania.Daskalova, p.194 The GFR, unlike all other feminist groups, banned women from enlisting in party politics, but encouraged them to run in municipal elections as they pleased. According to Petrescu, this demand should be contrasted with the GFR's structure and goals, which, she argues, are those of an informal political party. Cantacuzino voiced her ideas in the GFR and CNFR petitions of December 1930 and March 1932, while also asking that representatives of women's organizations be assigned seats in the Senate. In 1933, she spoke in front of GFR members about the corporatist \\"reconstruction\\" of Romania, drafting out her own project for senatorial \\"corporatist elections\\" by men- and women-electors. The immediate effect of such interventions was the creation of a GFR youth wing, Tinerele Grupiste, likely modeled on Italy's Gruppo Universitario Fascista (but, unlike it, focused only on campaigns for female employment). Researchers are divided when it comes to evaluating the actual appeal of Cantacuzino's nationalist feminism. Bucur writes that \\"most feminists, like Alexandrina Cantacuzino, were also aggressive, even jingoistic nationalists\\".Bucur (2010), p.279 Contrarily, Petrescu notes: \\"Alexandrina Cantacuzino is the interwar's only feminist to have let herself be seduced by authoritarianism.\\" The AECPFR and other organizations repudiated Cantacuzino, declaring themselves for emancipation within the format of liberal democracy.Che»ôchebec (2012), p.368 Occasionally, Cantacuzino herself still showed interest in the development of democratic societies: a guest of the Friends of America society on Washington's Birthday, 1932, she lectured about \\"Different Aspects of American Life and Culture\\".\\"Rumania\\", in History of the George Washington Bicentennial Celebration. Foreign Participation, George Washington Bicentennial Commission, Washington, D. C., 1932, p.421. Although no longer serving as ICW Vice President in 1936, she was made Convener of its Fine and Applied Arts Committee, as well as delegate to the Joint Conference of the International Council of Women and the International Council of Women in Calcutta, British India. In January 1934, Dimitrie Gusti's Romanian Social Institute elected her on its steering committee.\\"Buletinul Institutului Social Rom√¢n\\", in Arhiva pentru »òtiin»õa »ôi Reforma SocialƒÉ, Nr. 3-4/1935, p.616 At home, her eclectic feminist program included a project for making paramilitary services fully staffed by women, with the goal of achieving the total conscription of men. Xenophobia tinged Cantacuzino's writings from an early stage: in the early 1920s, she opined that \\"foreign-ism\\" was one of the factors working against female emancipation, having \\"dragged the tender soul that is womanhood out of her home and to purposeless partying.\\" However, her stated internationalism was rejected by even more radical SONFR nationalists. This anti-Masonic wing of SONFR resigned in 1934, after Cantacuzino refused to testify, under oath, that she was not a covert Freemason. By 1937, in tune with the National Christian Party regime, Cantacuzino had embraced eugenics, racism, and antisemitism. At a meeting in Cluj, she proposed the introduction of legislation banning all \\"foreigners\\" and minorities from marrying Romanian state employees, as well as 10-year reviews for all Romanian citizenship applications. Additionally, she and the GFR envisaged state bonuses for \\"eugenic\\" marriages between full-blooded Romanian youths. Meanwhile, her connections in the international feminist movement became alarmed by the growth of antisemitic violence. In a December 1933 letter to Cantacuzino, C√©cile Brunschvicg inquired: \\"there is talk of terrible antisemitic campaigns in Romania, and of the development of a Nazi spirit in your country. Is this true? [...] It would really be a deplorable if [the Nazi] spirit were to win over a Latin country that is so sane, and so very close to our hearts.\\" C√©cile Formaglio, \\"C√©cile Brunschvicg, femme, f√©ministe, juive, face aux d√©fis de l‚Äôint√©gration et de la neutralit√© religieuse\\" , in Les Archives du F√©minisme, Nr. 9, December 2005 =Between Carol and the Iron Guard= The 1938 Constitution seemed to agree with most of Cantacuzino's authoritarian-and- corporatist ideals, including women's suffrage with overall disenfranchisement, and even female conscription. Transformed by King Carol's decrees into a corporatist chamber, and controlled by the National Renaissance Front, the Senate received its first female member, Maria M. Pop, in 1939. She was not a GFR appointee, but rather an old AECPFR combatant. For her part, Cantacuzino still held diplomatic assignments at the League of Nations, this time representing the Romanian government. She was tasked with improving the livelihoods of children and women affected by the Spanish Civil War, proposing the creation of neutral zones for children, and working on an internationally valid Children's Charter. There were already signs that a rift was occurring between King Carol and the fascist feminists. In September 1938, Cantacuzino was a guest of honor at the Mausoleum of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti inauguration, where she spoke about SONFR's contribution to the \\"eternal remembrance\\" of World War I heroes; she also called to memory the \\"Glorious Reign\\" of King Ferdinand as a \\"Symbol of the Fatherland\\" and \\"the Soul among Souls\\".Bucur (2010), p.98-99 According to Bucur, the speech can be read as a jibe at both Cultul Eroilor and King Carol, whose conduct in wartime had been less than honorable. At the GFR Congress in Bra»ôov, Cantacuzino publicly complained that her goal of achieving women's suffrage had turned into a bitter victory. It is unclear whether or not she supported the Iron Guard, a rival, largely underground, fascist movement. Other members of the Cantacuzino clan were enthusiastic supporters. A distant relative, General Gheorghe Cantacuzino-GrƒÉnicerul, had been an associate of the Guard's leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu since 1933, and became the Guard's second-in-command from 1937.Ornea, p.204, 300, 303-306, 309, 375 From 1935, Alexandrina's youngest son, Alexandru \\"Alecu\\" Cantacuzino, a former member of the diplomatic corps,Tra»ôcƒÉ & Born, p.298 was also attracted into this political venture. He wrote tracts disseminating the Iron Guard's ideology, focusing on praise of its \\"irrational and persistent impulse\\",Radu Ioanid, \\"The Sacralised Politics of the Romanian Iron Guard\\", in Roger Griffin (ed.), Fascism, Totalitarianism and Political Religion, Routledge, Oxon, 2006, p.128-129. but also relating to \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\", eugenics, race, and sexuality.Bucur (2003), p.67-68; Ornea, p.353-355, 357, 367-369 In 1936, he was one of the Guard's volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, on the Nationalist side. This episode upset his mother, who reportedly called his actions \\"idiotic\\". Alecu returned home in February 1937, and given a hero's reception at the Mo»õa‚ÄìMarin funeral.Valentin SƒÉndulescu, \\"Sacralised Politics in Action: the February 1937 Burial of the Romanian Legionary Leaders Ion Mo»õa and Vasile Marin\\", in Matthew Feldman, Marius Turda, Tudor Georgescu (eds.), Clerical Fascism in Interwar Europe, Routledge, Oxon, 2008, p.53-54. The Iron Guard accepted Alecu, but mistrusted Alexandrina, seeing her as a dangerous internationalist. In a 1937 letter (recovered and published in 2005), General Cantacuzino-GrƒÉnicerul threatens Alexandrina to stop intervening between him, Alecu, and Codreanu, accusing her of having \\"filled our Orthodox schools with kikes\\" and of \\"preach[ing] an entente with the enemies of the people.\\" Before the close of 1938, King Carol's police forces clamped down on the Iron Guard, and killed Codreanu in custody. Alexandrina was placed her under surveillance, suspected of having helped the outlawed movement,Che»ôchebec (2006), p.92; Tra»ôcƒÉ & Born, p.298 while her GFR and Tinerele Grupiste were also outlawed. Alecu was detained at the concentration camp in R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat, where, unbeknown to his family, he was shot dead by the guards (September 22, 1939).Tra»ôcƒÉ & Born, p.298, 304 Around October, rumors spread that Alexandrina and her other sons were also about to be interned; the authorities eventually decided to monitor Alexandrina by placing her under house arrest.Tra»ôcƒÉ & Born, p.297-298, 304 =World War II and death= The final stage of Cantacuzino's career covers saw her collateral involvement in the political upheavals of World War II. During late 1940, Carol fell from power, and the Iron Guard established its \\"National Legionary State\\". At its helm was an army man and political maverick, ConducƒÉtor Ion Antonescu, on whose behalf Alexandrina Cantacuzino had intervened in the past.Constantin, p.116 As noted by Che»ôchebec, Alecu's killing \\"apparently is not related to Cantacuzino's show of support for the legionary regime\\". Her decision to join the Iron Guard was motivated, according to Bucur, by \\"sheer opportunism or because [she] hoped to carve out a leading, powerful role in such a dynamic movement\\", and most likely not by fear of reprisals.Bucur (2003), p.76-77 Signs of this rapprochement are recorded in the Guard's newspapers: in 1940, Porunca Vremii published Lucrezzia Karnabatt's interview with Cantacuzino, where she described the political role of women in the National Legionary regime.Bucur (2003), p.77 After the January 1941 battle between the Guard and Antonescu, which was won by the latter, Cantacuzino endured an Antonescu supporter. By June, Antonescu had agreed to participate in Operation Barbarossa: as an ally of the Nazi Germany, Romania recaptured the lost province of Bessarabia. In an article for the official propaganda paper, Universul, Cantacuzino celebrated \\"the holy hour\\" as the definitive end of \\"Jewish democracy\\", and envisaged a redemption of Europe under fascist rule. Lucian Vasile, \\"Manipularea din presƒÉ √Æn prima lunƒÉ din al doilea rƒÉzboi mondial\\", in Historia, April 2011 The Antonescu regime soon enforced racial antisemitism across the land. According to Alexandra Petrescu, the legislation introduced at the time was remarkably similar with the Cantacuzino project of 1937. Cantacuzino was not an uncritical affiliate of Antonescu's policies, as she showed during her October 1941 visit Odessa, capital of newly occupied Transnistria. It took place just days after the Antonescu-ordered massacre of Odessan Jews, of which she was informed by the City Mayor, Gherman P√¢ntea. P√¢ntea believed the massacre to have been incidental, not deliberate. Using Cantacuzino as his messenger, asked Antonescu to punish the guilty parties and allow Jewish deportees back in Odessa.Constantin, p.114-116, 259 P√¢ntea reports that Cantacuzino shared his belief that the massacre was going to weigh heavily on \\"the entire country\\", and that \\"an objective inquiry\\" was needed; he writes that Antonescu threatened to shoot him for disobedience, but that he changed his mind, and even that he lived to regret his order for massacre.Constantin, p.116-117 Cantacuzino continued to intervene with Antonescu on other matters, such as when she obtained the naturalization of Pavel Chasovnikov, an Odessan surgeon.Constantin, p.138 Cantacuzino died in September, October, or November 1944. This was closely after King Michael's Coup, which had resulted in Antonescu's arrest and the denunciation of Romania's Nazi alliance. Historian Ion Constantin claims that she committed suicide, \\"to avoid the torment of detention under the Romanian communist regime\\". Roxana Che»ôchebec, however, records her death cause as \\"old age\\". She was survived by Gheorghe Cantacuzino, who pursued a career in archeology, epigraphy, and papyrology; he died in 1977.Constantin Preda, \\"Cantacuzino, Gheorghe I.\\" [sic], in Enciclopedia istoriografiei rom√¢ne»ôti, Editura »òtiin»õificƒÉ »ôi EnciclopedicƒÉ, Bucharest, 1978, p.80-81 In the years following Alexandrina's death, Zamora Castle was nationalized, then assigned to the Interior Ministry; reclaimed by the Cantacuzinos after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, and finally reassigned to them in 2004, it was later sold to other private owners. The CiocƒÉne»ôti manor, confiscated from Gheorghe Cantacuzino, was classified as a historical monument and Writers' Union vacation home, but not before being thoroughly devastated by the local trade unions.Ion, p.276-281 It was also nationalized in 1949, but continued to be looted after that date.Ion, p.281-282 Notes References * Pia AlimƒÉni»ôteanu, √énsemnƒÉri din timpul ocupa»õiei germane, Independen»õa, Bucharest, 1929 * Constantin Bacalba»ôa, Bucure»ôtii de altƒÉdatƒÉ.

P.) is a ballet score composed by the Mexican composer Carlos Ch√°vez in 1926‚Äì32. A shortened concert version is published as Suite sinf√≥nica del ballet Caballos de vapor. History Diego Rivera, 19 March 1932 Caballos de vapor originated in discussions between the composer and the painter Agust√≠n Lazo Adalid in 1922 or 1923 about a multi-media work concerning mechanization and its impact on society in modern-day Mexico (; ). According to another account, however, it was only first in 1926 that the idea was born, in discussions with another visual artist, Diego Rivera, and Rivera was intended to design and produce the decor and costumes . In any case, the music was composed in stages, beginning in 1926 with the fourth movement, originally scored for a small orchestra. It was premiered as a separate piece in a concert of the International Composers Guild at the Aeolian Hall in New York, under the baton of Eugene Goosens, on November 28, 1926. This was followed by portions of the second and third movements, which were originally intended to end with the \\"Danza √°gil\\" (originally called \\"Gimn√°stica\\") and the \\"Sandunga\\", respectively. The first movement was written in 1929, and was for large orchestra from the beginning. In 1931 Ch√°vez expanded the orchestration of the second and third movements. The final touch was accomplished in February 1932 when Ch√°vez added the \\"Danza general\\" to end the second movement (; ). The completed ballet was premiered in Philadelphia by the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company, with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski on March 31, 1932. Stage direction was by Wilhelm von Wymetal, Jr., sets and costumes were by Diego Rivera, and choreography by Catherine Littlefield. Alexis Dolinoff and Dorothie Littlefield danced the principal roles. The composer was in the audience . \\"A special train brought in a New York audience to add to the Philadelphia patrons. Aboard the train were, among other luminaries, Diego Rivera and his wife, the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo; George Gershwin; and Ch√°vez's friend Aaron Copland\\" . In 1954 Ch√°vez revised the ballet, restoring a few small cuts that had been made for the Philadelphia premiere and reducing the size of the orchestra somewhat. This version was partially premiered in Los Angeles in August, and the complete ballet in Portland, Oregon in October 1954 . Instrumentation The original ballet scoring was for a very large orchestra with winds mostly in fours: * Piccolo * 3 flutes * 3 oboes * cor anglais * 2 E clarinets * 2 B clarinets * bass clarinet * 3 bassoons * contrabassoon * soprano saxophone * tenor saxophone * 5 horns * 4 trumpets * 3 tenor trombones * bass trombone * tuba * timpani * 5 percussionists * first violins * second violins * violas * cellos * double basses From July to September 1954, Ch√°vez reduced the orchestration somewhat to an \\"a 3\\" basis, while retaining the saxophones . This is the scoring also used in the Suite: * Piccolo * 2 flutes * 2 oboes * cor anglais * E clarinet * 2 B clarinets * bass clarinet * 2 bassoons * contrabassoon * soprano saxophone * tenor saxophone * 4 horns * 3 trumpets * 2 tenor trombones * bass trombone * tuba * timpani * 3 percussionists * first violins * second violins * violas * cellos * double basses Musical form The score is designated a \\"dance symphony\\". Though it is not among the composer's numbered symphonies, it falls into the traditional four movements of a symphony, but they are further subdivided into a succession of dances: *I. Danza del hombre (Dance of the Man) *II. El barco (alias Barco hacia el tr√≥pico‚ÄîBoat to the Tropics) **Danza √°gil **Tango de las sirenas (alias Tango, molto lento) **Danza general *Intermedio tropical (alias Interludio) *III. El tr√≥pico (The Tropics) **Huapango **Sandunga (Tempo di Sandunga) *Intermedio II (alias Interludio II) *IV. Danza de los hombres y las m√°quinas (Dance of men and machines) The Suite omits the \\"Danza final\\" from the second movement, the second intermedio, and the entire fourth movement. Otherwise, it is identical with the ballet score in the 1954 orchestration. Discography =Complete ballet= No recording of the complete ballet has been published. Robert , citing an unpublished interview with Eduardo Mata from 13 August 1980, states that by that time Mata had made a recording with the London Symphony Orchestra that \\"includes the music for all four movements of the ballet\\". However, the recording eventually issued by RCA was only made later, in December 1980, and is of the Suite (see below). =Symphonic Suite= * Danza moderna mexicana.

Before the genocide had begun one method used to intimidate the Armenian population was sexual humiliation. Women and young girls were not only subjected to rape, but also forced marriage, torture, forced prostitution, being sold into slavery and sexual mutilation. Heinrich Bergfeld, the German Consul to Trabzon reported \\"the numerous rapes of women and girls,\\" which crime he regarded as being part of a plan for \\"the virtually complete extermination of the Armenians.\\" The systematic use of rape during the genocide was testified to by Turkish, American, Austrian, and German witnesses and officials.  Background  In the years between 1850 and 1870 the Patriarch of Armenia submitted 537 letters to the Sublime Porte asking for help to protect the Armenians from the violent abuse and social and political injustice they were subjected to. He requested the people be protected from \\"brigandage, murder, abduction and rape of women and children, confiscatory taxes, and fraud and extortion by local officials.\\" Within the legal system the Armenian communities had their own prisons and court systems, and were able to hold civil cases for issues between Christians and Muslims. Within the Islamic judicial system the Armenians had no recourse, a Muslim was allowed to request a hearing before a religious court, in which testimony from non-Muslims would be disallowed or given little value. All a Muslim needed to do to get a case settled was swear on the Koran. Because of this the Armenians, as well as other dhimmi, had little hope within the judicial system. According to Peter Balakian, \\"a well-armed Kurd or Turk could not only steal his [Armenian] host's possessions but could rape or kidnap the women and girls of the household with impunity.\\" \\"The amount of theft and extortion, as well as rape and abduction of Armenian women, that was allowed under this Ottoman legal system placed the Armenians in perpetual jeopardy.\\" In 1895, Frederick Davis Greene, published The Armenian Crisis in Turkey: The Massacre of 1894, Its Antecedents and Significance. The book made note of the fact that men were murdered out of hand, while the women and children suffered appalling sexual attacks. In one incident he described, > A lot of women, variously estimated from 60 to 160 in number, were shut up > in a church, and the soldiers were \\"let loose\\" among them. Many were > outraged to death, and the remainder dispatched with sword and bayonet. > Children were placed in a row, one behind another, and a bullet fired down > the line, apparently to see how many could be dispatched with one bullet. > Infants and small children were piled one on the other and their heads > struck off. The genocide of 1915 was planned well in advance. A document obtained by Commander C. H. Heathcote Smith of the British Naval Volunteer Service, which was dubbed \\"The Ten Commandments\\" gave a detailed account of how the genocide was to be carried out. The genocide began following the outbreak of World War I. Armenians serving in the Turkish armed forces were removed and killed. The Armenian civilian population were sent on forced marches and denied food and water. In a strategy similar to the tactics used by the German Empire in German South-West Africa, the Armenians were forced into the desert. On the line of march the women, young girls and boys were systematically raped, mutilated and tortured. Hundreds of thousands died on these forced marches.  Rape as genocide  Armenians on a forced march. Women were regularly attacked on these. One objective of genocidal rape is forced pregnancy; however, those unable to bear children are also subject to sexual assault. Victims ages can range from children to women in their eighties. During the Armenian Genocide the rape of young girls was well documented; they would be assaulted in their homes before forced relocation, or on the forced marches into the Syrian desert. An eyewitness testified, \\"It was a very common thing for them to rape our girls in our presence. Very often they violated eight or ten year old girls, and as a consequence many would be unable to walk, and were shot.\\" Another testified that every girl in her village aged over twelve, and some who were younger, had been raped. Women were gang raped and often committed suicide afterwards. Once the men had been separated from the women, the women were systematically raped and then killed, along with any children. According to eyewitness accounts, the practice of rape was \\"more or less universal\\". Armenians \\"were often killed in festivals of cruelty which involved rape and other forms of torture.\\" The women were raped on a daily basis and were forced to work as prostitutes. Many were killed by bayoneting, or died from exposure or from prolonged sexual abuse. In 2008, A. Dirk Moses described genocide as a \\"total social practice.\\" Within this context, rape can be viewed as an integral part of genocide. Genocides usually involve attacking the familial roles of the victims, which are the ways they contribute to the reproduction of the targeted group as perceived by the perpetrators. Commonalities across all genocides are the murder of infants in front of parents, forced rape of women by family members, and the violation and mutilation of the reproductive systems. The Armenian genocide is a prime example of these behaviors. The attackers follow a pattern of family based destruction. In attacks on villages men were killed, and the surviving population were raped, forcibly dislocated or killed. Another purpose of the rapes was eliticide, the destruction of a group's leadership, which was then used to create confusion. This gave a public demonstration of the mastery the attackers had over the Armenian populace, and caused \\"total suffering\\" on both sexes, as they bore witness to sexual assault and the torture of those they loved. = Instances and accounts = According to Taner Ak√ßam, forced prostitution, rape and sexual abuse were widespread, and military commanders told their men to \\"Do to them whatever you wish\\". Members of the German armed forces in Der Zor helped to open a brothel. Throughout the genocide the men were given free licence to do as they pleased with Armenian women. Armenian women and children were displayed naked in auctions in Damascus, where they were sold as sex slaves. The trafficking of Armenian women as sex slaves was an important source of income for accompanying soldiers, while in Arab areas, they were sold at low prices. The German consul at Mosul reported that the maximum price for Armenian women was \\"5 piastres\\". Karen Jeppe, who was working for the League of Nations in Aleppo and was attempting to have released the tens of thousands of women and children who had been abducted, said in 1926 that out of the thousands of women she had spoken to, only one had not been sexually abused. R√∂ssler, the German consul in Aleppo during the genocide, heard from an \\"objective\\" Armenian that around a quarter of young women, whose appearance was \\"more or less pleasing\\", were regularly raped by the gendarmes, and that \\"even more beautiful ones\\" were violated by 10-15 men. This resulted in girls and women being left behind dying, naked.  War crimes trials  Following the end of World War I, the British exerted pressure on the Sultan to bring to trial the leadership of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) for crimes against humanity. By April 1919 over 100 Turkish officials had been arrested. Testimony given by Nuri, the police chief of Trabzon, claimed that he had given young girls, as a gift from the governor-general to the CUP central committee. A merchant by name of Mehmed Ali testified that not only were children being killed at the Red Crescent Hospital, but that young girls were also being raped and that the governor-general held there fifteen girls for his sexual gratification. Hasan Maruf, a military officer, testified to the British that \\"Government officials at Trebizond picked out some of the prettiest Armenian women of the best families. After committing the worst outrages on them, they had them killed.\\" The court found the Lieutenant governor Kemal Bey, of the district of Yozgat, guilty of murder and forced relocation; he was given the death penalty. Major Tevfik Bey, a commander of police was also found guilty and was given a 16-year prison sentence.\\" Footnotes References Bibliography       Category:Armenian Genocide Category:Crimes against women Armenian Category:Christianity in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Rape during the Armenian Genocide"},{"id":"42153373","text":"Antoni Abad talking at Radio Web MACBA.

Drawing, engraving, sign writing, performance, sculpture, film, music, theatre, and poetry were interwoven through Rossell's work, creating an extremely personal conception in which the artwork is a process of constant reinvention. Rossell fashioned a poetics of fragility tinged with irony and a critical spirit, and delved into the micro-worlds that are generally ignored by the absolutist accounts of art history. Though abstract in appearance, his work has a strong narrative component, which modestly and discreetly draws on the artist's own biography.  Biography  In 1964, he moved to Paris, where he lived for many years. While based there, he travelled widely and spent long periods in other countries, including India and Nepal. Also in Paris at that time were Joan Rabascall, Antoni Miralda and Jaume Xifra, close friends of Rossell with whom, despite differences in professional background, he worked on a number of projects. With them, for instance, Rossell filmed Cerimonials (Ceremonials) (1974), part of the MACBA Collection, celebrations and rituals in which Doroth√©e Selz participated as well. In Paris, he took film classes with Jean Rouch at the Comit√© del Film Etnogr√°fico. During those years, Rossell also studied at the Universit√© du Th√©√¢tre des Nations, a crucial experience where he first heard of total theatre, understood as an action that brings the concepts of celebration and ritual to bear on the dramatic arts. Rossell himself described these experiences as: > ... closer to signic representation than text. I came into contact with > languages whose codes I was wholly unfamiliar with, languages without codes > for me. I found them fascinating, and they were quite possibly the origin of > the language that I have cultivated throughout my artistic trajectory, which > comes from a multiplicity of signs, icons, micrographies, calligrams or > benigrams without a code, unrepeated and unrepeatable, that coexist, > articulate and manifest themselves in a manner that is always unique, always > reinvented, and that in the end form a micro-theatre or calligraphic > representation of the great micro-theatre of the world.

Plot Based in the dusty plains of North India, Guddu Rangeela is a story about two cousins trying to make ends meet in the crime infested surroundings. Rangeela (Arshad Warsi) and Guddu (Amit Sadh) are orchestra singers by day and informants by night, acquiring measly pay offs from the information provided to local gangsters about the richest families in town, has fetched them an easy and safe way to subsist without getting their hands dirty in the bargain. Although cousins by blood, both are very much unlike each other. The love hate rapport of the two comes to be seen through the many dangerously funny circumstances that they are met with and their impromptu methods of saving their skin each time. Having suffered a tragic past at the hands of the gang lord turned politician Billu Pahalwan (Ronit Roy); the antagonist of the tale; both are discreetly entangled in a 10-year- old legal battle against him through Gupta, an honest advocate fighting on their behalf. While the unorthodox and impulsive Guddu aspires to grow out of their hand to mouth way of life by executing the loot themselves, the comparatively self-righteous and mature Rangeela despises the idea of getting onto the dark side of the city's law. Like money, women too are Guddu's poison, who is time and again seen flirting and effortlessly pulling off one night stands. Rangeela on the contrary hasn't moved on from the tragedy that consumed his only love Babli (Shriswara) years back. Rangeela's prime motto has always been to overthrow his nemesis Billo, thus undoing the injustice and cruelty that transpired years back. Lucky enough, one such opportunity comes knocking. They kidnap Baby (Aditi Rao Hydari) looking to make an easy 1 million money in the process. In the process finds himself confronting the vicious and tyrannical Billo. What follows is a chaotic tale of redemption and payback. An ambition, a plan, a kidnapping and a To-and-Fro tale of victory and defeat leading up to a dramatic climax.

Walter Barnett, was an Australian photographer and filmmaker. Barnett was a prominent portrait photographer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, establishing the successful Falk studios in Sydney. Later in his career he was based in London, England, with studios at Hyde Park Corner and Knightsbridge. Barnett became involved in filmmaking after meeting cinematographer Marius Sestier in 1896, and with Sestier made some of the first films shot in Australia.  Life and career  Barnett was born on 25 January 1862 in St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia, one of seven children of English-born Jewish parents Lewis Barnett, a merchant, and his wife Alice Jacobs. He left school at the age of 13 and began his photographic career as a studio assistant, later establishing a studio in Hobart, Tasmania with his business partner Harold Riise. In 1884 he sold his share of the Hobart studio, after which he travelled and worked variously in London and the United States. During his time in London he was employed by the society photographers W. & D. Downey, where he assisted in photographing the future King Edward VII. Henry Parkes, photographed by Barnett in 1893 In 1885 Barnett founded the Falk studios in Sydney, at which he established himself as one of Australia's leading portrait photographers. He opened a second studio in Melbourne in 1895. He was known in particular for photographing stage stars and other celebrities; one of his best-known sitters was Sarah Bernhardt, who sat for him while visiting Australia in 1891. Other prominent visitors to Australia photographed by Barnett were Robert Louis Stevenson in 1893 and Mark Twain in 1896. One of his most notable works was a photograph of Henry Parkes, in which according to Ennis (2004), Parkes \\"plays the role of a wise old man whose intense expression is evocative of a seer's\\". Barnett married Hilda \\"Ella\\" Frances Clement Forbes in 1889. In 1896 Barnett met French cinematographer Marius Sestier, an agent of early filmmakers the Lumi√®re brothers assigned to demonstrate their cin√©matographe abroad. Barnett and Sestier began making films together, starting with a short film of passengers disembarking from the ship S.S. Brighton in Manly, which was the first film shot and screened in Australia. They made approximately 19 films together in Sydney and Melbourne, most notably a film of the 1896 Melbourne Cup horse race. Barnett directed the films while Sestier operated the cin√©matographe, and in the Melbourne Cup film Barnett is seen on camera encouraging spectators to wave their hats as the horses cross the finish line. The Melbourne Cup film was premiered at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne on 19 November 1896. It was covered in the Australian press, including The Age and The Bulletin, and has been cited as Australia's first film production. In 1897 Barnett relocated to London and established a photography studio at Hyde Park Corner, later adding a second studio in Knightsbridge. He joined photographic society The Linked Ring in 1899, was a founder member of the Professional Photographers Association (later the British Institute of Professional Photography) in 1901, and was elected to the Royal Photographic Society council in 1903. In 1904 he published a collection of photographs of his most notable sitters, titled A List of Well Known People Photographed by H. Walter Barnett. He exhibited a collection of photographs of British Armed Forces personnel of World War I in 1917, titled Warriors All. Barnett sold his London studios in 1920 and moved to Dieppe, France, where he maintained a keen interest in contemporary French art. He died in Nice on 16 January 1934, aged 71.

Early history  Thomas was a descendant of the Norman Montgomery family who were sub-lieutenants of Earl Ferrer, Earl of Derby, whose chief domain was Tutbury Castle, on the county border of Derbyshire and Staffordshire from 1080 and 1264. This junior Montgomery branch originates from the Welsh borders branch of Montgomery, who arrived with Duke William in 1066. The Derbyshire Montgomerys held manors around the Tutbury area being; Rolleston, Marston, Cubley, and Marchington and were charged with Forest administration services for the vast Needwood Forest which was overseen by the Ferrers Earls of Derby as a royal forest. They also provided Knight services. Thomas Marchington's family line seems to have died out as no direct trace can be found. Cubley church tower displays armorial arms of the Montgomery family along with one Marchington display; facing the church is the remains of the Montgomery old house. He sat as the MP for Derbyshire in 1380, 1382 and 1383. He died c.1397 and was interred in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, however there is no physical grave or memorial for him that exist to this day.

It was built about 1927, and includes a manor house and outbuildings constructed as a hunting lodge for George A. Ellis, a prominent New York financier and co-founder of E. F. Hutton & Co. The manor house is a 1 1/2-story, asymmetrical brick building with a rectangular central mass, and two single story wings--an American interpretation of the Shavian Manor Style, defined by the neo-medieval work of the English architect Richard Norman Shaw. Also on the property are four outbuildings in the Shavian Manor Style: a carriage house, dog house, guest house, and gate house. Additional features of the property include a one-story log house, three one-story frame cabins, a cemetery, and archaeological remains of the original 18th and 19th century rice plantation. In 1963 the property was sold to the Low Country Girl Scout Council, who maintained it as a camp until 2011. The property was sold, via absolute auction, to a private buyer in 2013 but remains under the terms of a conservation easement. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Unfortunately, the ranch-hands would rather perform songs with Betty Lou than punch cattle, so Cyclone lets them go. Not that this improves things, because now there's the matter of replacing them. Dale does so‚Äîby hiring female ranch- hands. The women prove capable and lively, and all is well, notwithstanding Betty Lou who now has no one to flirt with‚Äîthat is, until Roy and his sidekick Keno show up, begging for jobs. Cyclone hires them as cooks, which results in amateur-chef Roy giving everyone a case of Montezuma's Revenge. So that pretty much takes care of that. But soon Roy is in everyone's good stead, proving his worth as a two-fisted, cattle-ropin', ballad-singin' genius. Naturally, Betty Lou goes gaga for him, but it's Dale who falls in love. A subplot is thrown in involving a foreman who skulks around the countryside, bilking people out of their money. At one point, he manages to steal every horse on Cyclone's ranch and frame Roy in the process. But Trigger gallops to the rescue, hooves flying, almost trampling the thief. The stolen horses are retrieved and Roy's name is cleared. Cyclone agrees to hire back the male ranch-hands he fired, but only after pairing them off with one female ranch hand each: otherwise, that oversexed vixen Betty Lou would never leave them alone.
